0,Elksom,"July 25, 2019",5,"My favorite app I used to rely on the standard Apple weather app that is pre-installed on the iPhone to receive all my forecast knowledge. I had been using it for years to check the weather and daily temp until one day my mother told me to check the radar... what radar? “The radar on the weather channel app,” she replied. "
1,Honey Moon Pie,"October 15, 2019",1,"What happened I liked the fact that being older than dirt I could put this on my iPad and make things bigger so that I could see and read everything. I liked the setup except that as with all things meteorologists have a harder time knowing what is going to happen and make guesses as to times of stuff. GOd still has control on most things and weather seems to be changing in our world also. So old age is not the only things that change in life.  Why everyone uses light gray writing on a white background and expect someone to be able to see it is idiotic at best. I know all of the younger generation may like new update but I personally liked the old one best. There may have been a few things to change but wish you would make so people had a choice. Older people seem to never get a choice any more. At least there are many more apps I can go to and pray to find one I like. Thanks for nothing but causing me more problems with computers which I am getting ever more aggravated with. Not all old people want so many changes in their later years. Every time I finally get used to something, you geniuses decide to change all around. Just getting used to phones and iPads and all their changes every other day is enough to drive someone crazy and I don’t need any help since as you get older people don’t give me credit for having a lot of common since anyway! Thanks at least for trying to please all the people in the world."
2,FormerWeatherAppFan,"January 17, 2020",1,"WEATHER APP TO PREMIUM UPGRADE NOT WORKING!!!! I have had the Weather App for many years, including the add free version. Then suddenly I saw features pulled back from the $3.99 Version and got an offer for premium going from $3.99 to $9.99 to basically get the same features I had before. I decided to pay for the Premium version and that is when the problems began. At first my ipad kept showing the adds without premium features, then when I tried to manage my subscriptions, It got rid of the adds on some of the screen, but when I click on some of the extended features (such as the extended hours tab) the app crashes every time. I tried to delete the Weather App on the ipad without luck and then from all devices and reload them, and now my iphone is also not showing extended premium features and also showing adds. If, I try to get refund I am told that I can only cancel the subscription starting at the end of initial subscription year which is at the end of 2020 (this year fee not refundable) but I can use the application until the end of the year (with advertisements). I have submitted multiple support requests online, since December 22, to the Weather App/IBM and the only response I get is ""the we will get to you as quickly as possible"" from each of the initial contacts. Furthermore, their FAQ and support pages do not have anything to say about what to do with premium features installation failure."
3,IbuSaja,"February 6, 2020",1,"Disappointed Updated Comments:  The app has gone from bad to totally unusable.  The “current location” feature gives me the weather and alerts for an area that is 20 miles away.  This is particularly annoying and dangerous on severe weather days.  Further I repeatedly get notifications about about what the weather will be like tomorrow in different area area that 20 miles away from where I live, in a completely different direction.  To make matters worse, when I try and report the errors, the email address provided within the app come back with a delivery failure because it is invalid.  After years of loving the Weather Channel on so many levels, and trusting them to keep me informed and safe, I am done.  Wish I could give this app a negative star rating.  "
4,Mikesaysstopit,"February 5, 2020",1,"Zero stars I never write reviews. I had to for this one. I’ve had this app as long as I remember. 2010 maybe??? And I’ve always loved it. Accurate and easy to use. Fantastic really. Gave me what I needed and nothing more. Now there’s all this junk. Pure, useless, clickbait junk. Pop up ads everywhere! I like knowing where to touch the screen with a little muscle memory so I can get through my task of getting the weather and getting on with my life. But now this app has sold out SO hard I feel like I’m using a 1998 pc with no virus protection! And it’s not even poorly done! It’s strategic and timed perfectly so the screen moves at the perfect time so my finger correctly hits the ad and not the option I wanted. Effectively navigating me away from the app to a completely irrelevant  ad that’s been tailored to me by the cookies I’ve agreed to use this app, that I’m not even going to look at because I’m now frustrated and trying to get back to my weather app. What over-paid executive approved this ridiculously bad interface? And why? So I can do a sinkhole video I won’t believe? The same sinkhole video that came out 8 months ago on 30 other apps that EVERYONE uses? Way to waste A TON OF MONEY ON NOTHING weather channel! All you did was make me use the weather app that came with my phone I that never really liked. Perfect case of if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Just bring back Joe Cantore. That’s all you had to do."
5,Bsadle,"June 9, 2019",1,"Money grab developers strike again Back a few years ago in the early days of the App Store, probably 8-10 years ago in fact, I purchased the ad free version of this app called Weather Channel Max. Good app, no ads and it worked well. Then about 2-3 years ago the app updated and said that this app will no longer be supported and that would be the final update. It stated the other version(the one with ads) would be the only version supported. I continued to use the app I paid for until it kept crashing after iOS updates and was pretty much forced to use the app with ads. Now I see you can go premium on this app and remove ads. That really ticks me off considering I had previously paid for the ad free version, only to have them snub it. I, at first, just thought they were only getting rid of max so they would force those who paid a one time fee for the ad free version back on the app that has ads. Not only was that true, but now, in hopes that people would forget(which I didn’t) they now offer a monthly subscription service to get rid of ads. This is a sad attempt at getting even more money from me. I will now be deleting the app and using another app instead. I’ve already given enough money to you all only to be asked for more. I’m really disappointed how greedy developers are becoming and all over an app that gives you mediocre weather reports."
6,joshybigmac,"December 22, 2019",1,Monetization is a Cancer in this App I live in snow country and I’ve always relied on the snowfall layers of the radar. I would have never updated this app if it meant that I’d have to pay a completely bogus fee of at least $10 a year just to be able to use the same feature that was free yesterday. The only thing that’s been accomplished by this app’s updates this year is a successive migration of its user base away from the app. I’m surprised I’ve held out this long but I cannot keep using an app that doesn’t want to be used.
7,Cmiester,"February 5, 2020",2,"Used to be 5 stars As life continues in this Land of the Free Market, we see more and more “monthly subscriptions” as alternatives to pesky ads and better performance. BUT THIS APP HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THE WORST APP TO DO IT TO. I mean seriously?!? I’ve had this app for YEARS. It was the best performing, most accurate, and user friendly weather app out there. It exceeded all these built in apps and that annoyingly wrong weather-bug thingy (that was a joke for the ones that’ll miss it) when it came to reliability. "
8,Havin'Fun-in-Louisiana,"May 9, 2019",1,"Could be great app if it worked When it works I like the app.  I like the changes and if it loads it is a useful tool.  For me the videos and weather updates are very good.  Not sure what the problem is, but for some reason and this seems to happen frequently — the app doesn’t load (spinning disk) or it just crashes and restarts and then back to spinning disk. So if it loads (might work for days and then not work for days) it is a good app.  I have noticed the app works best in places with high speed internet.  In a place outside or in a place that lacks high speed internet or great cell service, the app just won’t open quickly (maybe 5-10 mins to open).  I have an iPhone X with the newest software and the newest version of the app, so I don’t think it is the phone.  Anyway, if the stability can be improved and it can open quickly than it would be a great app."
9,Jr High Teach,"August 30, 2018",1,New Update RUINED this app! UPDATED REVIEW: 
10,master red fox,"February 24, 2018",4,"Weather variety multiple locations I have had this app for awhile and use it to not only get local weather but weather for various locations for my son's work travel as surprisingly conditions vary greatly within a 50 mile area which one needs to know if commuting. I get road conditions and various alerts ( rain, snow, lighting, etc) per area. All helpful. Last year because of the reports I got, I saved my son an unnecessary trip because of the weather report. I enjoy the various videos also. "
11,R50an,"August 28, 2018",5,"New Update Nonsense I don’t know why the weather channel felt the need to completely overhaul the layout and design of their app. The previous version, which I had used daily for the last handful of years, was by all accounts a perfect weather app. "
12,A disgruntled consumer99,"September 1, 2018",2,"Bad Update This used to be my favorite 5 star weather app. I love to track weather and preparing for my day each day by using the TWC app but that all changed with this new update. First of all I do not wear sunscreen and base my outfits on the uv index and that has now been removed. Next the app used to be easy to navigate and get all the relevant weather information for the day as well as some great videos that I would watch in the morning as I wake up, but now the app is confusing with too much going on. I understand in today’s world to stay relevant you need to make change but this change was not for the better, to confusing now and hard to find information. I feel bad for all the sponsors that would pay for spots in the videos because based on the way the videos are set up I bet less people will watch them, I know I no longer will. I hope that TWC can fix this app and make it more user friendly again with an easy to find uv index. I am not deleting the app yet but until it is changed I will no longer use the app and will start downloading new weather apps in hopes of finding a suitable daily replacement. I hope this does not fall on deaf ears, the TWC app was the best but not anymore. Thank you and have a great day."
13,Buckeye chris,"September 4, 2018",2,Why change it? I’m sorry but I dislike the new update. It has made the app a lot less user friendly. It’s difficult to navigate and to find specific information. I don’t understand why you think people would like this? We want simple and convenient. If you fixed the small font and color schemes that alone would help drastically. The important information is almost hidden now. For instance the current temperature is so small I need glasses to see it. 
14,Barometerbabe,"September 8, 2018",1,"Does not deserve one star for this update GIVE US BACK THE OLD APP!!! This is no concise weather report. And: Bad background; bad graphics; bad set up. Too many ads, too many screen options. The best weather information is plain and simple (as this app used to be): current conditions, forecast, radar, and then the other options like future forecasts, air quality, etc. "
15,Walterwilson0315,"September 18, 2018",1,"Way too much The new app is a very, very negative change. The old navigation was fine and did not need an overhaul because this is just a weather app. There’s WAY TOO MUCH extra stuff involved with this app, and I really don’t understand why these guys try so hard to make it entertaining. It’s literally just the weather, I’m not looking to be entertained and I doubt anyone else opens up the weather channel app like “oh boy it’s time to have a good time”. We just want to see a forecast and a radar and that’s it. The air pollution number also seems completely inaccurate because it’s different every time I open my app. Not to mention the recent discovery of a weather channel weatherman pretending to be pushed around by winds that just weren’t there. To the point where he’s babbling about the storm being in the middle of an intense surge or something like that, meanwhile a couple of pedestrians walk behind him wearing shorts and hoodies, not affected by the wind at all. Plus, he’s visibly fighting the wind in the opposite direction that it’s blowing. You can see plants blowing in the opposite direction of where he’s pushing. That being said, I feel like all the weather on here anymore is exaggerated because they think it’s entertaining to people. It’s really just a nuisance and the reason I’m getting a new weather app."
16,Frustrated former app user,"October 13, 2018",2,"Less useful since update 2018 I used this app multiple times per day in the past but since the 2018 update, I have hardly used it at all. The data is accurate.  It is hard to find the info you need.  They now have boxes on the screen with different info. The screen is so chopped up you can’t see enough of any one thing to figure out what it is. The previous version was better when current details were on the first screen and you could scroll down to whatever section you need. There was enough info on the screen to understand and you had the option to tap an arrow to get more detailed info if you wish. Now I see 2 or 3 words, then a box with an ad, then 4 or 5 words and then another ad. Nothing is obvious that you can tap to get more details.  I hate tapping all over the screen to figure out what gives more details since the first screen is useless and there is nothing to indicate how to get details. Please revise back similar to the previous functionality which was efficient and obvious how to operate the app!"
17,HenryAppleuser123,"January 31, 2019",4,"Good overall but needs improvement I use to enjoy the app and most importantly the interactive map. I really like it because not only can you read the weather, but you can also visualize it and I think that brings a new way of informing someone when looking at the weather. I think this is important because it could possibly help someone better understand what they are looking at and it also serves for educational purposes and that goes a long way when helping someone understand the intended message that trying to be sent. You never want any miscommunications. Anyway, I like the app overall but with the recent update, the layers of the interactive map now cover the whole screen and I find that kind of confusing and bothersome. For example, the temperature layer now covers the entire map instead of just the land masses. I’m my opinion, I think it was better before when it only covered the land masses and that applies for all the other layers like UV index etc. So if you can change it back to that, that would be great. Thank you for your time and keep up with the great work. Go weather channel."
18,E'sAppreview,"December 31, 2019",2,"Used to be a great app The Weather Channel App used to be a great App. Now I find it difficult to even open. I touch to open and it immediately closes, so I have to tap a second time. It then takes 20-30 seconds to open. Once the app is open an Upgrade to Premium screen appears first (for a fee).  It freezes as I’m using it and I have to close and reopen to get it to work. See steps above that have to be repeated when it freezes. It is slow to respond to screen swiping or moving from one to another. "
19,Mom24monsters,"September 17, 2019",2,"Constant reminders to go premium when I already have and no accessibility support for Apple Watch. I think this app would be great if it worked for everybody on every device, but they seem to have left out those of us who use voiceover, who need to know what the weather is too. It’s not all about the sighted people! I’m trying to figure out why those of us who use voiceover should have to pay full price for premium when everything doesn’t work for us? Also, I’m getting really tired of the constant reminders to go premium, when I already have. I have to go and tell it that I want to go premium first, for it to tell me that I already am, before the stupid thing will go away until the next senseless time it pops up. Until these things are fixed, we shouldn’t be charged to use the app. There’s not a whole lot of premium quality to go in premium when you have a visual impairment and most of the stuff doesn’t work with voiceover, something that’s built into the iOS, and there’s no excuse for it to not work with it. Also, I’m trying to figure out why, if this app is included, even if it’s a dumbed down version of it, with iOS, does it have completely different forecasts? The temperatures don’t always match either."
20,reallyisittaken???,"September 8, 2018",1,Catastrophe Hate the update and redesign. What a mess . . .
21,ArdenBailey,"December 14, 2018",3,"I liked the old App better! Ever since the update my weather channel app is super glitchy. When I go to watch videos I have to watch an ad before every single one(the same ad over and over), this was not true for the old app. Also, if I click on the video and the ad plays but I scroll down to make it picture in picture and still browse the other videos... if I’m not at the video I initially wanted to watch when the ad ends and the screen goes black, when I try to click on it to bring up full screen it doesn’t work. Then, I have to click on a different video and then go back and am forced to watch the ad again. Also, if I am watching a video and the video ends and I’m in full screen, it immediately starts playing an ad(the same one I watched before the video) and the icon to minimize full screen is completely missing. I have to exit my app and go all the way back in just to watch a new video. I used to be an avid Weather Channel user but not anymore... I hardly even used it for the weather I just liked the nature/science related videos, and I can’t even do that anymore."
22,Lise P.,"March 6, 2019",1,"Notifications no longer work! The Notifications NO LONGER WORK on this app!!! No matter how many times I try to enable them it doesn’t work, I just keep getting the “ERROR - Unable to change your alerts at this time. Please try again later.” I’m talking every single day for the last few MONTHS. And why did my notifications shut off in the first place? It’s important to me to get severe weather updates because I live in a tornado prone area, TWC used to be a source for this but  isn’t anymore. And BTW, shouldn’t that be a PRIORITY for TWC? (I have contacted App support multiple times to no avail.)"
23,Lora K Kay,"March 10, 2019",2,"Change Is Not Always Good... I have used The Weather Channel app since I got my first iPhone 4, over any other weather app, and I’m now deleting it from my phone. I have given the new interface a long trial and the “fixes” have not improved this awful design. The adds overtake the screen, the graph is useless and I can no longer find real weather information that I can use. Three out of ten slides on the “Weather Snapshot” are related to my area with little information. The other seven are ads, international stories or ads disguised as stories. AND... this is not a unique look. It looks just like a FB Story, which was not an improvement on FB either. In order to get a TRUE weather Snapshot, I have to scroll through 6 other slides, the first which is usually a sensationalized video, and the second which is a tiny radar map. The aspects which most affect me are not seen until the 3rd, 4th and 5th slide, which often stick when scrolling through and lead to an unintentional advertisement opening. All of the information used to be right at my fingertips with a simple scroll for allergies, air quality and other details pertinent to me. Goodbye, Weather Channel!"
24,fbfbbckdjsbfncjjvjdbfkvjc,"June 7, 2019",1,"We want Weather and not Water; been reliable till the IBM When the Weather Company owned The  Weather Channel the weather was much more reliable. This channel focused on weather and not water. It had people who cared not for money, but for the safety of people. They had people down on the scene of a wildfire or a hurricane or a tornado! Now the IBM is saying they care for people but do they really? The IBM splits its business for agriculture, water, and other things; it does not only focus on  weather like the former weather channel does. Yes, it is important that people around the world get water, hence The Water Channel, but this is not a charity app it is a weather app. The name chance shows everyone that this is no longer a reliable app. The premium option backs me up. The most reliable sorce you can get it only 48 hours out. Anything behind that is something unreliable; something you are fake selling people to get there money. The wind could shift and change everything. 48 hours is the furthest most reliable source there is. Also why is it not giving me accurate alerts for rain, lightning, pollen, or anything? Oh look it started raining... where is my alert. And hmmmm the radar says that it’s not..... like I said we want Weather and not Water."
25,carolinelynchminor,"August 28, 2019",1,"Give back favorite locations! Below is my previous feedback comments! Here is the latest! So, I got the update. I went to the app settings. I tried to add features, but received the message that I must first add to my favorites!!! Good grief! There is no way to add favorites anymore! Remember.... Add to My Favorite????!!!!! It is definitely gone from the options!!!! Frustratingly ridiculous!!!! And, very maddening! "
26,Saturatesinger,"June 28, 2019",1,"If you’re a fan of conspiracy videos and anything BUT the weather This app, the meteorologists involved, and the channel have all gone steadily downhill in both the accuracy and presentation of their work.  Want to know if it’s going to rain?  Well, that’s fine, open the app, click on hourly, click the list, select the particular hour, and you’ve finally gotten yourself to a page that has a 2% chance of being correct about the weather at any given time.  Rain predictions are always wildly off, temperatures are inaccurate, the future radar’s accuracy is nothing short of a joke, the app is overwhelmed by clickbait videos and hidden ads, and the “weather alerts” are both excessive and incorrect.  Weather channel, you are NOT a nonprofit, you have one job (as Loki said “just the one!”) that you are PAID to do, and to be honest you don’t do it well at all.  It is currently drizzling in my area, one minute ago the app claimed no rain, now the app says I have severe hail and thunderstorms in my area....nope, not at all correct.  All these shortcomings, and still, now, you have the nerve to create a subscription service out of your features?  Lost faith, going elsewhere, please find time in your lives to do your one job with at least the minimum standards of care or accuracy."
27,lisanicoleiannarino4887,"October 19, 2019",2,"very glitchy app while it’s informative and sometimes accurate, the app itself is a pain to use. it constantly crashes on open and needs restarted. it’s super slow. they constantly ask me to PAY FOR PREMIUM which is ludicrous. why would i pay for a weather forecast? it’s like you’ve designed the app to operate poorly to get people to pay for the premium. no thanks. they also share data and are one of the worst as far as surveillance of what you do online."
28,bowinick,"December 14, 2019",1,"4 emails sent to Support and no response Purchased one month premium of TWC And my subscription was removed by them. I have tried to restore my subscription a dozen times, trying everything to get it re-stored. Emailed TWC four times now no response. Possible issue with when we delete our personal data. Seemed occurred after I tried it. I am able to restore the subscription on 2 iPad mini II’s (even after deleting personal data - ios 12 on old ipads) but not on my iPhone. It’s obvious that TWC is mainly interested in throwing a lot of advertisement and making people pay monthly subscriptions for premium weather service. They believe this is the future for all of us on how we will get their so called premium Weather service on an app. Too many ads and too many pop-ups wanting you to purchase the premium service which of course I already have. TWC really blew it. How do you make it up to all these angry customers having so many issues. It should not be rated at 4.6?? I begin to question Apple’s rating system which is probably no better than Amazons. Good luck to everyone trying to find your premium weather apps."
29,Thegymbum,"November 29, 2019",1,"Used to love this app. For years I’ve loved this app and used it constantly. However the past few updates have made me use it less and less until I finally decided to delete it and go back to the default apple weather app. Several issues- the ads have become overwhelming. I’ve noticed there are far more ads than there used to be, even when you first open the app. There are long ads between every single video, (sometimes as long as or longer than the videos themselves and you can’t skip it after a few seconds like on most app. Even worse, is usually the exact same ad over and over so if you want to watch more than 1 video, you keep having to watch the same ad as long as 30 seconds for just a 30 video. Not worth it. Probbaly the worst change is that is been draining my battery rapidly since a recent update, and even does so with low power mode turned on which should disable background app activity. I looked into the battery problem and in the last week the weather channel had used 35% of all battery use, despite only briefly checking the weather a few times a day and occasionally watching a video. I will miss it, but sadly it’s not worth it anymore!"
30,happygodavid,"March 10, 2018",1,"It was great, then terrible, then good, then terrible... The original WC app back in the day was pretty solid. I paid the $4 for the ad free version. That version of the app was, hands down, the best weather app that has ever existed in the App Store. "
31,K Rae Reed,"August 29, 2018",5,"Essential I’m a pilot so my life revolves around the weather. I don’t just look at the weather, I live IN the Weather. The professional meteorologists at the Weather Chanel give you the best you can get from the same raw sources available to me as a pilot. I check the Weather Chanel app more than any other app on my phone. They do an outstanding job explaining important concepts which give you the How And Why things work with the weather. I am a flight instructor and one of the first things I ask my new students is if they have the Weather Chanel app so they can track radar and see current weather unfold. I also assign for them to watch Weather Underground as much as possible. I learn something new from them every night. I admire every one of your on air meteorologists and kudos to the crew behind the scenes. There is someone behind the camera in the hurricane to thank. You give your all and have given your lives too. Thank you for all you do from a huge fan."
32,TomahawkD23,"August 29, 2018",3,"Big Issue I am currently have problems with the new app that I can’t turn on notifications to receive significant weather advisories, daily rain/snow events, and pollen notifications. In the old app all those notifications where on. But when the new app downloaded they turned off and now I can’t turn them one. I once I’ve selected the notifications I want and press done, a screen comes up saying select a location. I look under locations, it’s blank, nothing shows up. I go back to the home screen. My current location is showing. I try again turning back on the notifications, I still am not being allowed to to select a location or is that part of the app syncing to my location like the home screen did. In my settings I have my current location turned to always on, still nothing. I used to rely on these notifications because I live in tornado alley so I guess it’s a good thing I also have a weather radio too. The Weather Channel app is now useless to me. I guess I rely on my weather radio now to keep my family safe!"
33,Roll out update,"September 16, 2018",1,New update and coverage of Florence New update is weirdly busy and hard to read and this is coming from a weather junkie. I had a hard time figuring out what those squiggly lines were for and yep supposed to be for day night-why? 
34,YayaHB,"September 28, 2018",1,Horrible “Improvements”= Form over substance Or “Don’t risk a facelift when you’re already pretty good looking!” 
35,sgwilso4,"October 17, 2018",4,"Widget glitching Since I have searched and searched and can't find a way to contact the weather channel, here's a review with my issues. Since the latest update my widget in the Notification Center hasn't been updating properly. It will continue to have a ""current temperature"" from sometime earlier in the day. Even if I click on it and open the app, the current temp will not change. "
36,Rokair,"October 18, 2019",1,"Well it would be ok if it worked I hated that my favorite weather application with all sorts of features, smartly updated often, and simply works very well had to stop using the data from the weather channel as an option since the weather channel decided to no longer sell it to other application makers.  "
37,CStrong4044,"October 22, 2019",2,"Really? Upon opening this app you’ll wait a good 20 seconds to get past the blue startup screen. From there it’ll load your last location before pulling your gps location, so you wait for it to load and it shows you an irrelevant earlier location. Then it pulls your gps location, it reloads, and shows you your current location weather. About 45 seconds after loading the app on a brand new device you will be able to access the weather. From there you better hope you don't pull downwards too far or you’ll refresh and start over! So after you’ve wasted a minute now you're provided with a pretty comprehensive review of the weather, with an interactive radar that is pretty nice and accurate compared to other apps (why I give 2 stars instead of 1).  But wait, theres more! NOW THEY WANT YOU TO PAY FOR AN ADD FREE/FASTER/MORE ACCURATE VERSION?!?!?! Thats the solution to a buggy app huh? No wonder the app never works because it’s constantly generating the best location specific ad!!!"
38,StormHeart501,"June 19, 2019",5,"Great app I like this app because it is easy to use and highly accurate, I would highly suggest it to any of my friends who believe their weather app give inaccurate information and or they don’t like the functionality of the app they are presently using. I don’t have any REAL complaints other than sometimes I have to completely close and reopen the app for it to update on the temperature at the moment, it’s not necessarily giving incorrect information, I mean it kind of is but all I have to do is close it and reopen it. So if you could possibly fix it so it updates like maybe every few minutes so that I hopefully won’t have to constantly have to close and reopen the app every time I use it I would highly appreciate it. <3 but other than that the app is amazing and I would NO DOUBTS request it to my friends, in fact I found out about this app through my mom. But anyhow that’s all for now, please do consider my suggestion ❤️❤️❤️"
39,jmscanlo,"March 27, 2020",1,"Not as good as it used to be I've had this app forever. And years ago it used to be great and up to date. But the past year or so, it's been horrible. It freezes a lot. It crashes constantly and doesn't give you accurate weather reports. I'm constantly double checking other weather sources because I can't rely on this app alone. It's unfortunate because it used to be my go-to weather app. But it's just not what it used to be."
40,Dr Mike 1,"February 8, 2018",5,"Great weather app! Does a nice accurate job.   It had everything until about 2 weeks ago when suddenly, the temperature badge stopped being displayed on my iPhone’s home screen.  The temperature badge allowed me to glance at my iPhone and see what the current temperature was without even opening The Weather app.  Additionally, I’ve noticed that my name disappears everyday under the settings menu within the app.  I add my name and save it and the next day, it’s gone.   I checked ALL my settings within the app, I’m running the latest iOS version, and I’ve checked my notifications setting on my iPhone.  I have emailed the app support, but still nothing.  I received an automated reply telling me that their support people have received my email about these issues and that “they’ll get right on it”.   That was about 5 days ago.  Problems still exist and NO one has contacted me.  This app is losing stars everyday."
41,Mamacitaslg,"April 1, 2018",3,"Soooo many inconsistencies.... For example:  Currently, there’s a warning rolling across the top of opening page. It states that there’s a winter storm warning from midnight through tomorrow at 1pm for 3-5” of snow with up to 6” in some areas. When scrolling down and looking at the detailed daily report for tonight and then tomorrow, it states a less than 1” tonight, and tomorrow 1-3” snow possible.  Hence, huge discrepancies and inconsistencies, often.  Very annoying. "
42,Rev Jude,"May 27, 2018",1,Stupid and also very inaccurate. First reason I call it stupid is because they name the snowstorms. I don’t know who came up with that stupid idea but the weather channel but it’s the most stupidest idea I’ve ever heard of naming a snowstorm give me a break. Also the next you know they’re going to name tsunami‘s earthquakes and every time we get a thunderstorm they’re going to name it. Plus their forecasts are always in accurate for where I live. I depend on the weather I can’t expect them to tell me what it’s going to be like in my area. I find that the cable weather is way off also and I don’t trust him. I also use storm in weather underground including the weather channel itself and they are the most stupidest apps to have. They are also very inaccurate and I don’t trust him. I have decided to delete their apps on my phone. I like to rock storms and when I found out from this app including the others if they do have if you can’t track a storm. This app is garbage for anyone who loves the weather. Anything the weather Channel has offer is all garbage. They don’t track storms do you know Kim good forecast in for anyone that Sirius about protecting the weather don’t use this crap.
43,CLS_1980,"September 1, 2018",1,TERRIBLE UPDATE!!! I tried to contact customer support before leaving this review.  There is no way to do that so here it is.  I have had this app on mi iPad and iPhone for years.  It used to work beautifully.  I even paid to have ads removed.  Later on I discovered location issues within the widgets on both devices.  Then my precise location was deleted in the search.  Aside from those things all was well.
44,jenpilch13,"September 8, 2018",2,App update is disappointing to say the least! The new weather app update is disappointing. The font/graphics are hard to see because they are so light and fine. The graph is not necessary and makes looking at the weather confusing and too much stimuli all at once. Who need that graph any way? The background is now white instead of blue again making the graphics hard to see. I like looking at the hour by hour top to bottom like before and now it’s L-R. The 2 weathers for each day is too confusing at a glance. If I want details I like clicking and reading about that but at a glance it’s way too much information. I have so much more to say about it but I don’t have hours to write a review. I have been using it now for 3 weeks or so and have tried to get used to it but I just can’t. I don’t like it at all. It has been brought up by almost everyone I talk to who used the old one and no one likes the new update. Please please go back or improve this new design. I loved this app before now and used it all the time! Now I dread looking at the weather and get annoyed trying to navigate the new app. 😢😤😠😡☀️❄️☔️🌪🌥🌦🌨
45,BaronBookworm,"September 9, 2018",1,"Was the best until upgraded The latest update is even worse than the last. Takes forever to open and half the time freezes.

This new app is terrible to use & I wish they never changed it! I left the old version on my iPad & still use it as the new one is Horrible, especially the radar screen. The other radar screen was easy to use. The only plus about the new radar screen is it runs much longer to see the storms moving in over a greater length of time. Why change the app when there was nothing wrong with the old version except the incoming storms didn’t show for more than a few hours & ran really fast through incoming weather, and that new feature works correctly when it feels like it! You should have just added that new feature to the radar screen & left the rest of it alone!"
47,Johnnyz53,"July 23, 2019",1,"Let’s go back in Time I own a manufacturing business in the South. Since we work in a mostly open warehouse the weather is very important there was a time when y’all had sections of importance. Videos: At one time the primary videos offered were segments of weather throughout the country. i . e. Northeast, southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and Northwest. Now it’s a melange of Weather top story, then somewhat insignificant stories with background music and subtitles of stories not necessarily pertinent to U.S weather on a daily basis. It seems you have to forage through the pooo to get what your looking for. There was also monthly data that showed averages for one’s area and where we are compared to the average on a rolling average. That’s completely gone. Nowadays it’s the basic local facts and sensationalism. I’m afraid that you don’t know how to get it back.  Lastly, I find it interesting that your posting a 4.6 average when the Lions share of comments are negative. Himmmm Math channel?"
48,Cnizzle516,"December 30, 2019",2,"Prepare for ads and obnoxious Premium pushes for mediocre weather forecasting. This used to be my go-to for weather. Over the last 6 months however, it’s become more and more annoying to use. The ads that integrate themselves into just your home screen are bad enough, but the Premium push is too much. There is no way - NO. WAY. - To predict weather accurately to 10 days. The sensor and satellite technology currently available, as well as predictive algorithms currently in-use, only allow for 5 days maximum, and even then you’re pushing it. Heaven forbid you live in an area that actually experiences rapidly changing inclement weather. The fact that this false claim has turned into a $10/yr service is absurd and disgusting, and suckers people that don’t know anything about what is associated with meteorologists doing their jobs into paying for “upgraded features” that are simply a lie and a guess at absolute best. And now you have to upgrade to premium to see 48 hour future snowfall? Please. Pick another app for your weather if you actually need valid information. I’m deleting this snake oil-esque refuse from my phone."
49,Nikkig127,"June 25, 2019",3,"Good enough The UI is good enough, but I find myself going to the default iPhone app or WeatherBug more often. There’s just too much on the main screen of this app. It’s very busy and difficult to find the essentials at a glance. "
50,Hm1014,"January 28, 2018",3,"Easier navigation needed I wish it was a little easier to navigate and find the information I need quicker. The main thing I go to weather apps is to find out how the weather will be for the day and the week. For first time users easy navigation is the key to get them hooked. As time passes they will begin to explore all the neat tools you offer. It’s seems to me I see the day’s forecast and when I try to look for the week I’m bombarded by these crazy breakdown by the hour and pollen in the air , barometer pressures, and I have to scroll for what seems like a eternity to get out of all these crazy breakdowns for just ONE day! and frankly by that time I’m exausted!! And I leave the app. Accuweather on the other hand has tabs which I LOVE and easy to find at the top of the page. Makes it easy to access the information 90% of the population generally needs. Simple tabs and all the extra info is within those tabs as opposed to spread all over the page and having to scroll on and on to move on to the next thing."
51,Lefty21955,"July 16, 2018",3,"Change of Info Needed I go to this app, because I don’t watch local news and need real time data. I used to watch The Weather Channel, but unless they changed “Your local on the 8’s”, it’s not as helpful as an app might be. As another user mentioned, this app gives too much forecast. It’s rare to have an accurate forecast for today, tomorrow, or the weekend, so why give the outlook for 15 days? What I would like to see is more current and hourly data. Here where I am, humidity is a big issue; a huge issue really. Hourly forecast showing temp AND humidity would be much more useful. The radar would be helpful, if it were easier to load and gave 15 minute intervals for the future cast. The radar for what passed already is really only helpful as far as the path of the weather, so that timeframe probably could be shortened. I like that this app now features “Watson”, because that should be giving better info. Please keep revising this app! I think we all would like it and use it more, if it were improved."
52,Baby Elliebear,"September 1, 2018",1,"Disappointed I used to love this app, because it was easy for my elderly family members to understand and showed what the air pressure was at any given time. Now that they have changed it I am constantly getting calls from family asking what is going on and that they cannot follow it. You should have followed the age old statement. “If it is not broken, do not fix it.” Now you have created an app that is anything but user friendly for anyone and you removed important information like air pressure. I know that as I am writing this it will fall on deaf ears, but if you have older friends or family or know people who are not weather savvy, stay away from this app!!!! I really wish that companies would stop changing things to “keep up with the times”. Leave it alone if you have something good. Now I have to hunt for a different resource and on top of that worry about making sure that it does not have a virus attached. I am really disappointed with the Weather Channel team. I have been watching them since they first aired on television when I was a kid and never thought I would see the day that I would turn away from them."
53,KZink,"October 9, 2018",4,"Local on the 8’s I have loved the weather channel since local on the 8’s. My sister and I would watch as kids to see if we could wear capris in the spring. (Temperature has to be above 65 degrees.)You are still my go to for weather everyday. Your information, radar tracking, and rain alerts are all very helpful. The only reason I give a 4 out of 5 is I’m not a fan of the stark white background. The pictures of the outdoor scenes in the background before this update were quite lovely to open up to in the morning. It made me look forward to getting to know my weather. While the white is clean it just feels cold. The line graph when you open up the app is cool but I find it more informative if the temp numbers were bigger and you could scroll down to see your hourly Temp change rather than clicking through the different sections. Moral of the story coming from a BFA who loves art: bring back the pictures. It makes the people feel good."
54,SexySweetie18,"October 9, 2018",1,"Unreadable Now I used to love the Weather Channel app.  I could do without the ads, but I put up with them.  At least the app offered easy to read information at a glance.  The newest version has inverted the color scheme, made the font small, and made it a lot more difficult to access the weather on an hourly and daily basis.  I miss being able to see my 7 day forecast at a glance.  At the very least, I should be able to see the hourly forecast for the day without clicking around multiple times within the app.  I actually prefer to use the native Apple weather app because it’s more straightforward.  The Weather Channel should give users the option of viewing the app’s content the old way as opposed to claiming that user’s can “just scroll down” for more information.  I also prefer the easily recognizable symbols for fog and wind that used to appear.  I don’t see the new app as an improvement AT ALL.  To the developers: offer other options within the app if you’re unwilling to change it back.  I’ve spoken to other users, and I’m not the only one who no longer wants to use your app after the recent updates."
55,Don Montgomery,"December 23, 2018",1,Why change what work? I had to come back and re-address this!! I noticed some body gave The weather Channel a four star!! If anyone does it’s from the family of the Weather Channel! It’s a fake review from the Weather Channel! Just be honest Weather Channel just fix the problems and quit selling our data!!! Please we all loved you at one time and we need you back in full form and performing as a shining beacon on a lighthouse as our lives and our family lives depends on your performance!

58,Oh My BMW,"January 26, 2020",1,"Just because you can change something, doesn’t mean you should This is definitely not as good as the 2018 Weather Chanel App.  I understand software changes are sometimes needed and maybe these changes were needed to support advertising etc.  But I don’t understand, why they would move from a platform that had great features, to new one that’s a piece of junk.  We were able to see a five day forecast a glance.  And if you wanted a longer forecast, a left/right screen swipe showed five more days of forecast.  And viewing forecast of multiple city was just as easy.  Swipe the screen above the five day forecast and another other city’s forecast popped in.  The old app made good use of a single screen view and a tap or swipe made it easy to navigate to forecasts.  The latest app tends to jump to a detailed daily screen that must be scrolled vertically to read.  It was much easier to scan weather trends horizontally.  I’m moving on to another App, until they recognize and reinstitute the quick great features they abandoned.  Just because you can change something, doesn’t always mean you should change."
59,Old Mtn Man,"August 9, 2019",5,Story My Daughter was driving me home after having a heart cath among other test at Vanderbilt Medical Center. We were driving 300 miles through strong thunderstorms at a very slow speed. We were both having so much trouble seeing that we could not find a exit to get off then interstate. Finally we got lucky and i spotted one in time to get off. We filled the suv with gas plus ourselves with some hot cocoa and coffee. I checked my phone to try and track the storm. I noticed that you stated there was a 22 minute delay between the bands coming in. I told my daughter let’s wait 10 minutes then leave. Thanks to your app we were able to drive the other half at a normal speed. It would have been an extra 5 hrs at the speed we were traveling not counting the danger we were in with all the 18 wheelers flying by us. Plus I needed my heart meds that were at my home
60,Maitlinciller,"April 4, 2018",2,"It'd be so amazing if it didn't exist to glitch I love the video portion of the app where it streams video updates in a number of categories. My favorites would be the lift, science, latest news and viral hits. "
61,Janeinglenellyn,"May 16, 2018",1,"No Change was Needed! I was 110% happy with the previous The Weather Channel app.  The new one takes forever to open, and then the scrolling begins to try to find what I want to know.  Who has the time?  Where are the priorities?  Open to give me today’s temp and rain forecast nearly immediately, as before.  Then, if someone wants to become a part-time meteorologist, let them take the time to explore more.  I am so very disappointed that this is a mandatory upgrade.  We respect The Weather Channel on tv when things get volatile, especially.  But, I am going to have to find a quicker app now.  I hope you didn’t mind spending all the time reading this, just so you could get the full benefit of what was stated in one star and the first sentence.  Perhaps like me, you like quick and concise.  Me, too!  Please bring back the old app.  Then maybe you can simply provide a link for those, who can wait to have more details and photos loaded.  Occasionally, I might enjoy that, too.  But, when I am racing out the door, I just need to know if I need a jacket or an umbrella.  Thanks for understanding the rest of us!"
62,Cskuva,"July 28, 2018",2,"Not accurate, missing features First and foremost, all the bells and whistles in the world don’t make up for the fact that the weather forecasts aren’t usually close.  Except, perhaps, for the temp, weather isn’t in ballpark until one hour before, which isn’t really much of a forecast.  Not sure you can blame global warming for all of this.  Second, if you going to add features, please focus less on videos and cryptic layers on the maps.  (The older version of the app was match easier to figure out.  Please go back to that version.).  Instead, please add humidity percentage and barometric pressure to the hourly page.  With regards to barometric readings, it would be useful to add and up/down arrow to indicate rising or falling pressure, which is far more useful than pressure values alone.  Finally, the app provides a feedback “link”, but this link only takes you to an FAQ page, with no way to actually provide app feedback.  Prior design of app was more useful and accurate.  Just goes to show that you shouldn’t update an app simp,y because you can..."
63,Deborahgem,"October 6, 2018",3,"Update has smaller size type Weather Channel was my go to app for weather for several years.  Just about the same time that I updated it on my phone,  I suffered a bleed into my only good eye.  Wouldn’t you know that at a time when I needed a bigger typeface, the update made it smaller.  Also not only was the type larger in the older version, it was white against a royal blue background which made it much easier to see.  Although my vision is improving, the updated version is still too small for me to read.  I have now switched to another weather app that is much easier for me to see.  Glad that I didn’t update the older Weather Channel version on my iPad!  Do not understand why I can enlarge a word or a page at one website but not at another.  The ability to enlarge the type and icons would be a big help!!  With the population trending older, I would imagine that any app which made their typeface larger and easier to read might attract more users just because of that."

I’m not great with technology, but I was able to quickly move about the old version and find everything I wanted. After months of trying to use this new version I still cannot find the almanac and historical data, the Marine forecast, and many other things I wanted to check on. I have tried through your FAQs but I cannot find the “more” or “almanac” buttons on my screen ANYWHERE to access the additional info. In the previous version this info was all on one screen! It was so easy to flip among the different locations to see what the current weather was where family members live. Now I have to do 2 or 3 movements to achieve the same thing. I have found NOTHING to be better in this new version. You are too worried about adding things like tracking instances of colds and flu that will be so inaccurate as to be worthless. REALLY, how many people will notify you, how many are self-diagnosed! 90% of people I know claimed to have the flu last winter, but only two (out of about 50) were diagnosed by a doctor.

Biggest flaw: You press on radar map, then the forward button expecting to see a prediction of weather path, but instead all radar images disappear tho the timeline continues forward so it looks like it’s a clear sunny day. Same for reverse. Even the still map, the preview shows radar images of heavy storms but when you open radar— there’s nothing. So frustrating. Doesn’t matter if on WiFi or LTE. Several I phone versions, 5- 6- 7- X- XS— same thing. Also, I don’t use this app to see weather footage or commentary on weather or to learn about weather— If I’m using a weather app it’s because I just need fast accurate current weather conditions for where I’m currently located and this app is more concerned about shoving superfluous entertainment in our faces than providing a reliable weather resource.

My only drawback for you users: you may see ads here and there, but do not mind! Just focus on what matters in terms of the weather in your area. And please, do not actually try to go outside and check on what’s happening in the sky; just open this app and it will tell you what you really need to know. Also, you might have to pay extra money to unlock or gain some special features. If you really need to do that, then go right ahead.

Being somewhat dependent on weather I valued local on the 8’s. Unfortunately, local on the 8’s has declined to the point where unless you’re in major metro, you only get regional nonspecific or irrelevant info. Then TWC came out with probably the best weather app. Unfortunately, they simply couldn’t leave well enough alone, and began continually updating/changing the face and functionality of the app for the worse! That’s right, TWC’s IT folks actually and continually began degrading the app a short time after its release. Now they are further degrading themselves and are stripping away features only to turn around and offer to SELL these features back to you! Of course with all these upgrades/changes the app is more unstable and often locks up eventually closing itself out.

Other weather app have really nice designs and sleek looks. But I highly recommend The Weather Channel app because its very well designed, have informal weather videos explaining why we’re getting the bad/good weather, it shows you 15 day predictions which is ok but I don’t really count on weather staying the same for that long, but it’s good to know what the week may look like. I love real rain alert, it has never failed me yet. The weather radar is amazing, shows you how the weather patterns are going to be. You will always be informed with this app."
73,weathergeek48,"September 9, 2018",1,Poor redesign. Harder to read I have been an avid user of the weather channel app for many years and I have to say this latest design is the first one that makes me want to drop it and find another one. The screen is much harder to read now. I can’t look down anymore to get a quick read (which just so you know - is probably a key use of weather apps on your phone!! For most people).  The highlighting of trends- which you advertise is also poor- I do t need to see the obvious wave of temperatures from highs to lows across the days. That is I help to me. 
74,Grandi23,"September 11, 2018",3,"Feedback?  What feedback? This app provides great weather info, free to me, and I can’t blame them for making a buck by showing ads and videos.  If you aren’t interested, just scroll past.  I do have a complaint.  I live in the outside edge of a sprawling city, a couple of miles from an adjacent town, however I cannot set the app to show the weather for the town, instead of the city.  City weather reflects either airport or downtown conditions which are many, many miles from me and not in the same path for storms that may move through.  I can set the town as a favorite, but I have to navigate there and choose it every time I open the app, which is very annoying.  I want to see relevant weather data when I open the app.  I followed the links for Feedback, there is only FAQs and nowhere to submit feedback.  I tried the Support links, same thing, just shows the FAQs.  So for these two reasons I’m giving 5 star weather reporting a meh rating of 3."

It used to be so easy to scroll down to see the current weather, the hourly weather and the 15 day forecast. They were in nice boxes where you could see each day at a glance. You could see the hourly temp, wind direction/speed and humidity all at once for each hour. Now you have to scroll a horizontal grid with a wave in the middle to see the wave rise and fall with the temperatures, etc. and look for what temp that high or low wave represents. You have to touch either temp, humidity or wind to see EACH different “wave” readout 🤦🏼‍♀️ Same for the 14 day readout. Insane!!!!!!! It shows wind speed projected throughout the day but no longer which direction it will come from. It matters to those of us who boat in the Bahamas and off the FL coast. Heck it matters to predict whether or not my house will be blocking the wind at 2PM when I want to sit by my pool. I plan my day early. "

Instead of one click and getting to see the hourly or weekly detail I have to make 2-3 clicks, the radar has changed and is less reliable it looks more like a painting instead of the good radar your app use to have.

In my first review I noted that the app is no longer easy to use, nor is it aesthetically pleasing.  Not that being “aesthetically pleasing” is the most important feature but if it was great before, why change it?  I find the app slow to load now. It is not my phone, or my internet connection. Other apps as well as streaming services load just fine. This app however has major lag. I often wait so long for it to load or to go to the tab I’ve clicked on that I close out of the app before seeing what I went there for. I’ve noticed that the developer is responding to the critical reviews claiming that it can often take time to get used to change. Well, I’ve given it time and I am still not impressed.  The ONLY thing I like are the weather updates I receive throughout the day. Everything else in the app just seems kind of ‘lost’, even after ample time to “get used to it”.

79,OneYungScoot,"January 9, 2020",1,"Disappointed This used to be a great app until they wanted to start profiting more money from it, so they started putting adds. So no big deal still, just slowed down the app itself quite a bit, until they added this “premium” which you have to pay $9.99 a month to used these “special” features that I used to use all the time. So now that all this has been recently added to the app, including the 2-3 times as more adds to the videos, news, and just around the app itself, it is terribly slow, crashes all the time, and can’t use half of the app without the premium which adds up to be $120 a year just to look at what the weather in your area is going to be. Again, this app didn’t use to be like this and was a great and handy tool, but these recent add-on’s has rendered it useless to an average user who doesn’t have the money to pay for premium just to look at the weather in the coming days, which can also be dangerous, but nothing they would care about as long as they’re making more money. Smh, thoroughly disappointed."
80,Kameelean88,"August 30, 2018",5,"You went too far in aesthetics Personally, I thought the videos were interesting, the ads never bothered me because I’m used to ignoring ads completely, and the 15-day forecast was good for planning trips and scheduling future events. Nevertheless, I think the updates on app FUNCTION are successful in making information more accessible. However, changing the entire look of the app wasn’t necessary! Maybe it’s because I’m in the creative field, but I want the blue background back. I was very close to deleting the app because of it. The white background and thin line graphics may make it appear more streamlined or modern, it may give the user a clear message that the app was overhauled, but it also makes it feel like I’m getting... less meat on my plate. I hope the graphics get beefed up a little in the next update."

Scrolling? Freezes. And when it in freezes, you'll accidentally touch one of the many too-big ads, and then  - poof - you're off the app. Gone is the easy ten-day forecast, replaced by a bulky and impossible to read 15-day graphic. I've had TWC since my first iPhone many years ago. I might have to go with a different app until TWC cleans up this current mess."

Some of the minimalism lacks clarity though - so tightening up the UX a little would be good. If you show me a card that says like “Really windy today. See what’s ahead”, tapping on that shouldn’t take me to a temperature forecast - it would take me to a wind forecast. "
83,Ally Tinker,"March 8, 2019",5,"So Helpful I adore this app. I live in the Midwest and weather is often unpredictable and drastic. This app has allowed me to see what the weather will look like hours in advance and has made travels so much safer. Not only can I see what will hit the area I live in, but I can see the whole nation, and anticipate what storms will likely come my way. Also— ten day forecasts! I can plan ahead with ease. I never realized how much easier life was when you knew the weather. I use this app every day and recommend it to all my friends. I have never rated an app on the App Store but I took the time to review this one because of what a quality app it is. It is so user friendly!! Looks good! Can’t believe I ever lived without this app—makes life so much easier. I am 19 and found little to no value in checking the weather, so glad I discovered this app."
84,DFerris123459999,"January 7, 2020",1,"Ads Are Unbearable I have used this app for years upon years and now I can’t scroll once without having five ads pop up somewhere. Ads between days in the daily section. Pay to remove ads? Really? This is an app designed to help the public - not bring forward income. Atleast that’s what I thought. The total vision of this app switched from improving experience to monetary gain. It’s sad to see developers nit picking little nooks to put ads up. Personal opinion, if you’re trying to find information on a severe storm heading your way.. You shouldn’t have to worry about the fifty ads you’re going to be bombarded with and get pushed to pay if you want them gone. Is this a informational application or a children’s game?? What people fail to realize is that an app like this can be someone’s only impression of the company. I don’t watch The Weather Channel anymore, this is all I got. Watching devs push ads and payments into a weather application really gives me - and others a totally bad impression of the company. Instead of being helpful it’s turning into greed. Sad."
85,Dax217,"September 13, 2019",3,Decent app considering it's free. This is a great weather app. It seems to be more superior to the IOS standard weather app. It has allot of info about current weather conditions & it can estimate weather conditions for the next 15 days. The IOS app only predicts up to 10 days & has very limited info in comparison. Its pretty accurate like 90% of the time. If weather conditions change it updates pretty well. I also like how it tells how allergy & cold/flu conditions are.

I kept the old one on my iPad as long as possible while trying to navigate the new one on my phone, for about a year. I don’t know how this app rated 4.6 stars unless they’ve included reviews from the previous version. I noticed a bad review that had 5 stars, must have made a mistake .The old version was GREAT, this new version is Terrible and is full of ads or news which is not what you’re looking for. There are other apps for news. If the developers would pay attention to the recent reviewers, they would know that the old app was easier to get your information immediately as well as other cities,( Why can’t we just swipe anymore?) and navigate in general.  I have tried the new format for a while now and am still unhappy with it so I will be using another weather app which saddens me as I watch TWC regularly and love AMHQ  in the mornings.

Even if there were small issues (bugs and such), it didn’t bother me enough to change my liking of the app.   Since they did this major change, however, I am lucky to check the app a few times a week.   I get that I had a free version, and companies all over rely on ads to support themselves, but the amount of ads in the app now is insane!   In order to open the app, I have to select the app twice.   The first time it closes itself right away.   Then once the app comes up, there’s anywhere from 2-3 ads to close before I even start looking at the info.   Then there’s literally an ad every time there’s a piece of info to show.   You can’t even look at the extended forecast without looking at an ad after every day!!!  I’m also noticing much more bug issues.  Radar works when it wants.   It’s just not worth the time anymore.    VERY disappointed with TWC."

I looked on the App Store to see if there was an update, and there was not. But curiously, there was this same “The Weather Channel” app listed as available for download, as though I didn’t already have it. So I downloaded it. It then installed as a second (duplicate) “The Weather Channel” icon on my screen. I launched it, and it effectively demanded to be able to track me at all times. In order to proceed with opening the app, you had to click “I understand.” Apparently there is a way to go in afterwards and disable that. I didn’t bother. Sleazy. Who needs that crap.  I used this app for years and liked it. Too bad that big IBM, which owns this, has decided to track everyone that it can.  Big data, indeed. I can only imagine what other data they combine with tracking your every movement.  Who knew that Big Brother would materialize in the form of things like weather reports.  We can all be sheep, or we can take small steps to resist. I deleted the app."

Recently, upon opening the app I am faced with at least two advertisements for a premium subscription.

I always check last minute before my kids school bus comes. This new update is EXTREMELY slow to load. I am not exaggerating. When it does load, it's EXTREMELY slow to scroll. I shut off the moving videos. It did help with the scrolling some but not the loading. Also, as others have said, it is quite difficult to navigate. I can not believe they have chosen to make it so user UNfriendly. It's easier to see stories of happenings in other countries than the weather for the day at your house.

Now, the updates are not only annoying, but they’re downright problematic.  Navigating to the info you actually want is a nightmare.  Businesses like these think they’re being tricky to first hook you on their product and then lead you along that now if you want what used to be free and basic you gotta pay or jump through hoops.

95,Nghtowl84,"December 15, 2018",1,Recent update is horrible I used to love the weather app and even paid for it. Since the recent redesign it is frustrating and annoying. I no longer use this app for my weather and wish they’d bring the original design back. The interface was easier to read and see the weather at a glance. Hourly and daily trying to scroll down the screen is annoying and disruptive to the data. Wish I could remember where the radar is now hiding and why does a different screen now pop up when I swipe up from the main page. And when swiped left to check the weather later in the day or week it also moves to a new page if I scroll too far. Why doesn’t it just stop? It’s horrible design. But it’s so nice that they made me pay for another year before they made the update so now I’m stuck with it. And why doesn’t it alert me anymore when my alerts are set for it? Ugh. Frustrated. Why mess with something that worked well. Change isn’t always better when you make it confusing and difficult to navigate.

Until then good bye, I would delete the app but I want to ensure other users can read this prior to downloading. Also feel free to put yourselves back on Fios, you had some really good shows and you were the only real source for up to date weather. But perhaps your decisions makers are purposely alienating both TV and app users in an attempt to put the company out of business. Is it better to have less users or make less revenue off your users, choice is yours. Give the option for the old interface and maps and let the users decide, I don’t even mind if you have ads but give the old interface back.

98,Cocoon79,"August 3, 2019",3,The radar especially needs improved The radar is not accurate like it used to be. It will show that it’s raining exactly where I live but most of the time it won’t be. Then sometimes it will show that rain is headed my way and in approximately 30 minutes it will show there’s none headed my way. My notifications will go off and say expect rain at a certain time and it won’t rain a drop. It’s hard to plan activities throughout the day much less from day to day. This needs majorly improved. The radar has really gotten bad this past year. And it will also show hour for hour rain for example the very next day or for that night so I won’t water my gardens even though they may need it. I check again in a few hours and it’s changed to rain only an hour or so or no rain at all for the next day. I raise a garden and have flower beds so this is also why it’s important to be more accurate for me.

Several times it has said that there was little chance for rain yet suddenly we would be stuck in a downpour. In fact it is happening right now! We bought tickets to an outdoor concert and thought it would be OK based on this app’s forecast but now it looks like the event will be canceled and we will lose the money on our tickets. Thanks a lot Weather Channel! You owe me 60 bucks! Of course the app does update the forecast at the time but that’s useless information when it tells you it’s not going to rain and then it does. My ankle tends to ache when rain is coming so I’m just going to use that as a barometer for what to expect. The degree of accuracy is much better.

If I wanted more detail on each day. I enjoyed option to go to that section myself. Finally, your background gave a more personal feel to the old app. Especially when traveling to different areas of county and checking weather. Now it’s almost plain, a generic version of the previous. The connection is somehow lost. How do you stand out from other weather apps now. Please don’t say it’s because you have graphs and charts.

When I check the weather, I don’t need to spend an hour trying to figure out your graph charts to see if it is going to rain this afternoon. My last gripe is that it is virtually impossible to navigate through all the extra add-on nonsense to find the weather information you are looking for.

It’s the only explanation as to why each update breaks something, removes long-loved features or data, and adds a whole bunch of useless screen fodder. These adolescent developers either don’t bother to test new versions BEFORE adding them to the App Store or are so incompetent they are incapable of getting it right anyway.

However, the weather predictions are consistently, atrociously, unbelievably  inaccurate. Specifically, while the temperatures and winds for the short term - one to two days - are reasonably accurate, the forecasts of cloud cover, rain, and frequently frontal passages are unbelievably poor. It is common, usual even, for the daily weather forecasts to change dramatically overnight; for example, form a predicted 80+% chance of rain with cloudy skies to 10% rain chance with scattered clouds or clear skies. Any idiot could in the morning peer out the window and make as accurate a forecast for the day as does this app...and likely without making a stupidly contrarian forecast the evening before. It seems the predictive performance of this app degraded dramatically when IBM purchased The Weather Channel and employed Watson to generate the forecasts.

The app is frequently down. By down I mean that the user is frequently confronted with a blank blue screen. Or the user must contend with an app that suddenly crashes when an initial choice is made upon user input as to what weather info is initially selected upon opening the app; sometimes it crashes upon opening the app. Another criticism is that, when selecting the area that one is looking for data on, they are only allowed to choose the city or “metropolitan area.”  Weather Underground is a less ambitious app that delivers info about specific zip codes, even individual reporting sites in a given area. This app is sadly lacking what seems to be this common sensical way of weather reporting. A large metropolitan area can have several types of weather occurring simultaneously.

I live in the northeast and 2018 has given us the most unpredictable weather in recent memory. I’ve used and relied on this app more this year than ever before. I just need the info. I don’t care about “style” or how pretty it’s presented, which seemed to be the developers only concern... and they did a bad job. It doesn’t flow at all. Deleting today."
122,tharp76,"September 3, 2018",1,"Newest version is awful The most recent app update, sometime in the end of August 2018, has ruined the app. I used to be able to open the app and get a straightforward weather forecast. Now, the app is bogged down with useless graphs and information and I’m forced to toggle back-and-forth between forecast options. I don’t understand what is so difficult about being able to open an app and see what the temperature is and see what the temperature and precipitation forecast will be for the next week. No one wants some reimagined app that is mostly useless information, they want to be able open app look at the temperature and plan their day or week accordingly. People want user friendly and fast information, the app could be a blank white screen with the temperature in black and the temperature for the next “X” number of days underneath it in black and I bet people would find it leagues better than what it is now. It looks like I will be forced to get my Weather information elsewhere"
123,WreckEmTech2009,"September 6, 2018",1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR $0.00 I have had this app since it was developed, and it gets exponentially worse with every “upgrade.” On a good day it functions about 10% of the time, and even then does not function well at all. It constantly crashes, the map/radar glitches most of the time and they seem to spend way more time uploading useless videos that have absolutely nothing to do with my local weather (the ONLY reason to use this app in the first place) or anything that will impact it. I have this app on an iPad 5th generation, iPad Mini and iPhone 8+, and the experience is the same across the board - HORRIBLE! I was only motivated to take the time to write this review because I am sitting with several others outside listening to the rain and we all began discussing how bad the experience is with this app each and every time we try to use it. Please spend some time and resources focusing on the development of LOCAL information like forecasts and radars that are reliable, accurate and most of all FUNCTIONAL!"

None of those things happened in your latest update, and you made it virtually impossible to find any meaningful information."
125,Fofiluna,"January 12, 2019",1,New Interface Never Loads I have relied on the weather channel apps for weather since I got my first iPhone 3g. I pay the subscription fee to not deal with commercials. Which by the way was initially a lifetime buy and changed to yearly. Since this new interface update 90% of the time the app won’t load past the blue flash screen and spinning circle. I have an iPhone X and my iOS is up to date. I have sent several notifications into their help center and after months the issue is still not fixed. Thank god I never deleted the old weather maxx app off my phone. It still loads EVERY time I open it. But it ticks me off that I am paying for a basically useless subscription. Also the Watch app was buggy to start with and now hasn’t worked or loaded the weather in months. I resorted to Carrot weather for my watch. Frustrated as a long time customer they can’t squash this bug and that they released this change without really having it ready or thinking of their audience.
126,Blue Canyon Ralph,"May 31, 2019",3,"Snow Forecasts Useless Some time back this app had a location for Blue Canyon CA, which is very close to our elevation, and seemed to be reasonably accurate.

UNTIL the most recent borderline-belligerent full-screen pop up adds pushing me towards the premium (subscription) version. It’s one thing to see adds; it’s a whole other thing to be assaulted by them in full-screen fashion when you’re just trying to check the weather. I would have gladly paid a one-time fee for this app. Frankly, I love it and it’s worked well, though frequently plagued by bugs and issues. What I won’t do is 1) pay a monthly/yearly fee for weather or 2) deal with the full-screen adds. I know weather is in your name, but let’s face it - it’s a weather app, and I can get weather updates almost anywhere. Anyway, I’ve reached a point of frustration with the never-ending full court press for my subscription money and I’ve moved on. App deleted. Goodbye, Weather Channel.

But seriously this app is completely useless and it seems to be getting worse. I’ve been trying to use it almost daily since the recent storm season and it’s yet to provide me accurate information. - oh it’s going to rain in the afternoon, let’s get all my yard work done early, I walk outside at 8am and it starts pouring! Another true story; I’m caught in a major FL downpour and I pull out this app to take a look at the radar and see when it’s going to pass, well the radar says it’s currently high and dry in my area, not a rain cloud in sight. I look outside the window and we are having a monsoon in the yard....this app is just garbage with inaccurate information. I suppose if you like scrolling through a bunch of poorly targeted ads then this app may be for you but if you’re looking for an app to help you with the weather then you’re better off just looking out the window."

It annoyed me when they started to hound you with more and more ads, but it wasn’t that big of a deal. And then they did their last update. Not only do the ads seem worse, but the “icing on the cake” is they changed the interface to the point I can’t stand it anymore. I loved the way the weekly forecast used to be and was the feature I used ALL THE TIME. It was smart and simple. Now instead of being able to scroll through the whole week you get the one day and then have to hit a tab at the top to go to the next day. It sounds trivial, but it has completely ruined my experience with this app. Goodbye Weather Channel."

For the life of me I can’t understand why in the world TWC keeps changing the app!!! It gets worse with each “upgrade”. This one takes the cake though. The high/low wave is annoying. Trying to look ahead at the forecast and following the high/low wave is not helpful at all. It isn’t as easy to skim to the date you want (although future forecasts have never been accurate anyway). I use this app daily and I think this time I’m done. There are plenty of other apps out there that do the same job, are more accurate, and don’t surprise you every so often with a completely new layout to figure out. Dear Weather Channel, go back! Go back to the basics! Simplify! Just provide the weather! We don’t need you to be trendy or hip, just accurate. Please go back to one of your original versions and tweak it. STOP changing it completely. The wheel doesn’t need to be reinvented every couple months."

Plus really white background not liking it at all. I will be looking some with less video, more weather as well no bugs. I am not why you needed to change an app that was working and I could read!!! Disappointed your changes are disappointing!!! Iam deleting this if it get fix and an option to go to prior update I will come back but not until then. I believe the weather channel should seriously pay attention to the user. Our videos are not what people want to see when using the app. Weather, accuracy, radar and current at the moment weather patterns. Your pollen counts are great as well colds and allergy weather. But this last update just totally ruined your app please think of the comments left. Read them and respond. Your ignoring the app problem."

After this latest Sept 2018 update (and total redesign), I have now deleted it. The “old” layout was much easier to read, follow, faster to get a glance at the current weather, as well as the days ahead. Why try to fix what ain’t broken?? There are too many extra “taps” and added “swipes” needed, not to mention longer navigating, just to get to the 10 day outlook. The added graphs and small text is too distracting. With this redesign, I can no longer just do a quick glance at the day’s weather and the 10 day. In the iPhone world, adding unnecessary taps and swipes is a quick way to get a user to delete an app. I can’t believe it, but I’m back to just using the default iPhone weather app.. yea, the redesigned weather channel app is THAT bad :( And I won’t even get into the video ADS.. every video must make you watch a 15 sec advertisement.. no matter how many videos you watch.

Sometime in the last year or two they decided to update the app and totally disregard the fact I already paid for their upgraded version. But instead now I need to pay a COMPLETELY unreasonable monthly rate for features that are simply not worth it. The fact they can’t grandfather in previous upgrade options they offered in the past is the only red flag I needed to figure out that this app had become a money grabbing business instead of a helpful tool that helps businesses, outdoor enthusiast etc. So hear my warning: unless you want a weather app that lags, has more advertisement then weather information and doesn’t stand behind their previous purchases, then don’t get this app. Based off all the 1 start reviews, I’m not the only one who feels this way. Extremely disappointing to see."

Because of my iPads age, I purchased a new one & installed what I thought was the same app I previously used. I have spent too much time trying to use this updated version & have little interest in learning. The older version was clear, easy to navigate & set up weather destinations, as well as switch from one area of the old app to another. The large weekly forecast squares made it easy to view basic daily weather & with a quick tap, reveal the more detailed weather for the day. I am truly disappointed & need to find a better alternative. In reading the other reviews, I can clearly see the dissatisfaction of so many others. This might be a good time to rethink this new model & return to a format that was clearly liked by most. The 1 star rating exists only because one can’t submit a review without tapping at least 1 star. I would have preferred zero."

Meanwhile ads are still popping up all over.  Other than that, I like the app and have been using it for years.  I am getting used to the new format, but I do like the old version better. It is more complicated and busy than in the past.  I do understand about the need to make money to cover operating costs and make a profit, so a subscription service makes sense. However, if you receive payment for a product or service, you need to deliver it. "

Chief among them is the fact that I live and work in two different places, so when I wake up in the morning, I want to be able to assess the weather in both. I also like to check in on the weather where my daughter is at college, and where my mother lives on the opposite coast from me. In the old version of the app, I could just swipe left to go from place to place/info to info. Now it’s a lot more complicated to get that information. Also, with all the extras added in, getting the information on just one place to load takes a bit longer than it did before when the first screen was just the current temp/highs and lows."

The previous version was just a long scroll through of everything on the web page. The new version comes with a quick view of the weather and buttons on the bottom of the screen to quickly access hourly and daily weather as well as radar. I hated having to scroll through a lot of data I wasn’t interested in to get down to the radar. The app still has those other features such as air quality, videos and news but much easier and faster to flip through each item with one flick on the screen rather than infinite scroll. Much more user-friendly interface. Well done Weather Channel."

144,Tubaguy67,"September 16, 2018",1,"Giving up on all things Weather Channel I’ve been frustrated for years about how the Weather Channel (WC) has done their best to make weather stories seem worse than they actually are to support the global warming theory (yes, I believe the planet is getting warmer, but the fossil and geologic records shows periodic fluctuations in climate and global temperatures and warmer times in our planet’s history even before humans existed, so how much current warming is due to natural causes?), and by making things seem worse than they are by telling us how many million people will be affected by the pending weather events. It’s simply looking at the population of the area. Most people are not going to die in these situations. Now I see a WC reporter “barely able to stand” in the face of Hurricane Florence’s winds while two guys casually stroll by in the background. I cannot depend on any WC product - tv, web, or phone app - to give me accurate information that isn’t colored by political agenda. Too bad. I used to like the WC a lot."

Why would you make it harder to see the weather at a glance?!   I have to squint to see the high and low for just one day, and can’t distinguish the tiny grey cloud from the tiny rain drop under the grey cloud or the tiny sunshine over the grey cloud.  With this redesign, I have to spend LONGER time on an app that I need FAST info a couple times a day.  Oh and why does my app continuously show a notification symbol?   I can’t open my phone without the notification icon appearing as it’s always on, but there aren’t any messages I can see when I open the app. I close the app and it goes away so apparently Ymir thinks I’ve been notified but not sure what the alert was.

I want weather, not more fake news (and this is coming from an Earth and Atmospheric Science minor). Just because some left wing professor makes a claim the world is ending, doesn’t mean we all have to believe him. People need to open up their eyes and look overseas if they really want to solve pollution issues. We are a first world county with great technology, and it’s not the U.S. we need to worry about. Even then, if we would stop all fossil fuels today, it would take 50 years for greenhouse gas levels to stop rising. So if anyone actually believes in the idea that the earth is going to be uninhabitable in 12 years, then making any political statements about changing anything now would be a waste of time.

An easy fix would be to select the page you want when opening up the app. Second fix would be to be able to customize what you want at the top. I don't want to scroll down through videos and other sections just to get to the forecast and radar. I use the app rarely always hoping that the change the interface with updates.

This is not even news. Quit adding shocking headlines that are upsetting to your WEATHER app. I’ve deleted this app multiple times for this reason and I’m doing it again until this is fixed. I doubt everyone who uses your app enjoys hearing about things dying when they’re trying to check the temperature. You could at least add an option to not see these features.

There’s nothing wrong with making a new app but it shouldn’t be harder to read and less intuitive than the old one. I used to have everything I needed at the top of the main page to get a quick, at a glance look at the weather. If I wanted details I could scroll down and look at hourly or extended daily. Now if I want the same stuff I used to get at a glance I have to tap details and then the contrast and font sizing is just terrible. Give me the old way back, let me see it fast, and easy to read.

There is no way to get in touch with the developers to tell them they should leave well enough alone or make the writing thicker. If this isn’t fixed I’m going to find a different app.  I am not going to keep an app that I can’t see. I can’t imagine how people with real eye problems can use this app any longer.

With hopes this would go away, as if today, my wonderful app has now gone to a glorious ad king pin and it’s ridiculous. This is a national TV station that has its own app. When I want weather reports. I still tune in to TWC on TV, but this app requirement to either pay .99 or $3.99 to be ad free is utterly ridiculous. It has been going strong for years for me without this payment. I will now find something else, because this is ridiculous. It’s just the weather, I’m not paying for that.

All that stuff on the screen leaves little room to see a viewable map area. And all of a sudden that fat radar progress bar no longer displays “future”, “past” or the time progression. My husband has this same app, but even tho we live in the same spot, his info is always different (daily, hourly temp info). This app is just ridiculous.

It happens the opposite way as well.  I don’t take my bike because they say it will rain all morning and ends up sunny and clear. ALSO... Why on earth does it have a TWO WEEK forecast?  I try to plan my trips ahead of time and the forecast is worthless.  I already cancelled my weekend plans for Oct 12 because they said it was going to rain all weekend but slowly it looks like it will be nice.

Bizarrely, the iPhone version's main screen only shows current conditions and the brief forecast, without the useful menu bar (forcing users to scroll down to find this information).

Now that I have an IPhone 10 the app crashes every time I try to open it.  On the second attempt it will open, but it still crashes occasionally even then.  I don’t like the 10 day forecast going left to right across the top of the screen.  Going down would be more user friendly and allow you to see more days without scrolling.   In addition. The radar app has the future/past control practically in the middle of the radar and makes it difficult to stretch or pinch the radar without hitting the future or last.  Again annoying.  FYI. I’m using version 10.3."
163,gscottshaw,"February 13, 2019",1,"Unusable So frustrating to use this app now. I used to prefer it over the default Apple weather app because the interface was clean and concise and easy to see everything at-a-glance. Now their fancy UI designers have made it take five times as many steps to do what it could do before. What a waste of screen real estate. It used to be easy to skim the weather for the hour or the day or the week as it would change. Now things move horizontally left to right with multiple digits above and below instead of top to bottom, up and down which is way more natural to take in information. None of my saved weather locations seem to stay and I periodically have to keep removing ads because the app forgets that I paid to remove them. Please fix this experience. I’m switching back to the default Apple weather app for my home screen and will only open this app for the radar when we’re expecting rain or snow. So disappointing."
164,Irish_Dance8123,"March 4, 2019",5,"Very useful and precise!!! Great app and very accurate! It can show you the weather for the next 2 weeks! I check it everyday, because the weather can change in a matter of seconds. If there is a quick change in weather, they are right on top of the app to update it! It doesn’t just show you the weather, it can show you the how likely it is to get sick in your area. It’s more accurate then any other weather app because the weather is always what it says. You can check on the app to see how many inches you’ve gotten of snow or rain, and it can show you a video of the future to see what’s coming. There is no doubt that this is the absolute best weather app! Get it in your App Store today!!!!"

167,Enna689,"October 16, 2019",2,"Apple should go back to using yahoo weather It was a mistake for Apple to rely on the inaccuracy of the Weather Channel when Yahoo is more accurate with its annual weather reports due to its combination of technology provided by the weather satellite that Yahoo uses to get its detailed of accuracy. The Weather Channel despite its claim of getting its sources from their satellite, their result is often inaccurate. The other sources of inaccurate weather reporting because they constantly change the information so the result is inclusive. Yahoo is the only browser that prides on their record of accuracy while others don’t come close. Also Yahoo uses the data provided by observing previous weather activities and that’s often how it usually works. Changes in weather patterns on the Western United States often are slow and abrupt, so it’s pretty difficult to know what next year’s weather will be."
168,Killer3980,"December 16, 2019",1,Angry Ever since yous asked for money for the weather your weather has been wrong almost everyday. It started in the summer. I would see no rain take the family out on boat. Next thing I know it’s raining. You are putting our us and our family’s lives at jeopardy. I know something is going on.  Just because of that change I will not pay. Your weather prediction is totally wrong more than 60% of the time. Weather channel shows one thing on tv and another on the app. This Saturday said no rain so I went hunting well it rained all day. Again putting myself in unsafe conditions. You think people are stupid. The app goes form always being rite to always being wrong. If anything it should get better. Because you are putting my family in unsafe conditions I will not pay you. I actually thought about paying. Now I say why pay for something that is always wrong. What a joke. Yous are gonna really hurt someone one day. Weather is free.

I got this app because that Friday was a terrible storm, I was alone with my boyfriends little brothers, the power went out and my window started leaking tons of water from the rain. It told us there was a tornado warning and to take cover, I had to bring my birds inside from my lanai, sure enough there was a close touch down near my house! Thank god I brought the babies in.

All that seems to happen is updating the weather as it’s happening at that moment. That is the only time this app is right. It changes multiple times a day, and even when updated, the app is not correct. It feels like whoever is in charge of this app, is not even trying anymore. It’s actually been pretty entertaining watching the guessing game that happens. It seems most weather apps are pretty much an absolute dumpster fire anymore. Avoid the app unless you just want a very generalized weather update. Or you can text me, and I’ll just walk outside and check it out and let you know what is happening at that moment, and then give you my best guess of what’s gonna happen in the next few days. If anyone out there is looking to start an app, start a weather app, cause the way things are, anyone can predict the weather as good as these guys can."

I used to allow notices in the background, but after the last two updates my battery on my IXS-which is outstanding plummeted.  I looked at usage and the weather app accessed my phone 142 times in less than 2 days...142 times...I mean get real and fix the logic as an update shouldn’t cause that.  So now it’s only allowed when I access it, and when done I remove it from static memory. My batter improved immediately like it used to.  It will take some time before I even test it in the background since both STORM radar and WU provide updates with reasonable logic-not 142 times in 1.5 days...you are a premier company and shouldn’t even allow this to exist without testing it first.

I would like to see them incorporate a way to have a choice of how the app looks. I would choose the way it looked before they did the update. Since the update I have been using other apps and only check the weather periodically. Before the update, I check the weather multiple times a day due to the type of business we are in. I think the update made it difficult to see and to navigate through so I gave it a one star review. I’m very disappointed with the new update!

Yes, you can still find the same information, but it is harder to access. I’m not a fan of the wavy lines (data graphs); they are annoying and not very useful.

I do not want to know the breaking news, I would like my notification settings to stay so I know if there is a tornado warning. I had a panic attack because my dad told me that there is a tornado and I had no idea. Could’ve died and wouldn’t have known why.

I’d like to give 5 stars, but for the continuous ads that draw your attention away. I’ve tried hitting the close button to extinguish the existing ad, but they just keep coming back! WTH! Can’t you guys/girls just get rid of the ads altogether? Maybe create an ad-free paid version (preferably a $.99 version)? Also one reviewer had the right idea: more words! And include a permanent ‘Rain’ indicator/section. I shouldn’t have to use two apps to verify if rain is imminent or even snow (inclement weather). I’m pretty certain that people use the app for weather and not for online shopping. Besides, your screen pics don’t even show the ads, so no one expects them when they download the app."

This app isn’t simplistic but instead complicated once you get the hang of it is a actually good useable app. People says there’s a ridiculous amount of ads but i don’t understand it. Been using the app for years and there’s always been ads. But not a ridiculous amount of them. Although they have a video section and you have to watch a 10 second ad to access it, is isn’t really a big deal, considering some other weather apps have way more,plus you don’t even have to use this video feature.

It reminds me of that awful time they tried to integrate twitter in its first section. Stop putting so much in the app; put the videos and series in a separate section or page, or even put links to send you to safari. I use the app for the weather.

It would be nice to be able to swipe between different locations like in the last app.  I hate that the layout is meant for a phone or holding your iPad vertically—when used horizontally the information is in a narrow column wasting space on both sides.

Anyone who lives anywhere that regularly experiences humidity levels ranging from 70%-100% knows how necessary this information is, yet the people working on The Weather Channel’s app are clueless about the effects of humidity???  It is absolutely IMPERATIVE to include humidity information because it is the difference between “comfortable weather, let’s open all the windows!” and “oh my God turn on the air conditioning!!!”  High humidity turns beautiful sleeping weather into sticky awfulness, and makes 60 degrees feel more like 80 degrees (all temperatures in my review are in Fahrenheit).

I waited 3 weeks for another update hoping you would have come to your senses... much to my disappointment that horrid crappy white background with the ridiculous graph was still there.

206,the other one,"September 21, 2018",1,"Latest version - v10 I think Oh my god. Question - did the people who redesigned your app ever use it? Or, even look at the hunk of junk you just pushed out into the world? Fire the designers or get your money back some how, this is just god awful. It's not that it's people being ""confused by a new layout"", it's that you took an otherwise good app and made it unuable and utterly useless. It's like some wannabe slick agency just bamboozled you and took you for a serious ride. I almost feel sorry for you.  This was my favorite weather app for years and years. The fact that someone (probably several people) looked at the plans for this app and signed off on it thinking it was somehow an improvement, makes me want nothing to do with Weather Channel ever again. After many years of near daily use, I deleted the app and will never look back. Roll back or cut your losses and compelety start over, there's nothing to salvage here"
207,phirehazard,"October 24, 2018",1,Update Ruined it I hate the total redesign. Here’s three reasons why:
208,XRENIHANX,"April 17, 2019",2,"It used to be so much better! I don’t like how the app reverts back to the current location after you leave the app, even for just one second. It also takes longer to load than before. When you initially open the app and attempt to scroll down to see more info, the Videos section pops up with several ads. The “Your Daily Weather Snapshot” takes too long to load for it to be worth the wait. I have an average bandwidth of 140Mbps so it’s not the connection speed that’s causing this. Also, when  you click on the video part of the app, it doesn’t show current weather forecasts first, but random video footage. I don’t typically click the video button to see random weather footage of places outside my locale. I think the designers missed the mark when they overhauled the app. It wasn’t broke before, so why was it “fixed?”"
209,Mystique0131,"July 29, 2019",2,"Locations and Alert Settings Disappear I have been using TWC app as my default weather app for as long as I can remember. I have lived through the changes to the app that have occurred over the years. But the as annoying as some changes may have been,  TWC has always had the most reliable app for my area.  That has changed recently. I woke up this morning to all my saved locations being wiped, and all my alert settings being turned off. This is the second time in a month. The last time this happened, we were on vacation in the Midwest, and encountered severe weather. I was completely let down by this app, not receiving one of the severe alerts for the area we were in. Out of all the things that can go wrong, this is the worst possible scenario. I’ll have to go with another service, at least until storm season is over."
210,dpd45p,"February 19, 2018",3,"Amazing graphics & layout but poor current conditions I’ve tried a number of these weather apps and unfortunately, this one seems to be the best of the worst.  Graphics and information displayed are logical and well organized.  Radar is decent and although there is a slight delay it is very detailed.  The main problem with all of these apps is that they rely on delayed & inaccurate forecasts.  Ex. The alert notifications for rain or snow (“Snow starting in 30 min”) are based on what was previously forecasted and not on current conditions.  In fact they are so inaccurate that they are really just a hindrance & should just be disabled.  Considering the Weather Channel is nothing more than “entertainment” media, the fact that this app is as accurate as it is should be considered par for the course."
211,Gcap1,"March 20, 2018",1,"How about our weather? Maybe The Weather Channel has forgotten that weather is happening all over the country and not just the East. Here we have a series of storms hitting us that have a very considerable amount of rainfall and if I want information more than a casual mention, I have to look at Accuweather and other weather apps. News flash TWC... I live in California!! Stop running the Nor Easter into the ground and cover other areas! My app is 100% crap about things going on thousands of miles from me.  It one mention of our weather. How about spending some thought on your app and gearing the news feed for the region you are in when using the app? If I in California want to see what’s going on in the East, I should have to search that up!  Of search relentlessly to find out what is going on around me! Poor implementation of your app in my opinion. I’ll stick with the apps that understand I care first about my weather."
212,chombito,"September 1, 2018",4,"Much improved! Finally I must say that this finally is a decent app. It’s reaching its potential. I love the new interface; much cleaner, informative and easy to look at. Glitches need to be iron out and more features should be included. Would like to see access to historical data and more in depth articles about weather, climate change, and other scientific related weather phenomena. There is so much data and amazing information available that it should be made more readily available. Information is knowledge. Don’t focus so much on video, but rather go for meaningful content. Don’t get me wrong, immediate weather information should be front and center, but there is more potential to make this a great app that might be worth paying for."
213,The one MJ,"September 3, 2018",5,"The weekly snapshot is gone! Horrible “update” The 2-week snapshot view was one of the best features of the old app, but they’ve completely removed it in the newest version. We’re now forced into hourly and daily view options, and while the latter shows data the previous weekly snapshot provided, you’ll be forced to scroll through every day’s details to get an understanding for how your week will unfold weather-wise. For business travelers and vacationers (among others) who determine their attire or plan their activities based on weather in advance, the removal of the weekly snapshot is a deal breaker. As a result, I’m now using another weather app. What a ridiculous, colossal design mistake."
214,DuoHiro,"September 7, 2018",3,"Why? Why did you have to fix what wasn’t broke? You’ve made the daily forecast annoying, what was wrong with just listing the high and the low with possible precipitation, not this stupid curvy line that takes up way to much room. Now I only see three days at a time instead of five. And if you are gonna give us pages to flip through at least let us decide which ones we want to see and in what order. And bring back the swipe right that brought up other locations you had saved. It was annoying when you got rid of it in the first place. Why save locations if you just have to go searching for them again. "
215,Bbcregular,"September 11, 2018",2,"Now a totally different app Change for the sake of change is not a good idea. An update is one thing, but to scrap/trash what was working for a completely different format without an instruction video or written instructions is just ridiculous! I have waited to write this review to see if I could view the weather as before. It is impossible. I travel and liked the future forecast. Why that feature is hidden, I do not know. I can find the future forecast in other areas after many mistakes. I still have not found on how to find it directly. Previous app I just scrolled down. Now I make no less than four go here now go here. What basement idiot came up with this and worse who approved such a fiasco. I will be looking for a different weather app. Be sure to tell the people that advertise on your app that many people will not be seeing their ads."

217,KaraInKentucky,"November 26, 2018",1,"Horrible! Worst app I’ve ever used!! Have had this for years because I need it.  But I always dread turning it on. It takes forever to open (too much unnecessary junk included), I can’t figure out what I’m looking at because there is way too much going on, and as soon as I figure out the constantly new formats - it changes!! I preferred the much older, simpler version. This new stuff is waaaaay more complex than I need my weather report to be! "
218,Thingsyourollup,"April 24, 2020",1,"Hate the Videos TWC always ignores the Phoenix area in its videos that are actually about weather, and when it finally shows one on the main screen talking about the Southwest, and I “tap for sound” it just loads the video player screen, plays a 40 second ad that I can’t skip and could care less about, then instead plays some video about storms in the east and the original video I wanted to watch wasn’t even there.  I hate the new video player. Used to be able to skip ads by just scrolling to the next video and then scrolling back but now you have to suffer through ads that are even more annoying and longer than before.  I don’t usually watch videos on this app anyway since 90% of them are mindless click bait videos that don’t even have anything at all to do with weather, but when I actually see one I want to watch I at least want to be able to watch it."
219,EileenSt,"October 22, 2019",3,"Radar issues Something my husband and I have noticed with the radar is it’s seeming inaccuracy. Last night, when we were on the road to our grandsons’s baseball game an hour away, I checked the radar as the sky looked very dark in the direction of his field. No rain at all showed on the radar but seconds later, our daughter called to tell us the game was canceled due to rain! Right after that, we ended up in a deluge which slowed all interstate traffic to a crawl yet on the radar, the only rain being down was way to our north! Supposedly, we were in the clear. What’s up with that??? My husband does lawn and landscaping work and depends on the radar yet lately, it has been undependable. He’s beginning to wonder if this is a Weather Channel “plot” to force users to buy their premium services. 😉"
220,Zamba0207,"February 23, 2018",4,"Love weather, and the app! ;D I give 4/5 because lately, after this recent update, it keeps crashing on me. I try to open it and it closes. I’ve even tried restarting it and my phone but still it crashes. I still get notifications which, by the way, I love! Tells me when it’s about to start raining, snowing etc. Anyways, other than that it’s a great app. I like looking at the radar. It’s not laggy at all for me. The future and current radar is fantastic. Again I like how you can get notifications about when it’ll rain or snow and the like. I also like the videos and trending news feature it has as well! I like showing my husband and friends some crazy videos, weather related, that’s going on :D"
221,Lilred924,"August 29, 2018",2,"Used to love this app but updates destroyed it This app was updated last night and I absolutely hate the updates.  I have used this app for years, I literally look at it several times a day to monitor the barometric pressure, plan trips, prepare for my day etc.  It was clear and easy to figure out seeing today, five days, up to two weeks and the radar was in two places that really helped when tracking storms.  NOW, it doesn’t show the barometric pressure AT ALL, which to me is key to sinus pressure and the primary reason I look at it daily.  The new split up little screens are obnoxious.  If something wasn’t broken, why fix it??  PLEASE change it back!  I am so sorry this is set up for automatic updates!  The reason I gave it two stars is for the last few years that I loved it, if it was based on just today it would be 1 Star.  So disappointed."
222,RLJRLJRLJRLJ12345,"September 7, 2018",3,"This app is okay I have had this app for over a year, I learned about it while I was running track due to a lot of parents having it. I love how the app lets me know where the storm is, how it will go past me in the following hours and how serve the storm is. On the downside I’ve noticed that sometimes the predictions are wrong but then again I live in an unpredictable City & all weather predictions will never be 100% correct I still feel like I always get something different from Apple weather, this weather all & the weather channel on tv. I also hate how one minute it says it’s going to storm all day and then another it says the storm has passed and it'd be clear. In conclusion I feel that this app should be updated and a lot more accurate so it could actually benefit people."
223,Nokka61,"January 28, 2019",3,"Good app with an issue I like the app but one important issue is this. The color of the font on the Alerts page is too light against the white background.

It may help if I could switch to night view but that’s not available either. "
224,GirlScienceNerd,"February 4, 2019",4,"I used to like it more, but it has become increasingly annoying. The annoyance isn’t because of ads: I now have to click multiple times to find the information that used to be front page. For example, it used to be when you clicked on the hourly forecast, the expected weather conditions for wind and precipitation would show up along with temperature in a vertically scrolled screen. Now there’s a horizontal screen with the only useful prediction being the temperature. To get to the original vertical screen, you have to click again. Clicking twice isn’t a big deal, necessarily, but it is annoying, and I have enough annoyance in my life. There are other weather apps and I’m exploring the possibilities."

Also, my notification settings changed so I received notifications I did not ask for. The relevant information I need such as the “today’s details” are below “breaking news” and “videos.” It takes 30 seconds just to find out the wind speed or humidity. This app makes me think the developer doesn’t care about the weather and more about money and clicks. How can I trust weather when all they care about is money. This is unsafe when weather is important. It shouldn’t cost money to look at the weather."

Not past weather, not videos of the weather in places I’m not at, not cute little news stories, or anything else irrelevant to the daily weather.  I just want to be able to plan my day, and maybe my week.  It’s almost as bad as the weather channel itself where it’s hard to actually get the weather for the day through all the unnecessary crap.  PLEASE just give the weather for my area with the option to see weather for other places I might be going to.  If the weather app would go back to showing the weather I’d buy this app.  I pay for useful, well made, apps all the time.

227,Kuane,"October 22, 2019",2,"Doesn’t make sense Why in the world would you be dumb enough to pay a monthly fee when you can get excellence somewhere else!? Listen, there are free apps that do great weather reporting, or you can pay a ONE-TIME cost to get a top-rated weather app. I know this is the free version, but it seems to me they have significantly cut off much of what was once free to try to get you to pay a MONTHLY FEE for their PRO version. They also slyly don’t show “in-app upgrades” because they worked their sneaky way around the “in-app” by technically not being an in-app upgrade. They just cut back in their services and pop an ad up when you open the app to BUY their “Pro” version. One of the very top-rated apps is Dark Sky. $3.99 one time cost. It is amazing! Add a radar app for free. I use Radar USA. Then you are set with excellence, safely covered for all sorts of weather. Be smart and safe!"
228,Mirage6,"September 26, 2019",1,App won’t load since last update Slow to load and if I leave the app and open it immediately it resets to my current location again.  Which just make it all the slower since you need to wait for it to load and then navigate back to where you were before.  And the new pop up trying to get you to subscribe all the time is fun too because you get to wait for that to load so that you can just close it.

232,Reginalynne,"September 1, 2018",2,"With each new   “improvement” With each new “improvement” you have managed to scatter data all over several pages with charts and graphs and no way to save settings such as “daily” instead of the default “hourly”.  Its the same with the radar page. Your default settings override the particular ones I prefer, even while I am using the app.  I don’t need to see hourly temperatures; I want to see daily information. And I don’t want to have to tell the app that every time I change from one city to the next and back again.   I want to see a radar screen with clouds and rain every time I log on.  I shouldn’t have to set that up every time.  And I did not have to before these last two upgrades.  Bring back the user friendly app that saves my preferences and presents a concise, easy to read page of information."

Useful features like rain alerts and lightning strikes near me were now behind a paywall with more features being moved behind the paywall with each new update. The app started to alert me about major weather events that were half a world away even after changing setting in the app to prevent those type of notices. After the latest update, they’ve increased the amount of banner adds to the point that the app runs poorly and stutter. Regretfully I’m now looking for a new weather app. I can respect the developer looking for revenue for their work, but moving previous features behind a paywall and turning the app into something that you scroll through adds just to get the weather is a bit much."
235,linn8357,"October 14, 2019",1,"Unreliable This was once a great app but now it seems like it’s nothing but a guessing game to them. More like it’s a computer just putting something out there rather it’s true or not. It’s so unreliable that you can’t trust the app from hour to hour when it comes to rain or temperature. It can say 100 percent rain for 4pm and all you will see is sunshine. It says you will get 4 inches of rain and not even get a tenth of an inch.   Even the radar changes within minutes because it can’t predict where a storm is going. It can say a storm is headed straight towards you and be an hour away from you. Literally, it can’t predict anything within minutes. I don’t recommend this app anymore but I do recommend accuweather. They at least give you a better idea of what’s going or whats coming to you and their rain percentage is pretty accurate. Only good thing about this app is the videos nothing more."
236,Carly Meyer,"July 30, 2019",5,"So awesome and convenient This app doesn’t just tell you the weather and give you alerts for tornados and flash floods, it also tells you the mosquito index, running weather condition, tells you where lighting has stroked on a radar, humidity, cold and flu weather condition, and so much more! I personally always use this app and one more thing it has basically all cities I know of. I have a place in a very small town called Beaver Creek and I was so surprised that they had it I was just using a town next to it and then I searched Beaver Creek and they had it! You can also star/favorite different cities. I would really recommend this app to basically anyone or is such a cool app"

However, if an app is supported by advertising, it should not also require a fee to get back functionality that was originally free. I started using this app because the excellent weather app I had been using got bought out and “upgraded” to become a worse app. I.e. it lost some features and usability. I continued to use it for its map, but started using the Weather Channel App for its better daily and weekly forecast layout. Now, the same thing has happened to this app. Bought out and “upgraded” (i.e., trashed). The old layout was 10 times more user friendly than this supposed improvement. Once again, I’m looking for a new app to replace a good app gone bad. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Change for the sake of change is stupid and useless."

It is now buried below redundant screens like Radar and Daily Forecast that you can easily access from the Home screen. I don’t always have time to watch videos (Breaking News or Hurricane Central), but I do want quick access to current details in my area (wind, humidity, etc) and no I have to hunt for it. "
239,The_Starhorse,"January 22, 2020",1,"I despise this app with all of the burning hatred in my heart. So not to overstate things, but this app is so terrible, it should be counted as a criminal offense against weather itself. Their old weather app was great. It had actual information that you could see. It had weather alerts that you could actually get to. It was laid out in logical and sensible manner. This new and “improved” app was clearly laid out by a drunken tornado. Tiny, useless boxes are scattered in such haphazard fashion that you can’t find a thing. Weather alerts? I guess I better just look at the sky and decide for myself what’s coming, because this monstrosity is telling me nothing. The information is possibly accurate, if you can find it, but good luck with that. Go back to the old format, and simplify this train wreck if you want people to pay for it. And while you’re at it, apologize to the weather gods for desecrating what used to be a good app."

However, DO NOT like the political correctness global warming videos. These seem to all make man the culprit for every environmental catastrophe! Guess the world would be a utopia if it just wasn’t for us humans! We’re simply not that important in the universe.

Harder to easily get the information I want quickly.  The line graphs are hideous.  I used to be able to get the ten day forecast in a second or see the hourly changes easily.  Sometimes visual graphs are NOT the answer to making information easily available.  I may be 67 years old but I’m tech savvy and don’t have trouble adjusting to changes but this is a mess.  You have NOT improved this app.  The last time you updated I started looking for a different app but decided to stick with you since I couldn’t find one that I liked better.  However now that the shark has been jumped I will dump you and go to another.  I used to love you but you let us down (sigh).  So disappointing to be forced to give up one of my favorite and most useful tools.
243,TickedTrish,"September 3, 2018",1,"Horrible new Update WHAT THE HECK!!!!!! This update is beyond terrible - you just wait and wait AND WAIT for the app to even open it takes so long since the new update it’s crazy. I thought maybe it was just me but I’ve asked others and they hate the new update too. I’m going to stop using this weather app until I see a change has been made to speed things up. I also hate the degree graph you see as soon as you open the app up plus “Breaking News” pops up as soon as you attempt to scroll down - waste of my time. So if you can speed up the app when you open it, get rid of the wasted temp graphs, and please I don’t care about breaking news - fix those issues and I’ll be back. Sadly this past May I paid to get rid of adds and now I’m not going to even use this app. Somebody got bored at your end, made changes and did not do any of us any favors.

Ugly update which focuses on everything but your local area weather. The new font size for your weather is super small text, jammed at the very top of the app. When you used to open the app, it had your weather, huge, front and center, with a pretty visual background as well. It also had a blue background with white text, very easy to read, and now it has a white background with grey text. In order to find your local weather high and low for the day, you have to scroll and search for it. It’s ridiculous. "

I’ve tried turning my location services on and off but it never seems to work. I think I’ve tried everything and I don’t know what else I can do. And before this app had a new look a couple of months ago there was a science video section in the videos please bring it back!!! I would get on every day to see if there was a new video!!!

Out of all 4, the ""Weather Channel” app is the only app that does NOT send weather notifications. I waited several days to see if it would fix itself or maybe an update would come up with a fix but the developer of this app doesn’t respond to no emails or complaints of any kind. The interface of the weather channel app is awesome but that’s not what makes a good weather app. If the weather channel cannot alert for major weather events then what food is it. If a tornado was 2 miles away from me I want notified ASAP! This app is useless to me (and I had premium). If anyone wants this app for weather alerts I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND because you will die before this app will alert you in a weather crisis! Accuweather alerts every time for every kind of weather event. So does Weatherbug and 1Weather!"

I love the weather and I really wish I was able to get alerts everyday instead checking the app everyday. And seeing if it’s going to rain later. What time it’s going to rain.

There are so many unrelated boxes on the app, so many ads...when I click on what I think is an important weather piece, I have to sit through unwanted ads, then the video doesn’t play...it doesn’t buffer, it just doesn’t play.  It’s ridiculous to have ads on the front end and the back end of a weather news video.  I have given up on you TWC, you once were the number one source for accurate weather information, now it’s ads and unwanted TV shows.

So I start to look around into my settings as to why this is SO inaccurate and it’s putting my location somewhere that is NOWHERE near me. Even though it’s saying it’s my city, it’s actually reading the weather 3 major cities away from me. So why would I need an app that reads the weather in an area that’s that far away from me? That’s stupid. Useless. It has never been this bad but once they update crap, they ruin it. And I’m not paying money for an app that’s junk so in the trash it goes.

The old version was much better as I don’t want all the bell and whistles going warning that I might get two drops of rain or extra hot weather. I can get that when I look at the days weather. That’s what I hate is all the stupid bells and whistles going off or the flash messages telling me to turn them on. I don’t want to be notified when it’s going to rain or snow I will look it up if I want to know I don’t need someone second guessing what I want to know. It’s like tracking where I shop and such it’s none of your business.

When I’m trying to plan how to pack for a trip, this makes it much more difficult. And the icons are now much smaller and mostly grey, which are difficult to see.  The temps are huge and easy to read. But, when I’m looking a week or two out, I need to see rain, snow, and sun at a glance, as well as the forecast temps. The old format was MUCH more useful for that. "

I love the recent hourly forecast at the top, which switches to extended hourly forecast with a quick swipe. The new design also flows better than previous versions; it follows the same commands and layout as other popular apps. I’ve noticed a lot of negative feedback about the new layout- I would imagine most of the complaints are by older users reluctant to change. The new design follows the layout of other popular apps today making it much more intuitive. It has become the app of the present rather than the app of the past."

256,Rawson819,"October 1, 2018",1,Hate the Current Version! 😝 The last update was a HUGE step in the wrong direction! The Weather Channel app has for years been my go-to source for weather because it was intuitive and simple. Your last update complicated things and eliminated user friendliness. I specifically can’t stand the Daily view - you have a high and low temperature next to each other now? What rocket scientist thought that was an improvement over having the high displayed over the low? In making that change you doubled the horizontal real estate one has to scroll....why? Just so you could say you changed things. You have Today Hourly Daily at the top and then Hourly Daily options at bottom - I find this very confusing and the whole app is just plain difficult to navigate. I hate it and will use something else until someone comes
257,rofasix,"November 26, 2018",1,"“Mo better” app isn’t! Sometimes apps do get better as they mature. Other times, such as this version they go the other way.  This version is less user friendly & deleted useful data one used to depend on. I suspect when they spec’d this version, it was done by a bunch of desk jockey’s who work & play in a controlled 72 degree office. They had little idea how the rest of us used the old app, or why. That is so clear when they pretty much eliminated the real feel hourly feature. How do I dress to run or work outside when the temp is 38F & wind @ 12kts? Now I have to compute it, when before it was right there. This downgrade in utility is not as bad as the recent abomination created by “Storm Radar” but it’s close. In that case, l’m sure they are practicing “full employment” for s/w geeks. Perhaps The WX Channel ought to hire a few meteorologists for their development team to fix this sad mistake that you have created."

I am now interested in learning about today’s weather (even if it is just another 100+ degree day in Texas), weather or not (pun intended) it’s a good time to run, and if I should wash my hands a bit extra in case I see an increase of cold/flu around me.

Then it sent me to settings with an emphasis on privacy (location) settings.  My iPad mini is iOS 12.1.  It could be I don't have the ability to choose favorite locations, so the instructions are cryptic at best.  I could find no way to do it, so, I cannot have the feature I need--getting tornado alerts.  And like many people, I live hand to mouth and can't afford to subscribe, or have a fancy house with a tornado shelter in it.  And since I can't afford tv subscriptions either, I have to rely on the local fire house to blow their siren from a mile away to hear the tornado alert. Be safe all!"
260,jc2180,"March 21, 2018",3,Great info- just never correct for my home location I loved this app until I bought an outdoor home thermometer and realized the “current temperature” given by the weather channel app for my exact location is consistently higher than the actual temp. I tried several different outdoor thermometers just to be sure- and they all read the same temp within about 2 degrees... and all read 2-7 degrees cooler than the weather channel app current temperature. I’m still a fan of the app- but a word of caution. If you are depending on the app for anything important- run a test and be sure it is accurate.
261,PhotoNart,"August 29, 2018",5,"I use it daily and there is a good reason for that. Anyone with basic knowledge about weather knows, weather can be predicted, technology is far advanced from the last 2 decades, but weather itself, is not perfectly reliable to predict, yet. What I know and observe, helps me to fine tune the app’s prediction. I recognize micro weather zones and patterns, so I know what to expect. So far, this app is a great gain daily and should be deeply appreciated by all. Specially those with tendency to find negativity. Maybe one day they realize that an app, can aid them to figure, things are not as the see them. Hence, it is no the app (or else) but themselves what is perfectly predictable but inaccurate."

There is also no place where you can just glance at one screen and see the upcoming week in a quick summary. Actually there are no screens where you can see a quick summary of anything. Everything looks flat now, all in different shades of one color and very non-engaging. When I am barely awake and check the weather from bed at 5:00am, I don’t want to have to look at 6 different screens of complicated graphs and feel like I need to go back to school to get a degree in statistics to understand my weather report. I get that they are trying to be like modern and relevant to the current age but there is no reason for these changes. “Let’s complicate this app for the sake of complication. Let’s change for the sake of change, because everyone else is.” Sometimes change is good, but these changes are not."

When I go to the radar and try to move the map, scroll in or out the images of the rain go away.

What used to be an occasional ad, or video clip before a news story has turn into more.  Every time you log on it pushes the “premium” app up charge on you.  The pages are full of adds, and there are buttons on the app for features or map filters that when you click them it pops up another box to tell you it’s a premium version feature again pushing the sale.  If I signed up for everything that was only $5/month I’d be broke.  I am moving on to a different app.  Sure it will probably have ads too, but I’m tired of this one and the constant push for premium...I said no...multiple times.

My iPhone Weather Channel blasted at least 3 times before my local TV station came on with warnings. It was telling me a tornado was within 0 miles of me to take shelter immediately. The local channel went back to the ballgame breaking in every so often. But my Weather Channel app stayed with me constantly keeping me informed. 200 homes were damaged, and the extra minutes I was warned could have been life and death. I have a second home near Arkansas. I have relied on weather channel there too. From ice conditions to tornado. Love the radar views of what is coming."

I won’t even get into how many times I have been standing in the rain on a “zero percent” chance of precipitation day.

272,firehouse,"September 9, 2018",2,"Used to love it now I hate it The redesign is “pretty” but is not user friendly and I also feel like it is a downgrade. The ONE function I used the most was the at a glance for 5-10 days where you can see the highs, lows and chance of rain. Now you make me scroll through mornings and nights for a few days and it is so completely unintuitive it’s mind boggling. Also, now my radar rarely loads and almost never will animate. As a UI designer I really feel that you guys did absolutely no user testing before launching this. I get that you need ad support but forcing your viewers to scroll through pages of data to get one single bit of info is overkill. Will you keep making money when everyone ditches your app for something less intrusive and more useable? I’ll be moving on to a different app. I’m very disappointed."
273,Ranger RicD,"October 20, 2018",2,"Too many commercials After installing the app I looked at some of their videos; very good videos very informative. Downside, wow with every thirty-ish second video begins with those two girls doing the Pebbles commercial. EXTREMELY ANNOYING, you must watch five seconds before you can click Skip Ad. Imagine having ten thirty second videos you want to watch, then for each video having to watch the first five seconds of the same commercial. Okay okay okay, purchase the app for $3.99 that deletes the annoying commercial, better idea removed the app. As good as The Weather Channel is their app is aggravating, it is not worth the money. Many TV stations provide a much better app without cost. Yes, they have commercials that are a narrow line item at the top or bottom of the screen that does not interrupt videos and the like."

Listen to your reviews. No one complained about your layout, they complained about your overload of videos— which in turn, caused crashing and battery drain. Stop trying so hard and just listen. Also, whoever told you that line graphs were pleasing to the eye is complete liar. To top that off, light blue and white are also just as ghastly. I would literally pay to have the old layout back. When people check the weather, they are checking with purpose. We want relevant weather that pertains to us. Your overuse and emphasis on videos is kind of like adnauseum. We can handle a video here or there, but overloading us and making it almost unavoidable is just going to push us away."

I get a daily alert icon on the app when there is no adverse weather conditions predicted.  The only way to remove the icon from my iPhone display is by opening the Weather app.  The app is not customizable to only alert for the items I want to be alerted for.  I have written multiple times.  I got one response that said I can shut off all alerts from the iPhone settings menu which means I wouldn’t get notified of a pending tornado or hurricane.  That’s a brilliant suggestion!

The app seems to want to force feed videos when all I want is the weather and radar map.  Yes there are tons of annoying ads but I am guessing these would be removed with the in-app purchase. Unfortunately I can’t get past the poorly designed layout with all the video clutter to try and purchase a subscription. I gave three stars because to be fair the app is better then it used to be. The videos are not quite as forced and it is a bit better layout.  Adding option to remove or hide videos and focusing on what you do best, the weather, would go along ways to truly improving this app."

I’ve had the app for about a month and it was good for about a week but the past couple of weeks it hasn’t been telling informing me about when it will rain which is very important to me since like I stated earlier I have a longer commute. For this I’m giving it 3 stars because as of today I’ve been rained on 4 times because it didn’t say it was gone rain. What makes it worst is when it did say it’ll rain it didn’t!

Why not view all of it on one screen? Temp, high/lows, humidity, dew point, wind speed, and direction on one screen. If you want specific forecast by day, then you click a tab or scroll. Why do I have to scroll down or click to see what the humidity is or dew point? We’re not all interested in temperature. I use an evaporative cooler in Palm Springs CA and I need to know what the dew point is, temp is lower on my priority. Thanks though for making improvements. Did the UV info get moved or deleted?

It will let me put in Marietta, which is only 12 miles away, but when you are tracking a tornado, 12 miles can make a big difference.  The old one let me put in Sandy Springs, so I know the ability is there.  The new one is ok, I may like it better as I use it more.

I don’t mind having videos and such sprinkled in but the wavy forecast line thing is worthless really. Typically it won’t vary that much to be helpful. Highs and lows, precip, and humidity and simply cloudy sunny icons work well. Also some consistency across platforms. When I go to my iPad it is so dramatically different than the phone app. Consistency and stick with something that works. Every redesign you’ve done in the last five years has made things worse not better please simplify.  Good designers don’t need to redesign every so often to keep themselves in a job.

I don’t even believe what it says most of the time, and my friends and family also hate it. Says snow tomorrow, instead we have 45 degrees, it says sunny day we get thunderstorm instead. Sometimes I literally feel like forecast being created by 2 very drunk guys who are throwing darts in the wall with pictures of either rain, snow or naked ladies.

I’m back to using the Weather Channel app as my main weather app and recommend it with some caveats.   TWC still needs to improve that load time, I don’t want the splash screen, I want the weather now. I do respect that some advertising will come with that.

I understand others prefer the line graph, so what if you created a default preference selection in the settings for users to set it to?

I’m not going to use my weather app to look at the news, and I certainly don’t need notifications (even though I have notifications turned off within the app).

For those considering downloading this app, my recommendation is to take a look at several of them that offer more, without trying to get into your wallet.  This was a poor attempt at adding value, when in reality, it was basically taking away your free content and charging for it.

I’m willing to bet I could go online to the weather channel website and use it free but for some reason they think it’s okay to charge for the same features on an app because people will choose convenience of the app over the website. So very sad."
308,Andrew Bake'm,"February 16, 2020",2,"Puzzlingly Inefficient To be the most popular weather app, it’s pretty pathetic. Takes too long to load, the main page is way too busy, and the actual information I want to know (literally just temperature throughout the day and CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION) you have to scroll down or even click something just to get there. And since there are so many options of what kind of technical (and rarely useful) information about the weather you want to view, the actual important bits become confusing to navigate to consistently.

I loved the weekly display where you could see several days displayed graphically—a lot of useful information in an condensed, readable, attractive app. You could also swipe the screen and see the week for any of the locations you have saved.  You could tap on any day and get more detail. A huge amount of information, easily accessible.  "

Please fix the application to resolve it not opening and most of all please fix the issue of starting over every time the developers update the app. I get that it is free to use. However, it’s sporting the Weather Channel logo and that has to say something about the quality the application should have.

The blue used to be so easy on the eyes now you have to stare at a bright abrasive white layout And then try to grasp what the weather may be for the rest of the day and tomorrow quickly is almost impossible because it’s all graphed out now on that timeline.  The idea of it could work. The tabs at the bottom being simplified and the pull up radar; all of that is great. Why the heck would you remove the easy to see 15 day forecast and turn it into that line graph though. WHY?  It’s awful. Everyone I know uses the weather channel app and everyone I know now has chosen to not use the weather channel app and find another because of the new version. So just FYI..... maybe rethink your layout."

When I go to 0 - 14 day forecast I have to scroll down as opposed to just sliding my screen for the high/low temp and to expect rain or not.

Glad I don’t pay for it. I am not allowed to turn on any alerts for my mainly cities I am in or visit witch is only 3. They are saved but nothing will turn on and I have email now for a 2nd time and never get any support help at all. I am thinking about erasing the app off my phone for good. 70% of the time the radar is wrong. It will show it’s raining and yet nothing just cloudy and never rains. It would send an alert out of no where saying it’s going to rain and it’s going to be light and then it down pours. Then I check the radar nothing their but is a thunderstorm going on.  Like what am I suppose to do with an app that is wrong and don’t help me plan for the weekend let alone the same day.   Very very unhappy with this app.
320,nlgess,"September 4, 2018",1,Very poor updated version I love the Weather Channel and enjoyed using the old version of this app. Since the new version debuted I have been unable to set up the “My Alerts” feature. The locations never appear when I try to set up the alerts. And often the locations that appear on the home page are not correct. I have to close and reopen the app to get the location to update if I am in a different location. I have tried to delete and download the app again. That did not help. When I tried repeatedly to get help I got the exact same  email in response and no further response from the Weather Channel IT. I am totally frustrated. There is no way to search for a location. In the old app I was able to search for specific locations and set up alerts for those locations as I wanted. This version is a total waste.

It is extremely difficult to identify one day from the next. I can’t even do a quick check on the weather because I have to first figure out where each day begins and ends in the unnecessary graph. If you want to use graphs, create a separate app or link for that! I want to quickly open my app and know in an instant what the temperature is going to be and whether or not precipitation is heading my way. I am better off looking at a chart in a newspaper, which is sad. I will be looking for a new app. Learn your audience! The younger generation doesn’t even carry an umbrella.

Now, the app takes forever to load and is nothing but visual noise once it does manage to load. Local weather is merely an afterthought.

I don’t even have ADHD and it is really irritating and distracting! How many times do I have to see the ad for the Water Channel on the bottom of the page? (Answer: about every 10 seconds).

I can understand wanting it to seem somber, but with only slight shifts in tint between numbers of infected, it is hard to quickly determine which part of the range applies to each place. Surely you are aware that colors look different depending on which colors they are adjacent to. By choosing colors with only slight shifts, you have made it likely that they will be misread in some cases. I hope you add at least a couple of other colors to make this information more easily understood. Thanks."

I’ve gone into the app three times beckoned by the red badge to see what severe weather I need to prepare for only to be slapped in the face with an ad and no severe weather alert. This is a gross misuse of notifications that completely erodes user trust. I do not believe ads should be the primary function of any app, but the Weather Channel has turned their app into just that.

The radar is rarely accurate (usually 15-30 minutes behind which is not helpful in the least when I need it most: to find out when approaching storms will hit and where) and the radar loop takes a while to load (even on a 100 Mbps network). Last, there’s too much “fluff” - I don’t want weather videos. I don’t want to scroll through crap to find basic weather data. The weather app from my local news channel is far superior to what used to be the weather standard. I guess that was back when The Weather Channel actually broadcast the weather 24/7.

Tabs are back and they got rid of the ridiculous concept of scrolling through a single giant page of clutter to access information you want.

Won’t there always be a high and low for the day, why do we need a visual demonstration of it? Also, there are all kinds of boxes with different information listed, instead of it being in one area.

Now, I have to scroll scroll scroll, and the ten-day forecast renders smaller than before, presumably because phone screens are small.

For example, a few weeks ago in the morning I looked at the hourly forecast for the day. I planned on cutting my grass in the afternoon. It said there was 0% chance of rain each hour until 9 pm. At 2:00 pm there was a downpour and it rained for a good 1/2 an hour. I think they should say that there is a 10% chance of rain every day, every hour. At least then if it does rain they won’t be COMPLETELY wrong. Then yesterday night around 9 or 10 pm I got a notification from the app that TOMORROW IT WOULD BE NOTICEABLY COOLER WITH A HIGH OF 71.  So this morning I checked the forecast for the day to see how I should dress my kids. The temperature at 7 am was 71 degrees and the predicted high for the day was 80 degrees. Ridiculous!"

For an organization/entity as well established and recognized as “The Weather Channel”, the amount of advertising is overwhelming and inevitably causing me to use it less and less. Don’t get me wrong, I understand the need to support your company through the means of advertising. It’s just too much, tho. I am interested in just about every video posted on the app but not one can I watch without sitting through a long advertisement. On the home page, between every bit of useful information, more ads!

Looking at radar, you would think the weather was fine.  Old app always showed storms and color severity of storms on radar.  This app has no explanations of how to set radar, and it seems to just let you pick one option at a time.  Maybe I just don’t understand how to use it, but I used the old app with no problems for several years.  And I didn’t have to buy a yearly subscription.  I would gladly pay one time for a good app, but not yearly.  The app this replaced was much superior to this one."

And I’ve sent about three reports over the last almost 4 months now (which you have to email yourself 🙄 but it was annoying me so bad, I just did it) and never received a response or a fix from any of them. Then, they put out this new fancy update. It didn’t fix my issue, and it’s hard to figure out the weather. I just want a basics done accurate weather app which this one always was.

I love watching the weather and I use this app a lot, along with the Weather app that comes with my phone (which is sponsored by Weather Channel). Overall, it is a neat app- telling you what’s going on and all, but not really the “up-to-date weather”. In the middle of a thunderstorm, it told me that there would be clear skies from then and for the rest of the night. TALK ABOUT NOT RELIABLE! Also, when there is no WiFi, the app doesn’t cooperate well with the user! If I was in a space with no WiFi whatsoever, and a tornado was coming and we didn’t know it, this would have absolutely no use at all. Kind of disappointed at those things, but the rest of the app is fine (surprisingly)."

The home screen looks more suited to a phone than to a tablet. I appreciate all of the info that the app gives. I don’t appreciate the subscription price because the ads have got to go.

Also, this app is constantly asking if you want to upgrade and pops that message up interfering with anything I am trying to look at.   With an upgraded fee of course! It’s ridiculous.

I didn’t pay at first, but after a while I ended up paying again. NOW they want me to pay again every month to get rid of ads?  Are you kidding me?  I have already paid not to have ads!!!

The Weather app saves them but not the Weather Channel. And since a recent update, when you type in a city, the list of options no longer displays the State. So you don’t know for sure if you have the correct city until you make a choice AND then GO BACK to where you add cities to see if the city is in the correct state.

The new version has lost ALL of its usefulness except relaying temperature and telling me it’s raining. I used to use the app multiple times per day every day. Now, I avoid it and use the app included with iOS. I can’t find any of the data I used to find about whether it will precipitate at a given hour—information I need. The layout is fundamentally [rhymes with “ducked”] in that it is anything but intuitive and certainly isn’t logical. If users had been used to such a mess of an app from TWC, that would be one thing, but we’re not. The previous app could have, PERHAPS, used some visual updating, but there was no reason to “fix” something that wasn’t broken and end up breaking any loyalty users had to the platform as a whole. This app is utterly, irredeemably HORRENDOUS‼️"
371,Amovino,"October 9, 2018",3,"Prefer the previous format The new format is difficult to see at a glance and often misleading. The colors used in the graphic that comes up immediately when the app is opened are very light, and the font is thin and small. As a result, the “first glance” requires that I find my glasses. The previous format was easier to see. Additionally, the graph doesn’t necessarily show the high for the day. For example, the afternoon temp today was shown as 79. But the high today under the hourly listing was 81, perhaps because the high was achieved before noon. When I want to study the weather, having to go to multiple screens is fine, but when I just want to get a snapshot of the day’s weather, the new format is not to my liking."

It’s just so busy with everything except what I want to see. I like being able to see a whole hourly portrait view, to see what time it would start to rain/snow. Also, a simplified portrait view of the daily view, to quickly see what the weather was like 5, 10, or 15 days out. This is what I looked at 98% of the time. The other 2% was the radar, which is now also harder to get to.  Now with the white format I have to keep scrolling and switching to see what I’m looking for.

It was as though the funding of the weather channel depended solely on this app.  Then they added more, so it gets to the point where it is extremely slow to open and as you scroll new ads that were loading pop into existence.  You touch one and boom full size ad about something I don’t care about. I usually check the app if I need to know about something right now.  Is my car about to be decimated with hail?  Can I make it home over the mountain pass, or should I change my route.  Delays and ad BS are really annoying in these moments.  Now to top it all off it won’t even open.

I don’t understand why I’m seeing ads since I purchase it previously. Premium is $10-12/year.

Latest update more “pleasing to the eye” but trashed the simplicity and density of the app.  I used to be able to see 7 days out - then swipe once and see the next 7 days.  Now each day is split into morning and night so a day takes up 2 slots.  Only 3 days for on the screen and it’s too sensitive when I go to swipe it often registers as a tap.  It’s a phone app - simple is functional.  Typical progression toward too much complexity until the market demands a new iteration to manifest in the form of a brand new simple/functional app. When I click the feedback link I get a FAQ and no way to actually leave feedback.

However, there is a new “feature” or bug, depending on whether u r the advertiser or user, that disabled the ability to close a video ad while in full screen mode. This has been very bothersome to me. I am also with other reviewers who state that this update is aesthetically unpleasant. The UI also seems even more unintuitive than before.

Regardless of the update(s) and where you are (full service/strong wifi) the radar takes wayyyy too long to load and when it does it loads in chunks. If this feature was fixed/improved, i would rate 5 stars. "
404,duzallo,"June 10, 2019",4,Suddenly it won’t recognize my location I’ve tried installing and uninstalling 4 times and it comes up with a town I passed thru 7 days ago.  And I have location service on.   And you can no longer correct location.  I check other and my locations....This used to be the best weather app around.   What the hell happened?   I loved you guys.   Even watched your videos all the time.   I think I’m going to check out a local tv weather app.  And then text friends back home for updates on weather.  I live in the south in the winter and the north in the summer.  I need to keep an eye on both locations.   I’m really 😞
405,bcbc28,"April 19, 2020",1,Basically useless I used to like this app. It was streamlined and didn’t have the annoying tv personalities of my local weather station. But lately it has been filled with ads and it doesn’t even show national weather service warnings. It has a little banner when you open the app that shows active warnings for your location but some of these storms move so fast you need to know what’s coming your way and not what’s just in your county. We get lots of tornados where I live so that’s kinda important. I’ve looked through the app multiple times but just can’t find any way to turn them on. I’m sure as hell not paying them for information every other weather service gives you for free. If it doesn’t improve soon I’ll definitely be deleting the app. Basically useless.

I would rather donate to the Red Cross or another good cause than spend $9.99 to add extra features to your app. These features are free on so many other weather apps that don’t make me watch 15 State Farm commercials. My biggest peeve so far with the change to your app is it snowing like crazy here and an alert comes on my screen telling me lightning is close to my area, pay $9.99 and find out where it is! Really?!? Did I fall off the turnip truck? Ya’ll are killing me over here. I think I am going to stick with the “What the Forecast” and the TV for now. I hope some positive changes happen soon."

My love for the app has been ruined my the intrusive advertisements. I get ads are a means to make income for a free app and I have had no issue with that whatsoever. BUT when the ads started to become intrusive is when I started to dislike the app. It’s sad when you open the app to see the daily forecast and it gets pushed out of the way for a huge ad front and center, sad :-( and unfortunately I don’t wish to get stuck in a monthly or yearly rate to see the daily weather. I guess it’s time to look elsewhere for a weather app."

With this latest update, “today’s weather” is reduced to a tiny page, one of 7 pages with the remaining pages dealing with videos, hurricane information, health and activities, radar maps, etc. It used to be when you opened the app you saw the weather: temperature, humidity, dew point, wind direction & speed, etc. Now you get the temperature and feels like temperature.  For any additional information you have to click on the daily and then you get this tiny page.  I guess the bottom line is that this is the Weather Channel app.  It is showing you things that would appear on its channel. If you just want weather then this app probably isn’t the one for you."

Where it once had everything at a glance with a quick scroll down the screen, not there is so much that you have to weed through to find what you want. The ads have become very obtrusive and the only way to get rid of them is to buy a year subscription. Really?   Buy a subscription to a now crappy app??  I would have considered buying it when it was a great app. Now I'm just going to delete it. I guess you had a good run, but I'm now over you. Goodbye."

To the developer: instead of responding to users complaints with the same automated response of “give it another shot” or “it takes time”, please genuinely read the 100’s of reviews: we like what we like. I’ve given this app a good SOLID try and guess what? I still don’t like the complicated layout. I like simplicity as it sounds like most of your users do. So please stop giving me reasons WHY I should like it or why I should give it another try."

I have been using this app on and off for almost 10 years, and for almost that entire time it has used GPS to determine my  location, which is actually the north side of the city of Chicago, yet the Weather app lists me as being in “Fox Valley”, and it gives me weather forecasts for Fox Valley which, as far as I can tell, is a region 50 miles west of Chicago. I have reported this bug/bad behavior a dozen times, and nothing has changed. The only rational conclusion is that the developers simply don’t give a hoot. I’m frankly shocked that a company this big could be this careless and this inaccurate for so long. You’d think by random happenstance they’d have fixed this by now. Boo."

One of my 3 apps is The Weather Channel. Out of those three, The Weather Channel is the only app that NEVER sends me alerts/notifications even though I have every alert possible enabled and set exactly the same way as my other two apps that DO send alerts. I absolutely love the current version of The Weather Channel app but this issue with not receiving notifications makes it hard to give this app 5 stars. Please fix this issue!

I also love the natural disaster and ongoing crisis alerts. They are very helpful and fast and give me information on the go that I wouldn’t have known unless I watched the news every 2 hours.

When you open up the app and try to do anything, it will kick you out of the TWC app and take you right to the app store on your phone to download an advertised app they have. No warning. No asking. No pop up asking you to go to the app store... just boots you right out of the weather app to take you to some BS advertised app on the site. It’s ridiculous. To the point where I deleted it after many years of having it on my phone. I 100% understand and expect advertisements to be on the app while I am scrolling to get my weather information. That I understand completely. What’s ridiculous it the way it forces you now to the app store. Do not get this app. Support a different weather app."
419,Jason.cannon2,"November 11, 2019",1,"This app is horrible The app itself, works flawless. The content is horrible. Daily forecast never matches what the hourly forecast is. For instance I checked it today to see what tomorrow will look like. Today is  a Monday. Tomorrow’s low forecast is 20 degrees and rain. Difficult to believe water will be falling from the sky when it will be 12 degrees lower than freezing. Seeing it may be possible I check the hourly forecast and it shows that it won’t be 20 degrees until Wednesday morning around 7am and Sunny. Hourly show Tuesdays lows are in the low 40’s. Never matches and you can’t rely on one forecast over the other as they fluctuate wildly and are rarely correct. If they were consistently wrong the same way each time I’d figure it out. I couldn’t see paying for a premium subscription with all the inaccuracies."

422,Shazzan!,"January 29, 2019",3,"Better, but I still don’t prefer this app anymore I was glad to see that they reduced the ad size and constant flashing of the changing ads, as it was very distracting. The visual contrast has improved slightly but it’s still not as “eye-friendly” as it used to be. Just above the graph is a tab that slides from Today-Hourly-Daily, and because the selected tab is white on white, I never even knew that was a dragging tab for months. I am also assuming this new app designer is in a warm climate, because the “FEELS LIKE” temperature is rarely listed in the different page choices. You have to search for it. Those of us in cold climates need to see it as part of the forecast like the other weather apps do."

When it works, it is an ok app. Some nice features. Seems that every three or four times I launch the app it freezes and I have to exit out, and fully close the app and restart it to get the weather. Needs stability. It seems every update destabilizes the app. Also would be nice if notifications allowed option to select various levels (watch, warning, gov’t) each or all. I live where we get a lot of thunder storm watches. Set notifications and my phone goes off all night. Have them turned off now. UPDATE 2020.

The forecast is often incredibly wrong; I get better forecasts listening to the local radio and television shows. The app takes forever to load and I have unlimited data on the Verizon network. There are government radar and other apps that paint a much better picture of storms as they’re moving in. If you need an app that gives a very BROAD picture of what the weather MIGHT be then by all means download this app. "

It shows the current clouds but once you hit the play forward butting it shows nothing even when it’s about to rain or rains shortly after. The new interface is still just as bad as it was when you rolled it out. I gave it a chance like you all asked but it went from my favorite weather app to my least favorite ! I lived TWC App before because yours is more accurate by far. But the work it takes to find out what’s coming is ridiculous ! I give up !"

I just want the weather. I have had this app for a long time and the new update is ok and I don’t mind the ads, I get that but making people pay for premium to get longer hourly is ridiculous.

Now you are forced to watch an ad that may be as long as 30 seconds before each video, and often it’s the same ad over and over and over.  Does the weather channel really need to run ads on their site to make money??  Can we please limit these in some sort of way?  I’m about to just delete the app!"
430,GinBigD,"May 27, 2018",4,"Probably the best that I have used,... but that’s not saying a lot. My one major gripe is this: The ads that are displayed take up about a quarter of the screen, at the bottom, including the radar screen. This puts the radar animation control bar almost at the middle of the screen. I thought that by paying a few bucks to go ""ads free"", this would move the animation control bar to the bottom of the screen, in the freed up space. Not so…it remains in the same place it was when the ads were displayed. My advice: Don’t pay for “ads free“. You aren’t gaining anything. I won’t be paying for it a year from now."

It’s a true shame that TWC app has fallen victim to this sort of thing, they’ve lost me (and I’m sure many others) to this decision to provide a “premium service” that, again, can easily be found elsewhere *without ads and/or paywalled premiums*."

It’s 2020 twc u should be ashamed.. y’all don’t have the balls our heart to join the rest of us in the new quest to not only try and better ourselves each and everyday but as well to help others in theirs as well.

I’m paying $12/year for something I can get for free and they seriously want another $4 to remove ads. Technically I’m paying the most of all their subscription options. It’s getting harder and harder to justify paying and still getting ads. Probably cancel soon and move on after next update or payment due if ads continue to be this bad.

In between each day on the daily view! Really?! Not necessary. And every time I open the app it asks me to join premium. I’m not paying for the weather!

I can’t just go for a quick view of the weather. You have to figure out where to go to find the information you want. There is too much going on and it’s not visually appealing. Before the update I loved the app. It was pleasing to the eye and easy to see all the info you wanted. I wish they could go back to the way it was. It aggravates me every time I go into it. The only thing is it gives you the temperature right away. I don’t want to change pages to see the actual forecast for that day and go through all the other things to do so. It’s just too much stuff that I don’t care about. I loved how the background of the old app depicted your current weather.

I wish I could go back to the previous version where the information I wanted (today’s weather and the 15 day forecast) was easy to read and right there.  Now the app barely has any color, it’s mainly gray and a glaring white, and that pretty much sums it up.  Not sure what you were trying to accomplish but I don’t need charts and trends, I just want to know what the weather is going to be!

It is difficult to find and see the chance of rain. The “today” tab is useless to me yet it keeps defaulting to that each time you open the app.  I prefer the weekly and hourly options.  Your ads and info box take up more space on the screen than the actual weather.  The blue background was so much more pleasant and easy to read.

All of my notifications in the Weather Channel app are turned off since I started getting these, so I have no idea how or why I’m getting notifications now. The notifications give some sort of vague encouragement to open the app (i.e., “Planning your week? Check your latest forecast for what to expect.”) These notifications are NOT desired and not even helpful. Please allow us to turn them off without turning off every notification. Very close to ditching this app and going elsewhere. The rest of the app seems fine for checking the forecast occasionally, hence the two stars."
456,Jacque hagedorn,"February 28, 2020",1,"Don't pay for premium! I used to like this app , but the annoying ads got so bad that I purchased the premium to get rid of the ads. Ever since then, it's almost impossible to watch a video- it crashes every time I push a video link . It takes about 5 or 6 times to eventually get a video to run without it crashing. It's nonrefundable , so I will endure it until the year is up and then I'm getting rid of the app. A lot of the videos are annoying anyway, as they are very negative & mostly about climate change - to the point that it's obviously very politically motivated. I have to see enough of that everywhere else. Totally not worth the premium price ( especially with the crashing every single time that I want to watch a video)  I would give it a zero if I could."

I do enjoy watching the videos that are on the app however only the add plays.  My phone is set for 3 minutes time out so that is long enough for a video to load. I feel like I’m supposed to purchase a subscription to be able to see the video after the add. But I’m not going to. I have had the weather Chanel app for years and slowly and gradual I am becoming unenthusiastic about the weather Chanel app. The area I live in I need accurate weather news within a reasonable time frame and that’s just not happening. It’s not my phone as it’s a new phone and the settings are appropriate for what I need.  Not enthusiastic about the app anymore. I have decided I’m deleting this app.

I’ve always enjoyed the way they display all the storms and all the features of their radar as well as the people who tell you about the weather. Your media allergist are some of the best. The way they explained the weather and make it so that everybody can understand it is amazing. The technology that you guys have brought forth is amazing. Now that I can have it back on my phone I am a happy person again

461,Yogoyoyi,"September 3, 2018",1,"Update is horrible I would have given this app a 5 star rating before its recent update. This update is more complicated, less user-friendly, and less feasible. Prior to the update, the interface was easy to see basic information, and all you had to do was scroll for more information. Now, you have to click different options to get the info that was readily available on one screen before. The contrast is also very mild. I can navigate it, but it’s definitely more complicating than before . I would highly recommend and update that reverts back or closely resembles the previous interface. This is just annoying, honestly. I apologize for the bad review. Like I said, you had my 5 star vote. I just think this update was too much over-analyzed and perhaps a mistake."

I used to love this app and now it’s not even worthy of the one star rating. I can’t believe they thought this should be released. Background is completely white and blinding. Difficult to differentiate between sections or even data for each data other than a slight font size difference. It was also much easier to view the extended forecast with the nightly temps underneath each day instead of side by side. Overall the new design is clunky and poorly overhauled...like going backwards in time and seeing a draft version with no graphic design edits. The new version is more focused on ads and videos. Pathetic and no longer user friendly.

My dad was a VP at the company a while back...I’m in a Weather Channel loving family...but until they undo the “improvements” that have been made recently, I’m sticking to the app on my phone.

I have reported it numerous times to the makers of the app and still have NOT even received a response - no response at all.

And the changes are bad.  Version 4.5.1 wasn't ""broke"" -- it was a really nice, clean app and info was easily and immediately accessible.

This morning was the last straw when it sent me a notification at 4:45 am about upcoming rain in my area around 10 am. If I change the settings for an app I expect them to remain until I say otherwise not for them to change every time they feel it is necessary.

Change is good but only if it makes something better. This app is worse. And now after going to another city and returning home it keeps the current location the city we left, not our home city.

But in yet another attempt to sell anything by any means, they now want me to pay extra to remove the advertising portion of the excrement they are pushing. I am finding that a simple thermometer, a rain gage , and a barometer are exceedingly more accurate and efficient weather forecasting tools than the weather channel app and I can get my information in a fraction of the time it takes for the app to load."

At first I thought it was my phone or connection but it has persisted thru phones and connections. It’s usually the one video I really want to hear—a severe weather update, etc so that’s really frustrating. The ads prior to it have perfect sound, just not the video. Anyway, other than that, the radar is awesome, I love the overlays and how much they can be customized. Overall an excellent resource for local weather."

It was supposed to be a nice weekend this past weekend and it rained and it was very cold they had everything wrong on their app as well as what they’re telling everybody. The app said one thing they were telling people on the TV another thing. They are just like psychics but psychics should get paid then without having to say for your entertainment only. Or maybe the weather people need to start using for your entertainment only. They need to get their heads out of their computers and open a door to go outside and see what’s going on.

Actually seeing YOUR forecast is difficult because the page is cluttered with random crap about other parts of the country, along with ads. Lots and lots of ads. The video you try to watch might not actually play, but the ad before it definitely will. Location services are bizarre, too; the app completely misidentified which city I live in. Fortunately, they haven't gotten rid of the GOOD version. Hopefully they never will. Somehow, they scammed me into downloading this atrocity again under the premise that it was a new app, but when I came here to write a review of how awful it is, I discovered that I had already panned it three years ago. It was horrible then, and it's even worse now."

Some of the great changes made could have been simply implemented in to the old layout.

There is almost zero information about the weather forecast for my area and the way the future forecast is now presented is difficult to read. Can you please take it back two or three updates?

Same with seeing rain and temp updates for the next several days.  Then, a year or so, some “genius” decided to scrap all that and go to smaller little windows that just don’t show much.  Changing to show multiple windows on the screen was a mistake!  It almost feels like the competition took over management of this app with the intent to make it worthless.

I could glance at it and immediately know what the day was going to be like. This app is so hard to use and read.  I finish looking at it and am still don’t know what the weather will be like.

The WeatherBug app is much more intuitively designed than TWC app is. It always opens and it never crashes. It’s ads are less intrusive. It gives you dew point on both current stats and the forecast. This is all important for perception of how hot it is in the summer. I think they all get their info from the NWS, so nothing is lost in accuracy if that is a concern.

What you did with the weather channel app should embarrass you. Out of all the really good UX developers you came up with this. It kind of reminds me of when Quisnos had that commercial with the rats and made the business fail. This app reminds me of those rats. FYI somebody on the UX team needs to go back to color theory school. Your attempt to use white is done in all the wrong ways. Please consider reader comprehension, varying screen brightness levels, ambient light, night shift, and on and on."
506,Psalmist27,"January 4, 2019",1,"One of the worst updates I’ve ever seen It’s amazing to think someone would design this “new” update and believe it’s actually an improvement. I want you to know, I gave it weeks thinking I’d adjust.  It hasn’t happened. I still hate it. The reason I used the old version so often was because it was a quick, easy way for me to access the information I needed.  Now, it requires me to hit tabs and scroll and scroll and scroll. That is not an improvement.  If you want to add new features, I thinks that’s great (and would probably be appreciated if it was more of an option as opposed to forced) but don’t sacrifice the features that make this work so well for so many people. It doesn’t matter how pretty you make it if it doesn’t work well for the average user."
507,Baldfellow,"December 15, 2019",4,"Excellent app with one flaw Like the other reviewer, I've been relying on the apple weather app for years, and recently I've noticed it locking up, or otherwise malfunctioning. Finally i got smart and downloadedThe weather Channel app, and it's great,, and works very well. It deserves 5 stars in most respects, butI gave it 4 stars to emphasize a point. Since we travel a good deal, I like to store a lot of different cities for quick reference, but they allow you to store only 10. I suppose to most folks that's more than enough, but I would prefer to store more. So if possible I'd like to see that upgraded. Thank you."
508,eSharp7,"November 27, 2019",2,"Updates Ruined App I have been using The Weather Channel app for about as long as I’ve had a smart phone... and that’s been a long long time.  I’ve put up with a lot of changes, and most have been good.  I’ve put up with the addition and then the influx of ads.  Fine.  But now the latest update has ruined the 10 day outlook.  It is a significant step backwards.  Previously I got a simple snapshot: H/L Precip for 10 days.  Now I get a mini forecast for each day with Day and a single temp, Night and a single temp.... but is that the high? Is that the low? Is that the average? It’s just not an improvement at all over the previous experience.  Clearly the people who design this app don’t use this app.  So I’m finally saying goodbye."

Now they have a biased agenda, and all you get are snapshots of misleading videos. The tipping point for me came when TWC posted footage of a sickly polar bear rifting through trash, and foaming at the mouth (the poor thing probably contracted rabies!). Then, subtitles accompanied by sappy music come rolling in, “claiming” man-made climate change is to blame for the ill bear! Total BS! Did the photojournalist have evidence ruling out naturally occurring and/or acquired diseases? No! He made up a scenario in his mind, submitted it to TWC, and then his very weak conclusion from his non-existent/unscientific study, becomes fact to a lot of people who watch it. Sad. It’s just sad. Pure example of propaganda at its finest and most modern state."

As a result of the upgrade, the app now takes intolerably long to load (minutes instead of seconds), all of my favorite and recent locations are gone, and a couple of them are no longer retrievable.  When I go to add the locations that I can find, the app crashes."
512,Wala/jawaka,"June 18, 2018",2,What happened to TWC? I’ve had this app for years and it used to be pretty well layed out but I don’t know if it’s just bad meteorologists or what but the 5 day forcasts are never right.  It’ll say 0% chance of rain and flood or it’ll say 100% chance of rain and never rain.  One day Tuesday will call for 80% chance of rain  and when Tuesday arrives it’s only 10%.  On top of that there’s more weather commercials and ads than there is weather.  You also have to scroll down a long page just to see the radar instead of making it directly accessable from the top with just a click.  I hope these issues can be fixed.  I’ve had the app for too long to have to do away with it.
513,Demoneangelo,"August 6, 2018",1,"Awful I downloaded this app for the hourly breakdown and storm prediction, and it is one of very few apps I allowed the push notifications. Living at the edge of tornado alley and in an area that sees large thunderstorms and huge hailstones throughout summer, I figured the alert system would help me prepare. Big mistake! This app sends about 10-12 push notifications any time a storm hits what is basically ANY part of my state, most of it not having anything to do with my location (I have location services on and have double checked that it does, in fact, have my correct location loaded into the app). Unfortunately due to the constant redundant and pointless notifications clogging up my phone, I have had to disable them for the app altogether, rendering it altogether useless."

However, it has been quickly going downhill at an unprecedented rate for such a big company.  First came the ads.  These were annoying, but easily able to be overcome.  Then they got worse and more obtrusive.  Still wasn’t that bad, just very annoying.  Now the app doesn’t even update at times and I will login in the afternoon and the app still thinks it’s morning unless I manually refresh it.

Before, it was easy to read, functional, topical and reliable. Since the update, the app takes significantly longer to load, if it doesn't crash and force-close. Then, once it finally loads, the 'new' design is not appealing; it's not intuitive, and the colors are terrible. Additionally, whichever locations you chose to save as favorites, for some reason always get deleted. At first, I thought it was associated with updates. Now I realize it's totally random, and it happens with more and more frequency. I recommend going with one of the other weather apps. Even the stock Apple weather app is significantly better than the Weather Channel app."

It takes forever for the app to load and if I want to go to the radar, I can be assured that the storms will probably be out of the country much less my area, by the time it loads. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m much more reliant on my local news channel weather app because at least I know it’s not going to go from summer to winter before the app loads."

After those long rainy days, I want to know how much rain accumulation we have had. My current options are to 1) buy a rain gauge for my yard or 2) ask a local farmer and that’s not quite what I want to do every time it rains.

Used to have a great table showing current week forecast by day, all on one screen, column for each day with hi-lo temp, rain chance percentage, humidity percentage, period.

With a few minutes of exploring it has become second nature to curse at the phone and shut down the app.  Days later, I almost start swearing before I open the app – it has become second nature… This app is busy and maybe more for an ipad than a phone.  I live in Manhattan and trying to use this app creates a traffic jam on the sidewalk.  I already paid to not see ads, but deleted it off my phone [yesterday].

I used this app with 3 other weather apps.  The Weather channel consistently over predicts rain on the hourly forecasts compared to the other apps and then it doesn’t rain.  I understand that 80% chance of rain means that 20% of the time it will not.  However, when you check the weather and it says 80% between 1am and 12pm and you wake up to sunny sky’s I’m left scratching my head.  Then they have the audacity to have a premium option to see more into the future in the hourly.  I wouldn’t pay $0.01 for that.

It may offer more detail but its not presented in a user friendly or pleasant way. This is especially true of the graph on the fist page when you open the app - everything is so small, the white background makes it hard to read, there are too may ads and the wavy trend line across the page is unnecessary. In my opinion, the daily view, which shows you the basics for the next five days is what most of us want to see at a glance when you open the app but it still needs a face lift."

The new GUI makes it more difficult to see future weather which was the bet part of the old app. The new app is great for the current and 24 hour forecast but is almost impossible to get a simple weekly forecast.  I use other apps instead but wish this app had kept it simple because it was a favorite. Perhaps they could create a secondary app for those of us who don’t need minute by minute info since we can look outside and see it’s hot/cold/raining/etc. but want to know what’s upcoming without watching the local news.

You get prompted every time you open the application to upgrade to premium, yet there are dozens of reviews complaining that premium simply doesn’t work. I took a break from this app for about a year several years back when they changed it to a single scroll interface.

I’d constantly get sensationalized alerts for things happening in far-away areas of the country. The redesign completely ruined the app for me. Too much garbage extra content and not enough actual information that is easily accessible. Weather apps have one job to do, and this one does it extremely poorly.

The notification settings are vague and don’t give you much ability to control the rate of notifications just the type of notifications. I have had times where I open the app to clear a notification just to have it send another one within minutes of leaving the app. It is insane and for a weather app. At least put it a setting to o my allow notifications say once an hour.

559,lapstraked,"June 23, 2019",2,"Missed the Mark Really wanted to like this app but it has some major flaws. I tried to turn on notifications for government issued severe alerts and it kept saying my phone GPS was turned off. I have my phone settings correct to allow the app to get my location only while using the app so don’t know what the issue is. Tried to turn on Significant Weather alerts and it said I didn’t have any favorites saved with no clear instructions on how to add favorites. Final straw for me was that radar has no option to turn on severe weather boxes, only an option for tropical storms. Frustrating and disappointing. Deleted app.  Hoping to find a functioning weather app without all the bloat."

Think it’s finished loading, attempt to scroll, wait. Click on something and wait. They’ve overloaded the page with too much. Forecast for the day, the week, 15 days, Radar, videos, and ads on top of everything else. There’s just too much going on and the app can’t handle it."
561,Chardee-MacDennis,"September 1, 2018",1,"HATE the new app!!! I’ve used the Weather Channel app for the last 8 years and been satisfied with it (though I agree with other comments about the unnecessary number of videos and some inaccuracies). The new version of the app which has just been introduced is horrendous. I’m a busy mother of three who needs to be able to check the forecast at-a-glance as I’m getting everyone ready to run out the door to school. The new look makes it so difficult to pick out the simplest of information and is so cumbersome that I’ve decided to get rid of the app altogether and find something better. If I wanted to study graphs I’d have become an analyst. I’ve never left a review for an app before, but hate this new version so much that I felt compelled to do so. It’s the worst."
562,Theora Locke,"September 12, 2018",1,"🤨 After reading a large portion of the recent reviews,  Getting a “Developer Response” is worse than getting no response.  Are they using their own app?  What kind of ‘extensive testing’ are they doing to prove that ‘it becomes second nature after spending a few minutes exploring’?  With a few minutes of exploring it has become second nature to curse at the phone and shut down the app.  Days later, I almost start swearing before I open the app – it has become second nature… This app is busy and maybe more for an ipad than a phone.  I live in Manhattan and trying to use this app creates a traffic jam on the sidewalk.  I already paid to not see ads, but deleted it off my phone [yesterday].  AccuWeather isn’t perfect, but at least I can use it."
563,JDJ84,"September 16, 2018",1,"Newest version = worst version yet This latest version gets only 1 star. The font is too light in color, too small, and getting a quick view of what’s happening is impossible. I don’t need videos of weather that has happened recently or not in various areas. I need to know what’s happening in my area — quickly. White background with light grey text is a bad design idea. I’d bet your average user age skews much older than what you’ve designed this version for. Please redesign. I’m the meantime, I’ll be looking for a replacement app, which I don’t really want to do, because I’m a bit of a loyalist. However, when an app renders itself useless due to modifications that are unnecessary and destroy the user experience, there may be no choice than to go elsewhere."

I gave this recent upgrade a couple of weeks to see if I could get used to it. I’m very disappointed that I still find it cumbersome and harder to see things at a glance. The white background coupled with smaller font makes everything harder to see and find. Plus, the previous daily/weekly view was a great feature, now it’s harder to see and requires too much scrolling. After many years of TWC, I’m looking for a different weather app. Hopefully the app makers are reading these reviews to learn what consumers think (as most reviews I see  here are negative about the upgrade)."
565,Zombieatingdude,"January 29, 2020",1,"Unnecessary Monetization Been using the weather channel app since the first ipod touches came out. Generally speaking, the app usually worked well and was quick to access. Since the last update, not only is the app slower, but you also get annoying ads that pop up. Usually when you check the weather on your phone you don’t have access to wifi, so if the network is bogged down or you are in an area with poor cell reception (hiking for example), you can’t access the weather info because the ads will not load."

Tons of wasted screen space and just a rotten user experience. You used to be able to tap on the weekly forecast and see a nice, full-screen interface with all the info you need. Now it’s confined to a tiny little box that just makes no sense. The app went from being a nice, full screen experience to suddenly looking like a set of floating weather widgets floating in a sea of nothing. I’ve been using this app for years, but as soon as I’m done typing my opinion of how they ruined this app, I’ll be looking for another app to take its place. I do NOT recommend. It’s not worth the time it takes to download. iPad users can do better."

570,bdwalker43,"June 5, 2018",1,"A50% chance of rain, 99% chance the forecast isn’t right. I work for a contracting company where the weather strongly effects my day of work. Literally every time it is supposed to rain, the forecast changes 30 minutes before. Example: today it was supposed rain at 11AM, with a 35% chance, and at 12pm with a 75% chance. Now, it is not supposed until 12pm, and it’s only a 30% chance. But, it will likely change in the next couple minutes. This is not a one time deal, every time they are calling for rain, it is wrong. Also, the radar literally says there is a “red zone” above me with a severe thunderstorm warning, and it’s sunny and not cloudy. I would not recommend this app to anyone that actually checks the god forsaken weather. God bless and amen."

What a disaster of an app. I downloaded the app to have quick, up to the minute weather and through all its faults over the years, it still did the trick. Now, with the new update, I am inundated with too much information that I definitely don’t want. Graphs, trends, blah blah blah. I want to know the weather. In my area. I want the radar. I want up to the minute weather. I want the old version back. It was my go to app 5 times a day. The new version gives me a headache. Gives me inaccurate weather. It is giving me last nights weather at noon. It is most definitely NOT 74 degrees right now on a summer day in the D.C. area. What a disappointment. Now I have to find a new app. So sad."

When I open a weather app, I want to see what today’s weather will be and a quick overview of the week’s forecast.  There are so many windows and swipes and toggles in this app that it is increasingly hard to find basic information.  I want to know if it’s going to rain later in the week without touching a single thing. Cluttering with fancy “features” really defeats the purpose of a weather app.  The advertising is obtrusive, but I’m glad I didn’t pay for an upgrade to get rid of them.  Stop trying to make your app more “interesting” by getting rid of everything that makes it intuitive."

Without having to scroll, scroll some more, switch the screen, click on a button.  I don’t care for the videos automatically popping up, the “s m a l l”  font, the shades of font, etc. For anyone with a vision issue, they can not even use the app.  They can not see much of the screen.

This used to be my most used app and now I  can’t stand having to spend so much time hunting around for what should be an easy task of seeing 1) what the weather is currently and 2) what it’s going to be in the future. Especially disappointing is the weekly snapshot, which is now completely illegible—the highs and lows have the same font treatment there is no distinction between each day, so it’s suddenly impossible to simply check what the forecast is for tomorrow and the next day at a glance. Really frustrating. Having the radar more easily accessible is nice but that’s the only improvement I can see. I’m disappointed."

Frankly this app was best on my I phone 4 than your last version on my 7plus and now there is even more useless information and pages to thumb through than before. Maybe the people who leave comments don’t have anything better to do than ponder the days temperature line but I bet most of us just want to see the important data at a glance. Frankly this is the first comment I have ever left for any app and I’m surprised I am taking time to leave one now - I suppose I’m angry at the prospect of learning new software every five minutes for every app

I live far from most of the activities I participate in, so this information allows me to adjust my driving time to allow for bad driving conditions.  Lastly, I not only can check on the weather in my immediate area, but also the surrounding areas and any other area I request.  The weather channel app is a great help in planning my day."

I do not want to watch videos of birds being rescued or anything that does not relate to the weather when I use a weather app. I simply want to know the forecast and to be warned of severe weather when it affects me.

I also don’t like that I now can no longer switch between locations just by sliding the screen back and forth. Now I have to go into the locations in the upper right corner and choose which location and then wait for that to load. Not good.

This app warned my family that a tornado was coming and also helped my young ones not be scared during the time we were in the basement. The weather channel gives us accurate forecasts and even gives us news about pollen and flu.

I understand that from time to time a re-fresh is necessary, but what once was good is now crap.  Alerts for me won’t turn on, it says that a location must be saved as a favorite, but when I click on that, it takes me to location services of the iPad?!?!?  Hm, and yet on the top of the “home screen” it says where it is, and is giving the forecast.  Along with that, I really appreciated the previous version of the app crashing as the means to let me know I need to upgrade to the newer version, thanks."

Then current weather radar, lightening strikes, etc have become delayed up to 10 minutes? But the request for ""Premium"" is never late, if The Weather Channel app got rid of Watson would things improve?

As for Apple TV it no longer shows the weather, just videos of past weather news on area of the US I don’t live in. It doesn’t give you any longer the option to check the weather. I called someone on technical support for the app but the response I got from the gentleman when I pressed by it’s not as great....” if you don’t like it, then don’t use our app”.

Now they are all displayed in the same horizontal line alternating the highs and lows, so no more quick and easy glance at the weekly highs or lows.

The line graph is annoying visual clutter. It’s quicker to digest when the high temp is above the low rather than setting them side by side. When I swipe down I feel like I hit a wall of crap I don’t want to see. Lord knows where the radar map even is. I can’t get to it before throwing my phone across the room. I could go on...

And if the pictures and print is pale in color it’s impossible to see.  I’m sure I’m not the only one that has this or other eye problems that prevent them from fully getting the weather info.

I really like nothing about the new format. I know change is hard and sometimes I get used to something after awhile. But I’ve had the update for a few weeks now and I still don’t like it.

With that being said, I don’t appreciate having to watch a 9 minute advertisement just to watch a small news clip about a dead zone the size of Florida. I didn’t mind watching a short 15-30 second ad for the ability to watch a few videos in a row, and I held my tongue when it changed to watching one ad for every video; but having to watch a 9 minute ad before watching any video? This is getting ridiculous. I watched for over a minute patiently waiting for the option to skip the ad, but it never came. Please find a way to improve this process. I understand that this is a business and advertisements bring in revenue. But 9 minutes? Is anyone else having a problem with this?"
611,Lite news reader,"August 6, 2018",2,"A step backwards I kept the older version of this as long as possible, eventually being forced into an update. This version is slower to load and the interface is much more cumbersome. Personally I prefer the information as presented in the older version and this version is not nearly as useful to me. I have replaced this app as my primary weather information with a different one that is much more simple and useful to me. Please consider offering the older version once again as there are many who prefer information presented quickly and simply and not information wrapped in excessive layers of GUI and advertisements. Fast loading and quick data always wins for me."
612,SoCoJM,"August 31, 2018",2,"Terrible update I’ve used this app for many years, since my first smart phone. I use it everyday and many times a day. This new update to the format it AWFUL! I used to just open the app and be able to see everything I wanted about the current and future weather for my area. Now, it’s confusing, and sometimes"
613,OneShotOneKill889,"September 3, 2018",1,"Not user friendly I purchased the weather channel max app a few years back ($3.99) because I liked it over the iPhone weather app and didn’t want ads like the free weather channel app. Well they changed the app and made me pay, again, for a new version, that was strike one. They have continued to update and add videos of stuff that is completely irrelevant to my areas of interest, that was strike two. Now they have redesigned the app and made it so busy and visually unappealing I’m going to remove the app and go back to the basic iPhone version. I don’t need to see all the garbage and unappealing GUI just to get an update on my weather. It’s ridiculous how something so simple and easy has been blown away. Good job at making the app horrible."
614,shepod,"September 5, 2018",4,"I miss the blue background I’m all for changes and improvement but something about this new update doesn’t allow for a quick and easy view. The blue background with white lettering has to come back! So much easier to view! And the scrolling was easier, vs now, having to look for, and choose, the correct tab. And it’s just harder to distinguish between different days. I love the weather channel...it’s been my go to weather for 20+ years...nothing better out there...but this new update to the app is too much, too busy, to cumbersome."
615,Chknsoup,"September 13, 2018",1,"This upgrade is extremely confusing The old version had maybe an ad or video too many but everything was easy to see at a glance.  I though I’d like this version because it has a button for the different sections. Unfortunately it turns out it has two buttons for the sections I mainly check and while labeled the same they do different things. When I do get to where I want to be, the information is so spread out it makes me not care about the info anymore as if my brain finds it to tiring to comprehend. I’ve never used any other sites app for weather so I don’t know if any others are any better. If not, at the worst, this version will should end my obsession to check the weather - which may not be a bad thing."
616,Tish222,"September 28, 2018",1,"Updates just keep getting worse and worse The 10 day/daily summary is difficult to read, with day and night highs/lows right next to each other and not much color difference to distinguish between them. The whole layout is a bit complicated and cumbersome. The video section is annoying. A thumbnail of a video you no longer want to watch will keep playing unless you swipe it offscreen. Also, there are video ads before each video. Sorry, I’m not going to even go into the video section anymore because of how many ads there are between short videos... ugh I wish the app was the way it used to be, a long time ago, just more basic, efficient, straightforward, and easy to read."
617,weathersnap,"November 13, 2018",4,"Missing my app I am very disappointed that I updated my weather channel app. I wish I could go back. It is completely different. I do not enjoy the layout, the graphics, lack of user friendliness. I used to love watching the videos- now I have to hunt them down. I’m glad the app still exists which is why I gave 2 stars. But I have to tell you, some play games on their phones, look at memes, Instagram, etc. My 10 minutes of free time was spent on the weather channel app- not any more... it just makes me sad. Please let me have the previous app, bring the joy back."

620,LeonJon,"March 27, 2018",1,"POOR & MORE LIMITED REPLACEMENT FOR ORIGINAL THE WEATHER CHANNEL APP I was snookered into “upgrading” to this version 9.8.1., with the promise that it is an improvement for the original THE WEATHER CHANNEL APP FOR iPAD.  The reality is that the original allows me to have several cities, international and national, weather information, by simply swiping the page left or right.  With this version, you have one location option.  To see other location the search icon must be used.  Does not make any sense to remove this option, particularly if the app is used to help planning travel to various destinations.  For this reason, this version 9.8.1,  is to be deleted.  I’ll continue to use the original version, which provides much more productive information and functionality."
621,Nickname for Apple,"May 29, 2018",1,"Funny Money Gone? iPhone 6s Plus. Been relying on this app for a decade — well, except for their ad motivated “forecasts”. During the next hurricane, try checking their ad factored forecast simultaneously with their current local conditions, extrapolate for hyperbole, and you’ll get something usable. I think that I read somewhere that they were sold a few months ago for pennies on the dollar compared to their previous sale price. Lately, for me, the app isn’t working when it comes to changing the locations of desired weather current conditions/forecasts. A bad sign that goes along with this is that updates appear to be happening less frequently, possibly meaning that they aren’t keeping up with the API. Hopefully, things will get better —"
622,lisacoda,"July 27, 2018",1,"Do not get if you have limited data plan I’ve had this app awhile. For months I’ve been wondering why I run out of data and get charged overage fees when I’m barely ever disconnected from WiFi. I finally reset my iPhone data usage statistics and watched what happened during a long drive with my phone screen locked the entire time to pinpoint the problematic app. Look no further, this is it. After 90 MINUTES, The Weather Channel app had used up 700MB of data from my monthly 5GB. Just days into my current month and I’m almost completely out of data all because of this app which I’ve only opened once in the last week. Also, it’s not even that convenient for checking the weather. Too much scrolling around. Good riddance."
623,Wesanchak,"August 16, 2018",5,Weather Channel App I’ve always liked this weather app. It could be more smooth and sleek but over all it is very accurate. For a mobile phone unless you have more bars or higher speeds this app takes a while to load. I like that you can get weather for some cities on this app that you can’t get on other weather apps. I can’t even play the videos because I have very few bars in some areas on my phone. I use this app a lot for the weather and it’s one of the best weather apps.
624,Crusana,"August 30, 2018",1,"Please Change Graphics Long time weather app user here, going on 10 yrs. I just updated the app. Functionality definitely improved. Access to the information I want is laid out in a more intuitive manner. But the all white background and black text in similar sizes and weights has made it difficult to use. Makes it so hard to read that I’m going to have to use a different weather app (even though I paid for ad free) until fixed."
625,Sequoia Tom,"May 2, 2020",4,Tree guy I have used and liked this app for years. They have somewhat weather related videos now. In between every one is this rediciously stupid blaring loud volume bouncing child trying to sell something. Reducing my rating to zero stars if I could because of this. 
626,Cheers1050,"February 18, 2020",2,"bummed I have reported a problem for weeks and there has been no response.  I have paid for the premium Weather Channel monthly, but I am not getting the features.  I have reported it i know from several avenues at least 8 times and have received no response. I am so disappointed.  I seem to spend more time trying to get responses than actually using the app.  I will be waiting for for a few more weeks as I was just notified of being charged another month, but will cancel if nothing is done or I don't get a response.  Very disappointed!  I would give the app five stars when I can actually get what I pay for, but as of now it has to be two stars!"
627,Madhatr6699112,"February 10, 2020",1,"Too many ads now to function I have used you guys since the beginning and loved you — until the ads. I stopped watching your news pieces in the app when you made me wait to see things that could be immediately important to me. I used to watch quickly at work or between things I was doing. Now, I can’t. But I still used you for a quick weather check. Now, I can’t even do that. You now run ads so I can’t get between screens quickly to see my weather. You have destroyed the point of an app to check something that immediately effects us and our safety. I’m afraid I’m going to remove your app and go to another that understands the need for fast updates to the public to help them. Too bad. You were great."
628,Sunbear29,"January 24, 2020",1,"More steps and also still useless Latest Jan 2020 update continued the developers move towards optimizing this for phone rather than iPad type readers, adding more steps to get info and making it more difficult to check multiple locations.

The hourly forecast WITH the extended hours works great on my iPhone XS Max, but on my iPad Mini and my iPad Pro, the hourly feature does not work at all; crashes the app and returns me to the home screen on both iPads.  And yes, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app on both iPads, and made sure that I restored my Premium subscription on both as well.  Disappointing. I would have to assume that the developers are aware of this and will fix this issue in the next update?  Otherwise, great app; I just want what I paid for...."
630,Pas3x,"September 7, 2018",4,Update is horrible - second look Going to be looking for other weather app options after years of loyalty. Current configuration is just impossible to use at a glance. Boo
631,ScrappyMags,"September 30, 2018",1,Absolutely HATE this new version I give changes time and usually wind up loving them but the change to this app is AWFUL. Weather should be simple - open it and clearly see the high the low and what’s coming up. I shouldn’t have to put on my reading glasses to do that (I’m 43 FYI) or search to see what day? When will it rain? Where do I click for hourly? My visually impaired mom can’t even use this app any more. The print is so small now. When on the home screen I finally figured out I could swipe left to get the “old” look at the hourly forecast but you can’t do it from any other place. Barf. I hate it. Don’t even use the app. Now use the app from my local tv station. Oh and I also never leave reviews so that’s how much I hate this one now.
632,Nekko Santos,"October 2, 2018",1,"This update is affecting the significant weather alerts and it’s bugging me I enjoy using the Weather Channel app and I would’ve rated 5 stars but what I enjoyed the most from the past  was the real rain time alert and other significant weather alerts like the storm, rain, lightning, and snow alerts but for some reason the newest update doesn’t allow me to turn these features on. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that you no longer need a login or just the update it self is in need of some bug fixes or something. But until then I guess I’ll just stick to the regular app my phone bring since their practically the same, the only difference was the alerts which are no longer are available."
633,Sam3270,"October 5, 2018",2,Old version was better The photos and the background pictures are what made this app desirable for me to check several times a day. I liked when you had a sunny day showing hot air balloons or a stormy or snowy day on the app depicted with pictures. Now this version looks dreary and too plain statistical. I see no reason to open it and look at it several times a day like I used to. I’m very disappointed because the weather channel app was always something I looked forward to checking and even using on my social media posts with screenshots. I won’t be doing that any longer with this new version. I used to have a 5 star rating for you but now am indifferent.
634,Connor Mckee,"October 8, 2018",4,NOT User friendly! I loved this app and have used it for many years-Now DELETED from my phone.  This once was a great app however it has become way too complicated and a ridiculous amount of unnecessary information.  It was nice when you could open the app and see the entire week to begin with and then click on any given day to get more detailed information on that day if you wanted to. You could also easily scroll down and click on the radar map etc. No longer visually appealing and not at all user friendly.
635,VetLady,"October 16, 2018",4,"Disappointed I kept hoping that I would become adjusted to the changes in this app, it hasn’t happened. I don’t like to use the word “hate” so I will say I greatly dislike the update. The putrid colors and mostly white background are such a disappointment after the soothing blue and easy to read print that was there previously. I miss being able to see (and easily read) the information I needed at a glance. I’d love to be able to go back, I wish there was an “undo” option. The old saying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” certainly applies in this instance!"
636,deedle bug,"November 11, 2018",1,Awful! Time to delete? Adding to review: Still awful. I can’t easily find my saved locations. Small print with no color contrast makes it impossible to see. I need weather for several locations because I’m traveling across state and it doesn’t deliver anymore. My former go-to app is used less all the time. Hopefully I can get recommendations for a better app.
637,Piedpiper1946,"November 13, 2018",2,"Still The Best The new version for iPad 2018 loads slower on my tablet. It also crashes and the old one never did.

My iPhone X is updated with both the latest Verizon Wireless & Apple’s software. The new improved TWC update seems to cause a delay in loading the app, whereas, it was not a problem in the past. I click on the app & it just sits there (waiting to upload the latest information). It all started when Hurricane Micheal started to get some media attention. I don’t know if the server was big enough to handle the volume of users all at once or if the new update is just that big, but the problem still exists. I have excellent WiFi, all of my other apps work just fine."

640,GhostTechSupport,"January 18, 2018",2,Old platform better The old platform and motions to work the app were better until they signed on to contract with mapbox. The map is always lagging unpredictable and you are better off looking outside for real-time weather. You are unable to scroll through your locations instead you have to tap search then tap again instead of a quick flip left or right. Ads of course are starting to glitch out and automatically appear when scrolling down through the sections of the area. I’m sure there is more but the weather channel used to be an awesome app now it is just mediocre and they don’t care about the end user statistics.

643,TheFlyingTs,"April 2, 2018",2,"Location puts me off coast of Africa It’s a an ok app, but the latest update puts me off the coast of Africa when I open the radar map. I’m guessing it’s a programming error that puts me at 0 degrees latitude and 0 degrees longitude. The little inset radar map on the main page shows the right location and the forecast is for the right location, but the big map is broken. "
644,cwisniewski,"August 19, 2018",1,"Longtime user, now deleted I have happily used the app for many years along with other weather apps. This morning I noticed that the app was displaying a badge and thought perhaps that a severe weather warning was being announced. I opened the app and saw no such thing. Instead a out-loud video ad began running some 1 or 2 seconds afterwards. I am not in favor of my bandwidth being excessively eaten up like that for an ad. The app is free so if you want to make some revenue with ads, fine, but stick with static ads that take up no more than 10% of the screen. And I am definitely not in favor of ads that play audio—especially without my consent. What a bone-headed move, Weather Channel! I immediately closed app and then deleted it off the phone."
645,Dev7000,"September 6, 2018",4,"Frustrating update Not a fan of the new update. I like the idea of a clean, simple design, but in this case it’s made it so that I can’t easily see 1) what the weather is now and 2) what is going to be both today and in the future. The highs and lows for the coming week is particularly confusing: the font is the same for highs and lows and it’s hard to see which belongs to what day. Really confusing and I’ve found myself using the default weather app to check the weather lately because at least there I can get the information I need at a glance."
646,TobieB,"September 20, 2018",1,STOP WITH ALL THE FLUFF! Update over update your app keeps getting worse.  The recent one takes away the ease of getting information. 
647,Izzyb79,"October 20, 2018",2,"Hate the new update! This is my go to weather app but now I’m thinking of getting rid of it. Get rid of the bar graph! Just show us the highs and lows. Go back to when you open the app I see the temp, high and low, de point, wind, humidity, etc all right there together. I hate the tabs at the bottom. I don’t like having to search for the weather. I live in tornado ally I do not want to be playing hide and seek when it comes to weather. Please go back to the other layout. I was hoping this most recent update would have fixed it since you said you read the reviews and listen to what people want but it doesn’t look any different. May be time to find a more reliable app."
648,FireFly1111,"December 6, 2018",1,"Hate it. Can’t stand the new app, and I feel like I’ve given it enough of a go.  The “sexy” new layout is cluttered and complex and annoying.  I don’t want to have to “study” the new app - I just want to open it, and have it lay the info in the palm of my hand - seamlessly.   And because I dislike everything else so much, I honestly can’t be bothered to figure it out anymore.  I’ve tried checking back in every few months, to see if it’s gotten any better, but I hate it every time.  I’m still clinging to the old version, which I still have, thank God!  And that’s the one I keep coming back to.  Plus, the old, blue background is so much easier on the eyes when you’ve just woken up - who wants white?!?  Sorry, it’s a “fail” for me :("
649,jjbj,"April 9, 2019",1,Time to Delete I like many others just deleted this app.  I have a iPhone X and ever since I purchased the first iphone the week they came to market I have used Weather Channel as my first go to weather app.  I first added a radar app several years ago.  Weather Channel is resting on their reputation and not improving any aspect of their work.  Now they don’t list wind speed. Any human that has ever been outside knows there is a difference in 40 degrees with 20 mph wind and the same temperatures with 3 mph winds.  Weather is a scientific endeavor and like any scientific endeavor you do not get better outcome by concealing data.  I am beginning to believe Weather Channel just doesn’t have the knowledge to depend on to plain your and your families future to.
650,RacheEm83,"April 27, 2018",5,"Love it! I find this app to be easy to use and very accurate. I use it every Sunday to plan my outfits for the coming work week. I love how specific it is and how many options there are for viewing the upcoming days or even hours. I deleted the weather app that comes on my iPhone because it’s not nearly as user-friendly as this one. In fact, I was recently using my husband’s phone to check the weather and got very frustrated with all of the information it was lacking."

I can't set alerts anymore because it requires I select locations, and the ones I put in only show now as recent and aren't selectable, so, no more alerts for me. It also won't let me save more than five locations without bumping others off when I put a new one in. And I cannot believe the app only gave us five days to log in and ""save"" our preferences, which we could only know about if we happened to click on the link in settings that said Missing Profile. Unacceptable!  To top it off, the hemp files all refer to the old app that actually worked. Utterly useless! This was my go-to weather app. Now it's garbage. 😡"
652,WhoaVer,"August 28, 2018",5,Great heads up on rain I live in Florida and rain pops up out of nowhere practically everyday and this app sends a notification to your phone based on where you are currently located warning you that rain is coming and intensity.  It has been so helpful in giving me a heads up that now whenever I see a flash of lightning I’ll think “but wait I didn’t get a notification from TWC app?”.  Then I check my phone for unchecked notifications and there it is!  So awesome...I never write reviews but this one deserves the 5 stars!
653,Ggghhhjhddddduuuu,"August 29, 2018",3,"Why? This app had been great, but with the latest update the app freezes upon returning to it unless you're opening it new, and it abruptly closes/crashes. Very annoying that i cant leave the app running in the background and come back to it later. Additionally, i paid the fee to remove adds, $3.99, and after 1 year i had to pay again to continue my subscription. At some point it's going to become the most expensive app on my phone. At $4 a year that is too expensive, especially since the freezing issues. Please fix and the yearly subscription price might be worth it."

655,JoeCT521,"September 12, 2018",1,"In case of emergency, use another app On an uneventful day, the ads and pop-ups, frequent crashes and slow data loads, lack of text transcripts for breaking news video, requests to complete surveys and rate the app, dropped severe weather settings, and the convoluted new and ""improved"" forecast layouts are merely annoying and inconvenient. But in for dire weather emergencies when every second counts, there are far more reliable apps that offer quicker access to clear, easily consumable data and don't exact payment to remove junk that slows the transmission of potentially life-saving information. It's a shame really; I expect better from TWC. It's my trusted go-to source for weather when I'm near a TV. On my devices, though, not so much."
656,mrt_phd,"September 12, 2018",1,"New version is horrible Not only does it take forever to load, but when it does the display and information are far from optimal. For example, just trying to see current local weather is confused by the wavy line graphs that are prominently displayed, the app often crashes when you try to go to the local radar (which refreshes much later than weather actually happens!), and there are WAY too many videos (both weather and click bait) instead of just reporting on important weather. BTW -- since the app is ""powered by Watson"" one would think that storm tracks would be an available overlay.  I switched to this app (AND paid to remove ads) when Storm was taken over and destroyed. Sure do miss it!"

The new look and feel might be more modern, but UX is not as good. For example, no more quick summary of days (old app showed about a week’s worth of highs, lows and percent precipitation... now it’s about 1.5 days per screen and my thumb aches getting to a week out.

You had this option on the last version so if I wanted to use that I would have. Ease of access people!! You need to bring back where it shows the forecast for everyday all on one screen.

I liked the last upgrade because it gave a day-and-half hourly forecast, which was great for planning ahead.  I also liked being able to pick several cities on our travel routes to visit family as we would be traveling through the mountains and we needed to know the weather in the different areas we were going through.  The ease of those features seem to be gone.  Now I will have to work hard to obtain the information I used to be able to get at a glance.  I HATE this app now and may even delete it.

Support keeps telling me to uninstall and reinstall, which requires me to reset the app and restore the settings every time. What a waste of time. I like the content on the app but it just doesn’t work reliably. Edit. This is now a one star review as I’ve had to install/reinstall yet again on my 8 plus iPhone and it worked once then is dead again.

Taking advantage of this, the app is staffed with attempts to get you to watch there videos. This means that if you’re trying to listen to your own music or a podcast while you open the app, you now lose but you were listening to. It’s a relatively minor inconvenience to have to go back and restart whatever I was listening to, but it’s not like there aren’t hundreds of other weather apps for me to use instead."
662,Zeva11,"November 30, 2018",1,"Recent update Weather app recent update is going in the wrong direction.  Less to do with weather and more to do with ads and video content.  Over the last 3-4 updates Weather Channel app has been slower and less informative than the prior version. More time to load, more pages to swipe, harder to switch locations if you follow the weather in more than one location.  Fortunately there are other weather apps that have kept it simple, fast load times, straight forward presentation, with current weather information, and 7-10 day forecasts.  "
663,nodamidis,"January 25, 2019",3,"OK but used to be better I have two main beefs with this app.  First, the text and colors are so light that it’s really hard to see.  It needs more contrast.  Second, when I look at the forecast, I want to quickly glance at the forecast for several days but the app just provides the detailed view of the forecast and I end up having to read it.  It would be great to start out in a list view and if I tap on the forecast for one of the days, then I get the detailed view."
664,Unabirder,"March 3, 2019",5,"Very good This is now my weather go-to app for the iPad. Simple and with the right amount of data. Occasionally I want something more in depth, and use a different one. I would rate five stars if there were more videos of current weather."
665,UnityBrown,"January 26, 2020",1,"NOT PREFERRED AT ALL I have had this app for a very long time but now I do not like it respectfully b/c it keeps popping up to get Premium & it’s disturbing b/c it’s like to switch is being pushed & shoved on the customer-myself. I don’t at all like this & before the app did not ask for money to see a great forecast extended & now it is constantly popping up when one uses the app & it is quite bothersome-like the world today everything is about money & not service or people for that matter-the company is not going to care about my writings b/c it’s all about money money & more money-total dysfunction in government, companies & money-money-money & GREED has done nothing for the world at large or for humans except cause havoc that cannot be reversed. It’s actually very sickening-"
666,Gabriella R L,"January 6, 2020",5,The Weather Channel The Weather Channel provides realistic forecasts that help me throughout the day! I enjoy the updates they give us during every season. This app gives you accurate updates of when weather changes are possible or likely to come in your area! The app also shows you local and global weather updates! I would recommend The Weather Channel to anyone! The Weather Channel is a great app especially when you live in a temperate area!
667,Tim Soule,"November 28, 2019",2,"The app Let’s talk about the app... I gave it 2 stars because it’s not very accurate and the actual app function is a little sketchy. Case in point, when I open the app then select hourly weather it goes back to the home screen in a few seconds, doesn’t give you time to read the hourly. Same when I go to the radar portion , just goes right back to home screen. So.. they also want you to pay to look at more advertising to see past 36 hours of forecast, why? Aren’t making enough from the advertising? Please....  I can go and Google the weather and get 96 hours for free on a lot of other sites...  So, it’s an ok app, meets bare functions but nothing special."
668,Matthewray87,"June 23, 2019",2,"Meh Too many ads, the app is pretty slow and crashes on me a lot. The app is average at best to get a general idea of weather around you. They called for severe rain/thunderstorms ALL weekend, saw one pop up storm that lasted maybe 30 minutes. Granted it is June and weather is spotty, still think they over forecasted. Not a fan of the weather channel to begin with seeing as how they excite panic over fairly average weather. Look it up, they didn’t start naming snowstorms until the weather channel started in 2012 (for publicity). Since then, the sky seems to be falling every time there’s a little bit of precipitation. Personally, go with weather underground or a more local app"
669,Laguna Mary,"June 21, 2019",3,"Where are the clouds I’m a huge weather channel fan and have used their apps for years, Recent upgrades have cut back on showing cloud cover and fog even at 100 % percent opacity.   Living on the West Coast it used to be so handy to see how far the fog went in so that I could estimate when it might clear up"
670,Irritating 1000,"March 11, 2018",2,"Bad replacement! The old Weather Channel for iPad was great! It had some bugs every now and then, but it was beautifully designed for the iPad. Easy to read...simple...gave you everything you really needed right up front in easy to read large font with the most helpful info all on one page...temps/wind/forecast by hour all in one swipe. The new “replacement” for this app is like reading an eye chart...tensy-tiny hard-to-read font size, way too light, on a difficult background and WAY too much info when all you want is a quick update on weather. We are not all weather geeks! At the very least, increase the font size1 Better yet, keep the old version!"
671,JohnnyDrape,"April 21, 2018",1,"Constantly Self Sponsoring with Pointless Videos I would like this application to only have the weather, however it continues to show weather channel sponsored video options. I purchased this app to remove ads. Then I turned off video auto play, and that was not enough. The weather channel has become a false weather entity, it has fallen behind the times due to advancements in technology that fundamentally ruin its purpose, and instead of sticking to their guns and showing the weather and the weather only, they constantly try to bombard their customers with pointless videos about things I personally do not care to watch. I suggest removing the videos and letting me have just the weather information."
672,Urtinyfriend,"August 5, 2018",1,"Truly disappointed I had this app for a long time and even though it wasn’t accurate to the degree it would help me know at least cooler or warmer trends. I enjoyed all the other info it brought and some of the videos were pretty interesting.  But if I could rate it less than one star I would. Simply for this final comment. There was an ad that truly disgusted me. I’ve seen a lot of things on the internet but I wouldn’t expect to see something so crude I can’t even write it in this comment. I wrote them an email explaining more detail and they didn’t even bother to reply. I deleted the app immediately and got one from my local news channel. For this alone, the app should be rated for 18+ only. Truly disappointing for a weather app."
673,Dentrek,"August 17, 2018",3,Accuracy As a weather channel viewer I would have expected the IPhone app to be as accurate. 
674,Noshoes77,"September 3, 2018",1,New Beta is a pain. I’ve been forced to test the new Beta of the app and I do not like it.  
675,Gypseajules,"September 9, 2018",1,"New update is AWFUL.... The new update of this app is horrible. I get weather warnings sent to my cell phone, but when I go to open my app, they’re nowhere to be found. And though I have all my locations put in correctly, I don’t get correct conditions for what is currently transpiring in my area. The app just looks like a bunch of numbers, doesn’t flow well, and half the time, freezes up, or just gives a blue screen with the weather channel logo and that’s it. I’ve emailed the weather channel, I’ve left numerous complaints on their Facebook page, and have had no one even bother to contact me back. There are complaints all over your Facebook page about the new update to the app, but obviously you aren’t interested."
676,Flash hows,"September 13, 2018",1,"Not happy with the new update Boy did you make things more confusing, and I say this after giving the app a few weeks of daily use thinking it would just take time to be comfortable with the new format. Well, it’s not just the format, I don’t like it! You can no longer look at the 7 day forecast on your phone without having to swipe from left to right to see all the days with the high/low temp and percent chance of rain. You can only see 3 days at a time. Same for the hourly forecast. I believe you can only look at 6 hours with out swiping left/right to see more. Sometimes it’s nice to see the bigger picture. Too many adds, too many videos. The app was better before all the “enhancements”!"
677,Stevemen,"September 21, 2018",2,What happened Frost have been very displeased with the way the app has been reimagined. Maybe it’s part not liking change but I really miss the way the app was viewed before. Also the accuracy is very subpar. It’s frustrating that in a group of people using different apps and this by far be the most inaccurate part. Several time I e left the house with a forecast of and sunny and 80 degrees only to find a rainy day of 70 degrees. I definitely have downloaded other weather apps that I use to plan trips and how to spend my day based on the weather. This has not been a reliable source which pains me to say because I’ve always preferred this app to the others but no more.
678,Terpsikore,"February 8, 2020",1,App is ruined by major re-do The Weather Channel was the one weather app I really liked.
679,Cappyden,"October 27, 2019",2,"I Held Out.. and I will miss it I refused to upgrade the reliable IBM version of TWC app for iPad to the very end, now sadly its now gone so I had no choice. This new fancy version is too slow, runs like its on an Windows 98 IBM desktop and lacks the smoothness of the older version. It’s also a powerful tracking device to monitor your every move... no thanks. Sadly it misses the mark when it comes to even the basics, like HUMIDITY levels in the projected FORECASTS! Where are they? The new doppler radar maps look uglier and move clunkier compared to the original version. They should feel lucky I gave them 2 stars. This is not an upgrade, but a DOWNGRADE in my opinion.  It will be deleted and I will go elsewhere."
680,Youthette,"September 4, 2018",2,"Where’s the radar?!?! Though I like the overall look of the new version of the App I do not like that you moved the radar off the home screen. As a person who lives in Oklahoma and relies on immediate radar updates in times of severe and significant weather, I do not like that I have to scroll down through videos to get the critical radar information I need. When a storm wakes me in the middle of the night I want to be able to see the radar immediately when I open the app. Temperatures and predictions of rain are honestly useless without the actual radar. Please put it back on the home screen and make us scroll for everything else."
681,ftsweetpea,"September 21, 2018",4,"Updated Look I absolutely dislike the updated view and use of the app. I liked the previous look and it was much more user friendly, even the computer version stinks. The app is so light it makes viewing more difficult. I miss see the ten day outlook. I have tap and scroll to find just basic information. Where are the allergy reports and videos? I’m sure if I scrolled and tapped I would find them but who has the time. I like WC but the current version totally stinks. Bring back the color and make it less complicated."
682,99centsucker,"September 25, 2018",2,"New update brings you more unnecessary content and removes pertinent content The new UI for this app is so annoying. I just want the weather in a quick, easy way. Now there’s different tabs and directions to swipe. Oh and tons more videos to accidentally (or are forced to) click on when you all you want is a good radar map. But the thing that makes me write this review today is that you can no longer get data about atmospheric pressure. I have a chronic medical condition that is heavily influenced by pressure changes and the app used to help me prepare for what kind of day I was going to have. "
683,Jjhyu,"December 17, 2018",2,Last update made app difficult The Weather Channel app was my favorite app of all. I mean every thing on my phone. Lots of what my days and weeks are planned for depends upon the weather. I would check it faithfully every morning before I got out of bed. The new display has changed the background and the type face and has made it much more difficult to read and follow. The flip up screens are annoying at best. The inability to flip easily from location to location has been changed and cannot be done now. You had the best there was hands-down why did you have to change it? The only thing that remains the same and very good is the radar
684,okiedokiedorkie,"January 1, 2019",1,"Glitchy, laggy, unnecessary The app used to be fantastic. But ever since the supposed “beautiful redesign” the app has been absolutely atrocious. It’s such a nightmare to interact with that I’ve actually switched back to using Apple’s weather app. There’s this saying, “less is more”. Seeing hourly projections is a mess. Looking at the forecast over the next week, is just terrible. If I’m looking at weather projections, I want to see it all on one screen. Then the notifications! I’m constantly being alerted to having notifications. So I’ll go into the app, and lo and behold, there aren’t any notifications to be found. Anywhere. The previous version of the app with the background image, was exactly what everyone wanted. NOBODY wanted this redesign."
685,Jconss,"January 16, 2019",1,You may as well predict the weather yourself Youre better off living your life without looking at this app and just taking on the weather as it comes. They feed you crazy “breaking news” predictions that the next day will be completely different. Countless and i seriously mean countless like a good 80% of the time the weather is wrong with this app up until the very moment the weather is happening and im a person who relies on the weather predictions for my job. Weatherbug is more reliable personally speaking they at least dont tell you ur getting 2 feet of snow and then in the morning wake up with absolutely nothing on the ground and then u waste a day not making any money because you told your employees to take off
686,Bkh25,"April 29, 2019",1,"Used to be GREAT!!! I’ve used this app since it came out, but no more. First, it doesn’t reliably open when I want it to...why would I want a weather app that doesn’t open when I want to check the weather? More often than not I get the spinning wheel of dots at the bottom of the screen for minutes at a time. "
687,letting it all hang out,"September 17, 2019",5,It’s just the most amazing app I didn’t know what I was going to do from day to day hour to hour before I got this app now I can be confident that the nudist beach will be ready to bake me like a loaf of bread on sunshine dripping honey days. And then when it’s going to rain I like think I’m at Woodstock the original getting naked and slip sliding in the mud having free live everywhere and just sense of awe and wonder when I those bushes peeking out me as they drip fluids and rain. Man the glory are back and I owe it to weather ch app you are the best thing sinse sliced bread
688,mizzaka,"August 28, 2019",2,"Just A Continuous Ad for “climate change” Since ownership of this app changed hands a year or so ago, it has become nothing more than a continuous hammer to pound into humans’ brains that so-called “climate change” is going to doom us all. How wrong is that? Since the whole climate-change-is-the-fault-of-humans has been proven over and over again to be a load of garbage by responsible and truthful scientists, someone in charge of this app needs to get a brain overhaul. I’m tired of hearing the old and tired refrain. I give it 2 stars because the weather info, when I can stand to look at it, is useful. I’ll be looking at other weather apps to escape the attempted brainwashing over and over."
689,MrsMike921,"June 27, 2019",3,"Mostly good app but could be improved I like the app and do use it regularly, but find that the most annoying thing about it is it won’t retain the radar layers setting to show lightning strikes. So for every single storm we get, I have to go back in and turn on that feature in layers to see where the actual strikes are happening, even though the notifications from within the app are going off like crazy telling me there was a strike 2 miles from me! It’s really annoying that the feature doesn’t stay on until I turn it off. It should know my preferences based on my log in."
690,mmason1,"September 2, 2018",2,"New update When they first announced the new update I thought it was going to be a use friendly interface much like the last version. However it is the most confusing and irrelevant update ever. It did absolutely nothing to make the app better and instead of just opening the app, seeing what the temp is or the weather later in the day you have to dig for all the information you need. It doesn’t tell you anymore what’s happening outside anymore it just tells you what might happen. Coming from the app the would tell you to the minute that it would rain, that’s pretty frustrating. Definitely missing the old version."
691,hazeldove76,"September 6, 2018",1,"Disappointing Hot Mess I really hate to say it, but this update is a complete mess. I really dislike it so much that I want to delete it, and for the first time in the 9 years that I’ve had an iPhone, I will be looking at other weather apps. The pale colors and small font against the white background are very hard to see and the sideways graph is just honestly quite horrible. It seems like an annoying task now to try to look at the weather instead of something I always found to be quick and reliable. It’s really quite a bummer. From reading other reviews I’m gathering that no one really seems to be happy with this update and I’m hoping you’ll listen to the feedback and provide an improved update very soon."
692,ShelbyReyes,"September 26, 2018",1,"Not a fan of the new app design! I used to love the Weather Channel App (even preferred it to the standard iPhone Weather App), but ever since they redesigned it I find myself annoyed by the front page interface. I can’t even pinpoint exactly what I liked about the old version, but something about the new one is too busy and not pleasing to view."
693,Casskey1,"October 21, 2018",1,"Fixed what wasn’t broken The weather channel was never very accurate. However it was fairly accurate and was tolerable. Somebody just had to come along and fix what wasn’t broken by changing the entire format of the year and in doing so by the way reducing the type size Which is now 1/3 of what it was. They went from a very easy to view format to a very difficult format to read, including this new graph of sorts which I know there have any interest in nor do I understand how to interpret. I just wish they would’ve kept the original format and would have stopped making changes just for the sake of making changes. I finally deleted the app and went to something more user-friendly."
694,Arkie66,"October 31, 2018",1,"New update is AWFUL Like many others, I truly hate the new update! It’s not user friendly, difficult to navigate, and even unappealing color wise. I doubt this review will do any good, I’m hoping with enough negative feedback, you’ll make it right. I doubt it however, and will probably just look elsewhere."
695,DanT_2000,"November 5, 2018",1,Keep revising it I really have to question the developers sense of what users want and what they want. Have you been reading the reviews? At all? 
696,sgkgrtiobcws,"February 6, 2019",1,"New upgrade is obnoxious and useless I’ve used this app for years and I could open up and see the ACTUAL FORECAST. I never even write reviews but it’s frustrated me ever since the update but today we are expecting a winter storm and after clicking all over the screen for 10 minutes, I STILL have no idea when it’s expected to begin this evening. I have plans and I’m trying to figure out if I need to cancel or not!!  It’s ridiculous!  I have to scroll through some hourly graph just to see when it starts!  Nobody gives a crap what the temperature is going to be for EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY!!!  We just want to know what it’s doing and what it WILL do.  Ya know, kinda like...I don’t know... a weather forecast???"
697,#0805EmmaMurphy.com,"April 29, 2019",5,"Awesome The weather channel tells you everything you need to know about the day.  What you need to wear , when you need to put on a coat. Also if you are at the beach it can tell you if it is high tide or low tide.    It can also plan your day for you if it is going to rain then you can’t go horse back riding but you can stay inside and watch tv with your family.  This is why I believe the weather channel is the best weather app their is.  So get The Weather Channel, you won’t regret it!"
698,Jessica Ehrhardt,"March 25, 2020",5,My review The weather channel can alert you when a storm or tornado or some other natural disasters come in your area. It has saved my life at least twice from a tornado. One of the them was when I was with my family watching TV and then I git an alert that a tornado was coming 15 min before it happened. It gave us plenty of time to get ready and soon enough there was a tornado 2 miles away. I don’t want to waste your time reading this but I highly suggest this app.       - Riley Ehrhardt
699,Little boy's mama,"July 10, 2019",3,"Good app, minor annoyances I used to LOVE this app. I used it daily several times a day. My husband fishes and we used it to check wind speeds and rain chances for the upcoming day. Alone with the best times to head out in the mornings. Well - they changed something. Now they want you to purchase the “premium plan” to see past two days or hourly weather. That kind of defeats the purpose of me having the app since that’s the feature I used most often. I see others complaining about ads but I have never received an add. I wish they would throw on across the bottom and let me see past 48 hours now."
700,Glendale Paul,"July 24, 2018",1,"New format is terrible I am so sorry I upgraded from the previous ap. As far as I am concerned, this is truly a downgrade! I get stressed out every time I use it.

701,Turbo444,"August 17, 2018",5,"New app is coming I was prompted (through this app) to watch a video and give feedback on a new Weather Channel app that is not released yet. The app looks great, but I was especially impressed with the video experience. "
702,LG,"August 31, 2018",2,To Much Going On At Once! The Weather Channel App was my choice of weather apps.  With this new update it opens and looks like a monthly report loaded with a Bunch of unnecessary data.  
703,Laur Mary,"April 26, 2019",5,"Way better than any other weather app!! This app is way more efficient than any other weather app I’ve ever used. I find it’s much more accurate with the weather forecast/ predictions.... and it’s very easy to navigate. I also really like how you can have easy access to the radar, which is something I use often. I also enjoy how you can easily watch videos and the news. Overall way better than weather bug or any other weather app like that."
704,Rynobravo,"May 4, 2019",5,"I love this app😍 I love this app because it makes my life a whole lot easer I don’t need radar any more because it is on the weather channel. Perfect! It says the hourly temperature, the high and low for that day, it has the latest weather around the world. This is the coolest app it is so much fun. But I have a question for the people who made this app, who estimates the weather for do you guys or does someone else? And please have an actually person write back about my question. Thanks so much! "
705,mostlycoats,"February 14, 2020",3,"I’m just frustrated I mean.. like.. just.. come on, dude.. The app used to be fast, clean and reliable. I think I noticed the change right around the time Premium became a thing. So many ads. Maybe that’s what’s slowing it down, but I honestly think if you don’t have premium it throttles down efficiency. Bruh I get it, nothings free in this world but I feel like you guys could meet us in the middle at least. The Weather Channel used to be the good guy! Jim Cantore reporting inside a hurricane, local on the 8’s.. I know I’m not alone when I say we all miss the good guy Weather Channel. "

Finally, I did try to download the weather channel again, only to notice it has all changed now..  and you can get premium weather channel for 10 bucks a year..  ok, but I just want a nice weather app that doesn’t want to charge me for giving me the temperature.  Makes me frown now to see them on tv.  Now, they want to sell the weather..  I am beyond disappointed with the weather channel for screwing up a good app with one that is totally terrible!  I hate it!  And that’s the point I want to make.  The new app, the free one, is a piece of doo doo.  I deleted it."
707,chery1o,"January 12, 2020",3,"Not as good as it was When I select this app on my phone the first time it try’s to load but boots me out. So I try again and it takes forever to load. The new set up for non premium users obnoxiously full of in your face ads. I wish I could have it open in the order I would like to see the information that is important to me. Temperature, hourly, daily, the page with sunset, barometer, and humidity. Then videos. The only reason I keep this app is the information is so accurate I use to be addicted to the weather channel When my cable provider didn’t charge me extra to have it."
708,Dapper Dan 13,"November 21, 2019",3,"Not loving the IBM takeover I’m a bit disappointed with the new app under IBM.  The weather predictions aren’t very accurate anymore and they used to be spot on.  The app design in general isn’t super intuitive.  Just finding the daily overview is confusing as there is the main menu for “Today, Daily, Hourly” but to get more info you have to go to “Daily” and then click the graphics.  It’s a bit weird.  Also, no projected moisture amounts.  I can see the % chance but not how much moisture is projected to fall.  When you live in a snow state, that’s important info when planning your day.  Overall, I don’t love it anymore."
709,No Pop-up,"July 18, 2019",1,"You ruined a great thing I have used your app as my only weather app since I’ve used apps. What happened? First your accuracy went down. Way down. It was literally 50 degrees out and you were displaying 70. Also, what is with the new display? Why change it? Why is it white. You can barely see the details. It worked perfectly fine before. Why did you delete my favorites? I’m not even going to talk about all the extra stuff you have going on. Who ever took over and decided all these changes were good should be let go. Try again. Get more accuracy and make the display easy to view again."
710,Jmurinchack,"May 3, 2018",1,Another down grade My previous review is at the end. My current thoughts are that I had to delete the app because it no longer worked and couldn't be updated in my IPhone 5. I'll just have to use dark sky's because it works. 
711,N.Potts,"September 10, 2018",2,"App used to be accurate and then an update... Used to be my go to weather app. I travel a lot for my job and it worked great everywhere I went with accurate radar  capabilities. I completed an app update on both my personal and work phone, and now the radar freezes every time, even after closing and reopening app, on both phones. Its also way behind on where a storm actually is located. I thought it might be the WiFi, but I have tried it on 3 different WiFi’s and on my wireless network and the radar still freezes and won’t load or zoom in or out. Very disappointed in the new update and hoping a fix comes soon."
712,Trinity1128,"September 25, 2018",4,Whatever version I'm using please don't change it again!!! I'm going to please ask that the next time this app says I have to upgrade because it will no longer be compatible will be the last time I have this app. Whatever the version it was before this one was just awful... 
713,crystaltehgreat,"January 22, 2019",1,Advertising works against you I meant to leave a review for another app but accidentally left it for this one because of it’s advertising showing up first.  I don’t see a way to not leave a review now. Good job on your advertising campaign.
714,Jekah Rose,"April 5, 2019",1,"When it Works It’s a Good App I purchased the upgrade and still no improvement. More often than not, I can’t even access the app because it when I open the app it gets stuck on the initial blue Weather Channel screen and buffers. Literally stayed in that mode for over and hour one time and did not change at all. I just closed it as it was not viable. When this issue occurs, the only way to fix it is to delete the app, redownload it, and restore my paid settings. I am a metro commuter in Washington DC and walk everywhere. I use this app sometimes three to four times a day depending on the weather. It’s become so frustrating that I have started using another weather app. Seriously disappointed!"
715,Scottis2hottis,"March 31, 2020",1,"Keep getting less The weather channel app was really good but in recent years they have started to take away features that use to be standard. Why? To try to get you to pay for the premium app, which is over priced. Most of the features int the premium app are just especially functions that were standard like lightning strikes, storm tracking, more hour forecasting, etc. this has also changed other apps owned by weather channel such as the storm radar app. The weather channel app has become a money grab. I have also found that during this time of change and premium pushing their forecasts have become less accurate as compared to other weather apps. It’s a shame."
716,Naphneen,"January 30, 2020",3,"I hate the new update! I hate this new update! I used to have a list of locations on the old app where I could check the weather conditions for other areas of interest, or if I was traveling to find out the current and future conditions. I can’t find that anywhere on the app. Why didn’t you just leave it alone. It was easier to use and better. “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it!”"
717,Deeeebbbiiie,"January 2, 2020",1,"Disappointed I use to love this app until you all changed it completely. It’s never worked right since you updated it and changed the whole layout. It’s slow, crashes all the time, and quite frankly I don’t like how the new layout looks. I am writing this review today because now you all have got rid of the timing on the radar. When I press play it does not show the timing for the past and future. I am not going to pay just to get that feature back. I don’t even know why you would take that off. That’s ridiculous. I was trying to hold on and keep going with this app because that’s how much I loved it back then but I think it’s time for me to find a new weather app."
718,Ambarrett,"September 4, 2019",3,"Hurricane Forecast So let me get this straight, you can’t even give us a ballpark on when the hurricane is going to make landfall, if it’s going to make landfall, or if it’s going to even hit a state at all. But you are going to include a video of Trump’s map with another line on it. Then include that video as if it has anything at all to do with the hurricane forecast. All these people evacuated from Florida and Georgia........ nothing major going on. But please make sure that video is included with Trump’s wrong map. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m sitting here in Georgia panicked about family members close to the coast and this is what you considered news worthy!"

I don’t do anything for the day until I check this app. I used to watch the news weather, but I can guarantee 7 out of 10 times I won’t have my rain coat! With this app, I know when, where, and for how long! I wish this tech was here when I was younger 😀 The other thing I really like is I can look at any city in any state and plan a car trip and know the weather on the way! That’s a useful app! Can’t live without it! Thank you 🙏"
720,Mrbeast8476,"June 1, 2018",5,"Amazing job developers! Love this app I will admit it changes a lot (1 PM sunny 15 minutes later it’s saying for 1 PM Flood Warning/watch) it has its flaws but it does do what it is supposed to do. Love all the features (hurricanes temperatures in a area watches warning, ect) the videos are a great addition to the app as well. Overall I love this app I suggest this app to anybody but if you hate it then delete it! So great job developers keep up the good work and I know this is not cheep but try to make the radar system more accurate."
721,Queenof25,"July 4, 2018",1,"No longer going to use.. Loved the weather channel app when it was the old version.  Layout was easy and you could get ACCURATE weather at a glance.  The new version takes forever to load and the forecast/radar options all contradict each other and are unreliable. Example: dark clouds, thunder coming nearby:Forecast will show no chance of rain, “future” radar shows no rain, yet “past radar” shows rain coming in.  The correct version : the past radar and the sky was the winner.  I have been officially won over by AccuWeather.  Reliable on the first try, easy to get the forecast and ACCURATE.  Sorry Weather Channel, I can make a better guess at my weather than you can show. 👎🏼"

Also hate that I can't swipe for the 10 day forecast!! Anything past 10 days isn't really reliable anyways so $&@* your 15! I loved the stories to watch! You guys have destroyed what made you so unique and useful! I hate you for taking the app I loved and used everyday and destroyed it, I now have to download every other app and find the best fit for me, because TWC is no longer that app!! I hate the new update and if you bring back the old one I will come crawling back, but not until then!"
723,Smell that?,"September 1, 2018",1,"What in the world have you done??? This is by far the WORST update The Weather Channel has done.  It seems very cluttered and not sectioned.  While I’m sure they like the idea of all the weather sections flowing with one another, this makes it seem too confusing and overwhelming.  The one and only thing I like about it is the button at the bottom to immediately take you to the daily forecast.  However, the design aspect of the daily forecast at the top is ATROCIOUS 😫🤦🏼‍♀️.  The high and low line is awful.  It makes everything blend together and is not as easy to read as the old format.  Please, please... if you’re not going to bring back the old format, at least bring back some parts of it that people enjoy!!!"
724,J. Edmond,"September 24, 2018",1,"An Example Upgrade to Teach What NOT to Do The user interface (UI) is actually NOT user friendly (UF).  Like millions of people, I need glasses just to read up close.  The new color schemes do not present enough contrast, the font is too small and not able to be changed, and the display includes tons of white space unnecessarily instead of presenting useful information.  It is actually one of the worst UI upgrades I have seen that has reduced the presentation of information sought by users and did cosmetic changes that reduced its utility and instead frustrates people.  Really? The temperature goes up and down throughout the day? So I need a 1/2 screen graph with a thin little low contrast line while unable to read the actual temperatures?"
725,Petrapsych,"October 2, 2018",2,"Loved it until..... I was using this as my primary weather app and I loved it until the newest update. I gave it a chance, because changes always take some time getting used to. However, after using the new version for a few weeks I still did not adjust. It’s not laid out well and too much going on at once. It has a lot of distracting info all at once. I feel like I am having to analyze and look for info carefully now, whereas before, I could just open the app and see the info I needed. It has this continuous stream of temperatures highs and lows with a line that connects them. I’m sure some will like it, but I’m having a hard time with it."

And it all used to work fine until this new design update was released. Since then, if ever try to use the app without ads, it doesn’t launch. It will load, and load, and load on the splash screen forever and never launch. But when I remove and re install the app it is fine. Then when I restore my ad-free purchase, it’s back to the same thing. It’s really unfortunate because I love this app, but until it’s fixed I’m having to use other services to get my forecast. Please fix this ASAP!"

I can live with ads for a free app, but there is so much crap on every page that you can’t find the weather. The interface is horrible and all of the superfluous information on the screen just makes it difficult to find the forecast. I literally cannot see what is happening the next few days from any screen. I’ve been hanging on for a months hoping that the next update would bring improvements, but I’m out. There are so many weather apps available I’m going with something else. I’ll check back in a few months to see if anything changes with this disaster of an app."
728,H0tel? Trivago,"May 21, 2019",1,"Why are there high ratings This is the worst app I’ve used! This does not deserve its popularity. It’s says it’s raining a few hours in a row and then 2 hours later there’s no rain! I once got a notification that it was going to rain on and off for 10 minutes. I was supposed to walk to school and immediately I asked my mom to drive me. Since she was still getting ready and there wasn’t any signs of rain she told me to get an umbrella and walk. During the whole walk there was only a few drops of water, not even sprinkling! It could’ve just been the trees being wet from earlier! I do know my city is huge and it could be different other places, but they could always use zip codes or exact location."
729,Josh deason,"May 21, 2019",1,Dangerously behind My issue is not with the update but rather how up to date the radar is. We get tornado warnings and I’m looking at the radar and the storm is still five miles out. But it’s pouring rain out. Then in the midst of said storm it’ll show that its here. Then when the rain stops the radar says we are in the middle of it. The radar feed only updates maybe every ten minutes. I’m sorry but if I get a tornado warning and I need to use radar to see if I’m in danger and it’s five minutes behind that’s my life my families life that’s in danger. Tornado sirens are unreliable around here. I need to know exactly where the storm is right now not five minutes ago. Pshh weather underground’s radar updates faster than yours.

You would think why not just change the settings, right? Well I’ve went in the app at least 15 times already and changed it, and I keep getting these notifications so I go back in the app again and it’s turned back on! I uninstalled this app because I’m tired of messing with it! Also wouldn’t be that bad if it didn’t give notifications from every single place I’ve been to. I tried turning them off for everywhere except where I live and that didn’t work after trying so many times then I turned off all notifications and they are back on again!"

732,NMerCle,"April 2, 2018",3,"Trying too hard I downloaded this app in order to receive severe weather alerts. Living in Indiana, it’s important to be warned in the night of tornadoes and straight line winds. Everything was good for several years but now suddenly within the week, I now get alerts about weather around the country and minor things like rain beginning in 30 minutes. It seems my only option is to turn off notifications all together. Not helpful and annoying. I can’t just turn off the sound notification, because I need to be awakened at night for severe conditions."
733,NewStart2017,"April 3, 2018",1,"Alerts killed this app for me Just removed the app after years of use. The sudden decision to override your alerts setting is an annoyance. 5 to 10 times a day for the past 2-3 weeks my phone gives me alerts that in my opinion have very little connection to reality. Unless a zombie apocalypse is happening, I don’t need my phone to yell at me if it’s slightly foggy 20 miles away from me. Several times I have turned ALL notifications off thinking it’s a resolution and magically they all turn right back on again. Well the phone has woke me up in the wee hours of the morning with an alert of mist in the air too many times. This has been my only weather app since the iPhone 4 but now it’s time to say Good bye!!!"
734,Dr.Bernhardt,"April 25, 2020",3,"This was a great app, now no more I used this app for a long time. The data was reliable and the app was good quality. There was always advertising and that was fine with me. Recently this went south. The app is trying to sell the premium version like crazy and the quality of the app is therefore going down for general users. Function don’t work anymore, ye get disrupted when looking for a thunderstorm and it even becomes borderline dangerous to use this app nowadays. Overall you are much better off when you get an app from a local news station. This one is no longer useful."
735,BofA Customer 76,"April 11, 2020",5,"Auto Video Play Overall, this app is pretty good, but the autoplay feature for the videos is beyond distracting. It's very difficult to read the weather forecast when an extraneous - often silly- video starts running.  I would give the app 5 stars if I had the option to disable the annoying auto video feature."
736,koala428,"March 4, 2020",1,"Premium Subscription Not Working- No Response from Support I usually don’t leave negative reviews. However, I have tried to email support several times as well as report issues through the app with no response. I purchased a year subscription to Premium in December. I was able to use the Premium features for a little over a month then it went back to the basic/free account with ads. Every time I use the app, I get a pop up to subscribe to Premium. I have tried to uninstall/reinstall the app and restore my purchase. I have also verified my subscription is still active.

Then one day it was dead. Had no choice.  Had to get current one a few weeks ago.  Was trying to give a little time to get used to it.  Well now it is apparent that everything about it is slower than before.  Have to tap several times on anything I want to bring up.  Then it is so slow.  Don’t even like the format as well.  All I want to do is get hour by hour, day by day forecast many times a day (because forecast changes so quickly sometime), as well as view of the radar currently and in motion.  All very slow and annoying."

739,NYT_Guy,"January 3, 2020",1,"As if it could get worse ... Ha, ha ha. I just had to laugh when I noticed tonight that they are now inserting a huge ad in between *each and every day* in the daily view. Completely obnoxious. There must be someone employed there whose sole occupation is to ask, “How can we possibly jam even more ads in this app?” Even worse, it’s the same ad. So like I see the ad after Wednesday and I don’t clicked but, hey, by the time I scroll past Saturday I may just be enticed to click, right? The only thing I can think is that advertising isn’t nearly as lucrative as subscriptions so they intend to infest the app with so many ads that some people will pay the subscription fee just to flee the horrible experience. What a sad business."
740,Gdguylrstct,"May 24, 2018",1,"Worse with every update. Why even bother ? I USED to like this app very much but every update has made it WORSE, not better.  Stick to basics without all the useless junk. Leave well enough alone and stop updating !!   Last update this week made the app not even load anymore !  I may try deleting the app and re-installing it to see if that will help but wonder why I should WASTE MY TIME on their problem ? !!   ( Using iPhone 6 btw.  ).    These updates are ruining the app.  Probably time to just forget it and use something different.   Example.. used to just swipe to change locations. Then with update needed to go to a list to choose.  More of MY TIME wasted.   It’s 2018 and we expect better than this !"
741,MonsterCan,"July 9, 2018",2,"New Design is Awful This update ruined the app for me. It erased all of my locations, which would have been irritating, but forgivable, except that I can’t stand the look of the app now. The design now is truly awful. It is less intuitive and harder to navigate, and it uses blocky, characterless text that is unpleasant to look at and hard to read. The picture of normal, decent text shown in the preview here is of a previous version. Last gripe: with TWC’s track record of inaccurate 10-day forecasts, it was irresponsible to start offering even more fantastical forecasts as far as 15-days out. I might as well just call a psychic for the amount of good it does me."
742,Drus1298,"September 1, 2018",1,"Horrible redesign They’ve turned something that was straightforward and helpful into an unusable mess.  I open it up and it’s this bizarre graph where you’re looking back and forth — I’m not scientist or a math person, I just want to see the weather at a glance.  And when I go to daily to see the week ahead it’s this bizarre squiggly lined thing where I can NOT tell which day is which.  Finally, they have made everything into this tiny type and light on a light background where you need a magnifying glass to read, doesn’t seem to be any way to enlarge it.  You know someone “clever” in their 20s designed this makeover, no thought whatsoever to the average person that cares about weather and needs something usable."
743,kk00ll00mm00,"October 7, 2018",1,New look The new look gives you confusion at a glance. Nothing is clear and concise like it used to be. The graph for the high and low temp is not defined as a daily high and low so if you live someplace where the weather can fluctuate dramatically in a day (which many of us do) then you lose track of what day you are looking at.
744,Ariel M J,"March 13, 2019",1,Not worth downloading Honestly this app fails regularly. I have spent 10 minutes waiting for the app to load and actually open. This was while connected to a wireless network and then trying again on my phone’s data. When the app does manage to actually open it typically crashes before I can even find out what my local forecast is. Just stick with the weather app that comes preprogrammed on iPhones. At least it’s reliable with actually loading something weather related. 
745,Battsman33,"December 23, 2019",1,"Annoying and spams with useless notifications. Doesn't honor settings Please stop sending alerts for things that are not turned on. I had been receiving dozens of spam alerts that had nothing to do with me or my location or weather for any location I have ever accessed in the app. So I turned off everything but government issued alerts because I only want to be notified of the National weather service issues an alert in my area. But periodically the app automatically turns on alerts I had previously disabled, and even if it doesn't it doesn't honor settings and still pops up with notifications for alerts that are disabled. Pretty sure this violates Apple's quality standards and I'm sick of it."
746,Earonik2,"December 19, 2019",1,"Customer Service? Lost $9.99 I’ve used TWC for years. The now ad-invaded format led me to update to Premium, even though I wasn’t happy about the cost. Unfortunately, after several attempts to upload Premium, I never got it but the app clearly shows that I paid for it and it’s good through November 2020. After myriad attempts to contact the app developers via links & emails, nothing has been resolved. I’m out $9.99 and have NO UPGRADE. I finally sent an email to request a refund and have yet to see any action. I’m keeping the app to see if Customer Service exists and if so, has any interest in helping me. Communication so far has been impossible, hence this negative review. If this can be resolved, I’ll revise my review."

The first is watchable then the one below it won’t be. The loading for the radar on iPad is also really slow. I think the iPad version is just broken. The videos don’t work like I explained and the radar takes forever to load. IT IS NOT MY INTERNET. My internet is fast. The indoor mold thing doesn’t work. It says if the temp is bellow 96 then you are going to have mold problems. 96 degrees is ridiculous. You can have your air at 70 and not have mold problems. This needs to be fixed.

Trying to load the week’s weather takes forever!  And I have to search all over to find the basics!  It used to be so easy to find the forecast.  Terrible now!! Bring back the old version!!

750,Future Gym Owner,"August 29, 2018",5,"New update Is terrible Why did you change the whole face of the app. It is so much more complicated. Before you opened the app and scrolled down a half page and saw everything, todays temp, 5 hour forecast, and 5 day forecast. Now you have to click around the app 4-5x times just to see all that. No one cares about graphs. They just want to know what the weather is and what it’s going to be. You should give people the option to go back to the “old” version."
751,angelawr77,"August 29, 2018",1,"Ugh The new version of the app actually makes simple information harder to digest. Visually I guess it's appealing in a minimalist sort of way, but it completely ignores UX best practices. When I look at the weekly forecast, it is incredibly difficult to distinguish what data is associated with the day and the chance of rain percentage is so small that it's practically unreadable even on my iPad. Did we forget that when people scan information that the quickest way is in a list? Give people visual cues that they can distinguish one ""day"" from another and yes, use more than tiny all cap letters to do that. It's so bad overall that I just deleted it. I've been a fan of TWC for years, but this is just an egregious disregard of your audience."

Now it is right at the bottom of the app on a tab that can be accessed anywhere within the app. I also find the app to be much more responsive, and snappier. Thank you for this update!!"

Also when they show the daily or week trend flow...i cant tell at first glance what temp aligns to what day. They should have made each day visually stand out differently.

Update: now it’s up to 90% of time app won’t open, opens for a second and crashes, blacks out the screen. The few times it does open says it cannot connect to internet altho all my other apps have no problem. I paid $3.99 for no ads. A waste of money since I can’t see anything, even the weather.

The three circle summary at the top shows different information than the larger ones at the bottom. Hard to plan & prepare when I have no idea what to expect.

For example, the forecast will show 10-20% chance of rain for the entire day and then it starts to rain and it will then report 100% chance of rain. They don’t forecast, they merely provide current weather OBSERVATIONS. You know what? I don’t need an app to do that, I’m fully qualified to make current weather OBSERVATIONS myself."

I don’t like the timeline going from past to future rather than having the option to choose one or the other, and the “now” spot often shows the first “future” slide, requiring me to manually try to move it back one notch to see the real radar image.

The videos are so unnecessary. We have so many other sources and outlets for videos. I can guarantee that no one is going to the weather channel app to watch videos. I’ve been holding off deleting the app hoping you would go back to the way it used to be in providing the weather in a visually pleasing and quick way.

It instead gives this crappy wave graph that is basically meaningless.  I haven’t seen anything that could be called and improvement. In fact everything I have seen is down grade.  I have been paying to remove adds but you can count on me not doing that again, as this app is no longer worth it.  I will be looking into other weather apps immediately."
771,Dhdjsixjensxxxxxx,"August 29, 2018",5,My go-to Yes there are ads here and there as that's how stuff gets supported and brought to you for free. That being said it's easily ignored. The app is constantly improved and the in-app notifications are pretty accurate. If it tells you rain will begin in 12 minutes I have to say...it's nearly to the minute that it rains. I work outdoors and travel all over and the weather app works for me anywhere I've gone and it's as accurate as weather reporting can be.

The daily forecast with both highs and lows is not easy to look at. If you are thinking about accessibility and moving your thumb up and down to scroll that is much easier than pushing a button at the very top of the screen to toggle daily/weekly forecasts. Will most likely be deleting soon unless they change the update.

779,Rrdock79,"January 24, 2019",2,Hate the updated version I agree with everyone else that when this app was revamped it ruined it. Everything is harder to find and there’s too much clutter. I’ve also tried to turn on alerts but no matter what I do I always get a pop up saying I can’t turn on alerts at this time...to try again later. I keep trying and I always get that message. Apparently there is a glitch. Please go back to the original interface. I don’t understand why companies feel the need to constantly update something that is working so well to begin with. So I am now looking for another weather app unless this one gets better!

I kept my son home from school because the weather Channel told me that we were going to have over a foot of snow during the night. The snow didn’t actually start until nearly dismissal so my son stayed home for nothing. We ended up with about 5 inches. The weather channel kept changing it’s snow totals. Very unreliable

When I click on the radar, there are no storms currently visible on the radar. When I play the futurecast, no storms are shown whether it’s 10 pm or otherwise. But other times, the radar works, but the futurecast and the time when storms are likely aren’t the same time. They can be a few hours apart. There’s something desperately wrong with radar. I use the radar app I had to purchase for a real idea of when bad weather may strike.

What I find really annoying are visualizations for the sale of visualizations when a simpler and denser presentation of data is easier to read.

Gosh I do love Vivian Brown, and I equally dislike this new terrible & useless app. I have always considered my Peachtree buddies as the ‘Standard’ for weather news production and science, but you obviously got someone who NEVER uses weather data to create this piece of worthless coding.

827,D. Hill,"October 27, 2019",4,"The Weather Channel The Weather Channel Application is a good source for finding out the conditions in your area and any other you put in the search for. The app allows you to see the daily conditions, an hourly breakdown as well as the week’s forecast. The app provides even more data to this information for those more interested and educated about outdoor conditions. The app also provides articles regarding weather, nature and related topics. Users can also view video from the channel itself."

It automatically turns on notifications that I do not need in the settings menu. I contacted their support section via email and got it automatically generated email back that they would look into the issue but never heard back from technical support. I do not need unnecessary alerts going off on my phone.
830,GabeSV,"July 11, 2018",5,"Great app! But a little issues here. I like this app a lot! But there are some issues about locations and sometimes lies about weather. Bristol is not necessarily in New Jersey but very near though. Just change the state to Pennsylvania and add Township to the end of the name Bristol. Another issue: Every time I read the forecast, it says, “Chance Thunderstorms” or “Severe Thunderstorm Warning” but they’re lies. Maybe you could hire some more Storm Trackers and then things can be fixed. Thank you! 😊 ⛈"

The developers and execs here missed the point: weather is (used to be here) and always should be something you can reference quickly and only if DESIRED should the viewer/user be able/need to delve deeper.
837,ll luke j,"October 14, 2018",2,Latest update lacks I miss having a quick visual of the week in the app where you could see 5 days at a time (horizontally) with hi/lo temp and precipitation %. The new format is just too complex. Too many word. Not a quick view of the numbers. We are just checking weather so we can decide on activities and clothing for activities each week. It’s too many taps to get what I need. I have to go back and look at previous screens to put it all together. I don’t want to be bothered to hold things in my memory as I use the app. I feel I gave myself fair time to get used to the update but I still haven’t found the update helpful.
838,spy games,"January 7, 2019",1,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP Thought this app was great for years, but it has declined significantly. It can no longer give me accurate weather information for my current locations, even though it NEVER stops tracking your location. You can turn off location tracking completely, or have it so the app only uses your location while in use. Yet I find this is not to be true. The app continuously keeps tracking locations long after use of the app has ceased. I understand privacy in this day and age is not likely, but it sure would be nice if they could at least give me the accurate weather information/locations, that I know it tracks. "

The second issue is when the radar map is zoomed in or out the radar will not load, sections will be missing or it takes a really long time to show up. I do not think it is too much to ask for an app to work. Please fix these issues. They have been going on way too long."

I loved the app before, but I really like how they added so many different things to the app. Things that now a days with climate change happening, are important to know. I love how they added a hurricane, a health and activities section, and I especially love the air quality section. That one impressed me the most. I like how they give you the details of how the air quality is. Overall I just love this app, and am very thankful for it."

Since I had to upload the new version it has been nothing but a pain!  Slow to load, gets stuck on a previous day and won’t load, can’t get the radar to work, etc.  I even uninstalled it and installed it again thinking it may have been a fluke.  Still horrible.  Then I rebooted my iPad thinking that was the problem.  Still no better.  I finally went to the App Store this afternoon and found a better app and will use it for a few days before deleting this Weather Channel app.  To bad that something that used to work well is a failure now."

Problems keep occurring, you get a standard response email that they received your email but may not get back to you because of the high volumes of emails they receive. Really!  I’m paying for add free and yet I keep getting ads.  I’ve contacted the developers several times to no avail.  I’ve deleted and reloaded the app to see if that changes anything....NOPE!  The app takes way too long to load now because there’s too many ads moving, loading, videos loading, blah, blah blah!  I never been so disgusted and disappointed with this app.   If you don’t want aggravation, don’t load this app at all.  They have one month more before I pull the plug on these boobs!"

But now they are making this huge push to make you have to pay for premium to get features that used to be included for free and they have loaded down the app with ads everywhere!  I mean they put an ad in between every single day on the ten day forecast section. I mean like really?  Is that really necessary????  Everywhere you look in that app, there’s an ad. Y’all are fools if you think people are going to pay monthly for a few extra features and to remove the ads. People are just gonna delete your crappy app and find something else."
846,Twonbrown,"January 2, 2020",2,Not worth the trouble even for free anymore This used to be a decent weather app a few years ago. Then they tried to make it too fancy and it got harder to get the basic info you want. Then they started adding full screen pop ups to try to make you pay for the premium version which was so annoying when you just want a quick look at the weather. And now the ready already inefficient view of the daily forecast(which is always wrong anyway) now has flashing ads between each day. 
847,Italian espresso,"December 3, 2019",2,Great... when it works The problem used to be that it froze (on my iPhone 8). Now they fixed that.

850,High zen bird,"September 3, 2018",2,"New format update I think new design is difficult from a casual user standpoint. It’s not easy to just glance at and understand what’s going on for the day. The wave temperature line is definitely not needed. It’s hard to tell what day your actually looking at because they are not divided at all and just blend together even though the day and night is shaded different it could use some clear definition between days. The old format was much simpler and easier to figure stuff out at a glance. A weather app should not be designed for people to stay in and spend a lot of time on, it should be quick, easy and accurate period."
851,Terry K.,"September 5, 2018",1,"Horrible update! Just a few days ago, i LOVED this app. It was ‘neat and tidy’, organized,  easy to read, and very ‘to the point.’ There were extra things like videos, ads and stories that you could watch/see if you wanted, but they did not overwhelm the main focus of the app. However, This last update is absolutely horrible & probably the worst update of any app I’ve ever had. Please make things the way they were. I certainly don’t mind updates as long as they make the app more visible and user-friendly. This update is cluttered, hard to read & to follow. Just to see the next few days of forecast takes 3 clicks!! I’ll be deleting this soon if it doesn’t change."
852,klynn44,"September 13, 2018",1,"Awful update! The weather channel has always been my go to weather app. I USE to love the simplicity & ease of finding the daily and extended forecast.... that’s until the latest September 2018 update changed everything! Now- it’s just a confusing jumbled mess with wavy lines, numbers, & too much writing. The new colors are not very pleasing to the eye. This update does bring the convenience of easily going between the radar, daily forecast, hourly, etc at the very bottom of the app....but that doesn’t fix the fact that everything else is a mess. I’m struggling to get use to this new update, so I might have to find a different user friendly weather app until this one improves!"
853,stupid to need nickname,"September 28, 2018",1,"Revisions made this unusable This used to be a useful app.  The current version is so much worse as to be virtually unusable.  In the previous version it was possible to set up multiple locations and swipe through them, an important feature.  The previous version display was clean and easily read at a glance.  The current version is confusing and difficult to understand.  It seems like the new and “improved” version was changed just to be new rather than to be user friendly.  Please make previous versions available or redesign the new version to display as conveniently as the older version.  Until you do I will not be able to use this app."
854,Silverpurkat,"October 17, 2018",1,Terrible Update I used this app on almost a daily basis especially when I travel I setup and save the cities I’m going to so I can plan ahead. Now it seems you don’t have that option to save locations any more and the layout of a weekly forecast is gone too where it’s scrolls vertical then horizontal. The stark white background and layout is terrible too. I take my phone to bed with with and the blue backgrounds and pretty weather backdrop is gone too.  I have been with this app for 4 years and now I’m at a crossroad of going somewhere else. I will give you the end of the month but if you don’t ar least make the backgrounds less stark and more soft lighting then I will leave.  Thank you

I press enable and press the specific location I want, when I press the back button it shows off for everyone of the alerts that you are able to have. Please fix this issue immediately. If there was an option to give zero stars I would because this is very important to a lot of people and they don’t have this feature. I would seriously think this is a different app and not the weather channel because there known for showing us weather but they don’t have time to fix the app. This is definitely not the weather channel. And if it is, there really needs to be changes."

I wish I wouldn’t have updated it. I’m going to give it a couple more weeks & if it doesn’t change for the better I’m deleting it for good. I can’t figure anything out on this app because there is so much random garbage everywhere. I’m not sure if they’re even giving weather information on it anymore. It’s the only app I’ve ever used for weather, but I’m so disappointed I’m probably going to try something new. If the goal was to lose long time users, they should consider themselves successful. It’s hard to even give it 1 star."
858,Fins485,"March 10, 2019",1,Terrible redesign It’s as if a computer designed the app.  No thought given to how people actually  use or view things.  A graph for the day’s temperatures is ridiculous as an opening screen.  Most people want to open it up and get a quick look at what the weather will be for the week so they can make plans.  Now you have to go to a separate screen and scroll down to view the weeks weather.  Lots of ads and useless pictures and graphics everywhere taking up precious screen space that could be used for useful weather info.  Don’t use it much anymore.  Moved on to another app that was designed to give me the weather in a user friendly fashion.
859,arcticcircle906,"May 18, 2019",1,"Extremely slow, volatile and frustrating This app is extremely slow. I’m sure this is in part to the large ads that it needs to download every time the app is refreshed. The radar takes forever to load. The app crashes a lot. The worst part is the constant reloading of data if you lose focus from the app even for a split second to check something on another app on your phone. There should be user settings that allow you to set the length of time away from the app before the whole thing reloads. But of course this probably happens so they can load a fresh set of ads. I think I’m going to look for a better app, even if I have to pay for it."

I count on it for my work as I sometimes need to schedule outdoor activities and it really helps a lot in my part of the country where there are many microclimates within close proximity. Wherever the metrological data is coming from, it has been fairly reliable in its projections. The app itself has almost never or never crashed on me either."

I have attempted to report the wrong location and wrong location name, but despite making the corrections, it seems impossible to actually report the problem or correct it. This issue results in me getting poor forecasts and I don't get the same alerts as others with accurate location detection.  I keep my location service on all the time, so this is not the problem.  Other neighbors complain of the same issue."
863,Discontented,"August 29, 2018",1,"Old version was much easier to read I hate the new update. The old version was much easier to read! The 3 main things I look at: today, hourly, and daily are crammed into some tabs. Daily has some sine wave nonsense for highs and lows which us distracting and the actual weather pictures (sunny, cloudy, etc.) and chance of precipitation are so small, you can barely see them. It’s fine if all you want to see are the highs and lows, I guess. Before I just had to open the app and scroll down to see all that info. I didn’t have to tap anything; everything I needed was right there. And now when I scroll, there are minorly useful things like air quality and videos. Hated hate, hate it!"
864,Ms Fits,"August 29, 2018",3,"Not a fan of the new format!! I’ve been depending on the Weather Channel App for a number of years and liked the way the information was presented, but not so much with the new format.  I can’t get weather at a glance for the week (or 2 weeks) at all now, and this was one of the ways I used the app.  I realize that weather 2 weeks in advance is not entirely accurate, but I travel and this gave me a snapshot of what I could expect in general at my destinations so I knew what to pack.  What once took a few seconds now takes entirely too much research of the site.  Please fix it!!!"
865,Sandra Mimi,"February 19, 2020",5,"Weather channel IBM I get a complete idea of the weather each day, every hour has temperature and forecast, so I can ideally time when to walk the dog.

I am happy with it. There are weather videos and a lot of other things pertaining to the weather."
866,Cambell251,"February 13, 2020",1,"—-> It’s a SHAME <—- What happened to you guys? You used to have the best overall weather app period. First, y’all started gradually increasing the in-app commercials. Then, out of nowhere- somebody had a genius idea to make it beyond difficult & a major hassle for everyday people to check their weather with y’all.. That is- unless they choose to pay your stupid “subscription fees”. Greed will bring y’all down unless you find a way to return to your roots. As for me- I’m done with y’all. There are way too many much better alternatives in the App Store to go to & not get robbed. Don’t y’all have enough sponsors on tv, etc to make a profit? (Especially during hurricane season). I’ve said enough.... Good luck"

The App Store says this is for iPad, but it looks like an app designed for a phone. Too many steps to get to an easily readable screen. Go back to the old version & offer it for iPad users & leave this one for phones. I only downloaded this because the old unsupported version will no longer work. With the older version it was very easy to check the weather in other locations when planning a trip, especially when driving. I will try other weather apps in the hope of finding something better. This one does not work for me."

On top of everything else being cluttered instead of a nice, clean screen, the extra ads are perfect! I especially love how there is the same exact ad after everyday when looking at the 15 day forecast. I truly loved seeing that I can lose up to 20 pounds in 4 days! The only thing more impressive is getting an equally reliable and accurate weather app without all of the irritating ads. You guys really did go all out for us this time, didn’t you? 😂👎"
869,Wrbellsugar,"December 30, 2019",5,The Weather Channel app! This version of the app took many features away that the old one had. In addition it takes too long to start up after launching it. I’ve switched back to the older version it is much easier to use. I have noticed that while trying to view radar for saved locations on my phone the app will crash. Hopefully this issue will be addressed when the app is updated
870,Sconnors1101,"January 28, 2019",1,"Latest update is not good- I’m switching Find another weather app if you want to know the weather forecast. I loved the old version of the app!  I could get a snapshot of the forecast without having to search for it.  Easy / simple. However this latest version I can’t see the daily forecast - all I get are pictures.  The alerts that pop up don’t say anything at all - just that there is a warning. For example - I know we have bitter cold weather coming this week and I have warnings popping up on the app, but they are blank. NO WHERE can I see what this warning means or what is coming. I’m not getting what I need from this app, so much so that I am going to find a different app."
871,WellBeyondRage,"March 13, 2019",1,"Doesn’t open anymore. Why did I pay for this? This app used to drive me crazy with all the commercials in between the videos and how long it would take for the radar to load. So I went ahead and paid the five bucks for the app and those issues went away. Unfortunately they went away because the the app itself now never opens!!! It just spins and spins and spins and spins on and on... This is extremely frustrating especially for a weather app where time can mean life or death when you’re in tornado alley or when there’s a severe thunderstorm about to roll through my neighborhood here in Texas, and I can’t get the weather because the app won’t open. Awesome."

As a conservative that is also aware of the sensitivity of climate control I respect those ideas but also want to be respected by not ever hearing my President or Political Party disrespected by a Chanel that should be non partisan.  I do believe we should all do our part I. Not polluting the atmosphere. It has to be done step by step one small law at a time. Stop with the constant climate control or I will join thousands of others and just stick to local news outlets. #fairness #balance
873,laurengbd,"May 31, 2019",4,"Great layout, too many ads I love the design of this app and think it tends to be more accurate than other weather apps. It had a big redesign a few months ago and I really liked the changes. Downsides are that it crashes often when I first try to open it, and loading is often delayed because of the ads it has running. It will also mute what I’m listening to when I open it - I think maybe also because of some ads that are trying to play? Don’t know."

I prefer to ride my motorcycle to work every day and the weather channel app lets me know if I’m heading into sunshine or rain. (The bike stays is in the garage when it’s raining!) I often use the radar to make sure I will get home in time to miss a storm. Fantastic app, use it every day."

On an earlier update you removed them all and only put the last five “recent” places searched. After writing and requesting to be replaced and multiple people complaining, you put them back in much to my delight. However, now you’ve removed them again! Please put them back!

Weather Channel is clueless about West Coast weather, but I know that ant take their 100% chance of rain predictions with a truckload of salt...not infrequently 100% ends up being either no rain, or just a trace. BUT the big problem us that as soon as I upgraded, all of a sudden I was being completely assaulted by ads. I HATE ads!!! HATE them. I specifically won’t buy products that assault me online with ads. This “updated” app did not any benefit, just the highly unpleasant and irritating barrage of ads. Looking now for a different app with all the functionality and no ads.

878,Graynbushy,"August 31, 2019",1,How a weather app should be So most of the time people would like to look at the weather is before and during bad weather. With that said when it is during they might not have WiFi so when you put adds in there every 5 seconds it takes forever to get the information that could be life saving forever to download as well as cost data to look again for any new information. Stop selling out and just provide the service like you should. Also if you try to watch radar it takes 10 mins to load even on WiFi. It’s only a matter of time until you’re replace which I hope happens soon for the sake of people in need.

And unless I am missing something the weekly forecast where you could see the whole week at a glance is nowhere to be seen.  Who wants to scroll through a detailed description of each day just to see what the week looks like.  I will be looking for a new app.

The latest redesign from a few weeks ago seems poorly laid out with small text and limited information on the main page, in what one may guess is an attempt to make room for more advertising and increase the app’s number of clicks. After several years of actively using this app, I believe it is time to find a new app with comprehensive weather information immediately available on one or two straightforward screen (the current rendition has seven pages)."
885,JMerc71,"September 12, 2018",2,New 10.0 version I have been using the Weather Channel app for years but I am very disappointed with the new 10.0 layout. It looks very generic & more complicated to navigate. I miss the 15 day outlook layout. The new layout makes it hard to distinguish which day it is because of the day and night temperatures and rain chances. I have given myself time to get acclimated with it but I just find it hard to quickly glance at the upcoming weather like I used to. There is way too many videos and advertisements that make it even more complicated to navigate. I will be looking for another avenue to get my weather.
886,courtney rain or shine,"October 22, 2018",1,"Please Change It BACK!!! This update has Ruined my life!!... to a degree. I can’t retrieve info I need at a glance like before.I am force to hunt for the weekly forecast and the icons for rain or sun do not stand out enough. When I try to scroll through the days they run together and the daily’s pop up by accident when scrolling through my the confusing week. My needs are simple, I want to open the app and be able to see high/low temp and if there is rain, sun or clouds for today and the next couple days right off, at a glance, pronto! Then have the radar below for quick reference. It could be so easy!! I do not negotiate with terrorists, change it back or I am outta here!!"

I had tried it out on another iPad when it first was first released last year and found it wanting. I had hopes that it would have improved, but no such luck. Still a jumble of little windows requiring clicking and more clicking just to find basic information. "
889,cema239,"January 29, 2020",3,"Way too many Ads...I just want to look at the weather This app is great content wise, but over the past few months the platform has ramped up advertising on the app. No, I don’t want to buy premium no matter how many times the pop up appears. Ads before the videos should be 10 seconds MAX - there is nothing more frustrating than having to watch a 30 second (or longer) unskipable ad from PG&E or a drug company. I get that ads generate money for the company, but over saturation is going to yield less and less consumers that will use the app."
890,IIIITSOTSI,"September 11, 2018",5,"Replaced All Other Weather Apps I replaced all other weather apps with this new Weather Channel update. It’s the smoothes and most user friendly. Very easy to see what you want. Since I can’t find a feedback option in the app, I’ll give it here. There should be a graphical representation of precipitation. Also, we should have the option to show temperature on Apple Watch face instead of weather conditions. Other than that, the app is awesome!!!!"
891,FruitCultist,"October 29, 2018",1,Vital Info Missing or Wrong One of the primary reasons I used this app was because they had live UV readings. It would tell me how strong the sun is. As a pale person and skin cancer survivor living in Southern California it is imperative I know how strong the UV is so I know what additional precautions I need to take at any given hour. Please re-add this feature in a future update! I don’t understand why this was dropped.
892,TheKillerdove,"November 14, 2018",2,"Previous version was better I prefer to get a full screen summary view of weather when I open app. The graph view with a huge ad banner might be nice for statisticians, but when I want a quick view of what to wear today in Texas, it is useless. I need to see the actual current temp, current feels like, hourly summary or perhaps a list of what the temp will be in 4 hour increments. In North Texas, the weather can be 40 and cloudy at 6 am and a sunny 75 at 3 pm. I need to know if I should wear layers, bring an umbrella, etc. And I don't want to swipe or change screens to get that information. Sorry, but this is no longer my go-to weather app."
893,River 66,"November 28, 2018",1,"Is there no fix in site? I used to be a regular to the paid Weather Channel app. I keep trying to embrace the new version with its graph presentation, but it constantly freezes and I’ve grown tired of deleting and re-installing. My question is how can a brand like the Weather Channel keep an app as dysfunctional as the current version available, especially to paid subscribers? The last update is 3 plus weeks old. It didn’t work well previously, and after the latest it still doesn’t. All I know is I can expect a spinning dial indicating its loading, a blink, and it closes never to be able to open unless I do the uninstall/re-install thing. "
894,gtffooh,"March 14, 2019",3,"Why? Well you used to be able to see watches and warnings on the radar but apparently not anymore, what is this friggin classified information now? for some of us truck drivers and everyday people who don’t get a chance or have the time to sit in front of the TV and watch the darn weather channel all day to see whether we’re under a watch or a warning and where they’re at would be very helpful and useful, Are used to be this way why not now? Why the change? Change it back to where you can see severe weather watches and warnings."
895,marlysofmull,"May 12, 2019",4,"Doesn’t load most of the time I really like the app when it loads. Most of the time when I tap on its icon it flashes The Weather Channel symbol and then it disappears and just gives a blue screen and never loads. Occasionally I can go into my other weather app and tap on The Weather Channel icon in it and it will take me to this app and it will load but usually even that ends up with the same not loading result. It’s frustrating and makes the app pointless. Yes, my app and phone are updated."
896,MMLS1514,"May 15, 2019",4,"Severe Weather forecast concern I’m trying to figure out why what I heard on the Weather Channel today, torcon 6 and hail etc for Friday, doesn’t match what the app is telling me. It just says chance of a stray thunderstorm. I checked the Storm Prediction Center and another weather app thinking and hoping maybe the forecast drastically changed but they are still saying severe weather is likely. I don’t know what to think, either this app is ahead of the game knowing the storm threat is downgraded, or it’s an app I shouldn’t rely on for accuracy."
897,Coho444,"January 12, 2020",1,Used to be good Congratulations on sending most of your users looking for a new weather app. Slow load times and constant add screens just to get whether have made this a useless app. The revenue from all the ads will not make up for losing all the customers. Worst Ux Ui I’ve seen in a long time. Fox weather authority from fox 2 is much better and easy to navigate. They also don’t make you pay for information that is maybe accurate 50% of the time. Trying to charge for information that is widely available shows lack of understanding you’re market or even basic marketing techniques. You are about as good at marketing as you are predicting the weather. Lol
898,cheaptrick84,"December 31, 2019",1,This app gets worse with every update! The weather channel used to be a simple tool. And it worked! Every time this app updates it gets slower and they throw more ads at you (probably why it’s so slow now)
899,App.User.2,"November 6, 2019",4,"Please update the Apple Watch App UI They’ve put so much work into the UI of the app but haven’t touched the Apple Watch app. I’d like to see updates to the UI of the Widget and Apple Watch App. Preferably, these would mimic Apple’s weather widget and Apple Watch app. I want to see the temperature on the complication rather than the chance of rain, or at least be able to change it like other weather apps. I’d also like hourly and daily weather on the watch app. Look at the stock weather app Apple has for the watch and follow that model."
900,hrg1219,"March 31, 2018",4,Great app The old weather channel was getting a little ehhhhh I kept getting reminders that I should get the new app so I did it is a lot better. When I checked tropical cyclones instead of just the category it is the wind speed direction of the storm and the pressure. The future snow accumulations have more options
901,Neeliemom,"April 1, 2018",4,"Wrong location I love the app, I think y’all have the best radar when I’m keeping track of storms. I just wish you wouldn’t insist I’m in another city. Can’t you go by zip codes or something? You keep telling me I’m in Windcrest which is five miles away and the other side of IH35 from me. Nice place, I just don’t live there. I’m in San Antonio. When I try and report a location error the app just shuts down. I’m going to have to turn the location off which is really annoying. I’m just tired of changing forecast cities."

904,DjWysh,"August 30, 2018",1,Once upon a time I loved their old app. It was exactly what I wanted. Simple weather not much else. The stopped supporting it and made me download this instead. I wasn’t happy about it because it took longer to load but it did offer more detailed info so it wasn’t terrible. Then the last update came and now it takes forever to load and the info thy now offer seems to be in less detail than before wit the added bonus that it is now more difficult to read. There are other apps out there that care if you can read the weather as well as giving you what you want instead of focusing on content rather than the WEATHER. I’m done with this trash.
905,Shred 1,"September 1, 2018",1,"User-unfriendly Very disappointed with the latest version 10.0.  All-white background is way too bright, even with phone brightness turned down, Night Shift doesn’t help, either.  If you want to check on a storm that is rumbling through in the middle of the night, open the app and bam! you will now be awake for a while after the app lights up the room.  There is no setting to change the background or theme, as with certain email apps and other apps, to a darker color.  Previous version = 4 stars, version 10.0 = 0 stars (if that was allowed), since for me the app is unusable.  Deleting the app and looking for another weather app that is user friendly."
906,Othy1018,"September 3, 2018",1,"Version 10.0 is bad I have used this app for years because it was straight forward and easy to navigate. I liked the 48 hourly forecast, and the 15 day forecast. "
907,mishkalove,"September 10, 2018",1,"I hate the latest version I’ve always enjoyed using this app. They recently changed the layout of everything and it’s just too much. I liked the old ten day forecast where I could easily see the temp and likelihood of precipitation. It changed day to day but I could quickly and efficiently get in, store the info and get out. Now there are graphs and highs and lows for each day and it’s all the same color scheme without a big enough divide and it all just morphs together and is not very friendly on the eyes. If I’m getting ready for work I want to just glance and see what I’m working with for the day and the work week. This newest update is not it. I don’t even want to use it now."

They spam you with “alerts” that are only somewhat related to weather and leave a notification dot on the app even after you swipe the notification away. Then when you go into the app to see the “alert” you just cleared for the non-weather event, you can guarantee that will be the time they spam you with yet another premium ad. We get it, you want to make money with your app, but there are tasteful ways to do it. The weather channel does not use those tasteful ways."

I can read about the hurricanes on your website or other news, but I don’t need another video update crapping up the other stuff. (No offense to those who need the updates. I just want an option.)

To watch any video related to weather or news there is a ridiculous ad that you have to watch before every single one.  There videos are only a few seconds each but your forced to watch another “ buy this” ad before it.  Enough already! I’m poking for weather and information - not ads on what to buy.

New version is hard on eyes, for a kindergartener, and visually boring. I don’t want to see endless screens of white pages with a few black letters of weather info, nor have to drill down to see info readily available before. The only movement, color, or interest is focused toward ads that now take up 1/2 the screen. If you like window shot of a blizzard or 1ft slab of Antartica background with cartoon images, then this white out is for you. This loses focus on true weather lovers and heavy users.

It’s very user friendly and has settings I can personalize. I highly recommend this app.

I just wish there was a way to rearrange the order of information in the app. That would prevent scrolling through everything to find what you’re looking for. I also wish that the widget had more information such as feels like temperature and upcoming rain and lightening notifications. I live in Florida where the weather can change quickly and I like to have all useful information at a glance on the widget.

He won’t be able to easily switch between cities because you can no longer swipe from one to the next and I guarantee just trying to get the forecast for a few days out will throw him for a loop. And the spots to change from daily to weekly are too small for someone who has essential tremor. Guess I better look for another app that is easier to use as an alternative for him.

I have been working as a vision professional for the last 20 years and can say that in my professional opinion, this latest version of the app is a visual nightmare. Having vertical and horizontal scrolling on the same screen looks messy, and having different options for daily and hourly at both the top and bottom of the screen also looks messy.

So please fix the problem and try to add the tornado radar for the app and you don’t have to but it would be helpful and great. Thanks!

I’ve only experienced one issue with the video player : when you play videos in full screen (at least on iPhone) and a commercial starts to play, there’s no way you can exit the video player but by closing the app. You guys should fixed that somehow annoying problem! Other than that, it’s a very accurate app with very useful notifications about the rain or next day temperatures!"

Apple billed me for the monthly upgrade charge several days ago, but I’m still getting commercials on the app. Again, I upgraded to avoid commercials slowing down the app during sever weather.  When you are facing a tornado, you don’t want to wait for a commercial to load before you know if you are in harms way."

However, now when you go into the app there is an immediate blocking ad that you need to click to get out of the way and then the main weather info is now no longer front and center and requires  a swipe to get past the ad to the main info.  THEREFORE it is not feasible to go in and out multiple times a day as I need additional  actions to get weather info.  Sorry time to go elsewhere!"

They take up more screen space and are larger in size than the actual weather info, which has been boxed in hard-to-read ever-shrinking screen space. This has been a relatively recent change. In addition, now when you open the app you’re greeted with a full-screen ad to purchase a “premium” version of the app, which you have to click out of before getting to the actual weather page."

No one wants to scroll down to have to see the weekly weather outlook. Isn’t that why the weather report on the news shows it vertically? The home screen looks like a math chart, not a weather report. Did anyone bother to do a beta test with actual people, besides the developers, to get feedback prior to making the decision to ruin this app? If you are a new user, don’t bother, look elsewhere. Unless there is a change very soon, the weather channel app will no longer be on my phone. This is a sad day."

The previous version was much more comfortable visually, it gave much more detailed information (especially more extended hourly temperature forecasts for each day), and it was much easier to navigate. Unfortunately, I’m going to download another Weather app now and delete yours.

I am compactly fed up with this app. This is my second review and now I am giving it 1 star compared to 3 for hopefully having an update to save me as s customer but have failed to complete this. I have been woken up twice by thunder showers that I wish the app would have told me about at 5-6 in the morning. One of them ended up being a tornado warning and the app never told me till I opened it myself. Maybe one day this company will listen to me and fix something they present to work.

I’m seeing many complaints/negative reviews with the newer version asking that the original version be restored and I’m with you all.

963,SEOhio,"June 3, 2018",1,"Went From Usable To Not Worth It Liked this app when I first started using it 3+ yrs. ago. Each update made the app worse, from slow loading, to freezing, to no radar function of any kind (this is particularly bad on weekends). The slider bar for the radar feature takes up the lower 1/3 of the screen so that it blocks the user from seeing that region without having to move off your crosshair location. Bad video design - drop the rule of thirds. And the weather forecasting has gotten really bad - not accurate - if I want to know the weather I can just go outside. I even paid for no ads thinking that perhaps I’d get a better layout. Really disappointing."

I’ve used this app for years and I can honestly say it’s worth the ten seconds it takes to download it. Ads are everywhere, just a fact of life. If that’s all I could complain about I just wouldn’t say anything. It’s no reason to knock stars off though! Get it, you’ll be glad you did."
965,Awfulydispoint,"August 29, 2018",1,Ruined! Since you have changed the app info to only include info for runners. And not allergy sufferers. Or those of us who have lung conditions. I am deleting your app. I depended on you daily to know my limits for the outdoors. Now with your new app it’s a mystery. So I guess you have to be an athlete to meet the new weather app standards. What the heck! Yes weather reporting is foremost. But part of that reporting should include breathing conditions! Good bye Weather Channel. Everybody has to change and improve when things were fine the way they were. For some reason you think if you don’t change your apps they are outdated. You did NOT improve. Now you just offer less. Won’t be back.

Every hour I check and it says ""storms starting next hour"" and every hour I check it gets pushed back. This has been happening for the last 24 hours.

I am so angry you changed this app. It was my go to weather. I enjoyed the videos & getting updates! This awful design is the worst design I have ever seen.

To include all the extra “junk”, why not link to a secondary app and bring the old version back for the simplicity many, most, too many of us really liked and appreciated?!? As of this morning, the app won’t open - it tries, but simply quits after about 5sec. What the heck?!? I deleted it and will reinstall from the cloud, but I doubt it’ll work; and even If it does, I’m sure I’ll still hate this new version."

One of the few things that is frustrating are the ads before every video segment, often it is the same ad playing on what seems like a loop therefore more annoying.  I understand sponsors and more importantly funding makes the app better but limit to once a day or even once per session, not after every...single...video. Other than that no issues."

I turned them off again this morning after receiving an alert while I was sleeping that woke me up. Later in the day I received another. No matter how many times I turn these alerts off, when I get another one and go into the app it shows them still on. Annoying!"

Or ""this newly discovered insect is causing harm to unborn infants."" Over half the time the headlines aren't even weather related. It's just toxic. I know news is normally negative, but gimme a break. It's the weather, and I live in Ohio, I already have enough bad weather in my life. I don't need any more negativity. Shame on you Debbie."

Now it takes forever to load (in some cases it never does and has to be restarted), is hard to navigate, and seems to be overloaded with things completely unrelated to the weather. I get that they’re trying to set this app apart from other weather ones and push more people towards their brand, but it’s seriously annoying to feel like I’m looking at a marketing campaign when I just want to know how hot/cold it’s going to be. The radars are trash too. I wish they would load, but they rarely do. Honestly, simple was better. Probably going to delete this app, it’s just not worth the headache."
974,Salavain,"April 23, 2020",5,Great app but the ads are brutal I love the app. It’s well built and the information is usually spot on. Even the videos they recommend you are worth the watch. My only problem is that the advertisements they have send you through a bunch of different pages and it ends up in some weird spam site so don’t click on any ads. At least other apps send you to somewhere respectable. These are just garbage.

You know, it would be GREAT if you could add a feature to where when I get weather alerts from the app, they’re spoken in Jim Cantore’s voice. That way when I get the notification telling me I have to drive an hour to work in dense fog with the visibility at less than an eighth of a mile, I’m more okay with it lol."
976,1999 suzuki grand vitara,"December 26, 2019",1,"Features moved behind paywalls With the introduction of their subscription service, this app has been moving useful features behind the $10/year paywall. In the most recent update, they tout the implementation of “future 48 hour snowfall” as a new feature. This has always been in the radar portion of the app, but now you have to pay for it. Little things like this will add up over time, and I wouldn’t be surprised if simple thing like seeing the 10 day forecast move behind this paywall too someday. If you’re going to purchase a weather app, just get Dark Sky. At least that is visually pleasing and isn’t spamming you with pop ups for ad revenue."

Started out on the original app.  Then you offered for us to pay a ONE-time lifetime fee of $5 for the weather channel max upgraded app.  Then you guys take that away.  Now you guys want to charge EVEN MORE yet again ($9.99 per YEAR recurring) for the advanced features that in my opinion I ALREADY PAID for when I purchased the Max app.  I’ve seen too many senseless changes and will be using a different weather service even though I’ve been loyal to you guys for years.  If something isn’t broken... don’t fix it.  I ALSO DON’T APPRECIATE THE CONSTANT POP-UPS PROMOTING THE PREMIUM SERVICE ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAD WEATHER CHANNEL MAX SOME YEARS AGO THAT I PAID EXTRA FOR.

Go to the gym later (one mile from my house) and it starts raining when I pull in the parking lot. I open my weather channel app... it STILL says 0% chance of rain... WHILE IT IS RAINING.

After two weeks of this I’ve finally decided to simply delete the app. It’s pretty sad, since the weather channel app has always been a staple on all of my iPhones. But I shouldn’t change my notification settings every single day, just to have them changed without reason or my permission."

Now when you try and see the current radar and then view the future it no longer shows exactly what’s on the radar moving.  It shows what they predicted it would do, not real time.  So we’re at a softball tournament and trying to see if this storm cell is moving towards us or skirting is, but the radar makes it disappear in future mode.  It needs to go back to showing REAL weather moving.   Disappointing.  Looking for a new weather app."

Now it cannot be found so dropping this app for the same reason others will likely flee, too; forecast weather accuracy that’s marginal, at best, (two weeks? How about two days?) and a focus on spending more effort on videos/commercials and changing user interface to keep up with ?? than providing easy to locate weather data."

You took out all of the nice features and added CRAP. What’s with all the graphs that just get in the way? Please go back to the old format. It was clear and efficient. This new format is difficult to navigate. And the 15 day forecast at a glance is no longer at a glance. This new design is awful. Look at all the reviews in the internet. Everyone hates it. Listen to your customers and bring back the features we loved. Otherwise you’ll lose a lot of customers who will be looking for another weather app that’s easier to use. That includes me.

Now the various bits of germane information are compartmentalized being replaced with ridiculous wavy graphics that serve no real purpose aside from satisfying app makers’ misplaced view of aesthetical value.

1063,Lioness011,"May 23, 2018",1,Buggy! Want the old version back!! The nice ability to be able to scroll and see all the various locations that I had set up under my saved favorites locations is now gone and I am left with a very on user-friendly app. Now if I want to see other locations I have to git the magnifying glass to find the location to go to it. I set my locations up in a certain order based on the map and they keep resetting themselves every time I go in to change to a different location. I am very unhappy with this latest version!!! I think I’ll go back to using AccuWeather which seems to be more accurate with their forecast anyways.
1064,Emarald city,"June 19, 2018",1,"Not accurate and overloaded with ads I thought this app was pretty darn good! But all the sudden every time the app says it’s going to rain and be 72 degrees, it doesn’t. This app is wrong about almost every time it “predicts” the weather. And no it’s not because “Mother Nature is always changing” because if they can determine which clouds have heavy rain, storms, snow, etc... but they can’t ever tell when it’s going to rain?! And sometimes this app says “SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING 100% CHANCE” but nothing ever happens the whole day and no storm clouds are in sight. "

Weather channel app developers you’ve done a great job keep up the good work
1066,Amina Smiles 4ever,"March 21, 2020",5,It’s the best Before I would use the Apple weather app and loved it but once my father recommended this app I didn’t see a need to have the Apple app anymore. This is a great weather app with many different things to keep you updated. I love the options for weather notifications since you never know what the weather is in the Midwest. The notifications are great when it’s rainy or snowy. All in all it’s an amazing app.
1067,PNWCustomer,"March 18, 2020",2,"Disappointed in the ads change I love the layout of the weather information in this app. It is my favorite option for how to see weather information. However I loath the change in how ads are done. They are now front and center of where I look for information, blocking my view and are frankly ugly to look at. It is infuriating to click a link to go somewhere and have an ad pop up instead of where you are intending to go. Please invest in some user experience consulting and find a way to accomplish displaying ads and having a good user experience. Please."

I’ve used the snowfall prediction maps to help plan several big trips including a cross country one last month that went super smooth.   However, I was shocked this morning when I tried to access the 48 hour snowfall prediction tab on the radar and it told me I now had to pay for premium to view it.   I get adding new innovative features and putting them on premium, but when you take existing features and suddenly make them premium only, I’m done with you.  Deleting the app as soon as I submit this review.   Goodbye."

I have all my notifications on for this app on my phone, yet it won’t let me turn on the notifications within the app to be able to receive them. Very frustrating and not worth the waste of time to check the weather on it. It can say no chance of rain and bright&sunny outside so I’ll get ready accordingly and then I open my curtains or door and guess what? It’ll be pouring down rain and be 30degrees. So awful. Absolutely despise this app."
1073,SpencerS90,"April 26, 2019",1,Less than one star. I used to love this app and solely used it for my weather needs. Since the update it has went down hill tremendously. I'm constantly experiencing crashes and it typically won't load on the first attempt. When it does load it gives me the weather for the wrong location or it doesn't actually load and just spins. I eventually have to force close it. It's too bad we can't have the old app back. It worked flawlessly and was great overall. Then they updated to the new layout and ruin everything about it. Give me the old app back and I'd update my review to 5 stars. Same with everyone I know or have asked.

However, the 30 second ads for a stupid game called “Township”, with the most annoying music/noise before almost every video is beyond ridiculous.

TWC advertising department should be ashamed of themselves. "

1077,BDH100,"July 8, 2019",2,"Greed Expecting me to pay for an extended forecast is nuts. The weather channel’s entire business model revolved around giving great information for free and monetizing the service via ads and such. So I have no ethical qualms with charging for removal of ads. But now... now they demand that we pay up should we wish to see detailed info on the extended forecast. Something they’ve offered for free for as long as I can remember (many, many years). "

The new interface is not intuitive at all. The old saying ‘if it ain’t broke...’ applies to this. Why would you take an awesome app and try to make it more difficult? I hate everything that has been done to this (and I’m an Instructional Designer, who believes in making learning simple and strait forward). I’m hanging in here for now, but I won’t go ‘premium’ and I won’t recommend this to anyone. Sorry developers, you dropped the ball on this one."

I thought I would get used to it but I hate the view of the “daily” weather it all blends in together and it honestly takes me longer to read the forecast, especially when I want a quick glance. Also I have noticed the UV index is gone.. I used that daily in the summer months. Anyways I still love the weather channel app but I’m thinking of switching... sorry for the negative review I just figured an honest response would be wanted. "

I am alerted before rain falls, and was always updated on any new movements before Florence hit my hometown back in October.

The Weather Channel has replaced my local WECT Weather application indefinitely!!!!"

Furthermore, for whatever reason, when I’m on WiFi I can’t get past the splash screen half the time.  I’ve tried contacting support, but that still wasn’t answered in a timely manner.  Frustrating.  You’d think someone could make a decent weather app, but instead they keep trying to reinvent the wheel by making it an octagon because - oooh wow!  Isn’t that neat?  No.  An octagon makes a terrible wheel that is kludgy as all get out."

I use to really like the National Geographic Channel until they got caught up in all the reality programming hype and a lot of it is lame trash. The weather channel was my go to app, but now you have to wade through a lot of unnecessary fluff that it gets in the way just like what happened to NG. We have limited time and only so much brain band width. I not a fan of auto video planning which some times pops up an steals my attention away from my main reason for going to TWC.  Keep doing what made you guys great in the beginning."

If there is an actual weather event that you want...you know...updates on this little gem will not open. Sort of frustrating. Seeing it’s the weather channel. For getting weather updates. During weather events. 
1089,Ken3317,"January 18, 2019",2,"Won’t load & crashes This app takes forever to load. I’ve been a huge supporter of the The Weather Channel for ages and have told many friends to get it. But it’s failed me 99% of the time the past 3-4 months. I click on the app and it takes so long to load in comparison to other apps regardless of whether I’m on WiFi or not. Lots of the time it crashes and just exits out on its own, too. If you can get past that, get it as I always feel what they report is accurate. If you can’t, search for another app. As a user of this app for years, it’s time for me to move on."

Have deleted and reloaded app twice now.  Also, this new app doesn’t allow me to scroll from one saved location to the next like the old one did.

There is way too much going on in this new updated version. Why do I need to see the rise and fall of the temp each day and night. I can read the numbers. I don’t have to have a line graph showing me when the temperature is going up and down. If you are going to do an update, start small and see what kind of response you get. Don’t completely revamp when you have something that is great. I wish I would’ve never turned automatic updates on and could've kept the old version because this is awful."

I’ve been using it for almost a week, and I tried the beta too. Seriously wants to make me install apples weather app. New daily forecast is so bad the way you swipe right, I’m constantly checking rain or otherwise. The trend line is so dumb too, who really cares. I live in Chicago and weather changes constantly but I can tell by looking at the degrees. Don’t need a line graph in there."

I had to delete the app and reload it, but it is now seemingly stable. I agree with other reviews that they should back off on all the video content; I just want current and future conditions in a chart. This update gives it, but no better than the previous version. They shouldn’t have bothered, and it frustrates users to re-find the info they need, when it’s moved all around for no apparent reason."
1096,Msjlo,"September 8, 2018",5,Please stop the madness Just when you get used to the changes then a new format is rolled out . It feels like the format has been changed about every other month. I think the users appreciate the information but it could be made much simpler and easier to navigate. Current weather and radar and 5 or 10 day forecast plus the hourly is great. So confusing with all the other minutia😳
1097,buckchops,"September 9, 2018",1,They ruined a great app They took an app that was very simple and easy to use and read (well...except for the annoying increase of video that got in the way more than they helped) and turned it into an unwieldy piece of nonsense that forces you to spend 5 minutes hunting for what you need. The graphs are annoying and take up space. Go BACk to simply showing hi/lo and rain % in EASY to see daily or weekly forecasts WITHOUT scrolling thru 15 screens. The local WFAA app is just as bad...but at least it’s easier to read.  This “update” is a HUGE step backward and will likely result in me deleting the app after swearing by it and recommending it to friends and family for years.
1098,ZRuby,"September 10, 2018",2,"Update is a Downgrade When I open the app, what I want is to see is an easy-to-read graphic showing expected high temp, low temp, and chance of rain for today and for the near future. This app used to do that beautifully. The upgrade is difficult to read. Why the big squiggly line? Yep, the temperature goes up and down every day. I used to use the app to pack for trips-it provided an easy way to see roughly what the weather looked like for the next few weeks. Now it’s an exercise in too much information poorly presented. I’m off to the App Store to look for a new, easier to read app."

I just tried to pull up the Atlanta Ga Airport and I would go to radar and got a blue screen. I went back to the original App and got it. The best view was on Flight Aware.

They started plastering IBM logos everywhere. Then they started inserting annoying intrusive ads where you used to be able to see the weather info.

The hourly feature now no longer shows the wind direction using letters (N or SSW are SO easy to understand!)

About half the time it won’t even open, just a blue screen of nothing.  When it does open up it looks like a page out of the business section of the Times. A graph and a bunch of blah blah.

It rained for an entire day and radar showed nothing, not even a cloud. Location will be set to random places and when I try reporting a wrong location I’m taken to a dead end.

The radar takes forever to load (or simply won’t load at all) on my (new) iPad and the radar shot on the phone has become way too cluttered.  It has become difficult to easily zoom in or out on the radar screen due to the clutter.

Now it requires me to scroll through a bunch of text and still not get the same information I am looking for. Go back to the old layout. There are plenty of improvements you could have made without ruining the functionality. I’ll be looking for a better option."

The hourly temps tell me that more accurately than the curve doodad at the top of the page. Next in importance is when did it last rain, and how much and when will it rain again and how much? No app tells anything about previous rainfall. But I still rely on you for rain forecasts, which are not as easy to get to now."

Bring back the previous version or get a developer that knows what they are doing! This version loads slowly if it even loads!

Upon comparing the Weather Channel app to the radar on the Accuweather app, I discovered that the latter was 100% accurate, the former 100% wrong.

It was easy to read, easy to navigate, and simple.

It’s awkward the way it’s setup and how you have to navigate to the left if you want to click on either hourly or daily reports in detail, which is a key part of checking the weather.

I liked the 5 or 10 day forecast which just displayed — I didn’t have to scroll and scroll and scroll.  The hourly display was more readable.  The map was more quickly accessed.

I have a lot of weather apps, and I try to find the forecast by looking at all of them, but I trust this one by far the most. It also has so many more features than other weather apps. There are some that don’t have a forecast and others that don’t have a radar, but this has both plus UV Index, pollen, what time the sun will rise/set, 15-day forecast, humidity, and more!"
1180,Mmereth,"September 4, 2018",1,"Horrible update This has been my go-to app for years. Until they chose to make it basically unreadable. There was nothing wrong with the old format, which was easy to read and navigate through.  I work in a large geographic area, so I check the weather for multiple towns several times per day. Old app made it simple to just scroll through them. This monstrosity makes you search for a “recent” location every time. "
1181,coyoteswife,"September 7, 2018",1,"New format is a FAIL!!! I’ve had the Weather Channel app for years and it has always been my weather app of choice, even over the one that comes standard on iPhone. However, the latest update is RIDICULOUS. So hard to read and understand, so many pop ups, so busy that it doesn’t scroll fluidly.... just awful. I update operating systems and technology and processes all the time so I understand the learning curve... but this is WOW. I’m not usually a reviewer or a hater, but I hate it so much that I deleted the app then came to the App Store to leave a review since no place to send feedback on TWC website. Ugh! I loved it the original way!! Despise the new format!!!!"
1182,ZTLaidlaw,"September 7, 2018",2,"I’m a fan of redesigns, but… I’m a fan of redesigns, but the latest revision of the Weather Channel app just doesn’t feel right. Yes, it looks more modern, but somehow, it managed to sacrifice user experience in the name of an updated design. Since the overhaul, the information I want no longer feels as accessible; as a result, I’ve found myself checking my other weather apps instead of TWC. "
1183,Dmbisone,"September 11, 2018",5,"Huge improvement I have always liked the weather channel for their information, but between the website and previous apps I was consistently of the belief that they had the worst design and user experience of any tool I consistently interact with.  The recent redesign of this app is outstanding. Very intuitive, with lots of information available without losing simplicity."
1184,oceangirl745,"October 9, 2018",1,"This is the app from h3ll I used to love and use the Weather Channel app several times a day. I paid for the “no ads” version some time ago. When the app was upgraded it became a near constant “wheel of death” or crashed, even after restarting my phone, deleting apps I don’t use often and other measures. Even after deleting and reinstalling the app more than once, it’s hung up on the blue start-up page. I have not been able to get into it for weeks. Is it the Watson part that is hanging it up or causing it to be a memory hog? Is it too many videos? That’s my suspicion. I may just give up and delete permanently, VERY frustrating."
1185,PamLG,"October 9, 2018",4,"New Format Every time there is an update I let out a sigh, here we go again. I have adjusted to this update rather quickly and the recent change to show the five day forecast in an easier view has made it just about perfect. But of course I have one suggestion. On your daily snapshot you should also show the predicted high for the day instead of just the current temperature. It makes it easier for us in s hurry in to know what to expect."
1186,Smeeks24,"October 27, 2018",1,Update is terrible The new version is terrible. Bring back the old version or fix the new junky one. It shouldn't take an hour to check the weather.
1187,Used frequently,"January 1, 2019",2,"Not User Friendly Frequent changes that are too much and has made the app less user friendly. As soon as we get used to one version another is released. Instead of small subtle changes that improves the app, they change the entire appearance. The cool blue background has given away to a white one and the new default is the daily forecast. The white background makes the local radar more difficult to read. Alerts are still nice and reliable. User defined settings to default daily, hourly or today's forecast would be a big improvement."
1188,Kaszhp,"January 16, 2019",1,"NEVER lets me set alerts!!!!???? Will not let me save any of my alert settings! Always says “unable to save alerts at this time try again later”. Also, when I go to settings, they immediately go back to “off” after I’ve selected them and leave the page. Also will not let me edit my “Favorite” locations! I click on the little menu and the phone just jolts like it’s not allowed. Very irritating. I live in a rural area and could really benefit from being able to have my alerts enabled without the settings going back to default the second I leave the page. I’ll raise my stars when/if this issue is resolved."

Every morning I swipe all the way to the left page to see my news and my weather and imagine to my surprise when this morning I couldn’t find my trusty weather widget! This is the first time I’ve ever written a review but I am a creature of habit and I hate having to change my whole morning phone routine because you guys got rid of the widget. Please bring it back.

It takes multiple taps to find the info that I previously only had to scroll to find, and what’s with the sine wave garbage for the day’s high and low temperatures? I now feel like I’m reading a high school math book, not a weather app. "

Let’s strain our eyes some more! 100% TERRIBLE. If you wanted to improve that app the only thing you should have done was make it a dashboard so people can rearrange what they want at the top. No one cares what the temperature curve is for the next week. They just want to know if they should plan for rain, a jacket or shorts. This user since the day I got a smart phone is out until it’s “dumbed down” for those of us that just want to know the weather without 15 mins of fumbling through tabs and getting an eye strain headache.

If I’m looking at the weather it needs to be quick and shouldn’t take me 10 minutes to find what I’m looking for.  Put it back the way it was.   I will be deleting the app as it is too hard to navigate and I don’t have time for that.  If I wanted a difficult app I would have chosen one in the first place.  How about we focus on just the weather.  And not graphs.  I go on to see the numbers, radar ect not an app with all graphs.  Sorry but you went from 5 stars to 1 in my book. I would not recommend this app."

And I plan to delete this app from my phone until you people come to your senses. Which I know you won’t. The paid version is no better. There are better weather apps than this.

1196,Madental,"February 11, 2020",2,PLEASE STOP DRASTICALLY CHANGING IT SO MUCH For the love of God PLEASE stop drastically changing this app so much ! I can barely find what I need .  I can’t even find where layers are now . For example if I want to look at cloud coverage . Everything used to be laid out so easily and was easy to find. Now... forget it .   It’s to the point I barely use this at all anymore because it’s so frustrating. Today was the first time in a long time I tried to use it.  And quickly remembered why I don’t.   I don’t even know why it’s still on my phone. If there are not better improvements it’s getting deleted for good .
1197,Swimlady0,"January 24, 2020",2,Can’t see Radar due to too many ads The point of a radar is to show you and warn you what is coming. If you can’t see the radar thanks the banner add on the bottom and the “Lightning nearby. Upgrade to Premium” banner on the top that even though has an Exit feature it doesn’t work. Plus the speed banner right in the middle of the screen...what’s the point? A tornado could be coming and I wouldn’t be able to see it in the bad storms. Put the ads elsewhere. Keep the radar clear. That’s a whole lawsuit just waiting to happen. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
1198,GamerPlayoyo,"January 23, 2020",3,"Good but STOP PREMIUM It’s good because it gives you up to 14 days of accurate weather!  But it’s bad because the new updates keep reducing the freedom you have to look at stuff.  And now every time you go in the app, it says get premium now!  15 minute accurate forecast and more!  Before the premium you can look at the future 48 hour forecast for snow! Now you can’t!  Worth it if you are the person who just looks at the weather a couple of seconds and then say “I think my flight will not be cancelled.”"
1199,seattlegal,"January 21, 2020",4,"Where did the time go? I like this app, but have a question and could not easily submit it through the app (iOS). It offered you a link to email them but only would accept an attached file. My question is where did the time stamp go on the moving radar map? I can view the next 2 hours (? just guessing) of moving radar and see rain coming, but the time has disappeared so the info is no longer as useful!"

The worse part now are the continuous “The Sky is Falling”.  Most are completely erroneous. They need to look out the window.  And being awakened at 3 AM alerting that a Cyclone in the Indian Ocean is about to drench me in Washington DC, is a bit much. And it goes on and on. I have turned off the alerts. Now I get numerous reminders I am missing great news. I would delete the whole app, except the radar maps have the most reasonable information."

1202,noname johnny,"December 30, 2019",1,"Time to monetize!!! 😔 Great app with great functionality. Used to be completely free which was amazing. However, now they have decided that you need to subscribe to the “Premium” service to get the same features you had before."

I paid for the “premium” upgrade when I got it.. and now it wants me to pay again, for the same things I use to have. (And now it’s $9.99!!) That’s not right! It should have auto rolled over when you do all the “updates” to the app. Why aren’t you allowing people to be grandfathered in.. like they should be? Very very disappointing. People can’t afford to keep paying over and over again because changes might have been made to the app. Not all of them are good changes either!"
1204,Sarahtwinmom,"November 24, 2019",1,"Has gone from bad to worse I have repeatedly contacted support to inform them that each time they “update” their app, it becomes less user friendly and less useful, but they simply like to belittle their users by responding that it will just take a little while to get used to. Now, the feature I used the most, the weather alerts for things like major storms, have been relegated to the notifications section, which do not even open when you click on them to find out the details of the alerts. Looks like after years of swearing by this app, it may be time to get rid of it altogether."

1206,KittinFan,"August 6, 2019",1,"Worst iteration of the weather channel app yet This app is unstable, location data is sometimes wrong, the radar doesn’t animate properly, and the latest addition of the “premium weather channel” advertisement is really annoying. If I want premium, I already know it is there. But please don’t tell me every time I use the app that I could upgrade. Please disable that! The most I’d be willing to pay is $5/year for premium, not $10. $10 doesn’t seem worth it to me. Plus, the app barely works - why would you want to spend money on it? I’d rather buy lunch for myself because that’d be more enjoyable. Would give 0 stars if I could."

Then the app halts for several seconds, is unresponsive, and thereafter it closes and crashes. Then I open it a second time and it works fine.

Now, there are auto play video ads that turn off whatever you’re listening to which is a huge app designer no-no. Ive deleted the app as of this morning. Don’t mess with what I’m already doing on my phone when I open your app. The new design looks pretty but it’s missing key, simple weather info.

The recent changes to both navigation and the removal of a simple 7 day forecast available in a single view without requiring scrolling are significant steps backwards.  The daily view now only shows today and tomorrow’s weather and then you have to scroll.  The view is now horizontal vs. vertical which has attributed to this.  In addition, the rolling line chart view is not useful for a daily view. Bring back a simple 7-10 day view with highs, lows, and rain chance on a single page."
1212,vtv81,"October 13, 2018",2,"User interface took a big step back The new user interface in this version requires much more space to display the weather data. That results in more moving around through the application to see what you really want to see – the weather forecast.  The previous version had higher data density which let you see more forecast data all in one screen. It seems like this is just another case of people changing the user interface because they can, not because it makes a difference in the user experience."

I avoid commercials on TV, so I’m definitely not going to suffer through ads when I’m only checking on today’s weather.

Ive given it several months and several seasons and I honestly don’t like this change. The white background makes it hard to read. When I look at the info I have to click all around and always feel like I’m missing what I’m looking for. I wanted to leave this review in hopes they can change it or fix it. It really just looks old and outdated and not user friendly. I don’t mind it changing from the old model but please make the change for the better. For the time being looking for a new app.

The little bitty graph is harder to read on the phone screen than any other app.  Plus I have no idea how it could say that our outdoor temp was 8 right now but the morning temp would be 31 and work its way down to 8 for overnight. And the rest of the app is too cluttered.  Used to be easy to get the week at a glance.  Now you have to scroll or swipe — it’s not user friendly at all. Since it was “Improved” I’ve never felt like it was reliable or easy to find info.  I’ve started using the Fox weather app, which is much more like the weather channel app used to be."

Now I’m getting messages that IBM is killing off Version 4.5 on May 24th so I’m being forced to Version 9.9. Bummer, Weather Channel! Also, this new version does not perform smoothly.

Now it takes forever to produce any information at all. Just the blue entry screen. Could we go back to having a flash look at the temps, etc, while it loads whatever the heck it is doing, in the background? The only reason I am using it again now is because I am moving and my Google Home is packed. When I ask it about the weather I get an instant answer, which it verbally tells me. The app has lots of Inforntation, which I want to see some of the time, but not every time I click on it."

Try switching between hourly forecast and the radar map."
1241,Bobeechee,"December 3, 2018",2,Why bother with a widget? The widget for this app is worthless. I’d really like to be able to swipe over and quickly view the temperature and the current weather before heading out but the widget is just not reliable.

1242,macmediausa,"December 16, 2018",1,"Can’t trust apple star ratings If you look at just the rating number of 4.2 stars you would think that the ratings are fairly decent.  However if you sort it by most recent, over the past 2 months, the ratings are overwhelmingly 1 star.  How is this so??  The app redesign is absolutely horrible and although I haven’t experienced unstable usage, a majority of reviews reflect this.   I rarely use this app anymore and use others but sometimes I do go back to look at the radar which is still easier than others to decipher."

I go to open it, and it just spins literally until my screen times out, and past that when I touch the screen. Occasionally it will force close, and occasionally it opens. But it’s only about once every few days. Went back to their better (and one-time purchase, add free) app, WeatherMAX. It wasn’t broken, you guys shouldn’t have gotten greedy and tried to fix it for more money around a subscription based ad service. Not using anymore. Only reason I put up with the new one was for the extended radar for traveling, but it’s not worth this garbage."

But, my wife and I have since removed this app several times.  The first time because we disliked the new format then another time out of disgust for the distracting moving ads.  It is far too busy.  We have given up reinstalling it at a later time in the hopes that newer versions might have changed it back to a better state.  Apparently, it is all about the money not forecasting the weather.  Go for another app!"

And probably the most annoying bug anytime i get a notification from this app it stays on my screen until i flick it away. I’ve tried everything in the settings and it still does this everyday.

Over the last few months I’ve noticed that the local temperatures were several degrees warmer than the actual temperatures. I figured out that the app was listing it’s predicted temperature as the actual. I emailed several times and never received a response other than a canned response telling me to look up their privacy policy. Obviously the problem has never been rectified despite at least two updates. I guess they figure Watson is smarter than God.

I get that my daily says I have 90% chance of rain tomorrow, but when tomorrow. I used to be able to plan because I could see when the rain was most likely to hit. Now I can see 24 hours, but 7 of them are in the past, so I can see only 17 future hours. Why do I need a past forecast (pastcast?)? If you really do pay attention to our comments, please bring back the 48 hour hourly forecast, even if it is in the current format. Thanks."

I have used the weather channel app for years, in fact, ever since it came out but that streak ended the day they came out with their latest version. It is not user friendly at all, too much white which makes it hard to read and is not organized in a cohesive way to deliver the weather in an simple and easy to understand manner. I don’t know who they listened to that sold them on this new version and lay out but they should be fired because I know I’m far from the only one who feels this way.

There are a couple of things I’d change — it is very easy to swipe unintentionally into the vertically scrolling daily or hourly display but you can’t swipe out of it; you have to tap the little back arrow — but overall the app is much improved and allows fast access to information in an intuitive fashion."
1260,sushigal5,"January 23, 2018",5,Accurate forecasts We were on vacation and needed to plan a shopping day. My Weather Channel app said Tuesday will rain 100%. Perfect for shopping since you can’t do anything fun in the rain. Everyone else’s apps said 40 or 50% chance. But Weather Channel was right and it rained the entire Tuesday. Sometimes the radar map gets jumpy but it’s got a lot of info and a pretty dependable extended forecast. Great app.

The weather channel app has been updating the free app to take features away. Like showing only 2 days of hourly weather with the upgrade to premium message if you want to see more. I am never going to pay for a weather app, never. The weather isn’t accurate anyway but yet you want us to pay for your computer generated scenarios. I’m going to find something else to replace it.

They have tweaked a few things since then but lost the idea that more is less for many users. Also, Radar views now load very slow or now at all. Sometimes It is quicker to kill the app and reload than wait for radar to load a different view while in the app. Started using accuweather for when I want to see radar views. Oh, connection speed is not the issue. It is lousy coding."

Something has changed for the worst I’m sad to say as the seamless feel and appearance is gone and the forecasting is appallingly wrong quite often now. As an example today it has rained all day long and the hourly report showed cloudy every hour and 0 percent chance of rain every hour except 1. I am on the road all day and need reports to assess whether or not to schedule my appointments for inside work or outside. I find that what used to be a reliable forecast is now all but useless. I understand that forecasting is an imperfect science but i do expect at least a modicum of accuracy. So sad.

For example, one day I checked the weather in the morning and it said it would be partly cloudy with a 0% chance of precipitation. This was not the case. It snowed for five hours that day and when I went to check the app to see when it would stop, it didn’t even show that it was snowing and it wasn’t on the radar at all.

1301,J0567,"June 25, 2018",1,"Very disappointing I could show examples but the bottom line is I cannot depend on this app to accurately predict my weather on a daily basis let alone rely on weekly forecasts. It has been getting worse over the last few months. I’ve been waiting and hoping it would improve but have run out of patients. I see a 4 out of 5 rating so it’s working for someone, just not me. So I’m leaving this comment and removing the app from all the devices I have. Good luck with your app. I hope you can work out the bugs and be as dependable an app as you used to be. At least for those of us that it no longer works for."

And the 15 day forecast is too far down.   Also, awhile ago there used to be 15 minute forecasts which was very helpful and accurate.  It was great for getting the dog walked before rain or between showers.   Still a very good reliable site."

I realize that's how you get payed for maintaining, etc if the app, but PLZZ limit them to one or two at most. I find your radar graphics are great, but not sure why the forecasts can be quite off. Quite often it says storms starting at.....(9:00 for example) yet is 9:30 and sky is clear. 🤔"

Then, once again works till ad free is enabled, the ads go away along with the app.  So close but yet so far."

Now the designers have joined the legions of other app designers who appear intent on making their apps more difficult to read for many. You don’t redesign an app just to make it look pretty. Readers shouldn’t have to struggle to merely read font. Let’s go back to dark font on light background or the reverse. Low contrast, however, just makes life more difficult for the user. Or, at least, provide the user a choice in settings. Thank you."
1306,mine717,"September 5, 2018",5,Visual The visual on the new version is terrible. All white background makes it very hard on the eyes. Small black lettering on white difficult to read and on eyes.

Will find somewhere else to get my weather. Too bad🙁

Now I’m getting pop up ads.. ads on the radar plus a pop up ad wanting me to upgrade.. how many times do I have to click out of that? And then all the ads on the videos that are simply garbage full of rhetoric. Everything is laid out badly and all the ads make it feel unorganized.

Now they’ve changed to a subscription model where you have to pay every year to remove ads. So they have put ads back into my app! This is pure bait and switch. At the time I paid, the legal contract I entered into was paying for ads to be removed permanently. Just because TWC changes their deal, doesn’t mean they should be able to go back and retroactively yank the deal from everyone who paid for the ONE-TIME unlock fee. It’s outrageous and I’m reporting it to Apple."

Who pays $9.99 a month for information you can readily find elsewhere??  It’s gotten to the point where every time you open the app or try to access what used to be a free feature, they are asking you to upgrade.  Sorry Weather Channel, not gonna do it!  Just dumb.

1320,Fromthemountains,"September 17, 2018",1,New update has me longing for older version I’m not a fan of the new version (version 10) for the iPhone. I liked the simplicity of being able to see a 5day forecast without having to scroll to view additional days. And who cares of seeing a plot wave of the temperatures. I just want to know the temp high/low and percent chance of rain. They’re trying to do too much when they were good at having reliable info with a simple interface. I’ve started using the Apple weather app that comes standard on the iPhone. Wasn’t sure how to leave feedback so wrote a review. Will gladly revise the review if things change.

1323,Luvs27,"October 1, 2018",2,Not a good update I was excited about the update but now that I’ve had it for a few weeks I have noticed it’s not so great. The daily forecast is hard to read/ understand due to it being so cluttered. It would be nice to have a weekly/daily forecast in one graphic instead of having to scroll forever. I do like the new radar map. It’s easy to use. I am disappointed because the main reason i use my weather ap is to check the weekly forecast and it’s too difficult on this app. I will be deleting it and going back to my old one.

The writing is small and light. The colors of the weather icons (clouds, sun, etc) are dull. It’s really hard to read. Why did you have to change something that worked and was great into something awful? I have seen Facebook posts of friends asking other friends what weather apps they use because they don’t like this app anymore. I’m about to join them in finding another app. In my opinion, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it."

1327,auntiex5,"April 18, 2019",1,User Unfriendly Since the update I no longer like the app. It’s so much more time spent just getting to the forecast. It was much better before the update. I’m deleting the app. It’s also too bright and white. Please darken the background to how it was previously. The dark blue background makes it pop. It really is a downgrade from what it was! After numerous updates I see you still haven’t darkened the background. The white is horrible! PLEASE return it to when it was user friendly. I’ll be patient and wait one more update for improvements. If not then I’m out. Also I paid for ad free and there are ads everywhere.

It rained 3 days last week that you showed 0% chance of rain until it actually started raining then you updated. It didn’t rain at all over the weekend which you had pegged at 50% chance of rain both days. SIGH, It must be all the polar ice caps melting that’s made forecasting so difficult."

Enough with trying to be progressive with your ads and videos and just do what people actually ask for: A weather app that actually works. I wouldnt recommend this app to my worst enemy.

I know this isn’t the apps fault but it’s still inaccurate. It’s only accurate maybe 4 hours ahead. Like right now. 11:44am on Sunday. It’s suppose to be mad storming. Well. It’s not.

Since I primarily use my iPad in a landscape mode, many of the screens are set up to work best in a portrait mode. I am forced to scroll from the middle of the screen which is troublesome at best.

And what is all of the other junk, because it’s not my forecast!"

Although some of the changes are good, the icons for the hourly reports are so faint that it’s difficult to see the difference between cloudy or or rain. The white background needs to be changed or the icons need to be bolder enough for those of us who don’t have perfect reading vision.

Having to navigate to see the daily forecast and the weekly forecast is also not clear. I don’t know why they’d update to a worse layout. Don’t “fix” what isn’t broken. Just like Snapchat, another app down the drain all because they thought they had to update and make it newer. Terrible!"

I don’t like scrolling side to side to see my weekly forecast; up-down scrolling is way more intuitive but now I have to click several times to find the up-down daily forecast. We are bombarded with so much information at once in our lives already; simple is the way to go with an app like this. Please change this back to a more user-friendly inferface!"

The problem with the new Weather Channel app isn’t that they’ve done a wholesale change of the app, but that the new direction is confusing to the eye and very unfriendly to the user. Visually, it is quite a step backwards. The design is confusing with few visual indicators to help your eye quickly find what you want to see. I generally have found Weather Channel to have a reasonably functional app in the past, but the headache-inducing redesign has me looking for a better designed app to use."

Then, I got the new iPhone XS Max a couple weeks ago, and I’m having the same issues. I have emailed the Weather Channel support team twice and received no response.

The radar map is useless due to it’s inaccuracy. It was raining in my area and the map showed no indication of precipitation. The fact that you have to pay a subscription for poor development is ridiculous. The free app is full of ads which hinders its main purpose, to show the weather.

I have tried the restore purchase numerous times but the app come back with “nothing to restore”.  Use the free service if you don’t mind ads but do not paid for the premium. Look at the reviews. No customer service so use at your own risk. Apple will not refund. I have had several iPhones—my first was the iPhone 3—so I’m well versed in all things related to in-app purchases. Wasted money.

It seems as though this coincided with an upgrade of the new app. I’m certainly not going to upgrade to the premium app. I’ll give it some time to see if this can work out but I think I’m going to have to start looking for a new app. It looks like someone tried to fix something that wasn’t broken.

Also now the home screen has a big add right in the middle so you must scroll down to see the basic features such as today/hourly/10 day.

Then it also gives what the weather by the hour on a slide bar but the highs and lows do not match what they say it will be and often is off by several degrees. Also when I is windy it shows a symbol for wind but doesn’t show if it will be cloudy or clear. As far as I know it can be sunny and windy at the same time.

I liked the old app where you could see day to day way easier. And you used words. And sentences. Ahh yes. Is this making it easier or just dumbing it down for everyone? Too bad.

I can turn all notifications on in my phone settings and the app and it won’t let me get rain notifications. If I click the prompt it says “unable to change your alerts at this time. Please try again later.” I’ve been trying for months and I even contacted support - it’s been 2 weeks with no response. Thanks for caring Weather Channel ....
1426,Marlet78,"September 4, 2019",3,"Radar inaccurate Hi there.. not sure why but the radar isn’t accurate. On the home screen for the radar it will show a major storm coming but when you try to play the animation the storm disappears. I used to think it was because the storm actually broke up but now I realize it’s an issue with the animation. One instance was that I could see a major storm coming, animation showed it wasn’t there anymore but moments later we got a major storm from which I lost power."
1427,Souldeep2000,"September 3, 2019",1,"Very Disappointed I have used the Weather Channel app for years, but with the changes made and the current hurricane in progress, I’m very disappointed. Why is the tab for the hurricane full of videos and why can’t there be a simple map of the current location, forecast for the path and current status(wind, category, pressure and movement), also maps of the evacuation zones. If I’m in the storm and have limited resources I’m not going to be able to watch videos. Also the auto play is a use of my data and battery. Once again limited resources makes this a problem."

Amazing how far we have come. Thanks to all involved.

Hourly and daily are available with one click at the bottom of the screen and none of the rest of the info is of any use to me. The videos, news, health and that stuff is useless and just slows things down. I only keep this app because i like the way the radar looks. Sometimes the radar is slow but when it works it’s the best radar. I use a different app for hourly and longer term forecasts."

1433,DMwildone,"September 5, 2018",3,"Just OK I have found the app less useful with the latest upgrades. Wish they still gave a forecast of relative humidity a few days out....that makes a big difference in areas where it changes often.....seeing the current humidity is not very helpful (I can see that for myself without an app). The new look & feel is just OK.....I do like that all the videos are not up front and in the way, but otherwise not much has really been added that I can see or use."
1434,RMudd,"September 5, 2018",3,"Liked the pervious version better Since the update to the whimsical color scheme the information is so much more difficult to read. The squiggly lines do not help my understanding of the weather coming up and the weekly forecast is hard to find. If keeping you on the app longer was their angle, I guess they succeeded since it takes me so much longer to find the simple information I need. I liked this app much better before the upgrade. Simple and to the point."

Now it has 102k in a matter of WEEKS people, majority of it of course being 1 star and still this company doesn’t respect what we want.

Well consistently the report is said 1-3 inches no matter what we get. It could be a dusting or 12 inches, the report says 1-3 inches every time! Says to me that who ever inputs the data is just lazy, sees snow on the report from where they get their data and just puts in 1-3. There’s no reason to continue using the app unless the data gets reported properly. However the temp is usually the only thing that is accurate overall."

I can usually deal with ads if I’m getting a good app for free..but I have been annoyed to my limit with the same exact advertisement being played before/after playing any video or content. Im going to have to pay for the paid ad-free version of this app now (good strategy maybe?) to get away from having to hear the same Campbell’s soup ad in between every video. Need more variety in the ads.
1442,MikeM2,"April 21, 2018",1,"Forecasts are wildly inaccurate It’s not that the app is so bad, it’s just that the Weather Channel is more geared towards selling adds than forecasting weather.  Typical was this morning, where the app indicated 5%-15% chance of rain, and the radar showed the only rain showers were 50 miles away over the past two hours.  I put on all of my riding gear, rolled my motorcycle outside, and found that it a rain shower was blowing through.  A check of another weather source showed 52% chance of rain, and their radar showed rain showers all around over the past hour.  This kind of thing happens all of the time."

Temperature is usually off from my 2 thermometers at the house but I can live with it. My area has experienced a steady barrage of spotted rain showers this summer (Fl. Panhandle) and the coverage is 90% spot-on. I’m satisfied. Better than my wife’s choice of weather apps. I know because we have a game of comparisons and this Weather App is #1.
1445,chill75,"April 9, 2020",1,"Pop up ads ruined it I liked previous versions of this app, a lot. I didn’t mind the occasional small banner ad because they weren’t intrusive, and it’s a small price to pay for good information. Then it asked me to upgrade to premium every time I opened it. Annoying, but not a complete dealbreaker. Now, every time I navigate to a different part of the app, there’s a pop up ad with a microscopic close button. So now there are upgrade solicitations, huge banner ads, and pop ups. Is IBM doing so poorly that they’re desperate for the revenue?"
1446,Not Duper,"February 7, 2020",1,"What have you donetothis app? This was the best and most reliable app on my ipad. I much preferred it to the pre-installed weather app and frequently recommended it to friends. Now it is a bunch of garbage. I frequently used it on road trips to see the weather we’re coming up on, so I had a list of locations I could swipe back and forth and refer to it frequently. Seems like there is only one location available at a time now. Also, it is very difficult to see and read. Looks less like an app and just a link to a webpage. You’ve truly outdone yourselves if your goal was to lose customers."

Then, all of a sudden the ads came back, it went back to just showing the hourly weather for a day and a half, and I’m still being charged for Premium. I deleted the app and reinstalled it.

It feels like you have too many people working on the weather channel app. The team obviously has too much time on their hands since they thought it would be a good experiment to change everything that everyone loves about their app. Maybe I’m wrong and your problem is that you have some new arrogant project manager who is trying to make a name for himself/herself by being responsible for a successful and radical redesign. Either way, we like the old layout. Be happy with that. Just stop irritating your customers by changing something that we already like."

Now Everything is “all over the place”. Those are only TWO of my complaints about the new API. I am switching to another weather app RIGHT NOW! I am only one user but I hope that other like-minded users will write in on this!

I have a difficult time getting any useful info from this new version. I gave 2 stars only because the radar is still good.

Recently the old app totally stopped working at all so now I’m forced into the new app.  If you read the reviews I’m not the only one missing the old app, so is the developer even interested in what we like?

Unfortunately the new design is less readable, harder to navigate and just poorly designed.   Classic case of taking a really good thing and making it worse.  I was able to keep using the old App until last week.   I guess they finally stopped supporting it or the iOS upgrade tanked it.   I’m searching for a replacement."

You might want to tell them “you’re fired!”   WTForcast is now my #1 app then WU then Accuweather then look outside then ask my 4 year old then maybe, just maybe if all that has failed I might re-download yours and check the weather.

All the things that used to be easy and make the app worthwhile have either been taken away or are so hard to read that it is next to impossible to use. I should say it’s almost impossible to use if you can even get it to load. The reviews are more overwhelming negative then for any app update I have ever seen.

I also feel like there is too much focus on videos. Now and then I enjoy them, but I feel like they are now the bulk of the app. I understand you are the weather channel, so I suppose that makes sense.

The videos are entertaining, but not absolutely necessary and tend to slow down the loading of the information. A minor nuisance, nothing to get upset about. Keep up the good works."
1554,EliteEthos,"August 27, 2018",3,"New update is... 😬🤷🏻‍♂️ Just did the update. There is potential there but if you guys are taking over WU you should start making your app a serious weather app. Nobody cares what it “feels like”. It seems you deleted the barometric pressure readings to make room for the “feels like” temp. It’s ridiculous in my opinion.  Also, how much can it really cost a giant like The Weather Channel to run an app?  $3.99 should be the price for going ad-free for life!  Some sort of permanent ad-free option should be offered."
1555,Daddy Katz,"August 28, 2018",5,"Still my most trusted weather app I really enjoy using this app to check my weather. I also find the brief weather news segments very informative.

1556,Spursfan4sure,"August 29, 2018",4,Monotonous I like the weather app and the favorites page which allows me to keep up on whether in areas where friends and family live. The one thing I don’t like is the repetitive ads and the length of time you are required to watch them! I don’t mind an ad I can skip after seven or eight seconds but having to watch the same 20-30 second ad over and over again drive me crazy.
1557,Grandmaw3,"August 29, 2018",5,Glad I have this app! I check this app every day. I am out driving every day. Because I live in a large community the roads get backed up depending on the weather. With this app I determine  which route to take .  I make up my mind if I am going to take back roads or the expressway. I love planning ahead. I hate sitting on a highway having no idea when the traffic might move again.

I work in landscaping and primarily use the forecast and radar feature. It all takes so long to load anymore it’s pointless to even have on my phone and when it does finally load, it’s laggy when you try to scroll or there’s a delay when you try and tap on something to make full screen.

The new version crams a bunch of information on a single screen that forces the user to scroll down to get to data that is arranged in a non-user friendly way. It is no longer easy to use. Additionally it is always slow to load since it always has to pull radar information up immediately.

The radar struggles to zoom in or out and ads pop up constantly kicking you back to the main screen. It isn’t expensive to upgrade to premium for some more advanced features but why would anyone when the free version barely works. For all I’d know I’d be paying for the advanced features that barely work too. I tried contacting the app support but the link takes you to a blank redirected webpage. I’ve already deleted and switched to a different app."

I enjoyed using it until the app updated and now I have banner ads and commercials before videos. Your info is not that valuable. Your info is not valuable enough for a monthly subscription. NOOA is not as slick, but it’s accurate and perfect. I bought it and no ads or commercials. You should have grandfathered all of us who initially bought the app instead of updating the app and we lost what we purchased. No ads and no commercials. Not played well, The Weather Channel app."

I’ve loved all of the detailed weather information (I’m a weather guru), especially when bad weather is heading our way. However, all of the sudden there are ads everywhere on my app. This is so very annoying. I refuse to pay to upgrade to the premium, which would remove the ads. Everyone wants fees these days and I’m tired of it. If it doesn’t change, I will sadly be permanently removing this app and finding a new weather app. This was a 5 star app before all of the ads took over. I give it zero now."

Now we get constantly bombarded not only with ugly full page ads, but pop ups for premium to disable the ads. It’s too much. Any thought I have of subscribing is now gone just on general principal. I get that it costs money to run hut the massive ad load should be able to pay for it (a 30 second ad to watch a 20 second video, really?) stop acting like a scam free to play game."
1576,Men Igna,"November 2, 2019",1,"Don’t Know Where They Get Their Information I have had this app for about a year.  It is amazing how consistently inaccurate the “current temperature” in my city is reported.

How will I ever know if the temperature reported in a city across the country is correct?  "
1577,ChristieMarie4,"October 17, 2019",1,"Update destroyed battery Loved the app itself, but since the recent update, my battery was dropping from full to zero in an hour. After searching through settings, I found that this app was single-handedly using my entire battery, and somehow running in the background 100% of the time, while all other apps run in the background for a matter of a few minutes. Not sure what mad science is being conducted in the background, but this should probably be looked into. Turned off every setting for this app until this gets fixed."
1578,IseeFloridiots,"September 13, 2019",2,"Monetary over humanity It’s owned by IBM and promotes ads at every single turn, including when you’re in the path of a hurricane and just trying to see the forecast. They are strictly monetizing destruction and promoting fear. It’s obvious whenever you watch one of their clown “meteorologist” stooges talk about weather with a constant mention of impending doom. Used to be a good app, now it’s just Fox News or any other station looking for ratings. There are better weather apps out there which won’t try to monetize you while you try to keep your family safe."
1579,Speechless in DE,"September 4, 2019",1,No longer works For the 6 months I no longer get any type of accurate weather. I wish I could put a pic in this review. I’m in DE and it’s cloudy and foggy right now at about 71 degrees yet the app is telling me it’s sunny at 77 degrees. Guys it’s not sunny- there’s a hurricane down the way(Dorian). Also I get inaccurate notifications- “it’ll be much warmer in claymont tomorrow” -Um.... its cooler not warmer so??? Or I get it’ll start raining in 20 mins but it’s currently in the middle of a torrential downpour? I think your satellites are messed up and someone somewhere needs to figure out how to recalibrate your satellites and app. Other reviews are saying the same.
1580,Firekracker923,"October 9, 2018",2,Unhappy with new UI I’d give the app more stars if you didn’t change the entire UI. I loved how I could see the week at a glance by just scrolling to the right a little.

Have used it for years but now this app doesn’t even show the Barometric Pressure!! I have Migraines & they are affected by this but someone decided to pretend they were providing something better & see if they could squeeze a lot of money from viewers to view the weather. Very sad. ‘The Accent of greed in America” was a book, then a documentary & unfortunately very true. Try AccuWeather!! It seems to be doing a fairly decent job for me. At least, it’s better than the pitiful Weather Channel."
1582,Tobias Alexander,"December 22, 2018",1,"Goodbye TWC The new UI is terrible.  The updates from the Weather Channel all say “we’re reading your reviews and feedback and are making improvements.”  Boloney!  Most of the reviews are asking to go back to the old interface.  It is obvious that TWC has no intention of doing that, even though it is the one improvement that most are asking for.  I used to love TWC app, but sadly I am going to delete it and won’t put it back on my phone until they go back to the old UI,  which is probably never.  I’ve been a loyal TWC user for many, many years.  No more.  They aren’t listening."

1584,Staley Seefeldt,"January 17, 2019",1,"Used to be great! This used to be my go-to app, unfortunately it has been extremely inaccurate since the big update. I live in Minnesota and it is very aggravating when the local news tells me there will be 6-8 inches of snow and freezing rain in the area and this app tells me there is only a 10% chance on there being any snow. It has been snowing for hours and the app tells me it isn’t snowing at all. I also have alert notifications on and it doesn’t alert me at all. I ignored the apps inaccuracy for a couple months now but I was too irritated by it to keep it any longer."
1585,Go Pandora!,"January 18, 2019",1,How can you screw something up so badly What a disaster the “upgrade” is!  Hourly forecast with the sine wave is stupid and doesn’t match the % for rain from when you swipe to see it more in the old (easier to follow) old format.

I don’t care for these notifications, so stop spamming me with them.  Also, fix the Breaking News spam.  When it keeps toggling itself on and giving me notifications other than what I’ve asked for (Real-time Rain, Severe Weather Alerts, etc.), it’s a surefire way to get me to uninstall and never use again.

You have to dig thru to actually find your weather forecast. Where’s the daily, weekly, 10 day forecasts? They tried to do too much with this app, and it’s too complicated to weed thru. Shouldn’t be that navigate thru, it’s an app most people use on their phones on the go. Not user friendly or efficient at all."

Consider those who have yo wear reading glasses which I presume is your audience. The white background causes a terrible glare resulting in not being able to see the numbers clearly at all.  Therefore I will have to find another app unless you change the background color. The new update is not as easy to navigate either. "

The constant scrolling is not so bad, not so great BuT what I really miss is the UV index that used to be closer to the top of the screen.

What is even sadder is you’re not even answering those that have complained! Have you figured out from the dozens of negative reviews that we don’t want wavy graphs, the feeling that we’re scrolling through pages of a book nor do we want to take extra steps to locate a weekly forecast.

Weird line graphs showing temperature and multiple numbers make it difficult to find the temperature for a specific day. Forget about trying to find the extended 15 day forecast unless you enjoy scrolling and scrolling. It's like the Weather Channel took a page out of Snapchat's book during their redesign.

Just highs and lows with rain chance for 10 days is all that is needed.

I’m sure I use this app at least four to six times a day.  I love the weather channel app."
1617,Easywinlotto,"September 17, 2019",3,"Opening problem I have had the Weather Channel app for a few years now. But for the last few months, it is difficult to open. It automatically closes on the first time you open it. You have to click on the app at least 2 times and sometimes 3 times. I am downloading a new weather app and will probably get rid of the Weather Channel. It’s very annoying to have an app close on you as soon as you open it!"
1618,Dori's mom,"September 5, 2019",1,"TWC Upgrade Very frustrated with TWC. I purchased the app several weeks ago. I’m still seeing ads with the videos, and do not get the 96 hour hourly forecast. With each inquiry I receive a standard email response assuring me they’re working on it but nothing beyond that. There is no dispute that it’s been paid for, but simply no further communication or resolution to the lack of services I’ve paid for. I’ve had the upgrade in the past and had no problems. I realize that $9.99 isn’t a lot but it seems wrong to advertise and sell a service and then fail to deliver that service."
1619,Red racer,"August 16, 2019",4,Missing the last frame. When clicking on the “past” button to view radar it appears the last radar capture is missing. I’ve noted this on several occasions. If you look at radar the frame you are viewing is not included when you click on the “ past” button to view the sequence up to now. Otherwise I like the app.
1620,Mherring,"April 7, 2019",5,Everything you need to know. The weather Channel has everything you need to know with the touch of a button. You can see the weather currently our view what’s coming.

Not the detailed one you have to scroll through- the one where you can simply see the sun/clouds icon & high/low temps for 5 days at once. Can’t find it & the the new layout is too busy. I know the point of more screens is to show more adds, but if we can’t find what we’re looking for, we’ll look elsewhere. This used to be one of my favorite apps, I’m really mad at myself!"

Daily shows up in the quick scan format which I like and everyone else likes.  If I want to know more about a particular day I click on it.  Simple.  This is both confusing, unnecessary and last but not least annoying.    The information is great but the ease of use gone!  The name of the game here is to make something better not worse"
1626,Rnftlbrnft,"July 23, 2019",1,"Wrong forecasts I am wondering more and more from where this app gets its information because it is so often wrong. Today I got into a drenching downpour after the app forecasted sun and clouds. In the midst of the downpour it described the current weather as clear with showers in the vicinity. Back home it said Rain shower while the sun was shining. I wouldn’t mind if this happened occasionally, but actually the app is occasionally right and mostly wrong. Looking out the window gives you a better idea than looking at this app. How about less entertainment (videos etc.) and more accuracy!"
1627,MegaWhy,"July 4, 2019",5,Weather Channel app is the best I have tried many weather apps and the weather channel ends up being the very best of all of them.

Also, the UV index is not anywhere to be found. I am very unhappy with the new app and wish I could downgrade back to the version I have used for years. It’s also not as clear to read the 14 day forecast  from the home site. I always appreciated the snapshot view and never really look at he detailed daily 14 day forecast. I’m very much frustrated with my update and am researching new weather applications. It’s a shame because I actually use the ads that pop up on my page"

I enjoyed the iconic forecast for 15 days.  Although it was rarely accurate it was better than most other apps.  I am so disappointed that I will be deleting it and searching for a replacement.  To bad as I really enjoyed this one.  So sad!  I wrote directly to the Weather Channel app people and received a generic response.  Therefore I can only conclude that they don’t even read their emails.  Finally I have switched to another app, and deleted this one.  So sad."
1635,sfcsc,"November 16, 2018",1,"Hate the redesign I’m not one of those people who hate change and resist upgrades...but I must say I hate the user experience of this redesign. The app was effortless to use before, and I’ve happily used it for years giving it a 5 star rating, but now I find myself using other weather apps because the changes have made it a pain to use. Everyone I know who has used the app for years is saying the same thing. The new look/charts are difficult to use at a glance and not quick and easy like before...I hope revisions are coming soon or time to move on from this app."
1636,judesamson79,"December 15, 2018",1,"Used to be good There was a time this was a good app. I tolerated the updates but this last one is horrible. “Beautifully redesigned”???!?!?? You mean cumbersome, repetitive, and useless. I wish it were easy to rollback because I’d go back and just use the app that way but this new update is so terrible I’m just uninstalling it entirely and going elsewhere. If this is what they consider a great update and it just keeps getting worse every time they mess with it there’s no reason to keep it anymore. Spare yourself the headache and just use something else - they all use the same core weather readings from NOAA anyway."

I go and restore my purchase, bam!, radar doesn't work again. I've emailed support several times and no response. Now, do I keep the ads and have a working radar? Or no ads and a non working radar...

Really stupid and disappointing."
1641,ShockerM,"August 27, 2018",4,Great redesign! Some functionality not totally there yet... I love the redesign. The app no longer looks like a bad Windows 7 app. Access to weather data is a lot easier than the prior version. Feels and navigates like a proper iOS app now. 
1642,Eighth Lake Ike,"August 28, 2018",5,"Great App The Weather Channel app is all you need!  It’s easy and accurate.  You can see the weather by the hour, day, or 15 days. It shows the radar, and gives alerts for bad weather in your area.  It also shows the weather forecast for your favorite places by simply searching the place you’re looking for.  It’s all in one app. It’s great!"
1643,rustyspades86,"September 1, 2018",1,"F- I never review apps but this update was so atrocious I could not help writing this. The App was effective for simple weather updates and the ability to get further information when needed. The new update fails in every aspect. From presentation of information to user navigation, the changes made in the latest update are so poor in quality I couldn’t have ever imagined that a team of people would say “yeah this is the changes we need to make”. Just wow... with the presentation of this update I will be finding a new weather app provider and ensuring the voice of this customer will be spread."
1644,Kabaj,"September 1, 2018",5,Decent But not as good as it used to be. Radar is sluggish. Videos are cool all with the same required to view ad makes it annoying. But it’s still my favorite weather app.
1645,vmoesmith,"September 2, 2018",2,"Newest update disappointing The newest update is very disappointing. There isn’t enough contrast in the colors to read the information easily. There is no weekly view visible on one screen - one has to first click on the Daily tab, then scroll across the screen to see the info, and interpreting it is not intuitive. The seven white blocks of info are simply in the way. There is no quick way to return to the top, besides scrolling or double tapping TWC icon.  The dark blue contrasting background and readily visible info was much better."

I couldn’t find the 15 day at a glance and the new hour by hour doesn’t have precipitation percentages or wind speeds!  They moved the hour by hour into a graph.  That would be ok if you could swipe to the traditional view.  Without a detailed hour by hour, it is difficult to plan for many outdoor sports and activities! I deleted the app from my phone!  I’ll check back every so often to see when they make the improvements or bring back the old version!  I wish I never had updated from version 9.2!"
1647,rangerone13,"September 3, 2018",2,"Same as last time For the past year, the app has worked fine. After a long period of slow-to-load or not loading, it was working pretty reliably. Now with the new release, I’m back to slow-to-load and lock-ups and no load at all, whether I’m using cell service or home wi-fi. And like I did last time, I’ll uninstall the Weather Channel app and use one provided by a local news channel. After 6 or 8 months, I’ll try the Weather Channel app again to see if it’s finally loading so I can use it."

Now I can’t find that view at all and have to vertical scroll through the details of each day. And I can’t get past the 3rd day. The app just freezes up.

I can’t say that I’m surprised however. Everything IBM touches tends to go south once it’s under their influence. I hope they’re happy with the way they’ve destroyed this wonderful, once very useful app. I’m sure they followed the same model they have with a lot of stuff I’ve seen them put their hands on over the years; acquire it, offshore development, milk whatever remaining profits exist, watch as the rotting carcass dries up and blows away, move on. Sad."

FORCED to 'change' (this is no update) from Storm app. Storm app was pretty darn good... near perfect. It was designed for an iPad --- Multiple locations at a tap. Forecast at a swipe. Regional temp station info is... was all there. Historical info etc. this thing-- who the heck can't tell if is running weather?.. Stupid. What's the temp 10 miles away... never know. It's summer... why is there a skiing forecast? ugh.  Guess it wasn't making enough money for Weather Channel or sent to amateur designers or both. Time to search for a new app!

Now I have to deal with crashes while using the app, stalls when opening (I have to close then reopen) and I have to endure the insistent push from IBM to buy the premium app so I can get 3 days of hourly data (which, if I remember correctly, I had before IBM bought TWC...) As far as I can tell IBM took away useful features so they could charge me for them.)"

I didn’t have an issue until I installed the app on my iPad. Now, all of the notifications and such go to my iPad, and not my phone, which is a pain because I have my phone with me way more than my iPad. Perhaps the issue is related to using the same Apple ID account for both devices? I tried reinstalling the app on my phone and still do not get them notifications, even though they are sent to my iPad."

It was much easier and info was much more upfront and accessible.  Also, it’s totally ridiculous how you now have to change locations.  Used to do it with one swipe, now it takes 2 touches and woe on you if you forgot to favorite a location, then you have to type out and do a search for it (don’t forget to select the tiny favorite star or you get to do it all over again).  Deleting it, no second chances."
1657,hankery g.5,"December 26, 2019",1,"Inaccurate and scam Do not plan your day using the information from this app. The hourly forecast is constantly changing, and often does not indicate impending severe weather events. Daily weather forecasts change every few minutes, as does the chance of precipitation. I trust the national weather service much more. The adds are getting worse and more frequent as well. Also, Now they make you update and buy premium In order to see the hourly forecast past 24 hours, as well as the snowfall forecast map. I used to love them. Such a shame they went so low."

Had we listened to your weather predictions for last weekend, we would have ruined a celebration for a lost friend.

If I want to see the crappy morning, afternoon, evening, and night line graph that shows the weather, I have to click the hourly tab, wait a few seconds, click the weather channel tab, pull down to reload, and maybe in 5 more seconds I’ll have that useless graph. Quick glance at highs and lows? Screw that. Easy access to weather alerts? Nope. Quick glance at total snowfall for the day? Who needs that? This app has progressively gotten worse with each update in my opinion."

You need to quit forecasting so far in the future because it’s getting ridiculous.  I only downloaded your app to take the place of weather scan on Comcast you just don’t fit the bill. You are really terrible

It takes a long time to load (sometimes never)and when it does it’s extremely hard to navigate through the app because of how laggy and slow it is... a simple task of checking the weather takes me 5+ minutes with this thing... it’s often so laggy that when you’re scrolling it just stops basically because the app can’t handle scrolling... I have a good phone and this is the only app I have problems with mind you. I’m finally getting rid of the weather channel app.

I’ve purchased ad free without a grumble because the app used to be the most informative weather app available. But I haven’t had functioning radar in a month, which essential to my job, so it’s now next to useless to me. Add to that that the info I’m looking for in a forecast is usually in video form, which isn’t always practical when you travel a lot. And then there’s the vide barrage any time I try to find info.

You can’t see the weekly forecast without clicking onto a few different screens. I need something to check the weather quickly and easily which this used to be. It was simple. It’s now no longer user friendly at all and makes it unbearable to use. I used to use this app all the time bc of how easy and uncomplicated it was. I will no longer be using this app and will find another one instead. Really disappointed.
1671,Yellowbellyranchu,"September 5, 2018",4,"Actually like it now After the last update, I downgraded the review to 2 stars. I didn’t like the new look and didn’t find it intuitive.

1674,Happycruisemom,"September 11, 2018",1,Version 10.0 is horrible Prior to the latest update (10.0) I used the weather channel app often as I travel for work frequently.  The features were easy to use and the daily weather was easy to follow.  Version 10.0 is horrible. The daily weather is difficult to follow and cumbersome to the eyes.  The map is slow to pull up and the motion doesn’t always work.  I’m now using various other weather apps.  If you bring back the old version or do something to make the app more user friendly I may return.  But as it currently stands - not a chance.
1675,PaytonsPawPrints,"September 21, 2018",1,"Cutting edge or just confusing? TWC, your app has always been my go to for the most accurate weather forecasts. It has always been reliable and easy to understand. I am disappointed in your recent updates. The visual “graphs” you have attempted to create are confusing. I have tried to get used to the new updates as change can be hard. Unfortunately, I am forced to look for a new weather app as yours is no longer user friendly. I appreciate the fact you are attempting to be cutting edge, but bring back the old app! This change is not working for you."

Great info all around in this app. But you have GOT to do something about the constant reset to home as soon as we leave the app. I can be on, let’s say, another city’s air quality details, oops I hit the home screen or click on a text, when I come back I gotta start all over again to get to the “page” I was at.

It’s super slow now! Takes forever to load and sometimes stays stuck on the last location. Cannot save a favorite location. Tries to blame my phone settings but that’s not the problem. Because of that I cannot get severe weather alerts. That’s a big issue! Not near as good visually as before. Another reviewer stated the same thing. Someone either should revise the app or set it up like it was before.
1679,sibeika,"January 24, 2019",5,"Great reports This is a great app. It gives you all the information about the weather, and it tells you if it going to rain or snow or be sunny.

For an alert... who the heck wants their phone to shout out something in a similar tone as an amber alert “an update from KXAN has arrived” unless someone is dying!!!  It happened 3 times today alone, and it was not remotely a bad weather day!  Whoever on your development team thought that was a good idea should be fired.  Can I go in an turn it off, of course, I just did- but why are y’all so dumb to even create it that way to make us do that!  That is so annoying I almost just deleted the app entirely.  Nobody on earth wants that feature- get rid of it!"
1681,rsloan989,"February 17, 2018",1,"If only it actually told the weather I had plans to go to a car meat for a couple weeks when I was finally off work. It’s shows rain on the radar, so I don’t want to take a car that leaks with no wipers out on the road. I’m pretty sure if I wrecked a ‘57 Bel Air, ya’ll wouldn’t pay for it. So what ends up happening? I trust the app and stay home... AND IT DIDNT EVEN SPRINKLE! Now I’m sitting at home emotionally damaged because I could go hang out with all the cool kids with their subie’s and miatas (Chris Wilson), but instead I trusted your app. But it’s cool. I get it, weather shouldn’t be perfect on a weather app. I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed."
1682,Kimi in Kansas,"May 30, 2018",1,"Really disappointing “update”. Loved the weather channel app for years, up until last week when I was forced to go to the newer version. Now an intrusive ad near the bottom is completely in the way of half of the controls, the future radar map freezes constantly and often shows incorrect info such as no activity when it is pouring rain outside. I have depended on this app for years, as I often lose satellite service during storms, but now I will be looking for an alternative. Too bad they can’t leave things that work fine alone."

The full set of current weather data used to be visible with a single tap, but it requires a bit of scrolling to find it in the new version. The hour-by-hour forecasts no longer include as much information as before (most notably to me, the humidity is missing). Finally, the forecasts for the next week or so also omit important information that was included in the older version."
1684,DBS#RD,"August 17, 2018",5,Best weather app! The Weather Channel app is the best!  I prefer it over the weather app that came on my phone.

I also like that the current weather stats include humidity level.  The app is user friendly and reliable.

It seems the focus is now on data collection rather than providing weather information. A long time ago, I paid for this app to get rid of ads. One of the “improvements” basically ripped off the customers who paid money and put the ads back in the app. Now they want me to pay $3.99 per year to collect data on me and sell it to advertisers, with a bit of weather on the side. No thanks, TWC. As with Storm, TWC is no longer on my device"

Easy to set other locations that we travel to or locations that relatives live.  Now, every time you click to it the 7 day forecast is always in a different spot.  You have to hunt for it.  When you’re trying to navigate quickly because of storms and possible tornados, it pops up a game app to download.  Kind of don’t want to play a game when your life is at stake.  Apparently the developer of the app doesn’t live in tornado/Storyville of the Midwest."

I bought the premium a couple years ago to retain the better interface but this latest update is beyond bad.  FULL  of so many ads the screen hardly moves.  And the INTERFACE is SO bad graphically — you changed the nice clean 10-day graph view for bigger fatter fonts and lines and boxes and shading that makes the look completely crowded.  Can also no longer swipe among the cities I have loaded.  Your graphics designers changed things that DIDN’T need changing.  Favorite app now looks like a middle-schooler worked on it.

I mean seriously. How does a torrential rain storm just pop up out of nowhere when this app is predicting 0% rain???? Get your $#!t together people!!

It used to be a well designed app and now the way the info is displayed is just terrible. Any chance of me upgrading has gone out the window after the terrible user interface changes and the sheer annoyance with the badgering to upgrade causing me to make it a point to not do so.

I deleted and reinstalled the app and the hourly forecasts worked again but without the extended forecasts. I re-established my premium service at the App Store and now it is logging off again when I try to get the hourly forecast. I contacted customer service last week without reply.   I am canceling my premium service.

I was really sad when the Weather Channel unilaterally killed off the old Storm app in favor of this thing. Knowing I had no real choice,I made myself use the new app and slowly accepted the ads and the rather unfriendly interface. Now just when I really needed to track a round of severe weather, all my options are locked out. Seriously now. Is this a way to make the user base happy? Not thinking so."

No more quick glancing at the forecast you have this wanna be fancy looking weather that is not user friendly. And your videos play the same stupid commercial over and over again, I get it you got to pay the bills, but at least mix some different advertising in.

They’re pushing you to watch clickbaited mediocre unrelated videos, each of which play a 15 second unskippable ad before the video starts. The app is cluttered with ads and it’s hard to find the information you actually need. It seems to me like they intentionally put ads in certain places where you’ll accidentally tap the ad, generating them more revenue. And this latest fake Hurricane video with that horrible acting, that was the last straw."

If I switch to the radar view to get an idea of what’s coming half the time I see a clear map as if it were bright & sunny.  Right now it is down pouring & my radar shows no rain.

Go back to your old format that let the data be looked at, at a glance without being annoying. The colors are too light and the data doesn’t stand it, either. You need to put in some contrast. Whoever designed this new format should be moved to another department,"

I’ve tried to get used to it but just dislike it very much.  I will be deleting this app and using the iPhone weather app unless they change this new design.

There are a lot of accurate weather apps available so I’m going to use one of those and delete this one. I wish they’d fix what needs to be fixed and quit trying to “fix” what doesn’t need fixing."

The interface is rife with sensational clickbait articles, so you have to scroll and scroll to find the information you’re actually looking for. I don’t know why I keep using this app, I guess I have some sort of allegiance to the Weather Channel because I grew up relying on local on the 8s for the forecast. Maybe I should go back to using that instead of this."

It’s neither “carefully crafted” nor “beautifully designed”; it’s difficult to find the answers I used to find easily.

Trying to find the information I want is painful.  You used to be able to swipe across to see the day to day highs and lows.  Now you have to scroll down a page to see more than two days.  Want a particular day hour by hour?  You used to click on the day and voila!  Now you have to find the hourly at the bottom of the app. I have always loved the Weather Channel, but I’m ready to switch now."
1744,SScamilleon,"October 10, 2018",2,"New update not for me I don’t understand why the app changed from their old design to this. The experience is less intuitive, and the icons are small and bland along their plain white page. On top of that, TWC app hasn’t been very reliable on weather accuracy. Countless times, I have been in the middle of a downpour while the current weather and radar shows no rain in the vicinity. I finally caved in and purchased the Carrot Weather App, which has already shown to be far more accurate."
1745,J_Freddie,"October 16, 2018",1,"No stars I’m done.  The Weather Channel app has been my “go to” app for literally YEARS.  This latest “update” has left me with an app that will only LAUNCH 23% of the time. (19 out of 83 launches....yes, I counted)  Regardless of how wonderful the app might be, if over 80% of the time one is looking at a blank, blue screen, it’s pretty useless.  This behavior has occurred beginning with IOS 11, and now 12, on four different IPhones (6, 7, 8 and 8 plus).  I have uninstalled, reinstalled, and changed phones, with the same results.  Today, I’m done.  Deleted the app.  Goodbye.  Look elsewhere for your weather app."

Unfortunately, since the latest version update, I find it almost unusable. The interface is not clear at all, the sections all run together, and it’s far less user-friendly. I’ve been super disappointed, and keep hoping that they will send out another update going back to a format more like what they used to have."

I keep accidentally clicking on advertisements and then I have to close the app and open it again.  It’s harder to read now also.  I only use it once in a while now.  I actually deleted it for a while because I was so frustrated.  I even went back to just watching local news for the weather.  Sorry weather channel, you guys really screwed up what was an actually pretty decent and useful app."

I have my location on and all that and I get notifications all the time that whatever weather event will begin at whatever time. Well I understand that a couple to few minutes off is ok as storms can slow down or speed up, ok fine. But when I get notifications that says ,as was tonight, “rain will begin at 7:20” and it’s raining heavily at 6:00 that’s a good bit different. It wasn’t just tonight it happens all the time.  I have no trust in this app for accuracy."

Don’t like the new access to different parts of the app, can’t find where to change map view to satellite view, also there’s a thunderstorm right over my house and there is absolutely no indication on The Weather Channel’s app that anything is going on! Local stations indicate what’s happening! Glad I’ve got those!!! Just not a promising update!!!"

1752,AnnaKNYC,"September 1, 2018",1,"Disappointed I downloaded your latest update. It’s ok, there’s a lot of fiddling to find what I need but I can live with that. But who thought that a white background was a good idea?! I don’t see an option for changing it to a different color. I can’t be the only one constantly dimming my phone because it’s too bright. Anything with a white background is a disaster. I suffer from migraines, just like over 30mln Americans, and check the weather constantly as it affects my health. I will be switching to a different app with a more friendly layout and colors that don’t give me a headache."

It’s hard to read, I’m just looking for the weather. You’ve used valuable screen space within the app to provide a squiggly line to show highs and lows. I can figure out the highs and lows by reading the numbers that have shrunk to make room for a useless line. Does it do what the intent is, yes. Content, great. Delivery, terrible."

I don’t want to have to scroll through days on end to get a glimpse of what the weather will be for a few days out. Why did you take away the ability to see the weather for a week at once glance?

1756,WxCMK,"September 8, 2018",1,"Just worthless since the update Why mess with a good thing? The old app format worked great. Now it’s confusing to navigate. Too many clicks to get to what you want and the details are hidden in places that make it difficult to find. On top of that, it only loads about 25% of the time and when it does load, the lag for each click is beyond annoying. "

Also, I could care less if it’s going to rain on me for six minutes in about twenty minutes....tell me if a Tornado is going to blow my house away, otherwise, leave me along. One more thing that has nothing to do with the App. Can you PLEASE tell your weather channel TV personalities that there are many, many ways to express, “as well”.  I’ll not name the person but he/she said “as well” nine times in 45 seconds. At least give ME a break!"
1758,DebTip,"September 18, 2018",1,Hate New Version This app is awful and I’m going to try a different weather app.    I really hate the hourly and daily “roller coaster” display.   The info is so small and hard to see.   I want a list view — and not just the current large one that doesn’t give you a good overall view of the daily info.   The Weather Channel is has also been very disappointing — you can’t count on seeing your weather on the 8s because it’s only on at certain times.  I can’t figure out the schedule so I don’t go to that channel very much anymore for the weather.   Really too bad.
1759,Dadthedad,"September 24, 2018",2,"Weather channel app update Thank you for updating my weather app. I hate it!  The new changes are horrible.

I loved the simplicity of the old app. In this one I have to scroll forever to find what I need and all the stuff on the screen makes it hard for me to identify what I want plus everything is so small. Blah, hate this new version, please go back to the style of the last one. I  will continue to use the old version until it no longer works. Then I will go find another weather app that suits me better. This one is awful."

Occasionally the stories below are interesting, but are usually just click bait."
1763,R_warf,"May 29, 2018",1,Killing my watch I couldn’t understand why my Apple Watch went from being able to last two days before needing a charge to not even lasting a full day. It seemed like it happened over night. I kept getting rain notifications on my watch from the weather channel app. I turned off the notifications but that didn’t help. I deleted the app from my watch last night and put it on the charger. I’ve been wearing my watch for 7 1/2 hours now and it’s still at 100%. I came to realize that the night that I spoke of was the night it upgraded.

1765,DocShasta,"August 29, 2018",2,"HATE the new platform “with Watson”!! I will discontinue use of the weather Channel app now that it has changed. It was easy to use and in a logical format before, but now that it is labeled “with Watson”, it crashes, can’t get my local weather, and is difficult to navigate with individual windows for data. It is harder for my eyes to read the print, and it’s not visually appealing at all. I guess the data options are the same, but I couldn’t get the app to stay up long enough to check before it crashed! 😖😑"
1766,manner84,"August 30, 2018",1,"Horrible Why did you feel the need to change the whole layout? This app was fairly decent before at least in the way information was displayed but now with the “update” there is so much junk going on on the screen that it makes it hard to find what you want quickly. I don’t want to scroll through 7 pages of junk to find today’s weather, extended forecast, radar and sometimes pollen levels. Stop trying to make things fancier, it’s a weather app you just need an accurate forecast and current conditions. That’s it."
1767,dont like wind direction arrow,"April 19, 2020",4,"Love the radar map I’ve been using this app for several years now. The radar shows 6 hours time frame which is important to me, if it could do 8 that’d be even better. However, I do not like the tiny pointy arrow for wind direction. I prefer the original letters ex: N= north, NW = northwest. The arrow tells me nothing! I’m not a meteorologist so I don’t understand which direction it is pointing. Just keep it simple and go back to letters PLEASE."

In addition, users are provided with an option to “Go Premium” and when you select it, there still isn’t the option to remove the ads for $3.99 as listed in the In-App Purchase section in the App Store.

1770,bkblake,"January 7, 2020",1,"Weak development and support I originally purchased the Weather Channel Max app to get rid of the ads, and it was great until they stopped updating it and it stopped working on IOS 8.  You can't offer an ad free version requiring extra money, then abandon those purchasers and only support and update the version with ads.  That is unless you want to refund my money...  oh and then a year or two later, re-release the stupid premium app and ask for money again.  This is BS and all the constant begging for me to upgrade every time I open the free version made me dump this garbage."
1771,itootdaflute1584,"December 29, 2019",2,Notification Issues This is a nice app when it works right. The weather is bad at the moment. I am under a tornado watch and a severe thunderstorm warning. I got a notification with a severe weather statement but it won’t open. Either I get a blank screen or it takes me to a list of the current warnings. Pretty frustrating because I feel like I may be missing something important. And then you want me to pay for presuming features when the free version doesn’t even seem to work right? 🙄
1772,Lekfx,"December 22, 2019",1,"This app is broken It is so badly designed for user experience. I tried endlessly to edit my profile, trying to delete three “home” locations from the past, and it would not allow any of that. There is even a message displayed saying “we only allow one home location”!. It would not delete ANY of them, even when I deleted the address, name, everything. It would not save ANY changes. Their website is broken too. It was unresponsive and would not display my KNOWN and REGISTERED locations, and would not display a sign-in! I’m done with this app."
1773,Snowman2018,"December 20, 2019",5,Flu alert I really like this app but I would like to turn off the flu alert. I get my shot every year. Its a great reminder but I would like to be able to read the screen as it makes it harder for me to read the screen. If I am unable to turn it off how about it just fades away after 15 or 20 seconds.
1774,Xankae-Mabon,"November 27, 2019",2,"It works, but... It gives decent information. The downside is that it is pretty slow compared to other weather apps. Also it is a clear money grab. There used to be loads of fake/scam adds, there probably still are. They like to hype the weather, trying to make it seem worse than it is just to keep you watching. Not surprising since that has always been their MO on the tv channel. I only use it for the radar, the rest of the app we are all better off ignoring."
1775,Mr. Lettuce,"November 26, 2019",1,"Adds to death Fix your app.   For those of us who are not interested in getting duped into paying for nothing, allow us the option to turn off your annoying prompts to “upgrade to premium”.   I get the information I need for free and if you don’t fix this, I’ll go elsewhere to get my free information.  In addition to that, I’m not interested in watching a 30 second “non skippable” add to watch your 30 second video clips.   I’ll pass altogether.  "

1777,TPendarakis,"October 27, 2019",3,No customer support I purchased the $3.99 Ad-free version but still got ads. I upgraded to the $9.99 premium version but still get ads on my iPad. There is no way to prevent the videos from auto playing and the videos don’t coincide with the audio. I’ve written for customer support no less than three times and have never gotten a reply. Other than those things I would be happy with the app. I like the content. It is thoughtful and appropriate.
1778,1Tabitha22,"July 25, 2019",1,Slow and laggy! This app is terrible!  It lags out and closes all of the time.  It takes forever for it to load completely.  There are far too many ads that wreck the app and make it unusable half of the time.  I just want to get the weather and instead I am waiting a couple of minutes for the app to actually load and then I have to scroll through 5 ads to finally get to my radar!  Not worth using anymore until they fix their issues!  Their website isn’t any better so I am not surprised their app is this terrible
1779,76514567890,"July 19, 2019",1,What the actual... Can someone please explain to me how a heat warning is more important than a tornado watch? You couldn’t display all of the warnings and weather watches on one page? Instead you hide them some place that no one would think to look. Is advertising space seriously more important than people’s safety?

I love this app I use it everyday however, since the air quality all over the Bay Area and California in general have been seeing the biggest wildfire in California history affecting many areas due to smoke air pollution and actual fires spreading to their own areas. I suggest that The Weather Channel should update their air pollution meter more often and make it a part of the main/top notifications on the app."

I find it extremely hard to read and it looks so confusing! It may just me the fact that I am a disabled veteran with a TBI, gotta throw in a reasonable dispute for them, but I highly doubt it!

It’s not actively bad but I preferred the previous version. My big issue though is the crashiness of this version. I’ve had it crash so bad twice now, that I had to remove the app from my phone and reinstall it because it wouldn’t launch after crashing. Not sure how many more times I want to do that."

This becomes particularly cumbersome when abroad where data plans are usually not unlimited. Lots to fix here. Snap to it - or I may look elsewhere."

Maybe I could understand this if the quality of the app was better, but just look at the app, try it out, and you’ll see that it’s sub-par. I’ve contacted support to ask for a refund but I’m doubtful that will happen. If it does I’ll update this review; otherwise, this app is terrible.

Just switched to this new version of my old favorite weather app when I got the notification the old one was being retired. Worked for almost an hour to try to figure out how to swipe between my 5 favorite cities, before reading these reviews and figuring out that that feature no longer exists. I will really miss it. Can’t you put that feature back? Check out all the reviews of people who relied on that feature."

It say that storms will start at 10:00 then it doesn’t so then it moves to 11:00 then it doesn’t happen then so it moves to 12:00 you get at this point. I’m annoyed because it confuses me in when they’re coming just pick the time!

But I really wish they’d fix the time stamp on the radar! That’s what makes it useful- to estimate the storm front velocity. It disappeared on the most recent update. Also, in the news stories, the links don’t work and you can’t zoom in on the pictures/photos, on my iPhone."

Complete craziness. Thankfully there are other weather apps out there to use (like Windy), and I will have to reprogram my brain to get used to their interfaces. Way to ruin one of the most used apps, Weather Channel app devs! Time for you to go back to design & usability school."

1811,JFlory101,"December 9, 2019",1,Go premium Every time you open the app they beg you to upgrade. Every time you open the radar and there’s precipitation in the area them it begs you to go premium. If you want everyone on premium then cancel the free version. When I’m driving down the road and there’s some weather in front of me and I want a quick look at what it is then I don’t want to have to find the x to close out the go premium screen.  Another thing is the little pop-up menu on the radar. It makes it very hard to zoom in and out even with the menu closed.
1812,Talkie,"November 27, 2019",1,"Too Aggressive on Ads & Purchases. The app now is full of too many advertisements. I used to be able to get information clearly on previous versions. It seems like every time that I open it, I’m being offered new features for money. I’d rather have the free version that comes with iPhones than this. $10/year isn’t worth it for seeing lightning 30 miles away instead of 10 miles away for free. I’d hate to be in an emergency and have to pay for life-saving information, because I have a hunch that’s the direction the company is steering users into."

I for one just want to enjoy my coffee and watch the radar and check my weather without an annoying premium add popping up. It was definitely a five star app before premium started getting pushed."

I don’t know what’s going on, but opening this app always takes more than one try - more time than it should take me. I’ve never had problems on any other devices.

I hope somebody fixes this, it’s such a step backwards for this app!"
1819,Maxbender,"July 9, 2019",1,Developed by Russia When one looks at all the other weather apps available with beautiful graphics and easy to access information - this app is complete garbage. Obviously this app is built to serve ads and not much else. Not user friendly at all. The Weather Channel is also starting to drop support to provide 3rd party apps weather information. So one can see where this is heading. What they should be doing is letting 3rd party developers build their app instead. But when you start to (allowed to) monopolize - its no longer about the customer.

Takes forever to show any data, yet all my other weather apps are instant. It just did another upgrade/bug fix and it locked on ""weather snapshot"" or whatever that stupid new screen is. ""x"" won't close that, neither will ""get started"". I just now deleted it permanently and will stick with ""weather underground"". At least it works and doesn't lock the screen. Go back to the drawing board and start over. Please."

The functionality to look at several days is not functional as well. The left to right scrolling is much more cumbersome than the previous version. The last update has completely shut the app down. I can no longer open it. Farewell Weather Channel App, I’ve been force by your poor performance to move on to other apps."

Why can’t I continue my life while I just check out the weather really quick? I hate that you have to click around just to get tomorrow’s weather. Or today’s am-pm weather. Or literally anything other than the temperature right this minute. The “news” articles are just annoying clickbait. The radar is TERRIBLE now and only works like 10% of the time. Come on.

It’s now real work to see the weather.  Who wants to analyze graphs/charts at 6am?! Weather Channel app used to be on my home screen.

The developers may think its great because they spent so much time creating it but let it go folks. Your users hate it. I used to look at this app several times a day. Now?  Couple times a week. Nothing is “at a glance” anymore. The format & color scheme are hard on the eyes and it’s just annoying to navigate. We can figure out HOW to navigate it folks. We just dont want to.

Before you could find the 5 day or 10 day forecast easy and I liked how they had the picture of what the weather was doing. Finding the percentage of rain chance is horrible now, too. Someone really dropped the ball on this new design.  I stopped using this app and just use the one on my phone but I’m really disappointed. I wish they would bring back the old version. So until then or big changes goodbye Weather Channel."

1872,Mary Warren7,"August 21, 2018",4,Dependable This app is useful when I am out of town or just planning a day at home. No forecast is 100% accurate. This changes as weather patterns move closer. The system alerts and distance to lightning strikes provide a means to understand the general conditions where I am located at the time. The videos can be watched if desired. A forecast on any medium changes as the general conditions gain momentum and storms develop.
1873,Dessias,"August 27, 2018",5,"Redesign is huge improvement The new redesign is a huge improvement over old version. Clean, easy to use, and shows you at a glance what you want to know, crucially while not making the detail hard to get to. I’d written this app off a long time ago, but new version makes it one of better apps out there."
1874,Dogloverrus12,"August 28, 2018",1,Why just why did you have to change the app? I have to say I hate this new update its hard to read and understand as well as very confusing I did give it some time to see if my opinion would change since I first updated it but I must say I barley even look at this app anymore I used to check it several times a day that’s how good it was I don’t know who’s idea it was to change it but I say fire them and return the app to the old much easier to read and understand app this one is not a winner and I see lots of others feel the same
1875,just the weather please,"September 1, 2018",2,New version of app loads too slow Three days ago my weather channel app interface changed and it is now very slow to load. Probably all those videos loading that i do not care to see tried it for three days with same sluggish behavior not ok for an app i paid for to avoid ads.   I now loaded another weather app that loads immediately and tells me about weather first thing!  Weather channel now seems to be a social media site and not for me. Goodbye weather channel.
1876,jenboyce220,"September 1, 2018",1,"Horrible change This used to be a great app. It is now horrible. I accept believe someone get paid to make this changes. The information is not well organized. It is difficult to find what you need and there  is nothing intuitive about this app. The old app was so good because I could get up in the morning check the app before my morning run and know everything I needed in less than 5 seconds. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!!!!! Please    This new app is the worst model ever created. The last addition was brilliant. Find the woman or man who created that one, it was a winner."
1877,Flybabyapril,"September 9, 2018",2,Disappointed—too much like others App was recently updated and is not useful for me any longer. It looks a great deal like another app I downloaded LONG ago (years!) and I never used that app because the way the data was displayed was not useful. Now I actually have gone BACK to using the other app because it has the UV index and barometric pressure even though it is difficult to find and the weather info is not displayed in an easy-to-use manner. I am in process of hunting yet another app now.

Also I enjoy the different videos that you can watch and I like that you can check the cold and flu score in your area or in areas where you have family or where you may be visiting!! Very easy to use as well!! Highly recommend this app it’s a must to have this app! Thanks!!
1881,CBM247,"January 25, 2018",5,"Depend On It The Weather App is my “Go To” Source for Weather. Radar marks My Location with a “Flashing Bullseye” for Storms, Lightning & Rain. Notifications alert me to Storms, Rain, etc. And, if the alert states, “Rain will be moving into your location by 4:00pm; well, count on it. I use the App on Trips to follow weather along the way. More accurate than my Local TV Stations! Get It!"
1882,Scottsmithppi,"April 1, 2018",4,"Disappointed I farm and have relied on this app for weather forecast that I base major farming decisions on. Now that has become more difficult. The 10 day forecast  is now not reliable. You have to look at each day for the true forecast. For example “Tuesday” says 20%, if you click on the day it says 20% and the ‘night’ says 100%. Since when is nighttime not part of the day of Tuesday?"
1883,James Manzano,"April 21, 2018",4,"Okay Map The map, when zoomed out a certain amount, gets rid of the rain in just a certain area. There is still rain there because if you zoom out, or in more, it appears again; but there is a sort of dead spot in the magnification."

At least give us the option to choose how locations are listed."

I paid my money for the Premium subscription, but only had it for about one minute, then it reverted to the standard version of the app (with constant ads to Go Premium).  I reached out to their Help three times, received three emails saying they’d get back to me, and several months later I still have heard  nothing.  I even tried to re-subscribe - was willing to pay twice - but they tell me I’m already a Premium member."

Here’s an ad! Want to get out of hourly and go back to the home page? Have another ad! What? You need to look at the radar? Ad, ad, ad!!! Oh, you purchased the ad free version? Well here’s an ad anyway. Bye Weather Channel."
1888,depechian,"February 12, 2020",1,Terrible app full of useless dribble! Bring back the previous useful version! I have hated this version since it was released.  The old version was much easier to read and get the info you wanted at a glance!  I kept using the old version up until this week until some moron decided to finally kill it.  Time to find an easy to use app that is not full of unnecessary info    One positive I do like are the rain alerts though. So I’ll let this run in the background for that alone.... so disappointed in how this once useful app was ruined.
1889,Eng grad,"January 25, 2020",1,"New is not always better I loved the weather channel app I had on my IPad until a few days ago. It was quick to download.  I don’t need info from all over the world, but it was easy to click on that if I wanted that news.  The older version was so easy to see and change cities, easy access to radar. This new one has TOO much information and is too slow to download it all. I HATE IT. Why do software engineers feel they always have to change a good thing? I am going to try to find a more user-friendly site for my weather."

I guess if I understood what each one of their cloud icons meant, that would help, but why should I have to learn it?  The percentages used to be there. What a step backwards.

Every so often the favorites will be gone and so the alerts since it is locations dependency. The app didn’t crash favorites just keep disappearing for no reason. Uninstalled and reinstalled didn’t help. Just bugs that never get fixed. Also it takes forever for app to load. When it worked it is good but it is frustrating not to have a reliable app.
1897,Teresa from NJ,"July 18, 2019",5,I plan my day with this app Living in Florida it rains most everyday in the summer this app is accurate and tells me exactly what time every day it’s going to rain and it’s exact so my hair always looks beautiful and I’m always equipped with an umbrella exactly when it rains and I know when to go to the beach and what to expect because it’s always right. GREAT. THANK YOU
1898,Kbdepew,"July 1, 2019",3,Great idea but crashes consistently I have had The Weather Channel app for many years and over the past year I have noticed it’s reliability go downhill. About 50% of the time I try to use it the app either just shows me a blue screen and never fully open is it crashes. I thought it might be my phone but my husband has the same problem. It’s unfortunate because I love the features of The Weather Channel app!

I wouldn’t care about the ads if I didn’t pay for the app and I don’t care about a few here and there, but what was my $5.99 for????  Now they want $9.99 per year for the premium app...  96 hour forecast...  they don’t even 12 hours from very accurate so who cares what they’ll get wrong 4 days from now!"

It frequently crashes on opening, radar is extremely slow to load past or future tracking, if it will do it at all and don’t even think about zooming out to see the radar of a larger area- it won’t work.  With so many options available these days, you would think The Weather Channel would have the best available.  Sadly, not the case.  My local news apps do a far better job with radar and storm tracking."
1905,Homeburger88,"April 11, 2019",1,Not much weather Imagine having a weather app to allow people to see the main things they care about... Temperature and chance of rain. If you care about any of that then this ain’t the app. Get back to basics weather channel. Give us the percentage of rain (for each day - simple - not a 16 page article on how it might not rain... you guys are always wrong anyways. Just give us the percentage) and the daily temps like the stock weather app does. 
1906,Threatened user,"April 12, 2019",2,"Not happy, quality going down with updates. After being bombarded with ads, I decided that I would pay a little extra to make it go away.  Now that has disappeared, the latest updates have caused the past radar history, and the future radar history to become inoperable.  Can only see current radar.  That makes it pretty much useless.  Wrote them, and haven’t heard anything back.  Maybe it is becoming time to try another weather app?"

1908,Aye Q,"May 26, 2019",5,Still unpredictable It’s really not the apps fault but relying on applications to predict the weather has ruined today for me it almost promised severe thunderstorms and lots of rain and not one drop of rain has fallen. Weather is still so unpredictable what more do you need besides the stock weather app on your iPhone and a window to look out of.
1909,Galaxy214,"May 28, 2019",4,"Good, could use some improvements. This app for me at least is very good, although with Thunderstorms, sometimes storm tracks don’t show up, and then I can’t tell if a storm that is about to hit me is a hail storm, heavy rain etc. Lightning detecting works pretty well though, until the power goes out, lol. But, besides the storm tracks sometimes not working, it’s a pretty good app for weather and radar."

When I want to do a quick check I don’t like that you have search to find the tab you want. It’s much easier to just scroll where you want to be then click to get more info.  Very disappointed with the upgrade!

But here it goes...This most recent change (a month or so ago) is HORRIBLE (however, completely my opninon)!! Your app was my go-to for weather before, but now it is the last resource. I REALLY preferred the prior format. Maybe they were trying to make it like the other apps, but the reason I used yours before was because of the layout! Not anymore!!! I hate the temperature format, and quite honestly, ALL  of the changes!! Please go back!!! 🙏🏻"
1916,QFinnie,"October 10, 2018",2,The new version I am so disappointed with the new app - I used to check this app many times a day and now I rarely do because the new way of presenting data is just not visually great.  It now appears like a graph of the days/weather/temps rather than the old visual of 7-10 days much like seen on tv with a picture of what the weather would be and the high/low.  Visually the new layout is just confusing and hard to process/figure out what day it is referring to and what the weather will be!
1917,michegl,"October 12, 2018",1,"Do you lost your mind? Dont you read the reviews? Dont you talk on the street? Everybody is HATING this facelift that you gave to a former wonderful and helpful app. Everybody I know is complaining and looking for/already using another weather app.  We want back our information plain and simple - and if you want the details you click and dig around the app. Now, its the opposite! Now, it’s just one of the most annoying apps to handle. TWC screw up badly in this design. Give us an option to go back to the old one and I’m coming back to your app. If not, by bye forever."
1918,Cowboy Junkie,"November 15, 2018",1,"When designers attack The update to this app, which I have relied on for about 10 years, is what happens when you let graphic designers control how something fairly straightforward should look. The weather data should legible and easy to access. It doesn’t need to be cute. It needs to deliver important information to people whose lives and livelihoods are affected by inclement weather. I am usually adaptable and flexible with changes and improvements, but not all changes are improvements. Whomp. Deleting and looking for a new weather app."
1919,Crash carmon,"January 17, 2019",2,New layout I have found that I don’t use this app anymore since the latest update. When the former was changed from a vertical look to a horizontal scroll for weather and temperature I found it hard to use. 
1920,tiffmarie,"June 17, 2018",4,"Forecast accuracy The app itself works fine, but lately the forecasts have been way off:  days with a 0% chance of rain being stormy, the temperatures being way off. I know that weather is in general finicky and hard to predict, but I feel like the accuracy used to be better. But I still use the app every day—I just wish the predictions were a little closer to reality."
1921,GSeals,"August 28, 2018",3,"Maybe I just hate change - this two year old review is still accurate The recent update is worse than ever. It was nice, in the previous version, to see the ""quick & dirty"" high/low forecast for the coming week - now it's a scroll-through affair with no semblance to a calendar. This change was apparently made for the sake of change. As always, when severe weather is about, the maps remain very sluggish."
1922,Mark Review 2018,"August 29, 2018",5,Love the new version Finally what I was looking for in a weather app. Previous versions were frustrating and had too much social/news junk.

1924,TomsBogy,"August 31, 2018",1,"Bring back the old format I rarely bother to write reviews but the latest version of this app is the worst update I've ever seen. The previous version was simple and easy to use. This new update is anything but useful. I used to enjoy the 48hr forecast as well as the 15 day one. Sure, they sometimes missed a forecast but the information was gererall useful for planning purposes. The new formats just don't convey useful forecast information. If this app doesn't revert back to the previous version, I'll be looking for another one that is simple and easy to use."
1925,NotThatKevinSmith,"September 1, 2018",1,"Poor update design This most recent update to the look and layout of the app has made it much more complicated than it needs to be. Before, you were able to find all of the weather information on one page, in an easy to read layout. But now, the info is spread throughout numerous slides and advertisements. Unfortunately I’m going to be using a different weather app, even though I’ve been a fan of TWC’s apps for a long time. Hopefully they revert/change their app design to make it more practical instead of just visually appealing."
1926,Green Doggy,"September 2, 2018",1,"Worst app update EVER!! Today’s revamped Weather Channel app for iPhone is the WORST! The easy-to-use functionality and lovely blue backgrounds are gone in favor of a disgusting white wash-out. The simple, extended day forecast of the previous version is now a confusing hot mess with the high and low temperatures so close to each other that it’s difficult to decipher and users must scroll for numerous pages now just to see the extended summaries. I have never hated an app update more than this! Jettison this piece of crap and bring back the previous Weather Channel app or I will delete this garbage!"
1927,mikeyb1016,"September 2, 2018",1,"Everything but the weather. Terrible since the redesign.  Everything is jammed up and there is lack of any contrast.  I want to know what the weather is, what the radar looks like, etc.  I don’t want to see crap like “everything was fine, and 15 seconds later THIS happened.  I don’t want to see graphs either, unless I want to see charts and graphs.  Feel like I’m back in 8th grade math class browsing on my packard bell.  I’m looking elsewhere like many others and won’t be returning.  Forecasts are getting more inaccurate as well.  This is the single most important factor."
1928,Axp896,"September 3, 2018",4,Hard to read Version 10.0.  Too hard to find the daily high or low temp.  When I open the app I can easily see the current temp but the forecast daily high (or nightly low if later in the day) is too small to read and hidden in the written out forecast.  I have to click the daily forecast tab to actually see the forecast temp.  Minor complaint but it annoys me.
1929,MarkDownMark,"September 5, 2018",1,"Worst Update Ever This latest update is unfortunately trash.  They took what little good was in the old app and tried to make it all pretty.  What they’ve actually done is made a useless app that is extremely difficult to navigate.  I know that you should give some burn in time to learn the new app but after over a week, the app is now being deleted as it’s almost unusable and very difficult to find anything useful.  Fix it and I might come back.  A little less focus on the clickbaiting videos and ads more focus on the user interface."

They don’t even show up as saved, they’re “Recent.”  The previous version was point and click to expand your options.

I can go to the website if I want this format."
1932,SchroederRock,"May 7, 2018",3,Good app that annoys me Design and function are all good. Plenty of data in one app to get you by. However my major complaint is that somehow weather condition notifications keep getting re-enabled. I had all but severe weather disabled and after several weeks I see I have 3 notification enabled. I figured that out because I was alerted every time a light passing shower may come thru. Annoyed the heck out of me so I deleted the app and went elsewhere.
1933,Maine-ah,"June 4, 2018",5,"Go back, you blew it ! Glitchy and choppy. Previous version was fine the way it was, but you had to go and “improve” it...

1938,MichaelCoe,"March 28, 2020",1,"Watch app won’t connect No matter how good the app wants to claim to be. If it refuses to connect to The Weather Channel servers than it is worthless. The iPhone app works but is very slow and super pushy about buying an upgrade.  This purchase is hard to justify when features do not work from jump (such as the watch app companion).  There are a few great apps that provide weather info and updates. So it becomes necessary that in order to win over customers you need features that work and provide confidence.  This app fails to meet these standards, thus 1 star."

Like the older version where you could toggle between current temp and weather for the day, hour by hour.  Cannot figure out if it is possible /how to add other cities to be able to check on family.  Takes forever to load, if it loads at all.  All in all, not an upgrade, but a downgrade."

1942,ejmac5,"January 23, 2020",1,"Don’t bother with Premium I paid for Premium primarily to get rid of the many ads that make the entire app clogged with unnecessary and irritating content. Although they were happy to take my money, they refused to answer multiple email inquiries to help reset the app to Premium. I dug deeper a few days later, and found a link to ask for a refund. I quickly got a response that I was not eligible for a refund. No explanation. And still no response to my earlier inquiry. I’ve done all I can. Would not recommend unless you want to throw away your money."
1943,GLF77,"January 14, 2020",2,"More marketing than meteorology This app embeds beautifully in the Apple weather app. I used to click on it for extended forecasts and radar. But now I am overwhelmed at how some information is withheld to encourage premium membership, such as displaying a pop up that there may be lightning strikes nearby and to go premium to find out. The non-premium information provided always comes with ads. I will look for other sources for weather information and no longer rely on this platform for marketing."
1944,Jeffrey Jeff Jefferson,"January 7, 2020",1,"Overrated This app used to be great a handful of years ago. No ads, no annoying videos, just weather. Now, you have to scroll and scroll to find the information you’re looking for. Also, you used to be able to have an hourly forecast up to 48 hours in the future. Now you have to buy the premium subscription to get more than 16 hours in the future. $10/year just to get a decent weather forecast?! RIDICULOUS. That’s $800 over the course of an average person’s life paid to a money-grabbing and greedy conglomerate. Shame on you TWC"
1945,Jambfcde,"January 4, 2020",2,"Full of bugs Wont update forecasts.   You think you are looking at the current weather but its from two  days ago and it can not be made to refresh.

Has several imaginary locations, can’t be told its using the wrong default  location, so one has to spell it out."

I ride a motorcycle, and I’m a school bus driver. When I left my house for my afternoon route at around 2pm, there was a zero percent chance of rain. Three hours later I’m driving in freezing rain. The only thing predictable about the weather with this pathetic app, is that it can’t predict anything, ever. I can’t imagine why anyone would pay to upgrade to get forecast beyond 10 days when they fail beyond 10 hours."

You’ve had them on there for long enough now and please don’t have ANY advertisements that last so long! 30 seconds is much too long to listen to somebody yelling at you which is essentially what they are doing. I’d rather not look at your news than have to listen to them.
1954,Mrs. Tackle box,"August 30, 2019",1,Never accurate This app is rarely accurate. It said sunny right now and it’s currently raining. The temp is the only thing that’s pretty accurate right now. The forecasts are always off. And the radar is as well. It only shows current conditions right after the weather has changed it didn’t show any rain in the forecast for today and as I said it’s currently pouring. Please update and fix this issue I have used this app for years and over the past year it has been useless. I rarely check it anymore I use my local stations.

Every time you update the software, it erases all my saved locations and settings. I’ll save the locations again, and it still won’t allow me to turn on the alerts. It keeps saying that I have to allow location services for the app on the phone  I HAVE! I have never disallowed location services. I have to delete and re-download the app to fix this EVERY. SINGLE.

Every time I attempt to check the weather I’m met with an upgrade pop up and then multiple ads throughout checking the weather. I’m aware at this point that I can pay to upgrade, I get it, don’t need it and can’t afford it anyways so why the need to ask so many times?!? This app was so much better before this became a thing, you guys pushing the upgrade on us. I guess it’s time to find a less pushy weather app."

This weather app is definitely one of my favorites."

I hate the home view which is a view of the current date in 6 hour blocks - this is not useful!  I either want to know the hourly forecast for the current day, or I want to know the multi day forecast.  Aside from being slow to load, the radar feature is useful"
1960,sfgefhy,"November 18, 2018",1,The Old 4.5.1 was Way Better Up to version 10.2 still no better than 9.10! Concur with numerous other posters...The old 4.5.1 allowed to to select airports by their three letter identifiers. It was great for those who travel a lot.  You could get the weather at the airports themselves so you could see if you might have weather problems while traveling.
1961,Kentuckyroots,"December 15, 2018",5,"A Necessary App! I love The Weather Channel app. I get updates every morning about the day’s weather, can see the map of rainfall in my area ,or any other weather news .I like knowing what to expect the rest of the day or evening, concerning the weather.

When the new update came out I hated it, but I try to be open minded, and know it takes time to adjust to new things, but now after several months of trying to adjust it didn’t happen. Please bring back back something more like the old layout and stop with so many videos & things I have to move past in order to get to the info I need."
1963,DesiDesmond,"February 25, 2019",1,"Used to love this app Used to love this app. Now it just annoys me. It keeps becoming more and more difficult to find what you want. The horizontal scrolling is terrible, you have to figure out which is a real link and which is crap unrelated to today’s weather, and most annoying of all is that 1/2 the page is weather and 1/2 the page is crappy advertising. No wonder they had to go to horizontal scrolling. I’m currently looking for a replacement app, even if I have to pay. It’s just turned into a difficult to use annoying app. Too bad."
1964,Concerned-about-reality,"March 12, 2019",4,"Great info from Weather Channel Just too overboard on the human contribution to global warming. I believe we should be prudent, but also believe that if all human effects stopped, the natural cycle would NOT be reversed. Perhaps some diligence is worthy, but let the animals pass gas! So totally and unapologetically overboard with the human contribution! Ice caps gone by 2015 Al Gore? Get a realistic perspective and let’s work out what makes feasible sense for the planet and our economy!"
1965,The Stump Man,"March 25, 2019",5,Arkansas weather. I like being to bring up the weather Channel to see what the weather is going to be like that day.

Yet there is nothing there to scroll through, and even when I try to scroll....there is nothing there. I can’t"
1970,AdrienneNJ,"September 9, 2018",1,"Terrible The only app review I’ve ever written. I feel compelled to do so, because the new version is so not user friendly.  Now it is way too difficult to take in the weekly forecast at a glance.  Don’t force me to take a deeper dive!  I don’t want the daily low to be displayed as prominently as the daily high.  I’ve already forgotten Monday’s forecast by the time my eyes make it to Tuesday.  It’s not a matter of getting used to. I had been using this app faithfully for years.  Now I have to shop for a new weather app that has the functionality of the previous version.  Epic fail!"
1971,Almitaph,"September 12, 2018",1,"Not feeling this new version at all I don’t care that you all have Watson! I’m a simple person.... all I want is a chart that has the temperatures for the next few days. The charts with a column for the high and a column for the low are misleading and not practical. If we’re talking about the same day... both the high and low should be in the same column! And on top of all of that, the app has the nerve to keep crashing. "
1972,redragonfly09,"September 15, 2018",3,"Not fan of updates I use this app throughout the day/daily! They updated it, and I know being a creature of habit I don’t appreciate these changes. I’m not happy with the navigation, layouts, etc. because i don’t like the way it scrolls down by swiping up, if I don’t just select the bottom navigation. It’s not smooth, and often takes longer to get what wanted. I was generous at 3stars, because I still use it. Navigation is terrible!"
1973,Grouchy&Fluffy,"September 17, 2018",3,"Bright White Light What was it you told another reviewer who also complained about the back ground - that in order to give us more info and make it work faster, that meant removing the background images? So?! Just be/c you removed the images why did that necessitate making everything so glaringly white?! It’s painful on the eyes! If we can’t get the background images back at least give us the option of a dark mode."
1974,katrinkump,"September 21, 2018",4,Latest design not user intuitive I don’t like the new look of the Iphone app. I tried to get used to it but it’s really confusing. The old one was easy to navigate and with plenty of information. For example I miss the allergy info or maybe it is hidden somewhere in the new app but anyway I don’t see it any more. At this point I give up and am switching to another app.
1975,deejaynjo,"September 22, 2018",2,"Need a magnifying glass This is the first review I’ve ever written and felt the need to do so now. I’ve always loved TWC app. It had beautiful dynamic backgrounds and was easy for me to navigate and see things at a glance. This most recent “upgrade” is visibly horrible. It’s pretty much white with very small fonts and subtle lines/colors to separate info. This makes it very difficult to just tap the app and instantly see what’s happening this week. I’d love to at least see the ease of use to return, if not the previous version."
1976,BuffBears,"October 10, 2018",1,Radar is lacking. This app was great before the update. Now the app has a bad look and many features from the radar app was removed. The radar use to be able to show warnings and also strong storm tracks. Those were the main feature I used for the app. I now have to use a separate app just to see where exactly a tornado warning is. Please update the radar. Also it is hard to navigate to the hourly and the weekly forecast. You can only access them on the navigation bar and not when you scroll down.
1977,drewperry,"October 15, 2018",3,"Good redesign - Weather Alerts Don’t Work On an iPhone X with iOS 12, the real-time weather alerts don’t work.

If I enable them via settings under favorite locations, the toggle will switch over and I can select the type of alert - but the settings do not save or activate. Go out of this pane and come back in, they have all reverted to disabled."
1978,MommytoMs,"October 31, 2018",1,"HATE the new app I have used The Weather Channel app for years and the new version is awful!  It was such a drastic change from previous versions, I thought I just needed time to get used to it but time has not helped!  It is confusing to navigate.  The small line with the white background is hard to read.  Fortunately I have a really old version on my iPad that I can still use.  Wish I could go back to the old version on my iPhone too.  Please, please, please change it back or start over.  For a weather app, simple is better!!!"
1979,timtom27,"November 17, 2018",5,"I like this one The old version was good but a bit of a pain to use. This one is very good. Much better user interface.

1980,agontop,"June 18, 2018",2,"Inaccurate The most inaccurate app for weather i’ve ever used. I wake up this morning and check the forecast for rain to use as a guide if I should take my motorcycle out, and no rain in the forecast until later in the week. So what happens when I get out of work the very same day, yup rain. Lots of rain!! I guess the storm took an unforeseeable turn that the over paid forecasters never saw coming. This is probably the 7 or 8th time in the last few months this has happened"
1981,Ekylie,"July 7, 2018",4,"Good but I have a suggestion I like that I can alerts for when it’s about to rain where I am, and where lightening has struck near my location. Perfect for when I am on a run or planning to go outside."

The map will show storms, but then when you click on it, everything goes away - like the storms won’t load on top of the map. I’ve had the app for over a year, on an iPhone X with good WiFi/cellular connection. It’s not my phone or the internet - the radar on this app is just not good. I’m deleting and will find something else."

Local news broadcast more in a specific area as where The Weather Channel pinpoints my exact location. 5 star rating from me. Thank you!"
1984,Starlight_7,"August 30, 2018",1,Horrible update The app was just fine how it was. This new update is confusing and hard to find things. You took away helpful things like the UV index and made it hard to navigate and find the info that I need to know quickly. I hate the graphs and want to just be able to quickly glance at an easy to read list of the daily forecast for the next 2 weeks and easy to read hourly list. Very disappointed...if this doesn’t get simplified soon I will be switching weather apps. I’ve stuck with TWC for 7+ years and I’m about done.
1985,xKINGxOFxICEx,"August 30, 2018",1,"Redesign not an improvement I think this new look is terrible. Information fades into the light-colored background instead of standing out as it used to do. It is more complicated to view all the information at-a-glance than it was with the old layout; it takes longer to read and interpret in a line graph than it did in a table or list format. As a final negative, the ads seem to be placed in the way when trying to see information much more so than previously. I will be looking for a weather app from one of the local stations."
1986,Jessebug's iPoop,"September 1, 2018",1,"Update fail Until now, now being this newest update, I have loved the weather channel app. Check it all the time, and very first thing I check on my phone in the morning. However, now it’s crap. The update gives a bright white background, things are all placed in random places. Where’s my 15 day forecast??? I don’t want to look at graphs, are u kidding me?? Like why?!? Now it’s like looking at an excel/power point presentation done by a graph happy intern. I hope this app goes back to awesome, cause now it’s crap and useless to me. Seriously about to delete, and that is sad."

1988,bvilleshan,"September 8, 2018",3,Bring back old view The new home page view is very hard to read and navigate. The old view with just a grid day by day was so much easier to understand and take a quick glance.  This new version you have to change to daily view then click and then read- please go back to the old version where all I had to do was scroll down a bit and see the week very clearly and simplified
1989,Alexis4514,"September 8, 2018",1,Terrible update- bring back the old! Your update makes it very difficult to just see at a glance what the day’s weather is going to be. We don’t need the wavy lines.. just reading the numbers will tell us if the temps are going up or down. Also people who are color blind cant use it at all. Also the days just run into each other.. highs and lows from one day to the next are barely distinguishable. I have to say there isnt a single thing about the update that improves your app. 😔. Bring back the old. Will switch to another app until then.
1990,BManWeeds,"January 24, 2018",4,"Good solid app I use the Weather Channel app all the time. It is easy to navigate and it has all of the key features needed. I like the option to select different locations and save those as favorites. Every once in a while it is unstable, but that has improved recently. One thing I don’t like is all of the advertisements that get in the way. Overall it is a great app."
1991,Instructorbo,"January 25, 2018",5,"All I need A quick check at night and first thing when I get up, the Weatherchannel app gives me all I need.

Good one minute videos give forecasts and interesting weather related topics. Weather alerts for snow, t-storms and flooding.  Love it!"

1995,Drewstello,"April 16, 2018",1,"Just annoyed The clickbait style videos make it impossible to tell wether something is actually important or if the title was purposely misleading to get an ad view. For an app that so many people are supposed to be able to look to for important information and immediate updates, I just feel like it doesn’t quite deliver. The App has been almost completely useless to me in any REAL situations like Harvey (being a Houstonian) where I was totally left in the dark to the risk factor of my area. To quote an amateur food reviewer “my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined”."
1996,Aperturienne,"May 15, 2018",2,"Complicated does not equal better There are more bells and whistles, with a radar type graphic for your current location on the front page, but really no additional information.  Actually there is less - the humidity has been removed from the hourly forecast.  Booo!  Also, no easily accessible list of recently checked locations on the bottom right.  I’m guessing it might offer something like that if you sign up or buy and give them your email. Again, booo!"
1997,flowerchildforever,"May 27, 2018",1,The Weather App This use to be an excellent weather app.   It was easy to get weather info without having to scroll forever.    It was a simple app with good info.   A 15 day forecast is ridiculous.   The weather changes way too often within 15 days.   All that is needed is 10 days and 10 days without having to scroll forever.

I am actually doing without a weather app for the time being with hopes that you will wise up and recreate the format that we want rather than what tickles your fancy. What pleases you is irrelevant, we are the viewers and you must do what we want or what’s the point. What have you to say to that?"

And the layout is much less intuitive in this version.  Also, it’s not as easy to see daily and hourly on main screen.    Overall it just feels much more clumsy than older versions and the constant sale push is just annoying.  I’ll be switching back to the Weather app from Apple if it doesn’t improve on these points."
2008,CowgirlKate21,"December 29, 2019",3,Premium snowfall feature I used to rely on the future 48 hour snowfall to get an idea of how a snow storm was going to hit where I live in MINNESOTA! With the last update I can see that it is now a premium feature which ridiculous for an area that gets lots of snow every winter. I used to love the app but I’m not paying $10 a year just to see how a storm is going to hit us. Would have been a 5 star except for that premium snow forecast.
2009,Jake N5,"December 1, 2019",3,"Great overall, but aggressive in promoting Premium As a weather product, this app provides very reliable weather forecasts, hourly updates, and very useful apps.

I think this app does the job as far as telling me what temp and a very basic forecast, but they recently redesigned the whole thing, making it more difficult (in my not-so-humble opinion) to navigate. In  addition, they removed the barometric pressure readings, which was why I chose this app in the first place. It’s entirely possible that it is still buried in the app somewhere (again, the re-design is awkward), but I can’t find it. Sad."

ML is the new kid on the block and I appreciate the effort but everything is very confusing on the new UI. It’s not clear if we should scroll, tap, click.. and more importantly the main weather section fades away with the amount of videos and information right below it. I don’t know if you guys A/B tested it but you should as I’m sure the variant would loose. Please make the weather the most important thing in the app once again."

The current app is good if you have time and the desired to look around for the info you need to plan your day or week. I wish they had kept the simplicity and brevity of the last version.

Scrolling down to the end finds an option to get rid of ads for a year for &3.99.  No way just to get a clean app. Greedy suns or britches. Ads on former site weren’t so bad, but the smelly of camel pushed all the way into the tent and keerappeted all over everything.

Don’t like the graph AT ALL.  Doesn’t make sense. Too many ads.  Shouldn’t have to watch the SAME 15 second commercial for EVERY video. I am looking for a different weather app as I text.

2078,JakeMichaels,"July 18, 2019",4,"Great app but no alerts? I love using this app and it is very reliable when it comes to the weather forecast, but I’m unable to set any of the alerts no matter how hard I try. I contacted support for it a few weeks ago and still am waiting for an answer. Just don’t see why this is a feature of the app if it’s not even usable. Other than that it’s a great app."
2079,TMon4,"June 19, 2019",2,"New is NOT Better The older version was much better in terms of viewing the daily, hourly, and weekly weather. In the radar map, you could also hit the arrows to see what the future radar weather held in store.  Overall, the display isn’t as friendly, nor visually inviting as the previous app There’s simply too much and my favorite weather app for over 10+ years has really disappointed with the latest version Please go back to the older version!!!"
2080,blueyedwoolf,"September 16, 2018",1,"New update is a huge step back I’m a 30 yr old tech savvy user who is finding it near impossible to navigate this new update. I checked my phone to make sure I was using the right app bc the layout is so confusing and convoluted. None of the flow makes sense, there isn’t an easy to read home page, and I fumble around for way to long trying to find simple things. I definitely will be deleting and finding a different, better laid out/easy to use weather app. Should WC decide to go back to the old format I’ll re-download bc it was great."
2081,Tab Chetski,"September 18, 2018",5,Had to Quit I’ve had to stop using this app because the battery drain is too great. Just looking up the temp and forecast will eat up 4-5% of my battery. If I look at the radar for past and future movement I can easily use up 10-15%. I had to find a new app. Let us know when you fix this.
2082,ArrowMasterGaming,"September 26, 2018",2,"Liked Previous Version Better! I liked this app much more before it was recently updated.  I liked the larger font/readability of the previous version, and the way in which the information was presented.  The font is now too small and too light to see at a quick glance.  I also liked being able to see the current weather conditions clearly on the home screen when app is first opened.  Please, Weather Channel, send us another update!"
2083,jendow,"October 1, 2018",3,"Notifications management When a notification gets banged to the icon, or a story link gets sent to the notifications drop-down, clicking on either of those should take you right to the story. Instead it opens the home page and you have to try to navigate to the item. And they make you try hard... it’s very cluttered and confusing. "
2084,NikkieLynn,"November 3, 2018",1,"Horrible new format I’ve tried to get used to the new format and I just can’t. I need to open a weather app and immediately see what the temp is and what’s coming. The tiny font on the white background looks like regular text to me. Every screen looks the same. The forecast involves non-stop scrolling. I’ve switched to Weatherbug. Where I open the app and everything is right there. The bonus with Weatherbug... I can’t customize my landing page. Weather Channel, I used to love ya but you’ve made getting the weather a frustrating experience. See ya."
2085,DonTheDude,"November 5, 2018",2,Going the wrong direction This app has been steadily going in the wrong direction when it comes to design. In the current version days are shown vertically on my iPad. It is hard to get a picture of the week ahead.
2086,egatts,"December 11, 2018",1,"Update is awful deleted the whole app today! I just want the weather. I don’t want to figure out a weather map! I’ve tried adjusting it several times and it just reverts right back. Tired of trying to just open it and all these ads pop up and I have to pay again to upgrade! No thanks! I’m supposed to have weather max that’s what I paid for. Apparently not. Used to love this app, this and my morning coffee. Not anymore. Sorry weather channel I’m not paying for no ads again. It’s not the money, just a bit disappointing."

Every time an update came out I would attempt to remove ads again, but app would crash. But after a few months the programmers finally fixed that issue. Thanks!"
2088,Rezod21,"March 30, 2019",1,App going downhill I agree with others. This app is getting worse and worse every release. I used to be able to pop it open real quick and get what I need. Now it’s a 5 minute adventure between the long loading screen and trying to get past some dumb videos or ads. Then hard to find simple information that used to be readily available. You don’t need to change a good thing just for the sake of change. For the sake of change on my side I’m going to use a different app that gives me what I need.... Weather!!
2089,Gopappa,"May 4, 2019",5,I’ve been watching it for years. I use others as well for different reasons. This one I use for accuracy on precipitation and temperature. It’s best for that but not wind speed or direction. I also like the videos but they’re not as easy to watch now for some reason. Overall good application though.
2090,Iconoclasticcc,"September 1, 2018",1,"Don’t fix what isn’t broken!! You know, once upon a time this was a beautiful app. It was so beautiful, so simple, that they had FREE MARKETING from people screenshotting the beautiful design and posting to social media. Then they changed the app and while it remained functional, it was cluttered with ads with no way to escape them. Then they updated again and now the app is so cluttered it’s nearly unusable. I don’t want ads. I’m willing to pay to not have ads. But then... why would I, when the design is no longer nice to look at? Going to be deleting this app sadly."
2091,Ackemp01,"September 1, 2018",2,"I don’t like the 2018 redesign The last time you redesigned your app, I rated it three stars. This time (Aug 2018), it’s going down to two stars. Whoever you paid to design the new version should give you the money back. When I open a weather app, the first thing I want to see is ... the weather!  Show me the radar and the temperature and I’ll be happy. I don’t want to see a line graph at 6 a.m.! My wife says she’s deleting the app from her phone. I’ll keep it for now, but I will be looking for an alternative."
2092,KVP1024,"September 1, 2018",2,"Why “fix” something that wasn’t broken? I’m very disappointed in the changes. No value added but value definitely removed!  I’m 68; I can barely read the new info layout. If this is someone e’s idea of what’s useful, fire them. It was much easier to use as it was and much more useful.  And now the ads are even worse/more annoying with placement.  Come on, Weather Channel, you’re better than this.  I’ll have to look for a different app after relying on yours for years."
2093,bonnieg27,"September 3, 2018",1,"Horrible horrible horrible!!! Please bring back the old version this new one is god awful!!! I am looking for a new weather app right now. The old blue background and old format were so much easier to jump in and check weather in a hurry. Now you got this awful graph with white clouds on a white background i have to sit and figure out what the heck I’m looking at on this stupid graph, no more quick look and go. Who is the genius that decided this graph was user friendly???? Can’t stand this new app. Every update you make gets worse not better!!!"
2094,BeachPanda,"September 7, 2018",2,"New layout is terrible The new layout is terrible. I liked the old one. The information I wanted was easy to find and I could see it at a glance. Now I have to scroll through a bunch of stuff I don’t care about, and when I do find what I’m looking for, I still have to scroll instead of being able to see if at a glance. The weekly forecast is the best example. I have to scroll through each day instead of having it clearly in line. Please go back to the old format."
2095,MLP225,"September 7, 2018",1,"Update is beyond terrible I don’t write reviews. Ever. I liked the 15 day forecast. I would’ve liked it more if it was accurate. I like the layout. I would’ve liked it more if the hourly forecast was accurate. But I tolerated the inaccuracies ... until the most recent update. It’s terrible, very bad, no good.... just what are y’all thinking? The new layout is useless, and now the inaccuracies (when I can find the information I’m looking for) are intolerable. Go back to the old layout, and this time instead of reinventing (and flattening) the wheel, just make it work."
2096,Jwaek,"September 8, 2018",2,"Disappointed Very disappointing update. When I open a weather app, the 1st thing I should see is today’s high/low and chance of rain. With the new update, I don’t get this. It’s there, but I have to hunt for it. I usually look at the weather first thing when I am not fully awake yet. I don’t want to hunt for basic info like how hot is going to be today."
2097,3littl3birds,"September 9, 2018",1,"Need more contrast and daily hi/low first I don’t usually write reviews, but the updated Weather app actually hurts my eyes. It’s too bright with not enough contrast. The darker background with white text was easier to read. And now Users have to tap another button to get the daily high/low. The new layout of the high/low is more difficult to comprehend too since they are side by side in table format with the day spanning 2 columns. It was much easier to understand quickly at a glance when it was in a “high/low” format. Really wishing I hadn’t upgraded the app. :("
2098,JakeIsDisappointed,"September 12, 2018",2,"Update fail The previous version of this app was easy to use and quick to see info at a glance. This latest update makes you scroll up down and side to side, as well as flip through multiple panels to try and find the info you want. It would be better if you could switch panels are on/off, or at least let us modify what order they appear. This used to be a 5-star app for me because it was sleek and easy to use, but now it’s annoying and cumbersome."
2099,Alinha89,"September 15, 2018",1,"Won’t Load & When Does: Confusing This app just spins when I need it to load, most of the time I have to use the 3D Touch shortcut to get it to open at all. Once it is open, the current information is small (couldn’t find it when I first updated). This app to me is very confusing (for a techy person) compared to the old version. I personally preferred the old version and would like to see most of that added into this one. The old version was working great, if it isn’t broken...don’t fix it! This one is broken...fix it pls!!"

2104,SrChap,"August 23, 2018",1,"Remove Ads option not working on ver. 9.12 The option to remove ads from the Weather Channel app ver 9.12 for iPhone did not work for me. I was charged $3.99, and the charge was confirmed by the advertisements are still on the app. I clicked to remove ads a second time and was charged a second time and the ads continued. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app but the ads are still there. Luckily, Apple is reimbursing me for the charges. The Weather Channel has not responded after I sent emails for support. Very disappointing product and service."
2105,MarkS Lansing,"August 27, 2018",5,Outstanding application This latest version of the weather Channel application is pretty awesome. There is a lot more to learn as they help move things around a bit but I think in general it’s much improved. It’s very complete two it seems. Thank you weather channel for doing such a great job.
2106,PurpleDirewolf2015,"August 29, 2018",2,"Please bring back the old version!! I can honestly say that I really don’t like this new look. It’s confusing and I don’t like how I have to click on different tabs to see everything that was once all on the same screen. It take the simplicity that I loved about this app and threw it out the window. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because I lived what this app used to be. Please return to the old look, it’s much better than whatever you just gave us."
2107,SnADad,"August 31, 2018",1,"No replacement for the original This app is a rollercoaster ride from ... The new version has the squiggly sine curve display for the weeks highs and lows. It is not just awful but it spreads the information out over more of your phone. That means a lot more scrolling since they now use 2.5x the space to display the same data. Finding information is harder than ever. Don’t take this the wrong way but the interface was designed to please a 14 year old girl. And believe me, they don’t care about the weather  "
2108,Carmenghia,"August 31, 2018",1,"Where is week ahead at a glance??? I do not like the new design of the weather app. In the old app I liked looking at the week ahead. In one screen you could see several days at a time by reading across, you could see the daily highs lows and rain chances, then you tapped an arrow on the right and you could see the following week. I don’t like this new one where I have to scroll up and I have to hunt for the high temperature low temperature and the rain probability. Please bring back the old week at a glance. If it’s still here tell me how to find it."

As another reviewer mentioned you can have a list of different locations around the country and see the weather there quickly. That is the main reason that this is my top weather app!! I don't really have any complaints. Once you get used to the navigation, it's a very useful app."
2112,jamesdrowe,"May 13, 2018",2,"Ads are annoying, app is slow I used this app for a very long time but now I am moving on. The ads are very annoying and they slow down the loading time of the weather. I tried to report some inappropriate ads as well but they never disappeared. I’m not willing to pay to get rid of the ads so that’s not an option. Fix the ads so they are less annoying and less inappropriate, speed up the load time, and then maybe I’ll download it again."

I have decided to delete it from my mobile device. Despite my telling it which alerts I want and which I do not, it continuously resets itself and alerts me to impending drizzle. I don’t want to know about drizzle. I will give WeatherBug an exclusive shot at the title. Fix the useless alerts. Stop resetting preferences. Our mobile devices already demand too much of our attention."
2114,Lanist,"March 27, 2020",1,"Used to be good When this was a more simple app, it was great! I’m not sure why the developers have decided to try to turn it into an actual channel full of constant news updates, ads, and complicated formats. I loved the original app, and with every update it becomes more cluttered and things stop working right. I can’t even open the radar anymore. Just because you CAN add a feature doesn’t mean you SHOULD. You definitely aren’t going to make me upgrade to a premium version when your free version does nothing right."
2115,michaelharrigan,"March 15, 2020",1,"Going Downhill The Weather Channel App is going downhill and it’s very disappointing. You should be ashamed of yourselves for charging for a premium service especially with the radar! Can the premium layers help save people’s lives especially during tornado season? The answer is yes, so you are actually not trying to help save lives but are doing the opposite. Why charge for these premium layers when you already are making money from all of the advertising and now new pop up advertising (which is really annoying)? I am very disappointed!"
2116,youngjeff48,"February 24, 2020",1,"This was my go to weather app before all the ads This was one of the first apps I downloaded back with my first iPhone - so much more detail than the apple weather app. At first they had really great content, with just some sprinkled in ads, but now there are more ads than content. Finally I’ve had enough. Trying to view daily weather and it would “jump” around causing me to inadvertently click an ad vs the content I was trying to access. I finally paid for another app to get rid of this and the overwhelming ads."
2117,Bosco Dumpling,"February 6, 2020",1,"2020 Update Ruined It This was my go-to weather app... until the 2020 update completely ruined it. The format went from easy and convenient to annoying and aggravating. On top of that, the whole thing is now oriented toward encouraging the user to upgrade to ""premium"" by paying a fee. It hits you with withheld information at every turn. The funny thing is... I actually would pay, just to have the app go back to its previous form. But, I wouldn't pay one penny to have an enhanced version of this horrible new format. Goodbye Weather Channel."

It doesn’t work well at all, takes forever to load, it is full...I mean full of ads, and they are not short ads either.  After they finish, the information you went after originally never comes up.  And if it does, it is either choppy, or the audio plays and the video doesn’t.  Come on Weather Channel...you are better than that."
2119,Helen 60,"January 25, 2020",2,Allow multiple cities The old app allowed you to add different cities. I was able to swipe and view the current weather for multiple places I was going to travel to. I was able to track the weather in Orlando before I had to pack for my trip. I live just a couple of hours from the Jersey shore and the weather is always different there. I used to check the weather to see if it was a good day to hit the beach. Is there something I am missing?

I’ve paid for other weather apps and I don’t want to pay for another one—having to be asked if I want premium every time I open the app may seem like a small thing but for me ruins the experience. "

Because I wanted to eliminate the ads and get extended forecasts I paid to upgrade to premium service. It worked for a short time and then reverted to the old service with ads and no extended service. Like an idiot, I repurchased the premium service and the same thing happened. I tried and tried to contact them. No response. I HOPE THIS GETS THEIR ATTENTION!!!  However, after seeing all these negative reviews recently I doubt it. I hope Apple moves in and corrects this situation."

Also, the radar no longer has time on it so for example  it shows rain moving in but you don’t know what time.  The app crashes or frequently needs to be closed out and restarted.  So many other free app choices, this one is not worth it anymore.  Bye bye weather channel app unless you make some major changes!"

Unfortunately, TWC’s support of Apple’s native iPhone and Watch app has been inconsistent and demonstrably lacking (at least in the central Florida region).  Not sure who is dropping the ball here but if there’s a partnership between TWC and Apple in pushing weather info to Apple’s native phone and watch apps, both can share the blame."

It can takes 30 seconds for the app to open at times. It may sound like I’m nitpicking but if you just want to check the temp quickly you don’t want to be waiting for the app. I have also found that the app seems to be showing more and more ads encouraging me to purchases the $0.99/Month subscription.

Obviously there will be a margin of error- it’s weather and also it will keep getting less accurate with the effects of global warming. But what is going on with them? Wait, I shouldn’t be surprised considering that their tv channel turned into dumbed down entertainment a long long time ago. Oh well. I’ve downloaded a few weather apps and I’m comparing them daily. Hopefully one will stand out."

Closing the app and reopening doesn’t help. Rebooting the phone doesn’t help. Only way to get it to open is to completely delete the app and reinstall. After having to do that about every other day I have to say I am sick of the program and it’s ridiculous issues. Anyway, I’ve deleted it yet again and find another weather app that actually works."

Every update says it’s supposed to fix bugs and crashes but I honestly have never seen a difference.

The issue is confirmed as being with the Weather Channel app because none of my other apps have this issue. "
2143,coljmthomas,"September 26, 2018",1,"New Version is terrible I have used this app for years. A week ago a new version was released that is terrible and makes the app entirely unusable. The previous version of the app had for the forecast white letters/digits on a dark background. The latest version for the forecast has small light letters/digits on a white background. Because of the white background it is very difficult to read the letters/digits of the forecast, particularly outside in sunlight. The newest version makes the app unusable and so I have downloaded another weather app to use."
2144,inobuyfromyourads,"October 15, 2018",1,Success I never want to buy from your advertisers! I used to love to watch your little short videos! But you put an 12sec+ long add in front of every single one which actually takes at least 12+ secs to load then the actual video takes another 12+ secs - you want to make me never buy a product from anyone who advertises with you. Your advertising has succeeded!
2145,OldGuy300,"October 19, 2018",1,"Horrible new interface I have used this weather application for years. Tried many, even paid weather apps, but always came back to this weather application. The new interface does not provide easy access to see current weather, future weather. The interface is convoluted and confusing.  Seems to for displaying more Ads and videos no one wants to watch. Stay away from this app until they listen to customers and change the interface to something useful."
2146,219kw,"October 27, 2018",2,"The new update I bought a new phone a couple of months ago add downloaded the weather channel app. It ended up being a newer version than what I was used to. It makes looking up the weather more difficult. The old version is so much better. I recently got another phone, and backed up my phone from a later date so that I had the old weather channel. I’m so much happier with it. I would give the new version 2 stars and the OLD version 5 stars."
2147,sunny & stormy,"October 31, 2018",1,"Do not upgrade this latest version I live for the weather channel (because of work) - on TV and my phone app, but this latest upgrade is horrible! They’ve taken away all the color / graphics on the daily viewing screens, laid out previous information in a whole new format and I cannot find the connection to see what the weather is in other cities where my family live. Everything is so bland now. This version is the worst upgrade ever. Do not go for it! I wish I could go back to previous version."
2148,Cookermom,"November 11, 2018",1,"Go back to the previous design!!! I am so disappointed with the update to this app! Visually, it is nowhere near as easy to follow as the old version. With the older one, I could open my app and quickly go to whichever weather prediction I wanted and see it clearly. This is so much harder to discern and to find my way around on. Plus, it takes forever to load! Frequently when I open it, I am met with a blank white screen that never goes anywhere else. Why did you change what was working so well? I’m it’s not broke, don’t “fix” it!"

2150,Travelheaven,"August 30, 2018",1,"Still Can’t Swipe Between Locations I was so excited when I saw that the app had been re-designed, I thought “Maybe they put back in the swipe left to see different locations feature that used to be included” But no. The app still has a ridiculous and cumbersome way to check different city locations; the type face is smaller and lighter weight than ever before, the visual contrast is poor, and overall the content is very hard to read — everything is smaller. I am very disappointed by this “upgrade.”"
2151,ItsKatyLynn,"September 1, 2018",5,new update... I LOVE the new interface. so much more sleek and a lot less clunky than the old one. however the UV index is gone! I spend a lot of time outside and relied on that scoring to know when I should stay inside. Please bring it back!!! This is my favorite weather app and I’d hate to have to download another app just for the UV index.
2152,ImMotherSuperior,"September 2, 2018",1,What was great is now garbage This app was wonderful it was great it was nothing wrong with it apparently they got some bean counter to come in and screw it up. It is ridiculous to navigate. Just want to quick look at weather conditions like what time will it rain if I have a flight to catch at least an approximate time. Now it takes 10 seconds to 20 seconds to load that’s too slow how are use another app and delete this one. What was once golden is now garbage. “If something aint broke don’t fix it.”Goodbye weather channel what garbage.
2153,DaniRam,"September 10, 2018",2,New update isn’t as user friendly I’ve used this app for years. My #1 go-to weather app.  After the latest update I’m thinking of deleting it.  Does it work?  Yes.  Does it have lots of details?  Yup.  Is it as easy to get your info and navigate as before the latest update?  Nope.  In an effort to update and make it seem higher tech or something they made it harder to navigate. I don’t like the layout and the design changes.  After I’m done typing this review I’m on the hunt for a new weather app.
2154,The101,"September 10, 2018",1,"Too much going on The latest update is confusing hard to navigate and has too many pages to swipe on and off. If I accidentally swipe instead of select then the weather page I was on is gone and I’m looking at something totally different. I can’t tell what the temp is, can’t find the weekend forecast, is is raining. Is that my radar or a featured story?? "
2155,Puzzlermonkey,"September 11, 2018",2,"New update is terrible The new UI for the app is a significant step back. I used to be able to open it up and quickly see at a glance what the high and low temp was for the day (without digging through prose) and there's used to be an easy symbol for cloudy, rainy, snowy, sunny. Also, on the forecasts by day section, the high and low temps are in separate columns, which makes them look like separate days. Why not just put the high temp above the line and the low temp below? It would be much more intuitive."
2156,Jree26,"September 14, 2018",1,"Recent upgrade is a flop After the recent upgrade I am now searching for a new weather app. As the old saying goes, “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.” Clearly weather channel should have taken that advice. I have used the Weather Channel app for years but I will no longer be using it. The new layout is awful and visually distracting. Unnecessary Line graphs, lots of horizontal scrolling, and having to search for information that was instantly visually accessible on the old version make this upgrade a major flop. Very disappointed."
2157,ldino,"September 16, 2018",1,"I hate the new version The old version was so much easier to read and navigate.  This version is horrible!  It is difficult to navigate through to find information needed, to figure out which day and time the weather information refers to, and to be able to see a week at a time.  Having the weather to scroll through horizontally as opposed to vertically is confusing and I can’t find features I enjoyed looking at (weather related video clips).  I wish I could default back to the last version!"
2158,RScarr,"September 17, 2018",3,"Where are the Low & High pressure centers of circulation? Suddenly, it appears, none of the weather apps are able to figure out where the Low & High Pressure centers of circulation are.  They are also incapable of showing cold fronts and warm fronts on there maps!  The Weather Underground app did this but since the Weather Channel took over the app that features disappeared.  A lot of us understood what this information meant and used it all the time."
2159,Ling410,"September 17, 2018",1,"Absolutely Horrible The radar is always inaccurate and every time it says it’s going to rain it never does. The old version was way better but now you have to watch the same ads over and over just to watch their click bait videos. I don’t need an app to tell me it’s a good time to go for a jog. I don’t care about the air quality because regardless I’m going to be forced to breath it. Seriously I trust the Weather app that’s pre-downloaded on your iPhone more than I trust The Weather Channel app. Download Weather-Bug and call it a day, Trust me."

2162,Andalgia,"May 24, 2018",5,"New update broke my app I’ve always loved using this app. It keeps me up to date. However, yesterday I updated this app and now it won’t open past the original loading screen which is unfortunate and leaves this app useless for me until an update is released that fixes this issue."
2163,bk randy55,"May 24, 2018",2,"The weather The past month has been out right ridiculous, due to crazy weather, and terrible forecasting. I just want accurate weather predictions. However when The Weather Channel do put out predictions for weather, the forecast is totally and completely off.  Are you guys just want us to buy your apps that cost money or is it just incompetents. I agree you can’t always predict the weather, but for Pete sakes at least have it close to that days forecast."
2164,Salem Enchanted,"May 26, 2018",2,"Disappointed, I liked old version much more.. I enjoyed checking the weather throughout the day with the old app. This upgrade is awful. It cuts out on radar, stops when switching to new screen. The maps are a real issue for me. Old app you could get great pic right away zooming in or out. Not this one. When I asked about this I was told reduce font. I am not going to do that every time I want to see radar. I added another app. Go back to old app WeatherChannel. I lost $4.00 on no ad."
2165,Kate5501,"June 21, 2018",2,"Just ok I like the fact that I can look at various cities’ weather at the same time, however not super happy I can’t just swipe left or right to see those cities. This is the only reason i keep this app. Also, REALLY dislike that I have shut off notifications multiple times, yet they somehow always get turned back on and I get random weather updates of non-important things, like when the rain is going to start. If this continues, I’m deleting the app."
2166,Beebeebee19,"July 17, 2018",1,"Slow and bloated with garbage This was my go-to weather app for years for accurate weather forecasting.  The last few updates have made it slower and slower. I’m running a brand new IPhone 6 with loads of free GBs and the most current operating system and this app takes about 30 sec + to open. It should open instantly but they keep bloating this app up with videos, ads, news, etc. Its beyond distracting and I don’t want to wake up every morning to seeing the most current world weather destruction first thing. Bye bye... I’m moving on."
2167,jah*1,"August 11, 2018",1,"Updates Continue to Disappoint I have been using the free version of this app for quite awhile. Each update continues to disappoint this user. Understanding TWC is going to put ads in on the app and videos to pay for the platform, the app performance continues to get worse.

2168,Kallyn & Nonna,"August 30, 2018",1,Beyond Terrible Going to  YAHOO WEATHER I updated to the app with the new look. It’s terrible. Hard to find information? Miss the 15 day prediction  where you could see a whole week at once. You just have to keep sliding and sliding.  Your app asked for feedback while I was getting ready for work so I tapped send feedback. I needed to check the weather first though and after I did this feedback email was gone. HOW CAN I GO BACK TO THE OLD ONE? I HATE THIS APP. I’ll JUST GET A DIFFERENT ONE.
2169,keepcalmandfitblron,"August 30, 2018",1,"New interface is awful There is way too much going on with the new update, makes checking the weather too confusing. And while I’m here get those videos that auto play off the main screen! It stops anything I already had playing on my phone and if I wanted to watch them I would click on them. And now we have random advertisements on the main screen too? You’re THE weather channel, you shouldn’t need to be getting revenue from ads and your users don’t want to see them. It looks really tacky."
2170,Kilium,"February 25, 2018",1,"Keeps crashing- GARBAGE! I’ve had this app since the beginning of time. I’ve loved it! However, since the last update, every time I open it, it crashes. Won’t even open. I tried restarting my phone, I delete the app and reinstall. Once I reinstall - it works for a second, but if i put my phone on standbye and attempt to open the app again, it just crashes. Only way to get it to work is to uninstall and reinstall. It works for one time, and that’s it. Garbage. Let me know when it’s fixed and I might, MIGHT, consider changing my review."
2171,Photomaster1414,"April 2, 2020",2,"Used to be so good... This was my go to weather app, and still is, but now there are suddenly all these horrible, clickbait ads. Every time you go from one page of the app to another page, there are these full screen ads, and in top of that, there are banner ads, and ads between the days in the forecast. And they aren’t good ads, they are the fake ones with pictures of nasty food and “eat this every day to cure Alzheimer’s” and stuff like that. Absolutely horrible."
2172,Paul84735,"March 8, 2020",3,"No integrity in notification settings App works well. Forecasts are frequently wrong but so are most meteorologists. Propaganda is tedious. But the most annoying thing is that they don’t follow the notification settings. I have allowed notifications for severe weather only. They also send promotional notifications like “Taste of Spring”. The more they annoy me with unauthorized notifications, the closer I am to deleting and finding another weather app."

I was still able to get the old type of format until a few months ago. I liked the old one because it was easy to see and so simple to use. I’m stuck with the new one now and it’s worthless because the temperature won’t update-I just looked@ it and it’s still on yesterday’s weather! Plus, the ads are so distracting and annoying. A piece of junk-I am deleting it!"
2175,DaBearsBitch,"February 9, 2020",1,"Time to delete the app. All the standard options that WERE free, are now “premium“. I’m not paying for something that everyone use to get for free. In my opinion the AccuWeather app is 1000 times better than the Weather Channel app. They have a two hour precipitation gage that tells you when to expect inclement weather and how much. They also tell you from what direction the wind is blowing. Instead of having a steadfast arrow. They use to let you know if it was coming from, say from the NE direction. This new arrow is stationary. It does no one any good."

2177,smrdrm,"January 24, 2020",1,New Version Inferior The new version is definitely inferior to the older one. It removed ALL the features I loved in the older version. No longer can I swipe to see multiple selected locations. The long bar across the screen with large font weather information is gone. Now it’s a small window on one side and the information is difficult to read. You had a great app before this new version. Why change something that works well? Now I’ve switched to another weather app because this new version is so bad.

If you like having to scroll for any free content (like, say the weather), like seeing advertising Everywhere on Every Screen to upgrade to a premium version of the app, and like having simple features removed regularly to “nudge” you to pay for premium, then this app is for you.  This used to be a good app with good weather info (wind speed/direction, good live local radar, etc), but it’s ALL about shoving customers to pay now.  Your nudge for me to pay is getting this bad review, none of my $$, and app deleted.  Bad juju"
2180,T Mcn,"April 21, 2019",1,"Used to be great This used to be a great app. It was totally bulletproof and gave me exactly what I needed. Then, they fixed what wasn’t broken and changed the app entirely with version 10. Since then the app is slow to load, crashes regularly, doesn’t load radar images, and just generally doesn’t work well. It typically takes me one or two force-quits to get it to open correctly (on a recent iPhone X). This was a poorly done change. Hopefully one day this app can be made as good as it was before it was “improved.”"
2181,EDN83,"May 4, 2019",1,"What happened The app is very slow to load, and there is less and less weather information with each new version. For instance, I was looking at the hourly forecast just now, and it’s only showing about 16 hours in advance where it formerly was more than a full day. Please bring back the older version or improve upon this one; otherwise, I will be looking for another weather application. It’s a shame, because you’re the ones Ive always trusted, but the app is useless if I can’t access the information I need."
2182,Jim R.,"May 4, 2019",1,"Bloated app, slow I used to like this app a lot. Lately it seems like it loads ads before the weather. It’s slow and the UI feels slow. At times it struggles to load simple weather data and radar in locations that I have adequate cellular connectivity. Probably consumes too much data for ads. Often times it fails to retrieve the forecast if I leave the app for a time and later try to check the current conditions. Simply put: Weather Channel is a bloated app. I switched to Accuweather and was amazed what I’ve been missing."
2183,Asthma Troubles again,"May 14, 2019",5,Good for people with asthma I love this app. I love the tiny details of how the weather is gonna be and what types of pollen are in the air. I have asthma bad so this is very helpful for my daily life. Hit and humid temperatures give me asthma attack’s and some types of pollen. Having this app to look at daily makes me feel safer knowing what I have to look forward that day.

The start up screen shows you little more than the current temperature and subsequent screens are so cluttered with ads you can hardly find useful info. To make matters worse, pop ups urging you to upgrade to premium are a constant interruption. "

I had no issue with the ads they way they were before but this makes checking the daily weather (which I use for work) take much longer then it should, unfortunately I will likely be looking for a different weather app."
2187,Pizzaman200123,"December 30, 2019",3,Getting worse Was a good app until they started to demand money for some of the features that used to be free. Can no longer few snowfall projections without paying and they took away the times on the radar which kind of takes away a lot of its use if I don’t know what time the precipitation is coming through. Go back a few versions and stop demanding money and it’s fine again.
2188,JPA69,"October 5, 2019",3,"How hard is it to retain favorites The weather features of this app are fine but it is annoying that it constantly loses my favorite locations. I like to get a quick glance of weather in several places for comparison. This app will do that for a while when I mark favorites, but then it clears them and makes me do that setup all over again. I’d rate the app higher if I didn’t want to use that feature."

I would like an easier way to get to the 7 day overview (not the details). Also, why isn’t the radar working any longer?  Seems like a few weeks ago (mid August) it just stopped working and won’t show the current radar.  This needs to be fixed. Will attempt to remove and uninstall (unless I can find a better weather app)"
2190,Lollibita,"November 4, 2018",1,"New Update Fail I am extremely disappointed in the new updated Weather Channel app. The lighting is very harsh even with the dimmest setting with all of the white and little color. I miss the prior 10 day forecast layout that was convenient and colorful. Now there is only a daily forecast that is jumbled together without separation. Also, what is with that graph at the top...I do not find this useful in anyway. I do not mind updates normally, but this is a big fat fail. I will be deleting this weather app that I have loved and depended on for many years."
2191,CRGBIA,"December 10, 2018",1,"Whose Idea Was This? The new version is HORRIBLE! It’s painful to look at and so unnecessarily difficult to glean the actual information you came for. I get it, ads are necessary for a free app, but why do the news pieces have to take up so much space? Can I just have the weather, please? It’s like giving people the forecast was an afterthought versus the sole function of the app. It’s total visual clutter. It’s a shame, as it’s been my trusted weather go-to since I’ve had an iPhone. But this is just so unpleasant to look at/difficult to use, I go elsewhere for weather."

However, after ads are removed and app is closed any attempt to open the app again results in the splash screen with the “spinning wheel” and it never opens.

Repeated emails (the only contact provided) to support have remained unanswered. Don’t purchase the remove ads!"

It’s good to know if rain is coming, if there’s snow or freezing rain on the way.  I can spend those extra hours with my grandkids if I don’t have to leave early.

With this latest update, it won’t let me toggle through my saved locations- I have to search for them every time and there’s no way to display all on one screen or even toggle. It’s a new search every time and very bad from a UX/UI perspective. And now the ads are overwhelming. Deleting and finding a new app."

2207,Getlm00,"September 13, 2018",2,"Not liking updated app I think the person who designed the new version of this app must be very young with excellent eyesight. I am finding it very hard to see the print and visuals on the today/hourly/daily forecasts. The percentages for rain and little clouds above it are too faint gray.

2210,camris,"February 28, 2018",5,"Newest “Update” has rendered app useless This has been my go to weather app forever. However, the app crashes before even opening since the newest “update”. 😢  It has rendered the app useless! Please fix it! 1-star"
2211,Gemini6,"March 31, 2018",2,"Gemini6 My husband & I used this app all the time until recently! It no longer pulls up the township we live in automatically, as our current location. When it asks us if the location it’s showing is our current location and we click on NO, the screen goes blank and takes you out of the app. We are both VERY disappointed and it happened around the time of the last update! We’re discontinuing use of the weather channel app."
2212,scoobydumb,"May 24, 2018",1,Forced into this app Forced into this app. after they discontinued old one. This one is slow to load if it loads at all. The old one was easier to navigate. The old one you could save all your favorite city’s and swipe through them. This one you have to search for the city every time you want to check out a different one. Unless they do some major updates soon to this one I will be finding another app to use. So disappointed. The old app was my go to every time I wanted to check the weather. This one is a joke.
2213,WrXgirl,"June 10, 2018",1,"Went from great to horrible.. I used to be able to save multiple cities and all you had to do was swipe right or left to switch between the different cities that were stored. Now when I swipe left or right, it comes to a page where I have to either search for a city or select from a recent or favorite one. It was so much easier just swiping left or right to go through your saved cities. Now it’s just a hassle. I am deleting this app and am going to use the built in Apple weather app from here on out."
2214,salvadorena84,"June 28, 2018",2,"Liked the app but the ads were horrible I’ve used the apps for years and really liked it. But just this past weeks pop up video ads began to show up and increasingly got more frequent. Today, in just trying to view the next 48 hour period the videos popped up a total of 6 times. I know it’s and it’s don’t mind advertising, but when it’s constant and impedes you from using the app, no thank you. Deleted it today after almost 10 years of use."
2215,AngryKittyCat,"July 9, 2018",4,Too many ads I like the weather channel.  It’s one of two channels I watch.  I don’t like the ads EVERYWHERE.  I refuse to waste my time watching videos on this ap bc there is no way around watching stupid ads.  I refuse to watch them.  I also shouldn’t have to scroll past 4 of them to get to the radar.  I love the app.  It works and it only alerts me if my area is in a polygon BUT ENOUGH D*** ADS

2218,Neveragoodday,"January 23, 2020",1,"Less than one star Keeps changing every time ios updates. Hate this new one. Difficult to compare one day to the next, can’t find precipitation, humidity, everything’s bad, bad, bad. "
2219,xheavenxhelpxusx,"January 11, 2020",1,"This app has become useless! I’ve been using this app nearly every day for several years. I CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I thought if I stuck with the app long enough they’d improve it, but each update is worse. I’m sick of the glitches, sick of the ads, sick of the clickbait videos that give me no information. The endless ads and asking me to go premium have been the final straws."
2220,sheabes,"May 29, 2019",1,Gah this app is so consistently bad! One would think the weather channel could pull off a better app than this. I keep giving it a try over and over again and I’m consistently disappointed. It takes forever to load and update information. It’s constantly glitching and crashing no matter what phone I have used it on. The information is usually inaccurate like saying 0% chance of precipitation when it’s currently raining for a high of 87 but the current temperature is 90. I’m giving up on this app for good!
2221,5FOOTNOTHIN,"June 1, 2019",4,"Latest version rocks!! Really like the latest release. Easy to use, accurate, and lots of features.  I also use it on my Apple Watch as well, but it’s complication option only shows the chance of rain %, not sure why it also wouldn’t show the current temperature. This is the only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars."
2222,bukchazrr,"January 2, 2020",5,The best app When your working in the weather the weather app is above the rest it lets me know when to put my rain gear on or get ready for fog or snow conditions ! The notifications says a brief shower you can count on within 1 minute your about to get rain it so far has always been right!
2223,Winter rr,"January 2, 2020",1,"What is wrong with this app? Since I purchased the premium version of the weather channel, I’ve had 2 problems. I no longer am able to see the hourly weather. The app just turns off.  Also, since I purchased it on my iPad... I’m unable to use the premium version on my iPhone. Thought I had to purchase it again for my phone and the app keeps telling that I already have the premium version when I really don’t. It tried to sell me the premium version for next year. Errr! It’s so frustrating. I want my money back!"
2224,harpoonb34,"December 13, 2019",1,"Disappointed in the Weather Channel I have threatened to delete this app for years. Videos have never loaded correctly, the ads load faster than the actual content that I am trying to view. The radar is useless 90% of the time. But now every single time I open the app, I have to close an ad from TWC asking me to upgrade to their premium app. The free app is garbage, surely you don’t think I will pay you for it. I’m going to find an app that actually has climate information and not climate propaganda. Goodbye weather channel."
2225,SmithM12345678910,"November 16, 2019",1,"Paid for Premium and did not work 6 weeks ago, I paid $9.99 to upgrade to Premium; it is still not working even though I was charged. I have tried to contact the app developers via email, the option listed. I have read their posted articles on their site, and tried to restore the app. None of this has been helpful. When you email them an issue, you get an automatic email stating they will contact you. I have not heard back anything. This has been frustrating to say the least!"
2226,Medic man91,"October 19, 2019",3,"Stop removing features This app was great about 5 updates ago. Every time they update it, they remove features people actually use, then add stuff that is unnecessary. Instead of keeping functions that actually let you look at the weather, you continue adding more space for ads. You’re making it harder and harder to actually see your own weather. Stop changing it."
2227,Carolina Nana25,"September 7, 2019",5,"Alerts I love this app but there is one thing I’m not sure about. When my iPhone has an alert on it and I go to the weather app, I sometimes don’t know what the alert is for. I hope you can clear this up and make it more apparent to where I look for the alert that has been sent. Thank you"
2228,Etxgirl,"August 24, 2019",3,Please Remove Temp flags from Map After last update I have little flags in my radar map over the places I monitor or my current location.  They cover the radar people!  Tell me how to remove them.  I live in tornado alley and need to see accurate images.  I like the rest of your app but have to go to Accu Wearher app to see the radar.  You can remove the flags from their map.  Please fix.  I have emailed and reviewed before.  No response.

2230,Cgd1982,"October 9, 2018",4,"Miss the old app! The hourly info is vague and only covers a few things. I miss the actual “hourly” breakdown which seemed more precise and easy to interpret. Why change a good thing. I like the old app way better. I want the weather in a simple to follow app, not an interactive app in which scans over multiple topics. It feels like Facebook for the weather. Make it simple again, please:("
2231,viola Vee,"October 24, 2018",1,App Redesign The redesign has ruined the weather app. The temperatures are now much harder to see due to the small font on a pale background. Before I could get lots of info on various parts of the forecast without having to click on different places to bring up other screens. It takes forever to load.  Videos often don’t load or cut out for no reason. I can no longer go from the weather in NY to CT and CA by a swipe to the side. I hate the whole redesign. Found out that my friends hate it too.
2232,SamIAm214,"October 24, 2018",1,"Stop fixing what isn't broken! Old App was way better. I hardly use this one anymore, it isn't user friendly. "
2233,hsewell,"November 8, 2018",1,Updates are Terrible This used to be my go-to weather app but since the new changes I will probably be deleting. It used to be so easy on my eyes and the lay out was perfect. Now it’s so bright white and everything runs together. There is less weather information and I find myself just looking at the basic weather app on my phone all the time now because it’s easier. Unfortunately if I don’t see actual improvements soon I will have to delete the app. A month ago I would’ve given this app 5 stars.
2234,fancy bot,"November 26, 2018",4,Last update is not good I only used this weather app until last update and now they have tried to make it pretty and you can’t hardly read it.   I would rather it be
2235,Ed in the BK,"December 16, 2018",1,"A weather app that buries the current temperature?? TWC was once my go-to app for weather. Why? Because it had the most important information I needed at a glance. Now I glance at the app and have to search for the current temperature. Oh wait, there it is. I didn't notice it because it's in a tiny font size, dwarfed by the wind warning right beneath it. Sadly, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to listing all the terrible, idiotic choices made when TWC decided to completely redesign their app. The old one was perfect. This new one is a disaster."
2236,Ac2341,"January 8, 2019",1,Sells your location history The app uses your location history to target ads. They even sell your location history to others so they may target ads to you even outside of the app. This should really be made clear in the description. Location based ads that are shown WITHIN the app are very different from using our location history to target ads across various websites. And selling our location history is even worse. I expected that from Facebook but not Weather Channel.
2237,Teeemeee,"March 11, 2019",1,"Latest update is a NIGHTMARE This latest update has caused nothing but havoc and seriously needs to be fixed. Blue screen of death frequently occurs, pretty much upon every single time of opening. I have to close it down a few times before it decides if it’s going to load for the day or not. "
2238,JHBrother,"March 21, 2019",4,4.5 stars Love this app. Would of given it 5 stars although sometimes the radar is inaccurate about where the precipitation actually is or isn’t happening. It’s says it’s raining and it’s not or the other way around. It’s says it’s not raining and it is or glitches and doesn’t load. Overall I recommend this app over whether bug and accu whether.
2239,KensS,"May 12, 2019",1,"Deleted App After years of using the Weather Channel App on my iPhone I finally deleted it and am using Weather Bug. I found the latest updates  made it harder and harder to see the information needed. The icons are small, muted in color, and only about 25% of the screen has weather data. I don’t know who approved these changes. "
2240,CKMF Danny,"September 7, 2018",3,"CKMF I loved this app and used it daily. It’s likely I’ll be looking for a different weather app because I simply hate it after the latest update. It used to much easier to read and follow. I know you’re thinking people just don’t like change, but I’m not one of those people. This update just took this app in the wrong direction. Pre update I would have rated it a five, now it’s a one for me, but that averages to a three. Sorry!"
2241,fedexairbus,"September 10, 2018",2,New iPhone app is not good The new weather channel app is awful. I have it two stars but that’s because I’m being generous. I hate the graphs. It’s tough looking up different locations. Getting my daily and hourly info is confusing and I don’t want graphs. Period. No graphs. I hate the general look of the new version. Wow.  Go back to what it was or quickly change this app. Hope you didn’t pay too much for this version cuz my family has been getting our info elsewhere lately.
2242,NRGeticRad,"September 11, 2018",3,Where’s the quick 5-day forecast?! There is no way to see a 5-day (or more) forecast other than scrolling through the daily forecasts?! That’s very inefficient. The rest of he app looks WAY better than it did before though! I’m rating this at 3 stars because as a weather app you should be able to view the forecast for multiple days easily and this version doesn’t allow that.
2243,JulesMack6,"September 11, 2018",1,"So bad, writing my first review The weather channel app used to be my go to for weather until they “updated” the app and software. I live in North Carolina and the hurricane plowing towards us is not even on the radar. Not only that, there used to be page for warnings and alerts. That’s gone. The app is now something that looks like a beginner’s coding class in high school planned it. Graphics are awful. Background is stark white. The graphing is horrific, in that the highs and lows of every day are a single wavy line that looks the same. There is NOTHING redeeming about this app anymore."
2244,Amh123098,"September 13, 2018",1,"New update is awful If I could give zero stars I would. I’ve always used this app but am seriously about to delete it. I like being able to open the app and quickly check the daily forecast. I cannot do that anymore since the update. The way it appears now with the stupid wave makes it difficult to discern which forecast goes with which day. I don’t use it since the update, for me it isn’t useable and will e deleted soon if something is done to remedy this. This update is a complete debacle. You screwed up a good app."
2245,music_lover_15031402,"September 17, 2018",1,Deleted the app after latest update I’ve had the Weather Channel app on my phone for as long as I’ve had a smart phone. The latest update prompted me to switch to a different app. Here’s why:
2246,Sierra Lia Slots,"September 25, 2018",1,"C’mon You Can Do Better Hate the new layout. The old one was much more user friendly and gave me everything I needed to know. This update has been a nightmare. I get the banner alerts and every time I click on it, it now goes to the splash page and just spins. Never loads. I find myself using Accuweather much more now, where yours used to be my #1 go to. Please take a step back and simplify. There was really no reason to completely change the look, unless it’s just a way to make money. You will lose money if no one uses the app!"
2247,Tcmskps,"September 29, 2018",1,Awful Update I’ve used the Weather Channel app for years and there have been a ton of changes but this one is by far the worst! This used to be my go to app for weather and now it is just a mess. It was nice when I could easily navigate seeing the weather forecast and radar but now it’s so bombarded with ads and videos that I don’t even want to open the app and have gone back to the basic weather app on my phone. I will sacrifice having the radar feature because the Weather Channel app is so horrible now.
2248,gggjikol,"October 2, 2018",5,New is not always the best. The new version is not as user friendly as the last version was. I find the white background harder to see and the fonts used are too small. Then there is the navigation issues .   Bring back the older version. Much simpler to use.
2249,Stop this,"October 8, 2018",1,The beautifully reimagined design is not so beautiful There have been improvements since the original large layout change but the app is still lacking. I prefer the apple weather app now.
2250,ect734,"August 8, 2018",2,"Too much clicking and I don’t get what I want I updated to this version on my iPad (as I was warned to do every day for weeks). No more humidity info, except for current, which I relied on. It feels like every forecast is so equivocal (chance of rain) that it really doesn’t tell you anything. Yeah, it might rain!?! I’m searching for a different app."
2251,BIGBetts,"August 29, 2018",5,"Great Way to Start the Day I wake up with TWC App every morning! It gives me the daily and weekly information I need to get out and get going. I enjoy the videos which are up to the minute. The ads can be annoying, but that’s the cost of business; I skip the if possible. Keep up the good work, TWC!"
2252,Sireena11,"August 30, 2018",2,Hate the update I used to use this app for years to quick check the weather in the morning and now it updates and I’m very mad about the new layout. I just want the day to day forecast like it was before all blocked out and easy to read and now we get these squiggle graphs that are not only hard to read but super ugly. And the amount of adds is rediculous and makes loading the weather slow. Would not recommend this app to anyone anymore.
2253,dss151,"August 31, 2018",1,"Not liking new app at all Not sure why you changed the app, likely it was revenue driven to add the static ad at bottom of the page and to drive more people to videos with pre-roll commercials. The design looks retro, in a bad way, it is not intuitive and you lost the at a glance 15 day forecast I used the most when planning. I have used this weather app exclusively for years and will now be looking at others that may be easier to use, with less clicks required to get to what I want and will better serve my planning needs. Bummer."
2254,Toddguy99,"September 3, 2018",2,"Radar lags, too many videos & ads Just updated to newest version. Radar still is hard to use. It will show the current radar, but when I hit future play they layers go away and aren’t visible. Past play works sometimes. It acts like it can’t handle the data. This is on cellular LTE and on my hone WiFi which is quite strong. New version as of 9-1-18 is hard to see.  Previous version much easier on the eyes.  Just want weather information not flow charts."
2255,SLaneE,"September 3, 2018",3,The radar doesn’t show up I’m disappointed with the new app.  Most of my family switched to another weather app.  I may do that as well.  The reason:  it takes forever to get the radar to show anything.  I don’t understand why.  It worked before the upgrade. I use the hourly and the radar features almost exclusively. I need to be able to rely on what I’m seeing or it doesn’t do me any good.
2256,Flyin_hooch,"September 3, 2018",1,"Terrible changes forecasted ahead What is the reason for the major changes to this app? The previous versions were enjoyable and easy to use. This “downgrade” is simply confusing and illogical. Why redesign and completely change an app NOT in need of change? And seriously, the videos are simply annoying. If I want to watch tv, well, that’s what a tv is for. What’s wanted is a simply, easy to use, informative and functional weather app so I can quickly and easily get an idea of the weather forecast. This is NOT the answer."
2257,Stacy in WI,"September 3, 2018",1,"Awful NEW re-design The new, re-design is awful and has made the weather channel app useless.  I’ve tried and tried to use it and I’m giving up.  You’ve changed it to the point of it no longer being informative.  I can’t find what I want or the cities listing I need.  We live in a different city than we work and in a different  city than where our kids go to school.  I need to be able to quickly check the weather in multiple cities.  Your article about the update and your research is a joke.  Goodbye."
2258,Derboo,"September 6, 2018",1,Not as good as previous. Too much white space on first page with just a couple expected  temperatures listed throughout the day. Waste of valuable space that could be used for more information. Need to make the text larger too hard to read. Gray letters don’t have enough contrast with the background. Other pages also have too much white space. This could be filled with more data and reduce the number of pages to flip through. AccuWeather has a much better lay out in the use of space and information

I have turned sounds off in settings but the video still plays sound and auto plays rather then let me decide if/when I want to watch it. Most often I just want to read rather than watch a video."

We have the family share plan, so I thought that the ad free version would be available on my account for my family. I went to the feedback and support section in the app only to discover that paying for the ad free version only works for the year. You have to repurchase the app every year. I realize the $4 is not a lot of money, but it’s pretty deceiving to think that you’re buying an app when in reality you are only renting for the year."
2262,Judhead,"April 15, 2018",2,"Slow This app is the slowest app to open on my phone. They have too many videos and ads the have to download just to open the app. Once it gets open, it usually works, but sometimes crashes. Sometimes it will allow you to check the weather in other locations, sometimes you can’t. All this boils down to too many videos and ads on each page, which slows the entire app down. I’m looking for another weather app now."
2263,SailorShim,"April 24, 2018",3,"Notifications won’t stay off! I use my phone for work and have turned off the notifications for ALL weather in this app.  About a month ago, I noticed that they automatically turn back on as soon as I close the app.  It’s not only annoying but also a distraction.  I’m seriously thinking about deleting this app and downloading something different if it isn’t changed soon."
2264,Mother traveler,"May 9, 2018",5,Thanks I have been using the weather app for several years and have found it quite accurate. I have children and others in various different states and enjoy knowing what they are experiencing with the weather-especially when planning to visit.
2265,Agar2377,"May 15, 2018",2,Alerts. Go away!! I used to only get alerts for severe weather in my county or where I actually was. Now I get rain alerts and all sorts of alerts for weather in another county. Checked all my settings. Only for my current location. Ended up turning off ALL alerts. Today I’m getting rain alerts again and I got into app and alerts have been turned back on.  I actually like having this app but will be deleting if it doesn’t stop sending useless alerts.
2266,Kentucky barber boy,"May 24, 2018",2,"Doesn’t work anymore. Most recent update broke the app. It doesn’t even open now. It was decent before this happened. Doing away with Storm (formerly presented by Weather Underground) is, in my opinion, a mistake. It’s a great, very solid weather app. Sadly, it has been replaced by Storm Radar, which looks great, but that’s where it ends. Good ol’ Storm was easy to understand and navigate. Seems like The Weather Channel acquiring Weather Underground has taken away more than it has given. Bummer."
2267,Jazzd-Flats,"June 3, 2018",2,"Disappointed in recent improvements Scrolling to get to the info that used to be front and center is frustrating. But the worst feature is how slow the radar image loads. I just did the latest update in hopes radar performance would improve.  I tested my iPad WiFi and have great speed, so why is it taking over 2 minutes to load a radar picture?  Weather underground loaded radar in a few seconds. Off to find a better app."

The Doppler is off by several hours if it gets it right at all… Fourth of July the fireworks got canceled and I was sitting in thunder and lightning with no ride because my weather channel says it would be beautiful until 1030 that night… By 8 o’clock we were being evacuated from the stadium. Thanks for nothing worthless app...If I could trust you I would’ve known to stay home and save my money that night
2269,Buckmir,"July 8, 2018",5,Changes Why did you eliminate highs and lows positions and tracking. This has been taught even in grade schools to know which way they rotate and the Coriolis effect on all. Have you decided the AMERICAN public has Ben dumbed Down?
2270,LoveToDance0321,"January 20, 2018",1,Random Pop Up Ads App works well but random pop up ads appear that take up the entire screen.  I get the need for advertising it it should not stop the function of the app.  This issue just started within the past few weeks.  I am deleting the app for Weather Bug and will check in a few months to see if this ridiculous annoyance is corrected.  UPDATE - Weather Bug is a much better app.  Same information except the future radar and NO ANNOYING POP UPS.  Will not be going back to Weather Channel.

I have been using this app for a few years and was able to see the hourly forecast which helps me in my decision making for work. Now they are asking me to pay $4.99 a month to be able to look ahead more than 8 hours. To the CEO and board that decision was a bad movie. I will find another weather app. Besides you all get most of your information from NOAA, so there is really no reason for me to have this app."

How many inches are we getting today? How will today compare to tomorrow? And more. Frustrating, just felt I had to tell you.

I was forced to delete it and reload. Got the new format and it really stinks. Very busy screen. Please go back to the easy to view simplicity of the old app. I am probably going to delete this app again. There are other better easier to read options. Also I would never pay no ads unless the format is fixed! Toooo busy. Get back to basic info please.
2279,Eolidia,"January 23, 2020",1,"I want the old app back I couldn’t open the weather app today, so I deleted it, and went to re-download it. Imagine my surprise when I opened the new one, and it was no longer the same. Where are the beautiful opening pictures? The old app was so easy to see and use. I was easily able to set up multiple locations (helpful when traveling) and to also see weather in international travel destinations. This new app has information I don’t need or want. Please simplify it. And most of all I hate the advertisements!"

It was nothing special for accuracy (basically just the NOAA data) but it was reliable and easy to understand . Today it stopped working, so I went to the App Store to see if I needed an upgrade.  Downloaded the latest and greatest, tried to see what tomorrow’s weather is going to be, it and gave up. The previously simple user interface has been replaced with a hodgepodge of crap, advertising and pop ups."

I’ve been using the weather channel app since they’ve had the app. In this last update they’re focused on getting everyone to pay for the app to get rid of ads, so they’ve riddled the entire app with so many ads, it’s not enjoyable to use the app anymore. I’ve had to start using other apps due to the plethora of ads. I know you want to make money, but going from 0 to 1000 gets rid of users - I won’t be paying for the app, and I’ll likely get my weather elsewhere until they get their heads out of their ..."

The info I’m seeking is almost always now buried under a full page upgrade banner, and the radar map is baulky now as well as continually going to an ad page. It’s pretty annoying. Oh, and the highly touted premium upgrade offers only two relatively minor features. I think it’s biggest selling point is getting rid of the annoying ads. "
2284,Dawglover1983,"November 23, 2019",3,"Your ads The idea that it’s a good thing to watch the SAME ad OVER AND OVER before you’re allowed to watch a video is not a good thing. It’s ridiculous. Your app is the only one that does this. Can’t we watch the ad once and be done? I got it the first time!!  I’ve stopped trying to watch the stories because of this. Fix it, please. I love your app otherwise, but I can’t get information in a timely manner anymore."
2285,Ianfact,"November 15, 2019",2,Adds 🙄 I liked this app earlier on in its previous versions before the updates ruined the interface. The most annoying part of the updated app for me lately has been the incessant ads. Every single time I open the app I am met with an ad I immediately need to close out before I can look at the weather. Thinking about moving to another weather app because I’m sick and tired of the constant advertising popping up every time I try to use it.

Now if I want to see the hourly or ten day, I have to scroll. It’s so annoying. When will developers realize change for change sake is not a good thing. Big changes should make sense and be a benefit. This design was poorly thought out as are most things these days. Though, the information is fairly accurate."
2287,Bamalivinnittanylion,"October 18, 2019",3,"Beware Updates Avout every 3 or 4 updates, videos on the app become problematic. The app will restart when you try to play a video.

Maybe Weather Channel should push out less updates to make sure the updates work.... hey Apple.... good advice for you too."

I run this on an iPad with plenty of mr Roy and high speed internet connection over WiFi. It’s rather ridiculous how long I need to wait for the radar map to load, let alone go through the slideshow. I’m not certain how he old app was lacking and seems the changes were made just for change sake or job justification. I have used the Weather Channel app for years, but going to look for something else."

I thought that I would just need to get used to it and eventually It would seem more user friendly. Well it’s been at least a few months now and I still cannot stand it! Maybe other people like this format??? But for me, it’s much less user friendly and harder to read. It’s kind of like reading a book now rather than bullet points..."

I used the hourly info regularly, and loved that it went out more than 1 day. Lost the expanded hourly forecast, and I also dislike the graphic version vs the simple vertical list. I haven’t updated the app on my iPhone, since I saw how cumbersome the new version is on my iPad. I’ll be extremely disappointed if/when the old version is no longer supported and I’ll be forced to switch or find another app to use on my phone."
2292,jmc629,"March 14, 2019",1,Not Good Anymore I’ve used this app for about 10 years now. Always has been my go to for weather info and was amazing. Would always be what I’d suggest to other people as well. But about a year or so ago they completely remade the app and redesigned how it looks. The interface is now more complicated and makes it harder to find what you’re looking for. Recently it has been crashing every other time when I try to open it. Progress and innovation is usually a good thing but in this case it was not.

The app constantly lags and crashes, and if I use the app for more than 5 minutes to check the radar, my battery is drained by nearly 40%. One app should not be draining half a battery life in a matter of minutes. On the contrary, the graphic design is quite pleasant and very well done."

2301,TBP.com,"September 24, 2018",1,New design is terrible. The new design is so flat and bright it hurts my eyes to look at. The daily view has the highs and lows separated into wide individual columns and it’s hard to tell which day your looking at.  Just really really poor design where nothing stands out so your eye just kind of spaces out and has a hard time tracking to the info you need.  Good luck viewing this at night as it will blind you even if the screen brightness is turned down. Who ever green lighted this design should be fired and never work in a creative environment ever again

It’s great that they want to present more info at what they think is a convenient layout, but if it looks terrible, it doesn’t matter as people are less likely to use it. Stop trying to copy the layouts other services use and just be the best Weather Channel app that your established typical viewers/users want and expect."

The new update removed the most useful part of the app for me which is the week at a glance. The new week at a glance is difficult to use and difficult to understand. I don’t need a wavy line telling me that temperature increases and decreases every day, but that’s the biggest take away from this visual. Please just tell me the high and the low with some kind of sun/clouds/rain combination to describe the weather and remove this flashy garbage. I’m going back to the built in app."

I really dislike the new ‘look’ of the app. Changing something that drastically after people have had years of another layout is just annoying.

There is no longer a UV index at all. The weekly forecast has been taken away and you have to navigate the whole app just to see hourly. The most inconvenient update to anything that I have ever experienced. The charts displayed on the homepage are stupid and don’t give a good reputation of the day. Do not download. Find something more usable and informative."
2315,SierraC1,"September 12, 2018",1,Very Disappointed I used to use the Weather Channel app daily and many times checked it more than once because I work outside and like to know if the weather is expected to change. Unfortunately you had to change it and it is no longer simple and easy to check the forecast especially the extended forecast. I don’t even bother to check the weather on this app because I don’t have all day to figure out what the weather will be. I am better off looking at the sky and guessing

I used the prior version’s 15 day forecast to plan my run/x-country ski/outdoor activities.  I understand the probability of inaccuracies in our area, but, it was helpful to see hi/low temps and precipitation percentages in a glance. Now I have to read through verbiage to try to summarize the same info.  I’ve gone to the WC webpage and find it much more useful for my needs.

Now with this most recent update the ads are back and it says “nothing to restore”.  $30 per year or $4.99 a month???  I don’t think so especially when you completely redesigned the app and I hated the new video format.  I will be searching for something else that has a one time purchase fee.

Ever since they added Premium, the ads take up more space than the things within the app itself. Every time I open the app, the offer to buy premium pops up. Ever time I go to the daily forecast, pop up ads have to be dismissed or the app force closes because the ads are wildly unstable. I wanted to keep using this app, but I won’t be any longer."

I hate having to X out of the “premium option” just to see the temperature. When I click on daily, I don’t care about reading a sentence for day and night and I don’t want to scroll through videos, I just want the high/low temperature and rain chance. It’s just irritating as a long time user. I’m going to give something else a chance."

Why the heck do I want to know what the hourly weather was like in the past?  I am going to take a wild guess and say that it’s like this now because you guys are trying to push the “premium” crap."

I still like a lot of its features so I’ll stay with it for now since I believe I’m not the only person with this issue.

First they upgraded the original Storm App (which was the best weather app before being upgraded) to the recent new piece of garbage Storm App and then they upgraded the weather channel app to this current complicated disaster app which doesn’t work half the time. For those who want something better try MyRadar, BeWeather, or 1Weather - Their will never be anything as good as the original Storm App but the combination of these three gets you close"

The opening view of “today” is a uselsss chart that looks identical to the daily chart except it doesn’t scroll right or left (which unnatural to the thumbs). In order to see what you’d expect when opening a weather app, you must scroll down several times to see actual details of the current weather. It’s entirely over complicated for a weather app. And it’s the clunkiest it’s ever been."

In the past, the app was simple to use and completely user-friendly. All information (hourly, daily, weekly) was on one easy to see page with useful graphics. The new one requires opening various tabs and more confusing graphics. I will not be using it until they correct its deficiencies. So sad. It was a great app until they ruined it."

It’s not practical or easy to read several days at once since the information is now landscape. That rolling line is going to give someone a seizure.  Scrolling to the right for everything is annoying when the natural tendency is to scroll up or down with your thumb. It has also frozen every single time I’ve been on it. Every. Time.

I close the app after seeing the notification and you notify me of something else the second I leave the app. I get it the world is ending, but do you have to disrupt our day 50+ times to let me know California is on fire? I mean the world knows, as Darryl said to Andy in the office “You’re one bad text away from being cut off forever”"
2420,Jbtgrt,"April 21, 2019",5,Mr. T With my work and loving to camp the weather app is my life line for local and a far weather forecast!! We have it on all our smart phones and iPads!! It’s a great tool for me with my work. It helps me to plan out at the most (for my use) 3 days. If you travel and love to be out doors or just staying local it’s a App to have.
2421,Capernaum12,"May 23, 2019",1,"Refuse to Update I use this app but only because I’m still running version 9.12 with the beautiful blue background. Still works. I’ve seen the new version and I occasionally check the reviews here to see if any serious users have come around to liking version 10 but the answer continues to be overwhelmingly, “NO!”  I primarily use a local tv station’s wx app now that has real meteorological forecasts ... rather than a single computer model prediction. (ie. The Weather Channel app.) The MyRadar app is quickly becoming a better national tool. #Sad"
2422,The Evangelist!,"June 1, 2019",5,"Marvin K. Have tried other weather Aaps but the Weather Channel beats them all. Why? Very thorough, I can trust it wherever I go and helps navigate any impending storms whenever possible, via your radar. The alarm warnings are great, gives me a heads up on an incoming storm. Keep up the great work! I also use this via my TV set. Your grade is A+++"
2423,Mr. B25,"June 2, 2019",5,"A must have Recently downloaded and I’m shocked I didn’t download sooner. For the most part, reports have been accurate or close too. The design of the app and the integration have been great. For those who enjoy following the weather or needing an accurate update, this app is recommended."
2424,Calumet906,"October 13, 2019",1,"Used my location in the background 870 times last three days. Title says it all. Is there a particular reason why this app has used my location 870 times last three days and ran in the background for a total of almost 23 hours? That’s over 12 times an hour, mostly being stationary at a particular location. Location never properly updates despite the excessive “refresh” of my location. It is set to “always allow”. Please fix the issue and optimize the app. Thank you."
2425,mackpey,"September 3, 2019",5,Public Health I work as a program lead nurse that observes people and their care on a daily basis. There are times that it is necessary to go to their homes. The weather channel is indispensable in coordinating these trips and allows for a more fluid flow in management of our outreach program. Thank  you for this wonderful support in public health.

I can’t be the only one!"
2428,MinnesotaMare,"June 19, 2019",1,"BOGUS RADAR! With all the technology the Weather Channel tells us they have, WHY does the radar show green for rain over my house and I’m sitting outside in blue sky and sunshine? Last week we made sure we were home by 4pm for the radar forecast was Red/Orange/Yellow and again we got no rain. The week prior I checked the radar for Past and Future. The Green/Yellow blob that was forecasted made us decide to head home from our outing and again it never rained. Radar from The Weather Channel is nothing but a joke on all of us! Totally Unreliable app."
2429,Shogomoc,"June 14, 2019",2,"Used to be great app I have used this app for years, it is my go to weather source.  With that being said, the app has been increasingly complicated and difficult to navigate. The proliferation of ihe adds are not only annoying but use up to much real estate on the screen. I don’t mind paying someone for their hard work, but the interface is just like a big bowl of seafood chowder. I will unfortunately be deleting this app today.  Maybe a revisit in the future"

I used to use the Weather Channel app as my weather bible but over time you’ve added videos and content that is not what I need to know my weather!  And what on earth did you do to the app with this latest version?!  It is TERRIBLE!!  Horribly slow to load, hard to navigate and read. I feel like you’ve just ruined the whole experience. I’m deleting. I keep wanting to come back to find it better and I’m having the opposite more frustrating experience each time."
2431,Teresa A McQ,"November 18, 2018",2,Too many screens to get info I dislike the newest updates. I’ve tried to like them. I’ve given them months to try to adjust to the major change. All the info that use to be on one screen is now on multiple and you have to hunt for it every time. I find myself opening the other weather apps for info now. Sad because this use to be my go to. I do like that I get notifications of pending weather but that’s about all I like.
2432,surfallday757,"January 9, 2019",2,"Change isn’t always good The recent update to the app is completely horrible. The daily, weekly, and hourly views being horizontal is odd...the individual tiles for categories makes the app seem cluttered instead of a simple menu people look for in a weather app.  I’ve used the weather channel app for years but think it is time to go with a more simple app to check the weather daily until the weather channel app corrects this major failure."
2433,Jen1178,"January 22, 2019",1,"Horrible layout Ever since these new updates, the layout is horrible. You have to go and search for daily stuff. It is very useless. It’s no longer a user friendly app anymore. The old version you open up and automatically see what to plan for the day. I saw a developer response, and all they could say is it gives more weather updates. From now on I will stick with my local news forecast. As a quick fix, you should have somewhere to be able to view the older style app."

The update itself wasn’t great, it made the most useful information harder to get to. Additionally, the app was very slow to open, and sometimes wouldn’t open at all. I thought after several more updates maybe they’d get the kinks worked out, or maybe I’d grow to like the new update...but nope! Can’t stand it, after years of usinng this app I deleted it from my phone. Bring back the older version! 1 star because it was unusable."

2437,the subjected frequent shopper,"March 11, 2019",4,Loved it—would love it more Loved the weather app until they recently took away the option to have ‘favorite’ cities to check the weather just a click away...and without telling anyone.  Not crazy about the new look—to me it wasn’t broken so it wasn’t needing fixed.  Still my most dependable and fav weather app.
2438,Burning River Rob,"March 21, 2019",3,"Good When It Works About half the time I try to use the app, I get a blank blue screen & have to clear the cache from my iPhone before it will load. I’ve deleted/reinstalled the app 3 times to no avail. The updates are ok - change is a good thing - and when it works it’s even accurate sometimes. Easy to use and nicely designed, but please fix the bugs! This has gone on for months!!"
2439,Hoodges,"April 15, 2019",2,"New Update has made the app hardly ever work Loved this app, since the new update it has been extremely slow or just doesn’t work.  Also, think I’m done with this app.  I just want the weather not videos with people telling me how the world is ending and  being overly dramatic.  Most videos are about how bad everything is, so I’m gonna delete this politically driven app and download something that tells me the weather and one that actually works."

2441,Ittybitty_earley,"September 4, 2018",2,"New App Confusing I do not like the the navigation with this latest update. It is “confusing” because everything is “in one” now. I don’t know how to better explain what I’m trying to say other than please keep hourly, daily and extended separate. The layout of the last version was perfect, the only problem was the ads and videos loading first so everything went slow. I like that it’s faster, but the “presentation” is off putting."
2442,mamashocka,"September 5, 2018",1,"Not so great update I don’t usually write reviews but this app update is bad enough to make me write one. I see I’m not the only one who is not liking this update. It is much harder to see. The wavy lines makes it difficult to tell what day you’re looking at . Overall it’s not user friendly and very frustrating to use. I see so many people preferred the pre update version, hopefully the Weather channel will take these reviews under consideration and revert back to the previous version or something much more like it."
2443,Sunnielegs,"September 5, 2018",1,Latest app update...why? I’m going to find another app. The white background hurts my eyes. 
2444,Tsherrick,"September 6, 2018",1,"Worst Update Yet! Absolutely hate the new update! It is not aesthetically pleasing! The chart at the top gives me no information that I am interested in, plus it looks ridiculous. None of the other 6 pages provide weather data that I need! Way to push out the data and bring in more nonsense videos and advertisements! Only good thing about this app is that it’s still free! No wonder your television station was cancelled! Keep these kind of updates coming and everyone will find a different weather app to use!"
2445,Crush nomore,"September 8, 2018",1,Latest update There is a saying if something isn’t broke don’t fix it. Your latest update is a nightmare. It was easy to know what the current temperature was . Now there is a graph for the entire day. I have never had someone ask to know what the temperature an hour ago. I guess for this app simple is not the best. I don’t need an app to give a hourly summary of the days temperature. I like that you could scroll up and down for what you were looking for. Now it’s not as easy. Very bad update. Looking for a less complex weather app.
2446,chmwgfn1993,"September 9, 2018",1,New update has changed my mind completely The new update has made things so much more complicated to read. The boldness of the original app was so much better on my eyes than the skinny light blue words and numbers on a white background. The line graph going through the week makes it really difficult to follow. 
2447,wadjet1,"September 15, 2018",2,"Updated app is difficult to read I like the weather channel, but I do not like its latest update to the layout and text on its mobile app."
2448,Eventer83,"September 17, 2018",3,"Too complicated I like streamlined apps. This is way too busy for just weather. I appreciate the bottom banner with menu options but the upper half is just terrible design. Not intuitive by any means. i just want to know the temp, basic forecast and any important weather alerts! Keep details as a collapsible option you can click to get to instead of having it all laid out on one screen."
2449,CoNoonan,"September 25, 2018",1,"Update has made app unusable Have used this app as my only weather info for daily info and to get severe weather alerts. I work outdoors and having quick, easy to find, and accurate weather information is very important. Since the update, the app has become unusable for me. The odd line graphs, clumsy requirement to flip between screens, inconsistent radar functionality, and overall poor functionality has led me to no longer feel comfortable with TWC as my source of weather information."
2450,AnnabelleLeeCee,"June 21, 2018",2,Not an improvement The newest version is so Graphic-heavy it takes a while to load. You can still have favorite locations but have to return to the home screen to switch locations. And worst of all is the forecasting -the only place humidity is displayed is in the “current” screen. No where can you see how humid the weather will be in the future. Which makes the forecasts pretty useless if you live anywhere that humidity is a factor.
2451,Vincecan11,"July 2, 2018",5,"Fear Mongers I’m finally deleting the wc app. It’s a shame because it’s great for the weather. I loved getting my weather and not hearing about all the gory things on the news.

2452,jayte2018,"July 3, 2018",1,"The latest version is terrible! I’ve used a weather channel app for years.  Then this past year they changed it.  I believe they added Watson to improve accuracy.  It was fine before.  I don’t care if the rai is arriving at my home at 10:32AM.  I just want quick and generally reliable weather.  It’s good to know what hours of the day weather will change, I don’t need to know the minute!  Now the app is slow to load, and not very interestingly designed.  I’m going looking for a new solution!  I’m fed up with this one."
2453,PrincessCone999,"August 27, 2018",1,"Hate the changes! Ok, in all my years using apps I’ve never taken time to leave a review...until today when they changed the entire format of this app. This was my favorite weather app for a reason and now it’s the same stupid format as the others. I haven’t even needed to look at other weather apps until today.  My husband is a weather nut so he’s into a bunch of them because of all the busyness they come with...I guess he’ll start using this one now because that’s exactly what it is now."

2455,Drw4338,"August 30, 2018",1,Version 10.0 is absolutely horrible Keep it simple people! What happened to the simple weekly outlook? It was so nice and clean before. It was easy to read. Now I have to look at graphs and try to interpret them? I’m always on the move. I don’t have time for that. Don’t fix what isn’t broke! You guys are spending more time on making it look fancy than on its function. Now the app is worthless to me. Take a lesson from Google and their gmail. Give us the option to go back to the classic look if we don’t like the update!
2456,Wjgold,"August 30, 2018",3,"Great new changes EXCEPT!!!!! I miss the loss of the side swipe 15-day forecast. The new pull-down replacement makes it time-consuming and impossible to see the upcoming expectations at a glance. I miss it so much that I am looking for a weather app that can bring that favorite quick overview back! If support will reply to my concern, I will share my idea of how to fix it without having to turn back that major mistake (as I see it)."

There are so many things I don’t like, I just can’t believe it.  It’s not easy to read.  The days are not separate enough that you can glance at it and figure out what you’re looking at.  Everything is the same light color scheme so it’s difficult to really tell anything apart.  There’s more but you get the gist.  It’s just frustrating.  Change it back!!!!"
2459,R. Brian Long,"September 3, 2018",2,"Terrible Changes to the App Way too many screens to have to open!!! I do not like having to tap on several different boxes to get the info. It was soooooo much better when most all the data was on one screen and you just scrolled down. And all that white is distracting. It was very pretty to look at now it just looks too technical!! Please bring back the old version!! I have solely used this app for 10 yrs, but if it stays like this, I will have to move on."
2460,Itsmejewels,"February 4, 2018",4,Map and weather I would think you could integrate a directional map like google map and weather radar into one. That way a driver would not have to switch back and forth to see weather while traveling and still get real time directions and weather. I think it is a good idea and would buy that app.

But overall, I think this is a great app and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family."

The upgrade probably has more weather stuff in it but my interest is satisfied by the original App. It seems easier to navigate and I’ll stay with that for as long as I can."
2464,Cowboy 9690,"May 21, 2018",1,Tired of glitching radar and weather forecast being wrong Have been using this app for years. The radar glitches and jumps so bad now it’s useless. It can be showing an 80% chance of rain for the next day but when you look at hourly it’s only 60% for an hour. Or says there’s only a 20% chance of rain but hourly  says 80% for several hours. The ads on the videos have also gotten out of hand. In my profession I need to know exactly what the weather is going to be. Will be deleting this useless app.
2465,Pheonyxe,"May 27, 2018",1,"Never loads Ever since the app update all I ever see is the loading screen.  If I wanted to wait an hour for the weather, I’d just watch the news.  I have an up to date iPhone 7, there’s no reason for this app not to work on my end.  Maybe re-simplify this app, get rid of the ads and the videos, all anyone cares about when installing this app is the weather.  Considering I can now just ask Alexa for the weather, I don’t see the point of keeping such a clunky app around, especially if it no longer loads."

Besides having to learn how to use it all over again, I can’t find one of the things I need most, seeing the weather in favorite locations. When I tried to give feedback, I couldn’t submit it. Things need to be upgraded again."

I get a pop up that says the either select location or cancel. When you select location there is nothing to select. You are forced to select cancel and this turns alerts off. Please fix. I’ve already tried to delete and reinstall.
2468,Rubbish queen,"May 1, 2020",4,"Good app It’s a good app. I also find if helps not just knowing the temperature, but also knowing what type of weather is coming your way.

2470,Tuneagelvr,"March 13, 2020",3,New radar format=Bad I’ve tried to like the new radar format with a ⅓ of the bottom of the radar being controls. But cannot get used to it. Previous version was a lot better. Unsubscribed from premium today because of it. I like the other features but radar was the biggest reason for downloading. I wish there was a way to take it back a version!

2472,Nails and Chalkboards,"February 9, 2020",2,"Used to be a decent app I used this app exclusively for a number of years, and over time they have cluttered it up with more and more pop-ups, video links and garbage to the point that it is now almost useless.  The amount of detailed information has been drastically reduced as well, and requires more clicks to find (no accident I’m sure, you are just as likely to fumble and hit one of their sponsored links).  I recommend passing this one by and using Dark Sky."

The 7 day app will no longer open and I wondering if it was some grandfathered premium app. I would purchase the premium but I can’t find what it looks like.  What happened?

Ever since that update it seems like it’s become a bloated mess, and runs WAY slower. The interface is laggy and no longer pleasant to use. And why am I being hassled to buy a premium subscription for a WEATHER APP? I could literally use the default iOS weather app that also gets its data from the weather channel. A big shame"
2481,killer kouki,"November 9, 2019",2,"Was a good app Used to load very quickly. Not only is it slower, but every time you open the app you get an advertisement to upgrade to their premium app. I’m a father who is constantly on the go, and I need to be able to quickly pull up the weather report (beyond just checking the temp) so I can get out the door quickly. Otherwise, the app is very intuitive, has a good radar feature, and is pretty accurate with its weather report."

2491,katiria89,"January 15, 2019",5,It doesn’t open up ? Review is not a bad one I’m totally happy with it ! Just wondering why doesn’t the app open up? I press the app it tries to load -doesn’t and it sends me back to my home screen...I also updated it thinking that was what was causing the app crash but it wasn’t... help ???
2492,FrustratedTrainmaster,"January 19, 2019",4,"Where are the weather fronts and pressure high/low Your app is fairly easy to use but you did have the ability to show low pressure systems and high pressure systems.  Also I was able to have cold fronts, warm fronts, and occluded fronts.  Nowhere to be found.  I do not want to hear that they are only in the paid for version.  Please include so we can see what is happening."
2493,usmkid,"January 20, 2019",5,"Much Better but Dancing Clouds? I really have enjoyed the latest update to the app.  Personally I hated the previous version.  This one is so much better.  The “dancing clouds” were cute and got my attention, but after a couple of times I think they dance way too long. I like the graphed data.  Very useful app."
2494,Pspam,"February 24, 2019",2,Disappointed with the new subscription model I have been using this app for years. It is slow to load but I really like the layout of the information. The ads are intrusive. I quickly paid the one time $4 upgrade to the ad free version. Now they want $4 annually? That in my opinion is way too much for a weather app. 
2495,userDTdc,"March 4, 2019",2,"Crashes during launch App crashes every time I try opening it after not using it for a few hours. When I try to reopen it right after it crashes, it opens successfully. I even tried to delete and re-install the app but it continues to crash on the first attempt. This has happened consistently for months. "
2496,erihal,"May 20, 2019",4,Fahrenheit and Celsius Request Hi. I really enjoy your app. I have a suggestion that would help me and others. I am a US citizen but work with people around the globe. I’d like to have an option where the forecasts show Fahrenheit and Celsius on the same screen at the same time without toggling between the two. 
2497,Critical Customer,"May 31, 2019",1,"Slow, inaccurate, and slow! No longer a fan. I’ve used this app for several years and it has become increasingly unreliable and I’ve become increasingly disappointed. It gets slower with every update, it’s infested with ads which further slow it down, the radar is needs some work and did I mention it’s slow? It takes forever to load and then when it finally does, it “hiccups and burps” to jump between the Today, Hourly, and Dailey views. Please...streamline this so it works better."
2498,MezzoBassist,"June 23, 2019",2,"Trying too much, giving too little The new app interface makes you WORK to find weather information. After at least 5 years of this app I likely need to look elsewhere. Finding things like lightening strikes and other info that was previously easy to locate- now its impossible and causes me to look on my local news instead. I know people don’t like change. But do you even user test, bro?!!!"
2499,aksjenensj,"June 19, 2019",5,Awesome app Very informative. Always 99.9% correct on the weather. The app is just a very easy and trustworthy app to use.

I have been checking back on this for a few weeks now and nope. It's not that I am change resistant the look, the usability, the one glance for information is gone. "
2501,diappointesm17,"September 30, 2018",5,Most recent update I HATE the new layout. Daily forecasts are on a wavy kind of bar graph. Sometimes the forecasts don’t match the same day ones.

Had a tornado warning and looked to the radar and nothing on the radar even though it was torrential downpours and wind. Same thing happened during Hurricane Florence. No radar info. The free iPhone app is easier to maneuver than this crap!! You guys are so like all media nowadays, it’s all about the ads and how much you can charge. Not honest news and weather! I’m sure I can get a video of a cat doing something stupid though. Fix this!!!"
2503,CrystalFan2,"October 2, 2018",1,"Horrible after update I Deleted the day after the latest update. You cannot read anything because the print is so fine and small, which requires you to blink repeatedly because of the white background.  I absolutely hate the graph to show the temperature. We want to be able to open the app, glance at it and read exactly what we need to know for the day’s forecast or the week. We don’t want to have to get glasses, not decipher a wavy line to see the temps!  Change it back or I’ll find something else!"

You could then touch each day to get more info. Also, I agree with the other reviews I don’t care to see videos of weather. I go to this app for a quick check of today’s weather and also what the next few days look like. This new version is clumsy to navigate. I don’t like the graph version of the day either. Please go back to the old format!!!"

It also hasn’t been working the past 4 days. The app opens but everything is just white and doesn’t show anything.  It is very difficult to see the next week worth of weather, it looks like it is hourly weather instead of 5 days.  It is 1/5 stars until they update the app and make it.... a user friendly weather app....."

Every 5 minutes, the forecast (winter in this case) changes from 1-3 inches of snow to Winter Storm Warning with 5-8 inches...then, in literally seconds, you swipe down to refresh and there’s not even a Winter Weather Advisory and maybe 1 inch of snow in the forecast. Wait 5 minutes, repeat and something totally different appears...AGAIN! "

The new look is painful and nearly unreadable.  It is lacking in colorful visual graphics.  The type is too small all around, tiny really.  I’m so disappointed.  In general there is less of a quick and easy to grasp view of information.  It takes too long to find what I want.  Put back the scrolling screen of hour by hour with larger graphics and color background please!!"
2508,kasboston,"November 20, 2018",2,New UI is not intuitive I always relied on the weather channel app but now I find it frustrating. I do not like the widget across the top to switch to daily/weekly/hourly views. Unless I click into the day it doesn’t give me an accurate picture. Looking at the daily view now I see 10%...I assumed it was % of showers. But it’s actively raining and clicking in to the detail shows me a more accurate 90%. And what is the blue wavy line? No idea... I think in an effort to get a cleaner UI it lost value.
2509,Speedyite,"December 9, 2018",1,"Just doesn’t work On iPhone X, latest IOS download and install-it opens and appears to run fine-ONCE. If you swipe up the app and try to start it again the progress wheel spins for ten seconds the it fails to load and suddenly you’re back on the home screen. You can get to restart one of two ways: force restart the phone or delete the app and reload. But again, if you try to restart it it returns to home page. Quite useless. And I was stupid enough to buy out of ads for four bucks!"
2510,LuckyIrishB,"September 6, 2018",1,"Latest Update a downgrade I really liked this app when i 1st got it but since they updated it to a “fresh look” the colors are awful, it’s difficult to see all the information I’m lookin for, its hard to read with the color choices they have switched to and the graphics for the radar etc. seem to have gotten worse somehow. Very disappointed with the update and hope they go back to the original look and feel. That way i can see all the info in one place clearly and easily."
2511,LostIn PA,"September 7, 2018",1,"Worst “Upgrade” Ever While I recognize that no one likes change, we eventually get used to the changes and quite like them. This is not one of those times. The interface is messy, not well organized and cumbersome. I’m getting ads when I’m a paid subscriber to avoid ads. Maybe the worst is it keeps crashing. Guess I’m looking for a different weather app. Shame. It was a decent app until this “upgrade”. I just downloaded a different app...I see where this app was trying to go but it failed miserably."
2512,Countrymomr325,"September 9, 2018",1,New update is a mess The recent update has pushed me to choose to delete the app. For starters the amount of ads you have had become so overwhelming. I want the forecast not 3-5 minutes of ads and videos. Second not all updates are helpful. This one has basically hidden the long term forecast (anything longer than 12 hours) and I feel like I’m stumbling to find it every time I open the app. Sorry guys. Time to tweak the app a bit more and maybe I’ll come back. WeatherBug is my new go to for the forecast.

2514,cycle through,"September 10, 2018",2,"Reimagined Version The reimagined app is VERY slow to open and difficult to read. Why someone would use a light color font on a white background is baffling. Trying to quickly differentiate between day and night on the home screen, daily tab is comical. Perhaps different color fonts could better identify day from night. The useless graph line adds an additional layer of confusion. The app does provide a wealth of info but fails for those needing a quick glance."

I lovvvve the weather channel and looked at their app first thing every single morning for as long as smart phones have been around...the new update is awful.

2517,Cookie Monster2u,"September 21, 2018",3,"Hard to read I liked the way the Weather Channel app was before the last makeover. It is now very hard to read, hard to see what the weekly weather will be without having to scroll, the font is barely visible for the older eyes, and hard to navigate around the site.  The week at a glance was very helpful before. Please make a few changes to make it great again."
2518,Oral reader,"September 25, 2018",1,Hate the new app I think the changes are difficult to use and I find it is not accurate much of the time.  The hourly listings are very inaccurate as the times don't seem to follow the clock. It does not show the current location automatically as it is set to do and cannot find home or work requests. I've tried for long enough and have to depend on other accurate apps.  The font size on the new app is very difficult to read making this app which used to be one of my favorites unusable.
2519,Slippen 'n Slidin,"September 26, 2018",5,Weather watching One of my favorite things is to follow the weather. I have loved following hurricanes in Fla. as a child and Nor’easters in New England as a grownup. It is also very interesting in NC as an old lady. The weather is fascinating because of the changes. We called it “wait a minute weather” in NE and I think we have that in N C as well. 😀 Slippen ‘n Sliden

2521,S1eleven,"August 16, 2018",2,"Ads play; not accurate Biggest irritation from this app is that ads start playing audio. The first few times I had no idea where is was coming from because I couldn’t find the ad, it’s just audio. Since I have to use weather info at my job a lot I find it unprofessional when my phone starts making noises in front of customers. I deleted the app because there are other, more accurate, weather apps out there any way."
2522,TrapShooterDave,"August 22, 2018",5,Great I really couldn’t live without the Weather Channel App.  It tells me everything about the weather where I am and where I’m going.  This is especially useful here in Florida where pop up storms are regular in the summer.  It may not be raining at home but 3 miles away at the club there may be a deluge.  Great App.
2523,Pewpewmctoweryness,"August 29, 2018",5,Very usable and intuitive This update makes the weather channel app the best one on the market hands-down. There is more info with a single glance or swipe than any of the others. Great job. I bet this will be the standard layout for weather apps in a few years.
2524,rms2424,"August 30, 2018",5,Enjoying this app. I enjoy this app. We live in the boonies & most of the weather has pasted us before we get an announcement from the weather channel. I now know when to either feed my animals or take shelter with them. I especially enjoy the maps. Please don’t take those us.
2525,Tom NE Ohio,"August 30, 2018",1,Terrible update. Sometimes you should not fix what is not broken. This is change just to change. The previous version was far more fluid than the new update. Having most everything on one page was very convenient. With this update you now have to jump around to find information in a format not at all pleasing to the eye. This does not have the feel the weather channel has on tv. Time would have been better spent improving the functions on the old model.
2526,Qwertygirl35,"August 31, 2018",1,"WHY take away ease of use?!?! GOOD GRIEF, WHYYYYYYY would you sacrifice ease of use for flashy-ness? This new update TOOK AWAY immediate views of a 7-day forecast, daily percentage of chance of rain, and in general forces the user to swipe and scroll and click MUCH MORE. App. also takes forever to open now.  I’m disappointed. Also, it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to switch cities."
2527,TigerLily48433,"August 31, 2018",2,"Reimagined app too bright I was dismayed at your reimagined app when I went to check the weather forecast this morning. The background is too bright and the font is too thin. The previous dark background & light colored font was perfect for reading first thing in the morning. Scrolling across the screen instead of down is less pleasing to the eye, too. You had a great design before. Why the drastic & less appealing changes? Time for me to find a new weather app."
2528,Mountain Lady 219,"September 2, 2018",1,"The new version I really am not liking the new version very much. It has a very boring, Machine - like look.

Then I was forced to upgrade to the lastest version and it’s horrible. The app is clutered, slow (on and Iphone 6S Plus), freezes once in a while and takes time to update. The screen is filled with videos and articles that requires so much more scrolling to get to the useful stuff. The native iPhone weather app is now much better."

Too many bean counters running this company these days , not enough brains. Get with the program."

I’m not sure when you changed it but it recently updated on my phone and now looks like your website - it’s extremely difficult to navigate and looking at other locations is way more difficult than before. I used to avoid your website and use the app instead but now they are both horrible. I’m going back to Apple weather

My 2 year old is better at forecasting weather than this app, I told my wife I should go buy a weather rock!, it would be 100% more accurate than this garbage app. For a weather app they hide the maps and forecasts so you inadvertently click on ads so they make money!

I would like to see the humidity added to the daily and hourly views though.  When you are on the website it shows it and on an iPad there should be enough screen space.  Overall I’m happy with the app.
2539,eXoticButterz,"June 2, 2018",1,"Nope It would be great, if my location would be accurate, and the current weather situations. Why would it tell me that it’s raining, when the sun is out, and it’s in the mid 90s? I guess you meteorologists have the greatest job because you can be wrong about the weather 90% of the time, and still get paid for it. I get it, you can’t 100% predict the weather, neither can your inaccurate machines and radars, but, could you try a little harder? "

More than once during big storms the radar has me in the center of some nasty weather only for it to be sunny at my location. Then they decided to come up with premium. Why would I pay for something with the radar isn’t accurate? I’m deleting not because of the inaccuracies but because of the POP UPS wanting me to upgrade every single time I open the application!

But now that I get assaulted with the nag screen to purchase premium every time I open the app, there is zero chance that will happen. I’m now aware that premium exists, but since I have to go through an extra step just to see what the temperature is, the app has lost all usefulness.

But other than that it’s a really good app to have.

2562,KLynne06,"May 26, 2019",5,"Most accurate weather app This has been the closest app for accuracy for the weather. I check it everyday. There's only been a few times that it was completely off. Otherwise, it is nicely detailed and easy to navigate."
2563,KateCarly,"June 1, 2019",1,"Literally the worst The 1 Star is for the radar (when it actually works). The app frequently crashes, the user interface is designed so poorly. Not intuitive. No hierarchy. No clarity. Way too much going on with all the ads & videos in between. It’s like a Snapchat Discover feed but worse. For “The Weather Channel” and IBM, it shocks me that the app is this poorly developed and designed - especially when hundreds of thousands of people need reliable weather updates to keep themselves safe."
2564,StillSlipery,"June 8, 2019",1,"Hasn’t worked reliably since IBM took over This app hasn’t worked reliably since (it seems) IBM took over. It used to be my go-to app for weather and weather risk notifications but because of reliably issues (app hangs, doesn’t launch, doesn’t update, never get notifications, support doesn’t reply or seem to care) I’ve had to remove it and use something else. Also found out that when it does work the other apps report more accurate conditions and predictions, so I guess it’s a good thing."
2565,7 22 58,"September 9, 2019",5,Weather channel review It’s so much more then a  weather app it gives you lots of great information on what’s going on At your hometown .as you travel so does the weather app Giving you fast accurate up-to-date information thanks weather channel you guys rock
2566,Stp107,"July 23, 2019",5,"My “Go To” App for the weather! I’ve tried a lot of different apps, including the one that came on my iPhone. None of them come close to the Weather Channel App. I use it every day to check my local weather, and it’s great for travel to see what kind of weather I’m heading into."
2567,dummie phone,"July 21, 2019",1,"No more I have used this app for a few years now. Some versions good some not so good. But it now looks like weather underground, I will keep the older version on my iPad until I have to change. Now to find something to replace this on my iPhone."
2568,RSNCTS,"July 16, 2019",1,"Missed the mark I never review websites but I have to say that to be the go-to weather source in the US you’re app is complete junk.   Full signal, strong WiFi connection, doesn’t matter.  You’re too consumed with advertising your shows and creating news that you forgot the most important thing - the actual weather.   Your past and future radar simply doesn’t work.   Your forecasts are not updated like I would think they should be.  I am uninstalling and going with another app.  Goodbye"
2569,Ranbynj,"June 10, 2019",4,"Great App Besides 1 Thing I love this app it works great, the only problem is it doesn’t accurately predict the weather. I love scheduling my day based on this apps predictions cause it’s always wrong, the predictions are always backwards. Usually if it says rain i plan my day around doing outdoor activities cause i know it will be clear skies all day. Thank you weather channel and God bless america."
2570,I/love,"October 11, 2018",5,"IphoneX I am impressed ... i keep coming back to this app and eliminating others because updates include all the info individual apps run with , but its all in one... professional effort and team... i get all i need now with additions of Air quality  .. health risk etc.. all the extras... thanks .. keep up the good work ..👌🏼"
2571,kidbonita,"November 4, 2018",2,"Update hard to read The newest update is very difficult to read. Light colors on a pale background, very small text. I thought I would love the upgrade when I saw the preview, but alas am quite disappointed. Hopefully this will be remedied soon."
2572,Saltys01569,"November 25, 2018",2,Weather accurate but hate new app Nothing but problems since the app was updated to the new format. Getting ready to delete and move on. iPhone 7plus and it crashes constantly when you try to open the app. Disappointed. If you keep clicking to open the app eventually it opens and works but who wants to sit there and keep opening the app. 
2573,dianewlake,"December 26, 2018",1,"Updated app is awful found Weather Bug Absolutely hate the updated weather ap. The daily forecast view is difficult to read and there is no longer an easy to read summary. Thanks to other reviews of The Weather Channel ap I discovered Weather Bug. It is customizable, easy to read and similar to the old Weather Channel ap. If Weather Channel wants to stop the mass exit of users they need to make changes fast. Thank you Weather Bug for being a better alternative."
2574,Eyrate,"January 26, 2019",1,"Change = yuck I have the new version on my iPad and I do not like it. So far I have been able to avoid accidentally updating the app on my iPhone. I am very happy with the old iPhone app. But I don’t want the new one because it looks boring, has graphs which I do not need or want. So many reviewer‘s are asking you to bring the old version back. I am adding my request to that long growing list. It seemed perfect. The app on my iPhone is my go-to weather app. Until the day it quits working or I accidentally hit the update button."
2575,HamburgerBreak,"January 28, 2019",1,"Weathers or Not? Not! Months ago the Weather Channel removed its great app and replaced it with graphs and pictures. We want to see the weather forecast, not a high school science project. Worse yet, the latest update broke the app altogether. It often won’t load on my ipad(using ios12.2),it freezes. And when it does load, the forecast (temp etc) won’t update when you go back later in the day unless you close out the app with the home button/swipe up. If you must use this app, don’t run the latest update!"
2576,Bible Reader 7,"January 29, 2019",1,Missed the mark - again I don’t write reviews often but feel compelled to share my thoughts on this one. A truly terrible app with little functionality. Rarely does it perform correctly. When it opens / the data is very visually overloading. I find myself resorting back to the native iPhone weather app for stability. Please bring back the original app and leave behind the excessive hype that the tv station thrives on. I’m looking for basic weather data without the marketing garbage usually found in other apps.
2577,lower 'bama granny,"February 7, 2019",2,"Disappointed I TOTALLY agree with Dia2 concerning the definite decline in quality now given on this app !! Used to be a good & reliable app, especially for changing weather conditions, storms with great & accurate alert info. Not anymore. This app no longer updates ANY weather I have starred (favorites) unless I go out of that locale currently shown & then back into it. Used to do this as soon as you went onto the app. Sorely missing original Weather Channel app it used to be. sigh 😔"
2578,Tdodson09,"February 18, 2019",1,Alerts not working! So disappointed with the new upgrade. My alerts do not work for my location. I get alerts for other locations that I have saved but not my own. I have deleted the app and reinstalled but still no luck!!  It worked perfectly before the new update. I have reached out to customer support but no response or resolution! I will have no other choice but to delete this app and look for another one!!  Why would I want a weather app that can’t keep me alerted to significant weather!!
2579,breachplug,"February 22, 2019",4,Not satisfied Provided accurate reports; difficult to traverse screens.  Slow to open up initially and between screens.  I contribute slow response time to advertising; same ad repeatedly shows even after continuously indicating my lack interest.  I want report immediately on opening app; will look to other app!
2580,cycle through,"September 9, 2018",2,"Reimagined App The reimagined app is VERY slow to open and difficult to read. Why someone would use a light color font on a white background is baffling. Trying to quickly differentiate between day and night on the home screen, daily tab is comical. Perhaps a different color font could better identify day from night. The useless graph line adds an additional layer of confusion. The app does provide a wealth of info but it fails for those needing a quick glance."
2581,Heathersprk,"September 9, 2018",3,"Was okay I always liked this app because it was simple, as accurate as any other, and offered a forecast 15 whole days out. But the latest update has made it unusable. You can’t see the week ahead at a glance anymore. The simplicity is gone... the layout is complicated and not user friendly. Plus worst of all, it freezes up and crashes constantly now."
2582,ProApplicationReviews,"September 10, 2018",1,Zero stars post update The new update while shiny is a real bother and removes the ease of seeing the information you care about behind new slide tabs that don’t need to be instead of a scrolling page.  Very buggy too and when once there were few to no load times it now takes ages to display important information.  
2583,Thstltfjyt,"September 10, 2018",2,Hate the update Are use this app primarily for the easy access to the radar. It just took me over a minute to scroll through all of the things popping out at me to find the radar way down below I’ll be other information. It’s not user-friendly. It’s not easy to see. I want to give this a quick glance not spend an hour or an through all the information. Whoever came up with this update really needs to rethink it
2584,Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaa,"September 11, 2018",1,"New update is a downgrade New update is terrible.. not because it is a new layout - I can learn a new layout - even though the last version was just fine. The new version is full of useless information and graphs.. and It’s hard to tell what’s an ad and what is pertinent information.  Also, the weather advisory alerts are have disappeared. I get a notification for a severe storm in my area, click on it, and it takes me to the home page with no info on the storm warning. This update is hot garbage."
2585,Jlowe0608,"September 12, 2018",3,New app version I am not a fan of the current app software. The 15 day forecast is too busy with the line that goes up and down. The app seems to be focused on videos and tiles. The tiles seem great as you scroll though but also too busy. The same can be said for the day and hour updates. Less is more keep it simple. Otherwise I have enjoyed the app in all the previous versions.
2586,aspenakita,"September 13, 2018",1,Update stinks! For many years I have loved the weather channel app. It was the only place I went for accurate weather predictions and reporting. Unfortunately the most recent update has led me to look for a different weather app. The update is not user friendly. The graphs are poor and the lines used through the week are a distraction from the weather predictions. I am disappointed with the update & would like the administrators of the app to consider going back to the old format.
2587,bonds006,"September 18, 2018",1,DON'T FIX IT IF IT'S NOT BROKEN! I completely agree with Lt Williams and his assessment of the app... TOO MANY ADVERTISEMENTS AND IRRELEVANT CLICKBAIT VIDEOS. just stick to WEATHER and NO POLITICS or AGENDAS other than weather. I do not care about your climate change agenda. 
2588,ganniac,"September 24, 2018",5,"Goodbye weather channel I have used the Weather Channel for years but I absolutely hated the update, hate the format of it. Just give me today’s weather and forecast including temperature and humidity, maybe ten day overview, skip all the videos and ads. I have since moved to the app ‘AccuWeather’ and I love it."
2589,weather32,"September 27, 2018",3,"Terrible re-design The new update for the app is terrible! It is not as easy to navigate as it was before and the today, hourly, and daily information is a lot more difficult to look at quickly. I liked the previous version of the app, and from what I’m hearing, a lot of people agree.  I hope they make an update that brings back the look of the previous version."
2590,Neily911,"June 2, 2018",4,"Bring back swipe to different city After the last two updates, you can no longer swipe to change locations. This is super annoying and was a great feature before. Bring back swipe to different city and I would give 5 stars. Love the detailed info and radar maps."
2591,Yours totally,"July 1, 2018",1,Robert Stewart Don’t like it at all
2592,Happy face 😀😀😀😀,"July 5, 2018",1,Useless app This app is useless. I can't rely on it for anything. Forecasts change constantly. Take today—this morning it said thunderstorms today developing in the afternoon. A storm came through at 10 am for about 20 minutes. An hour later the app said sunny all day and nearly no chance of rain. Then storms came through and severe thunderstorm warnings were out for the metro. This is in a large city. The app seems to try too hard to be accurate and changes constantly. I’m no longer going to use it.
2593,Iceman1953,"August 28, 2018",5,#1 Weather Source You are my #1 source for up to date storm and weather information...... and you do it so well ! I look forward to hearing your daily reports each morning .  You and my morning coffee are a great way to start my day ! Thanks for doing such a professional job !
2594,Ojoyous1,"August 29, 2018",2,Horrible update. Deleting the app. The new update is horrible. I will be deleting it and getting another weather app. I used to be able to see everything quickly and easily especially the forecast two weeks out which I require because I travel constantly. Too much clicking & scrolling. Also I now cannot easily see anything on the white background and with smaller print. Awful update deleting your app.
2595,Devibuddi,"September 1, 2018",5,"Disappointing I’ve had this app for a long time and used to love it. The new changes are really awful. The white background,tiny light colored numbers and letters make it difficult to read and the navigation is terrible. Definitely not changes for the better."
2596,Old Vicki,"September 3, 2018",3,"new screen I thought I would like the new format better and on an IPad it’s great.  On an IPhone not so much.  It’s just too much info for such a small screen.  I don’t know what I’d move to a different screen, but it’s too much info jammed onto the first screen.  you’re still my favorite weather app but you need to reduce the amount of info on the first screen or possibly rearrange it so it’s less “in your face”."
2597,R-Dog14,"September 5, 2018",1,"Update is Horrible All I want to know if the 15 day (really only care about 5-7 days) forecast and it’s no longer there in a readable format. First it’s super hard to find, and then instead of being a thick bar graph like all weather forecasts are, it’s a thin curved line graph. So difficult to read and when you finally interpret it you have wished you just used another app cause you are questioning what you actually just read for each day. Horrible, horrible update. I will be searching for a new weather app now."
2598,Chiggerbutt,"September 8, 2018",2,Why mess with success? This newest update is just dreadful. The older versions made it easy to see weather at a glance while this requires more digging to find what you what. The white background is just too stark and the radar is just flat wrong. It can be raining where I am and the radar will briefly show precipitation until I hit play and then it just disappears. Used to love this app but I’m using others until this gets a revamp from the revamp. Very disappointing.
2599,Wcm321,"September 8, 2018",1,Hate it. New app redesign is the worst ever. Thanks for making me deleting the app from all my devices and going back to the standard Apple weather app. Now all I need is to find a way to get radar info. Stay away from the weather channel app
2600,MrsTom59,"January 24, 2018",5,Weather App I use this app daily. I like being able to see the weather where everyone in my family lives. The videos are interesting to watch. I like the Doppler radar as well. I do a lot of walking so it’s helpful to know when the rain is coming!
2601,Lllgfjllhgf,"March 7, 2018",5,"Can’t sign up Receiving an error message when I try to sign up. Also I’m unable to turn the severe weather feature, pollen, etc on. It tells me to click locations but locations in not clickable. I have locations on “always allow” for this app. iPhone X iOS 11.2.6."
2602,MeMaMo2012,"March 11, 2018",4,"Good, but flawed The app is generally good, I like being able to see 48 hours and 15 days in advance and check the radar, but there’s one major problem. When I’m in Morocco, it finds the city I’m in no problem, but I can’t search for other cities in Morocco. I don’t know why, but it’s very inconvenient and I have to download a different app instead."
2603,Angels's grandpa,"May 17, 2018",2,"Bring back the old app, this is no upgrade. This update that I was forced to use was a waste of development $.  The new app requires more strokes to do anything and shows less information on a screen.  I can’t find the current U.V. index anywhere, something you need to pay attention to in S. Florida. The app stores multiple locations, but they are on screens that have to be selected, not swiped into.  If there is any improvement in this version, I can’t find it."
2604,Wolfnamedleah,"May 24, 2018",3,"Was working now I can’t open After the newest update. My app doesn’t want to open. I get the weather channel background and the wheel that tells me that it’s loading. However it’s not loading, it just keeps going around and then my phone finally gives up and goes to sleep after 3 min. I do love this app. Just wish I knew what you did so i can get my weather again."
2605,intoclay,"May 31, 2018",3,"Want the features I relied on in the old app I was forced to “upgrade” to the new version of the app for my iPad...well in “upgrading” I lost key functionality: hourly humidity (84 and 30% humidity feels WAY different than 80% humidity) and I can no longer plug in dates/locations I will be traveling to easily plan my packing/trip. Both features I used regularly if not daily. Two thumbs down, not an “upgrade” a bate and switch."
2606,Jkarpitskiy,"March 14, 2020",4,"NO TO PREMIUM Super annoyed that this app loves to push people to upgrade to premium when you just open the app. Some of us don’t need it and don’t mind the ads when using the app and enjoy the basics. Any time I open the app it advertises the upgrade to premium version. I DON’T NEED TO BE A METEOROLOGIST. It’s fine to keep the upgrade option but don’t do it every time I open the app, please."
2607,Pepe'44,"February 25, 2020",4,"New weather channel I had the weather channel which disappeared on my old iPod which I liked better. Had to buy a new iPod 12, I was told, my old was a 10.

2609,jststl,"January 20, 2020",2,"Keeps Crashing, No Support I have the paid version and a few weeks ago, it started crashing when I tried to check the hourly forecast.  Two messages to customer support and I have gotten an auto reply saying they’ll get back to me, which doesn’t happen. Finally reported to Apple Store and almost immediately got a reply about an update that resolved the problem.  Terrible customer service through the app."
2610,luke jdjdnsjjsjs 1991,"January 12, 2020",2,"Great app, until premium happened I’ve had this app for a long time. Loved it. Now they introduced “premium” and obnoxiously saturated everything with ads and pop ups to upgrade that seriously impact user navigation and experience, and also removed features that are now available to premium only. I’m expected now to pay more for the same product I’ve had for years, that is actually now a worse experience."

2612,Luwanna1305,"January 7, 2020",1,Don’t waste your time The Weather Channel app sold out completely. There are so many ads interfering with the use of the app that I finally deleted it.  I used to use it exclusively a year ago. They changed the format and kept slowly adding more and more ads. Now the 15 day forecast has an ad in between each day!  The banner ads at the bottom were bad enough but that crap was the last straw. I’ll be using any other app but not The we’re greedy for every penny we can get Weather Channel app.
2613,Laura MW,"January 6, 2020",1,"Letting Go So, after many years with the WC, I’ve finally deleted it from my phone. Between the constant ads & videos, the app has become useless & very difficult to navigate. My other issue, is constantly being asked to upgrade to a premium version. I already pay a TV provider a large sum of money monthly which includes the WC & I just can’t justify an additional payment. So, until these issues are resolved or worked out, I’ll find another source for my weather."
2614,CoolGpa,"January 4, 2020",2,"Out of control advertisements I really like the accuracy of the weather information that this app provides, however the latest release has gone completely crazy with advertisements. Of course the pro version has in-realistic pricing. If the pro version was properly priced I would buy it. Subscription/annual pricing is just plain wrong. An app should be able to be Bought, until a substantial update comes along."
2615,ShariB1130,"December 30, 2019",3,Not impressed with new update. Not impressed with the changes.  They say it is more info in a compact form. More info is true. How useful is still a question. somewhere it states that videos are still available but after two days of looking I still can find them. Can’t even go back and find the information that said they were still there.
2616,Speedygirl9,"December 30, 2019",2,"What happened The weather channel app use to work wonderfully! However, ever since the new update about the change in privacy the app has become unusable. Every time I open the app it directly pops up requesting me to turn on my location services (I have never allowed it from the very beginning). Additionally, when I surpass that request it stays on the load page and never actually gives me my weather anymore."
2617,Grumblyinmytumbly,"December 28, 2019",1,"NOT “working to improve” I’ve used this app for years and it has increasingly gone downhill with each update. Now the time of weather events is missing from the radar screen. How does that warn us of impending dangers?? The Weather Chnl app is not working to improve their service or their app! Lies!!!! I’m returning to my local Nashville chnl 4 weather app. It times the weather events. Accuweather gives me the moon phases, & WeatherBug gives me the lightning strikes in my area.

The sunshine/rain/snow/windy pictures are too far below the temperatures for the day.  The daily weekly forecast with the curvature lines I’m not digging so much. It just seems to separated for top to bottom on each day.

2620,123456789anoano,"April 23, 2019",1,Best job in the world I’m glad weather men/people who put the weather on this app are not mechanics or of any important job for that matter. I have a lawn mowing business that relies on good weather obviously. I use several weathers apps not including this one anymore. I have made informed decisions based upon these apps and I can honestly say this is usually wrong. However let’s not forget the fact it will send you an alert 10 mins before it’s about to happen. Really does not help to plan things out that’s for sure.

2622,tomd23,"June 9, 2019",2,Bad radar I used to like this app but as I used it more I discovered how inaccurate the radar is. I like the fact that it go a few hours past the current time but it gives false information. Many times the radar says it’s not raining when I’m having bad thunderstorms or it says it’s raining when its not. The radar is very important to me. I like to see what’s happening and for how long. I guess it’s time to find a more accurate weather app
2623,remBevin42,"November 7, 2019",3,"Slow and crashy since year 1 I’ve used this app forever, with several others to fall back to, and its the same pattern: a version (or interface style) is released, it crashes or mis-renders, or WON’T render, or is molasses.

When you go back into the app it is frozen and eventually crashes and has to be restarted. This is on an iPhone 8 Plus with updates IOS as well as on my wife’s iPhone. If you check the weather and set your phone down for a minute be prepared to start from scratch. The app is becoming unstable and unusable.

It was much better in the older simple format. I hate using it now. I’ve been trying out different apps for a few days... Goodbye, Weather Channel."

The radar display of what’s happening now and what’s in sync don’t mix (ie it’s raining right now and the current radar shows it is going to get more intense, however when I click on the progression it shows the rain not near me at all). Not to mention multiple days I’ve gotten caught in the rain when there’s been no mention of anything whatsoever on the app. It’s not very accurate or reliable."

The update has me looking at other apps."

2657,MB6251971,"September 21, 2018",1,Update is terrible The latest update ruined this app. I hate the new format and the radar rarely works.  It will show activity one minute and then it is blank like there is no rain in the area when there actually is.  I’ve had the weather channel app for as long as I have had an iPhone but I am now looking for an alternative.  I liked the old format where I could easily see the forecast by day and hour.  Did I say I hate the new layout?  I hate it so bad this is the first time I’ve done a review on any app.
2658,melly2288,"September 22, 2018",3,"What happened to simplicity? I used to love this app. Ever since the updates the forecasts have become confusing to read and navigating is frustrating. I’m on my twenties, so I’m not an older person who would typically post a complaint like this. However, I’m disappointed in the new layout and frustrated that the app I once appreciated and checked constantly now looks messy and confusing."
2659,HarrietJonesMP,"September 27, 2018",3,"New format isn’t great I’ve had this app for a while and loved it. I just upgraded my phone, which downloaded the new format. I know it’s meant to be more user friendly and specific about whether it will rain am or pm, as well as highs and lows. The result, however, is really busy and a little hard to read. I do like that everything I need is right at the top though. That’s an improvement."
2660,Rjw50312,"June 6, 2018",3,Good in the beginning The ads and videos load before the actual weather. With the name I would think this would be the best app. The forecast is never accurate past a couple days. I realize weather rarely is but this will and has predicted snow and 29 when the day arrives it’s like really warm and sunny. The radar is the last thing to load. I have 5g wireless with really fast connections.
2661,Ludlow2,"June 7, 2018",2,"Less useful, less intuitive Previous version worked well and was easy to use.  The newer version is, of course, “fatter” with unnecessary features and jerks rather than smoothly scrolls. I normally check the weather for more than one location.  The previous version allowed me to swipe right or left to view another location. Now, I have to go to the search icon and tap on the other city to change locations."
2662,Welsbacher,"June 17, 2018",1,"Terrible Not only has this app gotten worse since they completely upgraded and changed it, you can’t plan anything because they never get the weather right. Father’s Day was suppose to be a rainy day from 1pm until the following day. Not only was our day ruined due to the hourly forecast, when it finally did rain, it was only a down pour for less than five minutes... I kind you not."

It’s like “The Boy Who Cried Wolf”. If the reason for the notification passes, the notification should disappear. Alternatively, you could leave the notification but mark it expired. That way I would at least know why the dot appeared."
2665,LPFEDecker,"August 30, 2018",1,"Please bring back the old app I love the weather channel app and I can appreciate the hard work on the new app BUT it’s harder to read. The old blue background was much more practical and easier to read than the new white background. The highs and lows temperature waves are nice but it’s hard to distinguish between the days with the light gray colors, there’s no defining like between the days of the week. "
2666,andyokie,"August 30, 2018",2,"Some things need to be left in an “at a glance” format I really, really dislike the way daily weather is formatted. In the past you could quickly see 15 day’s of projections on one easy to compare page. This new format means one cannot easily see projections for two weeks side by side. When planning for travel the old format was exceedingly more useful. I’m going to be looking for another weather app because if this change."

I have to squint to see the numbers, I have to search for the weekly outlook and it’s a little difficult to tell the days apart!! Please change it back to the dark color contrast. The 3 main things people want to see quickly when they log on is 1. Today’s weather 2. The weekly outlook and 3. The air quality/allergens. Make it simple and straight to the point. Put the videos at the bottom! We have news for that."
2668,The AWarner,"September 1, 2018",1,"I don’t think you could make it more confusing! The new version 10 app is seriously confusing.  Side scrolling sine wave charts for temperature?  Really?  I’m hoping that someone will wake up and say “You know, this was actually better before we changed it”.  Also, being able to swipe left to right to get to different saved cities was another great feature you decided to remove a while back.  Change for the sake of change isn’t always a good thing.  It isn’t here for sure."
2669,Brooksmusic,"September 2, 2018",1,"It’s now nonfunctional I use this app all the time but since the new design it’s basically nonfunctional. I’m getting alerts that there is a severe thunderstorm alert and it takes SO LONG TO LOAD if it even does that I can’t even check to see if Sim In harms way. I’ve rebooted, turned off and on, deleted and reinstalled but nothing makes it work anymore. It’s been happening ever since the update. I even paid to have ads disabled. It works on IPad with old version but not in iPhone with new version. So frustrating."

That app made it quick and easy to see current conditions, then flip over to the forecast.  And it made it easy to quickly look at multiple locations.  This app, by comparison, is cluttered and requires a lot of scrolling and is just ugly to look at.   Giving you two stars because the data is still good.  But the design is terrible."
2672,Surgical_One,"March 29, 2018",1,"What happened? I’ve used this app for years. It used to be quick and smooth. Over the last year the app has become so slow it’s unusable. There is multiple second delays on scrolling and clicking. Videos are hit or miss if they work or just fail to load. Not sure if this is an attempt to push toward a paid app version but unfortunately I’ll be acquiring a new weather app. What a let down, hopefully TWC can get back to where they were years ago and I’ll download again."
2673,derryhumma,"April 7, 2018",1,"Hate this version I loved the earlier version.  I used it for years.  Simple. Straight forward. Flexible.  I could check 4-5 cities forecast in under a minute, important when you are in an area where weather can vary & temps differ 20+ degrees in under 40 miles.  High, low, precipitation - for today or the next 5-10 days.  A quick glance told me everything I needed 99% of the time, and I could get more detail if needed.  I find myself hunting for what I need now.  I absolutely hate this app now and will be looking elsewhere."
2674,iNtheMiX66,"April 22, 2018",3,"App is good but... sometimes 🤔 I prefer this app over the Weather app on the phone. It offers plenty of info with hourly, day and week. My only beef with it is that whenever I open the app I end up getting alerts for whatever city I have saved or happen to be in. That’s great if I actually enabled those alerts. So, now I constantly have to go to the settings and disable all Alerts. Everyday. Not cool."
2675,scharaa,"April 26, 2018",1,"Breaking news alert I turned off all alerts, including breaking news, and kept significant weather on. I continued to receive “breaking news” alerts. I checked the FAQ, said to turn off push notifications. I didn’t want to turn off push bc I want the significant weather notifications. I turned off breaking news again. Left the app. Went back in. And the breaking news notifications were enabled again! Happened 5 times. Disabled my account and deleted the app. Super shady."

However, recently (within a month prior to this review) the in-app advertising and premium nag screens has made the app useless. I get that companies want to make money, but trying to frustrate users into “upgrading” to a premium edition with worthless additional features is wrong. I am giving up and trying another weather app and if that doesn’t work I’ll just have to go back to using NOAA’s website."

As a bike commuter it has been very helpful to stay on top of current weather conditions.  However, for the past few months I have been getting more invasive ads and pop up ads while using the apps.  I have to cancel the “buy premium” ad when I launch the apps. Now I have been getting full screen pop up ads switching between views.  Time to find another weather app."
2682,ks tax payer,"February 4, 2020",2,"Not a good update Not near as useful. I used the app a great deal before.  It will now only let you add weather for 5 places instead of ten.  I used to use it for trip planning.  Switching to weather bug I guess.  It is too spread out on the page with lots of useless information.  Sometimes, less is more.  Mine suddenly quit working and I reinstalled thinking it would be the old app.  Nope.  It is a horrible upgrade.  No way I would upgrade to premium."

Now you are required to go into several locations for one type of information and then go into another. Will try to find something that is similar to what I had before. I am 77 years old and this is horrible to try and navigate.
2684,Jineyb,"January 27, 2020",1,Wish the older version still worked The new version does not give the humidity or “feels like” on the hourly info just once on weather now.  I liked some things about the newer version but kept using the old for some information.  Now it no longer works.  New version really lacks detail.  I don't just want to know the humidity and “real feel” now I want to know it for the next 24 hours.  I can step outside to see what it feels like now. Using accuweather to get the additional info I need.

I’m done w the app til this is corrected."
2715,belwig,"February 18, 2019",3,Badge icon blues The most annoying thing about this app is that the badge icon number has zero indication of what it’s for inside the app itself. If you miss or don’t look for the notification then you have no clue why that red number is there. Why not add SOMETHING in the app itself that relays the same info as the notifications? I use the app regularly so it works well but this my only real gripe.

I have been using the ad free version of the weather channel App (yes I am that sucker that paid) for years and the new updates have gone from bad to worse. Newest update has caused the app to rarely ever open without choking for at least 30-60 seconds and up to three minutes first. Super frustrating. I should just go back to listening to AM radio. **UPDATE** new update same loading issue. Meanwhile AM radio is still solid.

As far as being able to see temp on my homepage without opening the app itself. You are supposed to be able to hold down on the app and it show you the weather. It does it’s just not always correct.  And I do wish y’all would stop changing things.

The new look is better than the old but this thing is a hot mess. The allergen information (very important to me) says literally 3 different things. It has 3 different areas that are supposed to say the same thing but they all say different things... how is that possible? This app is insanely unorganized and CLOGGED with so much garbage. I’m finally going to do myself a favor and find a weather app that actually makes sense.
2722,PA 0901,"September 15, 2018",1,"New update issues. I have had this app for years. I may be the only person to care, but I pay attention to the uv index. Yes I check it hourly during outdoor activities. Though the app is now more streamlined, they have cut this feature out of the app. That feature was initially the only reason that I downloaded the app and will now be deleting it from my library. If I wanted the same features as every other weather app I would have stuck with the built in app that came with the phone."
2723,faeriemoon,"September 16, 2018",1,"Terrible new version (10) I have previously disliked Weather Channel App updates. I hate version 10. The initial graph is useless. I want to be able to open the app and see a current temp/condition and the high low for the day. Following that I want specifics like humdity, dew point, past 24hr precipitation. The lay out of having the current conditions small and minimal and then scroll through useless sections to get to my other weather info is frustrating and inconvenient. I will be moving over to WU for my weather."
2724,Thescionchef,"September 16, 2018",1,"Minimalistic Garbage harder to get what you need New format of the app is not good. I do not care about a graph line for the week when looking at the 5-10 day forecasts. I just want the forecast to be easy to read. Due to the graph everything is smaller and the days blend into the next. Harder to get the information I need as a business traveler to pack for he weekly trips. Sometime changing for the new is good, this is not one of those times. Long time user signing off to not use this app until it changes back."

2728,Sohappy5,"October 4, 2018",1,"Hate the update The old version was easy to read. In the new one, the font is so small that I’ve considered using a magnifying glass to read it. I don’t need glasses for anything but this app is now ridiculous. I’m going back to the app that came on my iPhone because the font is bold and it’s an easy to read bar graph. The line graph of this app doesn’t make it easier to read, it’s worse. I thought it was just because it was new but I’ve used it every day for a nearly a month and it’s not any better."
2729,Franco196745,"November 12, 2018",4,"Great Update! Huge improvement from the old version. So there is better formatting . My only critique is that having the title of “Weather Channel” should mean that it include maps with isobars/ atmospheric pressure readings, but is fails in having such a feature. Other than that, I am satisfied with the improvement of its current layout."

Did Watson get turned loose to redesign this on its own? Updating the app forces me to restore purchases (that I now regret) - the “feedback” link only opens an FAQ page, so hope Watson is paying attention to the reviews here.  This hot mess is now so overloaded on being everything but a weather app it’s useless as anything. It’s only function now is to keep my OCD in check by making an even number of app tiles on the screen."

While the one touch buttons are nice instead of having to scroll, I really hate the white background!  It is not as readable and the symbols like rain don’t show up well at all.  The former blue background was great.  Now you look like all the other weather apps!  👎🏻 please change the background back!"
2734,Rebfaye,"September 3, 2018",1,Update is horrible. The current update of this app is not visually friendly to use. The line graph of temperature takes up too much room and makes it difficult for me to understand what the weather even is! Details like humidity and chance of precipitation are no longer easy to locate. I miss the week at a glance. The current version is almost unreadable. I wish I could go back to the previous version. Looking for a different app to use. The videos are distracting. I hate this upgrade.

2739,Useless since update,"September 9, 2018",1,USED To be my fav but no more!! If I could give it a 0 I would. I am truly disappointed with this last update! I used this app daily and felt like it was pretty accurate and an extremely easy site to navigate. Now I can’t even see what the weather is doing outside at this moment other than the temp. Now you need directions to even try and navigate the site. Who has the time to click and swipe through several different screens? Bring back the old simple version please!!!

2748,BuffaloNic,"August 30, 2018",1,Old version was far superior. Not all changes for the better. The older version of this app was just fabulous. It had everything I wanted to add a glance I did not have to keep scrolling down and going to other pages to get what I wanted to see. Sometimes I wonder if people are just trying to justify their existence by revamping things unnecessarily.
2749,conbon328,"August 30, 2018",5,"Love the new interface Finally!! The Weather Channel decided to focus on the weather. Love the new app so so much.

As a NWS & Skywarn Weather Spotter I find that  not acceptable. The Radar on the Saved locations on the Weather Channel proper is too broad . It covers 3 states it needs to be more relevant to the saved locations The IPhone app is more accurate. & focused to the locations saved.

Today I logged into that app and it said that I had to upgrade. So I downloaded this app. This app is horrible. You have to scroll down just to see the weekly weather. The screens are cluttered. The old app came up up with a nice screen and was very easy to get to the weekly weather."

Go back into the app, turn them OFF again, repeat annoying cycle. "
2754,flowbleu,"April 29, 2018",2,Not as friendly! Precious version gave you the 10 day forecast at a glance.  This version has you scrolling down so you don’t see the entire thing in a hurry.  I don’t see any features which outweigh the negatives!  I will continue to use the previous version as long as it is available. I can always find more details there but usually I want an overview in a hurry and the ability to move between locations quickly.

There is no weather graph, radar is in a separate app. I already have RadarScope which is much better than the Storm Radar app. Also this all is another one that of those apps that mysteriously uses hundreds of megabytes of your cell data when you are not looking. On top of that it’s really slow to open and upgrade the forecast."
2757,ddboots,"May 27, 2018",2,Liked the previous version better I’ve use this app for quite a few years and liked it but I don’t like this version. I miss the humidity information and don’t like the box across the middle of the radar map showing the time lapse information. Why do you think that anyone would want that there???  Think I’ll look at the other weather apps. I have a feeling that I’ll find one I like better than this new version.

The thing is this app can’t predict the weather at all. “My local weather” when use my location comes to a town 15 miles away. There are newer and better apps out there for weather that doesn’t promo you to go premium every time you open the app. Weather app is now terrible. Hasn’t gotten any better in 5 months.

The previous version of The Weather Channel seemed simpler, easier, and the info ‘right there’."

This is absolutely ridiculous and is just another example of a corporation trying to exploit the consumer"

Recently y’all decided to profit by making us pay for a premium version of what we had for free with a few perks. I don’t want to pay because I don’t need the added BS. so I get punished with clunky force closing ads in my daily listing. Bad form dudes. I’ll be searching for a different app now. Should’ve left well enough alone and stayed away from the dollar signs.

I’ve deleted your app and it’s off to Accuweather for me."

Used to rely on this App but I guess the money grab for ads won out over usability.
2781,VespulaRegina,"November 26, 2019",2,"Revisions are not helpful The newest version of the Weather app are less useful than the previous versions. In particular, when there is a weather alert, it does not show up in the main panels, and the user must hunt for it in the settings. When the user selects “Details”, there is no response from the app, so it is no help at all. This is quite frustrating and can be negative in effect for those who need to prepare for emergencies."
2782,DWILK67,"November 10, 2019",3,"Quit trying to sell me an upgraded I used The Weather Channel app for years. It’s easy to use and fairly accurate. For some reason The Weather Channel decided I needed to upgrade to their “pro” version. Of course the pro version isn’t free. It’s annoying to have the upgrade BS pop up when I open the app, so I no longer use any app from The Weather Channel. Kudos on screwing up a good thing."
2783,Dmireid,"September 22, 2019",2,"Abusive ads! The increase and length of ads before every single video is simply abusive! They are up to 15 second ads now. I will not pay for this app, nor even look at it anymore because of the egregious waste of time in order to view a 30 second video. I can tolerate 5-8 second ads every 3-4 videos, but who wants to watch the same stupid ad, over and over again just to see an update of a storm track? Not me."
2784,Chieftain459,"September 1, 2019",2,"Great when it works... I've had this app on my phone for years, and find it pretty useful... When it works. But as often as not, it crashes, hangs up while loading, or needs to be closed out and reopened again to get the latest weather. Would be really nice if these issues (which have existed in one form or another as long as I can remember) were finally fixed so the app runs in a stable and useful fashion."

2786,NG0413,"July 11, 2019",1,App keeps erasing my saved alerts This app used to be awesome. I live in the Midwest and I am constantly checking the weather because it can change on a dime here and sometimes we get severe storms. But in the last year this app has gone downhill. I have saved my location numerous times and the app keeps deleting my saved location as well as my saved weather alerts. It is not helpful at all. Please fix as this used to be a very reliable that I could count on to keep my family safe.
2787,Ridge00,"July 2, 2019",4,Upgrades? All is ok.  Gets more complex and difficult to quickly see weather forecast with each new update.  Loaded with adds to upgrade to “premium” for 96 hour forecasts. I don’t get it - I should pay for them to be wrong twice as much? 
2788,JimboEll,"June 26, 2019",1,"Half star would be more accurate This app should be changed to just display a screen that says “we really don’t have a clue, you could do as well flipping a coin”. How can ‘the #1 weather app’ go from a forecast of 20% chance of rain at 9AM and forecast of widely scattered spotty showers to 90%chance of rain at 2PM with a band of heavy rain covering the entire state of Missouri? Clearly their teaming up with IBM’s Watson didn’t help. It does manage to get the date and time right so it gets half of a star. Switch to Weatherbug or WeatherUnderground."
2789,Skye Rivers,"June 24, 2019",5,"Great app! It is a great app! I loved the daily weather snapshot and all the detailed information on each and every place. I had a glitch that wasn’t able to let me in for a while, but the new update fixed that. Thank you and keep up the good work! 😊"
2790,sam_isaacs,"December 18, 2018",4,Almost there Overall app performance is decent. Had to refresh couple times but maybe due to connectivity. The ads are slightly annoying and I'd prefer if links pointed to content within the app instead of taking me to the weather channel website again.

2792,Chipmaster Jimbob,"January 28, 2019",1,"Crashes constantly This is literally the most frustrating app I've had, and it's only gotten worse over the years. From constant crashes, to the app not even opening without force closing it first, to having more ads inside the app than actual content, it's just plain terrible. Honestly it only works correctly about 15% of the time, and even when it does, I then get to play Russian Roulette by trying to avoid clicking one of the dozens of ads that fill the page."

2794,Carol Marie too,"March 29, 2019",3,"1:15  Friday March 23, 2019 It seems to me that each time the app is updated it’s just trying to fix the major update done about a year ago.

Now I must hunt for the weather."

I assumed after a while it would be fixed and you guys/gals would learn from your mistakes... but nope! After many years of using this app I am finally deleting. I’ve had enough.

I’m not sure what they were trying to fix or improve with the upgrade, but it is an overall big disappointment.  The previous version was very functional and easy to read.  The new version displays weather data poorly and lots of information seems no longer available.  I’d love to have the previous version back. I’m using weather underground more now."

I constantly get kicked out of it, it’s always trying to play an endless stream of videos, and, honestly, I’ve never been able to get the “future” radar to work. Ever. Why even have it on there?? The app freezes and shuts down just as often as I intentionally exit. It’s just not a good app and not very accurate either. Hey, Weather Channel, maybe spend less time faking live weather shots on tv, and put a little more effort into your app."
2802,c5wife,"October 8, 2018",1,Update to the Update Still too different from the old app.  All the swipe commands are still so different that I can’t use the app without inadvertently opening unwanted pages.  I used the old version so long that most swipes became unconscious so now I’m constantly opening the wrong page.    The new version isn’t good enough for me to put in the effort to learn the new navigation only to have it change in six months. I just moved the app to the last page and will use the apple wx app instead.  Sad.

I just want a quick easy to glance at weekly weather report"

Just paid for the no add version too. I am leaving the weather channel for an app that can give me a simple projected forecast without having to scroll thru several pages. This is what most people are interested in. However, if all your interested in is watching the weather channel all day then this app is for you. Adios weather channel."

New version loads slowly and displays vertically no longer has full functions on sub menu ( e.g. looking at 10 day forecast,  have to switch back to daily to change location ). If its not better than the airport sites,  not worth taking up space on my screen.  will try something else."

2807,Sst7372,"November 15, 2018",1,New version I have waited awhile to leave a review after the new version came out. I thought I’d get used to it and eventually like the changes. I no longer rely on the Weather Channel app and will be looking for a new app. The new layout and basic configuration appears more streamlined and easier to use but it is not at all for some reason. Another reviewer mentioned too much “white” and “thin lines”. This at first seemed trivial but there is some truth to that review. I will be shopping around unless changes are made.
2808,jamiro42,"November 19, 2018",1,"Recent update is not an improvement New update takes forever to load. If/when it does open, it either crashes within seconds, or gives me the hourly forecast for the **previous 12 hours.** That's really handy, if you have a TIME MACHINE. Ugh. The few times it works I've seen the new layout. Can't say I'm a fan of that either. I may warm up to it eventually...if I can keep the app open for more than 2 minutes.

I’m considering ending that because of this app... there are too many other things than weather that make it hard to get all the basic weather information in a quick way. I don’t need animal videos or all the other non weather stuff, there are better places to find those if I want them... I just want the weather. I understand some adds, but it’s all adds and hard to find weather."

Last but not least the app feedback link only takes you to troubleshooting via KBs; so I’ve launch App Store to review instead."

Just the last few days the whole app just freezes on you when your trying to get information. Bring back the old version or at least you could have given us a choice to update or not!!! Very possible deletion, will decide during Hurricane Florence and how the app works for me during the time I need it most."
2813,NotAFan2017,"September 9, 2018",2,They keep making it harder to read Is this like a shopping mall?  If we confuse the user enough they will stick around and watch more adds?  Guess what happened to the malls.  The new interface is really hard to read and now the location of things change every time you open the app so it’s hard to find the same thing.  The best version was two versions ago.  Your going in the wrong direction.  :(
2814,boston ma 1234,"September 11, 2018",1,"Bring back the old display! Please bring back the old weather app display. This app used to be great - simple, easy to read and navigate. Now it’s so hard to use. There is so much info displayed horizontally and it is very hard to read against the white background. Also, too many videos and screens that slide. I have used this app religiously for years and am so disappointed. I thought I would get used to the changes, but it’s been a few and instead I’m searching for a new weather app."

It used to have a nice calming background picture that went along with the current weather or time of day.... now it’s just white, bland and has no interesting aspects and so many adds. I find myself just listening to the radio or local tv weather for temperature and precipitation forecast only. I don’t even open the app unless it’s accidental now. IF they change it back some I would use it."

2819,Nellie3111,"September 26, 2018",2,"New update not as user friendly as expected It’s nice having tabs versus one long page to scroll with this new update. I think the new update is just busy looking, and not as simple to get to what you’re looking for as I expected. And I feel like the current weather is less accurate now for some reason. It was raining for hours one day and every time I check the current weather and radar, it said clear skies."

2826,dcmaze,"August 31, 2018",1,"Weather has gone bad Have used this app for years and watched the weather channel for decades.  This latest iteration is terrible.  The app was reliable and informative before now.  This latest version tells me nothing about what to expect at the moment, tomorrow, nor in the near future.

2841,DaiWil,"March 13, 2020",2,A Pattern Here I’ve had various iterations of this app on my devices for many years. The problem is that things go along smoothly for awhile and then it reverts to being less than worthy of the price of a subscription.  I stopped purchasing subscriptions a few years ago. I just checked recent reviews to see if the premium version is worth the cost this time around. Obviously it is not.  Don’t fall for all the hype.  It’s a bad sign.

Every time I open it, every single time, I’m prompted to “Go premium”. I don’t want premium, I just want to see the weather. Adds pop up all the time that won’t allow you to close for 10-15. This is getting worse than a clickbait gaming app. Lose the adds or lose people that actually use your app. It’s very annoying."
2844,Whiteside23,"January 18, 2020",1,"Really frustrated with the changes Ever since the last update there is no time on the radar which makes it extremely hard to plan for safety. I’m not sure if this is a bug or part of the premium nonsense but after YEARS of using this app I’m increasingly more unhappy. I understand premium options and earning money, but I don’t understand taking things away that were originally free. I would rather get rid of it all together than be roped into paying for things that already existed."
2845,SB215,"January 17, 2020",2,"Sick of all the ads I used to love this app, but the number of ads has gotten ridiculous! It’s hard to skim through the weather quickly with ads  popping up constantly. It’s also gotten much slower, likely due to all of this advertising content. And I refuse to pay an annual fee with so many other weather apps to choose from. Sadly I am moving on.  Hopefully they will change their approach and I can come back one day."
2846,Nerak 65,"January 12, 2020",1,Premium is pathetic I have used the weather channel app for years. They recently started loading advertisements in the daily section between each day. This was very annoying so I went to the premium. It took away the ads but left a huge blank space where the ads were at. Deleting the app and downloading did not fix this. This really was not worth it. I subscribed to the yearly for $9.99 instead of monthly for $0.99 thinking it was the better deal. What a waste of money.
2847,kiki0731,"January 10, 2020",2,Updated Format Recently updated the Ap and do not care for the new format at all. I miss the information regarding current weather conditions at the very top which is now found further down. Also the hourly in a listed format was much better than the side slide graph version.  There is also no longer a time projection on the interactive radar. That makes it impossible to gage the future projection is any way that matters.

So when I see sunny weather predictions for the next day or two, I’m not expecting a surprise thunderstorm when the humidity level is at a reasonable percentage. So what gives?  Maybe the Doppler radar in my area is a piece of worthless junk and You dev guys can use this review as evidence that they need to upgrade."

There’s lots of graphs and charts which are nice , but you can’t customize if you see them or not. For me , in my 30s it’s just not very intuitive. I used to love this app but not anymore."

The interface has changed a lot but the actual forecasting has been pretty good - until lately. It’s terrible now, particularly with forecasting rain.

I have 3 kids. I need reliability. The lag was so bad. I got a total of 4 tornado warnings, but only 3 were legit. One was a repeat of the first one. Tonight was the final straw.

I find it was harder to use now then before. Looks like they tried to do an ios update & changed the whole format. Wish they would just go back to the original.

I used to use it all the time... always knew the weather and I loved watching all the 30 second videos. It really frustrates me when people “fix something that isn’t broken”. If you have this many users.... you should do a trial of a new version or even a poll asking if we would like one before you go and change everything! And for the worse!!

2890,Water Rock,"September 3, 2018",1,Highly Disappointed Hate the new update! Now this app has gone the way of many others and it’s disappointing. I want the ability to easily access a weekly forecast without scrolling...a week at a glance. A detailed forecast is great when you want..well...DETAILS.  But most of the time I just want to look and quickly get an idea of what the week looks like...to see the forecast not read it. This app will now be lumped in with the five other weather apps I have on my phone and don’t use.

All I want to know is what the weather and temperatures are going to be for the next couple of days.  I don’t want to try to decipher what’s going on with the sine wave thing and all of the technical info.  I live in the NW so I generally don’t care about hurricanes and I never watch the videos.

2897,Katita_Patita,"September 25, 2018",1,"Nice try, but try again Coming from someone who adapts and appreciates change, I’m not sure why a drastic change was necessary in this case. I often would go to this app to keep an eye on long term (more than 5 days) and for the 48-hr play-by-play. The 15 day quick forecast used to be vertically displayed. Now, it’s horizontal. Given that the orientation of phones is usually vertical, why would you change this? The 48-hour forecast shown vertically is a hard swipe left. Super disappointed with all this."

That, combined with their insistence upon promoting their climate change dogma, have prompted me to delete this app.  Units of measure are mixed (Fahrenheit and Celsius) in the same forecast.  Have e-mailed them.  Of course, they are way too arrogant to respond.  They managed to combine an extremely ugly design with illegible graphics.  Too many adds.  Radar takes forever to load.

2900,Tbvabch,"June 27, 2018",1,Bad to Worst This app keeps getting worst. You use to be able to scroll right to left or left to right to view the weather at all your locations. That was great to check the weather where family and friends live.  Now you have to call up your locations and select each individual location to view its weather very cumbersome and time consuming.  I've reach a point that I've stopped using the app and use to view it several times a day. Fix the app.
2901,deemollenkamp,"July 30, 2018",1,"The old app was better The radar on this new app is slower than the old app.  The bar placement is better on the old app also.  No one needs to see that much of the bar.  It blocks the view.  Put it back in the corner where it used to be.  The ads take up enough room.  The only thing I like better on the new app is the location dot instead of the pin.  The pin on the old app blocked some of the map because of the word bubble, but overall the old app is better for radar."
2902,Jenn6715,"August 29, 2018",1,"Version 10.0 I hate this version. Both my fiancé and i were forced to upgrade, our app just stopped working until we did. It is awful. We liked that you could scroll and see what the next few hours/days had and now instead of a today/tonight with the option to view hourly, you can only view hourly. I can’t see my weather for tomorrow or this weekend, so the convenience of making plans is gone. We will be deleting until a new version comes up."

2905,GrandyRen,"August 30, 2018",1,Horrible update I would give this new version a negative 5 star rating if I could. I truly wish I could undo this update. My husband looked at mine and decided not to update his. I am so tired of change for the sake of change. Why take a perfectly good app and mess with it? Just so they could claim they have something new and therefore it must be better? This is definitely NOT a better format.

2906,Dang free apps,"September 1, 2018",1,The new update is terrible! I loved Weather channel app and have used it for years.  The videos are entertaining and the weather was always easy to see and navigate.  The new update is TERRIBLE!  It is hard to find the weather details you actually want to see and you cannot find any the specifics you are looking for.  It looks more like the Accuweather app that I never used because it was hard to navigate. I am now on the hunt for a new app for my weather.  I don’t like this one any more at all.

They’ll tell you there’s a 80% chance of rain at 9am with the rash showing a huge storm coming in and then all day they just push it back farther and farther and next thing you know it never rained. Or they’ll say it’s sunny when it’s cloudy and rainy very frustrating for someone that works outside.
2998,bot impressed,"March 31, 2020",5,Love the app I love this app so much! We all know that the apple weather app isn’t the best and there’s other apps that also rip you off. This app is defiantly legit since it’s connected to the TV channel Weather channel. It’s also helpful to get alerts about upcoming weather events
2999,Kikitwitme,"March 23, 2020",1,From bad to worse I used to use only this app for my weather needs. As the years went by I downloaded other apps for different things. Most fund different apps are better than others for specific measurements like wind speed or rainfall totals etc... but as time went on this app just got worse. The user friendly aspect of this app is lacking. The ads are getting out of hand. It just overall is my least favorite weather app now. So bad that I will be deleting.
3000,GregCuc,"March 17, 2020",1,"Too many ads I’ve had this app for a long time and recently updated it (I don’t update apps often, so this was a major change). It now has ads pop up whereas before the ads were just integrated into the interface. There, but not in your face annoying. Now they are in your face annoying. Asking you to upgrade to their premium service, etc. I can’t stand ads that disrupt your usability. So I’ve deleted the app and will find another weather app to use."
3001,Squatting Hen,"March 11, 2020",2,"Screw Premium Paid for weather Max yeas ago, and you guys decided it was too cheap and disabled it for all paid users. Now we have to use the ad version or pay a substantial amount more. Whatever. I use the ad version, but holy heck!!! Stop with the Premium pop ups. I will NEVER pay that and all you are doing is making me use another app. Stop with the annoying premium push every time I open the app. Greedy and ridiculous."
3002,rlo123,"February 23, 2020",1,"Still haven’t learned The UI is still small and difficult to see.  Hourly and daily icons are minuscule and use light grey on white making them very hard to quickly check.  The overall screen scrolls jumpy, possibly due to higher memory and cpu requirements?   Please bring back the darker background UI with larger icons so the app is usable again. If you aren’t sure what I mean just take a look at your original generation app or at Weatherbug, they have it about right with their UI these days."
3003,archangel1701,"February 18, 2020",3,Great with one really annoying problem Of all the apps out there this one has the best interface and is the most reliable...
3004,BR HOG,"February 18, 2020",1,"Worse than ever....delete, delete, delete done This is an updated review.....Done!!!!  Format is terrible.  Too hard to read the print.  The older version was much better.  There was no reason to change this app.  I don’t even bother to use this app any more. It was fine before you fluffed it up.  It is hard to read, washed out colors.  Should have left it alone.  Moving on.  Oh yes, hey everybody!!!! ....  the Dark Sky weather app works great!!!!  A lot easier to use, and easier to read.  Deleted this app."
3005,Drijien,"February 9, 2020",2,"Downhill after last update This used to be my go to weather app. After their last major update and the awful layout changes... not so much. The old app was informative and intuitive with minimal adds that did not detract from the app. Now you are inundated with obnoxious adds at every turn, blocking info and pirating the screen. The layout is cumbersome and flows like a mud puddle. I get change is good but bad change is just that."
3006,PT girl,"February 6, 2020",1,"Usually excellent I used to use this app ALL the time (I am talking for years), and found it to be quite reliable. It still works well on my phone, but now I am unable to open it on my iPad. It crashes & will no longer open. Every. Single. Time. "
3007,juleslovesmusic,"February 5, 2020",3,My wish Is there a way to turn off the premium ad when I first open the app? I need to get to the weather and when I open the app it immediately goes to an ad to upgrade. This is crappy especially if you need quicker access to conditions. I do not see anything that would allow me to disengage that to stop asking me. Change it please.
3008,Eternaljourney,"February 2, 2020",1,"Hate the new design I sont need a dashboard with widgets. The only reason i prefered this app over the free apple one is because it showed an easy to see extended forecast. Now all i see are miniaturized widgets. That cannot be altered or enlarged. Overrall, this is a junky over-simplified layout that begs the user for a paid subscription. If they do not revert to a more user friendly interface i will permanently delete and never re-use. I will also tell other people how awful this app is. Thank you for ruining a perfect app."
3009,Sunthebun1,"January 17, 2020",4,Much better. The app is much better now. Please be more specific on the wind speed. I would like to know what the higher wind gusts are when the wind gust is 25 mph and higher. The national weather service in Aberdeen South Dakota reports the higher wind gust when reporting the current weather conditions each hour. I would appreciate it.
3010,GWPRN,"January 10, 2020",1,"Don’t waste your money on Premium I have been using premium for over 6 months - purchased it so I could have extended hourly forecasts.  Unfortunately, it stopped working on my IPad which is what I primarily use.  I have contacted support twice about this and have received no response!  They need to do a much better job of customer support when there are issues.  If there is a known bug they could at least admit that and give a time frame for resolution!  Very dissatisfied right now."
3011,Derek49,"December 26, 2019",3,Not so good... App now crashes when hitting the bottom menu “Hourly” link (although the hourly summary box does work). So not so good part one. Part two not so good is the lack of communication. It seems as though the organization responsible for the app is only on receive and never on send - sadly been that way for a while which makes me wonder why I bother sending in a question ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3012,Hddhcsdyjkbcxdhvdggdgv,"November 21, 2019",2,"It works eventually This was my go-to weather app for years. In the past few months the app has gotten slow and the features have become a pain to use. More often than not when I open the app I have to wait 30 or so seconds for everything to load up before I can use it. Deleting/reinstalling and hard phone resets don’t help, so I’m guessing the app itself is just annoyingly slow now."
3013,Msandberg,"November 12, 2019",2,Premium rip off Let me start with saying I love the weather channel app.  So much so that I purchased the premium upgrade.  Nothing changed whatsoever....and I still kept getting notices to upgrade to premium.  My credit card was charged and no upgrade occurred.  I reached out to the app developers 3 times through the lame email option.   No response after a week. Requested a refund and have been told it’s going to be issued.  Waste!
3014,raw chacken,"November 6, 2019",4,"premium price i love this app. tried others but i keep coming back to this one. i would consider paying for the premium version IF it was a one time fee of $9.99 as opposed to $9.99 a year. nobody likes monthly subscription charges either. would have given 5 stars, but taking one off due to this fee structure."
3015,Stretch816,"November 6, 2019",4,Better and better This app seems to get better and better and I absolutely rely on it for my day to day checks.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the inability to rearrange tiles.  For example I don’t care for the video clips so I’d like the option to remove tiles or push them lower down the screen.
3016,Skiing momma,"October 13, 2019",4,Love the app and the wx channel Love you guys but please stop naming snowstorms!!! Otherwise I could give you 5 stars!
3017,lunch was to much for uber,"September 23, 2019",3,Suggestion Great for information however the radar leaves a bit to be desired. Try adding more professional information and longer radar links with  better imaging and forecasting speed as well. It ok for general public but not the greatest for mariners. Wind speeds would be a nice addition not just directions. Updated barometric pressure scale showing last 12/ 24 hrs.
3018,Goodtxn1962,"September 22, 2019",3,Weather Alerts stopped working I paid the $9.99 subscription price to have a better experience on this app like I did before. I have no idea what’s wrong but I can no longer get rain alerts or any weather alerts like before. I am really disappointed and if I could get my money back I would cancel my subscription. This app has really gone down hill
3019,Klhunz,"September 14, 2019",1,"Terrible app for iPad I have used the weather channel app on my phone and iPad for years and it has always worked very well. For the last six months or so I cannot get the app for iPad to work. It is constantly crashing and I have to go in and reset the app which doesn’t always seem to solve the problem. My iPad is under a year old and has plenty of space, so it’s not my problem. I will be deleting this app for my iPad and looking for something that will actually work."

3021,BigChungus3000,"May 30, 2019",5,Great Weather App This is definitely the best weather app I’ve ever had. It shows you a list of days and a percentage  of precipitation for each one of those days. It also shows you the upcoming weather within the next few hours. Great app. 👍
3022,bobbiemcb,"June 4, 2019",2,"Weather Once again, your predictions go from severe weather to no rain at all. This happens in the winter when predicting snow as well.  With your forecasters bragging about your equipment, it is only correct maybe 50% of the time. Guess I will stick to looking out the window. It’s more accurate. You get people all worked up for severe weather and snow storms that hardly ever pan out. Must be in cahoots with grocery stores so we stock up for nothing"
3023,Jmhghfgjghfjghcjh,"September 2, 2019",1,"Unstable app I have downloaded two other weather apps because of the instability of this app. Every time I use this app, I have to open it at least twice because it crashes and closes. I have waited patiently through update after update hoping it will improve,  but it still crashes. I never take time to review apps, but this app is so annoying that I am wasting my time to write this review because I again just wasted my time trying to get this app to open properly."
3024,Hyrum Kingston Smith lll,"August 16, 2019",4,"Ratings I do love getting the weather forecast from your app.  Don’t get upset but, I am not a believer in man made global warming.  So, I get tired of hearing that we are somehow controlling every weather event.  "
3025,so you dont a review after all,"August 11, 2019",4,Great information I love how informative it is ‘ but I seem to be having more problems with it lately.  I even deleted the app and reinstalled it hoping it would help.   Many times it doesn’t open up or it drops off and I have to restart.   Otherwise it’s great to have the information when I want it.
3026,Longristra,"July 16, 2019",3,Not as accurate This used to be my go to weather app but I’ve found that over the last few updates it has become much less accurate with precipitation. Make the hourly weather forecast more accurate with precip likelihood percentages like you used to have and you have a 4 star app. Get rid of the bug that locks out my music and you’ve got 5.
3027,Mom5+5,"July 4, 2019",5,"Live by it! I have used this app for years.  It’s extremely accurate.  When compared to apps my family members use, this one “wins” every time.  It has made me the official family “weathermom!”  The “what to wear today” debate comes to a quick end with this app, too!"
3028,Left Coast native,"June 22, 2019",3,"This app is completely fine I find local weather quickly, the radar is really helpful when the weather is changing, I can track the systems that affect my area. Not a lot of detail, but I use another weather website for that. Some complain about ads but they are everywhere these days, annoying but easy to ignore."
3029,Shark2s,"June 12, 2019",2,"Haven’t liked it since the upgrade The app is very slow, even more so recently, and the many videos and ads make it difficult to scroll and find the content I’m looking for (ie. The radar or allergy content). It crashes frequently now for me as well and if I don’t have a WiFi signal I might as well forget checking the weather because it takes a couple minutes to even open. Grrrr."
3030,Ark the Hillbilly,"March 12, 2019",5,Weather made simple Easy to use app with all you could want in forecasting in any part of the country! Dependable and seemingly accurate!

3033,ellejay555,"April 3, 2019",2,"Horrible update I used I love this app and checked it daily, as I’m a runner and look at things like wind speed and direction, air temp and feels like temp. With the last couple of updates, I can’t even find that information. It was so simple before, now I spend far too long just trying to find the feels like temp... it’s way too busy and difficult to navigate.  Horrible update on my opinion. I’ll be looking for a new app to replace it."
3034,michaeldnc,"April 7, 2019",2,"2 - For the good times As many others have written, The Weather Channel app is dwindling faster than the glaciers. The latest update is by far the worst as it loads less than half the time so I rely on local news sites. I am am on iOS 12.3 Beta 1 but the issues started prior to the iOS update. Perhaps devote more resources where needed instead of trying to turn the app into YouTubeWeather. Rating two stars for the good times of yesteryears."

Its now hard to decipher what the actual weather is because it’s hard to see and read, don’t like the grayline temp graph, app is hard to navigate back and forth from different cities. Don’t appreciate ads or the fact they cover content, dont want videos. Just want the weather for at least s 10 day stretch. There’s a saying “if it aint broke don’t fix it.” The app wasn’t broke so there was no need to fix or “improve” it."
3038,NJYR,"May 11, 2019",3,"NJ Very disappointed with this updated app on my iPhone. It is difficult to read the daily, weekly and hourly since it is all white color now. The layout of new app is horrible. The line showing the high is not needed. I know how to read the numbers. Having the daily weekly where you have to swipe right to left should vertical like the hourly. I’m deleting the app also."
3039,Marro 2SS,"May 21, 2019",1,Got worse and worse with every update. I’m deleting it The last update ruined this app. I hate the way you have navigate through it. And there are two options for “daily” and two options for “hourly” and they’re both different. And the number one thing and the reason I’m getting a different app is the 7 day forecast will show sunny or partly sunny and you think it’s not going to rain. But then you click on the day and it says “scattered thunderstorms in the evening”. So it lies.

Now, it is unfriendly to use. I was starting to wonder about the direction of the app, and The Weather Channel itself, when more and more non-weather related videos were making their way onto the app in an obvious play to beat other “fake news” social media to the punch.

I cannot change saved locations & keep getting alerts about a location of no interest. Ads & videos waste resources. The app seems to look for them first then claims internet connection issues before displaying the weather. The new color schemes blend into one another & cannot distinguish parts easily. The slightest touch goes to undesired parts while just trying to swipe vertically or horizontally.

The information just blurs together making it difficult to distinguish the forecast from day to day.  I’ve been loyal user for over ten years and have tried to adjust to the new format but just can’t.  I’m sorry to say I am deleting the app in search of a new one.  Please feel free to let me know if you make some changes.  Sounds like I’m not the only one that is disappointed.

There’s not even just a weekly overview simply showing what the forecast will be. You have to scroll through some kind of graph. Maybe it’s just me, but I’m switching back to the weather app pre-loaded on my phone because it lists everything needed in one view, no scrolling and trying to figure it out."

If I paid for it before why should I have to pay again? Further more the new update isn’t so good. The radar doesn’t depict what is going on up to date unless your on WiFi. What good is it. The weather Channel is renowned for providing the best weather information possible and it’s not living up to its name!! Come on weather channel you can do better.

It is difficult to get the wanted information, the videos are too long to get to the point, for example, when I need the path of a tropical disturbance or storm I do not want to sit through over five minutes of some weather person babbling about, I just want to see the projected path. I just want the necessary information. I am looking for a different app to use."
3067,lmeeaton,"September 5, 2018",2,Change for the worse The one good thing about the old version is now gone. The weather notification and warnings screen is gone. For instance a significant weather advisory was issued but when I wanted more info there was nothing in the app regarding it.

I wish the radar map was easier to navigate and use but overall satisfied with the app."
3075,Shorty433,"August 17, 2018",5,It’s the weather! This should always have a five star rating because they are telling you what the WEATHER is and is going to be! If you don’t need to know then you wouldn’t use this app! Thank you everyone that works at weather channel and on the app!

3077,jas194,"August 28, 2018",2,Poor update 28 Aug 2018:  Why have you hidden the current temperature? The single most important weather variable should be way more prominent and should be on the page with all the other current conditions. It boggles the mind that the app designers don’t understand this. 
3078,Jimmy72764,"August 28, 2018",1,"Horrible Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, you come out with this redesigned app that looks like something a third grader would put together. Oh, and the forecasting is the most inaccurate I have ever seen. I can look at the forecast and then check back 5 minutes later and it says something completely different. The fact you are changing your forecast every 5-10 minutes tells me that you aren’t even confident in what you are forecasting."
3079,jwt69,"August 29, 2018",5,Best weather app Since I have started using this app I have found it to be spot on with the information for my area. Most predictions have been accurate and the weather event happened within minutes of the forecast. Wonderful app.

3082,laurenr19,"March 2, 2018",1,"App still slow / freezing after update I love the features in this app, but it must be weighed down with too much stuff because it's SO slow to load and often crashes mid-session. Scrolling down to see more has a lag of 3-5 seconds each time. They'd be better off taking out some of the features just to make it more reliable. The app has been this way for years. The developers must just keep patching away and not fixing the core load time issues."

3084,Zsales14,"March 6, 2018",5,Is a great app but has one small problem. The app is overall great. It’s gives you the 10 day forecast and has the hourly feature. The only small problem is their radar never goes with their 10 day forecast or hourly. Overall the app is awesome.
3085,Georg Marcum,"April 4, 2018",5,Great app I have had this app a long time. It never failed me.  If I had one thing to change is to have the announcements of rain or storms come before it starts.   Right now those announcements are coming across well after the event starts or when the event is over
3086,Jmolt5667,"April 4, 2018",2,"The constant ability to be wrong is beyond me The UI on this app is really bad. It lags and just isn’t user friendly. The old versions of this app were so much better and didn’t involve so much scrolling. The weather forecast and updates are constantly wrong as well, which is really frustrating. Today I got three updates from this app saying it was about to snow, when in reality it was sunny all day and didn’t snow a flurry."

Besides the near constant notification alert that’s always highlighted, but when I click into the app, there’s no notification there. Total failure by your developers."

3095,Who ev's,"January 22, 2020",3,Nice app but Crashes every time I use it. I like this weather app and the way it’s laid out. It’s probably one of the best weather app when it comes to that. But for 6 months to a year the app crashes every time you use it. Specially it you back out for a second to check something else. It is very frustrating. If it wasn’t for that it would be a 5 star app.
3096,Much-ado,"January 11, 2020",1,I paid for no ads. A year. Still have all ads I paid $9.99 for no ads. App still looks exactly the same.  Still has all ads. Still keeps asking me to go premium  And probably missing premium features but I wouldn’t know for certain because acts the same. Thought it would be great being IBM and the weather channel. Just doesn’t work. Wish I could get my money back. Disappointed Apple doesn’t monitor these apps better for quality. Not a good experience.

(Probably because of acquisition by IBM) This was always my go to app. While I have seen many unfavorable changes in the app over the years, over the last few months the app is practically garbage now. You are always asked to purchase premium every time you open the app and now you are BOMBARDED with advertisements and clickbait videos. Sad to see this app go so far downhill. I have been using the Darksky app lately, which is alright and I hope they improve some of their maps."

To many adds more adds than useful information. If local television broadcasts where available where I live I would dump this app and the rest of the add filled apps that no longer offer current wind speeds. Wind speed has been the main reason for me to use the app.
3100,Nickoconnor,"December 28, 2019",3,"Used to be my favorite app This app was everything, used to have all the features I wanted in a weather app, radar,10 day forecast, hourly forecast , and different layers in radar.

3101,Faithful Louisvillian,"December 28, 2019",3,Annoying The app was great and useful until it started to ask me to join the Premium Subscription every time I open it. If u wanted the premium subscription I would have already paid for it. There needs to be a way to opt out so we don’t constantly get a pop up asking me to get a premium subscription. We know where to find it if we want it.

I’m probably going to end up deleting the app because the new update just make it so much more difficult to figure out the weather is on any given day."

The is NOT social media & nobody cares how the weather is “trending.”  For many people who would view this app it’s a matter of life & death.  Previously, one page would provide all the essential information needed. The question now is TWC are you aiming for function or fashion.

That stupid waving line with the daily temperatures is difficult to easily scan and I’m not interested in the long details you have by pushing the menu button. Why is everything in the dumb cards? You end up wasting space with two margins: one for the card and one inside the card. Not Weather Channel’s best effort. Rated 1 star cause I can’t rate it zero.

I keep getting them via notifications, but when I open the app they are nowhere to be found! Severe weather alerts change from hour to hour. I want the details. It is frustrating that I have to now track them down via another resource. I’ve used this weather app for YEARS and now have to find another."
3227,fuzzy4034,"April 24, 2019",1,Very frustrated The Weather Channel app is extremely glitchy. It freezes up constantly & then suddenly closes. It will not save my favorite locations—I have entered them multiple times only to find out that they disappear. Theres also way too much going on in this app—I have a feeling that’s contributing to its poor performance. I’ll have to search for a better performing weather app as trying to use The Weather Channel app is extremely frustrating!
3228,DeveloperMatt,"May 3, 2019",2,"Reliability issues I’ve used the app for a long time, and have even subscribed to remove ads, but I’m not sure it’s worth it to continue paying. There appears to be a 30-50% chance that the app will load weather data."
3229,juhym,"May 11, 2019",5,This app is great. Always correct. This app is great for looking at the weather and it is always correct when severe storms are approaching my city. It’s also good because it gives percentages and wind directions and gives you severe weather warnings and watches ahead of time.
3230,okc71577,"September 18, 2018",1,"Great weather app! I use this app daily.  I would give this 5 stars. It is my go to source for accurate up to date weather information.

I enjoy watching the short news clip videos which are entertaining, informative and brings the world closer to me."
3231,Lethal_les,"September 24, 2018",1,New layout is terrible The new layout is absolutely terrible. The app is not user friendly at all! I can’t find a basic 5 day forecast. The scrolling menu 1 of 7 is terrible! When I didn’t find the future forecast it has a weird wave line thing that make it incredibly difficult to understand at a quick glance. I had to “study” the forecast to understand that line wave thing to know what tomorrow’s weather will be like. Please change it back to the old version!

Please fix this!"
3233,fireplace369,"October 4, 2018",3,"Used to be great Since the new update a month or two ago this app worked fine and had no problems. This new update has just made the entire app more confusing.

I find myself constantly scrolling to try to just get a better view or to see the hourly view. The new small display is just not a helpful way to see the data for the day. I don’t may to constantly have to scroll to see humidity and the current weather conditions are basically hidden in the top banner. "

I know, first world probs, but when I open the week’s forecast I wanna see it clearly, at the top of the page with the option to expand each day if necessary. Time for a new app...or Apple could steal an idea from Droid and just display the freaking weather on the home screen"
3237,Sirait1977,"December 6, 2018",1,"Bring back the blue and row based hourly weather, please! Ever since the new version, i am not sure if the product owner listened to stakeholders versus users when deciding to change the theme to white. It’s hard to read and smaller fonts. The weather progress is not clear. When hourly-based where every hour was in single row is cleaner. So, developers, please listen to us, end users, bring back the old layout and theme and use the empty spaces that is so wasted in the current version. Thanks."
3238,Jaely9,"December 15, 2018",4,Use it every day I used to look at this app every day. I thought I would get used to the new design but I can’t. The old one was so much better. I use the radar to track storms but that’s about it now.

But this one is different from what I used before. It’s not a smart version. The older version is very clear, I clicked it and knew the current temperature, then second click I knew the temperature for the whole day, the third click I will know what it’s like the 7 days. "

Especially if you’re driving (yes, I shouldn’t be looking at it while  I’m driving).  I don’t usually post reviews but I’m hopeful mine will help add to the numbers of those asking  to bring the contrasting colors back and lose the goofy line.

This new update was not needed. It’s awkward to use, the home page is a squiggly line that we can do without. It is not as user friendly as the previous version and just takes away from the UX (user experience) completely. "
3243,kmkostel,"September 14, 2018",1,"HATE the new format - bloated & hard to see This is the first review I’ve ever written. But this app has gone from mildly annoying to virtually useless.  In the past, if you could get around all the adds, videos, and clickbait you could at least quickly assess the weather. Now you still have all of that, but the screen is so busy and the icons & text so tiny, that it’s almost unusable on my phone. Definitely need to find an alternative if this the wave of this apps future."

If you are looking at future radar it will start at current time. When I go between these two the current radar on past is completely different then current radar on future.

Everyone I know agrees and uses a different weather app now. Also, was the uv index removed? I can’t find it. I’m looking for a new weather app today."

It’s too difficult to find the humidity, the chance of rain, etc. The update is one of the worst app updates I have ever seen. Remember, the folks who forecast the weather and the folks who want to see what the weather is going to be like are two completely different kinds of people. Very, very disappointed 👎👎👎👎👎"

3250,Escape510,"August 29, 2018",4,Great App! This weather app is very useful for me. I drive daily and I like to get weather info. The app has beautiful backgrounds and I love the videos! The videos show other weather related events that happen around the world- so interesting! No weather forecast is perfect but The Weather Channel is close enough for me! Great job!
3251,math wizard,"August 29, 2018",5,"Change I would like less unnecessary information about animals, places and so many ads. I would like less changes to the way the app looks as I get used to it and you change it not so much a good change."
3252,Toddwfisk,"August 29, 2018",1,"From solid and useful to just bad Why make such a radical change? Navigation is now confusing and the clear overview of the daily and weekly weather I used to get easily is now lost in a mass of moving cards and odd choices of swiping and navigation choices. The previous clear, solid, blue design i could just scroll up and down through is now a whispy white design with the key info now very hard to extract easily. WHY? I will likely look for a replacement app. Too bad."
3253,Dhhjjcd,"August 30, 2018",1,"Beware version 10.0 is a nightmare The new version 10.0 is terrible. The 5 day  weather is difficult to understand. The all white background makes it very difficult to read. Especially at night, it just hurts your eyes with the brightness. Whoever is in charge of ads on your app needs fired. I didn’t come to check the weather and see ads for porn sites. Nice to find this when my grandkids accidentally clicked on it. Great job guys. Way to ruin what was once a great weather app."

3256,IHJ2014,"September 4, 2018",1,"Used to be good I liked this app just fine until the update. Now it’s less user friendly and more cumbersome. The old 5 day/10 day forecast was much easier to see at a glance - now you have to look at a graph line to see the temperature “trend” - who cares? I just want to see the high and low temps fires casted for a particular day. And the little icon at the bottom is really pale and hard to read - is it cloudy, foggy or rain? Only the ones with sun are really visible. Looking for a new app to use now"
3257,Categorizing failure,"September 6, 2018",1,"Strongly dislike recent changes The recent updates to the screens make it extremely difficult to get weather trends at a glance. The new Hi & low temps beside each other instead of on top of each other only let’s me see 2 days at a time.  Having to go to different pages for hourly instead of scrolling is a pain. Paging through 7 screens, down & back up was actually 14, to see air quality. Ugh! Please please please go back to previous display version!!!"
3258,K_Crayon,"September 7, 2018",2,"Recent update too excessive. The recent update to this app is very confusing. It’s not intuitive, or easy to use. It’s almost like they decided that to be competitive they needed all kind of swipeable tabs and random toggle buttons."
3259,Lunvy,"September 9, 2018",1,"App ruined Downloaded this app years ago for quick, easy to read, detailed weather. Also liked that I could save several cities to readily check the weather when I would be going there.  First they reduced the saved cities so I could only keep four on my list besides my hometown.  Now they’ve completely reconfigured the whole thing so it takes three or four clicks just to find my daily weather forecast.  Guess it’s time to delete this one..."
3260,That Westside Guy,"May 21, 2018",2,"A definite step backward The original Weather Channel app wasn’t wonderful, but it was at least relatively easy to navigate to the information you wanted to see. This new app is slower, and information takes more steps to get to - it’s main reason for existence seems to be to cram even more ads more intrusively into every conceivable nook and cranny. "
3261,Davidm6375,"May 24, 2018",1,"Still unreliable I stopped using this app several years ago because it was unreliable. A few days ago I decided to give it another shot. After all this time, it is still unusable. The new update says you no longer need to login to set notifications but when I try to set them, the app says that I have to select a location...something it won’t let me set to begin with. That was the 10% of the time I was actually able to get the app to open."
3262,kaosiam,"May 24, 2018",2,Update Fail Since the update yesterday the weather channel app will not load. I get the background with Weather Channel logo and a spinning wheel.  Of course it’s happening as things are starting to happen out in the gulf.  Please address this and fix it. I have come to count on the APP for warnings to Weather Alerts and act accordingly.  I am running IOS 11.3.1.  Just turned on the Weather Channel and they are using a Chalkboard this morning?
3263,-[FI]-Hellyea,"June 25, 2018",2,Used to love the app. This used to be a great app. I could check weather over many zip codes but now you have to enter them one by one to see weather in other areas. I also liked seeing several days of weather at the home screen. Basically the old home screen looked great. The background looked great before and now its kind of a bland grey or brown dreary look now. The background looks like you are caught in a sand storm.
3264,ecainer,"August 17, 2018",1,"Terrible Like others, I had been a longtime user of TWC Max. It was perfect. Then you updated and pushed us to this crappy version. It's terrible. Here's what I want/miss: single page 10 day and hourly forecast with temp, percent rain, and wind, with an option to check the radar. That's it. No videos or ads or maps or any of the other clutter you're forcing on us now. More is not better. I would pay a lot of money just to be able to hide/customize what is shown. It is SO cluttered."

Every time they come up with a new release promising to fix bug and performance issues, it gets worse. It literally takes 30 seconds to find out what the weather is.

3272,LifetimePioneer,"February 26, 2018",1,Stuck ads The weather is usually accurate. My big problem is that your stupid ads (right now the soup ad) gets stuck when I’m trying to watch a 30 second video. It’s NOT my internet connection because everything else works fine. The other issue is that I can understand one or two ads but why do I have to watch a 15-30 second commercial between each video. Even when the video I want to watch is 30 seconds or less.

But now that they’ve updated the iPad version and are forcing me to switch to a similar clunky design like their iPone app, I’m ditching the Weather Channel apps for good.

3303,Plasmaq,"July 17, 2019",2,Slow and not as accurate If I had time to watch the local news more I would be better off. He has much better read on the weather. This app takes too long to refresh with all the ads and nonsense. The weather forecast changes back and forth multiple times a day. You would thing the Weather Channel could be more accurate. This app is not very useful.

3306,Scooby575,"July 4, 2019",2,"Keeps getting worse It’s bad enough the app’s basic functionality keeps getting worse with constant crashes, half loading, and other glitches, but now they want to start charging for more than 96 hours of forecast?!? Try getting the app to work properly first before trying to charge for one of the least accurate of the “sciences” AccuWeather is so much better an experience."
3307,phunlee,"June 24, 2019",2,Good info. Terrible stability Love the app when it decides to work. It is constantly crashing and usually takes 2-3 attempts to open before it’s useable. On iPhone XS. The information is incredibly important and useful and I over the recent format improvements. But why is it so hard to start up? It’s like a car with a dying battery trying to start it. Hope to see stability improvements in the future.

3310,EDCchick,"February 3, 2019",2,"These latest Updates Ruined it Why can’t apps leave well enough alone? Job security? This was a great app until about 3 updates ago. Now it is far from user friendly, and the latest update in 1/19 has ruined it even more. It crashes and freezes constantly. I expand the map and crash. Hourly is random 6-12hours instead of the 48 hour. Gosh WC, just leave things alone when they work well."
3311,TonyB from MD,"February 10, 2019",1,"Junk app There was a time when I loved this app. It was useful, accurate and easy to read. Now it’s full of pictures and the only words are generally the ads. I like to read the forecast not just see a picture of a snow flake or rain drop. Tell me how much we’ll be getting and other details. I’ve been waiting for the developers to reverse course but I see that’s not happening. Time to delete this junk for a real weather app where I can still “READ” the forecast."
3312,Kissycasi,"February 17, 2019",5,"Better in the beginning After this latest update the app is so slow to load. There’s too much going on causing delays. Simplify the app, we don’t need all the glitz, just a simple and fast loading app to stay informed of the weather."
3313,pkid57,"February 23, 2019",5,Weather App. I enjoy being able to see what the weather is going to be like and to get alerts knowing what kinda storm we are having. It is also nice because I can see how the weather is where we are traveling to

I have rebooted my phone, as well as uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It opens fine once or twice,  then nothing. And I have paid to removed the darn ads twice now too.  Get it fixed will ya?  I cannot be the only one as it has never been an issue before with four different phones. Over it!"

3318,marvw1968rad,"May 6, 2019",1,"Conclusion: money hungry scam app Inaccurate and to be honest, I believe it’s intentional to keep people glued to the app or web site. When forecast calls for a 50% chance of rain or greater for the next 10 days and there’s hardly any.... or the weekend looks like a wash but turns out sunny. Deleting this ridiculous app. Even the radar has become inaccurate for the near future forecasts. What a joke. It’s not even close to “forecasting” the weather. Is that even possible? 10 days in advance? SCAM!"

Every time I get a new generation iPhone I delete there weather app and only use this one. I loved how clear and precise it was.. I’m sad to say, since the update I can’t stand it. Not user friendly at all and much more complicated to understand AND crashes frequently. Super frustrating, I hope they do another update soon."

In northern California, in the midst of the wildfires, with extremely unhealthy air, the app is telling me that it is perfect running weather. On another part of the screen it displays the air pollution PM2.5 at 225 which is unhealthy for everyone.  No mention to stay indoors. No tips or relevant explanations.   For reference, all schools are closed, college and professional sporting events have been rescheduled. Deleting the app."

3325,resident of IL,"December 20, 2018",1,Recent upgrade The upgrade is awful.  I liked having a 10 outlook a quick scroll away.  Also changing cities for upcoming travel was simple and intuitive. The new color scheme is ugly and unappealing and the new layout is also cumbersome and not quick view friendly.  Please go back. I despise the upgrade.  It’s awful. It’s ugly. I don’t like it. I don’t even want to give this one star but if you don’t pick a star you can’t share your review.  So no stars from me.  None! Awful.

But I’m sorry that I did pay because it locks up almost every time I open it. I have to restart my phone to get it to fully open. To me, the developers and marketing people have gone too far and are making a good app worse. Time to replace the staff and get new ones that aren’t greedy."

It was a great app to use, giving information about each day, a nice UI, it was great. That is until today, when suddenly the app no longer opened. I pressed the app, prompting the opening screen, but then it crashed. After a few more fails, I deleted and re-downloaded, same problem. Until there’s another update, I won’t be using this app."
3330,Shmerbie,"September 12, 2018",5,New update I am not thrilled at all with the new update.  It’s to busy and way more complicated to use. I loved the way it was before the update.  Im not a fan of the white background on the daily page either. So many things i don’t like about it :(
3331,olivialuciaa,"September 13, 2018",4,Bring back the UV index The update is just fancy looking. Not a huge fan and this is one of my favorite and most used apps. Why did you get rid of the UV index?? And if you didn’t it’s hidden and needs to be moved to an area that you can see right away. Please bring it back. I need to download another weather app now.
3332,Mytmini,"September 16, 2018",1,"Information overload The new app version tries to put too much information into one screen. I see a squiggly line that has highs and lows over the next 10 days but what I really want to know is whether it’s going to be raining Tuesday morning when I have to go to the airport. Why they think packaging a week of weather in one continuous line is helpful is bewildering to me. Go,back to the day of week presentation with highs, lows, chance of rain and PLEASE, for those of us who run outdoors, add back the humidity!"
3333,Phade0ut,"September 17, 2018",1,"Breaking new things every few weeks This app used to be dependable but its quickly turning into one I “might” look at after looking at a few others.

Thats no longer the case, now i spend a lot of my time re-opening the app after it crashes and listening to ads. Sheeesh"
3334,Mc3cg,"September 17, 2018",1,"Switched to Weather Bug after update It’s such a shame that you’ve changed your app format. It was easy to read and my go to for all weather updates. Now your layout is confusing, very time consuming to view basic information, and full of ads. I switched to Weather Bug which is similar to your old layout. I can quickly open the app and see all updates again. It’s too bad you changed and will deleting your app."
3335,mmf55,"September 18, 2018",5,Mary I have used and appreciated the weather channel app for years. But the most recent changes use fonts and colors that make it difficult to read. Even the icons are lighter and not very easy to distinguish. Please use more contrasting colors. Thank you.
3336,bfeygis,"September 22, 2018",1,Update gone wrong If the sole goal of the update is marketing and to attract more users than it achieved exactly opposite. Too see the same information at a glance I need to make few more clicks and the layout is not as eye friendly as it used to be. In general the trend has been that with every upgrade its becoming less focused on weather vs ads and videos. So I guess if I want just to look up weather I’ll use the app that comes with my phone. It’s much clearer and user friendly.
3337,Cknaack,"September 22, 2018",5,No communication from developer I have sent emails regarding force closes and even the radar app I have sent Multiple emails and not a single reply from any of them .  You don’t reply you should be banned from App Store simple in my books
3338,kamiak00,"September 28, 2018",2,The latest revamp stinks! I don’t know why a perfectly good app feels the need to completely revamp the look and style. This latest version (Late summer 2018) is just a whole lot of space with little information. Gone is the ability to quickly see the typical Hi-Lo precipitation/sunny or cloudy forecast for the day or week. Now you have to scroll through less visually appealing continual graphs. I’m deleting this app after using it for years.
3339,aaocc42,"October 9, 2018",1,"Dangerously inept I had no issues with this app before it was updated/redone. However, the radar is now “off”, and doesn’t always load right away, even with good internet."
3340,Gobucksgal,"August 31, 2018",3,"Not a fan of “reimagined layout” This app used to do just about everything I wanted it to do. Now, it’s difficult to read,and the daily forecast is cluttered with graphs I don't want. The light gray font is too faint & difficult to read on the go. Blue & white was much easier. I liked the 15 day forecast front & center. I’m not here for the videos & “news”. Not sure I’ll keep this app."
3341,Lacytracy,"August 31, 2018",1,"Hate the Update I’ve always really liked this app, but the update is terrible. It’s organized awfully. I liked it when the weather wasn’t just one little section at the top that’s weird to navigate. You also can’t see as many hours in advance of the weather forecast as you used to be able to. At least not that I can find. If it’s still on there then it’s silly that it’s so difficult to navigate that I can’t find it. I want the old version back."
3342,John2664,"September 1, 2018",5,Question about update In the new update I can’t figure out how to manually change locations. My daughter travels and I usually can see the weather in her location as well as the weather info in my location. Help.
3343,malhnmdwyco,"September 1, 2018",1,Bad update!!! The app was great before the update at the end of August 2018. Now it’s extremely slow and the info I want to get to takes far too long to load. I liked when I could scroll down to see what the entire week was going to look like or easily check the next 15 days to setup my plans for a couple weekends from now. Hopefully it gets fixed soon or maybe I will start using a different app because this is too frustrating to use.
3344,Gnomeman,"September 3, 2018",3,Too hard to read I’m really struggling with this new version of the app. It’s difficult to read. It’s all also difficult to maneuver through. The text is too light and too small. I wish I could customize how it appears. I’d like to be able to adjust the color and the size of the text.  Sometimes an upgrade just isn’t better.
3345,Dfc2,"September 3, 2018",5,"Not so good. We have had the weather channel weather app and loved it. This new version is not good. I wish we had a choice to keep the old version. I’m in the App store now looking for a new one. I have to give it one star to send, otherwise it would get none."
3346,rdeemer,"September 4, 2018",1,"Version 10 is a joke wish you could give zero stars I have relied upon this app for years and am more than disappointed with the latest release. This app is of no value when it comes to providing a simple weather forecast. The “ predictions” are a fallacy. There are certain apps that don’t need improvement and this is one of those. Go back to major updates, version 8 or so, and keep it there. Until that happens I will no longer use this app."
3347,Artie_D,"September 5, 2018",4,"Bug with the Apple Watch extension There is a bug that keeps popping up I guess it goes unreported because it’s not relevant to the majority users of the app in US.

I adapt very well, I know here is time to get used to new processes, new ways to do something but this new released app is horrible!

3349,Yemee,"September 10, 2018",1,Change is not always good I opened the app one day last week and it was completely changed. I no longer like this app. The changes were extreme. I now have to stare at my the screen for long periods of time each time to figure out what’s going on for weather. Checking the weather is not suppose to be complicated. It should be a glance at the screen then you can get back to living life. This app visually has way too (too) much going on for each screen.
3350,Seastars8,"May 25, 2018",5,Great app - Is there a problem right now with the app?  I can’t get it to open up and show anything.  I have restarted everything but it isn’t working the last two days.

Please fix this problem!
3353,Luvsudoko,"June 6, 2018",1,"Was better before latest update The newest update requires to much scrolling to find what I want. The last version had everything right there.  If you wanted more details, or the 24 hour forecast, just click on the day.  It also had the “feels like”,  which was useful for figuring out how humid it really is (humidity numbers don’t mean much to me—but knowing it feels 10 degrees hotter does).  My hubby disliked the newest version so much he got rid of it—contemplating doing that myself."
3354,zhansen06,"June 8, 2018",4,"Bad UI The app presents weather with accuracy. However the glaring defect with this app continues to be its UI design. It’s clunky, not well thought out, and doesn’t take advantage of the iPad I’m using it on. The radar feature works well though, unlike the Yahoo weather app. "
3355,waterlu3,"June 10, 2018",1,"From good to bad, I use to love this app and would have given it 5 stars. Now I’m looking for something new to get rid of this. I use to like seeing the 7 day forecast all in a row. Now I have to scroll through which jumps and around lags horribly. Took me a few days to figure out how to get future radar. Who cares about the pass I’ve already lived it. Sometimes I open the app now and it’s just a blank screen and it closes itself. All the improvements you made are just bad!"

3359,SaxMan 83k,"August 30, 2018",1,"Newest format is goofy, will be switching I didn’t totally love the app before, but this latest update is just goofy.  The new layout is bizarre. It’s different but doesn’t give you anything really new or useful.  It takes away an efficient 15 day readout and replaces it with a bad line graph.  Now everything else is cumbersome and you have to go poking around to find the info you want. These guys need to fire their app designer. I will be switching to one of the many other excellent weather apps now."

3364,C Butte,"March 29, 2018",3,I prefer the previous version This updated version is way too cluttered to the point it is actually annoying.  Glad I did not delete the one I had.  I have been using them side by side and while this app is full of information but most of it is overkill.  There are also sneaky links to ads.  Sometimes less is more.
3365,Aikomama420,"April 12, 2018",1,New version is awful I used to love this app. I travel a lot for work and I loved the capability to set different cities and swipe left/right to go back and forth. I hate having to click on the on the search icon and have to select from the drop down. It was also nice when we could scroll the next weeks weather from the very top forecast bar. What used to be a functional quick use app now requires too much scrolling and searching for the basics.
3366,MJK--7555,"April 26, 2018",5,Nice I use the weather app daily. Not only for my home area but I check other areas also. I really like that I can check the weather in places where my family lives or somewhere that I plan to go. A great app to have and I fully rely on it.

But on my iPhone it has somehow locked in to the incorrect local and no matter how many changes I tried it either crashed or returned to the same WRONG location.  Too annoying.  I removed it for now.  2 stars it’s better than local news forecast but I’ll check back in a few weeks.
3368,mjtfrs,"May 17, 2018",5,mjtfrs This app is more on target than the 6:00 news and I don’t have to listen to anything; always on time; always accurate. I use it every day and don’t have to watch other stuff or wait for the weather report.

No more swiping through several different locations.  As a frequent traveler and working with team members around the globe this was the best feature and now it is gone.  Probably still there magically If you pay for it, but not worth the price to even try.   Why do developers keep ruining useful apps."

3375,imagayperson,"January 26, 2020",5,Very good app. The main thing better about this than the standard preloaded weather app is that there is a radar because the standard preloaded weather app gets their forecast from The Weather Channel also but it’s still great.

I have to say, I much prefer the old app.  A quick glance tells you the weather information for the location you have saved.  If you wanted more detail you simply tapped on the day and it opened up an hourly forecast. The new app is all jumbled up and it takes forever to find out what I need to know.

Takes insanely long to load and even when it does it’s riddled with ads and other features that don’t do me any good. For the record I have extremely fast internet at home so my bandwidth is not the problem. I am finally uninstalling it and never going back which makes me sad. It used to be the best weather app out there.

When I turn on alerts it gives me alerts for weather in a city I have never visited nor is it in my saved cities. I have tried to send feedback through the app but that is a fruitless process. So for the time being I will be using other apps for my alerts and will check back to this one after a few upgrades

3464,Tkane80,"March 20, 2020",1,"Not a good app. Usually the app automatically closes out within 5 mins of me opening it. Even with me regularly updating. Especially when I’m looking at radar, which is a big part of why I have the app. Also why did the weather channel remove future snowfall forest maps, I see I can have it if I pay for it, but isn’t it important to know the weather (snowfall) in the future. I mean past snowfall alrdy fell so how useful would that be to a person traveling?"

Now it take 3 times to open it before it will work, all my saved locations and alerts are gone after last update. Update didn’t fix the start up glitch I could have dealt with that but loosing all my info I’ll be looking for a different app today. It was a good 10 year ride but it’s over until you fix things."

In addition, the app now constantly asks you to buy the premium version and is loaded with ads making it far less enjoyable to use. I will be switching to a different app as my go-to source for weather information."
3467,123ddd456,"March 14, 2020",1,Terrible new format As I read the reviews where people are being honest about enjoying the older version with a weeks worth of weather on one screen I agree.  Then I saw the developers response....how arrogant can these people be?!? We tell you what we like and want and you tell us most people enjoy the new version after a few days. Obviously this is wishful thinking because literally no people has said that. Please listen to your customers! We HATE THE NEW UPDATES!
3468,Snakeoiler2,"March 13, 2020",3,"Missing wind data The app is good for general weather use, but it is missing daily wind data. If you want to plan your weekend outdoor activities you would might want to consider rain, temperature, cloud cover and also if it is going to be too windy to have a family picnic, windy enough to go sailing or need to wear a wind breaker to keep from getting cold on that 75 degree sunny day with 15mph winds."
3469,NHL NBA,"March 4, 2020",1,Please This app is not as good as it used to be.  There is no snow option under the outdoor conditions.  Please add that back on the app like the app used to have.  The app also has to many advertisement adds that pops up on the screen from time to time.  Some of the advertisement adds that pop up on the screen from time to time are disgusting and not something I would want to see once and a while.  Please restore the app to how it was when this app first came out.

I loved a quick glance at the weather and the ability to toggle between the current weather and the forecast.  A weather app has to answer two simple questions at least:  what is happening now and what will happen in the figure.  And do it simply and accurately.
3471,Golfbreak18,"February 11, 2020",1,Showtime advertisements preceding weather channels videos. It seems that the weather channel doesn’t have a back bone when it comes to their advertisers. I don’t believe that it’s necessary for women to kiss women and men to kiss man and try to make it appear normal in their showtime trash that they’re showing. It’s not the norm and most of the general public really doesn’t appreciate it. They lost the entire family we’re not interested in watching the weather channel there’s other apps out there.
3472,Turtleguy1984,"February 4, 2020",1,Subscribe over and over ads galore. Recently the weather channel has added a “premium” option. They have also eliminated lots of past functionality and made it only available to premium users ie lightning strikes.

3476,Papper123,"January 12, 2020",1,"Getting worse This used to be the best weather app, but it’s getting bad in a hurry.  It continuously asks if you want to upgrade to premium.  I guess they think you will get sick of being asked and pay for premium. I think I’ll just switch to a different app.  Radar used to give time stamp so you could judge the speed of storms.  Not sure if it’s a bug or not, but latest version doesn’t show any time so you can’t tell where the storms are at a given time."
3477,JSho239872,"January 11, 2020",2,premium for focused forecast 15min forecast!?! I love this app-but was genuinely shocked and disappointed that the 15 minute forecast has been changed to a premium only feature. 
3478,Dab@gr,"January 10, 2020",1,"Never using again I understand that there have to be ads and I’ve always put up with those no problem but now, it is all about going to premium. The absolute most annoying thing is that you go to the map and an ad takes up the lower 3rd while an ad for premium takes up the upper third. Good luck clicking the x to get rid of the premium ad at the top. It doesn’t!! It repeatedly opens the page to sign up for premium. Talk about click-bate!! Buh bye!!"

Completely ridiculous! I also agree with everyone else, the ads are wayyyyy out of hand. Get it together and stop “improving” the app, gets more disappointing with every update. And now with the used to be free 48hr snowfall forecast map being a premium feature, it isn’t even worth it using this app. Look elsewhere."

Gave up and deleted the app.  Switched to Weather bug.  Absolutely found my correct location first time."
3482,dinglenoob,"December 25, 2019",1,Stripping away features to force purchase Used this app for years now and loved it. Recently they added a subscription based enhanced version of the app that gave you extended dates for radar and other extra not needed features. Now they have removed time stamps from the radar screen and rain precipitation chance from daily weather report. Those are the primary features people use the app. Uninstalling and finding another app. Disgusting practice.
3483,hahahahagreat,"December 2, 2019",1,"Pop up ads freeze app 9 times out of 10 this app refuses to open to anything other than a blue screen with a white bar at the bottom. The pop up ads that advertise the Premium edition end up compromising the app loading. I am not someone who usually writes reviews, but after so many updates that were supposed to fix the problem failing, I will say don’t  waste your time on the free version. A frozen app is not a way to get users to upgrade to premium."
3484,Roberto unique nickname,"November 27, 2019",1,"Latest update is bad. Accuweather is much better The latest update makes the advertisements occupy 2/3 of the screen and the actual weather information that is the reason to have the app in the first place has been crammed down into a small section at the bottom of the screen.  Also, the video stories are fictitious scare mongering stories of doom that have been used as click bait to increase advertising revenue since the dawn of the Internet.  App deleted."
3485,Bootigs,"November 26, 2019",5,Go to app My favorite app for weather news.  Forecasts are accurate and the videos well done.  I bought the app because I don’t want to be bothered by ads when I want weather info. It loads well for me.  I like the notifications.

I am sad to say that if there is no resolution to this I will be forced to delete the app and look for something different."

From rain to no rain... sunny to cloudy... cool to hot and humid... they honestly have no clue as to what kind of day today, tomorrow or the next day will be like...The 10 day forecast is the same every day (ex:  partly cloudy with a 40% chance of rain) ALWAYS off!!  I think they just spin a wheel and go with whatever it says....Hilarious!"

They are not concerned at all with the customer experience and the value of getting the weather when you need it."

The app takes longer than any of my others to open regardless of WiFi or cell service. Also the future radar use to be my favorite feature and seems to be less and less accurate.

Can't you just go back to a version that functioned? I just want the weather in a non-bloated, non-location tracking and selling sort of way. I don't mind a little ad at the bottom of a page of useful info. But what you got now is crap. Your mobile app gives your brand a bad name. Consider hiring some developers who test products before widespread release."

Ridiculous."

It will get stuck on the opening screen and force closing it doesn’t do anything. Letting it run doesn’t do anything. It’s pretty useless when you need to document temperatures or check forecasts and you can’t see the weather. Particularly frustrating because I paid to remove ads

Very disappointed, I am going to have to find a different app sadly. I used to brag this was the best one when people pulled up anything different, now I can’t do that."
3511,Becky301888,"October 22, 2018",1,Bad since update This was my favorite app. Now I feel it has become click bait to keep me engaged longer. Harder to see the tiny lines and determine the current weather and forecast. You have to click on what you want to see instead of just being able to see it. Won't use until next update to see if improved. It is easier to search for the local weather than use this app after the update.

Guess what?  We had no rain this afternoon.  As for now, your blurb write “snow will continue”. The lake is heavy with fog, so maybe the drizzle we have now, will freeze while falling.....but I don’t think that is called snow.  It might become sleet, or grapple but right now it is just a cold yuck.  You need a better computer model for this area."

I’ve yet to hear back after several days and I’m still seeing adds.  Now the “Remove Adds” button no longer works. I guess I’ll be looking for a different weather app.

Difficult to watch with text covering the entire video and most videos are far from the description baiting someone in to watching them. The graph is useless.

Do I need a sweater if I’m going out in the morning? A raincoat or umbrella? How will driving be? Now, in order to find out that type of basic info, I have to get to multiple screens."

After using the app for 3 days, (actually I figured it out in the first five minutes of using the new update) I’ve decided it was awful. I’ve never written a review and was so surprised when I got on and read all the negative reviews feeling quite vindicated, so good to know I wasn’t crazy. I doubt they care enough to change anything. I have deleted my app and finding another one for all the reasons mentioned in the other reviews. So long WC...."

This has always been my go to weather app. So far, my iPad hasn’t updated to this horrible mess so I at least have that for now. My husband is a software engineer and he even said the platform is hard to navigate and poorly done! We’re both tech savvy so it has nothing to do with that. Fix the horrible update to something useful again!"
3537,Samantha Hey!,"September 6, 2018",1,"Why have they ruined this app? The Weather Channel was my go-to app for the weather. It was accurate, had all the features I was looking for in a weather app, and it was easy to use. Now, it’s impossible to read, has a million ads, and doesn’t even show the UV index anymore?! If it does, I certainly can’t find it. I don’t understand why they changed it to whatever garbage it is now, because it definitely isn’t functional whatsoever. Bye Weather Channel😑"

I thought it was me because I have glasses, but my niece with perfect eye sight also has difficulty reading it. I’ve been using the app for years. You didn’t need to change what worked very well and was easy to read. I’m sure you could have added features and made things faster without making it impossible for those of us over 40 to read it."

I am now looking for a weather app that is less complicated."

If you are looking at weather conditions more then 30:00 minutes out, a magic 8 ball is more reliable. Heavy ads slow everything down and maps take forever to load.

This is unnecessary and wakes me up in the middle of the night."

Repeated this process a few times until I had to delete app bc the alerts wouldn’t stay off.  Sorry weather channel.  Until this bug is fixed I’ll get my weather elsewhere

I’m tired of hearing everyone blasting their opinions, whether I agree with them or not, in every aspect of our lives. This is why we are divided!

This new radar obstructs view and lags."
3564,Mudcat06,"April 22, 2020",1,"the worst I work with weather as a career..... track storms, etc. This is honestly the WORST prediction app you could ever use. I’m sure all you do is relay information from the NWS, but for users that want accurate data.... you need to download the local apps from the cities you’re in. Some are lazy and will use the same data.... but others will actually invest in doing their own rewatch. Good luck.... if you’re relying on this, you’re better off licking a finger and sticking it in the air. Promise"

I’ve turned off all notifications within the app and it continues to send them anyways. I’ve written to the support team and nobody ever responded. Guess it’s time to find a New weather app."

Now they want $30 per year to stop the ads and to display the same content they used to. If they want to charge for their app, that’s fine, but don’t charge, change the rules, then charge again. This app is getting deleted and I’ll look for another weather program."

I preferred it over Apple weather... but then I updated the app in Feb 2020 and I am about to uninstall it. The ads are obnoxious- loading right as you are about to click something, and instead you end up clicking the ad. The ads cause refreshing issues so you have to do your desired action twice to get your result. And then to top it all off, randomly a full screen ad will appear. "

The app will not load - cannot get past the Privacy screen telling you to scroll down - then hit Continue. Nothing but the spinning wheel. I canceled my subscription and deleted the app. I may be out $10 but they’ll never get another cent out of me. Better options out there that have more respect for your privacy. They have proved they cannot be trusted to provide the service I paid for.
3577,Averyeyes,"December 27, 2019",4,Premium I paid for the premium app when it first came out years ago.  You canceled that and forced everyone to take/use your non-premium app.  Now you asking if we/I want “Premium” again.

I have deleted it and will no longer use it."

After the most recent update there is no longer radar prediction. I’m sure it is available with the premium service, but I am unwilling to pay for it. They kept my family safe for FREE.

I come to it for the simple reason of weather and related info. I am far less inclined to open it knowing I’ll have to endure ads to see video coverage. I can read the local noaa forecast discussion to get the most accurate weather relative to my location and not be force-fed irrelevant ads.

Not so with this app. Despite paying for the channel on television, you’re forced to watch ads before the video segments in the app, and I’ve experienced this even between EACH AND EVERY VIDEO CLIP.  So, I’m removing the app and will rely on the plethora of other Wx apps available - and if I want weather videos, I’ll turn on the television."

It’s very irritating."
3598,Angrymonkeymermaid,"June 23, 2019",1,"Displaying wrong Temps How can it be 84 degrees on the daily forecast, if on the hourly forecast it shows the highest will be 82 degrees? The lowest and highest temperatures from the hourly forecast do not reflect what the daily forecast is. It is like that in many towns not just one. Therefore, it is giving the wrong temperature data. Since this app is all about accurate weather data, but giving the wrong information, i give it 1 star until fixed. Wrong info means app does not work properly."
3599,(Chiefterrymadden),"June 22, 2019",3,Just what I thought! Having the ads even though I paid to be rid of them I see why they are doing it. They want more money. It’s never enough!

Three stars is being generous.

When it (rarely) loads, there are so many bugs and glitches, it’s useless. I also agree with another reviewer that the teeny, tiny icons used to “describe” the weather are worthless. They’re so small I can barely tell what they are, and there is no ability to zoom in on them. I’m so disappointed in what this app has become."

It crashes or never loads about half the time. It is pretty much the only app I have that does this. When it works, I like it. I prefer it over other weather apps for its news content, but if I actually want to see the radar or find out what the weather forecast is, I have to use a different app b/c this app can’t be depended on to work."

I’ve decided I need to find another. Now when you open the app the current Temp is so small you can barely see it. Generally speaking, updates can take a bit to get used to, but are, for the most part, an improvement once you get past the learning curve. It’s not happening with this new format. So, so long until you come to your senses!"

If I close the app I cannot reopen it no matter what. It used to reopen after rebooting my phone. Now I have to uninstall it, then reinstall and restore purchases to open it. If you close it with an accidental swipe you get to start over. I’ve contacted support with nothing but an automated response. No fun."

Quite frustrating to use now."

This graph is harder to decipher.  Found the older app much easier to use

Temperatures are also gradient and rainfall is also a color gradient. This means you can only read one information set at a time. Also the ten day forecast is removed from storm radar app and only available in the TWC weather app. Now I need to use two apps to read the full weather. You’ve lost a dedicated customer.

Started with it because it was what I watched on TV, stayed with it because I’m a creature of habit and had no reason to go. But now I do. A full page ad just took over the screen saying, “Sorry to bother you” Then continued to bother me with their ad. There are plenty of weather apps out there. I don’t need this one. Besides, they’re getting less and less accurate."
3736,SchoolHouse4,"October 21, 2018",1,"Hate ads. No option to remove. The ads take up about 1/4 of the view with no option to remove them. I hate ads. The app itself is hard to make heads or tales of. Seems like everything just runs and blends in together. The new “clean” look that seems to be permeating everything is too sterile. Apps and such need some definition to help the eyes make sense of the situation. Otherwise it looks like a mess, which is ironic considering it’s the “clean” look."

I was unable to submit the review without rating at least one star. The review process forces a person to rate it. This app is not even deserving of one star. The original app was more viewer friendly and easier to navigate and read. Graphs are not necessary when displaying the low/high of the day. I don’t need analytics for the day. Extremely unsatisfied.

3741,Please make full version,"September 3, 2018",1,New version is terrible Their newest version is terrible. If you go to the hourly forecast it tells you the forecast six hours ago. News flash I don’t need to know what the weather WAS I want to know what it will be. This version the hourly only goes out 14 hours as opposed to the previous which went out about 30 hours. But in their defense they were usually wrong anyway so I guess why bother posting it that far when they can’t get it right hour to hour.
3742,Go back to the older versions,"September 4, 2018",1,Need to change it back This is the worst updat they have made to this app. It used to be the best out there and now you can’t find anything easy.

Now there was an update and none of us know or care to figure out how to use it. Why did it change and become so hard to use? I have deleted and found an easier one to use. That’s crazy because I have heard people at work say the same thing. What did they do to this??? I have not heard one person like it. What a shame."

3745,Gassy mike,"September 13, 2018",1,"You’ve ruined this app I’m generally not resistant to change.  But this app is so bad it is no longer worth using....it’s clunky and the presentation is poor.  The writers need to reinstate the old version and preferably leave the way it was.  If you feel the need to change the perfectly good app, you need to start over because you failed miserably.  If I could rate this with zero or negative stars I would.  I have never rated any app, but this is so bad I couldn’t keep quiet about it."
3746,Tttfox,"September 14, 2018",1,2 thumbs down for 10.0 The new version is completely frustrating and I’ve gone to other apps until this hopefully gets fixed. The white background is terrible and the wavy line is not easy to read like daily forecasts in their daily box. It’s like weather data was vomited all over this app. The only good thing is the radar button you can get to without scrolling. Please bring back the option of the older version!
3747,tc.crown.55,"September 16, 2018",1,Latest update Really dislike the latest update. Difficult to define what info goes with which day. The background is all the same. Very little to distinguish or separate the data. 
3748,Casey2715,"September 16, 2018",1,"Latest app update I used to like this app. I liked the easy to get to hourly information. I also liked the 15 day forecast to see the trend.

I also cannot quickly access my children’s cities. Very very disappointed with this app. Looking for a new app. Two thumbs down!"

3758,Mincepie007,"August 31, 2018",2,No longer showing 15 day forecast You just updated your app with all of this new junk and you removed the one feature I depended on the most. The 15 day forecast was easy to look at and see how the next two weeks were going to be approximately. I suffer from weather related medical condition so being forewarned is required. I guess I will be finding a new less junky app that has the basics.

3761,Incufreak411,"May 3, 2018",1,The most inaccurate app ever. It is never accurate on rain. I own a landscaping business and depend on their predictions. Within an hour yesterday it went from a 90% chance down to 15% “with storms in sight” that never showed up at all. One time about a year ago I waited for a mega storm for THREE DAYS and it never came. I obviously got in the wrong business because I cannot name another position where you can be that wrong so consistently. Don’t waste your time on this app.
3762,Solon212,"May 15, 2018",2,"mediocre at best This is more a downgrade than an upgrade.  The Now and forecast buttons are now gone, which was a fast way to check the weather at various locations.

Rarely does it get tomorrow’s forecast accurate but a week ago it didn’t get that same day’s forecast accurate.  It had been misting and raining all day at my location and I pulled up the WC app to see when the rain would end.  Honestly, it was showing 0% chance of rain for that same day.  I can determine the weather more accurately by flipping a coin!"

I also get warnings and notices for locations almost 2 hours from where I am.  I hate the adds before every video but that’s just the way the app has been and I guess will stay.
3852,RMT1015,"September 2, 2018",2,Disappointed with changes Wonder why companies with successful apps feel the need to fix what’s not broken. This used to be my go to weather app. Now you have to sort through graphs and video to try to find what you are looking for. 
3853,DallasReview,"September 3, 2018",2,"New update After the new update, the app is no longer user friendly. Keeping it simple and accurate was the reason I downloaded it- not for the videos/educational information. Maybe keep them in a separate spot and keep the daily, 5 day, 15 day and radar in the forefront. Hoping a new update will bring it back to where it used to be and if not, I will be deleting!"

3855,no longer a TWC app junkie,"September 6, 2018",1,"Deleted the app after a decade of loving it I ended up deleting the app today after years of complete satisfaction.  Upgrade hardly ever opened, would stay spinning on the blue screen forever, phone got hot, battery visibly drained, app hard to use when did open, wouldn’t allow me to add locations.  I’d even paid for the yearly subscription for no ads, but the app is just unworkable.  Really disappointing “upgrade”.  I hope a working version is forthcoming.  Good luck.  Bye."
3856,Brax07,"September 6, 2018",1,So disappointed. This used to be my #1 App:( I am utterly crushed by the new format!!  I live by your App!!! The gray writing on the white background is so difficult to read and I hate not being able to see all the highs and lows for the week in one screen. I like the new menu at the bottom but seriously gray on white??? What were you thinking?! It is nearly impossible to read outside in daylight. Have to switch to another weather app  until you fix this!!😩
3857,Neroburns,"September 7, 2018",1,"So disappointed 0 Stars I used this app everyday and the latest updated version is just awful. What were you guys thinking? You could at least give us the option to use the previous version. This is so unfriendly to the eye and overloaded with adds. I get it, you need the adds for business but not at the expense of users experience. The iPhone version that comes with the phone is better than this. I’m looking for a new app. You guys lost me."
3858,Secan3,"September 8, 2018",2,"Update disappointing I am a heavy user of this app.  Although the update seems to perform better, I do not like it as a user.  The appearance is cluttered and the white background with small gray font is difficult to read at a glance.  Navigation is inconsistent and I can’t get what I want.  I am starting to use a different weather app in the hopes that Weather Channel will soon release another version that is visually appealing."
3859,Ksrbirdlady,"September 8, 2018",5,It Takes a Lot.... ....for me to take the time to review an app/product.  But I would actually feel guilty not rewarding the developers of this update by staying silent.  Cannot imagine what more you could ask for in a weather app - AND it’s free.  Thank you!

3861,Jeanniepat,"August 28, 2018",5,Jean in Iowa We use this app when we travel. We especially like using the radar wherever we go. Getting the weather by the hour makes it easy to decide what clothes to wear and if you need an umbrella or snow shovel in your car.
3862,Fleeb10,"August 29, 2018",2,"Every upgrade/re-design... ...is worse than the last. You took something easy to use (I liked the “circle” that you could spin for more info) and keep making it  less user friendly, and less pleasing to the eye."
3863,Cat Lady from Willowick,"August 30, 2018",1,"New app has a horrible interface I hate the new design, I want to see what is coming up for the day and the week at a quick glance with a readable interface. Tap on a day and see more details, not this chart.  Also, you made the print so light it is unreadable for older folks and others with vision impairment with no accessiblikity options.  I will be cancelling my no ads subscription.  Your prior version had a lot of contrast with the dark blue and white and larger print."
3864,ccarlisle20,"August 30, 2018",1,"Disappointed I do not like the update. It wasn’t broken so I’m not sure why you thought you had to fix it. We had a significant weather alert in my area today. I got the alert but when I opened the app to see exactly where the storm was going to hit, the alert was not there. Before, any warnings/watches/alerts were scrolling across the top. I’ll try it for a few more days to see if it grows on me but if not, I’ll look for another weather app."
3865,789silly,"August 30, 2018",1,"Horrible Update. Visual Disaster. I rarely if ever leave app feedback, but this update is a downgrade in my book. Visually difficult to see (light font on white background is just useless outdoors), wasted space, and unnecessarily cumbersome. Shortcut buttons in the bottom could be nice touches, but there’s nothing to this update that makes me ever want to use it again. I’ll check in for a new update every once in a while after this, but my Weather Channel app days are over."
3866,citation680,"August 30, 2018",3,Don’t like the new layout The new layout has all the same data it’s just harder to take a quick glance to see what the weather will be like for the next few days.

3868,cloudtoucher,"August 31, 2018",2,"New update is awful! No longer can I see 5 days at a glance—have to swipe  and swipe and swipe. Now they show the highs and lows in a series of undulating waves, which is superfluous. Who doesn’t know temps rise and fall over 24 hours? "

I’m going to find a new weather app. I downloaded your app over a year ago because I trusted the “Weather Channel” brand, but it’s less and less usable for getting daily and 10-day weather reports. Don’t like the new formats, not as helpful and usable. You made it fancier and pretty- but useless. I want solid data presented in easy to read formats that I can access quickly and reliably."

Really guys, you can't put the date there among all the foo foo stuff?"
3871,MimiBike,"May 23, 2018",2,"Old iPad version was much better Yes, the app still gives weather info, but visually the old version was easier to see the whole week, ability to swipe between multiple cities without going in to search was better, and the location of buttons to look deeper (radar etc) was much more user friendly.

3873,glamint,"June 1, 2018",1,Not happy with this version Forced to change to this version and it is truly awful. I have used the weather channel app for years but this one takes forever to load and information is scattered. They are trying to do too much on one page and do not have the underlying software savvy to handle all the graphics. I will be switching apps until they get it right. Perhaps way too much advertising on one page is ruining it?
3874,justinbeau56,"June 3, 2018",1,"Iphone 8 Does NOT work! Whenever i open the app, it comes on for a split second, then closes. Ive updated it to the latest version but still has these issues. Also whenever it actually DOES work, when i open it it forces my music app to close. This is very annoying. Also the radar never seems to accurately depict what the thumbnail for it shows. These issues need to be fixed in order for me to ever give this app more than 1 star."
3875,Krissn333,"June 6, 2018",2,"Future radar never shows anything For several updates now, the future radar never shows any precipitation. It is actively storming here and I pulled up the future radar to see how long it might be expected to last. It shows nothing. Past radar shows the storm materializing and shows it here.

I hate that there isn’t an image associated with the current weather- I liked the cloud/storm/sun graphics at the top for easy glances. There are far too many places to click and swipe instead of everything being streamlined on the same page. I hope you readjust to accommodate user preferences and modernization."

The UI of the old app is much simpler... view five days at a glance, scroll to see another five, tap a day to see its details. Plus, it could store 11 locations. The new app requires more scrolling and tapping, and looks more cluttered. Plus, it remembers only five locations, whose order changes as they’re accessed. Not impressed!"

3897,Samuel Haskins,"February 9, 2020",4,Needs a better way to determine what the temperature feels like outside Good weather app. Only suggestion I have to make this app better is to implement a system like Accuweather’s “RealFeel” temperature to give us a more accurate representation of what the temperature feels like outside.

Also the color on the update for favorites is very pale and hard to read. The previous format was easier and more physically pleasing to look at.   I have also started getting weather alerts for random cities, and have no clue where they are. "
3938,TAMUMaggie,"April 6, 2019",2,Not user friendly I have used the Weather Channel app for years. I am now switching to another weather app to try it out. I have been very unhappy with the new updates in the past year. I dislike the white background with the the line graph showing the temperature. The radar map has not worked as well as it did before the major change too.

I actually deleted this app from my phone and found another app to use, but I still think it’s very accurate and check back on it from time to time. But when you upgraded probably at least a year ago you destroyed it. Made it entirely and user-friendly And hard to read. Bring back simplicity and stop reimagining things!"

Not only does this app not open for me half the time, but it’s a horrible lay out when it does. Too much white, too many little lines. My family likes (liked!) to use it daily for a quick morning check before getting ready for school. Takes too much time now to get the needed info to even make it worth it. So bummed they changed it."

I’ve downloaded a different weather app which I find reliable and easy to navigate. What The Weather Channel has done is taken a perfectly good user-friendly app and turned it into a nuisance. I kept it to see if the changes would grow on me. They definitely have not. A no-go for me! ✌🏼

Totally disappointed with the “improvements” made to this app.  You can’t beat simplicity and it seems that they’ve managed to clutter way too much stuff on the screen.  Too much going on at once.  Have to navigate through too much just to get the basics. Shame. Used to think that The Weather Channel was the authority on weather and the standard that others were measured by.

It’s full of stuff that I might like if I was given an option to click for more or the ability to change in settings. Your old app will still work regards of the pop ups that appeared. This one is so so so bad. I can’t even explain. Do NOT delete the old version! You will regret it."

Not knowing the UV index is very dangerous. I’ll be deleting this to look for a better app now. So disappointed. Why break something that isn’t broken?
4179,RitaMarC,"October 21, 2018",1,Awful update Really bad idea the way they updated this app. This is the first app I used to open since the apps were invented. Now  searching for a new weather app. 
4180,Danalogic,"September 12, 2018",1,"Terrible update makes it difficult to quickly find the forecast you’re looking for The most recent update breaks the weather down into chunks you never knew you never wanted!  It’s difficult to quickly see the 5 day forecast without extra information.  If I wanted AM and PM information for a day, I’d click on it.  The information may be helpful but the display of it is difficult to read and distracting to the eyes."

4183,blndhoneygram,"September 16, 2018",1,"New update As a visually impaired person, the new update is horrible. There is not enough contrasts between the background and the words.  They blend in with each other. I feel this was not well thought out."
4184,roan615,"September 16, 2018",1,"Takes forever to load Every time I open the app, it doesn’t load the information I need. There are way too many ads that are taking up space and preventing the useful content from being readily visible. Please, Weather Channel, clean up your app. And there is ZERO consistency in the info provided. Sometimes the hourly forecast is at the top, sometimes is the daily forecast. I can never find what I’m looking for and it’s infuriating."
4185,OctoberMoon83,"September 18, 2018",2,"HATE the update This was my favorite weather app for years. It was more accurate I felt than other apps, and was easy to use. The reception update about a month ago though is TERRIBLE. It’s no longer easy to find my way around the app. It looks terrible and I’m honestly considering finding another app unless they have another update where they change this new horrendous design."
4186,schneijt,"September 18, 2018",1,"Used to be great, but now it’s garbage. This app used to be easy to navigate, opened properly almost every time, and was overall the best weather app in my opinion.  Now after at least two release versions of the new layout, it still doesn’t open more than half the time, the navigation isn’t intuitive the way Apple meant for navigation to work on iOS, and the quality of the app is just laughably bad now.  What a shame..."
4187,Trumpet voice,"September 18, 2018",2,"New update 👎 Do not like the new update at all. It doesn’t have a smooth flow and much more difficult to navigate. I get the necessity to give something a “new look” but not when it makes it unnecessarily complicated and not as user friendly.  The info is still there (thus the 2 stars instead of 1), but have to navigate more to find what I need.  I just want a simple weather app."
4188,dragonmomtoo,"September 18, 2018",1,Local alerts Love the look of the new update but you need to fix the bugs. I am no longer getting alerts for my area. When I go to try and turn them back on it will not let me. I have even gone in and selected my current location as a favorite as the app instructions said to do.  So much for knowing about a severe thunderstorm warning I was in until I looked outside. It ridiculous that the National alerts work but not local.
4189,Sexysybil,"September 20, 2018",1,"This app went downhill with the latest update I am deleting this app! I have ALWAYS liked the weather channel app, but since the upgraded it, it is not intuitive, and I hate that I can’t find a longer range forecast than 3 days. When you look at the temperature for three days, you have to scroll to The side and it doesn’t have any indicator of what day your on."
4190,MrsSewNSewJSC,"September 3, 2018",5,"💕🧚🏽‍♂️ I absolutely love the new changes to the Weather App. I need to check the weather frequently and see the radar, with the new buttons along the bottom I’m able to do it faster."
4191,Jakepitt15,"September 3, 2018",1,"Bring back the old format Why would you make an update that makes something harder and more frustrating. It’s almost impossible to find any information but the temperature, and when you try to see more it just takes you to a survey. You clearly were collecting data on the UV index, why is that not readily available. Everything else is hidden throughout the new format. App went from great to terrible overnight!"
4192,Leastun,"September 4, 2018",2,"Update is terrible I’ve had this app for years and they just recently did an update that is terrible. Hard to see the current temperature, so many ads flooding across the screen, so much various information junking it up that it’s hard just to see what the temperature is and what it’s going to be for the rest of the day. Deleting the app and using a new one starting today."
4193,CrystalShine33,"September 5, 2018",2,"What did you do This update is neither pleasing to the eye nor easy to navigate. Also, I used the UV index very often and it would be nice to have it back. I’m not really sure what you did to this app, but it really needs to be fixed. It’s terrible. It shouldn’t take me more than 5 minutes to check the weather, I have things to do. The way it was was simple and 1000 times better"
4194,Kendragon_,"September 6, 2018",1,UV Index Gone Hey idiots. Some of the population is actually intelligent and would like to know the UV rating throughout the day. Skin cancer is a big issue and I’m missing an extra safety precaution I used frequently. Bring it back. 
4195,Tin Whiskers,"September 6, 2018",1,"Update Horrible I gave the update a day or two to get used to it but alas, I cannot stand being on the app for longer than a few seconds. Information is hard to get and all I want to know is what the temperature is/what it actually feels like, and the UV levels for the day. I couldn't find the UV levels for the day, and it’s a headache getting expected temperatures for the next few days. Looking for something else to use and deleting this app."
4196,dfreshhtown,"September 6, 2018",1,"Disappointing Upgrade I have used The Weather Channel App almost on a daily basis for years.  Loved it, well made, fast, and reliable.  The recent upgrade is simply AWFUL.  It is slow, clunky, and quite frankly just terrible.  TWC, listen to your customers.  Instantly send an update so we can revert back to the old version.  For future releases, keep near the same and enhance if you like.  However, don’t make it ugly and NEVER slow it down again, please!"
4197,Lynniemini,"September 8, 2018",2,Improved app needs improvement I find the background screen being white makes it harder on the eye to view the weather icons especially in the hourly forecast. I preferred the blue background in the last version.  
4198,Chloe94773,"September 11, 2018",1,Dislike New Version I check the weather app a lot an I don’t like this new version at all. It’s mainly white and the little weather icons are hard to see. The wavy lines are not necessary. The only thing I like is the little menu down at the bottom where you can tap if you want to see radar or whatever rather than scrolling down like you used to do. Please bring back the color and take away all this white stuff and wavy lines.
4199,Melismar,"September 12, 2018",1,"Confusing Used to be very simple, user friendly, exactly what you need when you want to see the current weather for now, hour by hour, and days onward. This new update is not easy to follow nor is it user friendly. I used to like that everything I needed was right there and in enough detail to understand (unlike the basic Apple weather app). I always referred to this app. After this update, I’m finding a new weather app to use."

4201,mylittleaussie,"July 30, 2018",3,Cannot set location alerts This would be a great app except when I go to set my alerts it asks for location.  Problem is it isn’t giving me choices in my location to choose while setting alerts.  I have my location turn on and app permissions allowed.  Will delete if can’t get my alerts.
4202,DrillbitTailor,"August 8, 2018",3,Molasses in January The app is now super slow to load and hard to scroll through. I suspect it is because it is so loaded with videos and ads that it can’t run. 
4203,SusanDino,"August 29, 2018",1,A TERRIBLE APP 🙁 I do not even want to give this app any stars at all.  I wish I had been presented with the option for the update rather than having it forced upon me.  The former app was working perfectly.  It was simple and at a glance very easy to read.  I am seeing that other reviewers agree about being very unsatisfied with this update.  I am hoping that with an outpouring of negative reviews the TWC app developer will just return to the former app which was working fine.
4204,Georgia Bulldog Fan,"August 29, 2018",4,"Love it! I love the convenience of having the Weather Channel app on my phone! It is more accurate than our local channels, and offers more. I love the option to find out weather where other family and loved ones reside. It’s great during bad weather as well. Love it!!!!!"
4205,Carrie On,"August 29, 2018",1,"New Design is Horrible Bring back the old App design. I can’t find the Current Temp, the Feels Like Temp, Sunset/Sunrise Time, and other current specific weather details that I went to this App for. We may have to BREAK UP and stop seeing each other unless you meet my needs like you did before. You’ve changed, man. You’re not the same App that I’ve been “with” all these years and it hurts my heart. Tough decisions may be forthcoming about our future together"
4206,MamaWheels,"August 30, 2018",1,This could be better The new update isn’t that great. Nothing has been added and it’s actually a bit more clumsy to use. The daily “temperature rollercoaster” is really distracting and unnecessary. The color of the temperature number and precipitation icons should be darker so it’s easier to see. My eyes just focus on the rollercoaster which isn’t telling me anything. Maybe highlight it if there’s gonna be a 50° chance but the daily up and down is no need for alarm.
4207,Ms_Hecubus,"August 31, 2018",1,"Awful redesign The new update takes the ease out of checking the daily weather and throws way too much information at you in a hard to read format. The graphs make it difficult to decipher quickly, and let’s not even discuss the mess that is the weekly format!  Do we really need a dizzying wavy line above the high/low forecast (now in a confusing side-by-side layout!)?  This has gone from the only weather app I use to getting deleted."
4208,Andygirl59,"September 3, 2018",2,"Done with it! I have been using this app since it’s inception.  Each new version has gotten worse and worse. More and more distractions added. I just want the weather, radar and alerts. I can get the other stuff by watching weather channel on tv!  This latest version is the worst and takes FOREVER to load it’s useless garbage. I’m finally deleting it for good and moving on."
4209,Darrenblan,"September 3, 2018",1,"Awful Redesign Based upon my feelings about the update and the vast majority of the recent reviews, I can positively say that you will lose users.  I cannot believe that the Weather Channel management team released the redesigned format without doing any voice of customer studies at every stage of development.  This version is a disaster. Not only is it a ridiculous looking format, but it is hard to read and navigate.  Poor management will always result in loss of revenue."

I hate using this app and I am fed up 😡😡😡😡 and it’s awful that I can’t even use a nickname that hasn’t already been used stating how ticked I am . You should be ashamed at yourselves.

It just stays at the start screen with the wheel spinning as if its like ok’ing for my location. It doesn’t move from that screen and the location arrow that should be black to find my location doesn’t stay. Please fix it soon. Whatever was in the most recent update makes it unusable. 😢
4216,Rileyboy02,"May 25, 2018",5,Frustrating I have had this app for a long time and have always loved it.  The latest update has rendered it useless.  I only get the opening page with a spinning circle.  So miss a working weather app
4217,Mi The Great,"May 25, 2018",1,"Radar feature is awful The previous version had radar that was sharper than anything on TV (local on the 8s)... and I loved the ability to see the last few hours and notice how storms developed. The new radar barely works and is as bad as the local one on TV. Plus, too many things on home page now. Why change what was working perfectly before? Future radar is just as bad. Unreliable and inconsistent."
4218,aviator pete,"May 28, 2018",1,"Not as good as the previous app!! I definitely don’t like it as much as the previous app!! The last one was much easier to navigate through. I had around 15 different cities save in my part of the state and l could quickly check out their current hourly and ten day forecasts. To me the the new one is much more cumbersome to use. Frankly I don’t use the weather channel app for radar. I have much better apps for that, such as my my radar pro!"
4219,Beeboperin,"June 16, 2018",1,"The App No Longer Works This app is fantastic when it will actually work. Unfortunately, it’s been several months since it has worked. I still get push notifications for lightning, rain, severe weather alerts, etc but as for the app itself? Nada. Just the Weather Channel logo and the spinning loading circle. As much as I hate it, I’m going to have to find another app to use for my weather info until this is resolved."

Please bring back the locations list!"

And don’t get me started on the monthly subscription model that you push pop up ads for every time I open it. If I could go back to the other version I would. Look at the reviews within the last year and you will see that the majority of users don’t like it.

Very frustrating. Glitchy and I’m upset to have paid for a subscription I don’t have access to 100% of the time.
4230,Mom6loveselmo,"March 10, 2020",2,"Feel ripped off I have been a weather channel app user for years. Then they came out with a paid version that stated it was for life.

Frustrating."

4235,DonnaThomas,"January 29, 2020",2,More & more ads Why do the updates continually put in more & more ads within the app’s screens?

This just makes me not want to use your ad anymore.

Guess I’ll have to shop for a new weather App."

If I wanted political propaganda I would watch CNN. I just want to know the weather. The new app is terrible I miss just having the weather easily accessible. I am a farmer and I just want to see the forecast and the likelihood of rain. The new app makes it more difficult to find information like that. I will have to find another app.
4261,tunafry,"March 5, 2019",5,Best prediction ever This is the most important is that it is usually accurate and a great way to look at future rain that would come our way in Escondido California thanks for updating this app I really do enjoy this and it’s good to stay informed
4262,GWS816,"March 11, 2019",4,Needs a bug fix My only complaint is I have to turn my phone off and on daily for this app to work. This is the only app that stops working until I restart my phone. Then it works fine all day and maybe the next day.
4263,ClearAsDay2Mar,"March 22, 2019",5,Weather Channel Review I have always enjoyed watching the Weather Channel on TV until my cable channel discontinued the service. It is nice to know that I can still have it on my phone and when I visit my mom in Louisville.
4264,pbhan,"March 25, 2019",3,"App freezes a lot I like the weather channel app and use it very frequently. But since couple of weeks it is freezing on me and to make it work I have to hard close the app. Sometimes that works, but couple of times I have seen no matter how many tomes I hard close it, it still freezes."
4265,LGC60,"March 31, 2019",2,Still not working Radar stopped working as well location and always having to re-remove adds after the original purchase. Accuracies have been off and on with temp and weather. Alerts are also not working properly....Need more accurate forecasts for this app as well to work properly especially for a paid version.
4266,crytothegods,"March 31, 2019",4,New weather app Not a huge fan of the current weather app. I liked the old way better. One thing I would like to see is rain and or snow fall totals for my area from the last 24hrs and other areas where I might have family or friends.
4267,Avocado_reviewer,"April 5, 2019",4,"Wow!! This app is amazing! The notifications I enabled tell me the exact time each storm will happen. I love that I can see the radar of rain,snow, and mixed! The temperature on this app is very accurate, even how the temperature feels! I advise anybody who wants an accurate weather app to get this app, the weather channel!"
4268,Shearpin,"May 7, 2019",5,Weather Channel review My favorite parts of the weather channel app are the videos and I can look several days ahead as to what the weather may be. This allows me to make plans ahead of time.
4269,jmfalcon1,"May 7, 2019",2,"Hot Trash More often than not, the app doesn’t open properly. When it does, the poor design makes it difficult to find the information I want, and it’s loaded with advertisements. I’ve never let such an awful app stay on my phone for so long. One star for being an app, one star for having accurate weather information... when I can find it."
4270,B3a1c22,"October 31, 2018",1,"New Update is Horrible- bring back the last version I have always sworn by this weather app over any other and have always loved it. This new update, however is horrible. Did you really take away the UV index info on the app? I live in south Florida and look up the UV multiple times a day to know when to go do things outside and when to stay in. Guess I will be switching to another weather app that still has that feature."
4271,😠🤦‍♀️,"November 7, 2018",1,"Pop ups‼️‼️‼️ I don’t know why but I CONSTANTLY have pop ups on this new updated version! Ugh! It’s the ones that won’t delete. Like it’s a virus and has absolutely NOTHING to do with the weather. I finally had to ditch it. 🤬 Plus the fancy crap they add to this site (even commercials on the sides) the slower it makes the app run, the more I have to refresh, and the more useless it becomes. When will people realize MORE IS NOT BETTER! It’s annoying in this case. 🙄"
4272,DarkKnyht,"November 13, 2018",1,"Horrible update I LOVED the older version , it was so very easy to navigate and follow. I was able to list all of the cities that I travel to and were my family live...now I can only monitor a few😡😡🤬🤬 and the background is horrible. This updated version has a lot more settings but that doesn’t mean better...it’s quality not quantity!!!....I have  since stopped using this app as my go to and use the one that came with my phone."
4273,Hlrutten,"November 16, 2018",2,"Loads slowly since most recent update I’ve noticed it often won’t load any information since the last update.  The new redesign has been pretty painful.  It’s slowly getting better but I open the app, no information loads for over a minute.  I close it and have try again several times.  Have no issues with other apps on my iPhone."
4274,Holliwood =],"December 2, 2018",5,"Love the new update! I don’t usually leave feedback in apps but the weather app I use daily and had to express how much better the weather app update is! So much easier to navigate, less crash! Good job!"
4275,5838485868286,"December 13, 2018",5,"Apple should have this app pre-installed! This app should be on the iPad when you buy it. Since Apple gets their weather info from The Weather Channel, it makes sense to make it one of the default apps."
4276,tinylilmiget,"January 14, 2019",1,"Update and redesign are the worst! This redesigned app is the absolute  worst. I have used the Weather Channel app since it launched but this newest update is just infuriating. I find myself staring at my screen trying to find the information and I end up leaving the app with absolutely no idea what the weather will be like. Most days it’s more useful to wake up and look out the window for my weather.  Please give us back our old version,"
4277,TaxisLatka,"January 19, 2019",1,Update is awful In my opinion this used to be the go to app for Weather. The recent update is one of the worst app updates I’ve ever seen. They’ve completely ruined the functionality and made it so hard to find the information you are looking for that I am deleting this app and going to download and use a different weather app. Whatever team developed this update should be fired in mass. The original was so much better.
4278,Stoty67,"January 24, 2019",2,"Poor update ruined a great app Updates to this app over the last year have resulted in a difficult-to-read, user-unfriendly app. I enjoyed the previous version, and hoped there would be a return to a better format. I finally deleted the current version due to frustrations resulting from not being able to easily and quickly get information from it."
4279,Milesy55,"February 11, 2019",1,"Used 2 b Good, BUT NOW all it does is Crash !! I trusted & used this app for years.. But the last 2-3 months all it does is Crash...  I used to love the videos, they could b so informative & interesting !!!!  Unfortunately Now when I click on a video the page pops up & Then Vanishes in 1-2 seconds.  I have used All suggestions provided by Apple, Lifewire & others; but to no avail. "
4280,KitKat0821,"October 5, 2018",4,Thanks for the “daily” version update Original rating 1 star due to complete reformat an non-ease of use. Thank you for updating the daily layout to list high and low vertically instead of horizontally. It was terrible to view and today it’s MUCH better! Good job tech team. :) Review raised to 4 stars.
4281,DDtwo3,"October 6, 2018",1,WHAT HAPPENED!! This app was always my go to app for weather always spot on until the update. At first I thought I would give it time but it’s been quite awhile now and it’s not even close to the accurate forecast. As I’m writing this it’s pouring outside and this app reports that there is a 0% chance of rain. Also I get a weather alert and when I tap on it I get a blank white screen. Please fix!!
4282,ripmustang96,"October 8, 2018",1,"Worst update ever I have never reviewed and app before. However I felt that I needed to review this app after the update. The old app used to work great. I thought it was very good at predicting future weather. However, after the update, the app has been wrong on numerous occasions and ruined too many of my plans that were planned around the weather using this crappy app. I will no longer be using this app and have since downloaded a new weather app."
4283,Manicked,"October 9, 2018",2,"New update is hard to navigate Not digging the new update. The older version was simple and easy to see the weather for the week ahead. This new version is hard to read,(visually- not enough contrast or something. Hard on the eyes) difficult to navigate and they made it too complicated. Go back to the old version!! Simple is better, in this case!"
4284,Jennbee26,"October 14, 2018",1,Upgrade is a disappointment I shouldn’t have to flip through fields I don’t want to view just to find my weather information. The important current weather used to be the first thing you saw. Now you have to click an icon in the corner to view it. I come to this app for current and hourly and daily weather. I do not come to this app to view graphs and videos and information that has nothing to do with me in my area.
4285,Le0nidas09,"October 19, 2018",3,"No notifications New update looks snapchatish which I’m not a fan of but that’s cool. My problem is I haven’t gotten weather notifications in weeks. I used to know if lightning struck near me or when rain was expected in the next 30min. Now I get nothing. Made sure my location and notifications were correct, not a noob"
4286,Lmacforce5,"October 21, 2018",1,"Newest version is hard to navigate I’ve has this app installed for years, but this newest version is the absolute worst. Every time this app is updated it gets harder and harder to navigate and understand. I know they’re trying to pack features and info in it, but it gets to the point where it’s unusable, and I think we’ve reaches that point. Please revert back or make it easy to quickly read and understand again!"
4287,CamcM,"October 24, 2018",1,Updates I’ve been using this app for years and never had an issue but I decided to rate it now because the new update is just awful. It runs slower and I liked having the daily updates all together instead of scrolling to see each day. I understand you always want better technology but the weather is just weather. I think I’ll free up some space on my phone and just use the iPhone weather app.
4288,ConansLibrary,"October 25, 2018",5,New UI and Performance is Great Ole reliable Weather Channel came through with a much better user interface and the speed is drastically better. 
4289,Alemapgrebnesor,"October 28, 2018",1,Can’t see it! The new design is only good for people with perfect vision. I’m a 52 yr old who needs to wear readers for reading except for my phone because one can make the font large enough to see when backlit. You’ve changed your design so that everything is teeny tiny and use pastel colors or grey. It’s horrible! I’m hoping you will change it back to the way it was soon or else I will have to find another weather app to use. Bummer!
4290,JenJag21,"September 10, 2018",2,"New Update This used to be the app I would use regularly above all others. Not now. The new way the information is presented is confusing and busy. Also, I liked being able to see the 15 day forecast in a concise way and a detailed way, now it is spread out in a scrolling detailed view. I get a few days out and get lost even though it does have the date."
4291,Sjray58,"September 11, 2018",2,"October 2018 Update STINKS What a waste of time! This update is so ridiculous and a complete waste. The previous version was at least a bit more straight forward with information. This is all over the place. If I wanted Kindergarten Weather Reports I would tune into Big Bird and the Cookie Monster. It would be so nice to just get the numbers for the weather, sunrise and sunset, basically the facts, instead of “design”."
4292,Marmagmar,"September 17, 2018",1,Marmagmar This app was simple and worked for my purposes until the update.  Find another weather app this is not worth the bother and waiting for a fix. In addition the most recent update made it worse. What good is a radar map if storms can’t be tracked along with roads?  How can you avoid driving into flood waters from a hurricane such as Florence if you can’t see such details?  I used to able to do so - not now when it is so necessary!
4293,Mazargreen77,"September 18, 2018",1,"Update horrible This last update was bad enough for me to completely delete this app of my phone. The ads are so annoying and getting worse, the ability to view the temp throughout the day with a quick flip was great. Now everything has been changed, it’s multiple taps away. Some thing don’t need to be more efficient and this update was a huge step back. It’s been since early 2000’s but I’m back to weatherbug."
4294,Don't Buy CovertWireless!,"September 19, 2018",1,"Disappointing! The latest changes made are completely horrible. As a user, I find myself confused and frustrated every time I try to look at the weather while using this app. The older version was easier to navigate and had more useful information. Less videos and more weather information would be a great starting point for the next update. It’s time for me to look for a new weather app."
4295,852654ffF,"September 23, 2018",1,"New awful design The new September design is awful; it looks like an EKG heart test. Every time I look at the 10 day forecast I get dizzy from up and down  waves. Who ever came up with this design, you need to be working in a hospital not designing weather apps. Plus you can’t even change the the background color. Ugly,Ugly,Ugly. Until you bring back the old look or something new but better than this garbage I will be using weather bug from now on."
4296,AJG1969,"September 23, 2018",2,"Update is not an improvement I can’t find anything of this update!  In order to find the forecast, I have to click through several pages to get details. The other day, I tried to find info on the current weather, and never did find it. I think it’s time to delete the app. Too bad, since it used to be a good source of quick weather info."
4297,Siminadam2,"September 23, 2018",1,"Used to be a good app This always WAS my go to app for weather, it was straightforward and simple. They recently pushed an update and now it’s a hot garbage fire. The screen will constantly freeze now and sometimes won’t even open. Real simple guys, just stick to giving me what weather there is now and what will be in the near future. Stay away from trying to make this hip and changing, you’re not doing it right. Likely switching to a new app."
4298,kdb183246,"September 26, 2018",1,"Bad. This new update is horrible. It’s overly complicated and gives way more information than necessary on the main app page. When I click on the weather app, I should be able to see current temp, and high/low temp for that specific day....that information should be clear and bold and easily visible. I wish I could switch back to the old version where the daily forecast and current temp was front and center."
4299,Gael Wind,"September 26, 2018",3,"Liked the old app I am sorry that I updated to the reimagined app. I liked the white font on blue background better.  The old version was easier to navigate, though I appreciate less in-your-face weather drama videos in the new layout. Still, I will look for a different app that accesses the weather I want more clearly."
4300,Poo poo choo choo chip,"September 3, 2018",3,"Newly updated Was fine until this last update. It looks nicer but that’s about all. Runs slower, ads are easier to accidentally click and it shuts off any music/podcast/audio book playing when you open it. "
4301,razzaberry,"September 3, 2018",1,TERRIBLE SINCE THE UPDATE I hate this app so much since the update.
4302,NanaBee7,"September 5, 2018",3,Disappointed I am sure your update took suggestions from the masses and hopefully there are many that like it ... I am disappointed that the five-day at a glance was omitted ... unless there is a magic button that I haven’t found yet ... I only see two days at a time. The rest will just take some getting used to.
4303,LMB1022,"September 6, 2018",2,"Not sure about the new look The newest update has left the app less user friendly. I appreciate that they show you a graph of how temps change throughout the day or week... is it really helpful? Also, the way the hourly forecast is depicted horizontally after its been vertically for years seems less useful. Same for the new daily forecast. Bring back the ease of the old app."
4304,pillowtraveler,"September 6, 2018",2,I just want the weather forecast This new format is not conducive to just “getting the forecast”.
4305,Not a gamer mom,"September 7, 2018",2,"Hate the update I hate the new scroll method of screens/pages. I could not care less about anything after screen 2/7. What I do care about, hourly, daily, 15 day forecast was hard to find )hint, you can’t scroll down to see it) then the presentation held less information than in the past. Why do developers feel compelled to change what works? Just to collect a paycheck?"

4307,Emileebeth,"September 9, 2018",1,Terrible update The new update is just horrible. Get a different app!  The old app had all the info you wanted for the day and week right where you need it. The 15 day forecast was great. It’s gone.  It’s extremely hard fo navigate. It makes zero sense   I have always promoted the app. Now I’m telling go to find another. It has so much useless info. Most use it to see the the actual forecast. I despise this update and will have to get a different app now. 😡😡😡😡
4308,Old IM'er,"September 9, 2018",4,"Turn down the brightness I love the content, and now the ability to swipe to see hourly.  What I cannot stand is the inability to make the background dark.  "

Everytime i try to enable the notifications it prompts me to select location however it will not allow me to tap location to enable it.. I checked all my settings on my IOS IPhone 8 plus, and still cant get the notifications enabled.. This is very inconvenient because one of the purpose of the app is to get notified in advance about bad weather conditions.."
4310,Sandy Moan,"August 31, 2018",5,Have a question? The moon came up late. Orange and then 3/4 then turned white but why so late and big after a night of no moon? Maybe I didn’t stay up late enough last night? But can you answer why?
4311,Rumsonmom,"August 31, 2018",2,New format - UGH. I liked the old app layout.  I hate the new one and will be deleting this app as soon as I finish this review.  I’m interested in a quick glance at the forecast for the coming days.  That quick glance is no longer available.  You’ve cluttered your app with unnecessary information and just stuff.  I don’t understand what the intent was behind the redevelopment but the result is a big FAIL.  Big-bye.
4312,Melody and Harmony,"September 1, 2018",1,"Update is awful! The new look / esthetics of the update is truly awful! I live in the Midwest where the weather is always changing (including tornadoes) so I had been using this app daily, BUT I don't know if I can stand looking at the new updated graphics in order to keep using it. They went with a cartoon like layout and added a bunch more ads. I may have to stick to my local weather app. This new look is just hideous! So unprofessional looking!"
4313,JEM1972,"September 1, 2018",1,New App is awful!!! The Weather Channel app used to be easy to look at and easy to find all the weather info you needed...until this recent upgrade.  The white background makes it difficult to see the information. I can’t tell what half of the stuff is featured on the page when you initially open the app. This app is not informative at all after what I consider to be a downgrade. I’ll be looking for another weather app.
4314,JanettaD,"September 1, 2018",1,"Beautifully Redesigned? NOT. The Weather Channel app USED to be my fav weather app for years, until a few days ago. Now... deleted! It used to be easy to read at a glance. Nice colors, good contrast for quick info. This “redesign” features scrawly medium toned “ink” on bright white backgrounds. No way to reset backgrounds or font size/color. This went from being a user friendly app for on the go to looking like a page torn out of someone’s notebook. RIDICULOUS. Just switched to AccuWeather."
4315,trenamania,"September 1, 2018",1,"Hate this new version!!! Can I get the prior version back?? This is way too busy and troublesome to navigate, and I already paid for the year to avoid ads. I never would have paid for this version. I strongly prefer the prior hourly set up including the wind speed, as a cyclist who also commutes 16 miles each way to work, I heavily relied on this feature to know what to expect on my ride. I can’t even see the wind speed in this new version. Hate it 😡"
4316,astrorae,"September 1, 2018",1,"New update is horrible The app used to be useful. After the latest update and redesign nothing is to access or find. I feel like I am fighting with the app to let me see the info I want, info that used to readily visible on the main screen with a quick scroll down. As what I need to see isn’t easy to get to, I am switching to another weather app and won’t be touching this one again until it returns to something user friendly."
4317,Jonah Donut,"September 1, 2018",2,Strongly dislike new layout The new format is small and only if you are a visual person does the wave make sense. What was wrong with the original format I had for 5-6 years.   Now I am going back to WTForecast.   Bad redesign - esp when you have to give a training video pre release that should tell you something.    Have classic option and you might get me back.  Until it is WTForecast App for me now.
4318,ak3lly,"September 3, 2018",1,"Disappointed in Recent Update I’ve been a Weather Channel fan for years. Always told friends and family, it’s the best app for weather.  This recent update has really ruined the app for me. I really liked the simplicity of how the app used to be for daily temperatures. I’m sure there are people who really like the dew points and all the stats they’ve added along with videos and the sort. It’s just not for me anymore. I’ve moved the AccuWeather, reluctantly."
4319,Dlttlrr,"September 3, 2018",1,"Miss the previous Weather Channel app Not sure who decided the format of the new app is an improvement over the previous versions. For example, the 15 day forecast use to be easy to review and see temperature trends for that time frame.  Now you can only see one day at a time.  Also, as noted in other reviews, the ads take up all the screen space making the information difficult to use.  Not an improvement."
4320,Luv2eat2much,"August 28, 2018",4,My go to I am kinda a weather predictor.  I feel it coming in and I check often to see when a front is due in based on how I feel.  This app is great but I find the radar is a little slow loading and sometimes will blank out altogether.
4321,Nursemole,"August 28, 2018",5,"Love it!! I use the weather app daily! With my walks outside and when I travel 2 days a week!

4322,AFriendOfTheVoid,"August 29, 2018",5,"New App fixes all issues. The new app is simple, clean, and easy to use. I is extremely useful and easy to find the information you are looking for. Huge improvement, I hope it stays this way."
4323,Custardontheroad,"August 30, 2018",5,Love your app I travel a lot and use your app every day! Love it. My only ask is bringing back written articles rather than videos. I can’t always watch videos but enjoyed the Weather Chanel News articles. Thanks!
4324,Larlo73,"August 30, 2018",3,"Where’s the 15 day outlook on the new app? Although the overall appearance of the new app is somewhat great, I was upset to find that the 15 day outlook is no longer available. Even though I didn’t  expect it to be a 100% accurate report, it was nice to see, in a concise yet high level way, what was to come. "
4325,EJ3B,"August 30, 2018",1,"Worst Update The most recent update ruined this app.  If you’re looking at the “daily” weather - the pictures are literally so small, you need a magnifying glass to see. The background used to be blue so you could see the “clouds / lightning” etc - now its white. Impossible to read. Your only other option is to read a paragraph to figure out the weather. If it’s not broke- don’t fix it. Currently looking for a new weather app bc this is the WORST update."
4326,triciasart,"August 30, 2018",1,"New app format I’ve used your app for years and I can’t imagine why anyone would think the new graphics are better or helpful! The white backgrounds are visually boring, the lettering is way too small and it looks like something from the era of fax machines and the beginning of the internet! I don’t think the main page could be seen outside or at a glance!"
4327,gingercatx3,"August 30, 2018",1,"Crappy You took a perfectly good app and ruined it. I could see at a glance and with a couple of swipes what today’s weather was going to be, what the next few days’ weather was going to be etc. I don’t want to watch videos. I don’t care about all the extra crap that you have loaded into this app. I think it’s time to move to another weather app that is designed to show me the weather, not everything else in the world."
4328,w_e_e_n,"August 30, 2018",5,New redesign Aug 29 - yes! Thank you thank you thank you for making this app useful again and not serving up so much clickbait and random videos of llamas in Chile or whatever was getting in the way of the useful info. Well-designed and overdue changes.
4329,Cebsn,"August 30, 2018",4,Most recent update I new update is awful. The colors are hard to differentiate between am and pm and the wave to show the fluctuation of temperature makes it difficult to read. The other version was so much more straightforward and I could find the info I needed straight away.
4330,Annon84,"April 16, 2018",1,"Only Useful for Local Weather Forget trying to look up weather where you are vacationing or where you have family that you want to be able to look out for. Weather in motion is invisible most of the time. And if you ever find one of their videos appealing enough to try to “watch” forget it. You’ll get the AD loaded and it will play just fine, but that video will never load. Garbage app. So many bugs."
4331,Brt4X496,"May 2, 2018",1,Poor radar & feedback I am giving this app one star for the forecast. The radar only gives the option to view tropical cyclone tracking. I live in the Midwest and need to see many more severe watches and warnings. 
4332,David1876,"May 5, 2018",2,"New App is a real step backward I liked the old app much more. The new version is essentially the same as the phone app, and it’s much more cluttered with ads and other junk than the previous iPad version. It’s also more cranky; you must scroll down to get to radar and forecasts and the scrolling is not always smooth. I’m very disappointed that the old version is disappearing."
4333,DKZ2018,"May 25, 2018",4,"The app will not open... Have been using this app for years and really like the accuracy of it. Unfortunately, for the last 3 days, it will not open. Kind of a bummer because it’s Memorial Day weekend and would like to see if weather will be good for being outdoors."

4336,RockenJules,"June 14, 2018",4,Phone weather or pad weather I love using the app. It's so convenient to check on weather where we are traveling or where my family members are living. But I think the app on my iPad shows less then the app on my iPhone? I like the phone version better.
4337,Bet I don't get in again!,"July 18, 2018",1,"What’s up with this? I loved the old app and could count on its information in cases of bad weather, storms, etc. By the time you navigate to all the various locations, radar, etc you might possibly get blown away or worse. Storms pop up quickly and you don’t need to be searching up and down and around on the screen. Can’t help but wonder if this app is compatible with the hands free law for motorists? Would rate it negative stars if possible."

4345,slopyho124,"March 25, 2020",5,Best in the world I’ve watched the weather channel for over 15 years and they are so accurate with it and on the app I used to tell people wen it was going to start raining and they wonders how I did that.

4346,CarlosYanez,"March 24, 2020",5,"A daily guide It is mostly for the radar map and 14-day forecast, used beside the more casual iPhone built-in weather app. Useful are also the notifications that even go to the iWatch. Works fine on iPhone 11 Pro Max with iOS 13.4."

I go to the App Store and tap on the weather app...it says “open”...which I do...but it never seems to download onto my iPad. I’ve always hAd it on my old iPad..just like I have it on my iPhone.  Don’t know why I have to open it up in the App Store every time I want to use it!
4348,Helpless Reviewer,"February 14, 2020",1,"Caving in on themselves. After the desperate attempt to get money in trade for more incorrect forecasting didn’t work as planned, they riddled the app with so many ads that it will likely crash rather than showing the weather. You’re better off using the app that is preinstalled on your phone or just going outside."
4349,falconreid,"February 12, 2020",2,"Crashes constantly, very annoying I keep seeing ads for the premium version... I suspect the developers decided to make the free version totally crappy to get people to buy the paid version. Why would I pay money when even the free version constantly crashes? It used to be a very reliable app... apparently they’ve never heard the saying “ain’t broke don’t fix it”."

I don’t pay for the premium so unfortunately I have to deal with ads, before I updated the ads didn’t bother me much but with the update there is an ad after every daily forecast. It’s too many ads, I don’t want to see stuff when I’m just trying to read the daily forecast for the week. Not cool weather channel."
4352,indiana56,"January 26, 2020",1,"Hate the new format Have used this app since my first iOS device (12+years). Had multiple locations stored that I could change from one location to another just by swiping left or right. The new format does not allow for that, rendering it unusable. I will now be looking for a new weather app. Plastering postage stamp sized tiles on the same page does not improve the user experience. Not everybody has the eyes of a 20 year old."
4353,Sandy&Bob,"January 22, 2020",2,"New update Just had to delete the app and download the new update. Not impressed. The old app was much easier to read, let you save up to 10 locations, had much better & more detailed forecasts... shall I go on? And it did all this for free. Now everything is boxed up so everything is smaller & hard to read, hard to find. Can we go back tithe app before the update?"
4354,doughyjoey986,"January 18, 2020",1,Hire new people for the Midwest. This app is good if you want to want to know what the weather is right now this second but after that this app can become hard to navigate. Not because of the way it is set up but I feel like ever since they started pushing premium I am having problems loading any screen but the home screen. Sometimes the radar will have to run 5+ times before it starts to show any color
4355,CBKH24,"January 16, 2020",1,What happened? Used to love this app but lately it freezes up constantly and I have to keep deleting and reinstalling the app just to check the weather!  Also I agree with other reviewers that the pop ups have become too much. Do you not get enough $ from those same annoying ads that we have to watch over and over (and over) on your videos? Time to try something else I guess.
4356,clobnwjxlm,"January 12, 2020",1,"Lightening strikes ect... I was able to view this just 2 months ago but now I cannot. I think it’s ridiculous that you expect people to upgrade to premium and pay for it. I know having the ads is your way of paying for your app so keep showing the ads and give us access to everything under “premium “. Really? Nickname taken? No way! Can’t even leave a bad review . There is no way my nickname is taken, what a fraud"
4357,Bthwelding,"January 4, 2020",2,"Deleting due to ads I’ve used this app for a couple years now at least and it was my favorite weather app. When they first started to introduce ads to push people towards the subscription I was ok with it at first, but the ads have been getting progressively more and more to the point it’s annoying. So I deleted the app and have switched to another one."
4358,Not wirking at all..,"December 4, 2019",1,Bad ever since the change! Every time I open the app it either crashes and goes away or takes 2 minutes to load but when it does that it flashes like its going to close and then eventually opens.  Really inconvenient when you want to check the weather real quick.. seems like since the switch to this newer design the app hasn’t been the same and is very unreliable.  Disappointing.
4359,Suckered in too,"November 2, 2019",1,"Always begging for money ! The app use to be ok.  Now, it’s just mediocre at best.  Almost every time I want to check the weather, I get the pop up from the Weather app to sign up for their yearly membership for $10 a year or .99 a month etc.  Extremely annoying and not worth keeping the app or downloading it ever again.  I don’t recommend the app at all.  They are a dime a dozen, so this won’t be difficult. Maybe AccuWeather 🤔."
4360,SayWha24,"November 1, 2019",2,"Too many requests to upgrade This has been my favorite weather app, but recent changes have resulted in almost constant full-screen advertisements for the Premium app - sometimes multiple requests per session.  There should be a way to turn off the requests to upgrade - they are really interfering with the user experience, and usability of the app."

4366,Did you get it,"September 13, 2019",1,It wasn’t broken We had whether icons that work now there’s this piece of garbage. Since the weather app doesn’t work for these people maybe they could sell pencils on the Corner. ((My-cast)) always worked and gave you all the weather up today moment by moment. There is a storm right now lightning warning but I can’t pull up the radar. Instead of making a better app they took down the only one that worked

I stopped watching the weather channel because they never reported on the weather, now the app has pushed me over the edge."

I am not sure if your pipe is too slow or, more likely, I am wasting my time waiting on a multitude of ad servers. Either way, I find I use it less and less because of the wait time. By the way, both LTE and my home network are quite fast. Only this app makes me wait."

4375,Yellowbirdhead,"July 25, 2019",1,"Still horrible. Please stop the upgrade notifications. I already purchased premium version.  I still hate the UI that was redesigned in 2018, but use the app occasionally because I forgot to delete it and paid for another year of premium. What a waste of money that was!  Now, the app is sending me notifications to upgrade, when I’m already stuck with “premium” into 2020. At least I don’t have to look at ads, I guess."
4376,smokeysmoo,"July 13, 2019",4,"Pretty accurate The rain is usually started before I get the rain warning, but as long as you check the app it’s pretty accrue. Just remember that the weather changes constantly, so you still have to check throughout the day"

4378,ElianaUT,"July 4, 2019",2,Too much info; too buggy I have had this app since forever ago. When I thought the Apple app was too lame. But this app has only gotten worse over time. Too much information! Too busy! And—you never save my settings so I get constant alerts that I don’t want even when I Disable all of them. So I’m done. Deleting this app in favor of something far simpler and more personable.
4379,Nagoyax,"June 23, 2019",1,App not what it used to be They “upgraded” the app a while back and that upgrade has been a disaster as far as navigation ease within the app and setting up my locations that I need to check the weather. I keep trying to edit and save the locations without success . The app is slow at times and just not fun to use anymore. Go back to the drawing board on the current app.

It works well when it does open but that almost never happens. It really needs to get fixed. I’ve downloaded the Accuweather app and will use it instead and until this app gets fixed. So disappointing."
4382,Bill OC,"February 13, 2019",1,So slow it’s unusable Since the latest update it is so slow to the point of being unusable. I don’t know what it’s doing but it stops and hangs and takes forever to load the latest weather. Have had to kill it several times when it went completely unresponsive.

4383,Feldspar60,"February 19, 2019",5,Terrible I can not enable ANY alerts for my area. Is proving to be more worthless as days go by. Radar doesn’t seem to work anymore. Seriously considering finding something that works as it is supposed to.

4386,OhWhy07,"April 8, 2019",4,Great Ap! This ap is really awesome and I really love it! Checking radar or pollen helps me prepare for my day!

4388,Emc26102,"April 16, 2019",1,Abandoned! Awful! This app is worthless. Won’t load more than half the time. I’m part of a testing environment for Apple. I’ve reported it to them. They extracted log files and analyzed. Told me it’s not the iOS nor the phone. They commitment the app freezes. The only temporary fix is to delete it and reinstall. I’ve attempted to contact the third-party designer who writes it for TWC. No help. No response. I can’t believe the TWC would ever allow something like this to exist with their label. SMH.
4389,Chodeloffski,"April 21, 2019",3,Love the weather channel and it’s content but the app performs poorly I’m a weather nerd and love the weather channel but I must say this is literally the only app on my iPhone that gives me issues.  It loves to freeze and sometimes not load and I have to close the app out and reopen.  Disappointing for such a large company in my opinion.

Works fine if you allow ads of course. Have emailed support, they have ignored/never responded and latest update doesn’t address it.  Bottom line apparently is don’t bother paying the extra $3.99, it’s a waste of your money.  Come on Weather Channel, you’re better than that."
4393,App Rvwr,"December 3, 2018",1,"Disappointed in newest update I am so disappointed in The Weather Channel’s newest update.  We can no longer find things at a glance. The old format had a week at a glance of highs & lows for instance, we have to scroll through a lot more information to find this now & it’s hard to see a quick comparison. Very disappointed as this has been my go-to app for years. I did not like the trend of silly videos particularly either."
4394,dianathegreat13,"December 5, 2018",2,Very hard to read now Don’t know why they change light background and pale colored lettering and it’s very hard to read. And the other one was easier to use if I’m looking at hourly information it only does it for 24 hours you can’t scroll through a couple of days and see estimated hourly information Sounded like it was going to be good but very disappointed
4395,mitch.....r,"December 26, 2018",2,Good but need work Can’t determine the current location at all. The new style is confusing. The real time updates don’t work because the locations can’t be set. The videos are terribly click bait-ey and you are forced to watch the same 15 second add before all of them. Your better off watching the actual weather channel or downloading weather underground.
4396,buttsboys,"December 26, 2018",5,"Inwood West Virginia I just wish they would bring back the weather channel radar. I watched the radar all the time. It gave a better heads up for my area due to the way it was set up. Bring it back on xfinity/cable, Please!"

I did clicked it and it did crash each times I clicked to open... it was only last just few second to show what it is my weather to be in my home town and before I even tried to read it, it crashed!

4400,SandyBruns,"September 17, 2018",2,Latest update Honestly for update looks very similar to the AccuWeather app now. Personally I liked having the days as the first thing that I looked at not the hours. If you want to revamp your app perhaps you should allow the user to have settings where they can set it to display what they want to see when they open up your app not what you force them to see.
4401,CaitMarieH,"September 17, 2018",3,"Eh Haven’s been jazzed about this app ever since the app undated to using the wavy lines to represent the highs and lows on each day. It’s just an odd format to me. I also want to have weather alerts on, but HATE getting 80 million rain notifications that project rain down to the minute. I would prefer to only get emergency weather notifications."
4402,Poe_jeters,"September 19, 2018",2,"Hard to see forecast now After the recent update that completely overhauled the app, I find it difficult to see what the little weather icons are for the multi day forecast. There’s no contrast, and it’s practically white on white. I think that maybe just changing the background color and increasing the size of the weather icons (cloudy, rain, t-storm, etc...) would help tremendously."

Is there rain? Will it be foggy?? It’s so small to see and was better on a colored background. Trying to find all the things you had before and now they are all in different locations... not intuitive!"

4406,Dr Cozy,"October 16, 2018",2,"You should have kept it simple Sometimes keeping it simple is really better. I liked to quickly open the app, scroll to the left to see the 10 day forecast and click on a particular day to see more info. Too much to navigate through to get simple info and the “white design and thin lines” makes it harder to view without the darker contrasts."
4407,kladnier,"November 5, 2018",3,Love this weather app I absolutely love this weather app! I’ve used it for years but ever since this new update I’m unable to get alerts about thunderstorms or sever weather.

4408,CarRacer,"November 9, 2018",1,I loved the old version After many years of loyalty to the weather channel and then their app on iPhones. I have just now deleted it. I HATE the new version and the way it looks and moves. It is confusing and hard to navigate. With pop up screens that make it look like weird pages or switching over on the browser. So after many years it is gone and I will be downloading a new 5 star weather app.
4409,2ndsubie,"November 25, 2018",2,Bring back an older version Most of the time it crashes two or three times before it will stay open for me to use it. Not a fan of the new daily view. I want a 5-7 day view with highs and lows on one screen. I do not want to have to scroll snd scroll. Think of the screenshot you get at the end of your local tv station weather segment. I may be deleting very soon.

4414,HappyinAshley,"September 3, 2018",3,"Need dark colored background The new update has a light colored background making it extremely difficult to differentiate the weather at a glance. The light background makes it difficult to see the difference between clouds, clouds with a rain drop, and clouds with a snowflake. Please change back to a darker background. Thank You."
4415,ddkim1,"September 7, 2018",1,I thought Watson was supposed to be smart. All he does is make the app crash constantly. Old app was good. New update “NOW WITH WATSON” is a crashing piece of junk. It crashes when I open it and if it actually does turn on it will crash within a minute or two. Absolute garbage. Who tests these apps before release anyway?  Do you actually pay him for that job? Or maybe he just needs to be as accurate as a weather forecast. I’m downloading weatherbug.
4416,JudyZing,"September 8, 2018",5,The best weather app This app is the fourth weather app I have tried. The info is complete and interesting. The ads are small and do not block the page. I especially like the tropical storm and hurricane tracking.

4418,Western Justice,"September 14, 2018",1,Not Accurate The weather channel is not accurate. I use to scratch my head in confusion as to how the weather channel became less accurate than it was in the 90s. Then I discovered weather engineering technology from reading documents on the CDC website. Everything now makes sense. They cannot accurately predict the weather because it make link them to climate engineering. That or they can predict accurately but then climate engineering changes their predictions.
4419,Airline_gAl,"September 15, 2018",2,Don’t Like the New App I don’t like the new app. If I want to look at the long term forecast now and I’m trying to scroll it just pops up with the detailed forecast even though it’s still long term. I liked it better in the older version where you could just the next few days. I also don’t like the new layout. Even though it’s supposed to be streamlined it’s harder to follow now.

When you do find the week view, there is still a lot of scrolling down and too much verbiage. All we need is the sun symbol, the chance of rain percentage, and the high and low temperature. I’ve downloaded a different weather app."

I have had to switch to the other apps to get an accurate radar map. Sometimes it will even accurately state “raining” and yet nothing on the radar map. It’s like they simply took the radar out of San Diego. Ridiculous and frustrating.

4512,hombrhh,"September 10, 2018",1,"Never accurate This app is mostly worthless. The only thing it is good for is the CURRENT radar. Future radar is a joke as it blows up any small rain cloud into some huge mess that is never right. Future forecast changes 18 times a day and most of the time updates to 100% when its ACTUALLY raining. All videos have stupid ads that are nothing you will EVER need or want to know. Like I said though, only good for current radar. ONLY!!!"
4513,starr491,"September 15, 2018",2,I hate the update!!! Who’s ideas are these updates?  This one is terrible.  The colors are even terrible to visualize.  Not easy to read.
4514,anni_1,"September 15, 2018",5,Bring back the old app I want the old app back. I dislike this one and will look for something better. The layout of the previous version was so much better.
4515,TheIrishSmile,"September 21, 2018",1,Update The only reviews I’ve ever written (very few) are always raving about how an app is great. This is the first time I’m writing about a terrible one. This new update is AWFUL! I can’t find anything quickly! I shouldn’t get so frustrated with an app because of how confusing it is to navigate that I google another weather station to just find out basic info quickly. Please listen to all these reviews about bringing back the old version.
4516,jtjrblair,"September 23, 2018",2,"Update is a nightmare! I like be the Weather Channel on tv, and I was always a fan of the phone app, but this latest updated version is a nightmare. It won’t even open 90% of the time, and if it does open, it usually crashes. The new version is way too busy and complicated. I can’t easily find the info I’m looking for. Please take it back to the older version!"

This used to be my “go to” weather app, but the upgrade has really slowed it down...to the point where I often give up and go to a different app.  If it’s not resolved soon, I’ll delete it so I won’t be tempted to open it and get frustrated all over again  My husband asked me to add that he’s also unhappy with the upgrade.  That’s two thumbs down."
4519,JJ the Doggie,"September 28, 2018",5,Great App I have enjoyed the Weather Channel over the years and especially find the app to be very accurate and helpful.  The radar is great to check when wanting to see what is heading this way.
4520,"RLK, NYC","September 1, 2018",3,"What has Watson done!?!? The new version of the app is described as simplified...but you have to be an engineer to find the 5 day (or longer) forecast. Graphics are better but functionality has tanked. That the designers have chosen to lead with trend graphs is proof positive that they don’t understand what users want from the app: WEATHER FORECASTS, by location. THAT would be simple."

There are many other user-friendly apps that are readable and will simply tell me the weather. I agree with the others that characterize this update as a bloated pig. The best thing the Weather Channel can do is apologize to the customer, the talented development team that was forced to develop this app, and reverse the update back to the previous version."
4523,ssauls0613,"September 1, 2018",5,Love the new app I love the new app design. I could do without the video section all together though unless you want to use it just for forecasts and weather information. All of the silly crap could go. It’s just not relevant.
4524,DKBRLBmom,"September 2, 2018",2,"Take the update away! Not a fan of the new update. I didn’t realize I had automatic updates on my new phone and was irked to see the reimagined app. Auto updates are now off on my phone, and I wish I could go back to the old app. It was familiar, easy to use, and I could get to what I wanted to know quickly. The new design is more convoluted and difficult to find what I’m looking for."
4525,Vegtime,"September 2, 2018",1,The Latest Update (@25 August 2018) Makes It Worthless The “watson” update makes this app worthless. Light blue on a white background? Don’t you have designers on staff? The data is virtually illegible and finding any useful information is a search mission. The app has gone downhill since you got rid of the swipe feature to check the weather in other locales. I’ll be deleting if the next update doesn’t fix some of these usability issues.
4526,Pies Mom,"September 2, 2018",2,"Why?! Nooo! What did you do? Why did you have to make the most recent update so difficult to read? Please go back to the last layout. For someone who is visually impaired, the new layout is so difficult to see. Please don’t “fix” what isn’t broke. Sure there were a few things that needed some minor tweaks, but overall the app was 4-4.5 stars. Now I’m being generous with 2 stars."

Give me two numbers and I can figure it out. They also changed the location and format of all the forecasts (daily and hourly). I’ve now deleted the weather app. Hope the was your intention."

4531,Jim Corey,"July 30, 2018",1,Poor app service! The app is ok on weather reports. The app is however run by scam artists the want you to pay to have the ads removed and if you pay to have the ads removed you find that you have been scammed they take your money and you still have the ads running as well. I would not recommend this app if you don’t mind the ads and do not pay to have them removed you then get what you pay for.

4533,Meteor71,"August 27, 2018",4,"I Like the Layout of v10.0 The new layout introduced in v10.0 is very nice. It provides a clean orderly presentation of weather information. Sadly, however, there is too much extraneous material, such as video and news. I’d like to see the app modified to allow me to hide those sections that I don’t care to view."

4539,Fun messenger,"August 31, 2018",1,Bad update Been using your app for years but your new update and layout is horrible and confusing. Want to see my week laid out nice and simple and all at once and then click on a certain day to open it up and see more details. But your new version you have  to scroll and scroll and scroll and cant see the week laid out on one page. Why did you ruin a good thing. Will be looking for a new weather app.
4540,Tobb741,"January 24, 2018",5,Love this app I really like this app. It’s very informative with up to date info and it’s enjoyable because it has a lot of cute videos. It also has more serious and interesting videos and features.
4541,JJGENERAL1,"March 29, 2018",1,"It was good... So lately the app has decided that it wants to keep turning on alerts for me. Even though I keep turning them off, they keep getting turned back on somehow. Tired of the red “1” when I don’t have alerts turned on. Uninstalling because it annoys me to have to clear it for nonsense “rain” alert. I don’t care about “real time rain tracking”. "
4542,Mix111_qyz,"April 29, 2018",5,Pretty reliable Pretty reliable for your city and feature I like is that you can set your vacation / tour with cities on your way and have weather there as well. It was very useful during our trips to Europe.
4543,Cee63,"May 13, 2018",2,"Old one was better I really don’t care for this new version.  I have to hit the search button every time I want to change forecasts.  I liked loading several places and swiping through them better than constantly searching and tapping. I don’t like the format of  the daily forecasts, either.  Too much scrolling.  Sorry they changed apps."
4544,Sonicthecat202,"May 15, 2018",5,Great app This is a great app I use and I prefer this than others though as always the weather is not always right but this is helpful for when your in a area with high chances of servre weather (not sure if I spelt that right)
4545,amyhchi,"May 25, 2018",3,"Decent I only use this app for checking the day’s forecast. So I have no opinion on the miscellaneous features. However, I liked the previous app better because it included a “feels like” temperature in the forecast. I don’t care much what the actual temperature is; if it’s going to feel 10 degrees hotter or colder, That’s what I need to know."

4547,angola13,"May 29, 2018",5,Terrible! This “upgrade” from the old app is terrible. The radar takes forever to load. It didn’t on the old on. Not very friendly to visually impaired people like me. Switching to Accuweather from now on.
4548,Bob2112,"July 1, 2018",1,"NOT user friendly (unless you live ads) The new scrolling interface is NOT user friendly at all, making it very difficult to locate the information you want ( scroll, scroll, missed it, stop, scroll the other way, missed it again, stop, scroll). What happened to a single screen view with buttons to select hourly / daily / radar etc.  less taps and less scrolling please. Terrible update."
4549,Apple/Nintendo greed!!!!!!!!,"July 4, 2018",1,Download Other Weather App Once The Weather Channel started putting random videos online and on the app it was completely ruined forever.  The app is SOOOOO slow and buggy its unusable.  The only thing you cant do is actually check the forecast.  If you want to see 10second random non-weather related videos with a 30 second ad each time then this is the app for you.  TERRIBLE!!!!  Plain and simple.  WeatherBug app is 100x better.

4553,Buttalilly,"April 9, 2020",1,We don’t want premium It’s one thing to sell a $ version of an app within the free version. It’s another to practically crash your free app while doing so. You can barely navigate the app anymore! Had severe weather yesterday around 4am so I quickly tried to open the app to see the radar but was interrupted by a premium pop up. Come on! Today I can’t see any hourly data because of all the adds. The app isn’t usable like this.

I’ve submitted hundreds of bug reports and I’m even a paying customer. The app literally has so much potential, but changes to the app move at a snails pace. Really disappointing."
4556,Tomorrowland1969,"February 17, 2020",1,"I miss the old app The previous version of this app was amazing. It was simple and accurate. The new one is not as good as the previous one, too many features that are not of any interest for the average users. I would have paid for the old app, I will never spend a buck for the new one... I have already downloaded other weather apps to replace this one even if they are not so good as the old weather channel app. :("
4557,Jdaniel-ky,"February 10, 2020",1,Crashes and stupid ads So I loved this app and have been using it for years. But recently (as in the last few months) it crashes almost every time I use it. And also recently (last few days) it will display a full page ad which I can’t always get rid of. I’m a little upset that my once super useful weather app is now inefficient and annoying. Starting to look for another option...
4558,c136263,"January 27, 2020",2,Used to like it I used to use it everyday but then I found my phones default uses this same app information. Also it’s really annoying how pushy it is trying to get me to upgrade to premium. Idc what it does I just need the temperature and see if it’s gonna rain. So as a result I use it much less and probably will be deleting it soon and just using the phone’s default app.
4559,ed12334567,"January 18, 2020",1,App keeps getting worse Each upgrade further degrades the app’s value.  It’s all icons with little detail.

In my opinion very good marketing however for safety drop the sales pitch in times of emergency.
4561,Mimi336,"January 10, 2020",1,"Money grabbing, no response DO NOT SUBSCIBE I have always relied on this app, but it started having crash issues some time ago (I have the version for my IPad, for which I was charged $9.99).  I emailed and reported the problem to the Weather Channel and received no reply.  There doesn’t appear to be a way to unsubscribe and I am beyond frustrated with this issue.  DO NOT SUBSCRIBE!!!  Even a reply with an explanation or a way to cancel would have gone a long way toward appeasing me."
4562,Timidtammy47,"January 4, 2020",3,"What have you done?! The app was perfectly fine and easy to use until you started constantly changing it.

4563,Little Sqirt 95,"January 3, 2020",4,Used to be 5 Stars The implementation of paying for more detailed forecasts in the app has made me remove 1 Star just for being inconsiderate and making us pay for that forecast which gets plenty of money from the ads on their television channel....

This newest design is terrible. Couple that with the regular requests about going “premium” (how many times do I have to say no?) and I had to express how terrible the app design has become."

Terrible layout and completely unusable as every time you go into it and as soon as you get to the information you’re after (or before you even can), the app bugs out and closes itself.

But yesterday I looked up today’s forecast and it said 80 degrees. Turns out, it’s actually 91 degrees today. This is not an anomaly and happens all the time. So just add 5-10 degrees to their forecast in the Summer, -5 degrees in the Winter, +10% chance of rain to theirs and +5% to their humidity and you’ll be on track to plan your day.  Happy mathematics to everyone."

It is currently pouring down rain at my home so I checked the radar on the app to see how big the storm is. The radar on the app shows no rain yet it is raining at this very moment.

Mainly, I’m sick of human-caused global climate “change” (couldn’t make the “warming” stick) being touted on their videos as “gospel” when thousands of credible and qualified scientists have de-bunked it.

All I need are straightforward answers to a few questions: what is the temperature outside? How cold will it be when I leave the theater? How cold will it be tonight? Will it rain or snow overnight? I don't care for videos or radar maps or other bells and whistles. Also, I prefer to see the hourly forecast temperatures, precipitation, etc, on a table not on a bare line. You guys lost me."
4604,Annavon,"December 12, 2018",2,Hard to read I liked the app the way it was before you started your “reimagined app” revisions.  I find it hard to read and navigate.  I used to be able to swipe to switch cities.  It would be nice to see the high and low clearly displayed on the top of the screen.  I don’t like the weird graphic showing that temperature at different times being so prominent.

Now I have to read graphs and try to interpret things and wade through all kinds of crap to find what I need. "
4607,Vincent notabartolo,"January 14, 2019",4,After update the app keeps crashing This app works perfectly but after a recent update the app will launch for a second and it will crash immediately. It would also be nice to have the app fitted to the new iPad Pro 12.9 screen.
4608,Sheerdetermination,"January 19, 2019",1,Not as happy with the latest update. I liked the previous version of this app. It suddenly started crashing so I updated. I’m reluctant to comment on apps but i have to say I really don’t like the new look and feel. It also seems very buggy. It doesn’t scroll smooth. Tends to hang as if it is still loading despite good network speeds and plenty of memory on my phone.
4609,Erinkk,"January 22, 2019",1,Update made app confusing There’s too much going on and no concise way to just see what the weather is doing in a quick glance. I’m deleting this app. I’d rather use the weather app that came with the iPhone. Who has time or wants to spend more than a minute or 2 looking at what the weather is doing? This update on the app forces you to have to sit there for longer than that because it’s not user friendly anymore.
4610,HR is Here,"September 24, 2018",2,Used to be a good app This used to be one of my favorite apps until they just redesigned it. Now it’s hard to read.  Hard to get a quick glance without really having to study their new daily graph. I find it so unenjoyable now that I’m looking for a new weather app. The Weather Channel got me through many kid soccer and baseball games in the years past. It’s a shame they had to redesign.

The old school design was great... why “fix” things that aren’t broken?"
4617,mawhite23,"October 16, 2018",1,Terrible since Update I use this app all the time but after the update I’ll be looking for something else. The old version had my home stored and any other places that I saved as favorites and I could look at the weather for different places with one swipe. Now I have to type in my home city any time I want to view weather their while at work. It’s just inconvenient now and I don’t like it at all.

There's no option in settings to switch that and the layout is more complicated to read. For ex, to see the weather for the week, you have to follow a wavy line and scroll across. Before you could see the whole week simply and clearly on one screen. Just not great.."
4622,Blaxtone,"September 5, 2018",1,"New Update is Terrible This was my favorite weather app until the latest update. Much too detail with info you don’t need. People go on here to quickly glance either at today’s forecast or the extended forecast. This is not intuitive at all.  Seems cumbersome to navigate now.  Remember the saying, “Keep It Simple”. Would love a way to go back to the previous version. I might be deleting this if I don’t see any changes soon."
4623,Smrfette75,"September 7, 2018",2,"Too boring! The new colorless boring color scheme actually hurts my eyes. This is not fun like the old app that would rain when it was raining.

Now, when you look at the 10 day forecast, everything is white, you cant tell right away what the weather is going to be like. It used to be more colorful, now the sun is white, just like the clouds, so you have to take a closer look to learn the details. Every update, so far, was not good, imo."

4631,Jftnyc,"August 30, 2018",1,New look is terrible I can’t even use it. Color contrasts are extremely bad.  The screens are so difficult to read that I am unlikely to use this app going forward.  I am searching the App Store for other options.  Sad!  I have used the older versions for several years.  Yet another “app look” designed by twenty somethings with 20-20 vision and a need to show off their cool multi colored graphic design skills.  No thought for the general public.
4632,T Hawk 757,"August 30, 2018",2,"Recent update The recent update is terrible, the old app was so much more informative.  The weekly outlook is gone which was the best part of the app.  It was easy to see what the week may look like but wasn’t always accurate, which no weather forecast is.  I want the app to see the weather not watch videos and that seems to be the focus of the new update."
4633,Snf01,"August 31, 2018",5,"Preferred older versions I’m not a fan of the newest version of this app. I though the older versions were much easier to read, but now I have to sift through the app to find the day’s weather."

4635,Political gal,"September 1, 2018",1,Newest version very hard to read I really hate the new version of the app. The thought is thin and small and makes it very difficult to read on my phone. The new format is not intuitive and sincerely you’ll spend way more time on things that are irrelevant and what people care about which is just the plain old weather. Every version gets worse this last one was bad enough to make me write my first review ever.
4636,unityphreak,"September 1, 2018",1,"New update is really bad This new update is too different, and if I’m going to have to get used to something new, I may as well take this time to find a new weather app. You don’t even give me an option to set the color scheme back to how it was, and none of the information is in the same place. I bet a lot of people will delete the weather channel app from their phones and find something else. I know I will."
4637,lsitter,"September 1, 2018",5,"Update Not a fan of the update! Screen is hard to read, no 15 day forecast. I wish I could go back to the old screen and undo the update. Might try a different weather app."

There are too many graphs showing “trends.”  I’d like to see the current whether and the forecast without scrolling and poking through so many pages. If I wanted to see graphs of things that have happened over the last few days, I’d gather data myself and create my own graph. What I need is a weather forecast, decent radar, and less hassle."

This is another case of an alleged “upgrade” being forced down our throats and replaced by a far inferior product.

4649,rbatton,"August 29, 2018",1,Who designed this mess?? Wow! Who thought this was a good idea? Horrible redesign. Most useful features from the past are now either gone.. hidden or just pain don’t work. I’ve yet to be able to successfully turn on any sort of notifications. The UV reading seems to be completely gone. The 5 and 15 days quick look seems to have followed the same path as the UV... I used to love this app but looks like it’s time to look elsewhere

This was my favorite app for weather years ago but they have slowly junked it up with adds and other links and recently something has happened to the live radar that makes it go to western coast of Africa (not where I live) when I open it , wife’s phone doing the same thing. That is what caused my to delete it and go to weather bug."

4657,Disgusted Denverite,"May 12, 2018",1,Inferior and Infuriating This is NOT the app powered by The Weather Channel on cable! Takes forever to “boot up.” Configured so the ads cover weather Information. Lags when you try to scroll down. Difficult to find radar maps or news items. Obviously these people want to push the user into paying for an ad free and more complete version. Deleted this piece of crap and returned to the original Weather Channel app.
4658,newicestorm,"May 14, 2018",1,"Can’t leave well enough alone I give this app one star because the only thing I like about it is the accuracy. It provides a clumsy, endless scroll full of pauses and frankly more info than I need or want. I understand others may need it but it just adds to the overload for me. I miss being able to swipe to a new location and  that dreary brown opening screen has got to go. Don’t get me started. I’m looking for an alternative."
4659,ZannS,"April 22, 2020",1,"Where did the decent weather channel go? This is absolutely the worst weather channel made. It takes so much time to pull up, and when it’s up it takes forever for anything to work.  Radar is pitiful. It has to run through five or six times before it brings any radar up. And on the one that produces a picture it takes a few more times to have it move. Sorry I upgraded."

Too many ads recently This app was good for the year I used it until recently the developers have decided that they needed ads in every inch of the space as well as making the app ask you every time you click on something to upgrade to premium.  The only benefits are a 15 minute update.  Who needs that?  Decent app but ruined by greed.
4663,JRKobithen,"April 17, 2020",1,"Don’t get premium upgrade Being a commercial roofer weather is very important to us. I saw this upgrade and thought this would be very helpful, and for the first month it was. Then I logged on one day and all features were gone. I reached out multiple times and all they keep dying is they are processing my request and might get to me. I will not be getting this premium feature again. This is just a money grab."
4664,Stacymariex3,"April 12, 2020",1,"Ridiculous cost for premium and to many ads I don’t understand why anyone would pay $30 a year to get the weather when every where else it’s reported for free.

Deleting the app and trying something else."

One click and I had a full screen radar map.  Now I’ve got so much useless data on the screen that I rarely even open the app.  Useless data to me is any data that I don’t use and that applies to most of what I see on the new and improved app.

4670,Mr Colin Dude,"February 19, 2020",3,Ads?!? The full page pop up ads when you exit the daily or hourly details page are ridiculous.

I’m not a meteorologist...I just want to know, in simple terms, at a glance, what I need to prepare myself for the day.  Way too much information that doesn’t serve me.  Such a disappointment!

You need to tone it down. A LOT. People get sick and tired of being bombarded by ads. Buy this! Click this! Look at this! Enough is enough already. I’m deleting this app. It’s getting to the point this should be considered bloatware. It uses more phone resources to run the ads than the actual app. Nope sorry. Not worth it.

Pretty useless considering I already know its coming....offloading for now and looking for a weather app that actually shows me the weather forecast.
4683,Xx Syco Hawk xX,"December 27, 2019",1,"Locked a feature under a payment The future 48 hour snowfall is a feature that had been on the app for a long time for free. And now it is locked behind their “premium” subscription. Not sure how you think taking an old feature and charging for it makes it premium. If you want to charge, make features that give people a reason to subscribe. "
4684,Dandelionharriman,"December 14, 2019",3,"The advertisements are out of control Every single time I open this app, I’m hit with a pop up, it’s only been this way some the last update. But all of their ads are the worst clickbait. I like checking out the weather, daily, but I’m hunting  for another app that isn’t as difficult to get to."
4685,icedjoshua1,"October 22, 2019",1,⚠️This app is dangerous⚠️ If you don't join their monthly subscription service you don't have the ability to see weather alerts like a tornado warning on their radar and that is extremely dangerous cause you'd never know where a tornado is on radar they are playing with your safety to get money. They also doing it on Storm Radar app. What's next TWC pay for notifications? I'd recommend a different app
4686,HochiminCity,"October 20, 2019",3,"Frozen Ever since I went premium I’ve had issues.  And aside from missing the stories feature, every time I open the app it is frozen.  I have to hard close the app from running in the background and reopen the application in order for it to load past the blue screen."
4687,HIBeach,"October 16, 2019",1,"No ads... I’ve contacted you 3 times now and received 3 emails stating my concern will be reviewed. Three times I’ve heard nothing. I paid the $3.99 a few years back for no ads. In August I paid $9.99 for no ads and even attached the email receipt stating so! With the new update ads are in the middle of the screen, splitting the weather, which is annoying...especially since I’ve paid twice now for NO ADS!!! Please contact me to get this resolved!"
4688,Slosh113,"October 1, 2019",2,"So-so Been using for a while.  Temperatures seem accurate, forecasts not as good as TV news.  Most concerned about huge price increase for no ads, $3 -> $10.  The app is not 233% better.  Maybe it’s made in China and there’s now a tariff?  Or is it due to IBM milking every dollar?  I’ve switched weather apps.  I miss the old version which was much faster and I could swipe through different cities."

I need this for work and because I carry an epi pen for grass pollen.  I would also like alerts for hail, which is common in my area.  It may do hail.  But I am not getting alerts for pollen, and I am not getting daily forecasts.  The app is very limited and doesn’t work as expected.  I have reached out to them repeatedly with no response.  I want my money back."

Half the time I go to open it I am either stuck on the load screen or the app will suddenly close itself. A friend introduced me to accuweather and while I can’t navigate it as quickly, at least it opens every time I need it."
4694,25$@,"August 31, 2019",1,"Worst & Most Unreliable This app was good a couple of years ago, but gets steadily worse with every “update”. Temperatures are WAY off, radar doesn’t work most of the time or shows storms that have already passed your area. Didn’t show current location. Dumping this for a different more reliable app. What junk. Do not download this. Keep looking. Finally deleted this app for NWS app. Would give weather channel 0 stars if I could."

It takes a long time to open the app compared to before.  2. In the ”hourly” section, I can no longer order the appearance of the data - allergy report, UV index, etc."
4696,eicjsgyd,"August 28, 2019",1,"Overly complicated Your app is overly complicated. Also, missing one of the most in Porten factors in determining weather - Humidity. You have to scroll down three pages to find the current humidity and there is no indication of ongoing humidity. Keep it simple and include the important stuff. Also, I received a notification and when I open the app to read it it does not take me to the information it just dumped me on the main page."

4699,Jairusluke,"June 22, 2019",1,"Randomly changing notifications I absolutely love the weather channel app, BUT I only want to know the weather when I go into the app. I turn off notifications for “change ahead” and “real time rain” every day and it always turns itself back on in the next day or so. It is very aggravating to have to change it every day and I am about to delete the app and find something new if it continues."

I always liked this app better than the one that comes with iPhone. But, finally giving up on it, looks like they are trying to do too much and can’t maintain the app. Sometimes it doesn’t even start up. If fixed I will update the review to 5 stars. Right now it’s horrible."

Most times it will stay on the blue welcome/opening screen and act like it’s going to open then just close out. When it works it’s great. Just frustrating when it doesn’t."
4710,D S Smith,"March 3, 2019",1,"USED to be good It takes forever to load now. It kicks me out 2-3 times before loading.  I don’t like the newer display on a bright white background. The previous blue background was easier to read. Especially at night (some of us our vision has degraded over the years). Now it bleaches out vision. I have switched to Weather Bug (one time payment). Loads up quick, fairly similar item placement organization."
4711,Aristotle4lyfeeee,"March 8, 2019",5,Tiny little ding My absolute favorite thing about this app is that is makes a sound about ten minutes before any weather change happens. It’s really convenient and helps me prepare. I love it!

Go back to the old look or at the minimum make sure it’s giving alerts again.

4768,Critt MLT,"September 5, 2018",1,"Hate new update I’ve never reviewed an app before, however, I’ve had the Weather Channel app for a very long time and after the latest update I felt the need to update. . Although I’ve had more than one weather app, TWC app has been my favorite. After this last update, it is no longer my favorite. I find it very frustrating. Please change the interface back to the way it was. This was NOT an improvement."
4769,SkeetCaptain,"September 9, 2018",1,"So “Fixed” It’s So Broken Just WHAT are you guys thinking??? TWC used to be a perfectly good app, with comprehensive info at a glance... and with each subsequent “upgrade” I’m reminded that I never went to graduate school. As of Aug 2018, we’re now up to a post-doctoral deficiency in understanding the TWC app. Using the app is now akin to sifting thru a Tolstoy-length meteorological white paper. Maybe if y’all actually went outside and experienced actual weather you’d understand our frustration."
4770,Bill1052,"August 30, 2018",1,The older version was better This is the new version of their app. I liked the older version better. This version is complicated and requires scrolling up and down to find weather for the next few days. They decided to add several new features but they just clutter up the screen. It can’t find my location except in a general sense. The older version is stopping at the end of May. Please go back.
4771,karriegirl,"August 30, 2018",2,Not liking v10 Really don’t care about trends. It just makes the current info harder to see.  And I liked the easy access to storms I view radar etc that seems to now be gone.  
4772,willow411,"August 30, 2018",2,"Not everything needs to be changed! A few years ago this app was terrific, but with every so called update it gets worse. If you want accurate radar forget this app, it never agrees with any other radar that you can find. The 15 days forecast is a joke, most times they are wrong 2 days in advance. I guess it’s better than nothing."
4773,Ms.LP,"August 30, 2018",2,"New version is awful Weather Channel...you were my favorite. I faithfully checked you each morning and each night. You were simple to use. Then this morning, I woke us to an app I didn’t recognize. The colors all blended together. I couldn’t get a simple 5 day forecast on one screen.  I’m cool with change, just not the bad kind. Please go back to being yourself."

4777,RR518,"September 1, 2018",3,"Lots of data, but difficult to see.

4778,Aggrivated customer,"September 1, 2018",1,App gets worse with every update The app keeps getting worse with each update. The latest update and major changes are trash. This app is no longer user friendly and you can’t get just simple info anymore. Bring back being able to swipe between favorite locations. The white back ground is horrible and no one care about the videos and ads. I used to love this app and now I hate it.
4779,Kavias,"September 2, 2018",1,"Terrible The big change in presentation that occurred recently is terrible.  Before it was fairly basic but easy to find what you wanted...now it is just a mess and difficult to use.  Never extremely accurate but at least it used to be worth as a reference...now I’d look elsewhere.  Oh, the alerts are annoying because they are extremely inconsistent and many times are for areas nowhere near you."

The weather outlook is fine, but doesn’t tell you where the various weather stations are, so in a place like Chicago you can have temperature differences from on the lakeshore to 20 miles off the shore of 10F."
4782,dos gardenias,"June 7, 2018",2,"Uninstalled after update I am so upset :( I have been using this app for years and a recent forced update has made it unusable. Its extremely complicated and crowded and i cannot simply see the weeks forecast as I once could. It hurt to uninstall it, as nothing else seems to be as good as this used to be. Would rate the original 5 stars, but this is honestly about a 2."
4783,emmy_moo,"July 30, 2018",1,"Not accurate The radar is never accurate. Not even close to being somewhat accurate. If it even loads because 75% of the time radar never even loads.

4788,recoveryday101,"August 29, 2018",5,Awesome!! I’ve been using this for a while now and I absolutely love the new layout and detail of everything and how easy it is to find all the things you might want to. This is an easy 5 star app!!
4789,WHY?!?!!!,"August 30, 2018",1,"Ugh...update. I HATE the update. It’s so difficult to read. I’m huge with looking at the daily weather in a row but now all of the days and numbers blend in with each other. It’s so hard to know what’s what. It’s difficult to find everything. I used to love how everything was one after another and easy to find. Now nothing is where it should be. Also, where is the uv index??? I actually used that. Please go back to the OLD VERSION."

4792,jophan_c,"March 20, 2018",3,"I’m not happy I liked the buttons on the old app that let you jump to the page you want. This one, like the iPhone app, makes you scroll past all the stuff you don’t want. You’re supposed to make new versions friendlier!"

I reinstalled the previous simple, visually pleasing, and quite functional app from the same developer.  I think it’s all about annoying you with all the ads so you’ll upgrade.  It probably won’t be long before they won’t support the original I reinstalled.  Then I will drop this developer entirely."

4796,Corjebs,"May 8, 2018",1,"The ads I find the ads really distracting and some of them are depressing! It's like, I just want to check the weather! Lots of them are things like ""Most tragic moments"" or ""watch closely as debris hits someone"" like why do I want to see that? Of course it's people's curiosity, they take the bait and click and sit through an ad that makes the Weather Channel money. I know it's kind of like the shows you'd see on the weather channel, but still."
4797,HK Gigs,"May 9, 2018",1,"Prefer the old version I like that there is more info on the daily forecast, but the old version allowed me to see the weekly forecast all at once vs. having to scroll through each day.

4798,TarHeel Gator,"May 22, 2018",1,"New Weather Channel app doesn’t work I have used the old Weather Channel app for years and it is my “go to” app.  Tomorrow is the last day I’ll be able to use it.  I downloaded the new one, but it won’t load.  I live in the mountains.  All it will do is get to a “finding GPS location” page and spin.  I took it outside within wifi range and let it hunt.  Kept it there for 2 hours.  Nothing.  So, I’ll have to find another “go to” app."
4799,I don't have a nickname either,"May 28, 2018",2,"Wish they kept the old one This month the weather channel stopped supporting the app that I used every day. It was a great app that was easy to use. They have forced me to use this app and it’s not as user friendly.       Furthermore the old app gave the humidity, but this app doesn’t as far as I can see. Looks like I’ll be searching for another weather app because this one stinks."

I would never pay for premium because the hourly forecasts are really bad. Even a few hours ahead of time they miss badly. Watson is not fine tuned for rural areas. Maybe in cities it is better but if you live outside of metro areas I suggest using another app.

Other options out there that I will go back to if the ads don’t stop.

This was my favorite weather app. They have recently moved all the cool features to premium (long range hourly forecasts and 15 minute mini forecasts.)

4814,this nickname is taken toooooo,"February 12, 2020",1,"Never update I have had this app since my first iphone. Every time I update it adds more ads and commercials, not “bug fixes” as they so often indicate! It’s gotten to the point now where it’s almost impossible to navigate the daily weather setting.

4816,meloncholyrose,"February 6, 2020",1,"Hate the new app Please bring back the old app. It was easy to navigate.  It gave me an hour by hour view of the day on one page so I could quickly look at the whole day. It also included snow, rain, and wind velocity, hour by hour, which is important to me.  This new app is horrible by comparison. Or at least offer a choice.  One app for those who want it simple and one for those who want everything imaginable."

I’m deleting this from my iPad because it’s more trouble than it worth. Thank you Weather Channel for trashing a good thing. I’m sure people who buy ads on this site will feel likewise."

I guess only way for useful functionality is paying for it, which I will never do."
4827,stafannie,"December 24, 2019",1,"Finally deleted Used and loved this app for years. Unfortunately, once the option to upgrade to premium became a available, you could no longer just open the app to check the weather. You are constantly asked to upgrade to premium. Super annoying.

I just want the weather and other apps will allow the same thing with zero ads. Until this is fixed, I can’t put up with the gouging anymore"
4829,Bajanjack,"December 10, 2019",1,"Too many solicitations I understand them wanting me to pay for premium. However the invitations are nonstop and interrupt being able to view the weather. For example, on the “radar” screen, the top of the screen gets blocked with an invite to go premium to get lightning alerts. That might be ok if by  pressing the “x” it went away. That doesn’t happen- you have to shutdown the app and reopen. They have to know that-"

I have an iPhone X and every time I use the app and try to get back into it freezes and I have close the app completely and start over...ridiculous and it’s not the first time either did it with the last version. Quit making cheap apps!

A lot of the time I click on it and it a just a blue screen with no information displayed. With the old version I could be on the phone and press the app to check the weather. With this current version I can not do that . Please fix or bring back the old version. I’m ready to uninstall this app.
4857,72stingray,"May 20, 2019",3,Won’t stop sending annoying news updates It’s alright but I never really use it and it won’t let me turn off “breaking news” notifications which is super annoying. I had to delete it to stop it from sending annoying notifications.
4858,benarndt,"May 20, 2019",3,App is ok Too many adds and national weather emergencies taking over when I want to see my local weather. It is nearly impossible to see detail local weather forecast without other adds and weather announcements about other places getting in the way.

4862,RachelMyBelle,"February 17, 2019",1,Awful I’ve used this app since the beginning. Every update makes it worse. It’s so deconstructed now. Way too hard to get the info I need not to mention how glitchy it has become. Half the time it doesn’t refresh and other times it just crashes. Awful. I’m deleting and getting something else.

Please fix it, please go back to the weather channel I have relied on for decades."

4866,Wheat Williams,"March 12, 2019",2,"So bloated it’s downright annoying I am giving up on this app after years and years of daily use.

Some days I can go to it and have zero issue but most days I go to it it either freezes as I’m scrolling days/hrs or continuously goes back to the loading screen. I have started downloading other apps to see if I can find one that will work reliably.

4870,A MIDWEST FARMER,"November 7, 2018",1,"Inaccurate information This app consistently will provide weather updates, radars, forecast that aren’t really occurring. Today we were estimated to receive 3-5 inches of snow. Not a flake across the entire northwest region. I understand that weather can change but the inaccuracy provided on this app is beyond disappointing. Perhaps if this was a handful of times I would be more empathetic but this is a daily occurrence. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
4871,Sandman48414,"November 17, 2018",1,New and Improved is not always better Until the recent update this was one of my favorite apps.

Is this really the best you can do? SERIOUSLY!"
4873,stoket,"November 27, 2018",5,Redesign is great Just had to say the only reason I even use this app is because of the redesign. It was terrible before. Thanks for the redesign...everyone needs to adopt to the changes or find another app. No app appeals to everyone.
4874,84BROCK48,"December 18, 2018",2,Am I missing something??? So I get notifications saying rain or snow will come at a certain time.  I open the app and that certain time isn’t mentioned anywhere.  Just seems inconsistent to me that you would send me a notification stating rain will start at a certain time and there isn’t really anything in the app backing it up other than the hourly forecasts.
4875,Luminous52,"January 3, 2019",4,"Happy but disappointed I now have a new iPad Mini. I am happy this app now shows sunset/sunrise which I could not find on my prior device.

Of course, notice of this exploitation is buried in the 10,000 word Terms of Use. I'd DLed the app years ago when the my job depended on the weather. I deleted it as soon as I heard this news.

4879,Bowj14,"January 25, 2019",5,Best weather app I’ve used yet... As a snow contractor I rely on this app heavily and find its snow forecast extremely accurate. This is the only app I’ve found with accurate snow fall prediction and hourly weather temps through out the day.
4880,Alexandra NY,"September 19, 2018",1,"Disappointed w/ updated App The update is such a downgrade. The app was user friendly, readable and with this update it’s absolutely awful. I’m a bit beyond myself. I always enjoyed utilizing the weather channel app but now I can’t bare it. Why the need to change the entire interface? Just awful. Very disappointed. Go back to the previous version. Until then I’ll have to look to a competing weather app."
4881,FracturedKoi,"October 5, 2018",1,"Why does every update make the app worse? This app started as an incredibly simple and easy to use one. The radar was close to the top, didn’t need to hunt for it, and everything was more or less fit on one page of the screen. Now it’s slow and even more difficult to use than the previous ad-filled one (and it was a pain to use too)."

I guess I’m going to have to become a weatherbug recruit.
4887,Monmic,"October 15, 2018",1,"Used to be good I’ve had weather channel app for all my weather news needs for as long as I can remember, but with this new update I’ll be deleting. Can’t find current weather easily anymore, and even if you do it’s often wrong. Currently there’s high winds and heavy rain, the app says light wind, chance of rain LOL Good running conditions it say HA! Stop worrying so much about ad placement and worry a little more about accurate weather forecasts."
4888,Bob76 in Boston,"October 22, 2018",1,"Hourly forecast limited to 24 hours I used to love this app. But then someone brilliantly decided to limit hourly forecasts to 24 hours. That really limits the usefulness of the app. Tonight I’m trying to plan my clothing for a World Series baseball game more than 24 hours in the future and I do not know when the rain will end, do not know the temperature during the game. Please reinstate hourly forecasts to more than 24 hours. They were very accurate."

Now it is information overload and unnecessary. The app also allowed you to set up multiple locations that could be accessed by swiping between them. Now it is a swipe and select over and over. Don’t waste your time or money downloading.
4938,Northern Lumberjack,"May 30, 2018",1,"Certainly No Improvement If I could give you zero stars I would. Been using your app for several years on iPad. Always worked well. Just got notification that this version is obsolete - no longer supported. So I deleted and downloaded ""the latest.""  New version only displays in portrait mode, not in landscape. I went no further. Deleted the ""new"" app and downloaded a competitor. What were you thinking!?!?"
4939,mccaiba,"June 2, 2018",1,Terrible new design The app is much harder to read. The screen is now very cluttered and your eyes have to go searching all over just to find the daily high and low. The previous version was easier to find the information you’re looking for. Tell your team that more isn’t always better. The overall usability of this app has failed completely with the new version. Very disappointed
4940,Sriley93366,"January 22, 2018",4,"Review I have found the app most accurate of accessible forecast information.  I do agree, however with another viewer that the previous platform seemed better because it was more simple and user friendly."
4941,Jwl1776,"January 22, 2018",2,"Meh! Clunky and not very configurable.  Having to use search to switch locations is annoying, and the ads are intrusive.  This evening a banner said “Winter Storm Likely”. When I swiped it said “This is the time of year for winter storms below which were a string of generic winter weather videos, each with a lead in ad. Gee! I wonder why they did that?  I have no respect for click bait and those who use it."
4942,John E Ringo,"February 27, 2018",2,More and more problems Used to be reliable. Not so much anymore. Problems connecting to the internet. Problems loading weather information for the correct days! (Today it is still showing weather information from yesterday as current!)
4943,BAP1963,"April 28, 2020",2,"Terrible, since I updated the last two times! For years, this has been the only weather app I use, until now. The last two updates are TERRIBLE! Too much garbage, and not enough actual weather! And stop asking me to pay for ""Premium""! "
4944,Jaccaro,"April 10, 2020",1,"ZERO STARS Why “fix” something which wasn’t broken? More advertising dollars? This update is horrible, not user friendly, and the feature to look up the weather for where you were traveling to is gone. I used this app for many years, and will now be deleting it. It isn’t user friendly. Whoever was in charge of this “project”should find another vocation. You all ruined an excellent app."
4945,Krwest99,"March 22, 2020",3,"Weather Channel I like the app on my iPhone, but quite disappointed in that the app for Apple TV is not good. It has very little information for local Weather and the iPhone cannot be projected onto the Apple TV . Since I’m paying for the Premium version I feel that you could improve on this. Thanks"
4946,vandy46516,"March 9, 2020",5,"The Weather Channel is the Best I have several wrather aps on my phone.  The Weather Channel is by far the most accurate.  I rarely use the others, should probably delete them!"
4947,Deborah C.,"March 2, 2020",2,Revamp Of App Is Inferior Not happy with the new site display; not as intuitive.
4948,Cool ants,"February 26, 2020",5,"Excellent app I love this app so much. It has amazing features that allow me to have a full weather experience and full weather lookouts. Love the videos, forecasts and more that this app has to hold. Best weather app out there!!"
4949,TeaRudy,"February 25, 2020",5,"Just daily! Just wanted to mention, if you are having trouble with the new update, delete the app then download it again and it will work fine."
