0,CamilleFromTexas,"April 30, 2019",4,"Easy to use, wish focus was on health This app is very easy to use to log the food you eat - what I mainly use it for, to stay balanced. It‚Äôs far more efficient than in 2010, when I first started using it. I spend maybe 5 minutes a day total logging my food intake. I like that it includes nutrition breakdowns so I can pinpoint when I‚Äôm lacking iron, or calcium, or etc in my overall diet. "
1,SSJ Klahr,"August 4, 2019",5,"App Review A great service providing a platform for success on a human health quest. The My Fitness Pal application allows anyone to compile a detailed log of nutritional and fitness info into an easy to use, easy to interpret, easy to afford (free), and simple to navigate system. The breakdown of information into multiple charts and graphs is a phenomenal resource. The flexibility of being able to modify multiple facets of your goals such as macro nutrients, weight loss/gain per week, etc. is extremely intuitive and suitable for a wide range of fitness/nutritional goals. Nearly anyone can master this application within a reasonable timeframe of consistent effort and in turn become the master of their fitness/health destiny. My Fitness Pal has provided a great service and allowed for anyone with the desire to do so to achieve the best version of themselves possible. Also, after a long endeavor spanning months or years and reviewing your data in retrospect allows for a particular cognizance for what worked well and what did not. This, in turn, provides a chance to hone an adequate regimen into the ultimate program fine tuned to your personal goals. My Fitness pal provides an amenity that fosters a healthier and happier human race to those who utilize it.

3,Miles Of Fun,"April 30, 2018",5,"Great App for someone with a disability I have Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, and I am a recent heart transplant patient. I lost about 30 pounds before my transplant because I knew it would be a hard transition and it is important to give yourself and those helping you the best edge you possibly can. It‚Äôs also important to really educate yourself on nutrition and your body, I studied nutrition on my own did all the exercises I could, learned my body type and how I metabolize food. I also consult with my doctors and get blood work done so I know how to best tweak my diet to maximize my diet and health. Get some it‚Äôs always wise to consult with your doctors and even get a basic basic metabolic panel done to check your blood work. "
4,Casey Alin,"October 26, 2017",4,"Dietary Restriction Alerts & Polar Compatibility In my own, personal opinion, the features that would earn fifth star would be to expand compatibility toward Polar brand products and applications, and to allow users to enter in specific ingredient, calorie, macro/micronutrient restrictions to be alerted to in meals & recipes.  It would be great to know if something I ate (or am logging because I'm about to eat) will conflict with a low FODMAP diet, or has more of a specific nutrient than I want at the time.  I recall a previous version that would offer food tips (""this food is high in sodium"", ""this food is a great source of vitamin c"", etc.)"
5,Smileforliz,"July 25, 2018",2,Why don‚Äôt any fitness apps have a ‚Äújust had a baby‚Äù note? I used to love this app and many of its features but I find it lacking after having my baby. 
6,klynnshira,"March 13, 2018",5,"It made me realize My New Years resolution was to get to a certain weight that would call for me to lose about 15 pounds. I already ate rather healthy during my meals, but I had a problem with snacking. I wasn‚Äôt at the point of sitting down and eating an entire family bag of chips in one setting. I would however eat a handful here and there, eat 4 Girl Scout cookies twice a day, and some of the candy my grandma loves to send me every and I mean every holiday. I couldn‚Äôt see how much that snacking affected me. My fitness pal has helped me keep track of my calories as I take them in and it has worked wonders! I have been successfully losing weight and it‚Äôs all because I can actually see a number to know how many calories I have left in my day when I go to grab the snack. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I still snack some, but I‚Äôll do one snack a day now or half of the amount of chips and half of the cookies instead of a large amount. Another thing that this app has helped me with is realizing how I feel after I eat. For example if I am not eating healthier foods I usually feel exhausted the next day. I didn‚Äôt realize it before but now that I have a food diary to look back on I can see what I ate compared to how I feel."
7,jonnydesigner,"May 29, 2018",2,"Lots of functionality, but not a very good app This app is a good utility, but if they gave the UI and functionality a bit more polish here and there it could be great. Some things are just clumsy and/or glitchy which makes using it throughout the day kind of a pain. I‚Äôll continue to use it, but as other similar apps arise I‚Äôll definitely keep checking them out as there‚Äôs nothing really tying me to this one. "
8,Bored in Midland,"June 5, 2019",5,"Life changing if taken seriously I started using this app right at the apex of my weight gain during college. I didn‚Äôt participate in high school athletics and had virtually zero knowledge of anything nutritionally beyond, ‚Äú There‚Äôs a place that shoots out 5 dollar burgers.‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs most important to look at the composition of macronutrients in a few days worth of your particular diet, not necessarily using this as a ‚Äúcalorie counter‚Äù. It‚Äôs very hard to ignore some of the numbers that will pop out at you if you are diligent and truthful with yourself. It helps to motivate you in a different direction. Even though everything has nutritional information labeled as a requirement, it‚Äôs easy ignore until you start to realize that if Item A has 32g of fat and %4000 percent of my daily sodium intake... and that‚Äôs my daily between breakfast and lunch...  It could totally swing a large portion of my diet by just omitting that one item. "
9,wanderingbark,"November 13, 2018",2,"Almost useless for diabetics This health/fitness/diet app claims to be comprehensive, but has a huge gap in its user experience for diabetics. There is no way to input blood sugar readings in real time or to integrate readings from glucose monitors on here. Given how tied to diet and macro nutrients diabetes is, you would think this would've been a basic aspect of the app already - or an add-on that could pop up along with adding food or exercise. "

11,THE KINGüòÉ,"September 20, 2017",5,"Such a helpful app!! I've been using MyFitnessPal since February at the recommendation of my trainer. I am 45 and have never really had to worry about my weigh or diet until recently. I had put on 10 pounds and was shocked to discover it wasn't easy to loose (it had always been easy before).  With this app, it shows you it's all about math :-). I've lost almost all the weight I want to loose, and the reason I haven't lost it all is because I eat too much lots of days (or I should say, I eat too many high cal junk foods instead of protein and veggies that will fill me up without all the calories).  I am eating much healthier though and have learned to fill up on the healthy lower calorie foods most of the time. I feel great!!  I'm 5'6' and 125 pounds at the moment. Still a work in progress, but I love this app and am so glad my trainer turned me on to it!"
12,MC Soy Latte,"December 18, 2017",5,"Must have Fitness App MyFitnessPal is an incredible tool for getting a handle on your health and fitness. The app makes it easy to log the food you eat.  The calories as well as the grams of each macronutrient.  There are too many features to list, but a couple deliver tremendous value.  MyFitnessPal automatically updates from my Strava feed, so all my running, biking and strength workouts automatically show up.   The food database is very extensive, but you have to know something about the nutritional content of food because some of the food items submitted by users are pretty sketchy.  There is, a huge catalog of verified food items, so with a little bit of comparison, you get some accurate data. "
13,Bianca J 0,"June 14, 2018",5,"Life changing I first started using this app when I began bodybuilding. I would have never gained over 15 pounds in muscle and completely changed my body if it wasn‚Äôt for myfitnesspal. A few years later, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. I had to alter my diet entirely. I had no energy to even work out for 3 months while I waited for my body to respond to the changes I made so I stopped using the app, as I only associated it with tracking my macros for bodybuilding. I also had no knowledge of how little calories the majority of my extremely clean diet consisted of, and because of that, I ended up losing 16 pounds. All those years of consistent hard work, gone...just like that. After hearing this alarming number, I immediately started using myfitnesspal again to gain my weight back. I have not only gained the weight back, I have learned so much about the new foods I am eating. I am also happy to say my health is finally turning around and I am working out again!! While my doctor was the one who saved my life, I this think myfitnesspal had an incredibly strong positive impact as well. And for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
14,SSadie68,"July 21, 2018",5,It‚Äôs my home This app has saved me in life- It‚Äôs always there for me- I might stop for awhile- but when I‚Äôm ready to jump on the horse of conscious eating again- it‚Äôs there for me- and it remembers me and where I‚Äôve been. I‚Äôve been using it on and off again since 2012- and it shows all my progress.  It has every food item you can imagine/ and if not a close counterpart - the barcode option is amazing- you can count your workouts and water easily- when I tried keto- I could easily check how many carbs I was ingesting-and could balance out the percentages with what I ate next-
15,Twilightfire,"May 4, 2019",4,"Good but glitchy Def a good app I‚Äôve been using for years! Does the trick and has a lot of food information (calorie-wise). I like being able to copy foods from another day cuz I tend to eat the same foods often. The downside is that the app freezes so often when logging foods! I have to close the app repeatedly just to log the food. I wonder if this is their way of making you go for the paid version? I think it may be the moving ads that cause the freezing. It is really annoying and if there was a better app, I‚Äôd probably switch. It also gives me a high calorie ‚Äúbank‚Äù when I have a high number of steps, it seems too high. So high that I don‚Äôt log my workouts because then I‚Äôd have over 1k extra calories that I could eat but this is misleading. We arent supposed to see those extra calories and assume we have a free ticket to eat another 5 slices of pizza! That‚Äôs going to negate any workout you‚Äôve done. I know this but I don‚Äôt know about others who may be misled. I tried to read their definition of negative calorie balance but its written for someone who probably majored in kinesiology or something at Harvard. Geez can you write it in layman‚Äôs terms?! Otherwise, good app."
16,Briaxoxo,"July 24, 2019",3,"Inaccurate Percentages I‚Äôve used this app and other similar apps on and off throughout the years, and I‚Äôve noticed little things that annoy me about them that always eventually makes me stop using them for a while. This time, it seems to be the calorie and macro percentages."
17,omare123,"July 30, 2019",5,"Works wonders when used correctly! I‚Äôve been a MyFitnessPal user for 6 years now. I want to start by saying when I first started using it, I was using this app religiously. I managed to lose 15 pounds in 3 months. However, I was losing weight for all the wrong reasons and found myself tracking my diet and making sure I was only eating 1500 calories a day when I should have been getting 2000. As soon as I stopped using it, I kept the same weight until I went to college. Freshman 15 is a real thing and that is exactly what happened. I gained all my weight back but it wasn‚Äôt just fat, I was gaining muscle too because I found myself weightlifting regularly. 2 years later, I found myself big with a slightly higher than normal fat percentage. That is when I started using my fitness pal again. Now I use this app correctly, and have been losing a moderate and healthy amount of fat a month, by keeping track of my macronutrients and making sure everything that I eat align with my goals. This app does exactly that. Now I have gotten into a routine of logging my food. It used to be a chore, but now it‚Äôs a habit and it‚Äôs a habit I‚Äôm happy to have!"
18,Auserv,"December 12, 2019",2,"Bugs seem to be getting worse rather than better I‚Äôve used this app on and off for over 4 years, including paying for the premium features for a couple years now too. I‚Äôm constantly put off by the frequent crashes and glitches requiring me to repeatedly close and restart the app just to log food. Creating a recipe, which should be a basic feature, is near impossible thanks to awful interface problems. For example, when you try to scan a food to add it as an ingredient in a recipe, if the barcode isn‚Äôt recognized, it acts as though you had closed out of the recipe creating process entirely and everything you had added to that point is lost. And even when you manage to get the entire recipe added, it seems like a coin flip as to whether it will actually let you save and log it rather than erase everything and make you start over again. I have been patient with this app (clearly, to be paying for it still after years of this stuff!) but not only have these bugs not improved in the time I‚Äôve been using it, they seem to have gotten worse. After just sitting here and spending 20 minutes trying to add a simple recipe with nothing to show for it, I am finally done with this app, just canceled my subscription and I‚Äôm going to see what else is out there."
19,craycray.,"January 22, 2020",3,"Technically a horrible app On principal, this app is great. The method of calorie counting is the only way I know how to lose weight and maintain it. My fitness pal makes that possible. But from a technical standpoint, it‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs basic stuff. It freezes up all the time, or it‚Äôs slow at the very least. It‚Äôs search is kinda bad. When I search recent foods, it doesn‚Äôt seem to always remember them or it‚Äôs as if I have to type it in verbatim, all words and the brand in order. At the very least it should remember something I ate a few weeks ago. Seems like it doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a lot of clutter in the database. For example I can do without other people‚Äôs recipes that say ‚Äú1 serving,‚Äù How do I know how big a serving is? It‚Äôs interface is weird and pretty much outdated, it‚Äôs hard to find features. "
20,Lounswoman,"September 25, 2017",5,"Lost 47 pounds already this year Fitness pal works so well for me. It doesn't judge. It just records facts. I committed to telling it everything except the occasional milk in coffee. I am creating new habits and I didn't quit the first time I was at an unexpected party and went over by 1700 calories that day. I acknowledged that this was the first exception to my new habits and not my habit. I still lost weight that week. Yes, the two pound loss for had targeted. This week was the first week I maintained my weight since April. Every other week has been a loss. I'm totally okay with that. I still log everything. I exercise six days a week. Swim or bike or walk. I counted my 4 hours of volunteer bar tending yesterday as a two hour leisurely walk. It's all good. MyFitnessPal is my pal in this endeavor and I give it the highest rating because it is always there, consistent, and ready to record my steps along the way, be they baby steps or giant leaps of progress. My blood pressure mess are down, I'm no longer prediabetic and my liver enzymes are way down. My fatty liver is also losing weight. If you work it, it will be work for you. üòç"
21,FLSunLvr,"February 28, 2018",4,"MyFitnessPal free app Just started using this app about a month ago. Used to use Diabetes app and loved it, but no longer supported. There are four problems with this app: 1)You need to type in the brand name of all recipe ingredients-the list of choices isn‚Äôt in alphabetical order by brand so it takes forever to find correct nutritional information; 2) For homemade recipes, the number of ingredients is limited, so you have to split up recipe information to account for all calories; 3) There is no way to edit a recipe, so make sure you have all of the ingredient information entered correctly (my fault, here.); 4) This app doesn‚Äôt include fiber calculations, so doesn‚Äôt show corrected carbohydrates-if it did I would give it five stars, even with problems 1-3, above... It does give suggestions of trends in what you often eat together as a quicker way to add your intake at a given meal. Also has a nice weight loss trend feature which helps you see how much you‚Äôll lose if you keep up calorie burning activities. Does contain ads at free level-no big deal for me... I understand that the Premium app ($$) doesn‚Äôt contain ads."
22,Sara-noH,"March 19, 2018",5,"Very convenient and effective! I started using this app as part of my lifestyle change to lose 100 lbs. I have used this in conjunction with other things such as my Garmin. It is very convenient to be able to sync this with my Garmin so I don‚Äôt have to add my activities or calories burned. I love that I‚Äôm able to scan the things I eat and easily add things that do not have a barcode to scan, a must for this single (and very busy) mom of 4! Being able to add my own meal recipes has been wonderful as well; recipes that‚Äôs have been passed down from family (Mexican dishes) which have always been hard to keep track of is no longer a problem. This app, I‚Äôm certain, has allowed me to enjoy the foods I want and be mindful of my consumptions and portion sizes. It really has helped put a perspective on my own habits and also had helped me identify how my body gains and looses weight, which I feel is different for everyone and is imperative when trying to lose weight. I lost 75 lbs just by adding this app and of coarse increasing my activity levels. A++ and a 5 star rating from me! Great job developers!"
23,IAmSam2012,"March 29, 2018",3,"Amazing Concept. Atrocious Navigation The idea behind this app is great. It is Do helpful for losing weight and building muscle, and monitoring your friends‚Äô progress. But, the navigation is absolutely horrible. The app is sluggish, and it‚Äôs confusing to get around to different features in the app. Certain things like scanning an item‚Äôs barcode take WAY too many taps to get to the right spot.  And I use the barcode feature a lot, but it‚Äôs annoyingly buried within several layers of pages. It and other features like the restaurant location tool are just buried way too deep. You should be able to get to them from the first page you open because I‚Äôm opening this app many times a day for only a few minutes to log something and it‚Äôs so annoying having to navigate through so many different pages to get to the features I use the most. Please redesign. It‚Äôs been exactly the same for years now. And get rid of some features. The developers are trying to do way too much with what should be a simple app. Or at least bury the less used features and make them harder to get to rather than the different food logging tools."
24,Akakat76,"August 14, 2018",2,"Not User Friendly I want to use this app because I can link it with the Walgreens app and get bonus rewards for my healthy activity. The problem is that I don‚Äôt like it very much because it‚Äôs not user friendly. I don‚Äôt like having to add each exercise I do along with the number of sets and reps and approximate number of calories burned (which I don‚Äôt even know and would have to look up). Also, adding recipes is a lot of extra work too because you have to add each ingredient and then match it up. I would like to have access to an extensive library of different kinds of exercises (calisthenics, yoga, dancing, etc) with the approximate number of calories burned for the amount of time I do them. Similarly, I would like to be able to look up and ingredient for a recipe select the amount used and then have the amount of calories for the ingredient factored in to my recipe and the amount per serving. I also don‚Äôt like the list look of the app; it‚Äôs not very interesting. I would like to have buttons for each meal, for adding exercises, weight, and water consumption. For now, I‚Äôm going to go back to using My Plate by Live Strong; I can‚Äôt add recipes but it‚Äôs easier and more interesting to use."
25,davmey,"January 29, 2019",1,"The UX is awful Adding meals is such a mystery, you can tell that they try to reuse screens as much  as possible, making the performance of adding a meal and adding a food confusing because they look exactly the same. But that‚Äôs not the worst part - the part that made me stop what I was doing to come directly to the App Store and leave a pissy review. The fact that I have to manually save my progress when creating a meal, like its 1995, is so stupid and counter intuitive to modern apps that it must have been a conscious decision. How ludicrous! I have lost 10 minutes of work logging meals 3 times since purchasing my membership two days ago. The identical screens make it so easy to push the back button one too many times and complete lose all of the foods I‚Äôve logged in a meal. It doesn‚Äôt try to prevent you from doing it either - so bad! Here‚Äôs what should happen, every change I make should automatically be saved. If I want to change something later I can do so easily. I can‚Äôt, however, recall 10 minutes worth of food logging with the same amount of ease."
26,lalay513,"April 12, 2019",2,"Not a fan of the auto-adjusting I diligently track my macros everyday (which is why I have subscribed to the premium version of this app), and I‚Äôve recently decided (with the guidance of my nutritionist) to change the amount of protein, carbs, and fat I have. When I make these changes, the app auto-adjusts the total of amount of calories that I ‚Äúshould‚Äù have daily. But listen here - no one asked for this! I certainly didn‚Äôt!!! I should be able to say how many calories, and how many grams of protein/fat/carbs I want without the app stopping me from doing both. As it stands now, I can only do one or the other, which makes no sense. I get that MFP most likely has medical professionals on their team helping to create the suggested macro/calorie breakdowns; but again - I‚Äôm not looking for this one-size-fits-all mess. I‚Äôm on a serious weight loss journey (down 138lbs, with 60lbs+ left to drop), and I‚Äôve got goals to meet. Please consider disabling this unnecessary function. If I‚Äôm paying $50 a year, this entire setup should be customizable. I‚Äôd rather not use a different app, because y‚Äôall have the best bank of foods to log for tracking, but I‚Äôm not planning to continue paying for something that doesn‚Äôt meet my needs."
27,üåöKitty,"May 5, 2019",1,"CALORIE COUNTING IS UNHEALTHY! calorie counting can damage how you see food and can lead to an eating disorder! i used to use this app all the time, and i can assure everyone reading this that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre eating ‚Äútoo much‚Äù - it matters WHAT you‚Äôre eating. 1000 calories worth of healthy food is NOT the same as 1000 calories as junk food but you would never know that using this app. You could be eating 1000 calories of junk food and still feel like you‚Äôre eating right because you‚Äôre eating the calories ‚Äúyou‚Äôre allowed to eat‚Äù This app makes you feel guilty for eating even if you‚Äôre eating healthy. there‚Äôs no reason you should be hungry and have to check your phone to see if you‚Äôre allowed to eat. There‚Äôs no reason you should go to bed hungry because this app tells you to. Do not download this app - you should not be obsessed with everything revolving around food and weight. it can lead to so many problems especially if you‚Äôre insecure or just more prone to it. i‚Äôve been obsessed with how i eat because of how much i used to revolve my life around this app and sometimes i still catch myself counting calories! if you really want to lose weight, stay active and eat healthy(but it is also always okay to indulge in yourself sometimes)"
28,Queenie11766,"October 15, 2019",4,"Very helpful I recently started using MyFitnessPal and it is very helpful especially with tracking food and exercise. There are a couple of things that could be improved and those being on the home page I wished it showed all of your stats-calories eaten and remaining, carbs, fat, protein, sugar, fiber etc. I would also like to be able to set my calorie intake for the day and not have it adjust due to exercise. Maybe there is a way to do that and I just haven‚Äôt found it yet. Finally being able to enter the type of diet you eat would be great and then if you are low or high on calories, protein etc it would make suggestions on specific foods to eat to make up for any high or low.  It does tell you if you have surpassed the ‚Äúlimit‚Äù but having suggestions would be amazing. I am also able to link it to my Garmin to record steps etc. One last thing I would like to see is an area to record vitamins/medications you are taking and figure those into the daily allowance and a place to record blood pressure, pulse, sleep patterns and other personal health info. Overall I am very pleased. It‚Äôs played a big part in losing my first 8 pounds!"
29,ImNotGoodAtThis,"August 6, 2019",5,"Really helps This app has been what I have been lacking in my fitness journey. I‚Äôm finally able to see little differences in my body because I‚Äôm keeping to my calorie deficit. I have the app connected to Apple Health, but isn‚Äôt capable of connecting with the FitBod app which is what I use. The only thing that I‚Äôve experienced is that frequently I will refresh the app to add in my workout and it will subtract the calories leaving me with even less for the day. Usually I will close and re-open the app but it hasn‚Äôt been working lately. I re-installed it in the hopes of it getting fixed. "
30,Semibald,"January 15, 2018",5,"Easy to use and lose! The only way I lose weight is when I‚Äôm counting all my calories. With this app on my phone, I can always do that. I set my goal of 2 lbs loss per week, and I love the graph that displays showing my progress each time I enter a new weight. The only thing I would ask the developer to improve is the recipe section, where you can add some recipe you eat all the time, such as a salad with 5 or 6 ingredients. This makes it much easier to add that same recipe to your food intake another time. But today I tried to enter my breakfast and it kept trying to leave the recipe page as I entered ingredients - Kodiak Buttermilk Cakes, skim milk, 1 egg. When I finally finished it, it had the correct calorie count, but it said I ate 14 g of protein, and that‚Äôs just for the Kodiak mix. The total protein should have been 21 g. But overall this app seems to enter accurate info (outside of the recipe function), and I find it extremely useful for calorie counting, weight loss, and keeping track of protein intake when I‚Äôm working out."

32,Tattooed_Mermaid,"February 21, 2018",3,"Please Help A Keto Girl Out, App Needs A Net Carb Calculation Feature!! This app is by far the best out there!!! I am a loyal user & a premium member, however I am going to have to jump ship soon & that is why I am giving the app 3 stars. I have lost over 150 lbs following a Keto Lifestyle. I am managing this through the use of 3 different apps at the moment because despite multiple users, including myself asking repeatedly the developers have yet to provide a feature in this app that allows for the calculation of net carbs! Instead users are forced to take to the web to find shortcuts & software patches to add this feature (which only work on a desktop through the website & not on the app & most of the time won‚Äôt work at all). So I am pleading, please add this feature!!! I am no software engineer, that is certain, but this can not be that difficult to do or a stretch to far based on all the other amazing features this app has. The other Keto apps out there don‚Äôt come close in comparison! But I will not continue to pay for a service that does not give me what I need to continue on my journey of good health."
33,vgrund,"May 15, 2018",4,"My Constant Companion Overall this is a great app.  I use it very frequently and I maintain a premium subscription. It carried me through a weight loss journey and through a transformative year in which I became a long distance runner.  As a runner, I really enjoy being able to track and alter my macros (and correlate to results).  I really love how it adjusts my total calories based on daily exercise.  This app has an expansive food database plus an ability to create custom foods and recipes, which I use extensively. It does have it quirks. I do not like how it often insists on opening to the Home page of blog entries.  It should open directly to either (1) the diary or (2) a dashboard summary of nutrition (calories to go, macros, etc).  Otherwise it is just slowing me down. I use this app in all its forms, phone, iPad and web browser, m and I occasionally experience sync issues with food items. The fix is to go into the problem items and tweak them to force a write.  Overall, highly recommended.  Like exercise, it is no panacea and one gets back only what one puts into it."
34,Spartanclass,"June 5, 2019",1,"Premium subscription is a scam I absolutely love this app and have used it for years without issue to track macronutrients and plan food intake. Recently my training routine changed where I would need to have different caloric intakes on different days of the week. So I decided to purchase a one-month subscription to the premium service to see if it added convenience. This is where I lost all respect for MyFitnessPal. Now that I have ‚Äúpremium‚Äù, the app refuses to sync to the website. It will say ‚Äúfailed to sync data saved locally‚Äù each and every time. When copying over meals from the previous day, it will copy the meal 8-12 times. When I then go to delete these extra entries, the website crashes and shows an error screen. What used to be a great app/website has overnight turned into a nightmare. I have since created an alternate free account that syncs without issue and copies over meals as before, except now I have to rebuild my food library from scratch. So therefore the only issue is the paid subscription. This is crap, MyFitnessPal! Does any of this sound like a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù experience to you? I‚Äôll just go back to manually changing my calorie goal every day as before. Thanks for the headache and the wasted $10."
35,Elise Knows Best,"November 27, 2019",2,"It was great... till it wasn‚Äôt Hi there, I decided to get MyFitnessPal to aid me in losing weight. And it worked, the app I mean, for the first 50 days. But yesterday, the fiftieth day, I went on there, and the app wouldn‚Äôt load. It said updating, so I was just thinking it was going to update, and be ready in a few minutes. Nope! I give it twenty minutes, look back at my phone, which I‚Äôve left on the screen, and it still says updating. Then I think, oh it might be a long update, so I give it even more time. Now, I‚Äôm about to go to bed, this is almost forty-five minutes later, and I check again. STILL UPDATING! I was hoping to give a good review, but I‚Äôm glad I waited till now. This app was at least good for fifty days, so if you‚Äôre looking for something short term then this is great for you. But this app really needs to work on it. I have no idea if it‚Äôs just a bug or if this is the apps way of telling me to get premium. All I now is that I have logged for fifty days in a row, and because this app quit on me, I can‚Äôt log fifty-one. Please fix, and I might change my rating to something a bit more, positive. Also the only reason it has those two stars is because of the first fifty days. Now it‚Äôs just done."
36,missesvargas,"July 23, 2019",5,"Great App for tracking Keto diet with membership! I recently started using the unpaid version of my Fitness Pal to log my daily calorie count and track and lose weight.  It is a great tool.  I really like the option of adding your own recipes, which is missing on Fitbit.  It is time consuming to add your own recipes, but if you are serious about losing weight, it‚Äôs worth it.  Once the recipe is in, it is saved and becomes a lot quicker to add the next time you eat it.  A given plus is that now you can sync MFP with Fitbit (don‚Äôt need membership for this)! You input your food items in MFP, and the information will go into Fitbit per meal and the steps on Fitbit will appear in MFP.  When I decided to implement the Keto diet, it became a little difficult to decide what food choices needed to be changed; this is where the paid membership comes in handy.  I became a member, and can instantly see what foods dramatically affected my carb, protein, and fat intake.  Great tool for anyone that is trying to lose weight, I highly recommend."
37,Trying to write a review!,"November 20, 2019",3,"Not supportive for someone trying to gain weight I‚Äôm using the app to try to gain weight after several months of losing weight due to body shaming. This app helps me make sure I am getting enough calories, but its layout is not helpful for me to mentally deal with hitting my calorie goal: when I reach or exceed my goal, rather than telling me I did something that is making me healthy, the app turns the number of calories ‚Äúremaining‚Äù from green to red, and the calorie bar graph also turns red‚Äîthis enforces in my mind the idea that eating less is better, while eating enough is bad, and so encourages me to slip back towards anorexia, and I have to work really hard to mentally fight against those thoughts. Furthermore, nearly all the posts in the feed are about losing weight and eating less, which is not helpful because I need to do the exact opposite in order to become healthier. Seeing those posts make me feel pressure to lose weight, which is not a good thing for me to be feeling. "
38,Abby142109,"July 22, 2019",3,"Used for years I‚Äôve used this app for about 7 years now. Having recovered from an eating disorder to being clinically classified as ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù this app has been through it all. Several things need to change. Otherwise it creates poor body image. When I look back in the weight I once was I get down on myself. But what I don‚Äôt take into consideration is the fact that I‚Äôve gotten older and my body has matured. Instead MyFitnessPal just shows my graph progressively going up. The app also doesn‚Äôt care what you eat. I could eat 1000 calories worth of apples or 1000 calories worth of potato chips and it would make me feel guilty either way. When someone eats nutritious, healthy foods, it shouldn‚Äôt count against them. Obviously the calories could be counted, but have a section of empty calories vs calories that fill you up. I also HATE that they don‚Äôt have ‚Äúquick add‚Äùanymore. Sometimes I do not feel like entering a whole recipe just to log my calories. It‚Äôs a great app for weight loss and management but I feel like some aspects don‚Äôt take into consideration body positivity or the importance of just eating healthy."
39,Shireen1953,"January 11, 2020",5,"Nutritional information I really like this app and I believe it to be the best one available to anyone who is trying to eat healthier, exercise more, and keep track of the different nutrients we are consuming in our diet. I only have one request. I know that there are a lot of your clients who are on keto/Low carb/Atkins programs. I see under most all of the nutritional information that you have broken down the carbs so that you can see fiber, sugars and sugar alcohols. For some reason when I click on the nutrients for the day, everything is shown there except for the sugar alcohols. The reason I ask for that is I could easily calculate the net carbs for the day if the total nutrients for the day also show not just the fiber but also the sugar alcohols. Then it would be very simple to calculate net carbs without looking at every individual item I ate for the day. The only other alternative would be if you just calculated the net carbs for us and added that line to the nutritional information. Just saying."
40,Charles1834rf,"September 24, 2017",5,"Good until data loss Liked the app.  It has a great nutrition database.  However, with the upgrade to iOS 11 I lost 18 months of weight data and progress photos.  Big loss after investing in the premium service and lots of time logging my progress.  The company offered no support and no credit offer.  Seems they should have a better solution for backing up user data and reimporting after mishaps.  Seems also they should have tested the app with the iOS 11 update process.  My one star is for the poor data storage and recovery and for the poor customer service.  Update: support got back to me with the recommendation to reinstall and the history including pictures were restored.  Better solution this time so app stars increased to three.  Still cumbersome solution and it took six support emails and two different support reps to get to this.  Would have done it myself except the app delete message said that all data would be deleted."
41,Angelkiss7,"October 5, 2017",5,"Can‚Äôt live without I‚Äôve been a yo-yo dieter for a good portion of my life.  One thing I can‚Äôt stand is going on a diet, because then I sabotage myself by having something that is not ‚Äúon plan.‚Äù  With MyFitnessPal, everything is ‚Äúon plan,‚Äù because I‚Äôm holding myself accountable.  I know I shouldn‚Äôt want or give into the need to have a cookie, but I‚Äôm human, and I do.  By tracking my food, I am more than satisfied with my one (or two üòá) cookies because I know what happens when I eat more and that it‚Äôs not going to help me lose weight.  Every time I get back on MyFitnessPal, I lose weight.  I lost 50 lbs. in a little over 6 months to get pregnant with my son.  Well, I fell into the pregnancy cravings, and then went through a lot of stress eating after having him to the point that I gained 75 pounds back.  I‚Äôm back on MyFitnessPal for about 6 months now and I‚Äôm down 40 pounds.  Yes, I still have a lot to go, but I know I‚Äôm going to get there because this works.  It‚Äôs not a diet, it‚Äôs a lifestyle change."
42,HeidinKent,"January 19, 2018",4,"So far I love it Trying to lose weight. I hate dieting, I hate tracking nutrition intake, because it is such a pain. But we‚Äôre in a new age, this is sooooo much better, simpler, easier than the old notebook with looking up nutrition & calories on the computer. I love tracking everything now. You get credit for exercise, looking up food is easy to do, I always have my phone with me...  This makes monitoring calories in - calories burned so effortless. It is easy to get caught up in exact #s for each nutrition but I use this as a good guesstimate on calories, carbs, protein, and fat to keep me on track. I can easily go back and edit prior day. I can see weekly totals. "
43,Colonelbrig,"February 2, 2018",5,"Even for the Casual Tracker I admit I am not a hardcore training kind of guy.  But, even at my level of mild (really mild) training, and paying mediocre attention to what I eat, the FitnessPal app is very useful. I do try to pay attention to making my entries, and because of that, I do watch my calories more so that I would do otherwise.  When I run out of my allotted calories, I pretty much stop eating for the day.  Beneficial from two standpoints:  1) I know what my calorie intake should be, and 2) I actually pay attention to it, from a consumption standpoint.  So, even though I am not enthusiastically training, I am also not just eating everything thinking it is okay.  Just the awareness and self-imposed accountability of tracking is far better than a lackluster approach of paying no attention at all.  I also count my steps, which is personally satisfying, and have my FitnessPal cross-linked to Map My Ride, which my wife and I enjoy using, also.  Thanks for both!!"
44,Dogodokov,"March 17, 2018",5,"Very useful, easy, pleasant interface First, love the new update so I can hit ""Nutrition"" at the top of the screen rather than scrolling to the bottom, since that's what I want to see most. I've been using this app for many years; it's the best to fit my need to casually track what I eat just to be more aware of how much protein, sugar, iron, etc. I'm getting in general. It's really easy to use, the food database has a huge variety of options, and the fact that you can add your own nutritional information from personal recipes is handy. I've never gone for the upgrade because it already fits what I need perfectly but I definitely see how someone might like the perks of Premium, like knowing patterns of what times of day you eat certain things and breaking down your food into categories of protein, sugar, etc. It would be useful if I cared about being more specific and intentional but for my need to just casually be aware of how my nutrition is, the free version is super."
45,Annoyed User@annoyed,"January 17, 2019",5,"Love the app, but its calories are off I love this app. I have used it for weight gain and weight loss. The barcode reading feature is awesome. With this, I am about to plan my entire day‚Äôs worth of meals in one sitting occasionally. Every once and a while, I can fit in one junk food meal during the day, which just means I have to eat less during other meals that day, but its that ability that makes losing weight easier."
46,Denlap3,"June 16, 2019",5,"Do it, Log it, Be it My son is very under weight and we had trouble keeping the weight on him. He is non-verbal, can only eat smooth food items or shakes, and doesn‚Äôt really communicate that he is hungry. We offered food and hoped he ate some of it. It was a random approach and not too successful. We needed an application that we could use at home that would make it easier to keep track of calories and nutrition on a daily basis. MyFitnessPal was recommended by a nutritionist a few months ago and we‚Äôve been using it ever since. The barcode scanner makes it fast to record nutritional information on packaged food. I just figured out the Mobil phone app - big time saver. We are still trying to figure out custom food items and how to record his weights. Instructions are found by separately Googling. It would be nice to have better instructions within the app. BTW he gained 4 lbs in 5 months so tracking was the key. It made us do a better job ensuring the food was consumed."

48,blouj422,"August 16, 2019",4,"Highly recommend for Keto beginners This has been so awesome to use! I had stopped seeing results in my diet and found this app when looking to figure out what I was doing wrong. I am diabetic and trying the Keto diet, and using the premium features, I have been very grateful to be able to see the breakdown of my fats, proteins, and carbs. My reason for 4 stars is based solely on the fact that it can sometimes be difficult to add foods when they are homemade. I make a lot of my own recipes at home and find that I end up having to list the main ingredients for each meal. I really wish I could add my own recipes that I have created. There might even be a way to do this, but it hasn‚Äôt been easy to figure out. Overall, if you are trying Keto, or just trying to get healthy and lose extra weight, this app is awesome. The feature for adding foods using the barcodes has to be one of my favorite. This has really helped me to visualize my daily, weekly, and long term goals with structure and confidence. Highly recommended app!"
49,TheUnknowCLash,"June 28, 2019",4,"Great but Missing a few things I‚Äôve used this app consistently for over two years and generally speaking, it‚Äôs very helpful for tracking calories i‚Äôm giving me a good picture of the nutrients I‚Äôve consumed each day. I realize I use the free version so the features I wish it had may be included in the version you pay for. I follow a Mediterranean based diet per the recommendation of my physician. The free version doesn‚Äôt differentiate between added sugars and natural sugars. I have to eat a banana every day for the potassium and work hard to include a variety of fruits in my diet. every day I get a message that I‚Äôm eating too much sugar because of the (natural) sugar in the fruit I eat. The app also tells me I am eating too much fat if I eat an avocado and some olive oil in the same day. These are healthy fats and are encouraged for the diet plan I follow. I just ignore these messages, but for someone just starting out or someone who is easily affected by those messages, it may be worth exploring the paid version or a different app."
50,Mav2316,"October 12, 2017",5,"Great way to log / track your food intake This is a very convenient app when it comes to logging you food for the day, the UPC reader is especially convenient for quickly and accurately logging any type of health prepackaged foods when you're on the go. I recently purchased the Microsoft band which I thought would interact with this app. Unfortunately it isn't quite there yet, it does log my steps from my phone but unfortunately I don't always have my phone on me so the band it likely much more accurate... Although you can add your physical exercise manually in the app so it's more of a convenience issue that anything... "
51,sassmaster93,"October 23, 2017",5,"PLEASE ADD A NET CARBS SETTING!!! This app is so awesome in terms of the food database which is the main reason that I use it. But I am on a strict and permanent low carb/keto diet. This app does NOT give me an accurate consumption of my daily carbs because it doesn‚Äôt include net carbs. YES, I realize that you can just subtract fiber from total carbs but this is NOT what is used to determine your daily macros. Some days my macros will show that I had between 11-15% carbohydrate consumption for the day when almost 2/3 of that amount is fiber (aka carbs that DO NOT affect blood sugar). It‚Äôs really disappointing and discouraging to not have a setting that allows me to implement my personal goals. Please add a net carbs setting and this app will be perfect! I am contemplating whether or not to continue subscribing to the premium. I will definitely cancel my subscription if a net carb setting is not implemented within the next few months because I simply cannot keep track of my goals without that."
52,Hefcbeijcnien,"November 16, 2017",3,"Customer service? Is there a way to directly ask questions about the app? I didn‚Äôt see an option to contact the developers anywhere. I‚Äôm mostly just confused whether Im using the application wrong or if this is a glitch of some sort. I have my goal set to ‚Äúgain‚Äù weight. For some reason it always displays for me that I have gained 9 pounds in one day. Not possible. And also I have lost weight not gained weight and even though I update my weight in there it is still displaying numbers that don‚Äôt pertain to me or make any sense. It also notifies me when I lose and displays it with a green arrow as if it was my goal to lose weight... even though I clearly see my progress and what weight I have typed in, it still displays everything incorrectly. I only use this app to do a calorie count and make sure I‚Äôm eating over my recommended amount. The rest of the features are just frustrating to use. Any person can figure out that starting at 89, then going to 93, then to 90 would not mean that you have gained 9 pounds."
53,Deeyo12,"May 22, 2018",3,"Too many clicks Waaay too many clicks to get to the scanner. Unless I haven‚Äôt been able to find something that is there after over a year, there‚Äôs no way to just scan an item to store for future input without logging it into the diary. Sometimes, like when you‚Äôre shopping bulk at the market, you just need the information for later. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs possible. Also, of course MFP has a huge database of foods, but using whole and  fresh foods to put together recipes is extremely cumbersome. For example, a homemade granola bar recipe could have a lot of hidden, unnecessary calories, but it‚Äôs a lot of trouble to enter everything in the correct measurements to equal one serving. I feel like I should enter an exercise count after each recipe, it‚Äôs such a process. Taking 10 minutes to enter ingredients from a home cooked meal does not incentivize me to use this app anymore. And importing recipes does no good, because since every person is different, every recipe has to be modified in some way, usually over several ingredients. Looking elsewhere."
54,Reluctant Reviewer üòè,"June 7, 2018",1,"Premium Subscription I understand two things with the nature of free trials and subscriptions. If you forget about them they over charge and do it without notification. This is the first app review I‚Äôve ever done, not only because I was charged for a YEAR subscription after one month of trial (They could have just charged me 9.99 for another month instead of taking the last bit of money I‚Äôd had available for kids shoes). Listen, I understand that I should have set a reminder and cancelled my subscription like an adult, but sometimes things get busy and we forget. Thus, me trying to contact a human via phone or email (not picky here...just a human). I tried thrice to email and was refused the privilege of sending it because the app rerouted me to learning how to cancel my account. Trust me...I already did that. I just wanted to see if I could contact a human to explain the frustration, and yet I‚Äôm now reduced to having to send a negative review in a public forum - and kind of hate myself for it, but if you can‚Äôt even let me email you...? üòè"

It‚Äôs a bit cumbersome on the exercise and Food/intake counters because it takes so long to find a matching workout / food. But for a free app - it definitely solves the tracking problem with multiple factors (unlike other free apps ) A bit Annoying that it refuses to reduce calories below 1200 even if you‚Äôre a very small , older woman and doesn‚Äôt give you the option decide whether or not you want exercise calories to be added to your daily count when you workout. So in the first weeks I was maintaining and started gaining until I realized what was going on. It also didn‚Äôt properly integrate with the weight gurus scale and I think it messed up the records because everything was working great before I ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù but now the history gets wiped out when I make changes in this app. Ugh!

This app is AMAZING!  It makes calorie counting not only convenient, but also kind of fun.  Additionally, it helps me take my nutrition beyond just calorie counting and breaks my meals up across the macros based on goals I have set.  If you are using some other app/ system to do this, I would be hard pressed to believe it works as well or even close to as well as this one does.

I wanted an app to start tracking my calories and downloaded this because I like under armor. The problem was each time it wanted me to sign up it asked for my age, and when I put my actually age, it denied it. So I tired a birthday above the age of 18 and it let me in. Normally I would be ok with that because I have to input a fake age for a lot of things. But it says that we need to put our age for an accurate measurement of calories. So if I lie about my age then how is it going to give me an accurate data? Also what‚Äôs the harm in a kid under 18 losing weight? I want this app so I can lose weight without ruining my growth by eating a lot less than I need to. So why is there an age restriction?

There are very few things that aren‚Äôt in their library of logged foods, and I also enjoy the fact that you can add unlimited recipes in it for easier logging for home cooked foods! The interface seems to be a little outdated and could be improved, but in terms of actual usage, this app trumps any other food logging app. The one thing that I would change is the progress section. I don‚Äôt like how all my progress pics I take through the app get truncated; I started taking my own pics using the camera app, which I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to do. You also cannot add measurements in the app (like chest, hips, waist circumferences). You can do it in the website, but it‚Äôs so much easier if I could do it all at once on the app. Overall though, I‚Äôm very pleased with this app. And a GIANT plus is that I don‚Äôt feel like I need the premium in order to get everything that I need!"

I have gained quite a bit thanks to the stress, lack of sleep and regular exercise. This app is similar to other calorie tracking apps in terms of having crowdsourced calorie counts but what really does it for me is the tracking of macronutrients and the motivational messages that pop up when you log. The macronutrients really demonstrate where your weaknesses lie, obviously in carbs, but also when you eat your most calories. In addition, the little motivational messages of ‚Äúthis food has high fiber‚Äù and ‚Äúif every day were like today you would be x pounds in five weeks‚Äù is very motivating. Lifestyle changes is about finding something that sticks, and this app helps me hone in on problem areas that I need to work on especially if I don‚Äôt have time to exercise and limiting my intake is the only way to stay healthy."

70,Thornjosie,"September 10, 2017",4,"Good app I love that this app really does help hold you accountable for what you do each day in regards to water, food, exercise. I do wish it was a little less time-consuming to add foods, especially when you have something like a casserole or a soup with multiple ingredients but yet you have to go through and add each little ingredient that would be in that casserole one at a time. It's not worth it to make a meal out of it because you may never have that again."
71,Fixer bus viva,"December 14, 2017",4,Love this App! This app has been so helpful with keeping me motivated to loose weight. I love how much food is already in the database and how easy it is to scan things. It is very user friendly. I give it 4 stars because I wish it would track more vitamins and minerals. It is interesting to see what nutrients I don‚Äôt normally get enough of. The information helps me to make food choices that will fill what I am lacking in my diet. I would love to see more minerals and vitamins added to the nutrition panel. It would also be awesome if my fitness Pal would recommend foods that I should eat next to help gain those nutrients not yet filled for the day. I would give this app 5 stars for that upgrade and I would be willing to pay for it. As of now I use this app the most but I also use the Wholesome app to learn both my micro and macro nutrients. It is time consuming to log food in both apps. I would love for my fitness pal to do both.
72,Ozzirus,"January 10, 2018",4,Favorite app to lose weight with but could use improvements. I‚Äôve had this app for years and have tracked my calories on and off every time I want to lose weight. It‚Äôs gotten a lot easier to track because all my frequent foods are already saved. The only suggestions I have are:
73,tedandrhonda,"April 23, 2018",5,"Excellent! I have used Fitness Pal for one week and I‚Äôve lost 3 lbs! It was easy to replace sugar saturated foods with healthier foods.  Now I have plenty of energy,  and I never feel hungry.  Fitness Pal is very easy to use.  All you have to do is weigh yourself set a goal to lose one or two pounds a week and Fitness Pal will tell you how many calories you get for that day.  You enter what you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner and you can see every day if you are on track to achieve you goal.  You can also see what‚Äôs in the food your consuming.  My wife is diabetic and she checks her blood sugar several times a day, after a week she lost 7 lbs and her blood sugar dropped from 188 to 124.  If you can select healthier foods and you can do what we are doing which is to get up and walk every day, Fitness will do the same thing for you and I promise you won‚Äôt be starving."
74,Facebook and insta user,"June 30, 2018",3,"Works Fairly Well This app does indeed work decent. The issues I‚Äôve had with it is the measurements of certain foods are in strange quantities like grams and such it just makes it complicated to figure how much you ate of something without taking a scale everywhere you go. My main #1 issue with this app is its suckiness to communicate with my Fitbit app. I wear my Fitbit all day most every day and I set up this app to use my Fitbit to calculate my step count for the day. I would say 6 out of 10 times it does not transfer over my information. Which then causes me to show that I went over my calorie count for the day when I know I walked 7,000 steps that day. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating when an app says it can do something like link up with another app and then isn‚Äôt capable of following thru with it. Over all it works well the only thing I wish they would fix is the connectivity of this app and the Fitbit app. If it worked better in that area I would give it a four or more star rating"
75,schreky,"July 13, 2018",1,"Problems hanging up and crashing The last few updates have made the app unreliable. It seems to take forever updating food and exercise entries. At times it becomes totally unresponsive. I have to quit and relaunch frequently. Last night it took me twenty minutes to make three food entries for food items I eat frequently. My iPad mini2 is current in all its iOS updates. I seldom have more than two apps running at a time. I have reinstalled the app more than once but this really doesn‚Äôt help. I find a much older version on my original iPad (1st generation) works more reliably, but this is only available to me at home and can‚Äôt scan bar codes. I don‚Äôt know if this problem occurs because I have logged in for over 1060 days in a row so that my data might be unwieldy or if it is something else. Perhaps the unpaid version uses slower servers. A real shame because I started using the app to lose weight because of health issues. Would hate to finally toss it for another app."

77,Jd221322,"June 7, 2019",2,"Four Day Service Disruption I will likely change my review and hope to in time but less than two days after signing up for a premium membership, the platform went on the fritz.  There was zero proactive communication about the issues so I spent time unlinking, uninstalling, and reinstalling this app and my fitbit app thinking the issue was tied to my upgrade.  Nope.  The company was having issues that I only found out about after poking around the FAQ and troubleshooting pages after two days of the app not syncing and replicating my food entries.   The app has a notification page...this could have easily been used to flow information down to customers, both free users and premium users.  This may have also helped prevent all the unlinking and relinking backlog and the slew of angry emails the company probably received.  "
78,colkim,"August 18, 2019",2,"Good for awhile... It was a great app for a long while. I loved it and it really helped me. Then it started having issues syncing with FitBit. For months now they have been saying they are working on the problem. I have read comments from other people in their support section with the same issue. I have followed MFP‚Äôs suggestions on how to try to fix on the users end. It did not work and it seems MFP is not fixing on their end. I know something as small as a syncing issue to your exercise device may seem like not a good reason to drop the app, but seeing the fitness information really helped keep me motivated. I can use the FitBit app for all of this, but because I was a long time user of MFP it had so much set up for me that I did not want to restart somewhere else. I am sorry that I have to go elsewhere for my tracking needs. For a free app, it was good for a long time. I think, and this is just my opinion, that if you buy the upgraded version everything will miraculously work again. I will just tryout another free app and hope MFP corrects the problem."

I have used MyFitnessPal for over 6 years (have a streak of logging for 2373 days) I have seen lots of changes to the app over the years, but most recent all the push to ‚Äúpremium‚Äù and all the ads. I don‚Äôt mind having to scroll through ads knowing its free but when you start eliminating things that were in the free version that bugs me. Starting November 1, they will only store information for 2 years unless you are a premium member. I really enjoyed being able to look back at my progress and see trends (good and bad) with my health/fitness goals. Now if I want to keep that I have to pay for it. This was a no-nonsense easy way to track food/exercise that I would rave about to others. Not anymore as they have jumped in on the ‚Äúprofit first‚Äù instead of working towards general well-being for others. So bummed to see such a simple to use app change so much and become so commercialized. Keep looking if you are looking for a basic food/activity tracker for free. This one will hook you then make you pay...not worth it anymore."
80,Brandini09,"September 24, 2017",5,"Keeps Me on Track!! I have used MFP off and on for the past two years - but as of this past April and my recent engagement I have become much more committed to logging in and keeping track of my calories and nutrients. I love when I get little notifications (You have a 65 day login streak - keep it up!) and the articles and recipes on the main feed are great. I have an active job so in the past I would over eat, thinking that I burned more calories than I had because of the physicality of my job but MFP has helped me to get a better understanding of my actual activity levels and how much I am consuming. I love MFP and appreciate what it is doing for me. Finding the right foods can be frustrating at times and it does take dedication to log all your food, but if you truly want to get healthy this is a great tool to help you do so!"
81,elizabethvk16,"October 8, 2017",5,"Love it!! I absolutely love this app. It has helped me not only lose weight (40 lbs) in 5 months.. yes in a completely healthy way eating constantly (it felt like). It helped me to see everything I was doing wrong when it came to heath, and getting what I need from food to be healthy. I never would have known that my diet was lacking iron, and calcium on a daily basis it it wasn‚Äôt for My fitness pal. I would recommend this app to anyone who is trying to be healthy. It is amazing for losing weight especially when you finish logging for the day, and it tells you what you will weigh in 5 weeks ( everyone needs encouragement and it‚Äôs a great tool for that). I would recommend anyone try this app though just to look at what they really put in there body on a daily basis. Little changes in diet can change big things with health!!"

83,Akbugg44,"June 15, 2018",3,"Buggy In the past I would have reviewed this app 4 maybe even 5 stars. As of now though it is getting 3 and a review. In the past the app seemed to work flawlessly, but in the past few months the app has started to crash all of the time and it takes much more time for the app to respond when using it. I will push a button and have to wait for a bit then if it doesnt crash I can enter my food. Sometimes I will even input all my food and the app will crash then it will erase it all. Hope they can get these problems fixed. On the the other hand the app is great for counting calories and I switched to this app because you can actually have access to other people‚Äôs food diaries if you want to help someone or if maybe you are having a contest. This way you have the ability ,if you want, to follow everyones eating schedule. Overall, it is good app for what it is but it just needs to figure out the bugs."

I went from being thin and active with little appetite to gaining 40 pounds and lethargic due to PCOS.)"
85,PamolaS,"August 20, 2018",5,"Everything I need! This app has an incredible database of food. I‚Äôm impressed with the number of product specific foods and regional choices. I like being able to track my weight over time. I like being able to add exercise and water tracking. I really like seeing a breakdown of my macro and micro nutrients. I can adjust my nutritional abs weight goals easily. Adding foods to your diary gets easier as the app keeps a record of what foods you‚Äôve entered before. I‚Äôve created my own recipes and added those to the database. It‚Äôs a very user friendly program. Occasionally there are errors in the nutritional info, but that‚Äôs easy to forgive given all of the other strengths of this app.  I‚Äôve checked out a few of the other tracking apps and I find this one to be far superior.

The food database is huge, and the barcode scanning feature is very helpful. The macros help give you an idea of if you‚Äôre actually eating healthy, or just less. There should be a lot more exercises as options; they don‚Äôt even have treadmill incline options. Even paying the $50 a year, there are too many little pop-up ads and under armor ads, and it takes more taps than I‚Äôd like just to get into the program and enter my foods. The program crashes my iPhone every other day or so, as well. Other than that, measuring my foods, and writing everything down every day has been key to me losing so much weight, and this app is the best I‚Äôve found so far.

91,iviewilson,"September 24, 2017",5,"Helps to get started. I always thought it started with hitting the gym more or getting more active.. which it does. However; having someone help me figure out my macro nutrients (clueless as to even what this was...) and how they should compare to my goal(gaining weight in muscle), WAS MONUMENTAL. Fitness pal is an easy way to keep track of those numbers, and all of a sudden I'm having more success with getting into a routine. Where as before, working out and getting fit meant trying to get in the habit for a week and then taking a four month break only to do the same thing again. All over the course of 4 years or so... "

I struggle w insufficient nutrition info breakdown, insufficient Customization choices, I realize you can get more with paid version but I didn‚Äôt benefit that much because it still didn‚Äôt seem to get me some choices.  Went back to free cuz I still think the food lists are robust.  I found few inconsistencies for example avocados... if you aren‚Äôt careful it could be too much or too little.  The biggest feature I‚Äôd like to use now is a menu planning option.  Now I have to log in my food 2 times.  Once in this app, as diary, check food intake/macros/staying on track; AND again earlier during food/meal planning/shopping list.  It would be awesome if I could combine or sync, check off from plan stage to yes, I ate that as planned.  2 apps, still that might work together?  One app w added function???"

First, I‚Äôm on my feet a lot with my job, but sometimes the movement is back and forth within a few feet area. My steps aren‚Äôt counted in the tracker because I haven‚Äôt moved far enough, GPS speaking. I realize I could have another tracking device and link them, but it‚Äôs really not that important to me. It‚Äôs an observation I‚Äôve made. And my second issue is the fact that I can‚Äôt seem to delete food from the ‚Äúrecent‚Äù list. Sometimes I only eat something once, such as at a restaurant or dinner at a friend‚Äôs house. The list is getting annoyingly long. Maybe I just haven‚Äôt found out how to delete the foods yet, although, I have tried/looked several times.

The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how it adds the natural sugar from fruit into the total sugar count. It would be nice if the app could calculate natural sugar and added sugar in two different categories. If I eat like 3 different pieces of fruit during the day, have a granola bar, and maybe something sweet in the evening, it will say I have gone way over my sugar intake for the day, which isn‚Äôt true because sugar from fruit is different than added sugar from like cookies, brownies, etc. Overall, I am pleased with the app. I really like how the app has a built in barcode scanner. It makes it really easy to add food in, you don‚Äôt have to manually type everything in. I also like how you can see how many grams of fat you‚Äôve had, protein, carbs etc. Overall great app, user friendly, and it hasn‚Äôt crashed."

As I recall, one of the things I liked about that version is that the labels for each nutritional value (carbs, protein, fat, etc) were carried down the screen so that I didn‚Äôt have to constantly scroll back up to the top of the screen to see those value labels, a feature which made it much easier to analyze what I‚Äôd eaten and to make comparisons. I‚Äôve just re-upped my paid subscription and am dismayed to see that this feature is no longer present.

If you are looking for something to show you the way and take care of you like momma used to then look somewhere else; but if you want a new innovative way to hold yourself accountable and understand why you may not be seeing progress that you expected then get this app and start logging everything you eat.

My biggest problem with the app so far is that they allowed users to add data to the nutritional database, and people are STUPID. It doesn‚Äôt matter which store you bought your fresh produce from, idiot. Non-standard units for some items - how many calories are in ‚Äúa slice‚Äù of cake? Obviously incorrect data for some items - 112 calories for a half cup but 114 for a whole cup, both supposedly verified. I found myself repeatedly checking nutritional information on Wikipedia so I knew which of the wildly varying options were accurate. The barcode scan is nice because it instantly gives you the official nutritional information instead of some idiot‚Äôs estimate. I haven‚Äôt used the restaurant menu option yet.

This is the EASIEST app to monitor your calories & exercise! I love how it simple it is to scan your food or look it up in the database. This app also connects to my Fitbit and automatically lets me know how many calories I burned/how many more calories I can eat. Not only this but it shows you the breakdown of fat, protein, and carbs that you are eating. My favorite part is that if I am cooking or using a recipe you can actually paste the link from pinterest, or whichever website you got it from, scan your ingredients at home so it uses the exact ones, and this way the calories and nutritional information is correct.

It tells you how many calories you should be eating a day to get to your goal. Being able to track what you eat, how much you eat, and even add your own recipes and exercises to make the information as accurate as possible is so important.

The biggest drawback for this app is when I‚Äôm trying to report a food item for misinformation. When you report an item for misinformation, the app has us edit the info ourselves. This would‚Äôve been great if we were able to keep the changes we made. Ex: your app says an item is 100 calories but I see the nutrition label says 200 calories so I report and revise it. After revising, my diary still registers the food at 100 calories. This affects the calorie account because I‚Äôve eaten more than I should‚Äôve but the calorie count doesn‚Äôt see that.

Only when I delete the App, reinstall it and log in new, it tracks step calories for a moment, but seems to forget about it after some days. Also, no activities (calories) such a bicycling etc. coming from the Apple Watch Activity App are logged.

The makers of this app don‚Äôt realize how much that daily target goal changes my life, and messing with it like this is incredibly demoralizing, illogical, and quite frankly dangerous."
164,Jwodowpwosjdej,"June 20, 2018",4,"Good The app is really good, however I don‚Äôt really like the way it searches certain products. I love that I can scan something and there it is but when I‚Äôm trying to figure out how many calories are there in a certain dish, like fried asparagus or omelet or some sort of homemade sauce, the app gets really confusing. It may have the whole list of omelets and every single one will have a different number of calories which makes the process of counting those long and slow. "
165,J1g2a3,"July 30, 2018",1,"Your app is slow Lately the app has been running extremely slow for me. A few minutes ago I was trying to type broccoli in the search box and I eventually just gave up from how slow it was running. Scrolling down to check my macros for the day is also becoming a pain. The response time is so delayed it‚Äôs ridiculous. Occasionally it will freeze or just crash. It rarely crashes, though. "
166,ActualUser2,"December 29, 2018",3,"Great, but bugs need fixing! Great: the database contains nearly everything I‚Äôve ever searched for in my four years of use. The macros and other premium features are well worth the cost. Good: features like sharing, copying, meal creation are all very useful. BROKEN: after years of use, the app still fails to make use of the iOS icons to help in navigation and data entry. The app still fails to fully support iPhone X, leaving some buttons un-clickable. The sharing features are basically hidden (iOS icons would help where tips and support still lag behind. Finally, I‚Äôd guess that the ‚Äúoffline‚Äù notification displays about 40% of the time I open the app... is this a feature or a bug? Either way it is annoying. Overall I highly recommend this app and wish the developers would make it function more intuitively on an iPhone."
167,Gingerooney,"February 27, 2019",2,"Ridiculously complicated I used Calorie King for years with great success but the program is no longer supported and the new one is worse than this. Fitness pal is super busy and not intuitive. The screen displays are unattractive, especially on the computer, which is not congruent with the phone version. Nothing should be this hard. I want to add my food, record my exercise. I don‚Äôt want to order Under Armour clothes or read blogs. My husband has the program on his phone and side by side we look at it and the options are different from each other. We perform the same steps as a test and screen looks different. This is madness. I have the month trial of premium but not optimistic. Too much. Too convoluted. Oh and still waiting for customer service to give me the reported priority response that comes with premium. I know it‚Äôs popular but it needs some good stuff competition."
168,Ksrose11,"August 21, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs OK But... MFP is the best of what‚Äôs out there but has some serious drawbacks. To see if some of them might be diminished I tried the free month of the premium service. I was particularly looking for the opportunity to customize my nutritional goals (not just weight loss). I was hoping for the app to tell me how many calories, carbohydrates, grams of fiber, etc. I had consumed, not what I had left of the amount assigned by the software. It will let you change the amounts in your nutritional goals but it won‚Äôt keep them. It assigns 21 grams of fiber for women which is less than recommended by the NIH and other experts to maintain colon health and lose weight. I can change that to 30 grams but the next day it will be back to 21. Having to reassign my nutritional goals every day (as well as my target calories) is inconvenient and I certainly won‚Äôt pay $50 for it."
169,CorinaA81,"January 3, 2020",4,"Useful but glitchy I have used MFP since 2011. I love all of the features and use the app/website daily. Lately, it seems the glitches are becoming worse. I constantly have issues scanning barcodes when creating a recipe. The app crashes several times whenever I am trying to add foods. It also seems to be running very slowly when searching for foods, which usefully ends up in the app crashing, again. I just updated, in an effort to see if the glitches have been resolved, but I have been trying this for a while and it hasn‚Äôt seemed to help. I will continue to use MFP because it has become part of my daily routine and it offers many quality features that other similar apps do not. I‚Äôm sure all issues will be resolved eventually."

This really helps figure out strengths and opportunities in habits to help move towards goals. "
171,koarmstrong,"January 17, 2018",5,"Great app My fitness pal is a very good app for tracking food and activity whether you are trying to loose weight, maintain weight or gain weight. Logging your food and activities is simple especially when you have been doing it for awhile because it builds a list of your commonly used items. Overall a great app. I have used both the free app and the premium version and both work well depending on what you need.  I recently started tracking macros and wanted to be able to change the goals and I believe you can only do that with the paid version. Whenever I need to loose weight I have found that the only way I can do it is by tracking what I eat and this app is always what I use!"

I have never had a complaint until now. I recently started using an iPhone SE. This phone is much smaller than the new phones out there and that‚Äôs ok. I thought at first my difficulty using the back and check buttons were a result of the smaller screen. Upon further investigation using similar buttons in other apps on the phone, I realized the problem was localized to this app. Is there anything that can done to address this issue? My user experience is so frustrating as a result that I end up just logging my food from the computer which is not very convenient and negates the reason I got the app on my phone. Thank you for taking the time to read this review and hopefully resolve the issues."
173,Call_Me_Stina,"March 21, 2018",3,"Great for food tracking, works inconsistently In general, I really like this app. However, I have a constant problem logging exercise. I run every morning and in addition I strength train a couple of times a week.  Whenever I try to log two workouts in one day it does not work correctly. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a glitch or what, but sometimes after a few tries it will work and other times it won‚Äôt log no matter how many times I try. Also I sometimes have trouble syncing it with my Apple watch to track steps. Sometimes it works fine, other times I have to un-sync it, re-sync it, delete it, add it, etc. Other than that, I love the food logging capabilities and they do have an expansive list of foods to track calories. I just wish I could consistently log exercise and steps accurately more consistently."

Every time I unsubscribed, I‚Äôd get two new emails from different companies. Despite unsubscribing from Under Armor no less than TEN time, I kept getting emails from them, sometimes once a day, sometimes five times a day. I wrote to them and asked about not only their own email, but also all the other companies. They denied selling my info and in a less than helpful way, told me to go to me ‚ÄúMy Fitness Pal‚Äù app and manage my emails. I did this and did it help? Nope. I threatened legal action and it finally stopped. THEN a news story about how this company had a data breach that they hide until they couldn‚Äôt hide it any longer.

I had an issue where I couldn‚Äôt access my account and was forced to create a new one and in turn losing all of my tracking info, but also access to my premium account. Not only did they help me with the issue by looking for my original account and giving me the information that I needed, but they also helped me update my account on their end and got me my premium access back. Just for the fact that there is people willing to actually help customers resolve an issue, makes this app 100% worth it to me."
176,Mirandammoser,"January 11, 2019",2,"Great if you want to lose weight in an unhealthy way. The calorie suggestions are waaaay lower than what you should be eating. It‚Äôs a great app if you‚Äôre looking to lose a lot of weight by a certain deadline but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for long term use. It may take account of any workouts you do and give you a net amount of calories, but since there isn‚Äôt really a way to calculate how many of those calories were fat/carbs/sugar"
177,Mim1007,"June 18, 2019",2,"Not as easy as I‚Äôd hoped I do a lot of cooking from scratch. This app does allow you to create a recipe, so that you don‚Äôt have to type in the individual ingredients every time you make a family favorite, however, finding the appropriate ingredient from their list is very time consuming, and sometimes impossible. For example, my recipe called for 1/4 cup of sugar. My choices from their list included 1 tsp sugar about a dozen times. The difference in these 1 tsp options was based on the brand of sugar I was using, like Dominos, or a store brand, or whether I spelled teaspoon, tsp, or 1 packet. None of these options make it easy to create a recipe that uses 1/4 cup. Sure, I know that 1/4 cup equals 16 tsps, but who has time to type this into a recipe 16 times?!? And who cares which brand I use? It‚Äôs all the same amount of calories! And, there wasn‚Äôt 1 single option for 1/4 cup. Deleting and trying a different app."
178,MinnaB,"June 11, 2019",1,Spams you to stalk you - disrespects your privacy The first thing you see when you open this app is a request to track your location. They claim this is to share location-specific offers. But I do not need offers specific to which street to track calories and exercise. My Fitness Pal and Under Armor need it to track my movements and sell them to advertisers. They were recently hacked too - I also don‚Äôt want cybercriminals to have a record of my every move.
179,Drew in Cumming,"September 24, 2019",5,"No More Tracking Points!!! I love this app! I have tried all kinds of different diets and it has always been to keep track of certain things (ie. ‚ÄúPoints‚Äù) in order to be successful. This app makes it painless and I absolutely love the idea of scanning barcodes‚Ä¶ this app actually puts in all the nutrition information for just one serving automatically! It is so easy to bump it up to two servings, if that‚Äôs the case. I eventually decided to try the premium addition as it breaks down the nutrients even further to show you exactly what you are consuming and how much - spectacular! Finally, it synchronizes with my Fitbit app which saves even more time as it automatically puts in the correlating information."
180,Arizona_Allens,"September 9, 2017",3,Great App. Ads overtake it's usefulness. I began using this app in 2013 because my personal trainer could partner with me and see my diary entries. I'd be in a tough workout set and struggling with a repetition when she'd mention how easily I lifted that extra order of chicken wings the other day - stuff like that! 
181,BeeHivey33,"November 18, 2017",5,"Definitely recommend This app has changed my life! It's the easiest way for me to keep track of my calories because I hate counting calories. I also keep track of my macros (which I've. Ever done before) I've been using it for a week and have lost about 3lbs. It's been very easy to incorporate into my routine and helps me stay on target overall. I love the supportive message when I complete my daily diary, I.e. ""If everyday was like today, you'd weigh xyz in 5 weeks"". This message at the end of each day has been encouraging and motivating to me. Keeping a log of my daily food habits has also helped me overcome obstacles towards healthy eating  because it allows me to identify and find insight to my eating habits"
182,Nushmut,"March 28, 2019",2,"Data integration is unreliable. Ads never fail to display. Movement and workout data that have already synced to my iPhone from my Watch frequently seem to disappear when I open the MFP app during the day.

184,Stuck in Japan,"May 19, 2019",4,"Easy to track, but not everything This app makes it great to track what you‚Äôre eating. Save money on expensive diet plans and fad diets and just go back to basics with this. It takes a little time to figure out how to navigate a first, not the most user friendly design but for the most part everything you want to track is there. My one big complaint and the reason this app gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn‚Äôt allow you to add calories instead of searching by food name. Sometimes the calorie count when you search is incorrect and it would be much easier and quicker if there was a feature that allowed you to manually enter calories. Also think water should be with the meal area. That‚Äôs it."
185,Vinimini_v,"June 6, 2019",2,"Great for logging food, syncing inconsistent I have used MFP for years, and I‚Äôve never had a complaint. I love that they‚Äôve added menus to make things easier. They have a wide range of options for saving meals, uploading and creating recipes, etc. I also appreciate the ease of using all of the features. My only, and biggest complaint is that it just no longer syncs my steps from my Fitbit. I have it marked to do so, have removed the app, revoked access and added it again. When reaching out I basically got a shrug and a reply that things don‚Äôt work perfectly all the time, which I completely understand. However it only works 10% of the time, and I have also seen several other complaints. It would be nice if a fix pack or something could be sent out. Things from MFP sync perfectly fine with the Fitbit app, it is only an issue from the Fitbit app to MFP."
186,JessKikaKeeks,"August 15, 2019",2,Many Glitches and Bugs! I‚Äôve been a user of this app for a long time and I even subscribed to their premium option for an entire year and loved it. I mainly use it now for simply tracking calories and tryingggg to create recipes and figuring out the calories in said recipes. The create recipes option NEVER syncs with the server. EVER. It does save it. SOMETIMES. However the option to save and log simultaneously NEVER works for me. Sometimes the app will close and just kick me out. This all started happening after I cancelled my premium subscription a few months ago because before that I don‚Äôt remember having these issues. I deleted it and tried downloading it again to see if that solved anything but it won‚Äôt even let me log back in or change my password. I am trying a different calorie tracking app. Sad because I‚Äôve been using this one for years.

But in that short amount of time it has shown itself to be very user-friendly and very informative when you are entering everything of your exercise and diet. Even your snacks, water intake etc. It has a very easy to use search engine that quickly finds food and snacks that are exactly or very similar to what you just ate. The whole data entry process is quick and easy. In my view so far this makes it a very effective tool to track your calorie intake and calorie burning through your exercises, which you can also enter in this app. We wish we had known about this a long time ago. üëçüèºüòé"

190,dcuellar44,"December 8, 2017",4,Why did I have to try this? Now I have to get the premium to unlock the rest of the features. I decided I was going to get out of the Fitbit ecosystem due to their refusal to work with Apple‚Äôs HealthKit. Going to try the Nokia scale and this app now instead. So far everything works really well and it seems like their database is more robust. The free version has everything I need but I would like to try premium as some of the features I think would be beneficial. My only concern with this is the price. That‚Äôs a lot of money. I would have preferred the idea of a lifetime membership at a higher cost. I‚Äôve looked over the features and I don‚Äôt think the price currently is justifiable.

Then all of a sudden my mom started losing a bunch of weight as well as my sister and it gave me hope. I talked to my sister and she told me to log my calories on My Fitness Pal.

192,Fun yun,"April 26, 2018",2,Please fix your issues fitnesspal It doesn‚Äôt seem like they care about the accuracy of their nutritional content. There is no way to flag a bad item incorrectly listed. For example McDonald‚Äôs chicken nuggets have multiple listings with different calorie counts. This is true even when you enter the proper amount of nuggets consumed. I have also been over charging calories I consumed eating pistachios they have them listed with the shells and then nutritional content on the packaging clearly states without shells. Why is there not a checkbox to flag a bad item?

So now I need to go back and redo all that? Cause it took a long time. No thanks. Also, I needed to go back and adjust the number of servings for said recipe but last time I tried to do that I also had to start over.

The app should auto save as you go, so if you hit the back button, phone crashes/dies, have to close app for some reason, etc, it saves where you were at. I make a lot of meals from scratch, and vary them up often, so use the recipe function a lot to save meals, and then can tweak them later and make duplicate versions when I make it over and over with variations. The app def is easier if you tend to eat pre made or packaged food. If each meal is from scratch and varies in prep, it adds up to an hour a day in data entry, which i‚Äôm not sure is sustainable."

But being able to import the recipes found online is awesome. Just make sure you edit the ingredients it pulls because sometimes it uses higher calorie foods then what you may have used.

It is the best way to keep track of all your calories, macros and log exercise for each day.  Easy to use. The more you use it, the easier it gets because all your most recently logged entries are at your fingertips.  You can scan UPC codes for entering food items as well.  There is great tips for losing weight and staying focused on the home page.  It is updated with all the latest exercise and diet tips.  I have lost 85 pounds in 7 months!  Could I have done it without my fitness pal?  Yes... but it would have been way more difficult to track all the calories and exercise"

I‚Äôm obsessed with the barcode scanning feature as it has  made food logging so much easier. The articles that are featured on the app everyday are informative and interesting.

I created all my food items rather than the lookup or bar scan. I only entered calories and none of the other nutritional info. You see, being a type 2 diabetic and watching only carbs for years had gotten me into this unfit situation. Concentrating on calories has brought my blood sugar into control and reduced my reliance on medication. In less than five months my fitness has turned around.

Since getting seriously focused on changing my body composition, and losing weight, I've used the app again as a daily guide. In the first 30 days I've lost 13 lbs, and I'm on my way to my goal of losing 50 lbs.

MyFitnessPal helps me to make better food choices every day, and speaking as a person who has struggled with food management my entire adult life, it‚Äôs exactly what I needed.    When people ask me how I did it (and after such a dramatic weight loss, a LOT of people are asking) I tell them MyFitnessPal.  I also enjoy the blogs, recipes and exercise tips.

About a year and 3 months ago I made the decision to actually commit to tracking my macros by using this app... it has worked wonders for me when I eat clean and when I‚Äôve chosen to work eat dirty. The app itself has cool features. Scanning items is a life saver and if you flip the phone whilst viewing your diary for the day you can view your macro breakdown.

It‚Äôs a huge factor when watching the amount of carbs you‚Äôre eating.  Since this is a nutrition app as well, then it should have that calculation as well as glucose for those that need that.  If you‚Äôre going to ask a monthly fee to use the macros part then you should have those things included in the app. To say ‚Äúat this time‚Äù you don‚Äôt have it is ridiculous especially with what you‚Äôre charging per month.

My only complaint is that I had days that I ate very healthy at significantly higher portions than I was eating junk food and my calorie count wouldn‚Äôt be sufficient. This is not the apps fault obviously, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me close out the day. I was not starving myself- by any means- and it would give me a message as if I was if I was 200 calories short at the end of the day.

I won‚Äôt use store bought Salsa with high sodium content and God knows what else. I will make the stuff myself with tomatillo, garlic, Jalape√±o, onion, and cilantro and save it as a recipe to use in a Chicken Tomatillo Casserole. In a perfect world with perfect apps, maybe. Each time I save a recipe to use in another recipe it is unavailable in my ingredient search. The same would apply to sauces and spice blends that are used in my kitchen.

Even if you manually add exercises in that you do, the app cannot track calories burned or sync with the Apple Watch activity app to help get an accurate count for the day.

After emailing the company four times to request that my account and personal data be deleted, they finally responded to note that they would review my request. I never received a response, and although I have attempted to contact their customer care team additional times, these requests have gone unanswered. So, just be aware.

The only way to enter food for items that I haven‚Äôt eaten in the past few weeks is to manually enter every time or scan the barcode.

My favorite thing is how the app reminds you if you forget to log a meal. The app also makes it so easy to log your foods. A really cool feature is the calculation it does after you complete your food diary for the day, where it lets you know what your likely weight would be in 5 weeks depending on your eating habits for the day.

I used MyFitnessPal for many years on and off when I needed to be really diligent in tracking calories, macros, etc for diet purposes. It was great to create custom foods and it saved commonly eaten foods for meals so that you could add them quickly. It also has a super handy barcode scanner to quickly add nutrition info. "
263,momof2er,"February 24, 2019",5,"Love it, but... I have used this app for about 10 years on and off. It always helps me lose weight if I use it every day. There are great tips for exercising and delicious recipes. I have recently lost 20 pounds (again) using the app. I decided not to stop even when I lost the weight. I usually stop using the app when I get to goal. I switched my goal to maintenance and my calories went from 1200 to 1900 daily calories!!!!! That is insane! If I eat even 1500 calories I will gain quickly. This has been my only issue. To counteract this I changed my goal to lose 1 pound and my calories were much more reasonable. Overall, I love this app!!!"
264,lukeherda,"April 17, 2019",5,"MyFitness Pal I really think this is the best app on the market for tracking macronutrients. Very user friendly. I would say over 95 percent of the items I scan are found and directly match the labels. You are able to create recipes too which is nice. You can always find a good article to read as well in the blog portion of the app. Tracking weight and progress is supported by a nice line graph to help visualize progress. Occasional crash but no reason to knock the app for that, all apps crash. I do think adding a calculator to the app would do wonders for those tracking food intake very specifically. Is that something that will ever happen?"

Every time it happens I think, ‚Äúwelp, this is it.‚Äù The issue is there‚Äôs no easy way to export data, so  because the app has reliability issues, I end up logging everything twice, once in MFP and once somewhere else, to ensure I‚Äôll have a backup when MFP finally folds."

On the other hand, if I save calories during the day, I can have that measured treat at night.  I love that I can create meals as I eat the same thing for breakfast every day.  I also like that MFP keeps foods I eat on a list so I don‚Äôt have to search from scratch to add foods.  The articles are also helpful and full of good ideas.

268,AFBrian2002,"September 8, 2019",4,"A good App with poorly thought out font color I‚Äôve used this app for years, I like it.  But when they changed some font colors on the app, those colors are now so close to the background color as to make them difficult to see or in my case, impossible to see.  Rule of thumb, if the font seems to close in contrast to its background, its going to be difficult for those with normal vision and nearly impossible for those with poor color vision.  There is a reason for tests where close color contrasts are used.  Those tests will weed out people with color vision impairments, therefore making your app very difficult to use.  Please go back through the app and increase the color contrast."

270,Susie the stupid,"January 18, 2018",3,Tracking calories from black coffee makes me want to suicide The interface is blue and like a boys elementary school locker room. The ads are for senior citizens and I‚Äôm not a senior but can‚Äôt get rid of them unless I go premium. I can‚Äôt connect to my scale because that partner app is missing. And then the final straw is that it tracks the protein and calories in my plain black coffee. Apparently 3 cups of black coffee have 7 cal and .1 g of fat. I don‚Äôt want to go to weight watchers again but I feel like I might need to because this is depressing. I want to give it one star but that is not really very nice because obviously a lot went into this. I really really wish it was more likable and user-friendly. Oh and the branded challenge with the cereal company is just weird and sad. Good luck y‚Äôall.

Now, a video pops up EVERY TIME I want to make an entry. For example, if I‚Äôm entering more than one meal or more than one food, I have to deal with a 20-30 second video delay for every entry. That‚Äôs just too much.  Look, the app does a good job of helping me track nutrients, calories, etc. And it works ok with my Fitbit. But I won‚Äôt pay for it. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs worth anywhere near what you‚Äôre charging. Ive been a MFP user for about 5 years and I‚Äôm less and less happy with it each year.

So this morning I had 18g grams of dietary fiber and 4g carbs, and since my goal is to stay below 20g of (net) carbs, and the app only considers total carbs, I‚Äôm getting notifications that I‚Äôve surpassed my goal (as if I‚Äôm doing something wrong), except I am completely within my daily net carbs allowance, and am actually doing fantastic in fiber.

This app really breaks it all down and the numbers don‚Äôt lie. If you‚Äôre serious, or even just at all curious, about getting healthy.. track your food. Do it for a week. See what happens.

I also tells you if you went over and by how much. I use this app on both my iPhone and laptop both ways were simple and fun. I believe it a step in the right direction but I want help unless you have self motivation. Yes I recommend it for use and I‚Äôll continue to use it but it not being free would be my only complaint."

What I found is that there was a possible glitch with my actual account and/or having the app on multiple devices caused too much confusion and the connection and was deleting various foods that I had posted.

I can determine ahead of time what I plan to eat and work with it. I can even have cake or a beer and still stay within my calorie intake if I plan it right. If I go over I can earn back the calories through exercise. It links with the step tracker on your phone, you can record activities or link it with your Fitbit.

Carbs and protein count as 4 calories per gram and fats count as 9 calories per gram. If you check your numbers at the end of the day on the app, it is wrong. In my case, I was short about 130 calories. I addressed this with tech help, and they blamed it on the user error of people entering wrong macro and calorie info. This is incorrect and laziness on tech help‚Äôs part. I am canceling my subscription and will not pay for an app that does not do what it is advertised to do. I would not recommend this app if you are serious about your diet and nutrition goals. The margin of error is too high to reach your nutrient goals successfully."

I have loved the app, but this made me livid. I have had stomach issues in the past, and logging and noting changes in my health has been very important to me and in just a second, I lost all of it.

The App Gives me that extra push to pick the tea instead of the latte, or if I do have the latte, I am able to see what I will have to say no to instead or how much I will need to work out to make up for it.

Otherwise there are plenty of search recipes to choose from just be sure that you get the spelling correct. The only problem I have with it is it shows too many calories burned for steps taken.

This kept all my macro and micro nutrient in checks and i could also see my vitamin consumption. This really works if you use it properly and set goals and try to be within a good range of your target, losing weight is easy. The best part is you don‚Äôt have to enter things every time. Snap a barcode or choose a ready made meal and you can easily approximate how much nutrients you are getting. Very accurate. Be honest with yourself and this will pay off within 2 months guarantee you can lose 10-15 pounds."

However, you can only have credit for Steps or your activity but NOT both. For example Cleaning the Kitchen isn‚Äôt even listed as an activity. There is other cleaning options available. As soon as you list an activity you lose all credit for your Steps. You can use a Treadmill for an hour & as soon as list Food Preparation you 100+ Calories for your Steps are ZERO OUT. This App may not give credit for the calories burned but my body knows I walked up & down the basement stairs for 10 round trips & then I spent 30 minutes on the treadmill even if this App don‚Äôt give me the credit."

So easy to track your meals! And not only that, just yesterday we were eating lunch at Denny‚Äôs and out of curiosity I tried to see if the app would have any meals registered and it has them all! I started my journey of loosing weight with another app but it was so hard to manually add all the ingredients of my meals, but when I found this one everything changed. It takes me only seconds to add a meal. Easy to use, amazing tool and so affordable. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough."

I will add items into recipes from my phone and they do not save. I will then go and attempt to adjust recipes from my laptop and these changes save, but do not update on the phone application. This is beyond frustrating and an ongoing issue. Stop bugging me to purchase a premium subscription when basic functionality consistently fails.

This app gives you the power to do that. The reading content is easy to apply immediately to any lifestyle. You don't have to be a gym rat. This is for everyone. The only update I would like to see is a water consumption tracker badge notification on my phone. Their water tracker is just that, but it doesn't remind me or help me drink more water."
321,rec4theages,"November 22, 2017",5,Keeps you accountable When I decided to get serious about my health after a longtime neglect I implemented the use of this app. It was a great way for me to keep an eye on not only my total caloric intake but also on my macros. Because the app also takes into account your daily fitness it encourages the user to also perform more activity/exercise daily as well. The ease of the app is a result of its vast food library which saves time when inputting calories. Before the app I would write down all my daily calories; this has made it sooo much easier. Great app! Since March I have gone from 242lbs to 198lbs.

I enjoy using the app. I‚Äôve been on and off with tracking my diet, I like that all my information is saved regardless of having deleted the app many times. I would love for this app‚Äôs premium features to be free. This is really the only major downside to the app. One room for improvement is that the app limits itself to track the amount of steps for exercise when the Apple Watch is connected to the app. I believe by connecting to the Apple Watch and the iPhone Activity app it should be able to track heart rate and various other parameters of exercise. Otherwise, I recommend this app for personal dietary use!"
323,Capoeirista Chick,"January 7, 2018",3,"Does not consider vitamins This app has great potential but because it associates with only gains/losses (a very surface understanding of health), it shuts out an entire audience of people trying to be healthy instead of just trying to change the way they look.

It super useful for tracking your macros as well and warns you when you‚Äôre in danger of eating too much sugar, sodium, or fat. It has helpful articles regularly, as well as recipes. I love the Twitter/Facebook vibe it gives you on the main page as well. Overall this app is AMAZING, for real.

I found it so easy to follow. It lets you know how many calories you need to eat to gain or lose x amount of pounds per week. You just enter the food and it tells you how many calories it has & it keeps track of how many you have consumed and how many you have left for the day. I‚Äôve found every food that I entered without fail. I love it & I plan on continuing now that I‚Äôve lost the extra weight so that I can learn the right foods to eat to maintain it.

For the last two weeks there has been several problems. MyFitnessPal got hacked, it would sync with Fitbit (tried server alert times and methods) AND it won‚Äôt recognize my password. I‚Äôve had to reset/change my password at least 5 times. Not sure it‚Äôs worth the time and frustration. June 27: The original problem with not syncing got fixed, BUT the same problem is happening (several days now), even though they just did an update.

I‚Äôm not sure what happened within the last couple of years, but it‚Äôs gotten much slower. I‚Äôm now at the point where it sometimes takes 2 minutes to load to the point where I can effectively track calories and even then the app stays slow, with long awkward pauses accompanying most activities and the screen frequently becoming unresponsive. What used to be a quick and easy way to track calories has turned into a chore, destroying any value the app can hope to bring. "

Rather than an individual helping they just send an email with a so many paragraphs on how to solve your problem and when none of that works it takes them days to respond.

For example my wife and I are both using this app and we eat the same meals for the most part. We unfortunately both have to individually enter the meals or the components that make up the meals instead of just being able to share what the other has already entered. That‚Äôs the only reason I didn't give it a 5. It seems like a simple solution that could probably help a lot of your users.

It's not really healthy, but without I imagine I would be in worse condition. So thanks. This app is a lifesaver. It makes me feel good when I exercise too and see how it affects my numbers.

It's not much to look at, and does a few simple core functions.  Therein lies the genius.  Commit a week to getting into the habit of recording everything you eat and each time you exercise, and you'll get why it's so great for those who just don't realize how much they stuff in their face. It's amazing how much I was overeating.  Also, you need to buy an accurate scale or the functionality will be severely limited.

Then there is the spam pop ups if using the desktop version (which sometimes I still resort to because the app is so glitchy). This all began with the expansion of the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feature (don‚Äôt even get me started on that).

Not having a barcode scanner is frustrating because it‚Äôs easier to input that information but the barcode scanner and on the other app my Lifesum doesn‚Äôt always work properly and the measurements that it gives you don‚Äôt always equal the measurements that you are eating (ie cups, tablespoons, ounces etc).

Also, it would be awesome on the premium version if when you look at your nutrition for the day and click on say fiber or vitamin A it lists different healthy options for getting more of what you guys suggest we need more of like for fiber prunes for example or berries. It would save me a lot of time because at this point I see what I‚Äôm lacking in, then I have to google what I can eat to get me on track when it would be so much easier and helpful for you guys to add a link to each one showing your healthy suggestions."

The only thing that bothers me is that as a free app is very limited unless you pay a yearly fee. I would love it more if it could have a one time payment and that‚Äôs it.

The app contains copious amounts of information regarding caloric intake, exercise tips, nutrition, and recipes. I especially enjoy ability to track calories and record them with such ease. The listing of exercises is especially helpful as well as the ability to add exercise that is not included in the listings. I will say the very small negative is there is no access to calories burned in the strength section. With that being said I will create the exercise and add to the cardio section then use a exercise calculator to find the burned calories for that specific exercise. Thanks for a great app indeed."

Too many advertisements. Biggest grievance: Why does it take me to the Home page every time I open the app? It should take me to the meal I want to log depending on the time of day. The main reason for using this app is to log food. It takes way too many clicks to add an item which deters people from logging after a while. I use force touch to add meals but it often pulls up the home page. Way too many things to click through to add a item. Developers need to return to basics and make it easier / quicker to log food.

Then when I could wake up in the morning, I could set if it‚Äôs a gym day, cardio day, or rest (etc). Then my calories and macros for the day could change accordingly.

365,mb1588,"June 4, 2019",1,"A Bloated, Buggy, Battery-Draining Mess As a long-time user of this app, I am saddened at how little it has improved over the years. The database can rarely be depended on, including the entries that are allegedly verified; and unfortunately there are many weird interface quirks and bugs that make manual data entry unnecessarily difficult. Once you manage to actually make an entry, though, there are constant syncing errors. Then, if the app is open long enough (and it will be if you care about accurately entering data) your phone will overheat or the app will just crash. It‚Äôs weird how this app always seems to have a new update, yet none of these problems are ever fixed. The only reason I still use the app is because it has years of my data. I‚Äôm not sure that is a good enough reason anymore."
366,Craigrm1985,"June 8, 2019",2,"Does NOT sync to Fitbit I‚Äôve had this application for 10 days, and the last 6 days it has not linked any information with all Fitbits. I am giving 2 stars for the fact I like how easy it is to update food eaten to track calories eaten. However without seeing the calories burned, steps walked, and weight losses from Fitbit.. this application is useless. I will be finding another app that can do more. "
367,Fitness pal lover,"December 21, 2019",5,Getting the baby weight off I need to really see the numbers when I am trying to lose weight. I have 20 more lbs to lose and they are the hardest. I signed up for a DietBet and use my fitness pal to help me track my calories so I can lose weight and win my bet! If I come in each day at a deficiency in calories I know I‚Äôm doing a good job. If I go a little heavy at lunch it makes me think again about how big of a dinner I have. When I do a good long workout I feel so good because I pair the app with my Apple Watch and know it‚Äôs accurate. With dedication and patience the weight will come off.
368,Dog moms,"February 29, 2020",5,Best dieting and exercise log I have been with a weight loss group for a year and do 90 min of swim 3 days a wk for past 3 years. I had lost 5 pounds.   The second week using free version of this ap I lost 6 pounds. 13 since I started using the ap 3 weeks ago.  It takes a little bit to learn but once you get the hang of it it is fabulous    Best ap   I am so happy.  Thank you under armor   Please  don‚Äôt change anything about the free version.  It is life saving to me right now.   If I had the money though I do think the paid version would be worth every dime and I would get it.
369,Ducks in Row,"February 11, 2020",5,"Unbelievable! I wouldn‚Äôt have believed it if it wasn‚Äôt my own body!  I started using this app at the beginning of June. 3 months later I had lost the 20 pounds I wanted to lose and without feeling hungry or tired! In fact, I was energized and slept better than I had in years!  What a change in my body! I had to get rid of most of my clothes as I dropped from size 8 back to size 2, which is where I should be at 5‚Äô1‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt seen this weight since before I had my 2 kids 24 years ago. Thanks to MyFitnessPal, my lifestyle has changed and I love feeling ‚Äúme‚Äù again!"
370,TREV1242,"September 21, 2017",5,Take control of your life! MyFitnessPal is an amazing app that I would recommend to ANYONE! It helps you learn so much about what you put into your body and allows you to objectively see that you are in track to meet your goals. This app has changed my life forever as it has already helped me lose 30 pounds and 17% body fat! It takes the worry out of the equation and I never wonder if I'm eating the right amount of food or if I'm getting enough protein. Losing weight and body fat is simple if you eat in a calorie deficit. Eating in a calorie deficit is simple if you use MyFitnessPal!

It‚Äôs improved tremendously from what I remember, I love that it has recipe suggestions and fitness tips. I also like that you can input recipes in and it will calculate the calories for you and you can add it to your diary. I also love the scan option it makes things so much easier to input. It is really helpful in keeping myself on track and accountable for what I eat. I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for an easy foolproof way to track your calories, exercise, etc."

I'm not starving I'm adding in some of my good stuff, but I'm watch how I'm adding it and calculating if it's worth it to me and the rest of my eating for the day. If you are struggling like I was use this app. It works if you work it üòÉ"
374,Reiammy,"March 14, 2018",5,"Great Features Having used the Fitbit and Noom apps to log meals in the past, MyFitnessPal is definitely the best. I pay for the premium features and they are worth it so far. My favorite feature is the daily reminder that if you are every day like this, you‚Äôd weigh X in five weeks. It really helps keep me on track. The sync with Fitbit is seamless so the app automatically adjusts my calories if I walk more. The ability to track nutrients and protein is very helpful and I use it daily. The only thing I have found missing from the app is the ability to edit a saved meal."
375,Space Kitty Alvarez,"July 6, 2018",1,"Um... why? I‚Äôm 14 and can‚Äôt use the app?? I mean I get it if the age limit was maybe 13+, but this I don‚Äôt get. There are so many teens out there who want to stay fit. And honestly, it‚Äôs most critical to stay fit and develop good, healthy habits during teen years, especially considering this is when most of the physical and brain development is occurring. I strongly suggest that you rethink your choice of only allowing people 18 and up to sign up. I really hope that you take this into consideration. I was super excited when I found out what this app could be used for and it has such great reviews. However, the excited vanished as soon as I met this sudden issue of not being able to make an account. Please rethink this. Thank you for putting aside time to read this; your response would be greatly appreciated."
376,Overcomingobstacles,"August 9, 2018",5,"Great App, but...could you add this option? Such a user friendly, awesome app to food intake and track macros One suggestion, is it possible to add an option to see nutrition (calories/macros) over a flexible set of days set by the user? Right now the only option is by a given day or adjustable week of seven days by date. I would find it more useful to be able to set it, for example, a set of my last four (or whatever number) of days to see my calories/macro averages rather than being limited to one day or seven days. Thanks for any consideration to this! Love the app!"
377,Jcandhugo,"May 23, 2019",3,"Updates kill your tracking I love this app and would give it 5 stars, but there are some issues. I hate that with every update all of my previous entries are gone. It‚Äôs so frustrating to know you are taking then time to enter everything and then it disappears. I like to be able to look back and see what my food intake was. It also helps me track migraine triggers. So fixing that would be nice. "
378,-Rena-,"February 8, 2020",5,"Love it! This app is extremely user friendly. I love that they have recipes included, they show nutrition as well as your macros. I think their premium version is extremely overpriced but if you have $80 to kill you can get a years worth for an extremely discounted rate compared to their month-to-month. If you are honest with yourself and record EVERYTHING you eat, you will see results! It has only been a week but i lost 5 pounds and feel really good! It has also shown me what foods to stop eating in order to better balance my meals. Highly recommend!!!!!"
379,MaddiG1,"June 16, 2019",1,I‚Äôm confused. I got this app to help me on my weight loss journey. I thought it would be best for me to track my food as I have trouble of over eating and all. I haven‚Äôt gotten any other apps or gone on any other website to help me yet so I needed to sign up. I put what I need for the first two or three slides of signing up (I signed up with email) but when it comes to the page for me telling my birthday and gender and all I click the arrow and it keeps saying it can‚Äôt make my registration at the moment or something. So I was like okay and tried a few more times and it said the same thing. It is now the next day and I‚Äôm trying to sign up and it won‚Äôt let me. Is it my age? Did I do something wrong? Is it my WiFi? I even turned on my data to see if that would work. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm confused.
380,amyb3517,"October 12, 2017",5,"Great app. Good solid information In the world of fake news, its nice to know the information in the app, despite being based on user input, is (for the most part) accurate. You should still check any info that seems too goo to be true (12 oreos are NOT 50 calories!), but with a bit if searching you can find what works for you. If you are using it regularly, its gets very easy to use and is GREAT for keeping track of what you REALLY eat- in real time! You can project out your meals for the day, or even a few days ahead and make your goals more attainable!"
381,penelope227,"February 20, 2018",5,"Great fitness app! I have tried so many apps to help me count calories, track workouts, and monitor nutrition and by far, this app is the best I have ever used. I have lost 10 pounds using this app. It‚Äôs easy to use, straight forward format, and I love that I can scan things and it automatically logs it in. I recommend this for anyone wanting to lose weight or maintain their weight. It also breaks down protein, carbs, and fat. It has really opened my eyes to things I would usually eat on a daily basis that might not be as healthy as I thought. Try this app! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
382,fitjude,"April 3, 2018",2,"Loved this app until ... Until today. I‚Äôve been using this app for years. In fact, I even upgraded to the paid version. I‚Äôve done a series of fitness competitions and it was great for tracking my macros. "
383,Taurusandboar,"July 27, 2018",5,"I am addicted to using this app I am trying to trim the body fat, and have used several different fitness and food apps with disappointing results. However, I have found my true love. What I deeply appreciate about this app is (1) it has a huge inventory of foods to track the nutritional information of the foods I eat (like the brand of airplane snacks on my Delta flight, and my favorite red wine), (2) it tracks macros and lets me customize my macro goals, (3) it‚Äôs fairly intuitive to use, and (4) it connects to Apple‚Äôs Health app. And that‚Äôs just after two days of using. Thank you Under Armour."
384,spidey69,"May 3, 2019",5,Safety net for weight loss I have used my fitness pal for three years now and it has been the best for maintaining and losing weight there is literally nothing in its database that you can‚Äôt find to find the calories the amounts and even after you lose enough weight where you‚Äôre happy and helps you feel good that you‚Äôre not deviating keep you honest and it‚Äôs simple and easy to use I love it and I highly recommend it once you get the weight off you can use it more casually and not as strict and it never let you get too far away from your goals
385,Rivera guitar amps are best,"May 26, 2019",5,"Foods Database! I tried multiple dieting apps before settling on this one. They all have their strengths but this one has the most complete and most accurate database of foods. I have learned that is the most important feature of these apps. In eight months of daily use I have found only three foods with an error. The only three foods I didn‚Äôt find were from Costco, which carries custom versions of products. But almost all Costco foods have been in the database. I have lost 42 pounds since switching to this app, which is exactly on target for meeting my goals."
386,Austidrs,"February 14, 2020",4,"Notifications are whack This app is great. It helps me so much with tracking my calories as well as goals. And I am so appreciative of that and all of the other great features. Unfortunately, I had to turn notifications off because they don‚Äôt work properly. I get a notification for every meal saying ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt logged your meal‚Äù. However, most of the time I actually have logged my meal. So, it‚Äôs annoying. It would be helpful in the event I actually forgot to log a meal, but I can‚Äôt stand unnecessary notifications. Hoping this gets resolved so I can use the notifications in the event I do actually forget to log a meal."
387,tazeman32,"January 3, 2020",4,"Great app I have been using the app for over a year using the premium version. I really enjoy using this app to track my food intake.  Great articles & videos to help you with learning more about food, exercise & more.  App works great on the iPhone & iPad. Also like how it sync with Apple Health app & Activity app. I have had some challenges with the recipes downloading but eventually get them to work. For the app, under the food diary, I wish the column that are titled Calories, Carbs, Fat, etc were static so as you scroll down.  I always have scroll back up to remember which column is which. Hopefully that can be a future update."
388,Blackilocks,"December 18, 2019",4,"Love the app, wish it wouldn‚Äôt crash so often I‚Äôve become very fond of this app over the past few months. It takes the guesswork out of weight loss and puts you in control of all the factors. My only complaint is that it crashes all the time when I‚Äôm using the computer version of the app. This usually happens when I‚Äôve pressed the ‚Äúquick add calories‚Äù button, but it happens other times too. Sometimes I‚Äôll try to start the app on my computer and there‚Äôs a message for several hours that the app is down. I really wish they could fix this problem, because it‚Äôs a great app."
389,Bec‚Äôs Crafts,"September 1, 2019",5,"Great for casual weight loss I downloaded the app to help track my exercise and calories while I tried to lose a few pounds this summer.  I was pleasantly surprised by how easy and comprehensive it was.  It has a very large searchable list of foods and a barcode scanner that makes logging meals take seconds.  I don‚Äôt yet fully understand the calorie adjustments but after using the app for 2 months I can say that it really helped me manage what I ate.  For someone like me who‚Äôs just wanting to lose a little weight or gradually get onto a healthier life style, the app is really helpful."
390,Bfabinc,"October 23, 2017",5,"Really works! If you are willing to take the little time it takes to enter what you are eating each day, this app makes losing weight easy. By giving you nutritional information, you can make better choices before eating a meal that throws your calories and nutritional values over the allotted amounts. You still have to decide to eat healthy foods and it helps to add exercise into your lifestyle. But after years of trying to lose weight with no success, I‚Äôve lost 24 pounds in about 6 1/2 months. I highly recommend this app. It really works!"

Over the past three months of use, this app continually doubles up my macros and calories in Apple health which affects other apps I‚Äôm using to track my health. This seems to happen on a completely random basis. After submitting multiple reports to tech support I only get a generic reply back thanking me for my feedback and someone will be in touch. Apparently MFP developers have known about this since October 2017 and still haven‚Äôt fixed it. Requires the user to continually double check Apple health data against what is reported in MFP. This app is garbage at the moment and not worth the 9.99 Per month. If you are going to charge me for it, at least make the thing work. Very disappointing."

However, the most recent release‚Äôs constant pestering about providing fine-grained location services is very user-hostile: if a user tells the app ‚Äúno‚Äù, they should not be prompted again the next day about it.

When I first started using it, it would count my steps and deduct the amount of calories my steps accrued. It just simply stopped doing that. I have read EVERY instruction they have to offer. I have emailed them as well. It also says it is reading it from my phone.

All you have to do is type in a food and it will take down all of the food‚Äôs nutrition facts itself and you can look at where your macros are at throughout the day.

You could print the reports, etc. Even the newsfeed was better before. And now I get notifications 2 hours after logging my food that I haven‚Äôt logged my food yet. "

I‚Äôve been doing that for about three months, but still need to manage my food and nutrition.  The programs I looked at didn‚Äôt appeal to me, but this app was perfect!

There have been bugs when syncing the app with the Fitbit tracker that render it useless until they resolve, which usually takes days. I find that nearly every time I scan a barcode to log food or create a recipe, the information is inaccurate. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because MyFitnessPal doesn‚Äôt know how to enter the information or because they allow users to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù nutritional facts and most people are stupid. You‚Äôll want to review each entry carefully before saving. If MyFitnessPal could clean up their nutritional database and permanently resolve the syncing issues with Fitbit, it would move my rating to a five star."

Most times I cook and eat without thinking about how many ingredients there are, or how many crackers are in a serving.

Not to mention it‚Äôs been making my phone heat up on the back when it‚Äôs in use when this app has never made my phone do that before.

Sometimes it subtracts calories based on steps/exercise sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, even though I burned over 1500 calories or more.  It shows the amount of steps but not the adjustment. If I have the app running too long my phone gets too warm.  If these problems were fixed I would 5-Star it. I will probably never upgrade to premium either so it is annoying to see that asked everywhere. I think the price for premium is a ripoff. Just saying."

432,Rebeccakcoco,"May 27, 2018",5,"Just wonderful. I think the advantages of MyFitnessPal compared to other weight loss apps are the user-friendly nature of the design and the size of the database - the barcode scanner is one of its best features. It really helps make the process of tracking your food less monotonous. While I don‚Äôt read the articles very often, the ones I have read seem like they would be very helpful for someone who is new to weight loss or calorie-counting.

436,Chelsea McAnulty,"October 24, 2018",4,I used MFP every day! The app itself is great. I have yet to not find an item when scanned by the barcode. It‚Äôs great to see everything in a single column as well as have the tracker for macros up top. The only thing that makes me give this app 4 stars is the lack of the ability to track NET carbs. It‚Äôs a huge pain to have to go through each meal at the end of the day and calculate what I‚Äôve really had. Especially on a day when I may have a Quest bar or something else really high in carbs but also high in fiber or sugar alcohols. I really figured by now MFP would have this as a standard option in the app.

I love this app and it helped me my entire pregnancy and now will help me lose the minimal weight I did gain.

I love how if I‚Äôm wanting to be bad I can look up how many calories are in what I want and it will keep me from eating it because i see it‚Äôs not in the amount of calories I have left for the day.

This app is fantastic for that, and I‚Äôve been pleased with the free version of it. It‚Äôs been a nice, comparable app to the weight watchers. The reason for 3 stars is because it CONSTANTLY CRASHES. Every single time I open the app, I have to restart it after entering one item in the diary. If it didn‚Äôt crash constantly, and counted the accurate number of calories I burn during workouts, it would be a solid 5. I hope they improve both of these things üôè.

Then I got an Apple Watch mostly so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to carry my phone when working out. I use the My Fitness Pal app from the Apple Watch. Immediately had problems with synching the app from the watch to Map My Fitness which creates a problem synching Map My to My Fitness.

You also don‚Äôt lose your days logged if you can‚Äôt log a day (like if you‚Äôre camping). Their premium also costs less, but you pay for some of the things that MFP has for free in their basic that I enjoy and use. Also, MFP connects better to my tracker than they do.

Also, many of the foods have incorrect nutritional information so one has to pay special attention when entering food.

My Fitness Pal knew, and now I can see how each tiny treat adds up to those weight gains we are prone to as we get older.

472,Jesse J. Gardner,"March 2, 2018",5,"Great app I am new to MyFitnessPal and have started using it after witnessing my teen daughter losing 45 lbs in less than a year. She changed her eating habits and even cooks for herself even though she is a high school junior living at home. The program has taught her to understand the content of food, not just their calories. It has helped her embrace a healthier lifestyle, and she feels more confident about herself. I am enjoying the challenge of losing weight and being more conscious of the foods I eat. I would highly recommend this app/program to anyone."

474,Tookie64!,"June 2, 2019",5,Happy to be a member! I joined Jenny Craig for one month to try to start losing weight. I went into that program weighing 194.6 lbs. I went down to 186.6 lbs. I just ended the program this past weekend and decided that I have enough knowledge on how to eat more healthy and properly. I found MyFitnessPal on my app and decided to join. I just did my weekly weigh in and I‚Äôm now at 181 lbs. This app is wonderful because when I track my daily consumption of food for the day. It informs me on what I‚Äôm doing right and where I have to improve. I love this program!

So I gave My Fitness App a try.  If you are honest with recording what you eat and drink, and your activity, it works!  I‚Äôm very relieved that getting chunkier is not a foregone conclusion. But you do need the discipline to stick with it. So many ways to get blown off course. At least now I have a method that I know works.  And I really ate quite a bit, I made much better choices, esp about portion sizes."

I understand they need to compete and make a profit but I would appreciate more subtle or different types of advertising vs full screen pop ups.

Now who knows who has that information and if they‚Äôre watching my internet usage then they could easily have loads of my personal information. Absolutely ridiculous.

They asked how he did it and he mentioned using the app. Since August 2018 I've lost 40 pounds by just logging everything I eat and exercising regularly. I can say that you'll never realize how much you eat until you actually log it in the app. Now the app is a regular part of my life so I didn't just lose weight but I changed my lifestyle. My blood pressure is down, my BMI is down and I feel great."

483,Chinapaige,"January 4, 2019",1,"Frustrated. Could be so much better. I have never really enjoyed using this app, but it was at least functional and had a large database of food, even though those are user supplied. Now when I re-downloaded the app onto my iPad I was apparently signed up for the premium features, even though I have been a member on the site for the past 3 years and never elected to sign up for it. I was charged for an entire year of subscription and neither iTunes or myfitnesspal will refund it. So I tried getting some use out of the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù features, but I‚Äôm experiencing bugs, links that go around in circles and issues connecting to my Fitbit. Too simplistic and the UI is still wonky and the look as unattractive as it was when I signed up in 2016."

You can import recipes, and it will calculate the nutritional value of a serving. Scanning food package UPC‚Äôs has never failed me. It brings up the nutritional content of processed foods. In addition, I really like the healthy food recipes that pop up on the blog. I send those to the Pocket app for reference. The font on this app is a little small, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt respond to my touch on the interface. I know this is not related to my phone, I think it‚Äôs the speed of the app instead."
485,Rockporters,"March 12, 2019",3,"Okay, but much of the nutritional info is incorrect. The app works well with many devices and services. It is easy enough to use. However, the food catalog is a crazy mess. There are many inaccurate food items. You have to Google ‚Äúlarge egg‚Äù because only one or two of the umpteen entries have correct nutritional values. Researching every food item is really obnoxious, and it eliminates the usefulness of this app. It would be great if basic food items were easy to find AND nutritionally correct. Sure, allow customization for non-basic items, but it would be so much better if some entries were just easy.(and correct!)"

A year ago I noticed when I logged an exercise activity through the apple activity app to MFP it would wipe out the step count for that day. After monitoring further, any exercise blocks all steps for that day and will remove all step not counted in a specific exercise thus I have lost 100‚Äôs of miles of steps over 3 years. I year ago i open a ticket with UA, followed up very 3 months. Never addressed, not time frame to fix it and ‚Äúit‚Äôs harder to fix than they expected‚Äù.

The purchase $50/year is nothing in compare to the life change! I am saving money on food, I dont eat out, I prepare my food for the whole week and log in food every day to stay on track.

Now I‚Äôm searching for something else. Ads are completely understandable but they are now literally placed in the middle of every useful screen in the app. So much screen real estate lost and they now use shady UX design to try and trick you into clicking an ad.

I thought connecting my Fit Bit would help but it doesn‚Äôt even work. I have contacted help twice and they responded saying they have had so many complaints that they can‚Äôt get to everyone. Good concept but bad execution. They need to go back to what it used to be when it actually worked.

The only thing I noticed is when we scroll through the food diary for the day, the bar that says ‚Äúcalories, carbs, fat, protein, sodium and sugars‚Äù disappears.  Sometimes I can‚Äôt remember which column is which when I am looking at the meals below it.  Perhaps that could be changed?"
498,Veronica ***,"June 4, 2019",3,Good but has FITBIT issues Good app for tracking calories. It‚Äôs surprising how many different brands of foods it recognizes. A big problem for me is that the app constantly has issues with syncing with my Fitbit. It says it‚Äôs connected but it doesn‚Äôt incorporate steps and calories burned. It happens at least once a week. And it‚Äôs so annoying to have to disconnect all the apps and wait. Sometimes that works and sometimes that doesn‚Äôt. Wish they‚Äôd figure out the issue. There‚Äôs a whole trouble shooting section on their website which means it‚Äôs been happening for a long time but for some reason they haven‚Äôt found a solution yet.

The app is so easy to use and I use the scan option frequently but most the food items are found under the options.  It also tracks your exercise and the calories burned!

I can‚Äôt even track the time I ate the food without subscribing. From the moment I opened the app I‚Äôm inundated with repeated reminders that all the useful stuff is a premium feature. It‚Äôs fine to have to pay for some stuff, but locking away 99% of tracking features is just bad. The app design is horrible and very unintuitive.

I was logging my food and I got a low calorie reading for the item I was logging. So I checked several other apps that I subscribe to and they had different calorie readings also. So I decided to look the food item up on the website and it was higher than what MFP said in their database.  I know that apps claim that some foods might be slightly off but when the food is off by 10 or more calories...that‚Äôs a big difference when you‚Äôre serious about counting calories. If this can‚Äôt be fixed I might have to jump ship.

Now I feel like it‚Äôs hard for me to quantify how I did in a week since I would have to go back through every day and do the math myself.  I can do it, but it was way more convenient before.

This breaks down various nutrients in each food item you partake in.  It is incredible because it also provides a running total of each nutrient.  This is invaluable due to my need to keep a close eye on my sugar intake.  If I kept going about all the fantastic aspects of this app, I would end up writing a 1,000 page review.

No way in hell are the upgrades so great that I‚Äôm spending $100 a year. Let me repeat that. The premium upgrades seem very flashy but honestly there are just a few that are helpful.  I‚Äôll go back to the free version. You almost had my $50 a year. Greedy market strategy. The EA of health apps. Some of us have families that live healthy lifestyles.
524,The Spitch Titcher,"February 23, 2019",5,Unhappy with update MyFitnessPal used to show me me my macros for each food and meals in the food diary so I could track which macros I might need more or less of when meal planning.  Now I just have how many calories are left at the top on that page and the pie cart on the home page.  I want to see my macros again in the food diary without opening up each food and keeping track on a piece of paper.  Booo!  Don‚Äôt like this update.  This now gets one star..but the old one would get all the stars.
525,betty9131,"April 9, 2020",4,"Needs a couple of tweaks While this is a great app in so many ways, I‚Äôd like to offer a couple of suggestions.  The hardest problem I have with this app is figuring out the calories in dishes I make.  The recipe calorie function is difficult to use and putting in the number of servings is something I constantly have to spend a lot of time figuring how to work it.  The other thing would be to have more information on adding in the exercise portion.  Maybe I am just missing it (that wouldn‚Äôt be a first),  but I would like to be more efficient with this."
526,Lexivh,"February 29, 2020",5,"Love it, but needs one more thing I love this tracking app.  I have been eating keto for quite some time and love how many recipes and items there are already in here.  The only criticism that I have is that it doesn‚Äôt track net carbs.  I know the math is really easy, I just don‚Äôt like the orange/red message that pops up when I input something that puts me over my total carbs, even while I am well within my net carb goal. It may seem silly, but it‚Äôs like a psychological reprimand.  Other than that detail this app is great"
527,Rednluscious,"January 12, 2020",5,"Keto Diet/Fitness PAL I‚Äôve always done the easy method with losing weight, diet pills, well now with being a newlywed and having a husband that LOVES to EAT, the pills stopped working...I have been on Keto for 7 days today and I feel fantastic! With the help of Fitness Pal I can log everything in (loving the scan barcode thingy) and make sure I don‚Äôt go over my calories, carbs, 0 sugar, just all of it is AMAZING!!! Thanks to my husband for the iPhone 11 Pro, it helps to gauge my steps and exercise. Hopefully I can get to my goal weight 140, he‚Äôll I‚Äôll settle for 149üòÇü§£üòÇ"
528,GDefenbaugh,"January 3, 2020",2,A bit cumbersome to use I needed a calorie counting app to help me quit snacking and lose about 20 lbs. Couldn‚Äôt decide between this app and LoseIt so I used them both for a month. Entered everything in both places. 
529,Awesome96,"December 8, 2019",5,"I keep coming back to this app I‚Äôve tried other apps, but myfitnesspal seems to have the most extensive suggestions for food from restaurants or homemade. I love their layout, it‚Äôs organized by meal and by macronutrients. There is the social aspect also, which means my family can all get involved despite living in different cities. The only qualm is I wish there were more comprehensive micronutrients and minerals that could be tracked, but even with this flaw I still choose it over others meal trackers."
530,Pastor Trainer,"September 10, 2017",4,"Great app...but I have been enjoying this app very much as it helps me to stay focused pursuing my goals. But I travel a lot during the year and especially out of the country, even to places where there is no internet connection, like Cuba. The app doesn't work when there is no internet access and that limits my ability to keep up with my progress. You need to include the possibility to log in the foods of each meal"
531,4tomove,"October 20, 2017",4,Positive motivation I really like this app because it helps me to stay on tract with the goals I have set for myself. 
532,Autumchelsea,"November 29, 2017",5,"Love the scan feature!! There are so many options when you look for one food. Ex.- if I looked for carrots, the option would be: sauteed, raw, steam, carrots and broccoli and the list goes on. Not only does the app give you many options per food, it also has many brands the carrots might be (great value, trader Joe's). Lastly and my absolute favorite feature is if the scanner. If you can't find your brand on the list, just scan the barcode on the item and the scanner picks up instantly. I love it so much!"
533,Almqvistersoll,"December 14, 2017",4,"Mostly super helpful Overall this app is really great for tracking calories, and keeping yourself accountable. The only two things I wish this app provided (and keep in mind I do not have Premium) is: 1) more options in entering exercise, like group workouts, or cardio/strength combination exercises. Right now I don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôm burning if I am doing a core strength class for example; 2) it would be cool to have a place to put in body measurements in addition to what you do, so one could track how many inches lost off of their waist for example. Other than that, super great app."
534,DankUserName123,"January 9, 2018",3,"Functional app, but takes a while to use At least with the free version, there are no presets for common foods, so you have to manually enter all the nutrition info for a food, and when you scroll down too far, you can lose some nutrient info you just entered. To my knowledge, there‚Äôs no way to update a food once you create it, so you have to delete it and try again. While it has a few minor functional problems, still a good app for tracking diet and exercise, and has a news feed for recipe and workout ideas. Would recommend for anyone trying a new fitness or workout program."
535,DCBoyWonder,"March 28, 2018",2,"Used to be a 5 Star App! Please fix the Apple Watch 3 / MFP synching issue. I need this capability and functionality badly!  I used to used MFP religiously...from meal tracking, to the challenges, the community aspect and follow some of the suggested recipes/workouts.  The app was always consistent and I never had any problems"
536,FECS84,"June 12, 2018",5,"Love this App!! Can not believe I haven‚Äôt been using this app, before- it‚Äôs fantastic!! Love how it tracks everything and makes calorie recommendations for your goals. It seriously keeps me on track. Imputing food is SUPER easy- being able to scan in items, even some pretty obscure ones. The recipe feature is awesome- I no longer have to ‚Äòbuild‚Äô recipes- it will import a recipe from any provided link, then you can go in manually and switch up/delete any ingredients for a more accurate count. Game changer!"
537,MikeHofstra,"January 22, 2019",4,Been Using for Years - Still Needs Work I have used this app for around five years now. I enjoy the fact that it syncs the data to HealthKit. I wish it would sync water consumption data with HealthKit as well
538,KazP.F.T.,"April 8, 2020",5,"Male Weight reduction plan This program makes tracking calories so easy. As a professional fitness trainer that has trained U.S. Olympic and professional athletes, it‚Äôs a breeze and huge time saver."
539,Lhorn96,"August 16, 2019",5,"Much improved over the version I was using 2 years ago I love this latest version (Aug 2019). It is so easy to make entries in my food diary and I love the feedback at the end of the day indicating how quickly I could lose weight if I kept up today‚Äôs pattern of diet and exercise. The database is fantastic‚Äîit even had an entry for an obscure snack item I had bought at an Indian grocery store. I can tell this app is going to be very useful in my journey to lose a few pounds and bring my blood sugar levels down,"
540,Topsailbeach,"September 27, 2017",3,"Useful but now an ad-fest, really too bad ‚òπÔ∏è Update: Another great app made worse by corporate ads. Now popup ads & ads in your food diary, very intrusive.  Ads in the other pages aren't so bad but having them in the food diary is really annoying."
541,Phigir,"October 16, 2017",4,"Move nutrition button to top of page I like this app, but wish the nutrition button would be at the top of the screen, rather than having to scroll each time to the bottom of the page. Also, when scrolling from day to day to check foods eaten, breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks, keep the page at the same designation rather that auto scrolling to the top. If I want to compare dinners, it's a pain to have to change the date, then scroll down to dinner, rather than have the page just change to the dinner location."
542,sallsk,"October 17, 2017",4,Enjoy a lot I like that it uses information from my Apple Watch and Fitbit to give me an accurate exercise calorie count. Also I like that it gives you the option how many pounds to loose I week and give you motivation at the end of the day saying if you eat like this in 5 weeks you will weight this many pounds. What I don‚Äôt like about it and maybe I just can‚Äôt figure it out but when I input my recipes I can‚Äôt figure out how to see the ingredients I used or edit after I save it so if I forgot an ingredient I have to re-enter the entire recipe over
543,Hughey13,"February 11, 2020",3,"Beware of the ‚Äúfree‚Äù trail. I have been using this app for a long time now but recently have been interested in giving the premium portion of the app a try. I finally decided I would utilize the 1-month free trial option before committing. When following the process of activating the free trial, I was charged for the monthly subscription right away. And lost my opportunity for the free 1 month trial. The app stated I would be charged either the monthly or annual amount AFTER the free trial was over. Unfortunately this is not the case and will be disputing. I will continue to use this app but will never give my mom to them again for ‚Äúpremium‚Äù"
544,Big Red 24/7,"January 7, 2020",5,Friend Indeed I am not one that falls short when it comes to task oriented situations. I‚Äôm pretty organized and I follow through . Until it comes to my own personal life . I have the tendency to disregard myself and put me last in most things. And most of the time last doesn‚Äôt ever happen! 
545,allthnamesaretaken567@,"November 5, 2019",3,"Great concept, Buggy and slow reality The concept of mfp is amazing and so helpful. I‚Äôve been using it for years. After my last pregnancy I got the app again and this time around it‚Äôs frustratingly slow and buggy to use. The desktop site works fine though. I would never consider going premium when the free version is barely functional. If mfp ever went full premium I would find another service, even if I had to pay for the alternative. If they ever figure out how to speed the app back up I think they will find many more premium customers...but it‚Äôs been months of this for me."
546,nikineurosis,"September 15, 2019",4,Almost 5 stars because.. Because I use this app strictly to monitor what I eat for my carb intake and sugar intake. I have pre diabetes and am trying to reverse it. I have multiple apps on my phone for my sugar and this is the only app for my food. It would be WONDERFUL if this app would connect to the sugar tracking apps like mySugr or one drop or others. From what I understand mySugr is the most popular? But in it you have to track your carb intake. If the two apps could collaborate and track the carbs together and the calorie intake and other stuff together that would be Amazing!
547,quickly1111,"August 26, 2019",5,Helping me be aware A colleague of mine at work suggested I use this app and I‚Äôm loving it. That all he is is helping me keep on track and starting to lose weight but it also informs me about the nutrients and eating and how much fat and sugar is actually in food. I haven‚Äôt tried it the premium subscription am on the free one for now. It‚Äôs so easy to use and it lets you repeat common meals that you eat like I usually eat the same breakfast every morning so it‚Äôs easy to copy it and not have to re-enter the whole thing.
548,Frustrated Chef 222,"July 14, 2019",1,"Never ‚ÄúUp to date‚Äù No matter what iOS it is, this app never seems to work correctly. I kept thinking that it was because Apple updated the iOS and the app hadn‚Äôt been updated yet, but every time I update to the current iOS, My Fitness Pal crashes. They put out an update. It still crashes, and sometimes more frequently, or (in the case of the current app version) it never even opens at all. I am tired of trying to use an app that is never available when I need it. I would think Under Armour could spare some of their millions to make the app work correctly, but I guess they spend too much money flying their helicopter between downtown Baltimore and BWI, and they can‚Äôt afford to keep up with the app."
549,UglyDuckling1980,"June 25, 2019",5,Takes the guess work out of being healthy I love this app because it takes the guesswork out of being healthy along with its sister app that tracks your exercise and combines it for calories. The only thing I wish is that there was a spot for supplements. I currently put them under snacks even though most apps have a snack spot between each meal or a bunch at the bottom. I wish there was more than one snack option so I could keep track of when and why I‚Äôm more ironed to snacking.
550,Ana Bananie,"September 12, 2017",4,"Good overall, but something's missing for me. I've been using MyFitnessPal since I was 16 years old, and it's been a go-to. I love that you can connect your chosen fitness tracker to the app (mine is a Misfit Shine) and have all of your information there, simplified. The UI is also very minimal and not too busy. The only thing that is missing for me is one app: Nike+ Training Club. My fitness tracking device only tracks three types of physical activity, and it's an issue because I use NTC a lot! MFP would be the ultimate app if we were able to connect the two. Please consider it!"
551,Wtfallthenamestaken,"February 26, 2018",5,I Love It !! I wasn‚Äôt aware of how much damage I was causing to my body and health by just consuming too many calories per day and not drinking enough water throughout the day. This app has helped tremendously by helping me keep track of what I'm putting in my body and showing me a clear display of the nutritional content in a way that I can easily understand. I‚Äôve been logging every single meal for 30 days straight and I think I might be upgrading to premium pretty soon because it‚Äôs totally worth it !
552,Bc5174919,"March 22, 2018",4,"Expand the age My mother and grandmother use MFP to loose weight, I‚Äôm 13 and according to them I eat too little and need to eat a little more and a bit healthier before it all catches up with me. I went to this app seeking help with keeping track, but you have to be 18 and I can‚Äôt change my age because that would change my calorie limit. I would love if you can expand the age limit and maybe have a different course (just staying healthy and active) for those who are under 18. Other than that it‚Äôs a great app and it‚Äôs working well for my family!"
553,It's kinda enh,"July 28, 2018",5,"Caution I‚Äôm 15 and was once 225lbs. MyFitnessPal has succeeded in helping me lose 86 lbs and counting in less than a year but I want to warn people, especially teens that calorie counting becomes addictive. It‚Äôs s o easy to stem an obsession with logging every single little thing you eat and while it does work to lose weight and potentially become physically healthier, it‚Äôs not mentally healthy to become a slave to it. I will say though, that out of all the calorie counting apps MyFitnessPal is the easiest to use without a membership. Make good choices:)"
554,C*line,"November 5, 2018",5,"I lost more weight than I thought I could! This app has been instrumental in losing first the nagging five pounds then since hat was easy, I went for 10 and got there. Then I was so close to my college weight I figured why not give it a shot. And it worked! LOTs of food items in the food diary and I started measuring food so I could enter it. It opened my eyes to portion size. It‚Äôs been 4 months that I‚Äôve kept it off (still entering food to the app to make sure I maintain). I hope to make it through the winter!"
555,Bad on service,"February 25, 2019",4,Love the app BUT I love this app and how easy it is to log foods. What I realize and the only thing I don‚Äôt like is how it adds the calories I‚Äôve burned in a workout to how many calories I have left to consume for the day. I feel like I‚Äôm not getting anywhere with my weight if it‚Äôs telling me to eat 1500 calories but at the end of the day I see I consumed 1700. Why make a calorie budget if you‚Äôre just gonna go over without even realizing your doing it because it add the calories that you burn to what you have left to consume. 
556,tjaysithkb,"March 21, 2019",2,Umm I like the app to a point.  This app says it will sync with Fitbit but it does not work right.  I have it setup to Count my steps This app states I walked 377 steps and burned -37 calories.  So out of my 2000 calories a day it now says I only have 1963 calories left.  Umm math is not right. It should have not been -37 off my calories per day but added 2037    Do not blame Fitbit. Fitbit has the numbers right. Another bug there are times that this add will not even add steps walked calories but has the steps walked.  I have use a different step app and it does the same.  I have also checked to make sure that all the app can talk to each other so my settings are good.  Definitely a bug in the program.
557,Slink McDink,"April 9, 2019",2,"Great in Theory, GARBAGE Execution The app is great, and really the only legitimate option for calorie/macro tracking. However, the bugs are consistent in every single update, some of which are more than minor annoyances. With the most recent update, the app is freezing on my 6s just about every single time I add a food to the log (and it isn‚Äôt just me). It‚Äôs completely unacceptable given this app‚Äôs track record, and quite frankly, something that even highschool-aged programmers could fix. Couple that with the abysmal battery life draining, and it‚Äôs almost more worth your time to just track your macros by hand with some pen and paper."
558,Mek289,"January 15, 2020",3,"Room for improvement Interface is not nearly as user friendly as the LoseIt app. The premise of the app is good but it‚Äôs frustrating to use. The free version only gives you access to half the screen while scrolling in diary mode. App is glitchy and freezes a lot. Any time you leave the diary page and come back, it scrolls all the way back up to the top, and you have to scroll down again. I‚Äôm constantly scrolling in this app. Can‚Äôt see macros on the main diary page. App defaults to home tab but diary tab is the most frequently used. It could be so much easier to use than it is"
559,planetkween,"November 18, 2019",5,"Most Helpful Fitness Tracker This app is seriously amazing. I was looking for a simple calorie tracker to help me slim down before the Holidays when I found this app through Reddit. It is so simple to use! To start you type in your height, age range, current weight, and your goal.  I recommend the ‚Äúone pound a week‚Äù loss rate. There is also a barcode scanning option to log food, which has been so helpful. I started on November 3rd and I am already one pound away from my goal! *My goal was to lose 5 pounds*"

I do work out with a trainer once a week and she suggested that I keep a food journal so I can reach my nutritional goals.  I began keeping track online, which was very slow going.  My trainer recommended doing the same thing on my IPhone.  It was a lot easier!  I have lost 6 lbs, but now am fluctuating.  I am determined to lose about 5 more lbs, by making tweaks to my diet.  My Fitness Pal has been helpful to me with my calorie count and food portions.   Thank you for this app."
561,SpockWB,"March 12, 2019",5,Lost 15 lbs using this I never ever wanted to be a calorie counter. But this app made it so easy that it‚Äôs just become part of my life. Setting up meals makes it easy since I usually eat the same 10-12 meals during the week. A few clicks and it‚Äôs in. I discovered I was eating about 200 cal too much a day. Cut back on a few things and in the last 8 months I‚Äôve lost 15 lbs. can‚Äôt believe it. Even when I don‚Äôt work out a calorie deficit is all it takes and this app makes the math easy.
562,Far Away Native,"May 3, 2019",4,"Great App, could easily be better! This is a very useful app and has done wonders for me.  However, it has one frustrating flaw!  There is no easy way to delete foods out of your food diary.  If you make the mistake of logging one food from a specific restaurant that you may never eat again, it‚Äôs in your food diary forever.  The food diary gets so clogged up, it‚Äôs frustrating to find the foods you have eaten before and eat occasionally.  A simple swipe to reveal a delete button seems to be such a simple solution to this major problem!"

I‚Äôve lost about 35 lbs total and I‚Äôm back using it to lose 20 more lbs. helps you take accountability for what you are putting into your body. Now that I‚Äôm focused on actual nutrition vs calories, it is a great tool helping me see what to eat more of and what‚Äôs just not worth it. Get this app. You will love it.

Foods with only tangential relevance to what I was looking for started filling up the first, second, third, etc. search result screens.

I also love the fact that I can import recipes from the Internet or type them in myself and the app figures out all of the nutritional information for me. This app has been a lifesaver. The creators deserve a standing ovation for this one! Thank you so much!"

I turned to MFP out of desperation at my inability to plan and stick to a healthy eating plan in order to shed stuck-on baby weight that was lingering on long after my kids were babies anymore. I cannot believe the amount of calories I must've consumed on a daily basis before using MFP. I lost 3 lbs in the first 10 days simply by being held accountable for my food intake. Wow. I'm still on my 40-50 lb weight loss journey and I don't know if I could have realistically done this without this amazing and helpful app!

This is a problem that I‚Äôve had previously on occasion, but especially after the last update. I‚Äôve had this problem through different phones as well, so it is 100% the app itself.

It counts the all the same, whether it is a candy bar or fiber carbs from vegetables.  My physician supervised diet wants me to eat 800 to 1000 calories per day, mainly proteins and carbs from vegetables only. The app will not post to my timeline because it says I am not eating enough.  There goes the whole social aspect.  I will probably look for another app."
575,migraine sleuth,"January 14, 2018",5,Lisad Easy to use. Can do a little or a lot depending on what you want or have time to do.  I particularly like the running count of how many days I‚Äôve logged in. It makes me want to keep the streak going. I also like when you complete diary at the end of the day. It shows you how much you would weigh in five weeks if you ate that amount every day. Sometimes faster sometimes slower but it‚Äôs not all or nothing. I bought a new scale and weigh myself once a week and so far so good. Excellent app.
576,Tara-Liz,"January 15, 2018",5,"Love it! This app has been so helpful with keeping up with all my nutrition stats. I have three kids and every day is busy so my memory isn't what it used to be. As long as I log all my food and drinks when I have them into the app it keeps up with it for me. I can go back throughout the day and check my intake for calories, protein, carbs, etc. as many times as I need to. It helps you set goals and gives reminders about them. It has great recipes. It has awesome exercise regimes. Love this app!"

Very grateful for this app. It would be great if the developers added more micronutrient categories (e.g. magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, K, selenium, omega 3 to 6 ratio, etc.) I realize this is nitpicking and most nutrition labels unfortunately don‚Äôt disclose this information specific to the manufacturer (which they should legally have to IMO). It would be nice to have a general idea of intake based on the food type and information that is readily available. It would be a great addition to an already great app!"

Advertisements do pop up, but hey; it is a free app. My only ding is that the premium level has an incredibly complex agreement that scared me away. Also, the cost is not provided up front. Seems you have to agree before you learn the price(?)"

I paid for the premium account. I had a free account and $50 account. They told me that my $50 premium paid account did not exist. Two weeks later with ongoing complaint to the Better Business Bureau they give me access to my free account to change the password. Still not giving me access to my completely full paid premium account that in their records does not exist but my iTunes records proof with the email record and my paid receipt that I do have an account that is premium. Never use this app I will get my money back these people are ripped off agents.

583,docbart,"February 23, 2019",5,Very impressive app Really really well thought out. Ideal for calorie counting and exercisers. The database is incredibly complete. Many small points were beautifully thought through such as the ability to change potion size and quantities (fractions or decimals). Have tried many diets. They all work to some degree for short term loss but then one returns to previous habits and all is lost. If one continues to track eating then one can maintain the loss. This really helps. The monthly cost is worth it. Kudos to you!
584,Starsigma,"March 22, 2019",3,"Great app but is missing a few things I have used this app for years. Recently it has been logging me out randomly for no reason. However it doesn‚Äôt crash like some apps do. Has been working great to keep track of daily nutrition, except for the fact it lacks the basic function to keep track of your vitamin D levels. To be a nutrition/health app it really shouldn‚Äôt be picking and choosing what items is going to recognize and keep track of. It really needs to do everything across-the-board as far as your intake when it comes to your vitamins, minerals, and food intake, etc."

This is a common ‚Äúrun around‚Äù tactic used to prevent customers from getting a refund for a service you don‚Äôt use. Do not use Myfitnesspal. I then sent them my credit card statement showing the 4 monthly charges, the bill was for $9.99 and it clearly said ‚ÄúMYFITNESSPAL‚Äù, still not refund. They told me to refer to the terms and conditions and that if I could not show proof that I was charged in itunes, that they could not help me.

For me counting every calorie I put in my mouth is the only serious way to lose weight. Having said that in the end only you can ultimately be responsible for checking calories and serving sizes. I generally believe that if you want to lose weight you should shoot to leave daily calories on the table - especially those attributed to exercise. I am finding that the calorie read on this app is a bit high and I need to gear it to a lower calorie count to lose.

Specifically yesterday, it seemed like no one could log in all day based on reviews. Unfortunately that threw off my entire day yesterday.

Come on guys please fix this!! All my journey is in that app!! Every time there is an update I‚Äôm excited to see if it‚Äôs finally fixed?!! But nothing has resolved this issue yet.

It took 1 year to lose 40 pounds and over the next 3 years I‚Äôve lost 10 more. I plan on doing this good habit until my days end-which I think I may be extending by the very use of this simple and effective tool. It‚Äôs keeps you accountable to yourself in a positive way.

Manually going in and retroactively subtracting my fiber from my carb intake to see where I‚Äôm at is kind of a hassle and seems like something that could be done and displayed by the app in real time.

We are animals and not exempt to the animal kingdom. Live in the world not in La la land. Get educated on both side of the line and find what‚Äôs best for you. Don‚Äôt be fooled by someone else spouting off rhetoric from someone they trusted who they thought they knew what they were doing but really, they didn‚Äôt.

It helps me track my carb intake and help me stay at a certain amount of calories per day. I used this app in conjunction with diet and exercise.

Using this app makes a person aware of calorie intake and it really is easy to change the type of food intake to cut calories.  No hunger.  In two months I have been able to cut my long acting insulin injection from 110 units to 30 units per day.  I anticipate getting to a goal of ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rather than ‚Äúobese‚Äù and at that goal I expect I will be able to eliminate injectable insulin completely!  Maybe someday I will be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù!

This is why I decided to purchase the premium Fitness Pal membership! But trying to record food in the food diary is so complicated, there is so much going on the page, it is confusing to find your way around the app because nothing is clearly marked.

If it was somehow electronically connected to my body I think it would give me a jolt of electricity when I don‚Äôt eat the correct foods or eat to much.

Also, many & I mean many of the barcode‚Äôs info that I scan does does match the nutrition facts on the packages. I have to double check everything I scan because it can‚Äôt be trusted.

I‚Äôm almost positive it is about my age because I don‚Äôt think gender/living in the USA would affect getting accepted, which is what else was on the screen.

Check the website and lo and behild it synced to the server just isnt available on the app.  FAQ search tells me to try reinstalling, which works but I niw have to do that every time I create or adjust a recipe.

695,Lady Chatterbox,"May 3, 2019",5,All I need To Lose Weight Safely It was such a joy to find a weight loss program that is so effective and easy to follow. It‚Äôs everything that you will need to cut weight and it counts all the calories and nutrients and exercises needed for you each day. I‚Äôm a senior citizen and have been on several weight loss plans and they all work as long as you stay on them but not all of them are as effective as Fitness Plus is. You won‚Äôt be disappointed so try it!
696,Mike K from A2,"May 3, 2019",3,"Pros & Cons of MyFitnessPal app For the most part, the MFP app is good.  However, I do wish on some level the Exercise Diary portion was better.  On the Strength Portion of the app, it needs at least a basic amount of weights automatically added in order to gage how many calories burned in general.  I understand that there are more variables to work with each type of strength & conditioning exercise, but surely there‚Äôs got to be something to use.  It‚Äôs a lot of looking up each item or trying to figure out on my Apple iWatch for each exercise.  If that could be amended, that would be terrific."
697,ItsAllBobbins,"August 23, 2019",1,"Very important detail still overlooked As an app developer and UI designer myself, I can‚Äôt believe the developers still have not moved the six ‚Äúfood diary‚Äù column headings onto the ‚Äústicky header‚Äù so they remain visible when you scroll down the page. Calories, carbs, fat, protein, sodium sugars, these six column headings disappear as you scroll, so you have to keep going back to the top to remember which column you‚Äôre looking at. Incredibly cumbersome. It would actually be really easy to make them part of the sticky header... somebody needs to pay attention to user experience and user interface."

You eat while you keep track of your calories and fat, sugar, sodium intake, etc.   This app helps you choose food wisely so you can eat three meals and still lose weight! And a huge plus for me... BIG help with menopause hot flashes. It‚Äôs like night and day, before using this app and after. I think watching my sugar limit has made a striking difference. I feel like myself again. I LOVE THIS APP!"

Seeing your hard work on a graph, in a pie chart, explained thoroughly, ingredient by ingredient is so helpful. It keeps you accountable, and gives you something productive to do instead of eating more food, track it instead. Go for a walk to add steps. Go exercise so you can post it online. Seriously, make this app a new hobby. Everyone is using it, and for good reason. (:"

Entering my own recipes, tracking my weight since day one, etc. I‚Äôve never tried the paid version because I think it‚Äôs too expensive. I would up my rating another star if there weren‚Äôt a million adds to go through. You should be able to delete them as you go if we‚Äôre forced to have them without paying the extra."

I‚Äôll be in WiFi or LTE, connected to the internet, and the app says I‚Äôm in offline mode and won‚Äôt load anything. Turning WiFi on or off doesn‚Äôt change it, and if I restart the app it will do it again. It‚Äôs just annoying because I can‚Äôt search for foods in that mode.

I have tried to uninstall the app, and sign in multiple times. The one thing that got me past the birthdate part of the signup was to change the birthday from the example that they had.

709,shevevbehevevhe,"April 10, 2020",5,Love it ! I love this app so much. I‚Äôve been trying to gain weight and this app helped me realize how much I was under-eating. It helps to track my calories throughout the day and it‚Äôs very easy to use. It also shows some home-workouts to try. My favorite part of the app is when i ‚Äúcomplete my diary‚Äù for the day and it tells me how much I‚Äôll weigh in 5 weeks if I continue to eat so and so many calories. I‚Äôve recommended this app to so many of my friends!
710,Squidbugpizzanator123,"October 3, 2018",5,"Great app but be careful. A life controlled by numbers is not a life at all. The day I deleted this app changed my life for the better. The app itself does an amazing job but if you are mentally weak or have past experience with eating disorders I would not recommend it. The numbers haunted me and if I could change one thing, I would say that the main goal should be what is going in to your body rather than what amount of calories you‚Äôre consuming."
711,megannnc12,"November 5, 2018",1,Terrible If I could give this app 0 stars I would. First time I downloaded it it gave me a certain amount of calories I could eat and then I had ended up deleting the app and re downloading again and the 2nd time with all of the same information it gave me about 300 less calories to work with. I did this a couple times to see if it would keep giving me a different number and it did. Another thing is it doesn‚Äôt even tell you how many calories you burned on strength training only cardio. NOW it randomly logged me out and I can‚Äôt get back into it. I have reset my password & restarted the whole app and still can‚Äôt get in. Do not waste your time with this
712,micro-farm,"November 8, 2018",1,"My Fitness Pal Have used their premium application for over two years. No problems until the last two weeks. At that time the application would not access the silver for updated nutritional values and meal login entry.   Once restored it work for a couple of days and then all history of meals recorded disappeared, all previously used food sources are now missing and all previously saved combination meals have also gone missing. Repeated requests for assistance we‚Äôre not answered or to submit a request, their spam prevention tool would not function reasonably. I‚Äôve started shopping for another application to meet my needs. A petty because that used to work wonderfully."
713,JaysonnP789,"December 2, 2018",5,"Good app some problems Overall, the app is amazing. I can track my steps and my calorie intake and many other things. The one problem I am having is finding the food I eat. I usually just scan the barcode from the things I eat but sometimes I don‚Äôt have the barcode and when I try to search the food it says ‚Äúno results found‚Äù. And I have to go to different websites to find out the nutrition facts from the items I eat."
714,rose of,"March 12, 2019",5,Breakthrough Tool for Navigating Diet and Exercise in Your 50s I just started using this app about a month ago and am thrilled with what I am learning by using it. I have found the macro calculating feature to be incredibly helpful and mtivating in helping me make wiser nutrition choices. My exercise and diet are truly working together well now. It‚Äôs been a real breakthrough. Thank you for developing this technology. I look forward to using even more features in the future.
715,Nikki Nikk28,"November 2, 2019",5,"So rewarding I shocked to know that I could take advantage of the basic features without being swindled into some kind of monthly subscription (which I plan to do eventually). Being a new vegan is not the easiest task. I was not losing weight and could not figure out why until I downloaded this app. My weight no longer yo-yos. So far, I have lost 6 pounds in 6 days. I only have 15 more to go and I‚Äôm confident I will reach my goal with the organized guidance of the app."
716,38wwrdccma,"September 25, 2019",4,"Missing some essential features There should really be a way to modify the serving size (or fraction of) you‚Äôve had of a food item or meal to accurately track you food intake, etc. Also, when quick adding something apple watch, there‚Äôs no way to record the time without opening the phone app. It could at least log it with the current time automatically. Also.. not connecting with apple healthkit! It would be nice to see more fitness app options to connect to."

But lately, (suddenly starting mid last week) it‚Äôs no longer capturing my exercise activity from the Apple Health App. I‚Äôve double checked, everything is connected as should be. Even deleted and re-downloaded the app. Still nada. "
719,theonenandonly,"June 14, 2019",5,Amazing The user interface of the app is easy to navigate and use. It is also beneficial in a way that you can still keep track of many aspects of your diet without buying any sort of subscription or premium offer. I have been using this for a week now and it has helped tremendously in my goal of gaining weight. 5/5 would recommend you check this app out if you are looking for a simple food tracker.
720,JacKaL_37,"December 16, 2017",5,"Excellent app for nutritional self-education It's easy to get started, and the fact that it's always with you means it's easy to stick with it. By removing the guesswork and instead just TELLING YOU the nutrients, calories, and other content of the food you eat, it turns dieting on its head-- I learn every day instead of panicking about not knowing enough."
721,Zodiak67,"December 31, 2017",3,Not stable at times Not sure about the last updates since I  have had nothing but problems with freezing when trying to add day before same meal. Had to shut down and restart to enter food. Set different macros for the week and my diary settings for macronutrient focus flipped to calorie focus. Tried resetting it several times. Wouldn't hold the setting. Made sure I was up to date on software. Still would not lock in macronutrient focus. Had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work. Just seems more and more unstable these days.
722,Badcrispypuff,"January 26, 2018",2,Poor I had used this app in the past and didn‚Äôt quite understand it. I just recently downloaded it again but I‚Äôm not happy. I like it can track our calories in what we eat. that part is amazing. But when it comes down to putting in your work outs. It‚Äôs terrible. Everyone knows planks are a work out for the abs but when I search for it it comes up ‚Äúnot found‚Äù and I do planks everyday. How am I supposed to count my burned calories if this app can‚Äôt even search up a plank. That‚Äôs ridiculous. I will not be recommending this app to anyone. Also I did other work outs to and those wouldn‚Äôt show up either!
723,Nataleah M,"March 5, 2018",5,I love MyFitnessPal! I can not say enough good things about the MyFitnessPal! I‚Äôm the type of person if I don‚Äôt write it down or track it then I didn‚Äôt eat it! This app holds me accountable for what I eat by telling me make better food choices or showing me what meal was the worst and in what ways! This app takes the thinking out of an already hard process! I also love that it is updated to local restaurants near me so picking food choices are super easy now!
724,CAD Programmer,"April 4, 2018",1,"Glitchy And Crashes DAILY!!! Good app for tracking calories, but the app crashes a lot - a LOT, like, at least once per day. It's also very SLOW at initializing (which you get to do at least once a day due the frequent crashing). The latest update has it now reverting back to the Home tab each time the app is activated which is VERY obnoxious. Many of the food units are ridiculous (like, fluid oz/ml for green leaf lettuce - really? Lettuce is a liquid?). Overall it's very glitchy and SLOW, and has a clunky user-interface. This piece of crap software is unstable and should have been tested more by its developers before releasing. Hardly a way of motivating people to use their Premium service. I never will."
725,Thymestep,"April 8, 2018",5,Great App For the first time in a few years I feel successful. Tracking food is so easy using the search bar. Every food is listed! Exercise tracking is extremely helpful and rewarding. I am sticking to this as I feel like my IPad is following me around and tapping me on the back and making me stick to my diet and exercise. I lost 5 pounds in one month which is healthy! I am now determined and happy because my goals are easier to follow with My Fitness Pal app.
726,KWJohns,"May 22, 2018",5,"Continues to amaze me I downloaded this app to count calories. It does it, and it does it well."
727,LMSiegel13,"May 26, 2018",5,"Best app for food tracking This is the best app I‚Äôve found for tracking food. The database is huge for pre-packaged items and restaurants, plus all the homemade recipes. The ability to pull online recipes and create your own is amazing. It takes some practice, but previously used items are readily available to find again. It‚Äôs easy to set your macros to adjust to whatever diet plan you‚Äôre using, from low-fat or low calorie to Keto."
728,BeePollenTomato,"July 12, 2018",1,Terrible customer support I have emailed customer support no less than 4 times since March (it‚Äôs June) for assistance in resetting my password with mostly no response. I received one cryptic reply that I responded to seeking clarification and that was also ignored. The ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù link will not send an automated email to my email address. So very frustrating - especially since I just want to delete my account since the privacy leak occurred via this company when they were hacked.
729,Hannahislost,"August 16, 2018",1,Outdated health information I follow a ketogenic diet and I eat a lot of healthy fats. I get tired of getting yelled at in red warning me this food is high in saturated fat. Saturated fat isn‚Äôt unhealthy.

734,Barrynof,"December 16, 2019",2,"Good feature rarely works I absolutely love the idea of this app, but one of it‚Äôs best features doesn‚Äôt work. The feature is the meal feature. You can save meals in the app and use those instead of having to type in each individual part of the meal. The problem is that when I try this, the app will not place each part of the meal in. So, I am left with having to look for what is missing and it takes me just as long as it would if I had just put each item in separately. Fix this one very frustrating thing and this gets 5 stars. Without that feature, though, this app is MEH!"

I finished my diary the other day and hit complete entry, and it told me I would weigh 1.2 pounds in five weeks. I shared a screenshot of it on my Facebook because it‚Äôs hilarious and ridiculous.

There‚Äôs an annoying bug right now though, I waited a while to report it but not seeing a fix so here it is - when I enter a meal and save it, I can see refreshed calorie count on that screen, but if I go to the Home screen from the tab on the bottom, Home doesn‚Äôt reflect the new info.   This stinks if I‚Äôm trying to plan what I‚Äôll eat for lunch or dinner in advance, or just see how I‚Äôm doing after that meal.

It calculates calories, by listing an astronomical  number of meals and foods, and their calorie equivalents.  It keeps track of your progress losing weight.  It tells you if you‚Äôre eating too much fat or sodium, etc.  It enables you to log your exercise, and how many calls you‚Äôve burned.  In summation, this app keeps you accountable to the level you want."
743,Famous ways,"February 8, 2018",4,Great app just one thing. This app is all around a great app. Even the free version. It tracks everything you need it to except if you fast. I do fast 3 to 4 times a week. But when you don‚Äôt log anything nutrition wise it say it doesn‚Äôt recommend not eating. But that‚Äôs what you do on a fast. You don‚Äôt eat. If you could implement a separate fasting tracker where when you don‚Äôt log food but manually select that your fasting this would be the all around fitness app in my opinion. Otherwise great job!
744,Jarjizzle,"October 9, 2018",4,Best fitness app out there for tracking diet The only reason it‚Äôs not a 5 star is cause it crashes frequently. That‚Äôs it.

For me who has years of historical data in the ecosystem it is a pain point but I‚Äôm going to keep using it largely for that reason.

There is no option to opt out of this invasion of privacy!    I have searched through all of the settings and can not find anyplace where I can disable this prompt or opt out of privacy sharing.

I understand that the idea is to get you to pay but that probably doesn‚Äôt change the all around interface in regards to putting in foods and meals and sharing. That needs to be overhauled.

751,Pattischu,"April 24, 2018",4,"Add a caffeine tracker! I‚Äôve been using this app since 2011, maybe longer. It surpasses most of the others out there last time I checked. I monitor not only my calories but more importantly my blood sugar by watching how much sugar I consume compared to protein and fiber each day. Tracking fitness helps me keep track to f that as well. My biggest suggestion would be to add tracking for caffeine for those who want or need to limit the amount they consume! I am constantly wondering why none of the apps do this!"

Seems after much trial end error, problem is that the web site has some very old meal data (from 2016 when I tried to use it last time). The old data cannot be deleted from the web site. (generates an error and allegedly notifies support). If it is deleted from the iphone app, it deletes it from the phone, but will not sync until the app is re-installed."

My one and only complaint is that I am constantly having issues connecting my Fitbit exercise information to this app. I think what makes it so annoying is that even after the trouble shooting it‚Äôs only fixes the issues temporarily. I wish they would focus on fixing that one flaw because it makes me less likely to use this app when I can‚Äôt have an accurate reading of the exercise I have done that day and how it impacts my calorie intake."

The app constantly crashes while I‚Äôm in the middle of adding items to my food diary. I only have it open for less than 5 seconds before it crashes. I updated the app and it still continues to crash. I cannot even finish adding a recipe bc it crashes before I can even add one ingredient. Just very disappointed in it since I started using it again this past week."

I tried to add one recipe for my breakfast one day. Each time i got almost everything added, before it was saved, the screen would go black and i was back to the apple home screen. I tried this 8 times before i gave up on the app and stopped making updates. I now just use it to find the nutritional facts on produce. I‚Äôm not sure whats going on, but the app has become irritating at best and currently is not worth the aggravation!"
757,austinmarxx,"March 20, 2019",3,"Great app but super glitchy and slow MyFitnessPal is great. It has a very extensive food data base, comprehensive nutrient tables and an accurate calorie calculator based on goals and body composition. My only gripe, and BIGGEST annoyance about the app is that it is very very glitchy at times. Sometimes it freezes, is unresponsive, and in worst cases, just plain crashes on me. The fact that under armour has its name associated with the app would lead me to believe that technical issues like this would be ironed out and resolved, and the app would run at peak function. Please fix!! Otherwise, great app."

That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. I have when developers get greedy and make you pay for something you used to get for free. And I‚Äôm am not sorry to say that this app doesn‚Äôt offer anything with $10/month or $50/year. Absolutely nothing. It is a great tracking app. But not worth that.

It logs your food and nutritional facts so easily you can scan a barcode and it automatically logs it in your daily dietary facts. Also keeping track of your weight is a huge motivator trying to gain weight and trying to lose weight as well. I rate this app 15/10 and would recommend to anyone looking to lose or gain weight.

I started using it and it showed me how much sodium I consume and it really helped me to show me that I needed to change my diet.

Sometimes I find myself trying to plug in a different combination of foods to see how I can best reach my macro goals. So it made me think: what if there was a way that the app can figure it out for you?  Using the foods you regularly eat (and even other suggestions), the app will tell you what combination of foods/serving size you should eat to meet your macro goals before the end of the day. Hope that made sense!"

However as of late it keeps reminding me to add my meal as if I haven‚Äôt added them already which in most cases I have.

I oils rate this 4 or 5 stars if the developers unlocked that for free use. I mean we are all trying to get healthier right?

I thought the poly and mono were the heart healthy ones that you want in moderation.

While I don't believe the scale is perfectly accurate, it is precise enough for what I want to do which is monitor body fat % and weight. I want to gain 5 lb, and this app calculates the necessary calories to do that while accounting for calories burned during exercise."

I‚Äôve worked with multiple nutritionist that can look into my app to read what I‚Äôve logged and change my macros accordingly. I would advise working with a professional versus relying on the app for your calorie and macros because it typically puts you in a deficit lower than your BMR which is not good.

I had been working out 5 days a week but hadn‚Äôt changed the way I was eating. Finally had to admit that I needed to make some better food choices. Particularly in the area of sugars & carbs.

I also like how it reminds me to put my meals in so I can really keep track of my calorie intake. It lets you know when you go over you're recommended daily values so you can try to cut out that stuff, and also lets you know if your food is good for you by telling you it has lots of protein. Overall good app!"

I use an app called Fitbod, it's like a handheld personal trainer mainly for strength based workouts, and My Fitness Pal does not have the option to pair with other apps, not even through My Health on iPhones. Not only that but the cardio workouts are unrealistic with the calories burned. Fitness crazes like tabata or even hiit burn more calories through interval training and you can't log this on the app."

844,khmute,"January 24, 2018",2,"Woefully inadequate on serving options My biggest complaint with this app is that you have to do some weird shenanigans to figure out an adjusted serving size from the standard.  For instance, I wanted to add chia seeds to my daily breakfast entry.  The standard serving is 1/4 cup.  Well, I used 2 tsps. There is no entry for 2 tsps of chia seeds.  So I have to do some weird math to figure out that 2 tsps is the same as 1/9 of a standard 1/4 cup serving???  Or scan through dozens of entries of chia seeds where someone else just happened to eat 2 tsps too?  That‚Äôs insane.  I can find another app ‚Äî My Net Diary ‚Äî which does the math for me.

To me, again way too much effort to figure out how to change it. (fyi: you have to tap the tiniest check mark in the blue bar when done. It's practically non existent).

One thing that would be very helpful would be to be able to edit foods you eat at restaurants.  Went to a couple of places and found their items in the app, but because I take off all the bread and dressings from salads and meals it is not an accurate reflection of what I actually am eating unless I build it from scratch.

This app is so stupid. And then this morning, for whatever reason, it started to deduct some random number that isn‚Äôt even on Garmin app. Total waste of time to even try out for free. $79/year is completely insane for this no functional app."

879,Ipatrick69,"July 13, 2019",1,Doesn‚Äôt work well with Apple Watch Either incompetent programmers or they‚Äôre just trying to push you to buy premium to somehow make this thing work. Their retarded negative calorie adjustment setting is ridiculous. Whether activated or deactivated any calories expended will be subtracted from your daily caloric goals so that if your goal is 2500 cal and you do 500 cal worth of work it will display that you have 2000 cal left for the day rather than 3000. It‚Äôs basic math and they can‚Äôt figure it out. It usually corrects itself by evening time but by then it‚Äôs completely useless because you finished eating for the day. I guess you get what you pay for.

How very helpful!  Theres got to be something better, keep looking and for god sakes dont pay for this trash.  Even going through with monumental amounts of patience and at best you can actually enter everything and get it to stay but no promise itll be there later, it‚Äôs really a massive waste of time trying to use this app."

Now they want to push the premium subscription down everyone‚Äôs throat. Including advertisements? I get it. Lots of apps do that. But with every single update they remove more and more features and you can only get them if you pay $10 a month. On the latest they removed how you can see your intake breakdown (fats / carbs / protein). I used to recommend this app to everyone but I just deleted it off my phone.

This has been going on for over 6 months and I‚Äôve updated my device, the app, reset, redownload, re log in, etc. I‚Äôm going to find a new app now because this one went from being the thing I used to recommend to people the most to the thing that plagues me when I‚Äôm losing weight."

Tapping is sluggish or not responsive, so I usually have to tap more than once to do what I need.

I would like to monitor my sugar intake without worrying about natural sugars (a pretty standard nutrition goal I think) but that‚Äôs not possible, making this almost useless for me.

Doing so is no longer obvious/intuitive. Plus the requirement to type in the food name to search and then again to create the new meal makes for more typing than in the past.

I‚Äôve been using fractions for so long that most of my foods are ready to go with fractions.  I just have to make small adjustments on occasion.  But now I have to toggle back to fractions every time.  Can‚Äôt we pick our own default setting?  I understand having decimals as an option, but at this point, if you‚Äôve been using MFP for years, you don‚Äôt need decimals. Please give us an option!! Thank you!!"
937,JanetteCastle,"October 11, 2019",5,"Fitness goals met I have been using MyFitnessPal to track my progress and it‚Äôs an amazing tool to use for logging foods, learning about nutrition and helping you meet your fitness goals. Through this app I was able to make daily changes to my caloric and macro nutrient goals. I love how you can store meals for future use to make it easier to plug in on any given day. I‚Äôm enjoying this app and I recommend it to all."

Unfortunately, ‚Äúhave‚Äù is in giant quotation marks, because almost none of these features actually work. I sighed up for the paid Premium service in hopes of being able to enter custom foods in the ‚ÄúMy Foods‚Äù database. Yep, works for a few and then fails and won‚Äôt let me re-enter.  Saving meals? Again, software says it‚Äôs done but can‚Äôt then access the meals in their database. Fabulous design; horrible implementation. Very sad that they just don‚Äôt seem able to deliver on their great ideas.  Please don‚Äôt waste you money until they get it together on implementation."
939,Chuck MB,"August 27, 2019",5,Great weight loss tool I have always resisted this type of tool and have always struggled to lose weight. This app has made me so aware of what I was eating and how to adjust my food intake and lifestyle. It is incredibly easy to log in all foods your are eating by easy search and I am amazed by all foods they have information on calories. I would highly recommend I believe it is a huge difference maker .

Disappointed!!"
941,gtguess,"May 23, 2018",3,I‚Äôm finding a lot of discrepancies For example the orange juice I drink shows as 117 calories in the app but on the can it is 110.  The biggest one occurred today when I ate the chef salad at Sweet Peppers deli.  Your app says without dressing it is 640 calories and their website says it is 506.  That is a huge difference.   I have several other examples where I‚Äôve had to add my own food to be able to enter the calories correctly.  And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm picking the wrong food.  I am careful to make sure I‚Äôve got the right one.  I love this app but now I‚Äôm concerned.

I LOVE this app. This version though - it drains my battery when I use it (approximately half of my battery, to be clear), and my phone has begun overheating when I use it. I first believed it was my phone, but I‚Äôve troubleshot it down to happening when the app is running and not when it is not. Was there a massive change to the software of this app/ how it works? I feel like this was not a problem previously."

I don‚Äôt know why they would not include something so vital for so many low carb dieters! If MFP decides to include it it would definitely make this the perfect app but for now it falls short for me! It needs to be added!"

I love the app but find it funny that I can‚Äôt go back in and see what I ate to equal my daily intake for the day so I can start where I left off.  There‚Äôs no simple chart that pops up that says hey this is where you left off, for the kind of app this is I would expect there to be one."

It‚Äôs quite frustrating. I can‚Äôt just delete my account and switch apps, an instructor of mine is requiring that we use this app (even though it doesn‚Äôt work, most of the time.)

951,MaddieJones7,"January 14, 2018",5,"Love it At first, it‚Äôs hard to get used to using, but once you get the hang-of-it, it‚Äôs eye opening. Realizing what you put into your body finally, tracking it, motivates you to make better choices. The only bad thing is the beginning when you have to enter everything where as after awhile, you can reuse those entries! Love this app!

I‚Äôm trying it again a year later and it‚Äôs AWFUL there not many foods you can find from common places that you go to which other apps allow you to pull up when adding a meal. Most thing you have to put in manually what a waste time consuming. Not user friendly for people not familiar with the app even though I was I see how people may not use it to the fullest. I would NOT recommend paying premium!! If you don‚Äôt like the basic other one would you paying money for something you‚Äôre ready not liking

I may be doing something incorrectly which brings me to the second problem with this app, trying to reach out to tech support. Other than a tremendously long, overwhelming list of Q&A‚Äôs that they expect you to navigate (I certainly do not have this time or patience to do that), there is no option that allows for tech support contact.

960,tinytart23,"December 2, 2018",3,"Streak Measurement is Faulty While most of the  app is fine, I have had a bad experience with the 'Streak' feature. Basically, it is supposed to to tell you how many days in a a row you have logged. I had a streak that was nearing 300 days, when all the sudden it changed the number to 11 days, as if I had skipped a day. When I went back to check, I hadn't missed a single day. While it seems silly, it was a little source of pride and a fun incentive to keep logging. I hope they can fix how this feature works."
961,50nicknameater,"January 26, 2019",3,"Good, but... It is a good app for logging your calories, etc. I like that it interfaces easily with Apple Watch, etc. The problem is that it frequently makes you log back in and when that happens, bye bye history. None of your recent foods are there. Your past days are gone. It seems to save your ‚Äústreak‚Äù but everything else is gone. It‚Äôs like starting over. Every time that happens (once a month or so) it just kills your momentum because you have to go back and find foods again. I hate that."
962,English only,"February 24, 2019",5,You broke the iPad version. I payed for this app. And now you removed the macro totals (% and/or grams of fat carbs and protein) for the day from the food diary. But only on the iPad. It still is available on the phone. But the stupid tip it sideways to see the totals makes it difficult to use. Along with the fact that the phone is just too small.

After seeking support option, it's all about read yourself using app no link to contact help desk. Waste of my time! Now I need to call apple, and after a long hold request cancel.

971,Michael in Maryland,"October 5, 2017",2,"A half hearted attempt at socializing fitness I like the food logging flexibility.  I like the sports gear interfaces.  Advertisements are extreme, and upgrading too steep...should be $29; because it‚Äôs simply a logging mechanism.  Social interaction is clunky, and too static to encourage more effective interaction.  A simple ‚Äúreply‚Äù nested response option that allows a direct response to a comment would be a huge improvement.  Simple things would make it much better...instead; I‚Äôm looking for an app just marginally better to jump to.

Also, the food database is great, but really needs to be cleaned up.  I can search for one specific item and I'll get back 10+ options for it.  Even when I scan an item there's been many times that the information which comes up in the app doesn't match the nutrition label, even though it's ban marked as ""verified."""

If you want a to keep a long streak going do not to forget to track your  numbers, not even for one day.l or you will lose it. Since I could not get them to add the missing day in, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app. I use to recommended this app all of the time. I lost two long streaks the first One was for 361 days and the last streak I lost was 793 days when I lost it. I lost 53lbs., but when an app malfunctions would you want to use it?

I even have to end the process when I'm not using it in order to stop the battery drain.  Phone also gets physically warm when using for more than a minute or two.

Helps you become aware of how many calories are in food and makes you focus on important things such as caloric deficit and just being active.

Switching between ‚Äúfrequent‚Äù and ‚Äúrecent‚Äù foods takes multiple steps. The barcode reader disappears if you try to search, making you go back out to the main diary home screen. Come on,  MFP!

Doesn‚Äôt even have Google Fit OS as an option for all of those who have Google SmartWatches. Many brands of watches use this technology but I haven‚Äôt seen MFP add any new wearable tech options so we can integrate our steps/activity with MFP.

But the reason why I gave it 4 out if 5 stars is because there is a lot of false nutritional information provided for the same product when conducting a food search.  You need to be careful which one you select and check the nutritional information on the container before making a selection.

I used to love this app. But now it is very very glitchy and I barely use it because the all of the glitches bother me a lot and it makes it frustrating to use the app. Sometimes it doubles my food. It always takes a long time to move from date to date and the daily calorie consumption sometimes never shows. When I want to add something it glitches when I click on add food and when I add it, it takes a while to show up which is then followed by more glitches. This app used to be flawless. It used to never glitch. But now it is impossible to use this app."

I recently purchase an Apple Watch and appreciate the constant connection of my exercise with the app. One area I‚Äôve found that is flawed is when I workout twice in one day, the adjustment feature goes out of wack. I burned over 500 calories in two walks and the system subtracted my calories from days allotment instead of adding calories to use."

It used to sync to my Fitbit and log the calories from my workouts but it no longer does, unsure of this is due to Fitbit or MyFitnessPal though. EDIT to reduce to 3 stars. The lag time has been awful and I see from other reviews that it doesn‚Äôt sync to any apps anymore which caused my Fitbit issue."

I prefer to use the iPad app since the iPhone version you have to turn your phone to the side to check the macros and the desktop version does not have auto fill when you want to add a food.

Some foods must be incorrectly entered into their database, making this app pretty useless. They also try to force you to pick food from your history rather than from their database, which is extremely frustrating. This app also does not allow you to change the serving/portion size of any food you want to enter... Why?!"

1129,PSL Pat,"September 30, 2019",5,Works great for me This is the second time in 6 years that I‚Äôve used My Fitness Pal.  Both times I lost 15 plus pounds.  I started this year on Jan 7 at 200 and have been maintaining 185 or less for about 6 months.  Takes minutes to enter my data and encourages me to be aware of calories consumed.  I also sync it with my Garmin Vivofit for an even better experience.
1130,JustMeV,"October 22, 2018",4,"Exercise penalty bug It‚Äôs a great app except it adds exercise calories to your daily intake instead of adding them to daily allowance (or subtracting from intake). I have to do the math in my head and it always looks like my intake is over my allowance for the day, which is a bit demoralizing for someone like me, who has a hard enough time finding the self discipline to use the app. Otherwise it integrates very nicely with iPhone‚Äôs health app and the Fitbit app."
1131,Deedeeme6,"January 9, 2019",5,"Great when it syncs, terribly frustrating when it doesn‚Äôt. It seems about once a month, there are syncing issues between MFP and Fitbit.  "
1132,Caroleillo,"February 20, 2019",3,"Maybe it‚Äôs me I had to delete the app. t I didn‚Äôt enter √† dinner. I entered it the morning after. However,  my entry was attached to today‚Äôs dinner. Afterward, I saw that I could go back to yesterday, but not clear if I have the option of entering my missing dinner."
1133,LCRMPB13,"February 24, 2019",1,Great until latest update The last update killed this app. The changes were rather extreme and not the least helpful. Trying to track specific things now is a nuisance and not worth the hassle. I used to be able to be able to adjust what I see on the main tracking page - fiber and sodium was of a couple of them I had for easy tracking. Now I have to constantly go back and forth between the nutrition and the main tracking page to see my overall sodium and fiber intake - it‚Äôs tedious. I‚Äôll definitely be looking for a new app if things don‚Äôt improve.
1134,SSJBE Vegeta,"May 3, 2019",5,"Reliable, Efficient, and Excellent!! Can‚Äôt say enough about the app!! It‚Äôs user-friendly, detailed, and equipped with great features! I just wish you could change the order of how logged foods show up, like sliding them up and down the list for meals instead of having to remove and re-scan the previous foods (a tad OCD, I know, but still). It‚Äôs a great app otherwise!"
1135,Poor as Rich is taken. LOL,"May 22, 2019",5,"Weight loss Using this program keeps me on track to lose the pounds and reminds me I‚Äôm slipping when I ease off my eating habits as the pounds creep up. Every time I‚Äôm serious with this program and walking for exercise the pounds drop. I‚Äôm over 50 lbs lighter and much healthier as my BP is in the normal to elevated and without the two drugs I was on for the past six plus years, finally. It is a fantastic aid!"
1136,E.G. Gan,"June 5, 2019",5,"Not as proud as I once was. I normally would have given My Fitness Pal a five star review, but all of a sudden it quit picking up my exercise from my Fitbit.  I‚Äôve done everything trying to get it to reconnect. Disconnected it from the Fitibt App and even deleted it and reinstalled it.  It just is not picking up my Fitbit.  I still use it to count my calories.  If not for that, it would be worthless to me."
1137,RitaMarki1,"September 10, 2019",5,"I love it! What an awesome feature would it be if we could add a mark, like a rating to every meal - are we satisfied about it in specific way. Maybe its a meal you cooked home and it makes you proud, or you managed to make it 100% vegan or else. I think adding a little star in the line with calorie number will make personal meaning for everyone, I would use it for sure üòä"
1138,Atxbeauty,"September 10, 2019",5,"Great app This app has helped me achieve weight loss that I felt was not possible. Since I no longer have a fully functioning thyroid, weight loss has been extremely hard, even as a physically active and diet conscious person, it has been a struggle. This app allowed me to pinpoint exactly how many calories I could consume in order to lose weight. I highly recommend it."
1139,The queen44,"June 26, 2019",3,"Change not for the better The recent change for finding food on the ‚Äòhistory‚Äô list could be great, but the default setting is ‚Äòmost recent‚Äô.  I prefer the A‚ÄîZ option.  Every time one adds a food, the ‚Äòmost recent‚Äô comes up, even if you moments before the default had been changed to A‚ÄîZ.  It seems that it would be easy to program a personal preference for the default.  It‚Äôs done when choosing a ‚Äòserving‚Äô for food.  Why not for history?"
1140,HCoffin,"September 30, 2017",4,Love it and a nice tool This has nice features and ease of use. You can sync this app with Fitbit app and will adjust calories based on activity. I did4 stars instead of five because the app use to have a feature of just adding calories and that is longer available. I liked that feature for when an item wasn't in the data base and I could just add the calorie amount. Otherwise a very useful app to support a healthy diet.
1141,18 yr old male,"October 30, 2017",5,Lost 30lbs in 4 and 1/2 months. Started in june and haven't looked back. I weighed in at 195lbs (pretty much all fat) and now I weigh 165. This app counts my steps whenever it's not even on so whenever I'm done with a long walk I see how much calories i've earned. I set my goal to two pounds a week and i've basically hit my goal every week. This app is so easy to use and is a necessity for me everyday.
1142,Scany1,"December 21, 2017",5,"The best app for weight loss or just good nutrition Starting using the app to reduce my sodium intake. Two years later, I‚Äôm down 40lbs. Now I‚Äôm paying attention to potassium, calcium and fiber. Didn‚Äôt realize I wasn‚Äôt getting enough. I‚Äôm off of Facebook and have made new friends on the MFP app. I check in many times a day to know how many steps I make and how many calories it bought me. Love this app!"
1143,Elliemay009,"February 26, 2018",4,"Easy to use, lots of foods saved for entry look up Love the scanning option and the nutrition wheel to monitor balance of macros. I also like being able to track my nutrient intake like calcium and iron. Overall pretty easy to use and has a good library of foods available, but the calorie content varies a lot if you have to look something up. That makes it hard to be accurate sometimes, but overall it's a good app."
1144,Greeneyed Sheba,"May 12, 2018",4,"Great but not perfect This is a great tool to help you with monitoring your intake but not so good on you‚Äôre outtake. It is logged into my iPhone so it automatically take the steps from my iPhone, however my iPhone is not always with me and therefore it does not log all my steps. There is a variety of pedometer apps you can link to, however it does not except mine which is the VeryFitPro. Needs to have the capability to search for various pedometer apps."
1145,Rzorbkchick,"May 14, 2018",2,Still learning how to use I am on day 3 of tracking with this app and still finding my way around each feature. My biggest issue right now is trying to add my walking as an exercise. The app has prebuilt and has gives no opportunity to edit- such as I walk each morning and usually around 1.5 miles and a moderate pace (so abt 20 minutes). The app only lets me add in the prebuilt which doesn‚Äôt match my routine. And if I try to add it only asks for duration and calories burned! I have no idea how to answer that one!
1146,DC Panda Bear,"May 21, 2018",4,"Food tracker is great! Love the fact that I can scan the product and it will automatically feed in the nutrition facts.  Saves me time from entering it in manually.  And, it also has the nutrition for restaurants!  "
1147,Droppin birds,"August 21, 2018",2,"Great improvements to logging calories but crashes constantly I applaud the improved options such as scanning barcodes, and the larger community has logged quite a few items, which makes things easier. But operating on 11.4.1? Maybe it‚Äôs just my iPhone 8, but this app crashes CONSTANTLY, particularly when I‚Äôm entering a new item for the first time. As a result, I frequently only can enter the calorie count and not the nutritional information, which benefits nobody... Please get this back to basic operating level! I love your app and want it to shine."
1148,Disjdjcbs,"September 12, 2018",3,"Love but.. I‚Äôve been using this app for years and I love it. however, for the past 6 months, the app will randomly slow down, glitch, and shut down. In the middle of logging, making notes, and checking my macros, it will shut down and have to start up all over again so i can see my macros! it‚Äôs very inconvenient! And now, it will not allow me to upload a progress picture with my weight. These things need to be fixed to be an effective app."
1149,CocoPuff62,"April 30, 2020",5,"Weight Loss 101 This app is amazing, it makes losing weight so much simpler. There‚Äôs nearly nothing to do when you use this app, it does all the work for you.

If I have to start over again, I‚Äôll just begin with a different app."
1151,Techy-1,"May 29, 2019",5,Helps keep me motivated! I have struggled with my weight since I got sick in my early 30‚Äôs. Before that I never had any issues with my weight or with food. Now it seems like everything I eat sticks to my mid section like a fly to fly paper. It‚Äôs imperative for me to keep track of my daily calories in order not to gain pounds. This app makes this task very easy. Highly Recommended!
1152,Frostymcman,"March 22, 2020",4,"Steps disappear One of the major issues that annoys me the most is when I use map my walk and it updates MyFitnessPal on the calories I‚Äôve burned, and it decides to drop any other calories I burned with my steps before I went on that walk. I walked 1,500 steps before I decided to go for a walk and track it, but now it‚Äôs saying that those 1,500 steps counted for nothing and dropped the calories burned from those to zero."
1153,Parent / teacher,"February 21, 2020",5,"Great! Only one complaint I love the app, it does everything I need it to.  The only small complaint is that 30 minutes after I log my meal.  It reminds me that I have not yet logged my meal.  If I don‚Äôt log the meal, I don‚Äôt get a reminder. If I log early, 30 minutes later, don‚Äôt forget to log your meal. If I log late, 30 minutes later, you haven‚Äôt logged your ‚Äòmeal‚Äô today."
1154,jFitz32,"February 6, 2020",2,"Great app. When it works which is 50/50. Several bugs in the app causing it to constantly freeze and crash while adding food, workouts from Apple Watch and wahoo  sync maybe one of every three times.  App needs an update. Bugs fixed, dark mode, better reliability.  LiveStrong My Plate has all the above and works flawlessly. The only thing keeping me from switching is My Fitness Pal has a much larger database of foods. Otherwize I‚Äôd be switching. I hope with the next version I can change my review to 5 starts but for now it a 2 star app."
1155,DJ Big Edd,"October 26, 2019",5,"Convenient All these diet fabs out there never work for me, but I have found out that monitoring my calorie intake is the best thing for me, and being able to put your desired goal and MyFitnessPal telling how many calories you have for the day really helps. So far I‚Äôm down 7 lbs in 4 weeks, just the pace that I wanted from MyFitnessPal. Thank you so much MyFitnessPal, you‚Äôre a blessing."
1156,calories burned,"October 15, 2019",3,"Need to be able to add calories burned for resistance training Just about everyone these days that uses an app like this also uses some type of fitness tracker like a fitbit or Apple Watch. They are able to track their calories burned through a plethora of different types of workouts other than cardio workouts. In this app, you should be able to add calories burned for resistance or strength training to be able to adjust your caloric intake just as the app does if you add a cardio workout."
1157,Ryanxj9000,"October 12, 2019",3,"Good, but recent bugs are killing it For some reason the app keeps resetting my calories, and other nutritional goals with a mind of it‚Äôs own. I am supposed to maintain weight at 2,350 calories, after inputting my info, goals, and activity level which comes out to 2,350cals. Then randomly after a couple days the app just changes that to 1,850cals, and also deletes the nutritional goals I manually set for certain other nutrients (mono and poly fats) back to 0 grams. Prior to this it was working fine."
1158,kospiah28,"August 28, 2019",4,Great App but... I so want to give this 5 stars. Ive been using it for years and it‚Äôs truly helped to keep me accountable to myself. 
1159,78 Bus,"August 7, 2019",4,"Needs a little tweaking Overall a great app. Takes some time to get around the glitches between strava and garmin device data. At times it will double up the amount of reported cardio so you‚Äôll have to go in and modify manually for accurate calorie and in/output. I would recommend this app for all kinds of use and monitoring if you need the help from a friend, nutritionist, or if you‚Äôre just plain competitive!"
1160,DrPapa1,"September 24, 2017",3,"Short on features Good for day to day tracking. MFP has helped me lose weight and get better control of my blood sugar. However, want to export your data for your doctor's use?  That will cost you at least $50 a year.  (Seems like extortion just to get MY data!)  Even then only a small portion of the info you have entered can be exported. (The details of food entered for each meal does not export.)  I have used MFP for several years but am now looking for a more user friendly app."
1161,Battery mattery,"September 25, 2017",5,"I've been using this for years. Love it. This is a great app for tracking calories. There are user submitted entries that you have to take with a grain of salt but it's mostly a huge convenience to have those in there. The ""frequently eaten"" tab never seems to work correctly for me, and some of the notifications of streaks seem inaccurate but overall it's excellent."
1162,5on E,"November 6, 2017",1,"I used to love this app, but... I used to use this app every day, and it helped me lose 80 lbs. however, since I got a new phone and re downloaded the app, I can't log in. It keeps saying that I don't have an account, but when I try to sign up for a new account it says that my email is already on an existing account. So frustrating. I have tried 4 or 5 times over the last 3 years to log in or set up an account, but it has never been fixed. I would still give it 5 stars if I could just log in, but it looks like I will never be able to use the app again."

This is a function i chose to enable to get a better read on my net calories available; however i can‚Äôt find an explanation on why i only got credit for 325 calories after a 7.2 mile brisk walk.  Besides that it‚Äôs easy to use & has a huge database of food & exercise available.
1164,seathinks,"February 28, 2018",2,"Not enough customization The whole tracking experience is tied to brands and I wasn‚Äôt able to find an option to track custom made food like salads or even home cooked food with multiple ingredients which makes all nutrition tracking useless. Example: I ordered custom salad from Sweet Green and wasn‚Äôt able to take advantage of tracking all goodness in it. I would also appreciate better integration with Map My Run, I exercise 5 times a week and it was totally ignored in this app that doesn‚Äôt allow me to track my progress."

1166,UserVGC,"April 15, 2018",4,"Great app - one suggestion I love this app.  The only thing I would add to it, since it appears the right components may already be there:  when I‚Äôve filled in my food for half to two-thirds of the day, and I have a few calories remaining, I‚Äôd like an area where I could turn for suggested foods fitting within my remaining calories. The suggested food would also help better align my remaining carbs, protein and fat for the day.  Keep up the good work!"

Makes tracking your calorie intake effortless."

I‚Äôve decided MyFitnessPal has the most features that I use regularly of the 3 apps. It would be greatly improved if they would allow you to favorite foods that you eat regularly for fast tracking. The only way I see to do this right now would be to add each food to my foods, which is time-consuming."

You can track your fitness by what acts you can perform and by what measurement. It seems this app focuses purely on weight loss. While that can be a good thing, I think in 2019 the focus of a self-described fitness app should be on fitness, including strength training; not diet and weight loss."

1176,Johanjrck,"August 18, 2019",5,Exactly what I‚Äôve wanted To be able to scan food and have data automatically logged takes all of the frustration out of counting calories.

1177,MtnSerenity,"August 1, 2019",3,Love the app Hate the Update Was 5 star rating until recent upgrade. The view is now a homogenous white blob. Was easier to find meals etc with some contrast. All white is NOT easier on the eyes. Some of my foods are missing and many I haven‚Äôt logged in a while are back. Lost Foods on the previous upgrade as well. Frustrating. This is a great app but change just to change when some of it doesn‚Äôt need fixing makes no sense. Bring back some contrast to this. Please.

Doctor told me to lower my sodium intake and it's been hell trying to figure out how to approach this.  The quick barcode scanner that imports the nutrition table makes an easy go of this.

1194,john12344433,"April 14, 2020",5,App gets better and better 2 years ago I requested that a calculator be put in the app because I hated going back and forth to my calculator app when inputting partial portions of food. Idk how long it‚Äôs been there but there is now an option to enter a fraction instead of a decimal!!! I give feedback to a LOT of apps and have never been listened to. Very happy with this app.

Their suggestions have not helped . There is no phone # or human being to call for help either, as far as I can see. I am very frustrated and disappointed"
1198,Kcory002,"September 21, 2019",5,Seamless Easy to use app and features. Really like how there is such an array of food options to select from; you can scan a barcode for food or add in your own information for a dish you‚Äôve made. Love that it connects with both Map My Run and Map My Ride and will automatically put in the information from your activity with calories.
1199,curtjames,"July 25, 2019",5,"What a resource! Myfitnesspal is an incredible resource that allows you to achieve your goals.

1200,Annaeeee,"September 16, 2017",4,"Great app, but it freezes a lot I've been using the app for the past month and it's very easy to use. You can add your own recipes, which helps to keep track of literally everything you eat. The only problem I have with it so far is that it freezes right in the middle of adding food, adding a recipe, etc. It stops responding to taps, yet it doesn't close (crash). Other than that, it's a great app."

Many times these are one time food choices and they end up taking up a lot of space in the food diary. I read that you could go online and delete the foods but that did not work for me.

Previously, you could create a custom food entry directly from your daily log - now you have to leave your food diary and move through multiple screens in order to get to the same functionality. Searching for foods I have used before, even using the identical title, is much less reliable. I‚Äôm finding the whole process extremely frustrating.

After contacting Apple about the charge I was told there is nothing they could do and therefore I am out the $54 the app charged with no other recourse.

I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight over the last 6 months and I‚Äôve managed to lose 36 lbs so far.  I‚Äôve found that I really need to weigh in every day to stay motivated.

My suggestion is-I wish I could set goals for more than just carbs, fat, and protein. I‚Äôd like to be able to set goals for the macronutrients too, as I need to keep my eye on potassium, fiber (less than your goal), etc.  Also, if you could add magnesium to the list of macronutrients."

It was better before UA took it over and I wasn‚Äôt taunted to ‚Äúgo premium‚Äù to get additional functionality. I continue to use it because I have recipes and meals saved, and I like it. My issues: it‚Äôs made for calorie-counting and doesn‚Äôt have features to work seamlessly with other diet programs, there are no net carbs or alcohol sugars. You can work around that, however, with the crowdsourced database, I find a lot of erroneous entries that make this tedious.

Logging everyday has helped me know how many calories I am consuming and which foods are good choices of protein and fiber, and which are high in fats, sugar, and sodium. I‚Äôve had a gastric bypass and tracking food is a huge part of maintaining progress. I have lost almost 100 pounds this year!"
1283,BraNails,"February 13, 2018",4,Calories for steps and exercise I love all the features this app has! The only thing reason it's not 5 stars is because every time I add an exercise it takes away my step calories even though my phone was not moving (and therefore not counting steps) during the time I was working out. Would love to have an accurate representation of both calories burned from steps and exercise!

1286,Mr_Teacher_Mang,"April 7, 2018",1,"No easy way to track net carbs I eat a pretty strict keto diet and as such I am constantly tracking net carbs (specifically total carbs minus fiber and sugar alcohols). With MFP you can track your fiber but there is no way to track sugar alcohols. I upgraded to premium in the hopes that it would allow more customization to do so but it just doesn‚Äôt. I saw in there MFP blog from over 2 years ago (Mar 2016) that someone requested this and the response from MFP was essentially ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a something we‚Äôre even considering‚Äù. So if you need an app to help track your ketogenic diet, look somewhere else because MFP is not your answer."

Before this app was crippled by the disgusting amount of ads and performance destroying notifications, I would have ZERO complaints.

They removed important features in this latest update...shame on you.  Now, the diary no longer shows important nutrients like carbs, fat, protein, sodium, and sugar.  This is a serious issue for diabetics counting carbs for every meal and snack.  They did this to force you to upgrade which requires a monthly fee.  If you want to charge a one-time fee like some other great apps like Procreate, that‚Äôs fine; however changing your app to require a monthly fee is inexcusable."

Right off, I‚Äôm disappointed that it doesn‚Äôt calculate net carbs, and trying to find the right food from lists of hundreds is monotonous. Some kind of sorting would be great. I‚Äôd consider the premium upgrade if I could find out how much it is without committing to a free trial. Been there and done that."
1339,MelSweet2019,"April 13, 2019",1,"BEWARE OF LATEST UPDATE PRIVACY CONCERN The latest update is generating a pop-up that asks you to turn on precise location tracking in order for the app to target you with ads. The pop-up DOES NOT allow you to opt-out of this tracking. The only options are to accept or ‚ÄúRemind Me Later‚Äù. If you select ‚ÄúRemind Me Later‚Äù and then re-open the app, you see the pop up again. This essentially forces you to deal with pop-up harassment or opt into the tracking. As a long time user of this app, I am extremely disappointed and will stop using the app until this is corrected."
1340,SDoggyDogg,"September 29, 2017",5,Great way to track calorie consumption! I have been using this for about 9 months and I love it. It is super easy to enter your daily food consumption and exercise regimen. The graphics and charts are very helpful and easy to read. I have enjoyed entering my data and seeing my progress against my goals. I have lost 17 pounds since I started using the app.
1341,Ladykbuzz,"October 15, 2017",3,"Great (minus pop up ads) I love this app for keeping track of steps, exercise and what I was eating.  I've used it off and on for long period of time when I was focusing on healthy habits. It was easy to use and no fuss - until they started running video pop up ads for ""non-premium"" users.  I can't add a food without a 4 second ad popping up each time I go to the screen (Seems to be an issue with video ads?). Ads shouldn't affect the usability of an app."
1342,Ajcrz224,"October 15, 2017",4,"Great app! I love the app, and only typhus I have it 4 starts is that because when it shows your steps it only shows steps that your iPhone has counted, I have an Apple Watch and that does most of the counting not my iPhone. So it says now that I got like 1,000 steps in yet I know I got way over that and when I look in the health app it says that I got 12,000 steps in, of which most were entered into it by my Apple Watch."

1344,Nebraska Mike,"January 3, 2018",4,I‚Äôm liking this App! Off to a good New Year with this App. One of my buddies used it & is down 95 lbs!  I‚Äôve been trying to get under 200 for a few years & hope this tool will help. 
1345,VLN23,"January 12, 2018",3,Settings won‚Äôt stay My fitness is one of the best apps out there for tracking but I am having a consistent problem with the goals and percentages changing back to default. It does it on its own multiple times a day. This creates a problem if I don‚Äôt realize this has occurred and it seems the numbers are off.  I have to change my settings back continuously to see what my actual macros are. Other than this I really like the app.
1346,Snqqpy2,"March 2, 2018",5,Great In the past I belonged to Weight Watchers. This app is everything theirs was and more! The restaurant feature finds local restaurants near you. Pick the one you‚Äôre at and you can enter your foods from the pre-populated menu. Another great feature is the recipe feature. You can copy and paste a recipe and it will automatically calculate the nutritional value

1350,Bmanning614,"March 30, 2020",5,Perfect app! This app has been extremely helpful with counting not only calories but macronutrients as well. My favorite feature is being able to see what I ate/drank that day that was highest in fats/carbs so I know what to avoid or limit the next day. I highly recommend this app for anyone trying to lose weight or cut away some body fat.

I will stay on to keep myself honest in the future, too, as I see it as a long-range tool."

Second, the ability to be able to read water input from HealthKit, not just write it. And third, maybe give the option to not see so much of the articles. I want to use this app for calorie tracking, and seeing my health data, not articles!"
1354,Jesusgirlhasarrived,"December 17, 2019",3,"Good app, but some complaints So, I‚Äôve used this app for a little over a month now and lost around 5 pounds, but I suddenly just stopped losing. Not sure why. I have been eating around 1000 calories a day but not exercising, I wish there was a feature where you could say how fast you could lose weight and it create a personalized diet plan for you.

For people with a low budget or who just don‚Äôt care enough to pay for one (like me), it‚Äôs amazing to have this app.  The best part is how you can type in what you‚Äôre eating and it will automatically enter all the nutrition info for that food.

But for a while now it has been very glitchy. It‚Äôs super slow, doesn‚Äôt react when I tap on items, closes out all the time. I use this app many times a day and it‚Äôs super frustrating and disappointing that it‚Äôs so difficult to use! Please please fix this because I can‚Äôt diet without this app!"

1368,Nookster480,"June 23, 2019",3,"Not sure what happened As a premium subscriber I expect the app to work consistently, however these updates are consistently breaking what wasn‚Äôt broken to begin with.  It worked perfectly for a year and now doesn‚Äôt show added totals at bottom of day,as well as glitches out some days entirely making the tracking useless.  Luckily the website works but the app has become a crapshoot.  Go back to what worked please."
1369,Ray Northman,"June 10, 2019",1,"Inaccurate calorie math So, last I checked when you burn calories the total calories remaining is supposed to go up. Not the case in this app. The more calories I burn the less calories I have left. This app subtracts my calories burned from remaining calories along with subtracting food from my remaining calories. This leaves me with a lot of calories ‚Äúconsumed‚Äù by the end of the day. I weight train, run and train in Taekwondo, there is no reason why my exercise should be counted toward my overall calorie count. If this is not fixed soon I will be deleting the app and avoiding under armor apps altogether."
1370,Nickle8813,"August 6, 2018",3,"Great content, needs backend work The app is super great. It has lots of good logged that you can choose from, even restaurant menus. It‚Äôs easy to use and really helps accomplishing goals. However, it needs some work so it doesn‚Äôt drain the battery and crash so often. I was just trying to input my food from the other day and watched as my batter drained 25% If you look through too many days or try to add too much food in one sitting, it will crash."

It has deleted all of my goals, macros, calorie counts, foods I‚Äôve frequently eaten and foods I‚Äôve created. It‚Äôs the most discouraging thing, to go through your day entering all your stuff just to see it delete everything throughout the day. As you sit down for dinner and go to enter it into the app. I‚Äôll be deleting and not recommending it to anyone."

But for the last 2 weeks the app freezes and does not respond to anything. I close it and reopen only to find it still frozen on the last screen. After several attempts it finally reboots and reopens it. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating as I can‚Äôt track anything because it won‚Äôt move screens. I think there might need to be an update to fix this.

I like the options of following my progress and how easy it it to track my food intake.  The ability to see easily how much under or over I am helps me to make choices easier and with the daily breakdown it helps me make better choices.
1388,cdamayor,"May 17, 2018",5,"The perfect meal tracker This app is amazing. It does everything MyPlate doesn‚Äôt. You can enter your own recipes and make meals out of barcode scanned foods with ease.

I can‚Äôt help but believe it is all part of an effort to influence you to join one of the plans that include a fee. It is a shame, and I am very disappointed. Not everyone can afford 5 - 10 dollars a month."
1392,goldbeer316,"March 27, 2019",5,Restaurant menu availability and accuracy I really have enjoyed the app so far however it‚Äôs really disappointing at how outdated many of the menus are and how many of the large name vendors like Texas Road houses menu is not available and when you request it the menu is NEVER uploaded into the app. This would make it so much more user friendly

If it was just $10 to remove ads and buy it I would do it in a heartbeat. Frustrating enough that the moment an alternative gets a large enough food database I‚Äôm moving to it."

But again, for $9.99, it should do these things. You can do much better getting the Keto Diet app instead. It‚Äôs not perfect but at least most of the nutritional info is correct and I don‚Äôt have to figure out net carbs. It‚Äôs also only $2.99 a month. That‚Äôs $7 less with better functionality."

After putting in the weights and serving size from your meal, the next day you go to log it and it‚Äôs nowhere to be found. I have the paid version and I‚Äôm DEFINITELY not going to renew when the time comes around. This is a popular food logging app but believe me, there are much better alternatives."

I had the opinion that even the healthy foods didn't count towards my weight loss because I didn't think they were a big deal. This app is the best if you really want to straighten out your eating habits and be honest with yourself!

I hate when I'm on the current day in the morning and I add my food and it updates to the previous day. I'd like to be able to delete my recipes I no longer want via the app vs having to go online from my computer.

1416,hthoman,"May 7, 2019",4,"Great app with lots of customizable options, but doesn‚Äôt show net carbs Overall a great app to set and track calorie and nutritional info. Premium features are useful (more customizable options), but the basic app has a lot of functionality that should work for most people that are generally trying to be more health-conscious. But for people with I insulin resistance, PCOS, diabetes or prediabetes, it can be a chore to calculate your net carbs."

I‚Äôve tried multiple times over several days, I‚Äôve even deleted and redownloaded the app, but I still get the same message.

Since humans are often creatures of habit. For example, cereal pops up early in the list for breakfast, rather than having to scroll through all the other foods eaten between the last time you had cereal last. It would make logging faster and more efficient."

My watch uploads my workout data to my phone but not to the app. Then it‚Äôs hard to put the right information into the app. After I I put the data as close as possible it shows different results than my watch. Map my run would be fine but I mostly use a treadmill.

Otherwise I am forced to use their standardized macro and calorie count (which are always wrong). I‚Äôve used this app for about five years. I put up with the ads you forced on us.

1424,Carnivore316,"October 9, 2018",3,"Great but has problems Great for tracking diet, calories, and macros. Major issue is that it is supposed to be compatible to sync with Fitbit tablet for step count, exercise, and calories burned. It constantly has issues with this.

I don't have a problem with having to tap to switch between percentages and grams, but recently the column headings have begun to say percentage even though the numbers change. To tell if the numbers showing are grams or percentage you have to find/know the grams for one of the logged foods to tell whether the number showing is a grams or a percentage number. Logging food is enough of a PITA without you making the task harder than it needs to be. Please fix."

Hope to loose the remaining half in the next year. Highly recommend

I am at least 20lbs over weight and calorie restriction is one of the best ways for me to get where I want to be.  I have studied Ray Cronise for the past two years.  His method works well.  Your app is not compatible with his method, but I plan to track my progress because what gets measured gets done.  Consider making changes.  Look at Ray‚Äôs research!  If I did not know any better your app would undermine my progress."

My dashboard keeps saying that after all my meals and a protein shake with at least 66 g, I've only eaten 30 g and have 10 left in the day.

1443,lavagirlxx,"April 11, 2020",2,"great intent, ugly outcome the idea of the app is amazing. it helps you track your calories, find new & fun recipes, and allows you to see your progression in numbers! but the major downside is, whether you‚Äôre looking to increase or decrease your calories, it causes you to look at your food as numbers. as someone who has both wanted to lose weight and gain it, this app kickstarted my obsession of tracking my calories. it‚Äôs less focused on the nutritional value of your foods, and more focused on the numbers going inside. myself, along with many others, find it so easy to get caught up with seeing the numbers on the scale rapidly decrease, that we easily forget the importance of nutrition and the effects that the food we eat has on our body. although this app has a positive and encouraging intent, it can turn ugly so fast."

I do not want location tracking, and there is no option that says ‚Äòdecline‚Äô.

Not a big deal but I‚Äôd irritating....  what else are they lax on????"
1551,cgftyjjbmkigd,"January 8, 2019",3,Disappointed I have only been using this app for a week or so. I have cancer and lost 40 pounds in the past months. I‚Äôm wanting to gain weight and felt this app would really be helpful...and it was until this evening. I open the app and it wouldn‚Äôt let me in. I had to delete it and reinstall.....and guess what? It‚Äôs a totally different format. The other format was so much easier to read.  I‚Äôm very disappointed....will be deleing it.

Please add the Bellabeat fitness tracker as one of the trackers that works with the My Fitnees Pal app for tracking steps.

1553,SPfeff001,"April 29, 2019",1,"Great idea... This app is great!!! WHEN IT WORKS, which is maybe 50% of the time. Sometimes it won‚Äôt sync up with my other apps. I need to go in a disconnect and then reconnect everything. Not exactly convenient. Today, it won‚Äôt open at all. Just says loading and then closes itself out. I have been using this app on and off and have been for over a year now. There‚Äôs always something going wrong with it. This honestly is the last straw. Fitbit lets you do all of the things this app does and so far seems WAAAAAY more reliable. So disappointing."

I will search for a food and it will say ‚Äúnothing matches your search‚Äù and a bar saying ‚Äúonline mode‚Äù pops up at the top. I‚Äôve tried various foods so i know it actually is in the search engine. I just don‚Äôt know why this bug is happening :/ very frustrating"

I sure hope it gets fixed because when it works well, it‚Äôs the best out there for tracking food!"

The report food button is right where you expect a confirm button and there is no ‚Äòare you sure‚Äô warning. I hope the algorithm can suss out mistakes cause I eat a lot of spinach and would like it to remain
1559,Lordtracedavid,"June 27, 2019",1,"Constantly logs you out No feature for ‚Äúremember my password‚Äù. App forces you to have an account so they can try to sell you under armour products. But once you log in, you better write your password down because the app logs you out every single day. I have had to reset my password at least 5 times. This is after I had my original account linked with Facebook which did make it easier. But then it would fail to log me in through Facebook. I am writing this as I wait for another password reset."

I have gotten into powerlifting over the last 18 months and decided to actually work on the most important aspect of fitness and progress which is FOOOOOD! Ate like crap and with this app it makes dieting seem wayyy less challenging.
1564,Lclod,"January 24, 2018",4,Rate this app. I enjoy how it keeps track of my calories and nutrients. However it wants me to add too many other apps. I already have ‚Äò map my run‚Äô now it wants me to add ‚Äò map my walk‚Äô plus it won‚Äôt use my same log in material. Also it doesn‚Äôt recognize many of my regular foods so I have to look up all the info. I have another ap that does recognize more of my foods.
1565,Colombiansoul324,"May 27, 2018",3,Measurements Very good app my only issue is that you should be able to add whatever combination of measurements for every food item. If you cook a lot it's hard to gauge how much you're eating if you're not able to chose whatever measurement you want especially when you create a meal it only says servings but idk if I'm missing it or it doesn't let you choose 1 cup 1/2 cup or whatever measurement you want. Very frustrating. ALSO VERY FRUSTRATING COLOMBIA IS SPELLED WRONG IT IS NOT SPELLED COLUMBIA!!!!!!

I have been paying for premium and the last week or so I haven‚Äôt been able to use a service I had paid for. I am not happy with this and I have been using this app for a long time.
1567,daisyMay19890456,"July 31, 2018",5,Day 1 I recently downloaded the app and I love how it keeps track of all your meal and tracks your goal.

1568,Bree Ce,"August 18, 2018",2,"Age and overall confusing I tried using this on the computer like two/three years ago I used this with my grandmother and loved it, now I‚Äôm trying the app, my first problem was it wouldn‚Äôt let me in with my age?? Like you‚Äôre supposed to be over 18 but I don‚Äôt understand why, I‚Äôm almost 16 and was excited to try this app to try and lose some weight, I got permission and made an account just to see what it was like and I could hardly make sense of it, maybe it‚Äôs just me tho idk"

This app is awesome for what ever your strength or fat loss goals are. It keeps you focused and able to track your diet. FYI get a food scale your estimated food weight will never be accurate.

1572,MeredithA.,"May 14, 2019",4,Overall great app! I‚Äôm using the premium version and for the most part love it. I think the detail tracking of macros and vitamins and minerals is fantastic. My only irritation is I‚Äôm also using UA Record. Although it‚Äôs properly updating my steps (linked through Apple Health) it‚Äôs not exporting my exercise from UA Record to MFP. I‚Äôm having to manually update my exercise to MFP despite recording my exercise on UAR from my iwatch.
1573,Gaming5,"January 13, 2020",5,Great weight loss app Great app truly helped me lose weight and it‚Äôs a great way to keep track of what your eating and helps you realize ‚Äúdang this food is way worse for me than I thought‚Äù i realized just how bad i was eating and it shows all the nutrition facts and it‚Äôs just amazing %100 the best food tracking/weight loss app out there

Another thing the barcode scanner used to work and now it NEVER works. I have scanned things for 3 days and gotten no return information. It‚Äôs awful, the app is garbage, and Under Armour has RUINED a great app."
1580,PvZsad,"March 26, 2018",3,"Okay but a little confusing I like the iPad version a little better than the phone version. It‚Äôs hard to navigate to some things, and using Fitbit in conjunction with this has been confusing. My numbers are weird - for instance the calories I‚Äôve burned are being taken away from my allotted calories for the day, so it looks like I have less calories available to eat for the day. What‚Äôs up with that?"
1581,Nickname is Taken II,"April 30, 2018",5,Very helpful tool Once I started using this I was accurately able to regulate my portion control. I was previously eating way more calories than I needed in a day and not exercising enough to burn them off. I just assumed I was but now using this app it‚Äôs easy to make sure I burn more than I eat. In the first week I lost 12 lbs. Great tool!

It‚Äôs really frustrating and I will do one thing and then it crashes and then I open it again and then it crashes and again and again and again. So yes I love this app but somethings going on right now with it.

1593,Kendrazombie,"September 26, 2017",1,"Ugh. It‚Äôs even worse now. I seriously love this app so much when it comes to everything except for the feed. I have always had issues, mostly since you put ads in every few posts. That is annoying as well but I understand you guys make money that way. However, it is extremely irritating to be scrolling through trying to like and comment on things and have it jump to a completely different area of my feed. When are you guys ever going to actually work on a fix for that?"
1594,Frumpy Frau,"October 5, 2017",4,"Very User-friendly I'm still pretty new to the app, but have found it to be really helpful. It is easy to search for foods, and makes a difference in how I eat over the course of a day. The nutrition feature is great for identifying things like where the calories come in over the day, and the breakdown of the nutrients. That helped me identify the fact that I need more protein."

1599,Tigerbaseball,"December 13, 2019",2,Lacking so much There is no easy way to enter your serving size. For example there was food I picked today the app says the serving size was 6.9oz but I had 5oz. I had to use a calculator to figure what percent 5 is of 6.9. What a pain. Plus you are stuck with the unit of measurement the app has.
1600,Amazin' Rally,"April 4, 2019",2,Needs More Fixing Seems like recently there are problems when something is fixed or I assume ‚Äúimproved‚Äù.  Most recently (Spring ‚Äò19) it is slow to respond and after two or three entries it freezes.  Necessitates going out and then back in at which point it closes and has to be reopened.  Then if you have more than two entries it freezes again.   I will continue for awhile longer in hopes that it is fixed.  If not then the hunt is on.

If I don‚Äôt track my exercise through a separate app and then log it in, I‚Äôll walk/jog 4 miles and the app says I only burned like 50 calories, which I know isn‚Äôt right. It‚Äôs pretty annoying."
1625,rlr524,"June 7, 2018",1,"Latest update messed so much up Updated June 2018 - Taking away another star and deleting. It‚Äôs very clear they do not care about user experience. Now a video ad for Starbucks pops up, at random times, takes over the screen and freezes the app. Amazing to still see app makers who don‚Äôt get basic UX."
1626,Ghostqueen13,"June 25, 2018",2,"An okay calorie tracker, but needs to sync with other apps At first the app worked perfectly, but now it only registers my Fitbit steps about half the time. Other apps sync well with my Fitbit, but despite me trying all the reccomended solutions, I still can‚Äôt get it to sync half the time, which really throws off my calorie counts, so I end up either overeating because I think I‚Äôll have more when it syncs, or way undereating and just staying hungry all day waiting for my steps to get added in."
1627,Dave$$$123,"April 20, 2020",2,Still very buggy! Program does not make it easy to share data between users. For example my wife and I have the same food for a meal. She enters the data for her meal and then sends the data to me via message to add to my diary. I click on ‚Äúadd food‚Äù and the meal but only part of the data transfers to my diary. So I have to manually re-enter the data. Sometimes you can actually see all of data initially show up in my diary only to then see some of it disappear.
1628,Javier rover,"February 27, 2020",1,It shouldn‚Äôt be hard to reset a password Look guys I love your app but every time you update it‚Äôs almost impossible to log back in and get my stuff. Your process does not work well with iPhone password savor and that‚Äôs a huge problem. Also it‚Äôs almost impossible to contact anyone. I‚Äôve used the app for years since it was free but I‚Äôve just spent about hour of trying to get back into my account I‚Äôm thinking you‚Äôre gonna loose me as a costumer.  Also you should add login using Apple I don‚Äôt like using Facebook as a login.
1629,Sdizzle 1981,"January 3, 2020",3,Used to be better I‚Äôve been using this app exclusively for 8+ years and over the last 12 months or so the search ability has declined. The app seems to only save previously entered foods for about 30 days rather than indefinitely like it used to. And recently many popular restaurant items don‚Äôt show up at all in the search so you have to waste time entering them from scratch.
1630,Mochi Wochi,"March 9, 2019",4,"It‚Äôs Okay One of the better fitness apps, but clocking exercise is difficult because they don‚Äôt count calories or even use a calculator so unless you know exactly what you‚Äôre burning it‚Äôs hard to enter.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a bug or if it‚Äôs on purpose but normally this is a helpful app. Why they don‚Äôt have better customer service is beyond me.  With he UnderArmour brand I would assume there would be live support.
1632,Original_Glitch,"April 28, 2019",3,"Okay but annoying This is a good app for tracking calories. But the ads are taking over the screen, the ‚Äúreminders‚Äù to try premium frequent and annoying and free features have been reduced. It isn‚Äôt worth $10/month. There are also annoying things within the app itself. For instance, you can create a meal from a recipe. But once created you can‚Äôt go back in and edit it."
1633,trshumway,"May 5, 2019",5,"Awareness I love this app! It has helped me to be more of when I eat. What I eat, and why I am eating.

Losing weight has never been so easy and awoken my awareness of my eating patterns."
1634,ABGoGo,"May 9, 2019",5,"Tracking made easy I was hesitant to try this, but the huge database of foods makes it so easy. If I am short of time I just find something close and enter it.

The biggest downside I have found however, is that my phone battery gets eaten up by the second when I‚Äôm using it! My battery life goes down about 10 percent a minute when I‚Äôm searching for ingredients! For this reason, I try to minimize my use, and might try to switch to a different app! I hope this is just a glitch that can be fixed."

1658,Rickie archer,"March 4, 2018",1,"Free I‚Äôve been a member since 2012. This app was incredible and helped me lose 100 pounds, but with all the updates I stopped using it. I hate the blog that has common sense knowledge on it I can find anywhere else. Ads are insane and I don‚Äôt like the challenges. Ever since under armor partnered with them or bought them it‚Äôs been going down hill. I‚Äôve also started fasting diets and MFP isn‚Äôt compatible with fasting...at all. Which is disappointing because research has shown fasting helps achieve better long term weight loss than calorie restrictions."

The price for premium (to get rid of the ads) is RIDICULOUS. The food search feature is not user friendly. For the price that is charged for premium, the developers could polish this app and make it what it should be. It is bland and not fun or easy to use.

I recently went back to my fitness pal and was instantly annoyed with ads and a questionnaire that wanted to track what I like in order to provide better ads and the worst part was my only two options for answers were ‚ÄúI accept‚Äù or ‚Äúremind me later‚Äù. I can‚Äôt even choose ‚Äúno‚Äù so therefore I know that I‚Äôll just continue to get the pop up questionnaire on the app until I accept.

The fitness pal app does not have the feature for net carbs (total carbohydrates minus total fiber), only total carbs. Therefore, it‚Äôs not exactly streamlined for those who have certain dietary needs, such as those eating a ketogenic diet. Otherwise, the app has pretty great features and is a useful health and fitness app."

The micro nutrient pie chart and nutrient breakdown list don't make sense most the time but If you have some foundational knowledge the app can tell you the calories you eat, gram, sugar, fat, colesterol and other nutrients u have eaten to keep u in check. It'll help you to reach your goals but don't expect it to be perfect."
1722,wannabefabfifty,"February 28, 2018",5,Accountability So helpful in keeping track of what I‚Äôm eating and how much.

I'm just using the free app. I really dislike how the app gives feedback on my food choices like ""this food is high in saturated fat."" I would be ok with it if all the feedback was the same color, like blue, but instead the feedback is color coded. Green for the food the app seems ""good"" and red for ""bad"" choices. However, the app and I disagree about what a ""bad"" food is and it really bothers me."

1733,Jess5860865,"December 23, 2017",3,Ok Overall the app is good. I gave it three stars based off the fact that without paying for the upgrade it really does not allow you to do enough. Also the price is outrageous if you do pay $10 a month and third there is a a lot of useless content. If the app allowed more stuff to be free or was less expensive and was a little more just simple I would have given it 5 stars.

When I try to add a recipe where the ingredients are added manually it lets me type only one letter at a time.  Takes forever.  And using barcode?

1739,Rolniak,"January 20, 2018",2,Dam good I had been using another app that track my food consumption and it is good. However almost every time I use it it turns it self off losing everything I was about to enter. Seconds later I log back on and quickly add my food. Very frustrating especially if you‚Äôre searching for foods. I thought it was because the app needed updating but I am running the most recent version. This has been happening for months. Please fix it!
1740,7outkast7,"September 7, 2017",3,"Edit individual items in scanned goods I really like this app so far. The one thing that I wish it had was the capability of after you scan say a premixed packaged store salad, that you could go in and edit the ingredients. So like if you didn't eat the cheese you go edit the scanned item and uncheck the cheese so it doesn't count against my daily intake. Don't know if this is possible but fingers crossed this would be a great help."

It doesn't always work consistently though."

1766,Tracms,"July 2, 2018",3,"Good So up too today the app was great, but now it doesn‚Äôt properly track steps!!! I have an Apple Watch series 3 which comes with activity tracker. However not able to track foods. So I chose to keep myfitnesspal for this reason! There‚Äôs a 450 step difference which then doesn‚Äôt properly account for calories in and out! I‚Äôd like to see if there‚Äôs a fix for this or do I need to go with a different app?!?!"
1767,AndreaBeeee,"July 12, 2018",2,"Too Laggy For the last month, the app continues to be super laggy. It‚Äôs really annoying when I‚Äôm trying to input my food for the day. Something that would take a couple minutes ends up taking much longer because it just constantly lags, crashes, or freezes. I end up having the close the app several times just to log in my food. It‚Äôs frustrating and annoying. I‚Äôm considering switching to a different app."
1768,Efaithmus,"November 6, 2018",1,"Stopped working and wiped data I loved this app and used it for years but this past month it started to glitch until yesterday when it stopped recognizing the login completely. I had to change my password twice. Then, once back in, it deleted all my saved data. Years of logging is just gone. Recipes I put in manually over the years - gone. It‚Äôs just not worth it to do all that again for an app you can‚Äôt count on. Might as well start over with something reliable."
1769,Rose192337472,"November 11, 2018",1,"Keeps crashing and logging me out This was my favorite app to track what I eat because I have been discovering that there‚Äôs a lot that I cannot eat but it‚Äôs also helped me track my weight loss. Lately every time I open the app the first time I put my login information in it tells me it‚Äôs wrong and prompts me to enter it in again, though sometimes it just crashes altogether. Then when I exit the app for even a second it logs me out and I have to go through the whole login process again."
1770,Diamonddiana52,"September 8, 2017",5,Love this App!!!! My personal trainer reintroduced me to this app and now it is my help in getting healthy physically with diet and exercise. I would recommend it to anyone who is too busy to record their food intake and exercise. This is a good app to use for the personal trainer and the family doctor. You will not regret getting this app!
1771,Suziegal,"September 26, 2017",5,Fantastic app I love this app. I was on weight watchers for a while and it was working but they changed their format and it was a bust!  I found my fitness pal and will never use anything else. I love that it provides me with detail info on nutrition. I wish that it would give me calories used for strength training.
1772,Demerittec,"November 12, 2017",4,"Great app but would like more flexibility The app itself is great for tracking food, recipes and work outs but tracking time is difficult. Since I work overnights at a hospital my ‚Äúday‚Äù doesn‚Äôt follow the conventional 12am-12pm and I eat that way. So my meals are inaccurately tracked for 2 separate days when it was just 1 day for me. If I could edit my ‚Äúday‚Äù this app would be perfect"
1773,Miss Salazar,"February 16, 2018",4,"It will do, for now This is a good tool to track what you eat, weight, progress photos, exercise, and calories burned. I wish there was an option for me to track my body measurements (arms, chest, thighs, etc) to track progress. This is helpful because sometimes the scale doesn‚Äôt move but inches are lost. Other than that I really like this app!"
1774,MiPhan27,"April 28, 2020",2,"Buggy The app is SO laggy. Everything else is great. I love using the app, but it can take so long just waiting for the app to unfreeze and let me press some buttons. It‚Äôll also freeze up if I accidentally swipe to the next or previous day. I have to wait at least 30 seconds, if not more, for the app to correctly function. But, even then, the app still has issues. Please fix. It‚Äôs been a running problem among many users for so long."

1777,Elaine - Age 63,"January 6, 2020",5,This is an awesome program! I was not successful with WW and their point system. Those foods that are zero value were a challenge for me.

Like I said no one is minding the store."

I just discovered that all the stats previously shown on the daily ‚Äúfood input page‚Äù (which includes the protein, sugars, sodium, etc.), now just shows the calorie count. I‚Äôve used this app since 2012, and just today realized those stats are missing. As a transplant recipient, I have very specific daily nutritional values to maintain.

I started immediately.  And I am being accountable for my calories I have been sticking to this. I am happy to see my weight going down
1800,kaydmic,"March 3, 2018",4,"Pretty good... Very easy to use. You do have to frequently check the accuracy of the options that come up in the data base, because anyone can add food and nutritional information. Calories are usually correct. But if you are watching other nutrients you have to be careful with option you choose to log."
1801,Guapie_Robie,"March 12, 2018",5,Before a personal trainer This app is one of the best apps ever. I feel this is what you need to not only take accountability but give you an idea of what you can clean up work on and fix before going out and getting a trainer. The kicker is I haven‚Äôt even start the paid version of the app yet.
1802,Add me: Peaches02,"March 22, 2018",5,Great App! I like this application. My only constructive critique is I would like to be able to export the notes along with the other data. 
1803,MissBoo49,"April 30, 2018",5,So far so good I am using this app on my iPad and my phone. It is so easy to track what I eat and stay on track. I especially like that I can snap a photo of most bar codes and that food is already in the database.

First, I want to be able to see Net Carbs (carbs minus fiber) in my dashboard at the top of Diary. Second, there is sometimes a toggle option at the top of this page to switch to Nutrition summary, and sometimes it disappears. I love that option! I want it always!"
1805,One new mom,"May 17, 2018",5,Great app This is a great app if you are interested in tracking your food and water intake. It counts your steps if you have it downloaded onto your phone and then take your phone with you when you walk. It uses the camera to scan bar codes on packages also.

Some of the new problems: I have to enter my name and password every time I open the app. The app constantly asks for access to Apple Health, which it already has, and then about half the time it fails to pull or push data with Apple Health. It also does not take Apple health workouts into account."

1818,Lucky in Louisville,"November 28, 2017",5,Best calorie tracker I simply love how the tracking keeps you accountable. The progress tab keeps you honest. If you have trouble even losing 5 lbs. this will help you. Lost 5 in first month and did not truly change my food. Just kept better track of what went into my body.

1823,AllieNash245,"March 23, 2020",1,"Slow I‚Äôve had this app for years and had no issues but recently its driving me crazy. Make sure you have ample time to enter your daily meals because there is a significant delay when you try to type anything. Also, you will experience lag when you try to click one thing so it will select something else (isn‚Äôt that the best...). Make sure you aren‚Äôt listening to music/podcasts while using the app because it will instantly mute whatever you are listening to."

It‚Äôs exactly what I need in order to track my macros, calories, workouts etc... but it‚Äôs the most glitchy app I‚Äôve ever had! It drives me nuts but I tolerate it cause I‚Äôve had so much diet success using this method.  It closes out of the app randomly, won‚Äôt let you use emojis randomly, chooses not to post things that you spent a long time writing... And ALL of my friends who use MFP say the same thing."

I accidentally hit one year instead of one month. I immediately emailed them about my mistake and heard nothing. Emailed twice more and still nothing. Worst part of it, i am not satisfied with the upgrade as it counts macros, but not dietary fiber. The point was to track carbs and it doesn‚Äôt do that correctly."

1867,Kmk5659,"January 12, 2020",1,Don‚Äôt waste your money of the paid version The main reason for purchasing the paid version is to not add in extra calories with exercise calories. The unfortunate part with the paid app is that it automatically reverts back to adding in extra calories without your knowledge. As a fitness competitor this is vitally important and this is really screwing up my progress. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how my coach continued to decrease my macros yet I couldn‚Äôt lose weight. I‚Äôm furious with this app. Weeks of progress wasted....such bs

The current update adds very aggressive auto play ads that launch when you are editing the diary page. I am incredibly disappointed with this development and will likely be moving on from MFP if the new normal is being interrupted by auto play ads while logging food.  Hopefully this change was done in error and will be corrected in short order.

1920,AshleyZ9,"January 8, 2019",2,"Offline mode??? I‚Äôve used this app off and on for four years and would normally give it 5 stars, but when I picked it back up recently, I can‚Äôt add any food through searching because it‚Äôs in ‚Äúoffline mode‚Äù! I‚Äôve tried on WiFi and data, and checked my settings to no avail. This is really frustrating because I can‚Äôt add a lot of the meat that is in my meals. I also can‚Äôt make the recipe shortcuts because it‚Äôs ‚Äúoffline‚Äù. Please fix!!!"
1921,Hates Incompetents,"January 9, 2019",2,"Unreliable The iPhone app is unreliable. I have lost the connection to their servers several times, could not log in or search for foods.

1922,sbhuffman,"February 23, 2019",5,Tracking App works great especially being able to use the scanner for your food. Honesty sometimes you think you‚Äôre eating good when your not. I‚Äôm tracking macros now and this is a perfect quick and easy tool to see how it‚Äôs going day to day.
1923,GlitterNacho,"April 10, 2019",5,Wonderful This app puts your life back in your hands by making a lot of decisions simpler. It‚Äôs super easy to use and once you build the habit requires no effort at all. Take control of your life again with this app and get ready to become the you you know you can be.
1924,honestcabbage,"April 25, 2019",4,"Good Overall great app that makes tracking calories and macros very straightforward. my only wish is they would add a place for body measurements along with the progress section. that way when you update weight and upload a photo you could also put in waist size, bicep size, etc. if you so choose."
1925,PonyGirl23,"April 29, 2019",5,What Is Going On!!!??? I‚Äôve used this app for years and it‚Äôs been a great tool for me but for some reason today it decided to stop working.

When I try to open the app, it shows it is going to work then bam, it‚Äôs gone. Closes down.  I hope you figure out what the problem is. I restarted my phone thinking that might fix it, but didn‚Äôt. My last option is to uninstall and reinstall. What a pain!!!  Actually my last option is to use a different app. If not fixed by end of today, I‚Äôll have to do that."
1928,Rbyer,"May 4, 2019",5,"Fantastic App I gave up on Weight Watchers (I am a 4time life timer) a few years ago because their program changed and I hated it.

1929,Tooks81,"May 5, 2019",4,"Great app Love this app. The only complaint i have is that you can‚Äôt update or edit a recipe you have created unless you recreate the entire thing, and you can‚Äôt share a recipe in it‚Äôs entirety, but rather you can only send via text the macros of the portion and then it doesn‚Äôt show the person what that portion size actually is."
1930,Yike Mike,"March 30, 2018",2,Just another money grubbing scam This app would be good to own but anytime I see someone with the premium I see someone who won‚Äôt be handling anything of mine with value.  If you use something as often as this app is meant to be used you should own it not rent the only reason I have the free version is these guys got there hooks into my fitness equipment provider.  These clowns can‚Äôt even spend the money to keep your personal data safe great I‚Äôll buy that!
1931,Noni9,"April 8, 2018",5,"Best app of it's kind I‚Äôve had this app for years. And I still feel this way, ‚ÄúCompared to other similar apps, this has the largest data base of foods and nutritional value and calories. Awesome!‚Äù But, I can say after doing lots of reasearch and finding fantastic recipes, I‚Äôm finally losing weight on a keto diet."
1932,L8-30s,"May 14, 2018",4,"Intuitive interface An easy to use application; though it could use some tweaking on the strength training calories burned calculation on the free version.

1933,Chrisnglenn,"May 29, 2018",3,"Not great for diabetics I do like the app, but what I don‚Äôt like is that as a diabetic, net carbs are what I need to track. This app does not allow that distinction. For example, I made donuts using a low carb mic. Total carbs is 10 grams per serving, but 8 of those are fiber, which does not impact my blood sugar. In addition, I am following a Keto diet, and it‚Äôs difficult to follow the macros. Not impossible, just difficult. Would be nice if those could be upgraded."
1934,Foolianne,"May 30, 2018",5,NET CARB counting PLEASE!! This app has helped me lose over 45 pounds but when I switched to Keto and went premium I am still stuck calculating my own net carbs.

1936,Marmaacc,"June 29, 2018",3,"Synchronization As much as I love this app, it never syncs to my Fitbit app anymore. I‚Äôve looked at the FAQs and forums but it just won‚Äôt take off the lost calories from my workouts and it won‚Äôt show my daily steps. It‚Äôs frustrating ‚Äúgoing over my caloric intake‚Äù but in reality I‚Äôm not because I worked out and burned calories. Just frustrating. I don‚Äôt use it as often as I would if it would sync up."
1937,saynotoPAreminders,"October 25, 2018",1,"Passive aggressive reminders. I can‚Äôt stand it. In a world it‚Äôs already so ugly I don‚Äôt need an app that talks to me in a sarcastic manner without humor to get me to use it. maybe that works for some...  If you wanna throw in some humor, I love to laugh. But to be straight up passive aggressive ‚Äúthese don‚Äôt seem to working ‚Äú no. I get enough of that from actual people. Be aggressive! Say, ‚ÄúHey! Come log calories before you forget!‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind aggressive. I mind backhanded aggression.  If they had a chance of working before - they don‚Äôt now.

1939,Foodie13,"November 5, 2018",2,This new update stinks!! Ever since I updated this app I haven‚Äôt been able to open or use it!! I thought when you updated something it was supposed to get rid of bugs not create new ones!! I use MyFitnessPal everyday and rely on it heavily to log in all my information...to be honest I‚Äôm quite upset and pretty disappointed in this!
1940,LH6386,"September 26, 2017",5,"Love it! The features this app offers are amazing! My favorites are the number of foods that they have nutritional info for, being able to scan bar codes to acquire nutrition info and what your calorie intake should be in order to lose the weight you desire. Excellent app!!"
1941,denfull,"October 12, 2017",3,"Has some bugs When searching a food and changing the amount from the default, the small screen reappears after you select it.  Sometimes takes two or three times to make it disappear.  Sometimes, when adding a food, the app will disappear and all you see is the home screen on the iPad.  Other than that a good app in general."
1942,Silkspin,"November 20, 2017",2,"It‚Äôs complicated What used to be a very good food tracking app is now a complicated mess. If I add my own foods I need to add everything about calories, fat servings per container, etc. "
1943,Myopinionmadders,"January 8, 2018",5,Fitness Tracking I use MyFitnessPal in conjunction with Garmin Connect.  I really like that the apps work together to show the training and nutrition.  MyFitnessPal also lets you search food and meal combinations for entering and tracking calories consumed.  It is very easy to use and has great functionality.
1944,**** **** **** ***,"January 8, 2018",5,First time user This app is amazing!!! It has led me to realize which food I should eat and when! It makes you feel great about working out and helps you choose how much food you should eat per day. This app has caused me to reach my goal weight in less than a month!
1945,Wazzely-wagglezy,"January 15, 2018",5,I luv it This app is just really useful to calculate how many calories I‚Äôve been consuming. And if anything it gives me more information on specific brands that I eat and which quantity. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre trying to keep track of your health!
1946,quantum_racer,"January 27, 2018",3,Myfitnesspal for tracking nutrition I track my exercise pretty closely and have been for a number of years.  Lately i have gone through a fundamental and profound change in my views on nutrition and decided it was time to track nutrition as closely as i do exercise.
1947,Jasontrip99,"January 30, 2018",5,"The Best! This app is intuitive and equal to the task even in the free version. I love it. I love the way you can log all your meals via the robust database, connect other apps (map my ride, map my run, Fitbit etc.) set achievable goals and map progress. I‚Äôve tried other apps and this one rose above the others."
1948,Fan of KK,"March 25, 2018",5,My fitness pal I love this app because it makes you look back and see what you actually ate for the day. It also helps you think before you put things in your mouth because you have to record it.. I also love the water tracking so helpful...üíïüå¥

1950,Tallngrateful,"April 21, 2020",4,One huge flaw in app for measuring net carbs For people who track macros and want to track net carbs it doesn‚Äôt exist in the app so if you‚Äôre doing any keto diet or tracking net carbs for your nutrition intake it‚Äôs not possible. You can only add a finer column in tracking foods and subtract yourself but this doesn‚Äôt add up in the reporting correctly in regards to percentages of macros for net carbs to fat to protein levels.
1951,Woofi,"March 12, 2020",5,"I love My Fitness Pal! I had used myfitnesspal a few years ago and lost around 35 pounds and when I got the notice that I had logged on 388 days I thought,‚ÄùIt‚Äôs either a lifestyle or an obsession!‚Äù After I quit my dog walking job, I gradually gained back about 20 pounds. I am aiming at losing about 5 pounds a month."
1952,FANFundertale,"March 11, 2020",3,Okay... This app hasn‚Äôt really helped me at all lose weight.  I‚Äôm still kinda heavy and I‚Äôve been using this app for three months.  It does track other things such as weight and exercise.  I wish that it helped me lose weight but I mean otherwise I get to track what I eat and how many calories I eat each day.  It makes it faster scanning the food so I‚Äôm happy about that. It‚Äôs okay.

I‚Äôve used MFP for nearly 7 years and in the past few months, have used it to track macros including measuring and weighing my food precisely. You can imagine how frustrating it is, then, to think I‚Äôve met my targets only to realize I‚Äôve overeaten because the app keeps adding my exercise calories back in, even though I‚Äôve manually disabled this feature numerous times. Please fix this!!"
1954,K. Wren Leigh,"January 26, 2020",4,Probably the best free app like it I don‚Äôt find the ads to be especially intrusive. Tracking is exceptionally easy with the barcode scan option. I have found that I get reminders to log meals even when I have logged them - a minor annoyance that should be easy for them to address in an update.
1955,Goldenfrizz155,"January 24, 2020",1,"Good app, terrible tech support I specifically downloaded this app for the ability to sync with my Fitbit app so I could get a more accurate calorie allotment. After trying every trouble shooting step I could find online, I‚Äôve still not been able to get it to acknowledge a step count or any recorded exercise. I emailed support a week ago and have gotten no response. There are plenty of other apps I can use if I can‚Äôt have the account linking capability anyway, so I may as well use one that doesn‚Äôt ignore me."
1956,Peter otN,"January 17, 2020",3,"Going downhill When I originally started using this, it was the fastest food diary at the time.  But since then it has gotten slower and slower. Things that used to take one or two taps, now take two or three.  Features that made it easier to use keep getting replaced with ones that make for a nice screenshot.  I won‚Äôt say that it is bad, just getting slowly worse."
1957,MikeW2k,"January 5, 2020",2,It‚Äôs ok For calorie tracking it works it‚Äôs trash when it comes to syncing your activities from other apps like Fitbit or garmin. I‚Äôve never gotten my steps from Fitbit to sync over. If I remove Fitbit from MFP and reads it will sync current steps but then never move after that and the next day it shows zero steps. Calorie adjustments can‚Äôt be made without this information. So whatever. I use this for my wellness incentive for work and nothing more.
1958,BarbaraMW,"September 27, 2019",5,"MyFitnessPal I‚Äôm trying out the Premium package and not sure it‚Äôs worth it. It would be helpful if I could manually enter the macros of a meal...since they are listed on a package from a vendor who preps meals. Also, there‚Äôs no mechanism for intermittent fasting. That would be helpful and more inclusive. So, this app isn‚Äôt meeting my Keto and IF requirements."
1959,MDva,"September 24, 2019",5,"Good app but daily totals are wrong I have this app on iPhone and iPad - and the daily goals, used and remaining totals are completely out of whack on the iPhone version.

1962,brian.mcgroarty,"May 12, 2019",2,"Paid version still shows ads There‚Äôs a lot to like about this app, but the paid option is deceptive. Paying is supposed to remove advertisements. But it still shows advertisements as notifications."
1963,Jake the egg,"May 18, 2019",4,Helpful app This app is helpful for food tracking. I used it several years ago and now there are many more food items. I am confused that the carb/fat/protein ratios are not very customizable. I like to see grams and when I change one the other two adjust way out of proportion. Still a good app for nutrition tracking.

1966,DaisyFire2,"August 15, 2019",4,Love this app but recent update seems buggy I can no longer search and find things I was once able to locate. For example Carba-nada pasta.

However, the app could be updated to reflect new nutritional label changes with Vitamins A and C, as these are becoming irrelevant micronutrients on labels as most Americans get more than adequate amounts of these in their diets. I‚Äôd like to see more emphasis on vitamin D, which people generally don‚Äôt get enough of, especially in winter."
2084,MikeCoon,"October 29, 2017",5,"Almost there I have been a loyal subscriber to MyFitnessPal for the last three years. However, I recently went on a keto diet and it is horrible at adjusting the macro view for a keto diet. MyFitnessPal needs to add a net carb option to track in the macro tracker for 10 dollars a month it shouldn‚Äôt be that big of a task."
2085,Stonerdt,"March 31, 2020",5,Basic but helpful I use this to track calories and exercise so I won‚Äôt overeat and for that it is helpful.

Please improve!!!!"

It either doesn‚Äôt want to log you in or the app freezes on you. The website version isn‚Äôt any better - majority of the time food/exercise logs aren‚Äôt saved or they save multiple times so you have multiple entries. I paid to be a premium member and they should really start looking into reimbursing people for all this waisted time.
2091,jekon2,"December 10, 2019",1,Annoying things about premium As a long time loyal user and a  paid premium Subscriber I am extremely annoyed with the fact that I have to deal with an intrusive optin message (letsFace it it really is an ad)  about the location services setting every time I open the app.  Please add a selection that says NO instead of ‚Äúremind me later‚Äù.   Or make Remind me later to Mean maybe once a month not every freakin day. 
2092,Drwilmot,"November 16, 2019",4,Great tracking app overall Intuitive and complete tracking app.  Love the search feature which brings in nutrition data.

2112,Laxdog094,"April 5, 2018",2,"Food tracker Fairly easy to use, pop ups are annoying, yet I don‚Äôt like the app enough to pay for premium.  The biggest issue is that if I log my workout, it nets the calories burned against those eaten.  I know for a fact that this is not how the human body works, especially for a 55 year old woman.  There does not seem to be a way to shut this feature off- so I don‚Äôt log my workouts.  I‚Äôm going to look for another App."

Look to the Fitbit app for a good example of the mechanism to choose serving sizes."

Keeling yourself accountable is so crucial and truly helps you make better decisions throughout the day. We all have ‚Äúfree meals‚Äù or ‚Äúcheat days‚Äù as we should, and this helps show you, that you can still enjoy yourself while taking care of yourself :-)!"
2166,jepask,"February 17, 2018",3,"Helpful, but needs to be more accurate I like that it keeps me accountable and realistic about what I‚Äôm eating. But it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating how inaccurate many of the entities are. The ‚Äúapproved‚Äù entries are often the worst. What kind of metric is ‚Äúone whole pepper‚Äù as a serving? And, when I crosscheck nutritional data of, say, a 4 oz chicken breast, most of MyFitnessPal‚Äôs options are often 50-75 calories different!"
2167,Jaboom_C3,"March 9, 2018",3,"Used to be excellent. Now it crashes all the time I used to love this app. Then suddenly it started crashing all the time. I stopped watching my calories because I couldn‚Äôt track them. I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt losing any weight tho and tried it again, looking for an update, but there is none. And it still crashes. Nothing has changed"
2168,Ashlee08,"March 23, 2018",5,Love this app! It has become my everyday app. It‚Äôs so easy to log meals quickly and scan barcodes. I‚Äôve lost 12 pounds so far and I‚Äôm excited to keep going. My husband has even started doing it to. He wants to keep track of his macros. I can‚Äôt believe this app is free!
2169,Kaykay0606,"March 26, 2018",5,"I absolutely love this app! I‚Äôm a couch potato, but I‚Äôve decided to change my lifestyle. This app has been incredibly helpful in teaching me to pick healthier meals and snacks. I love the fitness articles and recipes. I can‚Äôt say enough about this app. I‚Äôve recommended it to all my family and friends."
2170,yokunaikoto,"September 14, 2017",2,"Good because of the list of foods This app has a huge list of foods with their calorie content. It's fairly searchable, but they force you to look at ads every time you launch it, even though most people won't read them and would just like to put their calories in and see how many they have left. Even their 3D Touch actions are broken because they don't want to let you skip the ads."
2171,Denia**,"September 18, 2017",5,Great app! This is one of the only apps that has almost all of the foods I eat already loaded into its system. This makes the app incredibly user-friendly. Which is very helpful in our busy lives. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.
2172,Br$-Lhasa,"September 19, 2017",5,"Love it! This app has made dieting so convenient!  You can search any food you want, or even better scan them in with a barcode.  You can store recipes which is super helpful if you meal prep like me.  Highly recommend!  Great for fitness tracking too!"
2173,nauanabrodie,"April 18, 2020",3,It‚Äôs great but... It‚Äôs a great app and I haven‚Äôt even been using it that long but it keeps shortchanging me on my steps. I have an iPhone and I connected it to the health app so it can share data. It‚Äôs off by over 100 steps. Because of this it makes the calorie counting less accurate and it makes you think you didn‚Äôt reach your steps goal. Other than that it‚Äôs great.
2174,MissJaye99,"March 27, 2020",5,The best I‚Äôve used this app off and on since I believe 2010. Every time I need to get back on track I use it. I literally don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever lost weight without the help of me. Counting calories is what works for best for me and myfitnesspal is the best calorie counter out there
2175,Andywmm9,"January 13, 2020",4,"Works great Works great, but I wish it would integrate with Apple health more.   For example, I log workouts on my Apple Watch.  These should automatically show up as exercise in the app, but instead I have to manually add them there.  In addition, it should use my weight I log in Apple health so it isn‚Äôt in two places."
2176,travelfitfoodie,"January 12, 2020",5,Easy to use The app is easy to use and has many of the foods I eat already programmed in. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that once you put in a recipe you can‚Äôt edit or make changes to it.  I hope they will consider changing that.
2177,Reader1973,"January 5, 2020",3,"Figure out how to show net carbs please! I paid for the premium version and very disappointed that it doesn‚Äôt calculate net carbs. All the data is there, it‚Äôs just a simple calculator - why force us to make a separate spreadsheet?  üòí Also, it would be great if you could share a recipe with friends so my husband and I don‚Äôt both have to enter all the ingredients for a recipe."
2178,Britt Rivera,"December 19, 2019",3,"Whats going on?! Usually I love this app and I give it 5 stars, But what is going on these past few weeks!?! The app keeps freezing horribly all of a sudden, its not my service, after i put in my calories it will not update my total daily intake or remaining or anything, then sometimes when i got to my diary its blank!?! Also when i type it lags horribly"
2179,Inletta,"November 4, 2019",5,"Great App User Friendly I just started using My Fitness Pal and it‚Äôs great. It is easy to track foods and accumulates steps independently. I think that there‚Äôs more that I can get from this app, but as a beginner, I find it much better than others I have tried. It‚Äôs working."
2180,The McNicols,"April 16, 2019",5,Great app - easy to use I have been using the app for 2.5 months now and I have lost 28 lbs already.   The app is very user friendly and easy to use.  I have not found a food that was not already listed in the app database. 
2181,1976449028,"April 29, 2019",2,"Stopped working I was using the app with no issues for about a week then today the app wouldn‚Äôt load to open. I even deleted it and re downloaded, it still wouldn‚Äôt open. I then got it to open logging in with Facebook but it ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find‚Äù any of the foods I searched for. Needless to say, it got deleted for good and I am now using MyNetDiary which I am really pleased with so far! Will not be downloading my fitness pal ever again."
2182,Dee-Dee 0522,"May 3, 2019",5,"Best App Ever I love love love My fitness pal!!!! I started out just using the app when starting Keto to track my macros, but using the app makes me more conscious of what I put in my mouth. I started out using the free version and upgraded to Premium because the health benefits are worth every penny of the annual fee."
2183,GESB,"May 15, 2019",4,"Very helpful I‚Äôm a lifetime Weight Watchers member, but have switched to this because I‚Äôm tired of being punished for what I might do. This app allows me to see exactly what I‚Äôm eating. And balance it daily with my exercise. "
2184,TxBlackGold,"May 27, 2019",3,"Great app, but super annoying as if the last update. Love and have loved this app for the last 5+ years.  It has aided in my losing over 60 lbs, but now the last several days I have used it, there are, without warning, loud audible ads that play randomly.  There are good tools with the purchase of a subscription, but be warned..... Free use is now tarnished with these invasions of audio."
2185,Oberones,"May 29, 2019",3,"Used to be my favorite fitness tracking app This app used to be my goto for tracking meals and exercise, but this newest version is garbage. I spent the last 15 minutes trying to create a custom recipe, but the app kept crashing and losing all my work. I‚Äôm on an iPhone X with the latest updates, so I doubt it has anything to do with my device. Very frustrating."
2186,4lovez,"September 23, 2019",5,"Best App to keep you honest! Throughout the year of off and on dieting finally an app that keeps me honest and alert to each bite I take!  Everyone says ‚Äúcheat days are what is looked forward to‚Äù but for me, it‚Äôs great to know just how far is too far on cheat days. I absolutely live by this app!"

2188,tundramouse,"August 12, 2019",3,Second go around with this app I purchased the premier option about 1.5 yrs ago and didn‚Äôt have any issues at all. I really liked this app. I repurchased the premier option in oct 2018 and the app didn‚Äôt update. I tried to purchase it again but it wouldn‚Äôt let me and I don‚Äôt have the premier options. It is very disappointing as I am used to using the premier upgrade.
2189,Cortwynn,"June 12, 2019",5,"Love this!!! Losing weight and staying healthy is so simple with this awesome app!! I love all the different elements.

2190,Gamesman990,"November 5, 2018",2,"Cannot connect to server I had just downloaded the app a couple hours earlier and was very excited to use it to track my nutrition. A few hours later, the app logs me out and when I try to log in there‚Äôs an error message that appears and I cannot connect to server. I reset my password twice and still no luck. I re-download the app and restart my phone and still nothing. Not a great first impression."
2191,JTsubi,"November 5, 2018",2,"Forgot password Why would this app log me out ever. And the I reset my password and I can‚Äôt log in via the app. I can, however, log in on my pc. I don‚Äôt understand how apps would be less reliable than a website. And why would an app ever log you out when you have set up and use the fingerprint scanner to conveniently log in? Maybe just an iPhone problem. I will look for another more stable app."
2192,dhslagle,"December 1, 2018",4,"Good app This is a good app, I like being able to make my own meal times since I rotate shifts. Food search is excellent with good and accurate choices. I would love to see a way to delete old foods and exercises, even to limit foods to 50 or 100 as some other apps do. That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5."
2193,Sandi1212,"December 3, 2018",1,"Export feature doesn‚Äôt work For over one month, I have been emailing support to get this feature fixed. I paid for premium, because of the export feature and it doesn‚Äôt work. So basically I paid for a whole month premium and did not get what I paid for and can‚Äôt get any support or refund.  The only thing I have received, is several emails saying that they will look into it, promise me a fix, and then I never hear back from them again"
2194,Jess LR,"January 8, 2019",1,"Loved it, until... I have really loved this app, so last night I decided to go for the Premium app. However, after I purchased it, I started getting all kinds of glitches and ‚Äúnetwork errors‚Äù. Everything else that needs WiFi works, so I know it‚Äôs not my connection. I am unable to search for foods I have eaten to log them. Very disappointing, and I would love for this to be corrected so I can give the app 5 stars! I really enjoyed using the app before these glitches started."
2195,MichinAlien,"February 12, 2019",3,"Constant Struggle Connecting Fitbit I keep having to go through sessions of disconnecting and reconnecting my account with Fitbit repeatedly every week, because MyFitnessPal doesn‚Äôt sync properly. I‚Äôm tired of this and would rather use a different app at this point. Otherwise, this app is awesome. Great database for food and exercise tracking. Truly a shame that I need to try something else."
2196,Sister Seastar,"March 7, 2019",2,New update makes it slow and lag There must‚Äôve been a recent automatic update. The interface looks different which is fine. But the entire app is so slow now. It lags when I type or search making it very frustrating to use. Also the auto web import for new recipes hasn‚Äôt been working. It always shows an error and I‚Äôve been resorting to manual import of recipe ingredients.
2197,Tiff3690,"March 25, 2019",3,"Love it, BUT... I have been using this app for about 6 years and I honestly love it. I‚Äôve lost weight using it and it has helped me track my food to stay on target for a while. BUT, recently it has been freezing and crashing a lot. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on but it‚Äôs making me look for other apps that are similar so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it. Fix it please!!!!"
2198,a123435,"March 26, 2019",2,Syncing problems I consistently wonder why I pay for the subscription when I‚Äôm constantly having a syncing problem. My Fitbit steps and exercises never link. When I try to add a recipe I 3/5 times get an error saying it saved locally but can‚Äôt sync at this time. It‚Äôs incredibly annoying and frustrating. If I hadn‚Äôt paid for the subscription I‚Äôd probably just use Fitbit. 
2199,Birdm2fr,"April 8, 2019",4,"Great but... It is a great app but the weekly digest (this shows your calories for the whole week), hasn‚Äôt worked for months. It‚Äôs really annoying because this is something I use often to see if I‚Äôm eating in track long term. Other than that, the app does everything you need it to."
2200,Lady Fitness Unchained,"January 7, 2018",4,"Satisfied The only thing I am not pleased about is that you have to enter EVERY food or drink item.

2201,Fabilove1314,"January 20, 2018",5,Love it I‚Äôve used this app a couple times after having kids and have been successful every time. It‚Äôs very tedious work in the beginning but it helps you to realize the amount you eat and the value of what you‚Äôre eating.
2202,Suzilouspring,"January 23, 2018",5,IPhone vs iPad Love the app but I wish it would work on IPad with the same features especially being able to search and add food items

SO I tried to delete my account and make a new one.. but of course I couldn‚Äôt cause it kept telling me my password was wrong. Then I tried changing the password but it still didn‚Äôt work.

I thought maybe it was because I downgraded from Premium, but even when I re-subscribed it wouldn‚Äôt let me do it. Every time I created a new food, it would overwrite the previous one.

2214,Rikayn,"December 9, 2017",5,"Success! Excellent app!!   You‚Äôll log your food intake which will cause one to think before eating empty calories.

2232,Staples Knoxville,"May 5, 2019",3,Review It would be easier to log calories if each dietary item was listed separately. Example: any Panera salad comes with specific items. I don‚Äôt get all of the items or build my own. It can be added generically but it would be easier if all the items were listed and I could choose. It‚Äôs like that for a lot of restaurants.

I‚Äôll have a friend request notification, then it will continue to say ‚ÄúRequest Failed‚Äù, if I go to add a friend, same thing. I‚Äôm even having issues looking at my profile now :/ Just a ‚ÄúTry Back Later‚Äù pop-up. I‚Äôm glad I refrained from joining Premium for now. It seems there are a ton of fixes that need to be made."
2246,meaghsss,"January 22, 2019",4,"Good app I love my fitness pal and the ability to easily and conveniently track my macros / calories. However, the weekly digest rarely ever works; sends you to a ‚Äúpage not found‚Äù link.

2247,AlesisG,"January 28, 2019",5,Exercise note search? I love this app! I‚Äôve used it for 2 years consistently. But it would be awesome if there was a way to search the exercise notes instead of having to go through each date.
2248,L'ittle LuLu,"February 27, 2019",1,"Mobile version not friendly It‚Äôs been a while since I used this app. I used to use it on my computer - the website version. I had to make a new account even though I used my correct log in. So my foods are all gone. Cannot seem to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù a food like a fresh orange that fits the limited parameters of food creation. I don‚Äôt see any access to common foods, like a list of foods in the system that have been created by all users. So I see no reason to keep this app."
2249,wandalizAB,"April 10, 2019",4,Why it freezes too much? I really enjoy using this app and I would give it five stars if only it didn‚Äôt freeze every time I use itüòñ drives me crazy how many times I have to close the app and reopen because it freezes.

2250,Suga Honey Ice T,"January 15, 2018",5,"Self-Accountability This app is great for those who have the will, desire and most of discipline to stay on track with calorie intake goals.

2251,AmberSingleton2222,"January 18, 2018",3,"Good, however.. The one big bug would be the fact that when adding foods into the system, I will continually attempt to add in the nutrition facts, simply for the app to erase everything... before I‚Äôve even finished putting in the rest of the information. It‚Äôs pretty aggravating how it tries to encourage to add the information, and then basically says, ‚Äújust kidding!‚Äù"
2252,P. Willi,"January 19, 2018",4,"User friendly I like this app because it's easy to use. I just wish I knew how much premium cost before starting the free trial.

I canceled my subscription and will likely just log my food through the Fitbit app.  They also make it more difficult to search a restaurant menu."
2260,linzlove!,"October 9, 2017",4,"Great app, restaurant calculations could improve It‚Äôs a great app to track your calories.

That then throws off my calorie intake for the day which is frustrating."

2267,zleister,"January 1, 2018",1,"Upgrade Nag Extremely difficult to navigate around all the premium upgrade and ad traps in this app. To the credit of the UX folks and developers, these obstacles are so well placed that it is extremely difficult to do much in the app without accidentally clicking them. It‚Äôs their right to put them in there, and for a free app/service we should expect to see SOME amount of them, but there are so many in this app that I feel like I need to find something else to use."
2268,Dwbrownsr,"January 6, 2018",3,Great app before Under Armour bought it I used this app to successfully lose weight in the past and was very disappointed when I went to use it now.

2269,CindysMini,"January 9, 2018",4,"Wonderful motivation! I find my fitness pal to be a wonderful way of journaling my food intake. It's so easy and so motivational.

2271,Ooonnnn,"April 28, 2020",4,Great app The app is great. I have the yearly membership and use this every day. My one problem with it and I do hope they fix this as that‚Äôs the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is- have a way of recording net carbs instead of total carbs with fiber and sugar alcohols. It‚Äôs not accurate for those trying to do keto or low carbs.

2281,PAMainiac,"May 29, 2019",4,"For keto dieters... This app is great for setting goals, tracking diet and activity and monitoring progress.

Also, there‚Äôs no way to correct or report errors when other people have already uploaded partial or incorrect nutrition facts for a food item.  I might go back to Carb Manager which let me do all of those things, but doesn‚Äôt look as fancy or curated.  It is just much easier for Keto."

2520,The best seriously,"January 3, 2018",3,It‚Äôs okay The free version of the app is okay. Some foods don‚Äôt pop up so it makes it difficult to enter even with the barcode. It‚Äôs also hard to find your macros for the day if they were in a more accessible spot instead of clicking on 2-3 different things before finding it that would be nice but overall it‚Äôs a good app.

2586,Good food girl,"February 6, 2018",4,Nutrition watcher The app is very user friendly. I only wish it would require all fields to be filled in when someone is creating a food that's not in data base. Some of us don't just watch calories but other nutritional facts as well. A lot of foods are calories only in the data base.
2587,Alexcxis,"February 6, 2018",5,"Easy to use and I see results! It has restaurant menus for easy food entry. Scan barcode makes my life easier. I like that it tells you when to weigh yourself, and shows you how many nutrients you got for the day."

I regularly encounter bugs like entries being duplicated 10-20 times when I enter them, recipes not saving, and copying meals ending up on a different date than I entered.

I‚Äôd almost consider going Premium to avoid the pop-ups that degrade the USA ability, but at $50 per year up front or $10 per month the price is ridiculous."

2618,Raevex,"May 5, 2019",4,Great Tracking App I love this app but gave it 4 out 5 stars. Why? It needs more polish and perhaps input from its users. I would like to see a better design around the concept of a recipe and a meal. Conceptually these are similar and should be able to switch from one to the other.
2619,1bignolefan,"May 11, 2019",5,Great tool for health and fitness Easily keep up with calories and macros.  Works with fitness trackers to motivate your exercise and diet plans.  Seeing the info from every meal and activity is the key for me.  So much better than similar apps I have tried!!

The app was completely free when I initially downloaded it YEARS ago.  I don't understand why they got greedy and I don't appreciate it.

2677,HasuBee,"April 13, 2019",4,"Increases awareness I love using this app as it increases my awareness of how much and what I eat. Journaling allows me to identify habits, good and bad, and how my body tolerates particular foods.  It‚Äôs easy to adjust macro goals.

2682,Marse1282,"April 16, 2018",3,Can‚Äôt log food by grams or units directly Can‚Äôt log food directly by unit must use a fraction or decimal to achieve specific consumption. I.e. 1 serving of peanut butter = 32g if you eat 10g you must go to calculator and divide 10/32 and then use the decimal to indicate consumption. Unnecessary flaw probably easy to correct. Significant enough for me to give three stars as someone who measures most of her food.

2689,Dont try to block Me,"October 12, 2018",2,"Great and annoying to use This app CONSTANTLY logs you out and erases your date. It‚Äôs not a matter of remembering your login and password or having you consistently logged in, it will force you to logout.

I have no current updates for my phone or app. I‚Äôve even turned on and off my phone and that didn‚Äôt fix anything. I was considering on buying the premium edition, but I won‚Äôt until his issue is fixed. The app is only valuable because of this food database."

2710,John M Keynes,"April 1, 2020",1,"Awful No significant updates other than bombarding the whole UI with ADS. Deceptive and sneaky manner in placing ADS right next to UI functionality. Deleting and going back with Lose It app. I originally switched from Lose it app when I first purchased an iPhone. Now, going back after years on this app. What a waste. Will not be purchasing anything Under Armor related either since this is when the app began to nose dive after their acquisition."

2713,........12345,"February 5, 2020",1,Dropped my rating because of search engine There were popular menu selection options older versions had. You typed in Chipotle and you got the whole menu where you could easily see and mutli-select your items. Now that feature is gone and it‚Äôs more tedious to find the right nutrition or what you type and search for is more difficult. Why not bring that option back?
2714,Too fat57,"February 3, 2020",5,Easy So convenient and the alerts to log food really helps me!! Plus being able to just click on a food in my history to add it is great!!  Also the huge list of brands is great!

2718,Bunny Von Tail,"October 29, 2019",1,Finally logged in and super disappointed. First i was Trying to login and they claimed they were emailing me my password reset but it took most of the day just to get that email.

Net carbs (carbs - fiber and sugar alcohols) is extremely important. This app is great but requires us to calculate net carbs on our own. And that‚Äôs a pain. Add the feature and allow us to have it as our chosen display should we choose this. Thanks!
2724,KrayLoN,"July 16, 2019",1,What did you break? Why does this app force me to readjust my goal and change my manually set nutrition/calorie goal values. I have it set manually for a reason! When I open the app it takes me to the goals wizard  and then it forces me to accept the goals using the wizard you setup which over rides the nutrition settings I manually set... this happens every day and several times throughout the day every time I open the app. Sooooooo annoying.
2725,rlpgg76,"July 3, 2019",5,"Love this app I really like this app, but I wish you would add more options to choose from when scanning bar codes. Some times the serving size is smaller for women than for men. For example 1stPhorm ‚ÄúIgnition ‚Äú for women is half of that for a man. Thanks!"
2726,Op Prime,"June 30, 2019",4,"Exercise I‚Äôm really enjoying watching my progress using fitness pal.

It only allows 2 entries: calories and steps. It doesn‚Äôt look at mileage. And weights is even less adaptable to lost peoples work out routines. Still if just concerned about steps and calorie intake it does the job.

Now it seems they made macronutrients a premium feature- and premium is $20 a month!

It gets frustrating when the app says it‚Äôs saving a recipe but then doesn‚Äôt. üôÉ To be able to log anything accurately I have to go online, which defeats the entire purpose of the app. I am trying to accurately log my macros every day but when I can‚Äôt log anything I make, its sort of difficult."

Only reason I rated a 3 instead of a 5 is that they want you to pay for the extra graphs/charts to increase knowledge of how to improve habits by choosing less fat/ carb foods.

I refuse to delete the app another time & reload it just to regain its connection that somehow overnight it lost. Not helpful if it's not pulling in the workouts that I track on Apple Watch. It will track them fine for a couple months then abruptly stop & the only remedy is to delete my fitness pal & re download & sign in. Moving on.

3585,MFPpro,"November 3, 2017",1,Good for Calories The site is good for calories. But other than that it's a very negative site in many ways. It is like Facebook in that people can be very mean and the site will censor you for arbitrary reasons - while allowing other to bully. Also the moderators are not very helpful in most cases and downright rude in many others.

Now I received a message and call alert that in February 2018 the ‚ÄúMy Fitness‚Äù app was breached and my info was on the black web!

3693,DetroitCity11,"March 2, 2019",2,"Great When It Works The app crashes too much which is very demotivating. Otherwise, when it works, it‚Äôs an effective way to manage your intake.

The first question it asks is if your goal is to lose weight and then asks how many pounds a week do you want to lose. That is not healthy. I do not care about my weight. I just wanted to track what I was eating in hopes to create better habits. I know some people do but then this should be called a dieting app.

They already cut a deal with Under armor to let them advertise to us then still took the features to a pay to play model. Was the best app on the market. WAS.....shopping around other apps to de if I can find those features they cut out like linking Fitbit to negate calories when exercising. Keep scrolling.
3902,MyselfMe2,"January 19, 2018",4,Free or not free I think this is well made and informational but every single screen asks me to upgrade. It‚Äôs supposed to be the free version. We all know you can pay more for more features. Just let things be.

3909,sammyruizz,"May 5, 2018",1,Be careful!!!!! (Especially teens) This app was helpful but I got very addicted to it. Suddenly I couldn‚Äôt eat out because i can‚Äôt log the exact thing from the restaurant and I wanted to know exactly how much calories were in everything. Before I knew it I was in the hospital.

It's a little harder to track Keto, but with a few tweaks and a little basic math, it's doable.

3929,Justinatracyrae,"September 27, 2017",1,Too glitchy. I've always used MFP to track calories. But as of today I've had to switch. Over the sat three days I've had no luck getting basic functions to work. I input my exercise and it just disappears- the counter randomly adds two of something instead of 1- and it just won't sync with MapMyWalk. I feel like this app was amazing until it got monetized.

When I try to log in I get; failed to login in, unable to find server. Which is strange because I‚Äôm still logged in to all my other apps. I have been trying all day to login without success. I have deleted my account."
3974,Binaryspiral,"December 31, 2018",3,Expensive. Yet another Subscription. $50 a year or $10 a month... wow. I‚Äôve used this app for a few days and yes it does it really well but others are out there with a lot less painful at the pocketbook. 
3975,pencils and ears,"January 9, 2019",1,"Not working I literally just upgraded to premium, and now the whole app isn‚Äôt working. It‚Äôs so incredibly frustrating to log and keep track. It‚Äôs been like this for a few days, and with the excessive number of poor reviews, you would think they would be working hard to fix it. Doesn‚Äôt look great to a paying customer."
3976,Mominim,"January 28, 2019",3,Doesn‚Äôt work well with Apple Watch I love everything about this app but it doesn‚Äôt record my exercise from my Apple Watch. My steps show up but don‚Äôt record on my calorie count   I wish there was a better sync between these devices
3977,andrewleeman,"April 2, 2019",5,Great App! Love the app for its intuitiveness and simplicity. One thing I would like to see in a future update is the ability to log weight for each set of an exercise.
3978,Jorene63,"April 10, 2019",2,Not happy I have used this app on and off for a couple years. The last two weeks the bugs are nuts. What is the point of tracking calorie intact when the diary doesn‚Äôt work. I have to wait until the end of the day to track. Here‚Äôs hoping you get the bugs worked out.
3979,jenfabulous,"April 29, 2019",1,"App crashes constantly! After cancelling my premium subscription months ago, the app now crashes at least once every time I open it. Just did the newest update today and now the app tries to load and then crashes and fully closes. If my trainer didn‚Äôt require me to track macros I would not use this app again. Waste of time and effort!"
3980,Vanilla Fuma ^////^,"April 1, 2018",1,"Won‚Äôt calculate steps/calories burned properly Was working fine until two days ago. It shows my steps (from iPhone), but doesn‚Äôt calcute calories burned. Yesterday, I logged over 10,000 steps and inly got crddit for 8 calories burned (for 522 steps). It showed the 10,000 steps on the home page, but something different in diary. Doing the same thing today. So frustrating."
3981,Luvnjen,"April 23, 2018",4,Great food tracker It is great for food tracking especially the scanning options however wish it could link directly to iWatch for true calorie count. But overall is helping keep an awesome food diary.

3985,flybygrl,"May 16, 2018",4,"Great app, one hiccup The app works great with the exception of uploading recipes from the web. Sometimes it work but many times I get an error so I have to manually enter the ingredients. Luckily, a copy and paste works well for this."

BUT, it goes offline all the time and won‚Äôt search or sync. This is a big problem, and one that is known by the developers. It must be fixed! Meantime, use the website..."
3991,Amhsturn,"January 5, 2018",3,Adding recipes I am having a hard time adding recipes. The app keeps closing the keyboard after each letter I type when I type the ingredients manually. Very annoying. I am trying to get into a better habit of using it and this doesn‚Äôt help.
3992,PSRcmg,"January 10, 2018",3,"Disappointed I‚Äôve had the app for many years and it will no longer connect to the server, so the app is largely useless.  I can use the FitBit app to do the same things this does without needing to enter everything twice.   I‚Äôm unclear as to what changed."
3993,SumSkybaby,"January 16, 2018",4,"Know Your Numbers I‚Äôm using the free program to help me get my macros on par (as well as my calories) for a nutrition challenge I‚Äôm doing with my CrossFit.

3994,Aaron388,"January 21, 2018",4,"Love the app, but..... I've used FP for years, but since Underarmour version came out, it's slow loading. I also have to use a stylus to get a food entered. The arrow is not sensitive enough. This app is the only time I ever have to use a stylus on my ipad?!?!"

4001,The Kane's,"October 20, 2017",5,Best way to track your food. Love this app because it offers so many features for free app. I need to track my sodium now and it‚Äôs makes it perfect to manage it.
4002,Onthemark3,"November 1, 2017",5,Great App I LOVE LOVE this app. I have lost 2 pounds since I started. I have been doing Weight Watchers and had reached a plateau. This program has gotten me over the hump. Love knowing the nutritional value of foods. This has really helped me.
4003,Missdpinkyd,"November 15, 2017",1,Robbed me So i signed up for the free trial. I planned on canceling it on the 13th or 14th because it would charge me on the 16th. They debited my account early on the 14th. $50 and will not refund. I had until the 16th! I was truly enjoying this app but if i could give this app a zero i would now. 
4004,PG51799,"November 19, 2017",3,My fitness pal Great app. Does it better than I dreamed. I have a couple of problems with it. Seems to lock up too often and it doesn‚Äôt allow editing of the food lists. I have some incorrect entries and some old incorrect entries that get in my way.
4005,Asap jake,"December 5, 2017",5,Awesome app This app has been alot of help i can track everything i eat and i know when i meet my calories for the day. This app will fit to lifestyle and goal ! Love it
4006,SnappyBark,"December 15, 2017",5,Passport to a healthy me! Typing food into MyFitnessPal has made me aware of what I‚Äôm actually eating & allows me to budget my 1300 calories! Every food seems to be in its system ‚Äî including restaurant menus. Gratitude.
4007,Diabolical diabetic,"December 28, 2017",5,Good app I'm a type 1 diabetic and it is amazing to be able to calculate carbs from a recipe. Only complaint is all the ads and premium is high priced and in my opinion not worth what I need it for.

4017,Karenear 6384,"April 6, 2020",5,Wow This app has really made me be more aware of the calories that I take in I am just really getting started but already starting to lose weight
4018,Im Black man,"March 27, 2020",4,Calories Great app but you guys should go for all calories burned instead of just the calories during exercise especially if you‚Äôre using the information from a Apple Watch and Health app
4019,Westminlayfam,"March 6, 2020",4,Great accountability partner! This app has helped me cut out the snacks. It would be better if you could check mark food items from previous days to copy in bulk rather than one at a time.
4020,Gubiassco,"February 20, 2020",2,"Decimal added - why?? I see several people have the same problem I do with the recent update, the default for adding servings to the food diary is now BOTH fraction and decimal.  Why??  There seems to be a problem every single time MyFitnessPal does an update...always issues with this app.  Please fix this!"
4021,KiingxGuapo,"January 31, 2020",4,What I‚Äôm missing... This app is fantastic for all intensive purposes; I‚Äôm writing to say what I‚Äôd like to see in future updates:
4022,Jkl144,"January 4, 2020",1,Incorrect information When searching for a food such as ‚Äúboneless skinless chicken breast‚Äù tons of options come up with completely incorrect data. The only way to report is to fill in a huge data sheet- please have an option to remove blatantly wrong or empty food options. It‚Äôs not my responsible to fix incorrect options that are clogging up the entire app.
4023,kdownby,"December 27, 2019",1,Where did my recipes go?? I pay for the upgraded version. I used to be able to access recipes created by my nutrition couch. Now-they‚Äôre just gone. All the recipes & nutrition info she created for public use is unavailable. Your premium app isn‚Äôt cheap-please fix the issues. It‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing issues (most recent reviews are majority negative)
4024,mph6563,"December 10, 2019",1,"Thirsty af for my location On every single app launch, MyFitnessPal now displays a full-screen request for precise location data to serve ads. To dismiss it without giving permission you have to hit a tiny target hidden under the talk switch bar at the bottom of the screen, and confirm a modal dialog. Then it do it again the next time, and every time, you launch the app!"
4025,ekac2019,"September 30, 2019",5,Love it! Should have bought this app a long time ago!  Has helped 100% keeps me motivated and gives great tips while I continue to work on a healthier me.
4026,mepoooooio,"September 25, 2019",4,Great app I love this app.  I‚Äôve been doing great with logging meals and losing the few pounds I wanted. I just wish it was compatible with the Apple Watch.  My steps from my phone are less than the steps logged by my watch.  :-(
4027,lat3ralus65,"August 19, 2019",2,"Not great! The app itself is good enough, though cluttered with duplicate, incomplete or inaccurate foods. It handles the task of tabulating calories and macros.  Annoyingly, it tries to push premium service at you every chance it gets, which doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to me.  More annoyingly, with the current version of the app I have to log in EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app."
4028,savriva,"August 8, 2019",1,"Chill it on the premium pushing please They‚Äôve recently updated the app so that features that were once free are now premium. Also, the constant badgering to go premium is annoying and hinders my ability to quickly add food and move on about my day. That said, they‚Äôve got the largest database of food of any other app I‚Äôve tried so looks like I don‚Äôt have much choice."
4029,Rad scout,"July 19, 2019",4,Nutrients and macros I love the feature for macros and nutrients. But if this app could recommend food items that would contain the nutrients I seem to be deficient in- that would help
4030,Belovedperson,"May 14, 2019",5,Sooooooooo helpful !!!!!! Makes THE difference to me to have access to  your index of food !!! To be able to measure quantity helps w exactness. The encouragement notifications make it just personable enough !
4031,Liz Russell 2,"May 20, 2019",2,"Hard to improvise cooking This is a pretty good app, but it‚Äôs frustrating when basic foods aren‚Äôt available in the drop-down menu in predictable amounts. I improvise a lot in the kitchen with seasonal ingredients and inputting my own recipes makes me crazy. There should just be predictable non-branded data for all foods, in predictable amounts available in the database."

4034,Mrtedtyler,"June 5, 2019",5,"More than enough!! The free version of MFP is more than enough to track my meals. I have yet to enter an item that is not already in their database, that includes restaurant dishes! Excellent App!"
4035,Lnfthr,"July 12, 2019",1,"App always has technical problems Just about every day I have sync issues and various other technical issues/problems. The tech team will comment on their FAQ that issues have been resolved when in actuality they are not resolved. Do not purchase the premium version, definitely this app is not worth paying anything for."
4036,kylebenches,"June 24, 2019",1,"Bring back the day‚Äôs total for macros I love MyFitness Pal. Been using it for years, but why would you remove the day‚Äôs totals for macros at the bottom of the daily log.

I know I can do a little math or click through to find the totals, I just don‚Äôt understand why you removed it."
4037,Dragonfly1075,"June 24, 2019",3,"Frustrating A lot of times when I enter or update a recipe, it fails to sync. It takes long enough entering it the first time, so having to start over us a huge inconvenience. Since I‚Äôm paying for the full version I expect better."
4038,Swag3hunnaMill,"June 24, 2019",5,"All around great app Reliable, takes little time to get use to & the macros it tells you to follow are a good foundation to go off. "
4039,VAKirks,"June 17, 2019",5,Helps to stay focuses daily I do much better when I enter my calories. Even if i don‚Äôt hit my goal neither do I just eat blindly. A great app that is easy to use.
4040,hmcostin,"March 19, 2019",4,Workouts I love the app for tracking my food intake. The only thing I find I'd lacking is the workout options. I do beachbody workouts and would really like to see myfitness pal partner with them to track calories burned!
4041,Flustrated2011,"April 2, 2019",2,"Freeze and Crash I‚Äôve used this app for 8 years now and never had any issues until the past month.  The app freezes and crash so often, it takes multiple times just to add one food item.  Really would like to see an update to fix it."

4051,tenwork,"September 26, 2018",3,Current app frequently crashes This continues to be a great app for tracking food versus exercise and managing weight. However there is some bug within the current version of this app that frequently crashes on a iPhone X.

I can literally not even input simple breakfast foods (egg, 2 slices bacon, pepper jack cheese, croissant) - even from my saved list, without the app crashing. Same goes for scanning a barcode - it crashes all the time. SUPER FRUSTRATING!!!! Fix it and I‚Äôll be back, otherwise I won‚Äôt suggest this app to my friends, family, patients or athletes."
4053,Chipshot18,"October 8, 2018",3,App closes by itself repeatedly Good app for recording meal data very easy to use and excellent library. But since iOS v12 it repeatedly closes while entering info. If not fixed soon I will find a similar app
4054,Shilohwolf,"October 23, 2018",1,"Was awesome until the latest update You now have to get the premium version to view information you used to be able to get without it.

Today I must have hit one of the ads that scroll on the top and it pulled up naked women wanting to swap pictures with mostly naked pics on my screen - REALLY?!? Can you not have ads that look like porn?

Foods should be able to be added as favorites for easy location and editing. Meals should  have a place to select the amount of servings the recipe made before having to fractionalize it later.

And once I do that, it still does not record any additional steps.  If there is not a solution, going to have to replace this app with one that syncs."
