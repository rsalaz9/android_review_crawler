0,fmurphy92,"November 26, 2019",1,"Be careful and PAY ATTENTION The day one of my favorite bands put tickets on sale I tried to use the Eventbrite link for my local hometown show. It directed me to the wrong show 1 day later, and I made the mistake of not reading every detail and made the purchase with excitement. AS SOON AS I got the confirmation email I realized there was a glitch with the link that I clicked on bc the show was obviously not the show I was looking for, so I immediately tried to contact Eventbrite to explain my mistake. I still wanted 2 tickets, but I wanted them for the show that I originally clicked on. They emailed me back about 3 days later and basically said it wasn‚Äôt their problem and there is nothing that they would do to help me, but that I am more than welcome to sell them to someone else. Thanks a lot for that helpful response. I will try to avoid buying tickets from this company for the rest of my life now unless they are the only ones offering them. Terrible customer service, even when the mistake was on both of us. I should‚Äôve read the fine details, but they also shouldn‚Äôt have had a broken link. I tried the link several times after that to make sure I wasn‚Äôt crazy, and the same thing was replicated over and over. After they emailed me and told me there wasn‚Äôt anything they would do, I also emailed them back pleading my case and they didn‚Äôt even bother to respond again."
1,Mishel Mandujano,"January 13, 2020",3,"Great but needs improvement to facilitate usage. I really like the app, however I think it would be very useful if we could remove events we saw and are not interested on. For example, when scrolling down I see something I am not interested on I would like to swipe left or something and not ever see it again. Also, events that repeat every week are annoying. They are the first ones to show up and they are like surfing lessons or something and each week is the same thing. Even if I choose filters that do not apply to that they still show up. Finally, filters are not always helpful. I could select community and nothing will come up, but after searching on google events do show up and they are on eventbrite!! Maybe have people posting events answer more questions so the filters can be more accurate."
2,milehighlover,"October 5, 2019",2,"What‚Äôs the point of this app? I have tickets to two Eventbrite events but cannot see the tickets under this app. When I click on tickets they are not there and I am redirected to login to their website where I can see them but there is no way to get them to be on my app. What is the point of this app then if I still have to login to the website to see the tickets I bought? I signed up on the app with the same email and password. Also, thought it was weird that the app didn‚Äôt give me the option to sign in. I was only able to create an account or sign in with Facebook. Must be why I can‚Äôt see my tickets...the app is not linked to your already created profile through their website. Amateurs made this app as far as I can tell. So It looks like I have to buy through the app in order to see those tickets and vice versa. Makes no sense."
3,VoiceOver user,"May 6, 2017",1,"This app does not work for me as a blind person using VoiceOver I enter act with my iPhone using voice over, a screen reader built into every iPhone. When I navigate the main screen of this app, I see categories I can select, but attempting to select them brings up no corresponding events. The window which would list events doesn't even open, and the List box at the top of the app doesn't populate. When I navigate from the top of the screen down, I do not see hashtags I can select, but when I navigate from the bottom of the screen up, I do see hashtags."
4,makersmark8350,"May 31, 2019",1,"Logging in Good luck logging into the app to get the tickets you‚Äôve purchased.  There is no place to put a password after hitting login.  I already have an account with eventbrite but all it does is say ‚Äúthis email already exists‚Äù and it automatically sends an email to change my password.  Kind of hard to login anyway when there is no field to input a password.  Good job evenbrite I feel like I‚Äôm being punked.  It‚Äôs obvious they don‚Äôt care, if you read all the reviews about logging in all they say is contact customer support.  Not even the developers know how to login on their own app.  Horrible app and horrible customer service.  After contacting I still can‚Äôt login.  It‚Äôs sad that people use this and I‚Äôm assuming the rating on the App Store is purely employees trying to save themselves a job while they look for an employer and development team that doesn‚Äôt have their heads shoved you know where."
5,whfjfuisbs,"October 25, 2019",1,"So fricken annoying This would be a great app, if the login wasn‚Äôt impossible. If you go to settings, hit login and then put in your email address it doesn‚Äôt give you an option for password. The options are login with FB or get started. If you hit either of them they send you a reset option for your password, WTH!? You can login when you are registering for an event, BUT it doesn‚Äôt keep you logged in so you can‚Äôt tell what you‚Äôve registered for and what you haven‚Äôt. I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to log into the app. Guess I‚Äôll use the site from now on ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
6,Sincere S.,"October 23, 2016",4,"Event Bright Wether your trying to be a social elite or not, very hip to what's going on platform in the application out to-date ‚ùïSeriously it gives you inside scoop on events going on for the weekend,weekdays,popular, and you can also set the filter to your liking! Great application for this day and era. If you don't get out much and when do happen to get out, and your trying to find something to do or wanna make plans. But no clue or idea on what? I for one definitely recommend opening the app to see what's going on. You'll go from no plans to something fun and cost effective to do or even free! That's right F R E E ‚ùóÔ∏è So have fun people who've never tried out take this App users word for it !"
7,RV Winkle,"October 14, 2017",4,"Update:  Beware!!! Prior to today, the Eventbrite app settings did not have a toggle nor option to disable cellular use. What I find strange is that since my previous post, now, there is a cellular use toggle option.  I know my previous claim was not overlooked because the app did not list in the cellular section. And when I checked the general listing for apps, inside Eventbrite settings, there was no toggle, nor cellular option to disable. However, there was location option that I allowed Eventbrite to use my location when in use.  I am not sure if this was an app glitch or update, but problem was resolved. Therefore, I increased my rating from 1 to 4 stars."
8,Drew927,"November 20, 2019",2,"Can‚Äôt find events Had used app in the past. Didn‚Äôt have it on my new phone, so when a link wanted wanted to open it, I had to re-download it. Knew exact name and location and tried to find it, but would not work. Have had trouble with wi-fi giving location of internet service provider instead of my actual location, so when it asked for permission I clicked ‚Äúno‚Äù. There was a search window to enter location, but it wouldn‚Äôt work. At that point, rather than go to location services to give it permission, I just deleted it. Don‚Äôt give me the appearance that I have an option if I don‚Äôt! I‚Äôll use something else. Works fine when clicking on a link and it is already installed, but no good in trying to find events that you may be looking for."
9,dirtylooks22,"January 10, 2020",2,"Great product and terrible customer service if something goes wrong I like the eventbrite platform. It‚Äôs relatively easy to use and I‚Äôve met some cool people through it. I have run more than 10 events in the past and the first time I had an issue where customers of mine ran into trouble because of their UI for discount codes I ended up having to eat the fees. When I explained that it was an older audience and they thought that they were not going to be charged, they didn‚Äôt listen to my actual situation. They just followed their policy of not refunding fees."
10,2344t,"March 24, 2017",5,"Terrible search results So there is an event near me. I saw it on LinkedIn and the way you register is through Eventbrite. Due to the fact I saw this on the LinkedIn app, there was no option to go to Eventbrite app. I cant remember my password for Eventbrite, but I have the app so I'm already logged into my profile. I go to the app, copy and paste the title of the event, change the settings for ten miles, change the event to free (which the event is). The search brings up events that are not relevant to the the title of the event and shows me events on the other side of the state. "
11,veritia,"April 6, 2017",5,"Never had a problem I personally have never had an issue with the app, but I take that with a grain of salt, as all of the local events I attend are run by the same group and have been for over a decade (and thus are a trustworthy seller and always keep the same dates from year to year, which seem to be what the complaints in other reviews are for).  It is very handy to have my ticket digitally as I tend to lose paper, and everything transfers nicely whether I am using the website (way back before I found this app), or on the app itself."
12,Planckster,"May 5, 2017",3,"Too Much Data!! Eventbrite requires too much data input! I wanted to buy four tickets to an event. All event tickets were the same price. I entered my info (name, address, phone, email, credit card). "
13,Nochsr,"September 23, 2018",4,"Hardly a Glitch - Easy to Use IF... I‚Äôve used the Eventbrite app a few times now. Most of the time, I end up on the app because I‚Äôve followed a link directly from an advertised event, which goes to the Eventbrite webpage, and then I choose the ‚Äòopen in app‚Äô option."
14,Jmkeasler,"December 1, 2018",2,"Don‚Äôt get to choose seats on phone I bought tickets recently, using the app on my phone. They were for a school performance at a local theatre. I wasn‚Äôt asked about seating, so I assumed it was just first come first serve. After buying the first 2 tickets, i had other family decide they wanted to go. I bought a couple more- no problem I thought, except when I printed out the tickets I discovered they were assigned. And because I bought the last 2 at different times- they were all in different places. This was frustrating. When I checked in, they explained it was because I used my phone. For some reason when using your phone you aren‚Äôt shown seating choices. Therefore, I‚Äôve deleted the app."
15,Standardson,"December 6, 2018",1,"EventBrite SCAM ‚Äì Drake Halloween / birthday party performance at San Francisco city hall Completely got scammed by eventbrite‚Äôs false advertising. Drake was set to make an appearance and perform, however, Drake intentionally showed up and enjoy cocktails in the bottle service area. Not once did he even address the crowd or pick up the microphone."
16,John in PA,"February 26, 2019",2,"Email address management needed I now have five separate Eventbrite accounts that can‚Äôt be merged together. There is no option to add a secondary email addresses, so every time I got a ticket from someone else to a different email address, Eventbrite automatically created an account and locked the ticket to it. The ticket claims path has no option to login and claim with your actual account. Customers typically have more than one email address. I don‚Äôt subscribe to one canonical email. Fragmenting my data across different accounts makes the app pretty much useless for me. It‚Äôs more efficient to just search email. The FAQ claims such futuristic feature requests are under review, while other apps consider this standard practice."
17,juancho45,"March 18, 2019",1,"Scams I‚Äôm so sorry but you are promoting fake events and fake organizer don‚Äôt buy no tickets from this app. I bough few tickets for a techno event in Dallas. And I just found out yesterday that not only change the event dates, but I talk to the manager of the artist and I can show proof of it. The event was for the 30 of March and now "
18,chachy56,"January 4, 2020",4,"Where did my ticket go? I have used eventbrite multiple times with no hiccups and the process has been seamless. This time it has not been so. I bought tickets Saturday evening for a show on New Years 2019 and after entering my information (email, phone number, credit card information) I received no conformation email with my tickets attached nor did I receive my tickets in the Eventbrite app. Checking my banking app my card was charged. *Update* there was a typo in my email that their algorithm missed when filling out my email but after sitting on the phone like for a good amount of time the issue was resolved."
19,gkmvl,"July 19, 2019",1,"Contact support Horrible app/website! I am very upset! I had an issue with tickets of a event that was going to happen next month so I decided to contact the organizer to help resolve the questions I had. I emailed not once but twice ,through their website not only was there no trace of my emails but no where to see if they replied or not ! So I decided to go through customer support even worse I don‚Äôt get why they ask for all the information and details of what my issues were if it was going to be like I never sent an email. Not only did I not get an answer but there is not even a place to check if you even sent the email because it won‚Äôt show up anywhere. It will only say ‚Äúmessaged sent‚Äù after sending the email and nothing more."
20,Alpha3plus,"May 5, 2017",3,"Should be able to purchase without saving credit card info The first time I used this app, I could make a purchase without saving a credit card.  Now you must save a credit card to complete a purchase.  You have the option of removing a saved credit card in the desktop version but not from the app.  Even in the desktop version, the screen to remove a saved credit card is a couple of sub menus down.  Searching for ""remove saved credit card"" gives lots of hits, but the obvious page should be the first hit instead of much further down, mixed in with a hundred other pages."
21,Gdawg1101,"June 14, 2017",3,"More Options Please!!! Show how many people are attending events on this app. I love the meetup app specifically because it shows how many people are going to each event. I don't want to show up to an event, and there is a room with me and two other people. I love to network, which also helps in the learning process. "
22,Wyatt's Tech Corner,"October 8, 2018",3,Grouping old tickets with new So I‚Äôve never had a ticket issue with Eventbrite until now. Recently purchased some tickets to a local event and when I saved them to the Wallet app on my iPhone I couldn‚Äôt find them. After searching every single ticket I found them grouped with an unrelated even from another year. This makes no sense because now I have to either remember this or delete the tickets entirely and just print out the paper version. The point of digital tickets is that they or organized for you which I never had an problem with until now. Anyway I hope this gets fixed soon.
23,sjelms,"February 23, 2019",1,"Generally a horrible experience Eventbrite don‚Äôt understand that people are mobile. I‚Äôm forced to have three (3) accounts at the moment because from time to time I travel and book for things in the US, UK, or E.U.  Each requires a new account and new login despite the fact I‚Äôm the same person on the same device. Why is this such a challenge for them? "
24,Twistedesoterix,"March 24, 2019",5,From an investor So I have been reading reviews. Your forgot password is not fluid.  It should allow me to use my facebook even though I already have an account via eb.  Your event managers should have a reviews section!  I want you to succeed.  Stay away from
25,scaly_dragon,"April 5, 2019",3,"Stupid glitch please fix This happened a while ago and I‚Äôve not used the app in a while, but when I tried today, the same issue! I was following a link on a web search results and it did open the app and even flashed the ticket price, but before I get a chance to tap it to purchase tix it overrides the event page with ‚Äúwhere do you want to go?‚Äù when instead it should take me to the checkout. It doesn‚Äôt let me use the link to get directly to the event. So I have to find the same event AGAIN within the app using the search button. This is very annoying."
26,Ehn'Reil,"April 8, 2019",5,"ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ Reading the recent reviews have me a little worried. Fortunately the only issue I‚Äôve had is remembering the events I‚Äôve planned to attend or just over booking for different things. Outside of that I‚Äôve had no issues with the app really. Twice it had been running EXTREMELY slow, but I just had to close the app completely. After that it ran fine. I‚Äôm worried because I JUST updated the app and so hopefully I won‚Äôt experience any issues now lol. Yet and still I love it! ü•∞"
27,Jmamba7,"April 24, 2019",3,"Months of Not being able to login UPDATE 2: not working again. Wish i could provide screenshots etc. It worked for maybe a day. I was able to see tic etc and now there‚Äôs zeros all around. Logged out, redownloaded. Restarted phone. Nothing. #overit "
28,BonoboBaba,"March 5, 2020",1,"You‚Äôve been warned... This app is garbage. Trying to find & recover over $600 of tickets that seem to have vanished. Every link in the confirmation email takes you to the same place on the web, can‚Äôt access anything in the app. Trying to reset a password just results in the ‚ÄúLog In‚Äù banner @ the top of the app screen turning white, then dumping you back at the same broken login page. Good luck trying to contact your ‚ÄúEvent Organizer‚Äù too, guess what‚Äîyou have to log in for that. Round and round it goes. Guess that‚Äôs goodbye to a fun long weekend in Sonoma, since all my info is gone. Thanks for ruining that, guys. Before you download, do yourself a favor and ask ‚ÄúDo I really want to throw my money away in an app, or just pay at the door?‚Äù You decide...Caveat Emptor."
29,anonymous6824,"January 1, 2020",1,Stealing money Event Bright is the worst. They actually don‚Äôt verify if the individuals are real and they can actually steal everyone‚Äôs money. 
30,pinkhellokitty1981,"December 7, 2016",5,Love the app but would like to make a request I love Eventbrite and the app. It stores my info it's fast and until recently it could search venues and pull all shows  (I'd like that back) but there is one thing I'd like to see added. The wallet on iPhones should have an option to always add to calendar and to apple wallet. It should also automatically delete old shows from the wallet or store in a folder that's in the me tab on the app.
31,menzamusic,"May 3, 2017",3,"Worst. Ever. The app, the online site, the architecture, the design, the user interface(s) are all the worst.  I have been forced to use Eventbrite multiple times with a range of events from multiple sources.  I wind up cursing each and every time I deal with it.  It should one or two steps to accomplish what they so bravely profess to do.  Instead it's a ridiculous amount of steps and an opaque path to just get your tickets.  Whether it's on a desktop to printout or in my phone with their app.  It all should be seamless.  Super frustrating. Stupid design, worse implementation."
32,Red3000GTgirl,"August 11, 2017",5,"Upcoming purchased tix don't show but past ones do I bought tix to an event via the website and downloaded the app to be able to easily retrieve them. My upcoming event tix don't show under my Tickets in the app, however, past events tix are showing. Tried logging out of app & back in, same result. This year's upcoming tix do show on the website when I login so they are not lost. I don't see me using this app much since it doesn't appear to sync correctly."
33,DHosein1998,"August 20, 2017",1,"Missing Tickets I paid for a ticket (VIP Backstage Pass) to a Dave East/ PnB Rock concert, and received the confirmation email containing NO SAID TICKET! I open the EventBrite app and click on the ticket which it says I have... but there is no barcode to be scanned, and it says ""This organizer has disabled mobile tickets."" There is no option to print, and what makes it worse is that both of my friends who purchased the same ticket HAVE THE TICKET! They have the pdf version that is supposed to come in the email, and they have the app version than can be added to the apple wallet. If I miss this concert I will be extremely upset, and EventBrite better do something to fix this ASAP because the concert is TODAY!"
34,Bev1981,"August 9, 2018",4,Ver 5.2.6 Updated Review:  The newest version seems to be working as expected. I like the look and feel of the app.
35,julesdontapprove,"August 14, 2018",1,"Don‚Äôt recommend! Back in May I ordered tickets to an event and the event was cancelled last minute. I requested for an refund and waiting for a response 4-7 business days. There was no policy on refunds to the event I was going to.  I‚Äôve tried calling the company and they transferred me to sales, I was then left on HOLD for 3-5 hours every time !!! üò°üò° I hung up and called back again and again and I tried explaining to the guy but they ALWAYS transferred me and I was left on hold for hours! I‚Äôve tried calling every other day and it was the same process. My claim for my refund is still PENDING. It‚Äôs now three months later and haven‚Äôt heard a thing. NEVER, EVER buying tickets through Eventbrite EVER AGAIN!"
36,Neverleaveumom,"September 7, 2018",1,Unsafe conditions I went to the Festival of life on day 1 at Lincoln park in Newark and couldn‚Äôt find a parking spot and if I did luck up I would never have gotten in.  There were so many people in such a small park so I went home.  I tried again on day 2.  I found a parking spot and got in with no problem.  Not as many people.  The problem was them shooting T-shirts from that canon into the crowd of people.  One was coming my way and I was barreled into by a group of people and knocked into the elderly lady behind me.  My entire right side was hurt for 2 days.  I hope the other lady was ok.  Needless to say I never went back again.   Freebies are just not worth it even though I left empty handed.
37,Jecoreiography,"September 28, 2018",3,Issue I really enjoy using this app but there is a serious glitch with the application right now. You can access Eventbrite via the website online but if your trying to use the app it continues to close out. I‚Äôve been waiting a little over a month to see if any update would happen to fix the issue but it hasn‚Äôt. Again I love the Eventbrite and use it quite often but I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to go online in order to access all the features and I could just use that app that I downloaded for its purpose.
38,KatDenise80,"August 30, 2019",2,"Can‚Äôt log in This app would be wonderful if it allowed you to log in. When you have the option and press the log in button, it gives you the option of using an email address or logging in with Facebook. If I choose email, there is nowhere to enter in the password associated with my account. If I choose Facebook, I get a message stating that I cannot log in because an account already exists with the email address. I can go to the mobile browser version of Eventbrite and log into my account but there is no way to do it in the app. I have an iPhone 7 Plus with the most up to date iOS."
39,amfrank,"September 18, 2019",3,"Could Be Better I love event apps, but Eventbrite lacks some key functionality. I mainly spend time browsing in the search for new events and I think the app can be improved in the following ways:"
40,Supreme Intergalactic Private,"March 20, 2017",5,"Tickets to Everything I Care About! Eventbrite lets me know about things I want to go to BEFORE they happen, so I get the tickets/passes and attend instead of see the events that HAPPENED on the evening news and thinking, ""man, I'd of loved to go to that, if only I had known about it...."". Eventbrite has my interests plus I can search other events going on in town or nearby that I might want to see. It's opening up my life!!!"
41,Danny8909,"September 19, 2017",2,"Bring ApplePay Back I use to love this app and could not recommend it to various promoters in my city for their events enough. Its biggest selling point was that is had ApplePay built in and I could easily buy my event tickets without having to find my wallet and add a card. However, by removing ApplePay from it you have made it just as cumbersome to use as other apps. You removed one of its biggest selling points and what separated it from the rest. Specially considering how easy Apple makes it to integrate into the app using the developer kit it is baffling that it is no longer on here."
42,jegomez,"October 1, 2018",3,"Frequently useless Often has trouble getting to the internet, even when other apps are just fine."
43,Gwillikurz,"November 8, 2018",5,"Eventbrite makes all of your events  hassle free! If you‚Äôre looking for something to take the stress out of what should be a great time in your life, go with Eventbrite!

44,CareeC,"December 28, 2018",5,"Kid Stuff Looking for something free to do with the grandkids for New Years Eve.  Looks like I found a cool event on Google, and I used this Eventbrite App to get paperless tickets. It was easy, fast and painless, and my tickets showed up instantaneously once I logged in, no problem! I always screenshot tickets, just in case, but they are there! I am going to use the app now to look for a few things to do with them during the week!"
45,shirts2019,"January 11, 2019",2,Web and App I am a big fan of EventBrite. Congrats on your ipo too. 
46,CanukMD,"June 9, 2019",1,Waste of time This app makes purchasing tickets to local events a huge pain. They list events that have already happened in the past - why are these still listed. The only way to tell if an event is past is to click on the individual event and look at year listed. When you look at the list of events all that is displayed is the month and day - not the year. So for an event that occurs with some frequency you can have two listings for the same event in the same month - and you have to click on each one to look at the year to make sure you‚Äôre purchasing the correct ticket.
47,Jamel4785,"August 23, 2019",5,"Could scan it off your iPhone or Apple Watch Never had a problem. This is the technology right now. I don‚Äôt have to get up and go to the spot or place to get tickets. I‚Äôm technically saving money from transportation, even thou there‚Äôs a fee to purchase tickets on this. I could add it to my wallet on iPhone or Apple Watch and scan it from there and not worry about losing my ticket unless I lost my phone and watch"
48,Kingwvvvy,"June 13, 2019",5,I have an idea Not sure if this is legal but it would be wonderful if you guys could show us how many people have purchased a ticket prior to an even to I can decide if I want go or not. Not actual names but just a number count of people that got a ticket off Eventbrite. Beyond that it‚Äôs an amazing app. Especially if you‚Äôre not in the mood to send that ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the moves/plays‚Äù text to everyone.
49,Elly the Gold Digger,"August 2, 2019",1,"Most difficult apps to use I love this apps until I want to manage my tickets.  There‚Äôs no way to edit my order.   I need to delete the old tickets or the tickets that invalid because the events were canceled, and to change my order but no... I can‚Äôt find the edit option at all.  I even go to your help center and follow all your step just to find the ‚Äúedit‚Äù option but still mine doesn‚Äôt show it.  I thought I need to update the apps but mine is up to date.  All I can see were the options of share ticket and contact organizer.  What‚Äôs going on? Why are you making it impossible to edit?"
50,MBASAKüòé,"May 26, 2017",4,"SO FAR SO GOOD I have to be honest, I had a couple FREE events that I didn't make this past week. BUT... in my defense, I was notified of graduations at the very LAST MINUTE. So... I couldn't skip that. Other than that, I'm loving it! I have a few events to go to for FREE & my family are also allowed or can be included to attend then as well. I hope that there are MORE FREE EVENTS for FAMILIES. I think this is the neatest app to have if your one who constantly wants to go out, or get involved, learn, or just have fun!!! THANK YOU!!!üòç"
51,cforce22,"October 30, 2017",5,"It‚Äôs ok It‚Äôs a great way to have consumers sign up for events and to be able to share events. I like being able to connect this to my calendar and create FB events using this. Work that needs to happen: allow users to be able to cancel their registrations, allow administrators to update the seat and date within one session."
52,guacamole 33,"November 15, 2017",3,"Add better search controls please While I appreciate that you can change search functions by relevance, date, etc, if like to be able to default all my searches to ALWAYS be by date rather than have to change it every single time, in every single category. And I'd also like to see a search across all categories by date, rather than by relevance. Eventbrite doesn't know enough about me to have any clue what's relevant to me, & I'd rather decide myself what's relevant anyway."
53,brushka,"August 20, 2018",1,"Eventbrite wrong dates on tickets Generally it‚Äôs great to have a way of finding out most of what‚Äôs on near you through one portal, however Eventbrite loses points for lack of filters (there are very few categories, and it‚Äôs hard to narrow a search using keywords or locations), and even more points for consistently having the wrong dates on the actual tickets, almost causing me to miss several events.

After downloading the App and trying several times - and providing much more information than needed - my city, my location, my phone number, my email, multiple passwords- all too cumbersome and questionable need - possible identity theft and marketing information- privacy beach etc. Also need a nickname to provide feedback- why not anonymous or go to your P.R. people?"
55,Sue TK,"January 25, 2019",5,Quick and Easy Love this app! It‚Äôs quick and easy to get tickets for local events. Love that I can save them to my wallet seamlessly and not have to sift through all my emails to find my receipt/ticket.

There are tickets included in the email, but they are a badly formatted PDF and I don‚Äôt want to take paper tickets. There should be a button on the website that is linked in the email sent after you buy tickets."

My iphone, calendar, and Eventbrite apps have the most recent updates. Not sure what‚Äôs going on. Please fix.

The event was canceled due to weather. I submitted for a refund of just the ride not the entrance tickets. My refund was denied with ‚Äú.‚Äù being the only response listed for denial. While I understand Eventbrite is a third party host they need to hold accountability for who they allow to post on there site. When I went to complain to Eventbrite there is no easy way to contact them directly. They use a system of prompt questions which where not easily able to be distinguished for this issue.

I couldn't even select and past it in app. I had to open the event in the web browser do a select copy go to calendar and make a event. I would think being a event app a calendar add in to the calendar would been a shoe in. For now I'm going to stick with Meetup.

74,Ultra Man 7,"January 31, 2019",2,"It‚Äôs just web wrapper I‚Äôm not sure why the rating is so high for this app. The service is 5 Stars, but the app is barely 2 stars. The App is not much better than using their website on your phone. It does not use standard iOS navigation conventions like being able to swipe from the left to either go back or dismiss. Also, it does not use Apple Pay. Apple Pay is a win for everyone - the service provider doesn‚Äôt have the risk of storing CC #‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt have to worry about who has my CC #."
75,calgirl23,"February 17, 2019",1,Use this app to NOT know what events are happening One of the most useless and frustrating apps ever made. Impossible to search for events that I know are happening. The app has no way to follow or get updates for organizers I'm following. I have to use my browser for all Eventbrite events and only use the app to store tickets. I can only find out what events are happening by following organizers on Facebook or Instagram because this app does absolutely nothing to notify you in time for events. The app will tell you 2 months late to sign up for events. Ugh!

79,Lola Van≈∫ant,"June 16, 2019",4,Add more filters Eventbrite is my go to for finding things to do however the search process could be more intelligent.

80,Caliaska,"October 15, 2016",4,"So far, so good I haven't had a bad experience while using the app. I think it's great that you can search for any kind of event that's happening locally in your area or if you're traveling you can view events going on over there too and you can buy your tickets with so much ease. I have had a few concerns in the past which is why I gave this app four stars."

132,BrokenToeTom,"July 18, 2018",1,Cancelled our tickets Eventbrite cancelled our tickets the day before a four day festival and I have been informed by the vendor that it was due to a bug in their system.

""Explore"" is great, but sometimes people already know what they're looking for. I want more options to develop a feed myself. And more options to narrow my searches."

The E-mail from them encouraged me to download the app.  Thinking this would allow me to see/have my tickets electronically I downloaded the app.  BIG MISTAKE.  The initial interface options make no sense, after nearly 10 wasted minutes of playing around with the app I opted to use a printer which took <1 min"
336,gghali,"April 1, 2019",1,"Not designed for anyone with more than 1 email address! If you‚Äôre sent tickets from a friend or coworker and they send to an email address other than the one you have registered, you will have to create a new account. No way to combine tickets for social and work events. Total management nightmare and big miss in our modern digital world."

When I go back to list of events it gets me to the top of the list instead of remembering my place, I guess it happens only if you open more in the event details.

349,nohelp999,"August 7, 2019",1,"Where‚Äôs my ticketsü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bought tickets online to an event. Eventbright sent me a link to download the app. Download the app, registered, signed in and no tickets. Searched for 15 minutes and still no help, no tickets, horrible instructions. Went back to my email printed the tickets out the old fashion way and deleted the app. Get your stuff together please."
350,No Nickname Provided Yet,"April 14, 2017",3,Tries to do too much Helpful to have an app that lots of places use to distribute tickets.  Annoying in that Eventbrite is trying to be its own discovery app.  Wish they would focus on their core instead of trying to sell me stuff I don't want.
351,PunkinJson,"August 22, 2017",2,No posted refund policy in app So I googled an event to find where tickets were being sold. A link took me to an event with same name and unfortunately it was wrong one. App description did not show refund policy. If it had I would have taken a second look. Definitely learned lesson. Don't use app anymore .
352,RF Haymaker,"July 24, 2018",1,Updated & now my tix do not show up in app Bought tix to a show via Foxfire on my laptop & they showed up just fine in the Eventbrite app...until I updated it. Now they are nowhere to be found in the app. I can still print them out via the link in my e-mail but it is annoying that the app has completely purged my digital tix.
353,Fridarta,"October 16, 2018",5,"Love this app Eventbrite makes it very easy to find events, buy tickets and have them handy when needed. So easy to use!!"
354,atomicbird,"October 19, 2018",2,Just let me see my tickets It‚Äôs a good app for keeping mobile event tickets. Recent versions insist that you select a city so they can fill the app with useless junk about every event in the area. I don‚Äôt want that but I can‚Äôt see my tickets without it. This is a terrible change to a formerly good app.

359,Sarcastic wow,"September 6, 2019",1,Terrible app Already was invited and registered to an event through the app. Thought downloading it would speed up checking on event details. Attempting to access my event through the app however proved impossible. It stated I hadn‚Äôt registered yet (first thing I did). Would not let me see details which I could within a browser. Useless. Utterly useless

362,Channettewalker,"March 24, 2017",4,"Great app Great app... lets you know what's going on in the city from partying or social events. If you like to go to events at clubs or comedy shows, you can also put your name on the guest list through the app for free admission."

I haven‚Äôt received any info on it and no one responded to my email.  I guess I‚Äôm going to have to contact my credit card company and ask for a refund if they don‚Äôt send me the information!!!
367,Takingwolfman74,"April 3, 2019",1,Useless! This app could not find your tickets to save itself. Just wasted an hour trying to find tickets though a email it sent. After paying for the tickets the only way this app finds your tickets is if you pay for them again. Don‚Äôt wast your time with this  app go with the paper tickets.
368,Revanchist1ab,"November 15, 2019",5,Works as Intended Make sure you use the correct email when logging in.
369,Chris664518,"November 13, 2019",3,Needs some work City range filters do not work. Navigating back/forward in results goes to random spots in a list of all the events.

Obviously I've signed up before.... don't remember honestly but when trying to reset password to get tickets it keeps sending an email stating to reset password.

376,Scammers Not Welcome,"December 7, 2019",1,"Ticket confirmation keeps popping up After you registered for an event, ticket confirmation screen keeps popping up and no way to close it. When it closes, it keeps disrupting by popping up again. Only way to stop the loop is by exiting app and then for it to be all over again after registering for another event"
377,LaneWildlife,"October 2, 2019",1,Scam!!!! This app and this company is a giant scam! Please do yourself a favor and do not download this app or use Eventbrite for any ticket purchase. I ordered two tickets to an event. Not only did they charge nearly $40 for service and transaction fees but they also charged me for 8 tickets instead of 4. Then it is impossible to contact anyone about a refund. It is a total scam!
378,Attritus,"September 21, 2019",1,"Terrible user experience Search is next to useless. Even though you know an event exists, search will not bring it up. Then, even if you‚Äôre logged in, it forces you to type in your name, cc info, etc. It doesn‚Äôt even let you use apple‚Äôs native autofill. Massively disrespectful to the user‚Äôs time. Find another service if you can."
379,Kitty-D,"September 11, 2019",5,I love this app! Not only do I use it for local events but also for events in other states when I travel.

387,Zacouwa,"October 11, 2019",1,Literally was on my ticket price and then pushed me back I was waiting for a hour to get my ticket and I was on the second it came out. I know there was a lot of other people trying to get the ticket but the app literally pushed me out and went to the 2 tier option. Im going to just go back to the other app I used before.

393,Telliamor,"September 29, 2017",3,The new interface is nice but buggy I can‚Äôt access things happening today tomorrow or this weekend when I double tap the search icon. It‚Äôs kind of annoying. Please fix
394,TJ_Wuth,"January 31, 2018",2,Annoying bug I only use the app when I have to like when the host organization chooses to use it. Whenever I open the app it takes over my display brightness and turns it up all the way. There is no reason this app should mess with that setting.

444,A frustrated Eventbrite user,"February 10, 2019",1,"Joshua Johnson 1A St. Petersburg, FL Eventbrite is truly the most difficult online event ticketing service I have encountered. Because there is a standby list, I have been trying to give back one of my two tickets since Friday‚Äîit is so incredibly unclear to me how to do that, I gave up and will simply tell someone at the door that I have two tickets and will use one."
445,cnst,"December 23, 2019",1,"Doesn‚Äôt work offline It was supposed to work offline, but doesn‚Äôt seem to do that. It was either always broken on iOS or got broken recently, because such functionality is clearly meant to be here."
446,tmw4952,"November 17, 2019",2,"Annoying The amount of time this app crashes, freezes, won‚Äôt load a page is crazy. I lost tickets because of it. The search feature is also so inaccurate. Needs a lot of work."
447,LunaCairo,"November 13, 2019",2,"Apple Pay I don‚Äôt see why this app doesn‚Äôt incorporate Apple Pay... it‚Äôs nearly 2020, there should be Apple Pay to make the checkout process faster.

I have even typed in the name of event (using app) and BOOM nothing. I also increased the distance thinking that would help NOPE!! App is only good for housing your tickets and adding events to your calendar.
454,rayllla,"November 10, 2017",1,Canceled concert and the website was still selling tickets How it‚Äôs possible that you can still buy tickets for a concert that got cancelled???? At least it should had a note saying that the show won‚Äôt happen at the original dates!! Disappointed and I can‚Äôt find a telephone number to call.
455,SJohnsonsf,"September 22, 2018",2,"Recent update The latest update doesn‚Äôt appear to have been tested thoroughly. My name is not displayed correctly on the profile - letters are cut off. Also, when viewing tickets, brightness increases but does not decrease after switching away from the app."

I contacted support and they were always extremely slow to answer and refused to help me get my money back. This shouldn‚Äôt be allowed that they can just take hundreds of dollars because of some bug and refuse to give it back to me.
465,"Andrea, fall 2018","February 9, 2019",1,"It‚Äôs great unless you need to help The app was good, the concept is good, it‚Äôs easy to use, unless something goes wrong and you need assistance.

785,savahana2,"October 21, 2018",5,Nicholas Sparks Once in a lifetime you meet an author who seems to understand how you feel. You can listen to his writing and it‚Äôs not about the character but you become the characters. The event Brite celebrations are exceptional and there is an empty chair tonight. It is mine but I am well and writing it from my little home here in South Carolina. Not far from the guilard center where you are. I was at the cabin last week when the storm rushed through and I had said a prayer just before I heard a crash. I looked outside and a big oak just missed our historic cabin. Nicholas too and many others of us have tried to weather the storm. In the morning five deer watched us clear trees. It took probably sixty years to grow those trees. I hope someone plants more. Everyone is giving to the Red Cross and helping each other the best we can. My mother was a Red Cross volunteer and so am I. I did make it to Greenville to the event. My life was the real life Savahana married to John. That was a lifetime ago already. It‚Äôs hard to believe someone could capture our real lives and put them onto paper. Other books by Nicholas Sparks I could find myself in. Gabbys point with those puppy‚Äôs and the vow. And I have a safe haven in my life also. But Nicholas Sparks captures so many people feelings so well in words that no matter which heroine he writes about I know how she feels. An amazing author. I got his latest book and have read halfway through. I was overwhelmed. I got it for my daughter. And one for myself but I cried. Part of the story is actually magical. That‚Äôs the part I hold onto. The second copy I bought I need to pick up somehow or see that someone gets it. A book is powerful. It‚Äôs intimate. Someone ask who died in the novel. Well there were many deaths and I suppose it‚Äôs something we each must face. Were created were unique. Even the animals you‚Äôll have twins ok some are almost a carbon copy. Like in dear John I watch the movie and see the actress and I remember there were how many soldiers going through the same thing. One thing that John had told me before he went to war that the dear John letter is a saying that goes way back in history and had happened before he told me never ever send him a dear John letter. I‚Äôm sorry we write so many letters back in forth in our lives and the ones I write to him all I could say was dear John. In that respect it was as if we had lived before. One thing also the author does so well is makes us question our choices our decisions our actions in a good way. Look at us how are we acting. What are the consequences of one tear and what causes that tear to be shed. And can they be unshed. Love means never having to say you‚Äôre sorry but sometimes it‚Äôs necessary. Stevens forgiveness star. Jan 6. He‚Äôs another author friend of mine who passed away recently. I was blessed from my childhood to be raised in an amazing library surrounded by books. My father was my first story teller. The place was divided between fiction and non fiction but my father showed me a secret. He said something that you think are fantasy are reality and visa versa. You know big foot? And I‚Äôd laugh and he said you know a space ship and I‚Äôd laugh. What if though. What if your life on earth has a greater purpose? What if someday someone is going to write a movie about how you style your hair or how you drink a cup of coffee and how you saved that kittens life. And what if they include the grief you feel when the kittens Mother‚Äôs isn‚Äôt able to be saved. And you look around yourself and say I love this little house I love my life. And it‚Äôs in a book I can read about it and it‚Äôs in a book I can imagine I was there and can almost taste that coffee. Or maybe I‚Äôd rather have a cup of milk. It seems like a simple moment but life is made of simple moments. The grief that we are experiencing in the hurricane will make some of you feel there is no god. It is a really hard thing. My father was a sailor and I‚Äôve been through hurricanes with him before. I can not tell you what to believe and when you loose your faith I can not tell you to have faith. That is up to the individual. Earnest Hemingway was pretty depressed when he wrote the old man and the sea. But I‚Äôm glad he did. I‚Äôm glad for books. The red pony too. What makes every  breath so important is that every breath is a gift from god and important. And the mailbox is magical. You can send letters through time What will you put in it something happy or something sad. Will your words change a life for the better or for the worse. And do you have to send every letter that you have? And can you create a letter that changes a life. Nicholas Sparks said he could have written a better book if I hadn‚Äôt dumped John. I don‚Äôt even want to talk about it. I just wanted to let you know why my seat is empty today. Also my guest a little furry friend is a bit tired from travel. She would have Been happy to come again. Greenville is practically on the other side of our great state. And traffic well it actually wasn‚Äôt too heavy. Oh every breath there‚Äôs one other reason why the book means so much it‚Äôs because of adoption. Adoption affects my family. There are adopted members. It is an option for someone. And it has touched my life. It touches my heart to know that Nicholas wrote about it. It also touches my heart that he is willing to talk about intimacy. So openly. Some people are like no not that part and others are like oh read it again that‚Äôs the best part and some people are like what is a book like without it. Then the hero. The unexpected stranger who calls and changes everything. One last word on Nicholas Sparks he has a million readers. He treats his readers special like he genuinely cares about each one. One lady said he sent my mother a greeting card. It was so special I came across the nation to meet him in person. That‚Äôs someone who cares.

1445,Sevie68,"August 28, 2018",1,"Poor treatment given to a handicapped person participating in the event I am simply appalled how one of my guest who uses a wheelchair was meant to feel embarrassed and unwelcome to the event. I really don‚Äôt understand how you meet the ADA act at your events. I did everything that was expected. Your owner and the staff ignored my guest, let her at the top of the ramp with my husband because we were told that we couldn‚Äôt get her on ourselves and the staff would help. After group after group walked around her to get on to the ship I went for the third time to inquire about helping her on to the boat. After the third time of talking to organizers and the management of Haskell‚Äôs with no one responding to her as we wave from the boat as the guests flowed onto the ship, the ship‚Äôs captain heard me an immediately went to aid her. This was 20 minutes if waiting with no help. The Captain with no one else from Haskell‚Äôs or the crew responding needed the help of my husband and an attendee to get her safely down the ramp with angle more than 60 degree straight down to the doors of the boat. This put an undue embarrassment to my friend and the other guests with me. Never did anyone from the Haskell team speak to her, offer assistance or explain how she could find handicapped bathrooms or get to other levels of the ship to enjoy the full experience. At the end of trip I wheeled her to the doors and again ask the owner of Haskell‚Äôs 3 tines where are the staff to help. He said the crew outside securing the boat would help quit annoyed. Again I had to ask the crew, not him, and only 1 crew member grabbed her chair and ran up the plank where she almost fell out if the chair twice. At the top, no one was there to help her get to the unloading waiting area. It was awful. "

I  ordered my ticket on the web (didn't create an account at the time). I got an email with the ticket attached as a PDF. There was a link in the email to get this app. I tapped it and installed Eventbrite from the App Store. When I first ran the app, it immediately said that it was sending me an email so that I could set my login password and access my purchased events.  I instantly got their email, clicked the link, and was taken back into the Eventbrite app to choose a password.  After setting a strong password, I remained in the app and could see the event I'm going to and see my Eticket.  I don't think it could have been any easier.  üëç"
1461,colinsweet,"November 26, 2014",1,"Crap I click on ""My Tickets"", and it tells me to enter my email. I do so, and click continue, and it tells me it sent me an email to set up my account (which I've already done). Then I go back to ""My Tickets"", enter my email and click continue, and it tells me it sent me an email. I tried several times and ended up sending myself 4 emails, but I couldn't figure out how to log in to access the tickets in the app that I already purchased on my computer. All the emails do is tell me to reset my password. After doing so, I was able to log in on my computer, but using the same email and password I couldn't log in on the app - it just says it doesn't recognize the email/password. Then Iogged out on my computer, and tried to log back in, and it said that it didn't recognize the email/password (that I just set up a few minutes ago). Now I'm back to the multiple emails problem. Good work, way to go. I almost want my money back for the tickets since I can't get my money back for the free app."
1462,Miss SweetHeart,"January 1, 2015",3,"Confusing and a bit misleading, but not terrible... I keep reading complaints on here about the login page where the app would simply stay on continue. The same thing happened to me until I figured perhaps it was sending me a link to my email every time I pressed continue, which it did. There was an email for every time I clicked continue stating that I requested to make up a new password, which I didn't. I had to rely on my own initiative to figure that out as the app did not specify what I had to do. Also, I wasn't sure why I had to make a new password anyway when I've done that already. When I finally logged in I was relieved to see that my tickets were there. But another complaint I have is false advertising. I looked for events recently and some of the ticket prices listed on the app were actually a lot cheaper than the actual price of the event. I didn't appreciate that. Other than that, I use it to get in the know for different events, but these issues should be fixed."

The first thing that asks is for the email ""that I used to place my order"". Nothing else, no welcome, hi you doing, thanks for downloading this app, or at least a link to ""new members sign here"", nothing. Just a blank space, asking for my email that I used for the order I never placed. I put my email anyway, that was pretty stupid of me since I don't know nothing about this service or app. I knew that if my email wasn't recognized it will prompt me to sign up. Every app out there does that. Is basic app design 101. Not for Eventbrite. WHAT? That's right. It won't let me access anything beyond asking for the email of the order I never placed. I just hope their offices are not Nigeria. I'm not signing up for this until I find more about it."
1471,#hotdrama,"September 7, 2012",5,"Love. This app is amazing. I'm not a huge event goer because the process used to be so complicated. Now when someone tweets an event I look it up in the Eventbrite app and within seconds I have bought my ticket. I also don't have to be worrying about printing out tickets and other archaic activities, I just show my phone at the door. I've definitely bought more tickets because of the ""events around me"" feature. It makes finding, purchasing, and going to events so much easier. Thanks, great product."
1472,headphoneboy,"December 16, 2012",5,"Event Creation This app needs to allow users to create new events. Until this feature is added, it has very limited functionality."
1473,OldeMusicke,"July 26, 2013",1,Yawn I don't see what all the fuss is about. The app didn't help me find one single event of interest to me.
1474,RRawpower,"October 4, 2013",1,"Atrocious customer ""service"" For whatever this app may or may not be worth, the fact remains that Eventbrite has consistently ignored repeated reports of glaring lapses in their website and/or email communications lacking crucial date, time and place specifics for many events. For NO other reason than they simply can't be bothered to change some completely arbitrary layouts which often as not cut off said information when there is absolutely NO reason whatsoever to impose ANY restrictions in such digital space. Worse still, their reps have actually had the nerve to blame their OWN paying customers (i.e., event sponsors) for ""not complying with their formatted fields"" which were INadequately set by the company in the first place. And ALL this business is about comes down to Information Technology!"
1475,TrackDaddy,"February 23, 2014",1,"Caution - Fraud Potential The app works well, however I‚Äôve discovered that you are taking a big risk purchasing tickets through Eventbrite. We recently discovered that even though Eventbrite accepts payments on behalf of event promoters, they deny any responsibility towards providing refunds if the event promoter fails to honor the tickets they‚Äôve sold. In our case we had prepaid tickets for a 300 person event in San Francisco. When we arrived we were told that the promoter had oversold the event and no additional guests would be allowed in. Then the promoter came out and told the crowd that he‚Äôd decided to sell higher priced tickets at the door and if we had wanted to get into the event, we should have arrived earlier. And since in his view it was our fault that we could not attend the event, he would not be offering any refunds. There were at least 50 advanced ticket holders still outside the venue when we finally left. I‚Äôve contacted Eventbrite but have not received a response. Caveat emptor."
1476,corridor5,"March 11, 2014",5,"Excellent integration and support! This system just works. I visited the website of an event I wanted to attend and clicked on their Eventbrite link.

1477,Schwizzle5069,"March 18, 2014",5,Great What a Great app I planned the whole trip to Denver and I have all my events and my Passbook except one which is a bus to one of the two concerts I will be attending that weekend and I would've never known about the bus without this app. Like the Paypal option. Very easy to transfer dates and times of your events directly into your calendar... So I give it two thumbs up five stars much love and I really appreciate Eventbrite. This app has been needed for a while and I plan on checking things locally too but it made my out of town events a breeze and expect it to make future shows easy and help keep you current on events....
1478,maxaraptor,"March 16, 2015",5,"Great, buuuut.. This app is perfect and easy to use. The only thing I wish that I could change about it is when I order tickets (and say forget a person or I can only order two at time but have three people going and I have to order more) they don't get grouped together. Then I'm stuck in line going, ""Wait.. wait.. I've got one.. more.. somewh-.. DAMNIT, where is it?! Yes! It's this one! Oh.. you already scanned this one.. Okay, give me a minute..""

Even despite the one or two instances in which the app didn't refresh quick enough (but this is the case with numerous apps - so, really it's no deal breaker) or wouldn't allow me to purchase a ticket (which was a bit annoying only because I had to result to using my laptop #millennialproblems - again, not a deal breaker), I've, for the most part, haven't come into any serious road blocks with this app. It's easy to use and a great way to find out about local events occurring in or around your city. Truly, a great app all around. "
1480,Terrell Smith,"March 14, 2012",5,"Awesome I am very impressed by this app. Wow! It shows a map, so you can get driving, bus or walking directions, it shows your ticket for ticket scanning, all your past and upcoming events, the event page, and allows you to contact the organizer. Very well thought out app. As for those who didn't rate it high, they did not understand that this App is for attendees, not the event organizer. There's a different app for the organizer. And as far as not having the password, just hit ""Forgot my password."" This is super good."
1481,eskobar02,"June 25, 2012",3,Simple App with enormous potential. I'm giving this App a 3 star rating because it does what they say it will do but it doesn't get a higher rating because it could do so much more. 
1482,Where the hell is Guam!?,"February 18, 2014",5,"More support than a wonder bra! The app is simple and it works. That is a large part of what Eventbrite's business is about. Make registering simple and easy. I also coordinate triathlons in my neck of the woods and recently started using Eventbrite for our race registration. Everything is intuitive, but in case you need help they have people available 24/7 to support you. That part of eventbrite is invaluable for a registrant as well as an event coordinator.  My best experience with online registration to date."
1483,Resident2015,"February 25, 2015",5,"Love it! I never write reviews because I feel it is very time consuming and boring. However, I have to write this one because Eventbrite is my favorite app! üíú I love that I can find all types of events (huge, small, parties, art, etc) in just one website. It is easy to pay for events, although I enjoy the free ones the most. Love how easy they are to search. If I could change one thing is that sometimes in the phone app I can't see the events that I have saved. But this is not a big deal. LOVE IT!!!"
1484,mainfloorguy,"April 8, 2015",5,"Great App! I give this a 5-star rating because it serves my needs. And I would like it even better if I could limit searches by geographical areas. For example, I would like to limit search results to events only in New Jersey. This would provide exactly the results I want and omit results that I do not want, for example events in Philadelphia. I hate to sound petty, and this is probably only a minor inconvenience. But an enhancement like this would make the app even better. Despite this, I like the app very much."
1485,Jaybaby555,"September 4, 2015",3,"Ok, but needs work... I think this app could be really great but at this point, it's just average. I do like how I can create the events in my calendar for easy reminders and typically don't ever have to print a physical ticket out which is awesome... The search function however, could stand a huge amount of improvement. I would really like to be able to search multiple areas of events versus only one at a time... It would also be amazing to have categories, ex. Music, Food, Food and Music, Networking, etc....please make some updates Eventbrite. So little could make this app so much better!!!"
1486,Llm241,"April 24, 2016",1,"No Ticket Reserve as you enter CC info I was very disappointed in my experience with this ticket purchasing platform. I had logged in for an event, and as soon as the tickets became available I clicked through. I had entered my CC info, and ALL of the additional information requested. As I clicked to submit my purchase, I was told tickets were unavailable. Eventually the status changed to 'sold out'. I already had requested 2 tickets and entered my information. I do not understand how the tickets I am currently purchasing can be sold to other people!  Definitely a flaw in the set-up. I am very disappointed to be missing a great experience due to this site, and do not recommend for other events to use."
1487,Wanna-be Stock Broker,"May 17, 2016",2,"Nice app, has bug though Like it, but app has a bug.  I was able to create an Eventbrite account without problem. I created the account because I wanted to be able to save favorite events.  At first everything was working, I saved a list of 12 events that I was interested in.  Then after searching and finding the 13 event of interest, then adding it, it saved but the previously added 12 events were lost.  I searched on my first topic, and from that resultset I saved 12 events without problem.  Then I searched on my second topic, and added 1 from that resultset, it was at that time that the previously added 12 were lost."
1488,Farside Bound,"May 20, 2016",5,Best thing for concerts since the microphone This app is killer. I use it on an iPhone and it's always a stellar experience. Makes keeping up with tickets a non issue.
1489,Dwarfsuperstar,"July 7, 2016",1,"Update is a big step backwards, STILL. In the old version, when viewing a list of events, you could read the whole event title. Now it's just a few words, and not enough to know what the event is about. So now browsing events on the iPhone is much harder and not worth the effort. They're making the same mistake that the iTunes App Store has been making forever on the iPhone. Why would I tap on an app or an event when the title is so truncated that it reveals almost nothing about the app or event?"
1490,Miss A. Speaking,"April 6, 2013",2,"I like keeping events in one place This app is good but for as long as I've had it, the same glitch keeps occurring. The notifications keep popping up on my screen, despite turning off all of the notifications in my iPhone setting. "
1491,Busy.C,"June 13, 2013",4,"ALMOST perfect but... everytime im searching for events under a category and register for it, the appl takes me back to my 'home page' which lists the events i'm going to. i wish it went back to the same section i was viewing before buying the tickets. its a hassle to go back to category and scroll all the way down to where i left off. (perhaps you guys can fix this on an update?) besides that, this is a really convenient app to have!"
1492,Sfdowntown,"January 5, 2014",1,Terrible This app used to be great. The update and redesign blasts my eyes with screen brightness and it keeps my screen this way. I even called them to report it and nothing has been done. Lease go back to the previous way of handling the screen brightness which was unobtrusive. I will delete until they make this important change. No app should take over the screen brightness without permission. This is obtrusive and irritating. I understand the need to brightness me for the ticket reader.  Whatever this is the only time the screen should be really bright. When I go back to the list of events it should dim like it used to before the update
1493,mister zed,"August 30, 2015",3,"Missing most important feature for a phone app The most important thing to have on your phone is a reminder of things you're interested in: those you've  bookmarked or bought tickets for.  Everything else you can just as easily do on a computer, but getting reminders needs to be with you wherever you are.   Bookmarks should result in reminders a week and then a day before, and buying tickets should result in a day and then an hour before, or be configurable."
1494,Trigga Tre Day,"November 4, 2015",3,"Good app The app and what it provides is amazing for entrepreneurs! It's a must have. My biggest issue this the app (hints the 3 stars) is that every time I log in it create a whole new acct for me and all of my data that was loaded within the other about is completely gone. There is no ""oh this acct doesn't exist"" or ""did you forget you password"".... It just creates a completely new acctüò£! I find that to be the most insane way of having a membership base site. There is no security from what it looks like.  I really hope you guys change this feature all together. Thanks."
1495,YGOfanatic,"December 12, 2015",5,First time using this app; no issues so far This is the first time I used Eventbrite as an app and so far I haven't had any problems. The reason I started using the app is b/c someone who I work with recommended it; also I didn't know there was another method of downloading tickets besides going online and it is much easier to use than having tickets on paper! I like it and I hope to continue using it whenever there will be an event üòÑ.
1496,Dmariee1994,"December 29, 2015",4,"Best event app, a little more organized with lists of events I love this app because I can always look for events and parties to go to in the city. I also love that I can not only purchase my ticket on this app but the ticket saves on my phone so I don't have to deal with finding a printer to print out my ticket or trying to open up my email . I do wish they had events in a category so I don't have to look through a whole bunch of different events, but it's a good app!"
1497,Wyldflowr,"March 20, 2016",5,"Great app!! Coming from someone who goes to many nightculture and discodonnie events, this app makes my life so easy! In just a couple clicks I can find and pay for tickets to events I want to go to then simply pull up the tickets on my phone. And since I just need to log into the eventbrite app to access the tickets, I can pull them up on any phone! (And I let my phone die all the time so this really helps!)"

After waiting an hour we had to contact the event promoter and were informed the party bus (that was taking us to the yacht) broke down and we would be refunded our money. I was given the run around and finally was told it could take up to 4days for my money to be back in my account. It has now been 3weeks since I was told that and no one is responding back. Also, I don't think things should be deleted off my profile unless I delete them. I came back here to see if there was anymore info on the promoter and the event was deleted."

1502,TheMasterCook,"February 6, 2013",5,"Works, but the my tickets area needs work The app is cool. It's functional, but the area that is probably used the most needs work. The My Tickets area doesn't have an Update mechanism. So if you're buying the ticket online, through your computer, and you go to the app, the ticket is not immediately there. That doesn't instill confidence. Later on, it finally shows up."

For those of us that enjoy activities, learning, face-to-face networking, and getting out of the house, this app is a convenient tool for exploring community events. It's even helpful when trying to find interesting things to do in a city/area you may be visiting. More businesses, organizations, churches, groups, etc. need to jump on board! A big thanks to the creators and developers of this awesome app!"
1504,SianR,"May 25, 2013",1,"Very poor.. Full if promise then bad delivery This app appears promising but has a useless interface. Once you allow it to 'know your location' it's impossible to turn off that feature. You would think events would be organized by Date, but they are not - who decided that does obviously not know how to keep an event diary."
1505,Drawstanley,"July 30, 2015",2,"Frustrating I know app developers have a tough job. However I think this is another example of the only game in town being a poor game. I have used this app as an adjunct with and through other apps. Eventbrite performs poor to okay. It is spotty in how well it does and what details of your account it remembers. Right now I have a ticket that I can get to/view via their site, but not through the app on mobile. Additionally connection thru other apps or events can be very problematic and brings into question the stability of Eventbrite data and backend dev."
1506,emcampbe,"August 4, 2015",1,"Won't stay logged in Before the latest version, things seemed to be ok. Not the best app to use, not near the worst, either. I'm typically using to check up on the events I administer. "
1507,Theronrr,"December 14, 2015",2,Out of control The idea of this app is good but management is bad. Examples today looking at local events and first thing that popped up was let us say was very close to pornographic picture for some event. Something me nor my spouse would want to see. Or any family member. Secondary you can't don't see ticket numbers on passboard that came on the pdf. You cannot search on the ticket numbers nor transfer to another email account. As you would want if you giving as a gift or changing providers. Help is lacking so much. This could be a great app but not yet
1508,Harleeangel,"January 8, 2016",1,"More tickets than seats Even though I had a ticket, the building was to capacity and the doors were locked. I understand this was a free event, but why waste my time to register for a ticket and go to an event only to be turned away. "
1509,enter.another,"June 1, 2016",2,"Does not show invitations I attend events for which I receive invitations (emails sent by Eventbrite), yet these invitations never show up in the app itself, which is logged on using the exact same email address to which I receive the invitations. So each time I have to go to the PC, open the email, register with the web form, and only then does the event show in the app. Even opening the invitation email in Gmail on iOS doesn't link to the app. Fix this (view and accept invites within the app), and I will give it a five-star rating for time saved instead of wasted."
1510,sometimestuesday,"September 5, 2012",5,This app keeps me organized! So happy they made an app for attendees. I go to a lot of events and plan them as well. This app keeps all of my tickets organized in one place so I don't have to print. Love the new feature where you can find events going on near you as well. Huge fan of their entry app that I use to check guests in during my events too!
1511,Bryan1464,"April 30, 2013",5,"Great app great site I recently helped run a fundraiser and used eventbrite. We created the event on the site and used the apps ""entry,"" and ""at the door."" These all were unbelievably easy to use and helped so much with check in and selling tickets at the door. It made our event easier to run and to keep track of the number of attendees and money taken in. The organization with the site and apps is amazing."
1512,Annamark123,"November 25, 2013",4,Easy to use with just enough info needed Easily understood application which provides just enough information needed for an event. Better than other applications than can overload folks with tons of information. Leave some details to be discovered at the event as oppose to trying to find everything over the internet; it's a buzz kill at times. Satisfied with the features overall.
1513,Satin Wellness,"June 3, 2014",5,Brilliant! Eventbrite has helped my business referral network expand quickly. As the president of an in home personal training company we have expanded rapidly and were having difficulty finding prospective clients in new areas.

I just entered my login details and the app picked up the reservation I had made online. It also allowed me to save the tickets to Passbook. It's also shows all event taking place during the weekend in you area. That's all I could ask for!!!
1516,Lynnejordan14568,"June 3, 2015",4,"Cool, but could be better I love eventbrite! I just got this app a few minutes ago and it works pretty well, I would like to see the registrants notification come to the app and not my email because it gets lost pretty easily...and possibly be able to build an event on the app, or be able to send the email invites through it that way I don't have to bring my laptop everywhere I could just use my phone or IPad."
1517,Wbwowzer,"August 17, 2015",1,"App but even close to using the CPU version I used eventbrite for a ticketed workshop o found the website version easy to use and lots of function.  The app does not allow enough controls for organizers to effectively manage their events from their smart device.  Added features such as guest list editing, wait list or even the ability to edit your event would be greAt.  For now it just allows you to monitor (watch) ticket sales and see an attendee list. I think there is a ton of function that could be put in the app for event organizers then I would use it exclusively for all my ticket sales!"
1518,Arthurhzuo,"April 18, 2016",5,"Suggestions As an active user frequently seeking for valuable events in a relatively fixed location, I sincerely wish the app could add a functionality for users to bookmark/save event organizers, for high quality organizers can always hold attractive events, yet for several occasions I missed them. And the email latent factor recommendation algorithm needs some serious remodeling."
1519,Marisolbenny,"July 25, 2016",5,"Fairly decent when the app corporates When searching for a particular venue/show, the app often does not pull up the event. I have better luck purchasing these events by logging on a computer for these particular venues/shows ( yes I have used the filters to help). But for music festivals I can generally find them quick & easy to purchase."
1520,LiveFreeNow83,"April 4, 2012",5,"Does what it says and does it well With this app you can not register for new events. You can only look at upcoming and past events you've registered for, share the event, and map out the event location.

1521,hnic23,"December 26, 2012",5,"Yes, Thank You! A great app that even lists events in remote areas!  Many ""social"" apps promise connection, but only work for large cities or metropolitan areas, sometimes over 100 miles away.

1522,HappyFrappyLisa,"June 1, 2014",5,"Nice but Limited It's cool that you can see what events are going on in the area and the price (if any) at quick glance.

1528,Cycle Sister,"April 30, 2016",4,"Great Event Finder You can sign up for events without being spammed afterward. The categories are very useful for finding events specific to an industry or career field. I also appreciate that many events list a POC, should you need to reach out about anything. I do think this app could be hit or miss depending on where you live. This app is useless if there isn't a high  enough concentration of users in your area."
1529,fromsalinastocity,"September 27, 2016",3,"PLEASE PLEASE ADD A CALENDAR FEATURE!!! I love Eventbrite, but it blows my mind that an app who's sole purpose is to schedule events, doesn't have its own calendar within the app. I like that I can view event's in my default calendar, but it would be super helpful to view and search for Eventbrite events in a calendar layout. Sometimes I'm looking for events on a specific day, and I can't do that through the app. If this feature was added, it'd definitely be a 5 star app!"

1546,Anne-Michelle,"January 26, 2015",3,Overall Good I like the app very much. I organize events and it's easy to access all of them. The only thing that doesn't work for me is the scanner. It scans one ticket then doesn't work on any others unless I close the scanner and reopen it after every ticket. Makes it cumbersome to check multiple people in. This feature used to work perfectly but not so much anymore.

1553,IdanBenaim,"February 4, 2013",4,"Great platform, App needs improvements Eventbrite is an amazing product. It would be great to have the ability to access personal information on the mobile app and create new events too. As far as showing tickets on Passbook, it would be great to have a default option."
1554,tmgnordlie,"May 21, 2013",5,Good easy app Have joined two different events using Eventbrite and have had a seamless operating experience each time. I added the latest event to my calendar and was able to download the tickets directly to my phone which is very convenient.
1555,sitting_here_laughing,"April 11, 2014",5,"Like it but I really dig this app a lot, it connects to passbook which is amazing- only problem is that it won't let me add the event to my calendar- the button/link doesn't work and its pretty frustrating. Other than that I have no problems :)"
1556,Kman4546,"August 5, 2014",4,"Has great potential A great app if you want to know what events are happening when and where. The only thing keeping me from rating 5 stars is that it needs an easier way to add tickets to passbook. I had to open my email and copy the link I got and paste it in my chrome app. Other than that, a very good app."
1557,rosandyreel,"April 30, 2015",2,"Can't create an event in the app? Dumb Why on earth would you have an event app, but not allow people to create an event in the app? That's just dumb. To have to physically go into the full website for eventbrite to do this is an unnecessary step. My primary use for the app is creating events for my organization. That was the only reason i downloaded the app because I thought I would be able to easily create events in the app. WRONG! Please get a clue and add this feature."
1558,Trashbuster,"January 4, 2016",4,"Not too shabby I am a first time user, so I don't have a lot to say at this point other than it is pretty cool. I like what I see, the concept is great and it saves me from having to carry paper. I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4 but I wish to reserve my opinion until I have logged a few miles with it üòÄ"
1559,rrl98a,"June 16, 2016",5,Why would you not get this app? There is really no reason. If people have a problem they should contact customer service not post here. This app makes life easier not just events. Keep the updates coming!
1560,Your Bookkeeper,"April 25, 2012",5,"Totally useful Not only can I just use my phone as my ticket to the event, I also don't need to use multiple apps to get there. I tap on the event, tap on the map and voila!  It takes me to my maps and I can then get immediate directions without ever typing a word. Bravo!"
1561,chrkuhl28,"February 1, 2013",5,Convenient and simple This has made my concert going experience so much easier. 
1562,TheGFXNovice,"July 22, 2013",4,"Great ... But! I think the application is great, easy to use, and very useful :) but I recently encountered something that I think should be taken into account. Multiple emails on one account ... Many people have multiple emails and it would be really convenient if Eventbrite allowed multiple email accounts :D"
1563,Picnopodia,"September 29, 2014",5,"So easy to find events This app is great for finding all kinds of events in town. User friendly interface, easy to use and has all your tickets organized. You don't even have to print your ticket, it's in your phone. I love it!!!"
1564,Johhny Pissoff,"June 11, 2015",3,"Finally Connects to server It would not connect to the Eventbrite server for several hours, when the wifi internet connection was working fine for everything else on the iPhone 4 and a mixed bunch of computers. I tried one last time before writing a scathing review but wonder of wonders it connected and downloaded the ticket I wanted just fine, as claimed."
1565,Rlansdell00,"July 23, 2015",5,Easy as pie! I've used this app for ordering tickets to 2 separate events. It's easy to maneuver and then you have the tickets right there on the app so you don't have to worry about forgetting your event tickets. I'd highly recommend using this app to order tickets!
1566,marywoofbury,"August 3, 2015",1,"Useless app I downloaded this for the 2nd time, despite having major trouble with it a year ago. I paid through PayPal, got an email link, signed in over and over again only to get varying fail messages over and over again. After wasting too much time, I we to computer mail, got the link , and printed the tickets. I will try to avoid buying anything in the future that involves this aggravating app. They have had way too much time to fix problems."
1567,Trump 2017,"December 29, 2015",5,"Simple and Convenient This app allows a quick 5 minute registration for every rally I've attended, and provides the tickets right to my watch to be scanned when I arrive. I also receive emails when he returns to my area, ensuring I don't miss a single event"
1568,Kapteva,"March 31, 2016",1,"App not useful The app doesn't have basic filters so you can organize it by date you want to search the events. There are only a few options - the city, the type of event, what's this weekend, recommended and popular. If I want to find all the events going on on Tuesday evening - it is impossible to search.  Popular/recommended have many different dates and I can't get the info I am looking for. Useless app, I always go to the website instead."
1569,Cheeeeee55555,"June 27, 2016",5,"Informed me when there was a slot available on a full event. I love that it informs you when there's an available slot on a full event that you like. But I couldn't comment on people using credit cards because I attend the free ones. Based on my experience, this app is awesome."
1570,greengobstopper,"September 5, 2012",2,"Finding Events It's great for looking at events you have booked already through their website, but searching for events is a mess. Manually entering a location doesn't work, so you can't use it to find events in a different city than the one you are currently in. And there so little sorting, so if you're in say NYC where 10k events come up on one night, there's no way to narrow down your event browsing."
1571,J4hmtor,"October 7, 2012",5,"Easy, fast and useful! Keeps all your events, may it be important or not in one place! Log in with your Facebook account and bam! You can see all the events near you! With just one tap, you can register without a sweat. And of course, Passbook integration is just SWEET!"
1572,bigal406,"October 17, 2012",5,"Need a social life??? Well this app can make a flaccid social life pop and take a stand to rid those social whoas you've been feeling. Ok, if you don't get my drift than here's the short end ... It will place you at potential locations to get you laid. Check it out!"
1573,HuSquared,"November 3, 2012",5,"Huge step up Eventbrite has been around for many years now and this App is just a huge step up for them. Love that I can have QR codes for my events stored in one place, keep track of my schedule and invite friends. Good work!"
1574,Kakejelly,"January 31, 2014",4,Useful as they come I use this app all the time .. I get the convenience of being able to purchase the night they release and ease of access upon entering the venues. Only downside is some of the surcharges for ordering online can get stupid especially if you're buying more than one ticket...~~JK~~
1575,Hoss MacIntyre,"June 17, 2014",5,Excellent App - Easy to use This app is super to work with and is compatible with many of the built in apps already set up with Apple products. It even offers additional event options no matter where you are in the world! Great stuff! Thanks!
1576,Redstripe510,"September 24, 2014",5,"Appreciate the update I like that I don't have to print out tickets anymore but was annoyed of having to sign in. NOW, I just signed up for an event and was expecting to sign in, and there was no need too. It recognized who I was and bam! Tickets are ready for me! Thank. You."
1577,Tttttsgugd,"October 14, 2014",3,"Why can't I have more than 1 email address? As far as event management apps go, I'm sure it's fine. Frankly, I attend events, I don't plan them. Sometimes I attend professional events, sometimes I attend personal events. Do I really have to use the same email address for both? Odd. The message boards are full of similar comments, so I don't think I'm missing something..."
1578,Curvydivalady,"June 3, 2015",2,Eh Doesn't save the events I choose to save. Doesn't link up to my saved event in FB even though I'm logged in on the app.  Doesn't show my tickets purchased without having to log in constantly.  Doesn't show all events in my area that I know are posted through eventbrite.  Doesn't show an event when I search by exact name after I've saved it on FB and try to purchase tickets via the app.  UGH!
1579,Dilema Duck,"July 11, 2016",5,Very useful app Very handy. Easily locates activities and events. Makes finding activities/events and purchasing tickets to events simple. I had issues with previous editions but they have definitely worked out the kinks.
1580,DJ Mr. Grant,"October 8, 2012",5,Truly digital tickets Having all my tickets in one place AND having them pop up at the appropriate time makes entry into events so much easier! Great for the environment too‚Äîno more printing an email just to toss it after I enter an event.

1583,Padawan_Jake,"May 9, 2013",5,"Love it! Used Eventbrite for 3 different events. Very convenient; prefer it over paper tickets. Used customer service to apply a discount after I had purchased a ticket, and was extremely satisfied with the outcome and response and time."
1584,Prince MaKaLong,"October 20, 2013",5,"Fantastic!!!!!! I didn't realized there are so many events going on around my area before using this app. I love is because it is beautifully designed, easy to use, and it can add any ticket to passbook which is my favorite!"
1585,Terminator 8=======D,"September 18, 2014",5,Great apps for business events Eventbrite makes sign up easy and brings tickets
1586,CocoaBeanBruce,"October 19, 2014",4,"Great app A really useful app for keeping my tickets to events in one place, and not having to print out paper tickets; plus I like the feature of being able to use eventbrite for my own events, like distributingy next business strategy...inviting a select audience...useful!!"
1587,@meechele7,"June 26, 2015",5,"Technology Integrationist I've been using eventbrite for the past couple of years,  and I am so pleased with how easily it functions on all of my devices. I only wish I could use it for every kind of ticket I have to hold onto."
1588,TM Power,"November 30, 2015",1,Problem with this app After wasting almost 40 minutes trying to login and resetting my password on this app I finally went to my computer to log into eventbrite so that I could find some tickets I purchased. Logging in on the computer I could find the tickets but not through this app. I thought the reason why we had abs on our cell phones or for situations such as this. Unfortunately it does not work.
1589,Black_Gandalf,"June 5, 2016",4,"Best app to stay up to date on local events Best app to stay up to date on local events such as concerts, festivals, and shows. They have the right filters to make it easy to search by city and dates. Really useful when traveling to a new city and looking for things to do."
1590,Nickelpants,"November 27, 2012",5,"Love love I have been strictly using the website for eventbrite but I am always on the move. I was offered this app and tried I on a whim and I LOVE it! It moves quickly, it's easy to understand and I will no longer go without it :)"
1591,Amber koko,"April 8, 2013",5,"A whole new world of opportunities! Totally awesome way to advertise events and cool way for people like me to see what cool events I can go to.  I'd have no idea of how many seminars, races, speakers, etc are in my area without this.  Already wanna go to like two events a week!"
1592,Bebex2,"August 14, 2013",5,Simple and convenient I love how you can have your tickets scanned right from your phone! Also love the option to be able to add the event to my calendar with just one click!
1593,Queasyrider,"December 29, 2013",5,Great app! I just started my own business about six months ago and so far Eventbrite has been wonderful. I use it to look for opportunities to increase my knowledge into network and it has not let me down.
1594,Railphotos,"August 20, 2014",5,"Super easy to use!! It is super easy to use. You just create an account, find events you want to go to or are going to, then save them to your account. No need to hunt down info on them again."
1595,FLewis (SPEEDY),"September 29, 2014",3,"Good, but.. For the most part the app works pretty well. The location services doesn't work though when you have the setting for the app on phone set to ""while using."" It only works when location services are set to always on. Just a little bug that needs to be fixed."
1596,Alexillest,"November 22, 2014",5,Convenient! Great I use it all the time if your a person that loves going to clubs/events this great to RSVP and get special deals. Plus you don't have to go out and buy your tickets you can get it with a touch of a button.
1597,bijoyg,"June 11, 2015",4,"Why does the app change iOS brightness? I have my brightness settings set so I can save power. When viewing details on an event, the app changes the settings to max. Not a fan of this behavior. "
1598,MangoSlices,"October 14, 2015",5,Fave Great app to look up local (or any specific city) events in your area and sign up easily without using other websites to pay (if needed). Also probably a good way for businesses to set up events as well.
1599,arpodyssey,"May 5, 2016",5,Works Great! I've never encountered difficulties. Ticket ordering and access is very straightforward. Many apps like this are not worth downloading because just a webpage would suffice.  Eventbrite actually makes it easier. I like it.
1600,SteakPerfection,"August 15, 2012",5,"Great App I received an Eventbrite Invitation to an upcoming event.  The confirming email from Eventbrite said that this app can be used to store my tickets rather than my having to print and bring my tickets.  I d/l'd the app, logged in, and presto - there are my tickets.  Great app!!"
1601,Vivian Tian,"April 21, 2013",5,"Great App Good tool to explore fun events in the city. I especially like that all tickets go directly to Passbook, and I can also easily add events to my calendar. "
1602,SagDee,"July 11, 2013",5,Love it It's such an easier way to present and keep up with events. I love the fact that I can just show my invite  on my phone instead of having to go thru my bag for a piece of paper. Try it you'll love it....
1603,rstuhler,"June 13, 2014",5,"Solid Eventbrite is the easiest and most accurate method of keeping track of event registration and ticketing around. As soon as you complete your purchase, it's available for review and printing. I highly recommend Eventbrite!"
1604,Jake_1978,"October 6, 2014",1,"Doesn't work. The app is fine until you click on my tickets. It asks you to type in your email address to send them to you, but when you check your email it is just an email to reset your password. I thought I had made an error and tried the process again, but am still not able to pull up the tickets. Just getting  reset password email.... Frustrating."
1605,LillyLilz,"March 10, 2015",5,"This App is Wonderful üåü I would give this app ten stars if I could. I went to several different events and had a wonderful time! Almost all of them were free, too! What beats that?! Nothing! Try it, go places, and have fun!"
1606,nkrafter,"November 28, 2015",1,ZERO Stars It's 36 out and I'm up and out the door at 7:20 to attend an Eventbrite hosted run.  I received a confirmation email on Thurs about the sched 5k for this morning.  No one arrived and although having sent an email inquiry to the event contact yes afternoon and then Frantic emails this morning as I tried to get in touch with anyone who might know what was going on.  Why did I get  reminder for an event that no longer existed. I blame Eventbrite and the Renegades 2015 promoters for loss of $$$ and of My Time!!!
1607,fobdesign,"March 16, 2016",2,"Great app events, hard to locate the event location. Everything is great, but location feature need more work."
1608,Lauren4443,"May 30, 2016",5,WORKED SO WELL I went to Boston Calling and bought four tickets throughout the week leading up to it and it automatically loaded onto my phone and I had no problem getting in.
1609,Jogster64,"June 21, 2016",5,Easy to use I sign up for runs and other fundraising events using this app. I like the convenience of having a reminder pop up plus I don't have to worry about printing a ticket.
1610,briamr,"April 5, 2013",5,"Excellent app, minor tweaks needed! App is excellent, but come on... Let me add more than one email address to an account... I've got like ten of them and eventbrite makes it very difficult to get everything under control!"
1611,JewelJustICE,"April 27, 2013",3,"Can't dismiss reminder notifications I love the app and how it's formatted but I'm beginning to take issues with the constant bombardment of reminders that cannot be dismissed. It would be helpful to add a dismiss button to the add and if one already exist, it would be helpful to make it easy to locate for new app users such as myself."
1612,Randall G.,"November 4, 2013",5,"Fantastic app!  User-friendly I especially appreciate the 'contact event organizer' link.  I've had to use it a few times, and immediately got answers to my questions (depends on the event, of course)."
1613,CuratorMom,"January 26, 2015",5,"Effective App The Eventbrite app works great for my purpose, storing and using my Eventbrite tickets. It is more convenient than finding an email or printing tickets. I don't have any other needs from it, so it's perfect and simple."
1614,Sungold7,"March 3, 2015",5,"Very Good App I have used this several times now for various events, and I love that I can just show my phone at the admission gate and they can scan it.  It saves me from having to print a ticket."
1615,pfraser,"March 27, 2015",3,"Ok, but could be better A decent app for keeping track of events for which you have purchased tickets. But if you are running an event, it is of limited value. You can see who is coming, which is nice, but, for example, if you want to invite additional people by email, you can't."
1616,Vera / –í–µ—Ä–∞,"August 3, 2015",3,Bring back the map! And distance limit too for Nearby while you are at it.
1617,GI TROJAN GIRL8713,"October 18, 2015",5,"‚úåüèæÔ∏èüëçüèæ Love this ""plan my entertainment"" app! App is very easy to navigate.

Every event should be via electronic tix....more efficient!!"
1618,App user554368,"October 27, 2015",5,Primitive! This app is very primitive! It's more about the company advertisement than client's benefit. It doesn't even have a place to enter the order number or ticket number and look for the event that I just signed up for.
1619,annaroseannadanna,"March 9, 2016",5,"Awesome Get all your local events in one place, order tickets or sign up for free events. It's so cool!  Love my eventbrite!  I've never had problems with the app and is easy to figure out how to use. I recommend it for all ages!"
1620,pleomorphed,"October 15, 2012",5,Passbook integration rocks! We used Eventbrite to organize an event for our non-profit group and were impressed by the Passbook integration! It popped the ticket on our screen when we got near the venue!  Very nice feature.
1621,WhitePython01,"October 26, 2012",3,Works Great except PayPal It's really simple and easy to use but still has all the features of Eventbrite online! Great app for my new iPhone. Only problem is I have to go to the website to check out with PayPal because in the app it tells me my password for PayPal is wrong but it works fine on the website.
1622,AlliePea,"April 15, 2013",2,"Really disappointing I found the functions lacking (not much interaction with the event or hosts after registering, no changing RSVP!) and it overrode my notifications settings. In fact I got so irritated at the reminders EVERY FIVE MINUTES even though I have them turned off that I deleted the app! Guess what? A week later, after removing the app from my iPhone I'm still getting them! Epic fail."
1623,Tanchora2,"April 25, 2013",5,"Very convenient ! Even though I couldn't  find an event in app , I like this app . I bought a ticket online and it showed up in my app after . So , I don't need to print it out and worry about forgetting it . Love it !"
1624,Crispin.P.Martinez,"November 4, 2013",5,"Very useful I get many eventbrite invites from businesses I like, my company & other sources. It's an easy way to accept invitations and keep track of tickets to events that can go right into passbook."

1630,DRDRDR,"December 11, 2012",5,Great! ONE SUGGESTION Please make the arrangement of the home screen tiles customizable like in Flipboard (where you can hold one down to move it around).
1631,carcustomizer,"April 7, 2013",4,"Needs better search feature & accompanying iPad app! Search feature needs to be tweaked some and there needs to be an iPad version of this app!! With those problems fixed, I'd give it a full 5 stars. Still great app!"
1632,dfvera,"October 8, 2013",1,"Ruined. Streamlined? How about ""useless""? You guys killed all the good features. The discovery feature and it's categories is way too broad now. And the most helpful thing about precious versions was the ability to see what my friends were attending, which doesn't appear Ir is broken now (even though I have notifications on in settings)."
1633,Destroyer_Rino,"July 7, 2015",5,Best event app yet! Not even joking this app is all actaully has events that actually interest people. From the Motorcross Glen Helen races to awesome stoner events this has them all. Don't like stoner and your an alcoholic? They even have events for you guys lol! Beer tasting! Cheers!
1634,Harize,"January 18, 2016",4,"Very useful I use it every week to sign up for school events, ALWAYS forgot to sign up during lunch, so now I can do it at home with just a few clicks, the only thing I don't really like is that on tablets, it is either blurry or small."
1635,CLHarrison,"January 29, 2016",1,"So where's my ticket? I bought tickets on the web, and they emailed me a link. the link asks me if i want to download the app or print the tix. i say download the app. it does, then starts pestering me for info like location. i go back and click on email link. again app comes up with stupid questions. i'm glad i'm having this now instead of trying to hand my ticket to the guy at the door. Terrible."
1636,BOB62180,"February 29, 2016",4,"Convenient but.... I like the mobile app however, I am trying to delete a free ticket. I found the explanation on how to do it on my iPad but, it seems, you can't use those instructions on the mobile app! Not very helpful."
1637,Prosdaclan,"March 11, 2016",3,Addresses... This is a great service but he interface between my calendar didn't work.  And you have GOT TO insist that those creating events put in an actual address.  I've had three events in recent months that the address wasn't included in the electronic invite.
1638,Tom D. Kim,"June 3, 2016",4,"A give app that delivers on most that it promises I like simple apps that don't exceed their scope. Sure, one could ask for an app that does more, but one might as well be asking for the online service, itself to do more. This one delivers on all fronts."
1639,Kokoe,"June 14, 2016",5,Check-in is so easy So easy as a host to check people in. So as easy as a guest to keep track of tickets. No more lost paper to worry about - as long as I don't lose my phone!
1640,Jefferson sinclaire,"October 28, 2012",1,"Worthless A group of friends and I downloaded the app because it said you could view the ticket on the app and skip the will call line. When we got to the event, we were told that the app did us absolutely no good, and that we would still have to wait in line for an hour. Had we known ahead of time that this app was completely useless for this, we would have planned accordingly."
1641,WhoUsedMyName?,"June 1, 2014",5,Great service & app Been an Eventbrite user for years. Service is great. Like the iOS Passbook integration. Saw the complaint about the Outlook Calendar  integration - will have to check it for myself.

1648,Hated the event.,"March 24, 2016",1,"Buzzed art I went to an eventbrite event called buzzed, and it was the worst experience I have ever had. The picture represented on the advertisement was another picture entirely. I was told that I could paint what I wanted, then the person told me I could not have any more paint. They were rude and unresponsive, and I will never attend an event with this person again. I'm only giving one star because I have to give a star to submit."

My event was canceled due to a severe thunderstorm (it was an outdoor event) and I could not get a refund. I hadn't even entered the place so my ticket was never scanned. The event coordinator acted dumb and eventbrite doesn't step in, so buy at your own risk because your event might get canceled before you even arrive and no one will refund your money."
1650,Motley311,"January 9, 2013",5,Great App!! Lots of events including lots of legitimate free ones especially when we're looking for some quality entertainment with our 2 year old.
1651,Happyoutcome,"March 31, 2013",5,"Love this app! I just upgraded my iOS and went back to the App Store and downloaded EventBrite fresh again.  It works fine. Love the convenience and the interesting things I find to attend! Thanks, EventBrite."
1652,Ah-non-uh-muhs,"May 3, 2013",1,Useless I type in an exact address and it gives me events in the entire area and not the 5+ shows I know are happening in that building. 
1653,Lewisst,"September 12, 2013",5,"Awesome I'm new to this app but have used it about 4 times. I love it. It simplifies the event ticketing process and allows to to organize and plan for upcoming shows, conferences etc. I highly recommend it."
1654,macmanmk,"October 4, 2013",3,"Not designed for groups One shortcoming I've found is that if somebody else buys your ticket for you (e.g. social organizer for a company or a family member...), this app doesn't see the ticket at all, even though it's linked to your email address--which defeats the whole point of this app."
1655,txdkmw,"January 21, 2014",4,"Could be better The concept is great. Not as user friendly as it could be. One change would be, the ability to connect with multiple calendars."
1656,ghathm,"June 10, 2015",2,"Use the Web Page, not the app The app is not easy to use if looking for an event you know about. It places too much emphasis on what is around you or discovering new things. The app lacks various features from the web site, either missing outright or they don't work. Eventbrite is a good service but the app brings it down."
1657,mordaxus,"March 25, 2016",3,A waste. It was much easier to print a pdf than to use this app. 
1658,Sugar City,"May 23, 2016",5,Quick n Easy Quick n Easy ticket purchases.  Evenbrite is fully digital but also maintains the option to print your tickets. Love it.
1659,Chltmom,"July 14, 2016",5,Very nice! I like how you are able to easily search for items in the area as well as those surrounding! Quickly saves to the app and then to my wallet on my phone! Love iiiiiitttt!!!!!

1661,704Mac_Slim,"February 26, 2014",4,Good App I mostly use this app to buy tickets to EDM events in my area and the process has been smooth every time. My only gripe is that events that show up on the Eventbrite website do not always show up in the app.
1662,REG2013,"June 11, 2014",5,Outstanding Extremely convenient and easy to use.  A huge jump from paper tickets.
1663,Wonderpets8502,"January 24, 2015",5,Amazing App I just recently found out is was an app!! I've been missing out for a long time! It is a extremely useful and easy app. I love it and I use it constantly.
1664,layys,"May 4, 2015",3,"Easy to use app but could improve App gets the job done for me. Simple and seamless. It would be a great functionality to have a ""transfer to another Eventbrite user"" (similar to Ticketmaster). This would minimize duplicate use of tickets in the app. A developer who could do this would be great!"
1665,The Faj,"June 5, 2015",1,Needs work‚Äîpretty janky There's a lot of cruft here for ticket purchasers. The Discover tab seems like it's driven by the marketing department. Mobile tickets are disabled for nearly everything. And why does Eventbrite request access to my calendar when I try to add an event to it? That permission is only required if you're reading from the calendar‚Äîwhy would Eventbrite want to read my calendar?? Sketchy.
1666,ATesfaye,"November 28, 2015",5,Great way to find events Great way to find things going on in your area or any area you're in. Easy way to search for events and a good variety of events.
1667,Pelonsogkush,"January 9, 2016",5,Works great No need to print tickets just bring your phone they scan it that's it. I've had it for 2yrs now & I always prefer to buy tickets thru evenbrite
1668,RedinBlue,"March 30, 2016",5,"Supremely convenient How nice to be able to pull up tickets to an event just by opening the app and choosing them when you get there; great accessibility, big fan."
1669,Lemonfreeze,"April 25, 2016",4,"Digital tickets I buy tickets to local music events on here, never had an issue. The digital tickets are very useful, but the app needs better filtering when searching for events."
1670,ADG567,"February 10, 2012",3,Lacking some key features It would be better if you could actually access the site thru the app to search and register for events. It also does not add the event to the iPhone calendar. You still have to manually enter the event.
1671,Rah---zee,"September 19, 2012",5,Very convenient It is so great to have all your stuff in on place. Often you don't need to print or bring tickets if you have them in the app. Fabbolosso!
1672,Shang1971,"November 9, 2012",2,"Paid twice!! Warning!! This app does not automatically sync with your account so if you purchase tickets on a different device, you must log out and back in to see your tickets in the app!! I could not find my ticket via the app last evening and had to pay again at the door for my event."
1673,wcwhittington,"December 23, 2012",5,Don't pay attention to bad reviews! This app does EXACTLY what I would expect. It's perfect for the consumer end of ticketing. Very easy for all ages to understand when it comes to online ticketing.
1674,Garnet6106,"October 6, 2013",3,"Keeps closing The app keeps closing as I scroll through list of search results. After it happened several times in a row, I gave up checking out the app any further. Would have liked app of it worked properly. Needs fix ASAP."
1675,Bluu_dreamz,"May 12, 2014",5,"Wow I ‚ù§Ô∏è it!! This app is so cool! It's super easy to use and way more convenient than having to print out my tickets for shows and events. Plus, it saves paper which is totally cool. Thanks!"
1676,Label Destroyer,"May 23, 2014",2,Frustrating App & I work in QA Testing!! It's extremely annoying to register for an event and want to easily continue searching for more events to attend...where you left off. Nope! You have to start all over because there's no return to search results button or action menu. Disappointing process.
1677,Paul in Boston2,"December 2, 2015",5,"Great for online music tickets This app is great for music concerts. Get the tickets thru the app then show the app at the event to get in. Guaranteed space in advance no waiting in line day of event, links to calendar ."
1678,BitBoy,"January 20, 2016",5,Easy digital tickets Makes keeping all my tickets organized a breeze and getting into events simple. Digital tickets are the best!
1679,OUTSPOKEN BOO,"April 28, 2016",5,"Grate App This app is grate, always easy to find events. And have your tickets email or saved to your phone. So you won't have to keep up with any paper. Love it.."
1680,Queen of Shoes,"August 29, 2013",4,"Almost perfect... Great app! Works perfect for searching events and finding different activities! Would LOVE the next update to include selecting new events and viewing previously saved events through the app as well! Get that fifth star, Eventbrite!"
1681,Birdie B.,"December 30, 2013",5,Great app! Makes keeping track of my events simple and organized. Syncs well with the calendar to keep things running smoothly.
1682,Grhook24,"February 25, 2014",5,Never knew so many events existed This app is convenient and stores your ticket on your phone. No more paper tickets! I never knew so many great community events existed!
1683,BeckerDallas,"November 23, 2014",5,Easy to use I purchased VIP tickets quickly and easily. The tickets are stored in my account and easy to access on my iPhone. I'm really enjoying this app.
1684,NYread15,"August 18, 2015",5,Crashing I don't know what changes have been made but the app crashes all the time . At this point I can't even open it .
1685,ajredcoats78,"September 29, 2015",5,"Very convenient I love the fact that I already have my iPhone with me all the time so if I forget to bring a paper copy of a ticket, I have the app to save my bacon! üòä"
1686,K rich 2020,"December 26, 2015",4,"Pretty good Good overall, one day took to a few incorrect places but besides that day everything was good, every ticket worked, and they even give you refunds if you make the wrong order."
1687,@chadfeacher on twitter,"March 13, 2016",4,"Great for small town and big city happenings I found multiple things to do in my town and surrounding cities. There are a lot of free events, and I love how you can customize it to the categories you're into."
1688,CG10000,"April 12, 2016",5,"Works well... The events process through here is fine, no particular trouble...would be nice if app had an autofill option..."
1689,Marcy McCann,"May 19, 2016",5,Perfect Worked perfectly! I can show people at the event that I purchased the tickets on my phone and avoid wasting paper.
1690,Weigaco,"December 2, 2012",5,Easy to use Used it for an event today. Loved not having to print tickets and it worked flawlessly.
1691,Ran729,"February 6, 2013",5,"Amazing app So easy to navigate, very quick and interactive and user friendly, beautiful design and very very helpful and easy to understand , well done."
1692,reeceajibola,"January 5, 2014",4,Love it but..... The app is really a life saver but if you could somehow add a way to manager eventbrite from your phone without have the user have to go to his/her computer then that would really be great but besides that the app is wonderful.
1693,RLittledale,"May 6, 2014",5,Simple to use and keeps my events together Love it.
1694,brad.lai,"December 8, 2014",5,Great event management/ticketing service/app. There are variety events available covering all kinds of categories. The app is very easy to use. I really enjoy using it. Thank you!
1695,szhivago,"May 18, 2015",2,"I would like to give 4 or 5 stars but.. Events are not easily shown in order. A bit frustrating. It would be ideal as a default setting to see what's happening today, weekend, this month, next month, etc. Instead of Sept., June and then this weekend. Other than that I really like it so far"
1696,"Suzanna, WV","June 4, 2015",5,Love it! I love this ap. I can keep all my event and meeting tix in one spot and across devices. As long as I have my phone or iPad I have my admission. Thanks for making one thing in my life easy.
1697,Laftree 4,"October 26, 2015",5,Eventbrite I attended a function and it was done on this application and it just works. So I created my own event for a high school reunion. It's well worth it and will keep things organized 
1698,Braaaaandoon,"April 20, 2016",5,"Amazing App Festival wise this app is amazing. Can buy tickets to all these festivals, then the tickets are in the app and save to your phone as well. This app is 5 star hands down."
1699,brahim-el,"August 4, 2016",5,Point and click Haven't encountered any issues yet. Pretty much point and click. Almost too convenient.
1700,PrincessCyan,"October 7, 2012",4,Great with Minor Flaws I love it! It's very simple and easy to use. I just wish I could view my tickets in passbook instead of having to go to the seperate app. It seemed like a  waste of space to be but still very uselful.
1701,Orlandopalm,"October 10, 2012",3,DRAINS Battery on iPhone5 Used this App w/ passbook & it works great...but because of notifications in Passbook (which don't seem to turn off unless you fully & completely delete the App) battery went from 89% to 17% in less than 2 hours.
1702,Jmm782,"November 12, 2012",5,Excellent App Really user friendly. I like the ability to just use my phone and not have to worry about printing it out.
1703,ChaiLattes,"January 31, 2013",4,"Nice and useful Ok to use with surprising functionality (passbook,etc) - ""only"" 4 stars as buttons are hidden initially with keyboard, which always makes me search for them before I figure it out..."
1704,Ethan Elliott,"February 27, 2014",2,"Defaults to ""Discover"" on open- yuck. 100% of the time I open this app, it is to access a ticket I have purchased. The notion of using "

1706,Super dharsh,"October 9, 2014",5,"Need to find some local events? You've found them here Eventbrite is a fantastic App. If I'm looking for a cool event in the area, it's always my 1st look and it doesn't disappoint."
1707,Atilla.The.Pun.,"January 17, 2015",1,"Doesn't work properly. I downloaded this app to add a ticket to Passbook. The link sent in a confirmation email, which is supposed to direct me to the app in order to view the ticket, automatically sends me here instead (acts like I have yet to download the app). The event does not show up on the search list either. Pretty frustrating, it's stuck in a weird loop."
1708,pjhardy51,"November 10, 2015",5,"An easy way to register Eventbrite is an easy way to purchase tickets, to make reservations, to RSVP and to register for a variety of events. Very versatile, easy and reliable."
1709,RangeRover2006,"August 12, 2016",5,"Eventbrite App Well, I just discovered it, accidentally I might add, but am already sold on its intent.  Great job Product Manager, Product Owner and Agile Development Team! (Assumption made here on the software development methodology)"
1710,Quany Boy,"January 21, 2013",5,A guy Very helpful app takes me seconds to show people my ticket. I also don't have to worry about it being crumpled. Amazing app
1711,Habibi.BRC,"February 12, 2013",5,"Solid App This is a rock-solid app that delivers as promised. A work-horse for the club and entertainment scene benefiting all parties to the ticket transaction with integrity and accuracy, speed, and an excellent user interface. Get it!"
1712,Can brew,"August 5, 2014",3,Hard to get a refund. I like this app.  Some of The vendors/promoters who use this are questionable. I was unable to use tickets to an event due to over selling the capacity. When I asked for a refund for the tickets I wasn't allowed to use I got the runaround from the promoter and no refund.
1713,Apple7564389,"February 7, 2015",1,Zero stars Every time I try to get the ticket online it doesn't send me the link to view my ticket it sends me to the App Store even though I downloaded the app already and it just keeps doing it over and over. I would much rather just print the stupid ticket than spending more time than needed on the stupid app. How do I delete my account for this app?
1714,HunterStone,"March 9, 2015",5,Love this app Easy to find events and purchase tickets.  It is great that Eventbrite interfaces with Passbook so tickets are at your fingertips - no more lost or forgotten paper tickets!!
1715,Dookie 2x,"June 17, 2015",1,Where's ApplePay? I downloaded the app to register and pay for an event via Ô£øPay and nope. It's totally old school requiring card info. I see nowhere to use Ô£øPay. It's frustrating that the description would mention Ô£øPay and the app would be categorized with apps that truly support Ô£øPay and then it does not make it available for purchasing event tickets.
1716,MrsKJGraham,"July 1, 2015",5,Love it!! I've used Eventbrite for OVER 3 years now and it meets my needs. I'm able to edit my search options and find exactly what I'm looking for!!!

1718,Evillincoln,"June 16, 2016",3,"When it works it's awesome... I'm having an issue with events not showing up on the app. I'll buy the ticket, receive the email, click the link which opens the app & nothing. No ticket. Strange. When it does work though, it's fantastic."

1720,stupefly,"September 25, 2012",2,"No support for purchases on your behalf The mobile app--perhaps Eventbrite in general--can't associate tickets purchased for you (i.e., associated with and sent to your email address) if someone else made the purchase. The ticketing email suggests using the mobile app to access tickets but this isn't possible."
1721,Yani smechcov,"January 22, 2013",4,Pretty good but still some bugs I really enjoy the app except some of my tickets don't show up on my app library. I can see the ticket on my email and website but not the app.

1726,tjmcneice,"August 18, 2015",1,What a POS Ordered tickets online via eventbrite and wanted to get them on my phone using this app. The instructions to access the tickets on the app were out of date and didn't match what I was seeing on the app... Then when I go to search for the event it can't be found even though I found the exact destination on the app. Unhelpful and a waste of time.
1727,Quicksilver0587,"April 15, 2016",5,"I'm happy with it! Well, I haven't received a waiting status or had a problem yet, but in the meantime, I'm gonna give this a 5. Easy to use!"

1729,RedAppleMom,"June 19, 2016",3,"Ticket leap is better Purchased tickets for myself and a friend. In Ticketleap I can send the ticket to my friend so he can have it on his phone for check-in. Not so Eventbrite, unless I missed something. So we have to go into the event together. Not always convenient."

1770,FBF-GVA,"May 11, 2012",4,Works good I like the app and so far it works well on my iPhone. How about adding a function to download the event in you calendar? That would avoid typing it in everything.
1771,dongdongsj,"October 8, 2012",5,Great passbook integration It's nice to see Eventbrite to jump on the latest iOS 6 feature so quickly!!!!!
1772,Samurai Broker,"December 1, 2012",5,Smart app Have used this as a guest for a while but am using now for my own events. Very easy to use and its proactive prompts to promote my event are a bonus. Nice work guys.
1773,Freshfer,"October 21, 2014",5,"Wont open Ever since i updated eventbrite, it keeps closing when I try and open it. Please fix!!!"
1774,Tabo.pr,"February 8, 2015",4,Recommended Real handy for universtiy students. It helped me access the activities I required for my internship project and it also helps me identify activities i would like to assist back home.
1775,7890jake,"February 21, 2015",1,"App or website or both is worthless Keep getting in a loop when trying to reset password. Says email sent to confirm, click on link in email, told to create a new password. "
1776,Frankie 137,"July 18, 2015",5,Always something to do I love the fact that you can never be bored
1777,lmvb23,"August 5, 2015",4,"Great Idea The app is great, just wish there were more professional events that are relevant to my business. Couldn't give 5 stars cause all the events are in NYC. Wish there were more in NJ."

1780,James Scheinblum,"December 18, 2011",5,Solid alternative to paper tickets Perfect alternative to trying to fumble with the printer to print out tickets. Printing at home is a pain!
1781,Saabtech,"February 23, 2013",5,"Eventbrite If you need to buy event tickets online, worry no more. It just plain works. And sends ticket to iOs passbook."
1782,Cetorio,"October 14, 2013",2,Could be better Doesn't list all or even most of the upcoming events in the area. It would also be a much better app if it added a website link to the event to help customers gather more info about the event before purchasing tickets.
1783,daedaluz,"October 29, 2013",5,"Works Beautifully Well designed, works great and I love the passbook integration! Can't stand when people don't use Eventbrite."

1785,RCKWeddings,"July 18, 2014",5,Love it! I'm an event/wedding planner and I was put in charge of my high school reunion's guest list and to collect money. It was so easy for my classmates to use and pay for their tickets
1786,Shunabun,"August 10, 2014",3,Good but basic It needs a way to save and get notifications from your favorite planners and to save events without Facebook. It would also help to store default city and event types. But it is very user friendly.
1787,Joyrains,"August 26, 2014",5,"Great resource I appreciate being able to find other events that are happening in my community, my profession, and socially. Great app!"
1788,MACF2014,"June 1, 2016",5,Love it Even though I've only used it a handful of times it's so convenient not to have to print anything!!

1797,javajenni,"July 3, 2015",5,Favorite Event App! Other event apps either don't have Sacramento events or it's out dated. I have not purchased tickets yet. Just want to know what's going on.
1798,Libratsie,"August 6, 2015",1,"Horrid! Although I've used it fine to display tickets in the past, I got to an event a few days ago and the app would start to open, then shut down. I rebooted my phone which didn't help. Fortunately, they had a printed list of all who'd purchased tickets or I'd have been out the money. Others had similar issues,"
1799,Ariasx8,"November 19, 2015",3,"Great app but couple kinks Great app that's overall easy to use. There are a few kinks to edit the name of ticket holders or it freezes while adding to passbook, but the hardest is vendors don't scan the ticket on phone to show redeemed."
1800,DJ Deckard,"October 18, 2012",5,Nice app Works great. Tickets appear quickly and saves having to download and print them up.
1801,DaRawC808,"April 14, 2013",4,"App works nice App works nice, just need more vendors to participate (in hawaii) to make it that much more valuable to have. Purchased my 1st ticket to a show less than 24 goes after downloading the app! "

1806,Positive lyrics,"February 29, 2016",5,Great app I must confess this is a very user friendly app and for sure helps to promote events you intend to activate across networks. Great monitoring profile as it relates to enrollment to your event in a nutshell it's awesome.
1807,BrwnStarAngel,"March 4, 2016",5,Efficient This is a wonderful app. Search for tickets has never been so easy.
1808,Robert Rupp,"March 25, 2016",1,App done by some 12 year old in their garage If you need help..forget it    We typed in incorrect email...showed it didn't go thru.  So we ordered a gaining thinking we didn't get charged.  We got charged..went to help...says create an account using typo d email..  Then go to email we sent you.  How can you go to an email that doesn't exist ü§ì

Still can't get them to refund my money... A month later. They can't seem to figure out to credit my credit card. They had no problem figuring out how to charge it, though!"
1813,Maria 7364884,"June 7, 2013",4,Dates I feel this is a great app but I wish it was organized by dates. The dates are all over the place & it drives me crazy not being able to plan ahead!!
1814,Klpo6),"July 9, 2013",5,"Works great Useful for finding local events. App runs smoothly, never crashes."
1815,Valjones,"March 24, 2014",4,Event Brite Easy enough to use. Luv the interface for adding my tickets to my passbook on iPhone. My event is a few weeks out. I will be keeping printed tickets in my purse.

1822,Grandmister,"January 25, 2013",3,"Upcoming events don't register This is generally a handy app, but upcoming events do not register!  You have to log out and then log back in to see an event that you've just signed up for through Eventbrite."
1823,FallenStar1,"June 7, 2013",2,Stop with the reminders I downloaded it for an event I RSVPd for. Even though I have notifications turned off I kept getting a notification for the event even after the event passed. I finally had to delete the app to stop the annoying reminders.

1829,Heaven94606,"May 28, 2016",2,"Search Function Doesn't Work The app is cool, but the search function is completely USELESS. I get emails about events you need to purchase or register through Eventbrite and maybe 2 out of 7 searches will I find the event. Don't believe me? Search for 'Sausage Fest' in Oakland."
1830,Glitterspygirl,"December 21, 2011",5,"Best app! Love being able to have all my tickets stored in one place. Such an impressive display and easy to use! Thanks, Eventbrite!! :)"
1831,Addict2Freshnez,"December 23, 2012",5,"Love It Cool app, never notice how many events that are setup through this app..no need to print out paper...just show my phone, and I'm in!! Lol"
1832,TwoCreeks,"February 26, 2013",4,Madly cool mobile Eventbrite's app is very cool - there IS a lag on updating - registered for an event on laptop but it was like an hour before it popped up in the app on iPhone so register for stuff as early as you can.
1833,Dkewl,"June 10, 2013",3,Limited but functional The app does exactly what I would expect. The only feature missing is the ability to manage more than one account.
1834,cksworld,"June 24, 2013",3,"wish the follow thru was better I like the purchasing part of it, but once I have the ticket it doesn't show up in ""My Tickets"". that's bad!  Weirdly enough, it shows up in the Passport app from Apple. thank God for that."

1839,Zpad2,"April 16, 2015",2,Search feature is weak If you use the discovery mode there's no ability to sort by date. This makes the mode almost useless. The search feature doesn't allow you to save filters.
1840,Chewbaby3,"March 16, 2012",5,Excellent Simple and intuitive UI. It does what it advertises and does it well. More apps should have this level of usefulness.

1847,Couch Potata,"March 29, 2015",3,"Refund say what? Buyer beware! Easy to use, great way to find things to do in local area. No management of vendors or return policy.

1866,dezcolley,"December 5, 2015",1,"Terrible Online and App based system! One of the worst apps as far as loading, coordination between the website and the app. Using it online is just  as bad as using the app. Drop down selections will not appear, as well as updates on the tickets in the app. The ""Manage Wrispband"" dropdown wont help you at all."
1867,JJahnay,"January 15, 2016",5,Love it! I love the convenience of this app and having all of my tickets in the palm of my hand. So glad I downloaded it.

1874,Rich That Kid,"December 10, 2014",4,Eventbrite Not a bad app. It gives you good ideas. I recommend constantly checking up on it due to free tickets going fast.
1875,An iPad novice,"December 23, 2014",1,"Doesn't actually work Bought tix for an event and then downloaded this app. However it's not intuitive how you get your tix unless you buy them through the app, and when trying to access my tix it just hangs and doesn't log in.

1909,Vortech,"August 1, 2016",2,Apple Pay broken I downloaded the app just for Apple Pay support and it is broken. Displays a message that there is missing information. Same information works fine if you punch in a cc.
1910,acdha,"July 31, 2012",1,"Needs to handle corporate travel My tickets were booked by someone else. Unfortunately there's no way to load anything without the email & password used to place the order, even though they correctly delivered the PDF to my email address"
1911,Manders123456,"December 6, 2012",5,Easy! I love the easy access of tickets once you put them into Passbook. Pretty cool :)
1912,Lopey 39512,"February 25, 2015",3,The basics In terms of keeping stuff organize they tend to do pretty good job.  Wish they would change the colors of the ticket so you could identify them individually differently
1913,Houston10,"October 30, 2015",4,Needs only one thing for me Y'all need to update to support Wallet and not Passbook! I can't add any of my tickets to my phone anymore üòê
1914,MilahJiggly,"November 18, 2015",1,EventBrite Terrible Terrible!!!!!! We had plan our class reunion through eventbrite. Things did not goes as plan and so we had to cancel so Eventbrite guarantee our money back WE NEVER GOT OUR MONEY. Then lied and said that we did???? Mmmmm horrible establishment BEWARE!!!!!!!!!

1915,Taintonmyface,"November 20, 2015",5,Great app Great app for discovering events. Wish there was more options for my area though.
1916,rdoubleu,"December 5, 2015",4,It's improved It finally can automatically go to the app if I get an eventbrite link somewhere ands it's soooo smooth. You are appreciated
1917,Sisuchickie,"March 11, 2016",4,"Works great! We use Eventbrite for our annual memorial run. The app makes it very easy to register, and share information about the run"
1918,Wasteofmytime 187654321,"March 25, 2016",1,"Doesn't work Signed up for an event ticket, and it registered me with Eventbrite. It asked me to download the app, which I did. It won't allow me to sign up, as I have a ticket, but I can't sign it because I don't have a password... It keeps saying ""Woops! We can't send you an email"" to provide me with a password."
1919,USdiner,"June 28, 2016",1,"Terrible I put in my ticket info moments after a popular event opened sales. I was stuck in ""hold"" and thought I was i.n a que.  After 30 min. The event sold out, but there I was hanging on to hope I was going to get tickets and only 2 tickets were supposedly allowed per person.  Oh well."
1920,JCUV,"December 26, 2011",2,What happened to event organizer functionality? I just updated the app but now I cannot see the events I created with check-ins and stats like I used to as the event organizer. I only see my own personal tickets. Am I missing something??
1921,spiceynice,"December 24, 2012",2,Disappointing and aggravating I had high hopes...
1922,RameshBabu,"March 19, 2013",1,Disappointing No work email integration and hence you are forced to have two profiles. Hence you can't see tickets connected to your work id. Why should I switch on location services to find events?  Why can't it be based on the name of city?  UI needs major improvements.
1923,Cheapeats Inc,"April 9, 2013",4,‚ù§ It This app is an easy way to access events & your tix frm your mobile. Only complaint is u hve to log out & in for your new tix to update.

1934,terrisriley,"February 22, 2016",1,Useless for Event Organizers The features needed don't exist in the mobile app. It was a complete waste of time to release an app that doesn't meet user requirements. There's no way to copy a link to your event.

1946,Jev086,"January 9, 2014",4,"Easy to use Nice, simple, easy to use app. All I need sent right to phone upon purchase, what more can you ask for?"

1974,VictorSF,"June 16, 2015",1,"Terrible customer service Paid for 2 tickets to an event that did nothing. People working the event didn't even recognize the tickets.

1999,Trescrwn,"July 28, 2016",1,"Awful I registered 10 events for a conference. So I wouldn't have to add all 10 one at a time, I  added them to my iCal. Instead of adding each of the 10 workshops Eventbrite added 1 workshop with the first date and time and last date and time. Ridiculous."
2000,bythec1,"July 21, 2012",1,"Could be a good app, BUT... Despite the app saying that there were over 2000 events in the San Francisco Bay area, once you apply a filter - ANY filter - the message comes up saying there are no events. I tried MULTIPLE filters and got the exact same message.  "

2003,UlyssesC,"March 31, 2013",1,Eventbrite Mobile App I found this to be an exceptionally poor application.  I downloaded it to my iPhone to check in attendees at an event.  When I logged in the app failed to recognize me as the event organizer. I also found the application was geared towards attending an event.  Perhaps there should be an app for organizers.
2004,Davidbrewer,"May 8, 2013",5,"Tickets Worked great, both times I used it."

2009,N-S-01,"April 25, 2016",1,Useless App If I could give this app a -5 I would. I did get my ticket to the Ted Cruz Event held here. Told me I needed a new password and then told me I had an account already with my email. I couldn't get my ticket and I was not allowed into the event because of it. I'll never use this app again period!
2010,DoesMyOpionMatter,"October 8, 2012",1,"Misleading In the description Eventbrite says you can create, promote and sell tickets.

2054,Concol83,"January 25, 2014",1,Awful Bought tickets for show tonight. Site won't let me use mobile app for tickets. Have to try and find somewhere to print them now. Site requires pw reset and just says Oops we couldn't reset your pw try again later!  Waste of time.
2055,Alsandler,"August 22, 2014",5,Great app for finding and attending events Love how easy it makes going to Eventbrite events.

2057,Former growlr user,"June 7, 2016",1,"Terrible app So much more difficult to navigate than it should be, also impossible to change payment information and it does correctly save information."
2058,Redrobinsnest,"July 4, 2016",4,Seems good! Easy to use This works well so far. Nice to have tickets on my phone.
2059,bball.musicluvr25,"August 15, 2016",1,"Saved events I'm not sure if it's a bug with the update, but only one saved event can show at a time; all previous ""saved"" events are no longer saved once a new event is bookmarked. This erases almost all use for the app in my opinion."
2060,Unr student,"March 28, 2013",1,"Can't sync invites from email When invited to an even under my email that the account is signed in under, it doesn't show up in the app so I can't click to attend. Not being able to do that makes the app useless for me."
2061,mhambrecht,"May 7, 2014",5,Cool Finally something I can use to find cool local events
2062,jkirk1626,"August 14, 2014",5,Solid. Passbook support is sufficient to get this. Does what it's supposed to.  Reliable & well done.
2063,Swizoop,"December 31, 2014",1,"Doesn't work Purchased tickets via mobile site but when I went to retrieve them via this app, my login attempt would just hang. Worthless for me, I had to print out tickets which was not convenient for my situation."
2064,Jack who loves the Ryder cup,"January 27, 2015",5,Nice app I use it for several monthly events and it works great!
2065,myoshio1,"April 15, 2015",1,Scam This app sold me tickets for an event that had already taken place 2 months prior. They would not refund my money. Anyone can create an event and sell tickets without there being an actual event. I would never use this app again
2066,Darrell frm Dallas,"July 4, 2015",5,No issues at all. It's a pretty good app have 0 issues.

2076,Tonetest,"May 10, 2015",1,"Wastes time, just an ad platform All I want is the tickets I just bought- no interest in ""joining"" yet another spam-ad, clutter-filled, push-notifying promotional platform. So anytime an event uses Eventbrite to distribute their tickets, I download the app, print the tix on paper, and uninstall it again."
2077,kdog2002,"September 28, 2015",5,App works great This app has worked perfect for me. Passbook integration is excellent!

2080,ToughBastahD,"April 18, 2012",3,"Good app. Works nice, too bad you can't search and register for events right on the app, you have to go to their website for that. Good app, works great, but dumb concept."
2081,paulite31,"July 7, 2012",5,Great! The app does exactly what it says. Works great for mobile ticket purchases!
2082,Ducktor03,"May 26, 2013",4,"Ducktor Easy to use. Stores tickets; easy to check for upcoming engagements, for the most part."

2089,Timminer,"August 18, 2016",1,"Still waiting After a few hours, still waiting for the phone based app to show my tickets as I have them on the desktop. New technology using an old modem? Got to be a better way!"
2090,suusteve,"October 4, 2012",2,Good I like that it can be put into passbook. It's really annoying that the notification won't go away until after the event. Please fix that soon!
2091,gazz87,"October 14, 2012",2,Not for me. The app works great and it's easy to use but it seems like it only brings up workshops and charity events. Also I think you should be able to filter by type of event.
2092,River brewer,"January 17, 2013",5,Happy This app does everything I wanted and more
2093,Eventbrite user,"July 29, 2013",4,"Great app, but needs more Would be better if you cud create events from this app as well."

2103,J.D.ACES,"November 23, 2013",4,Works like a charm. An app that does what is advertises.  I don't think I use all the bells and whistles but I don't need to.  How I use it works great for me.

2105,Jerry cates,"May 18, 2015",3,Work It needs more work I am not getting it to work on the iPhone but can on other items I have.
2106,Cycle4life53,"August 18, 2015",2,"Additional Functionality Needed As a smart phone app its ok, but not easy (depending on who sets up the invite) to add to your calendar. When will the tablet version be out? tired of looking at this sideways on my iPad:)"
2107,roxanneroxyrox,"September 16, 2015",1,Fraudulent charges!!! Used this app to purchase tickets to a festival and within minutes had thousands of dollars of fraudulent charges in my account from all over the world!!! Do not enter your credit card info on this app!!!

2110,Fletchd,"May 17, 2012",1,Shouldn't need an app Forcing customers to download an app so that they can access mobile tickets is a terrible business decision. I can't wait to erase this app from my phone. Seems about in line with the terrible handling of large scale ticket sales.
2111,Idlecpu,"July 18, 2012",5,Best app for events! This app rocks!  Very useful and a good place to check often.

2117,Ryanw423,"March 24, 2015",1,"Had to download to get into a sxsw show. I don't like this product and only downloaded it to get in to a sxsw show. It's another lame app with annoying passwords, so I immediately deleted it. As I'm sure everybody else did who had to download it for the show."
2118,dpinkus,"June 1, 2015",1,"Garbage.  Doesn't login.  Use the web site. Login doesn't work, yet you can send a password reset email, which doesn't matter because you can't use the old password, new password, or any password to login."
2119,James27502,"June 6, 2016",2,Poor event search I have the hardest time getting this app to find an event even when I search on the exact name or date.  They really need to provide advanced search filtering.
2120,N√∏lff,"July 23, 2012",2,"Needs work It would be nice to arrange events in chronological order. If there is a way, it's hard to figure out. "
2121,34ekek,"November 28, 2012",5,Great app. Love that it gets rid of the need to print your tickets
2122,Oaklandnewsguy,"April 17, 2013",2,Too slow! Takes way too long before tickets for confirmed event make their way to Passbook. Should be instantaneous and not require iterative returns to the site.
2123,Gumble1012,"September 7, 2013",5,Eventbrite! I think this app is fun and easy to use. It is the best ticket app out there!

2136,Ladybug254,"January 4, 2016",1,"Poor This app is not ideal for the event organizers other than scanning tickets you can't do much else as it relates to your event. You can't edit the event, can't get the event url to send to someone to register overall just a poor app for organizer."
2137,rswaf86,"February 3, 2016",4,Good app This app works for me. I have used it on a number of occasions without any problems.
2138,1234grindr,"March 16, 2016",1,"Horrible Recommendations App works ok to register for an event, but fails with recommendations for events. There is no way to give a thumbs up or down to the massive number of irrelevant and uninteresting events it recommends to you or to delete them. Massive fail on that part of the app!"

2148,Kacediggity,"August 2, 2015",1,Horrible This app is a waste of time. I didn't want to print my tickets so I downloaded this ridiculous app. Took 4 emails and then I couldn't connect to their servers?! What a waste of time. Print your tickets or use a different app

2166,MRAHART,"February 18, 2015",1,Events And Money The App is ok but I would be careful about giving them money for a event. I purchased tickets from them and they cancelled and are blaming it on another company so won‚Äôt give any of the ticket buyers their money back. Seems like a scam to me.
2167,10sjoec,"August 18, 2015",1,"Terrible app. Doesn't work Has the developer tested this app? It doesn't work. When you set a password, you need to ask for confirmation just in case the user makes a typo. This is basic and it is not in the app. Bad app."

Apple Pay has been available to third-party developers for years now, and still no support? As a professional iOS developer, I know for a fact that implementing Apple Pay support is really easy, so I can only assume that Eventbrite management is totally clueless. If I have to get up, find my wallet, type in my credit card number, expiration date, security code, address, etc... 9 times out of 10, I‚Äôm just not gonna do it. It just isn‚Äôt worth it.

A small but growing event that I fund-personally (appx 150-200guest) To put together this event I have to hire security, stage hands, set up and breakdown persons, sound, photographers etc. Because I don‚Äôt have a large budget I depend on Eventbrite sales to pay my workers and reimburse me for monies paid out. On the website it states that my payout (after their fees are taken out) would be transferred to my account in 4-5 business days. Based on their quoted time that would mean at the latest I would b paid out Thursday or Friday of that week. That is the same timetable I gave my staff for pay out. When Thursday and Friday came I checked my account it wasn‚Äôt there. I didn‚Äôt get the courtesy of them reaching out in a phone call or email to let me know that they would b paying out my money to me After the time frame I was quoted. Instead I had to call them Only to be told that my money ‚Äòshould‚Äô be paid out to me ‚Äòno later‚Äô then Wednesday of the next week (8 business days)ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThis puts me In a Jam bc it makes me look flakey to my hardworking staff and disappoints all of our plans bc of the lie and lack of diligence on Eventbrite‚Äôs end. Then what made it even worse is when I asked to speak to a supervisor I was put on hold for over 30min(No exaggeration) until I decided to hang up and right this review, to WARN others and be heard. If their are any other online ticket companies for events (Ticketmaster, Shopify etc) please let me know... I would rather try another company Instead of being Mislead and Played by Eventbrite Again. By the way it‚Äôs 7days later and I still haven‚Äôt gotten an explanation from a supervisor or the funds from our great event from Eventbrite.

Not the case. We were able to get into the event with zero problem. If you are reading this and laughing, you are probably in your 30s or younger.
