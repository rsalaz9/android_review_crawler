0,Hix|,"April 30, 2020",4,"Update Ideas So i think the app is really good but i would just like to make a few requests like when you hold the button for a longer time the video zooms in. Another one could be like there are more filters like doggy, glitch, and other cooler filters. Also I think one of the updates should be that you can duet other people's dubs. Ohh and i think you guys should also let us pick how long we what the video to go until it pauses, do u guys get what i mean? And we should also be able to change the video voice, and pick how long we want the captions to show until. Thank you, sorry if i said to much, i would really appreciate if you made those changes. Again thank you. If you can, can u pls let the sounds go a bit longer than 20 seconds, it should go like to 1 minute at least. Also can you Please Please fix the block people thing and not have a limitation because I think there is a glitch and its not letting me block anybody, and I am getting frustrated can u plss make like a green screen thing, like there is a photo it the background, but its a greenscreen, and some new filters, like a doggy face, a which Disney princessnce are u, etc, it would mean a lot"
1,ilovebillieeyelash 😋,"April 13, 2020",1,"PARENTS PLEASE READ THIS! this app is a lot of fun! You can dance, and have a great time! But adults are also on this app..... so sexual predators are all over the children. You can use this app to text people (that you DONT know!) and it’s very scary to think that millions of kids that DO have this app are possibly being harassed by a predator. This app should be much much more organized and you NEED to make sure the kids on here are safe!!! People on this app, twerk, show inappropriate parts of there body on camera, use  sexual assault with comments, online date, do sexting, verbal abuse, and the kids who are the “pretty ones” not only get wayyy to much attention from these sexual predators but so do the younger children that use this app! Children that have been sexually abused by predators usually don’t tell anyone because they don’t know how the person will react or if they will get in trouble. Especially for the children that are traumatized or are already traumatized. Don’t let this be your child, or your self. Nobody here that is a good mother or father would want this for there children! KEEP SOCIAL APPS AWAY FROM KIDS UNTILL YOU KNOW THEY ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE!"
2,May.034,"November 27, 2019",3,Read this!!!!!!! Hey i’m new to this app and i love it!!There ls just a few things i need to say. 1st off some things are inappropriate to see and yeah you know what i mean. If people post those stuff they should get kicked off immediately. Also no songs with cuss words to make it more kid friendly. It makes kids think it’s ok then they get in trouble from there parents for saying them. Also there should be different speeds to do with the songs like fast or slow. I think you should make a Dubsmash app for KIDS!!! it would be awesome. Parents would be way more comfortable with kids having this app and kid friendly songs like High School musical or just fun things but also have songs with no cuss words and are fun to do even with tweens and teens. The age limit should be 8-14. I would want that app way more. So please keep this in mind!!!! I really hope you use these ideas to improve this app and it be way more fun for kids!!
3,Razii03,"January 10, 2020",4,"Update and Fix It is a fun app that kills time and has helped me learn new dances and make connections with friends. Though it could use some updates because it's the same as it has been for years. Also I’m having trouble with the sounds, when I try to play a sound it either glitches or doesn’t work. Is there anyway you can fix it?"
4,nkhnlhnku,"December 1, 2019",5,Fix I love this app with all my life but this new update needs to go I love the format and how you can see the hidden dubs but now I can even put it on private it’s either I post or I have to save it and delete it which I highly dislike and also i can’t even save my own dubs and I don’t like the messaging thing I can’t see who like my post or anything so if this can be fixed that would be great if it went back to the old ways where we can save them to private or just save them and take all the extra stuff out would be great old way was much better only thing I like about this new update is that the private and the posted videos are separate please take this into consideration pleas and thank you
5,YeetDawwg,"February 17, 2020",5,i like the app but... the app is really good but could be better with improvments
6,khikhi😁😁😘,"January 2, 2020",5,"To dubsmash creators Omg I love dubsmash so much and I use it almost everyday but since yesterday it started messing up I couldn’t watch videos,listen to sounds, or even post videos. I was so upset 😖. So I tried again today and it didn’t work. So I tried to delete it and download it again but it isn’t downloading and i have enough space on my device for me to download dubsmash, but the main problem is that it isn’t letting me do my dances or watch others. But otherwise dubsmash is a wonderful dancing app I consider sending the link to your friends because I have put mine on dubsmash but yes please fix these bugs and glitches."
7,liberty. giana,"December 23, 2019",4,"Dubsmash is a magnificent app I love dubsmash but sometimes the music has a lot of cussing in it but it is a lit app for only 11 - 14 I like it so far sometimes the music is inappropriate for kids I think little kids like 6-8 should not be on the app but that is up to their parents so not trying to be in other people’s bissness so I like the app it is ok who ever created this app did ok with creating it for  11-14 again only for this is what I said only for 11-14 if you want to feel the experience go ahead and check it out for your self remember I am not trying to be in others peoples bissnes remember be the one to help others dubsmash be your own hero sincerely,liberty to dubsmash love your app"
8,Matt Matt LOL,"January 24, 2020",4,Slomo OK I don’t really write reviews because most of my games and other apps are good but the only thing bad about this is delete slow mode because most of the songs that people put in there is used to be slow oh yeah and if they should have fast mode to but I’m not really into that right now so yeah. Another thing you should block inappropriate text because in this app there’s lotta inappropriate stuff that I know little kids have it just saying because so almost everybody those little kids have it because of there big sisters and brothers so I’m just saying you should put some blocking of  putting a inappropriate words in there and tha is it
9,HUMBLE R,"January 9, 2020",5,"Dubsmash I have this app on my phone and two tablets and am on it basically everyday!! I enjoy the app a lot and one of the pluses is the Dubs are so clean compared to the lyrics in the sounds! But lately I have started to see an increase in inappropriate profile pics and an issue with reporting them! The last two times I had to report the profiles via reporting the bug about the reporting not working right! This is an important bug to fix, especially at a time when many apps are having to update their Terms and Conditions!!! Other then that this is one of my favorite apps right now!!"
10,maddielicioustx,"December 20, 2018",4,"Good but some things need to be changed I think Dub smash is amazing! But I think it should notify you if someone you have followed has made a dub and if someone follows you. And before the update there were so many inappropriate sounds made by dub smash I was like whaaaat?. I think you should also be able to chat with your friends on it.( but if y’all do that then make sure bad words are turned in to $,&,@,#etc) and just one more thing I think you should be able to make your dubs in fast or slow motion. Thanks for reading my review. Btw great app"
11,Gabbi.O,"January 5, 2019",5,"Dumbsmash Is Decent I really like the new update. It feels like an instagram page. It’d be better if we could comment on each other’s dubs instead of only liking and viewing. There should also be a way to repost saved dubsmashes. Like sometimes I’ll make a dance and then save it to my camera roll, and decide that I’m going to redo it. But then I can’t post the camera roll ones because it would be gone. There should be an option to save them in like a folder after recorded for future posts. Besides that it’s a good app. 😎!"
12,rb4rings,"January 13, 2019",4,"Edited review I am very happy with the new changes Dubsmash made with being able to save to camera roll and being able to scroll through all dubs instead of watching them all to get to one. However, my new only issue is that we have to make videos public for our friends to see. I don’t really want to make my videos public, but how else can I show my other friends on dub? If you could bring back the old feature where friends can see your dubs or you can send dubs to friends without them being on public, that would be great."
13,tøp died,"February 25, 2019",2,Eh So I’ve had the app before and it was a lot of fun to do like movie quotes or like Tik Tok memes and vines. I liked the way the feed was with the videos of the actual show on my feed like it would say “cardi b’s awesome moments “ and then it would show vids of her saying the quotes u could dub. No offense but now it’s trashed with ten year olds dubbing to songs about twerking and drugs and a whole bunch of people trying to dance to rap songs and tryna be gang members. Pls fix it and put the feed back up like how it was. I don’t care if the people still dance to the rap songs I just don’t wanna see it- thanks tbh I low key hate the app now. Not tryna be rude but it’s basically the worst app ever it worse than Tik Tok it’s ten year old kids twerking to songs about sex
14,gkjkdrhh,"March 31, 2019",5,My account back Look I really like the app but I forgot my password my account name was omgthats_fatfat and I have 5 followers please just tell me my password I know that it was in responsible of me to forget my password like that but please get me into my account I’m begging you please please please tell me my password or get me back into my account and again my account name is omgthats_fatfat I’m a good kid I’m 14 have a kid please get me back into my account or tell me my password          
15,Honest889👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻,"September 25, 2019",4,"Pretty good, but a few suggestions. Dubsmash is a really awesome app and I enjoy making videos on it. Regardless, I think there could be some improvements. I prefer dubsmash as an app to tiktok but I think Dubsmash should update the recording format like TikTok. I think there should be a recording speed because some of the dances on the app are fun but very fast. As well as a timer for where to stop recording. As well as the ability to add photos/videos from the camera roll. One more thing, I wish you could have an option for a private account so only certain people can follow you. That would be great !Thanks for reading my suggestions!"
16,Hard and Fun!!!,"August 12, 2019",4,"Great BUT: Ok i love dubsmash its so fun! In some cases some of the content is a little inappropriate, but i just steer away from that. WHAT I WISH is that you can have and option for certain speeds, like a slow mo vid or a fast vid, or you can do slow regular and fast all in one vidio. Also, i wish you can type ceartin things for cearthing segmints, like one segment it can be: HI! And the next it can be: My name is _____ . I think that would make the app way more fun. Also, mAybe you can have it so you can add effects, and different filters for a segmant. I would like it if we can see the filters while we film too. Other than that, this is a great app!"
17,_Ava_D,"March 6, 2020",4,"Fun App This app is so fun. I like the new update where you can change the speed it’s recording at. One thing I think would make the app better is if you could set a time in the middle of the sound for it to stop recording without you having to press the button. Also could you maybe make a feature where you have to accept somebody for them to be able to send you messages? I know that you have to have them follow you and you follow them back for someone to be able to message you, but I would still like a feature like that. Well overall this is a really great and fun app!! 😁👍"
18,Zhanaé,"March 13, 2020",4,"The app is fyee🔥,but...... I love dubsmash so much. It allows you to express yourself and be you. It lets you step out of reality and be creative. Although, if you forget your password it doesn’t send a link to your gmail. I have a new account but I would like to delete my old videos from my other account. But I can’t do so because of the link. I’ve tried multiple times to reset the link but it won’t send anything. I even tried to re-download the app and it’s not working. I hope that you could find a resolution to my problem."
19,slomo vid take down,"May 1, 2020",3,Mmm no . honestlyy i loved dubsmash for the longest but now they took the most popular filter out and added these ugly ones . and now it takes FOREVER for a video to save . i made a video and its still downloading and i can not watch it until its done and i already deleted it from my camera roll sooo.. and i hate the fact that it saves to your camera roll i wish they gave you a choice if we want it saved to your camera roll cause my dad can see my stuff anddd wheww please fix it !!! and the app kinda slow 🤦🏼‍♀️. but other that that its a really cool app like dubsmash the original .
20,Mlg3137,"December 8, 2018",3,"Come on guys, keep it coming! This app is awesome!! But I think part of the reason why people have forgotten about it is because it hasn’t progressed or evolved. Lately it’s been having so much trouble. It’d be great to have a little more control on the things we can create. 10 seconds is never enough for some funny scenes. And the search tool could also be so much better. Like someone was saying, separate users from actual sounds. "
21,amyzzk,"January 13, 2019",2,"Not Enough Movie / TV Quotes I love this app, but it seems that it caters more towards the dancers with all the music. I miss the old dubsmash where you had tons and tons of movie/ tv show/ celebrity quotes instead, I feel like it’s highly lacking in this section. I really really miss the variety of categories as well, as options for us to scroll through instead of having to search (like specifically a chick flick category, reality tv category, etc) The search is nice to have but I remember the old dubsmash from two years ago was much more thorough and had more variety. PLS bring back more non-music!"
22,fleekgirl123,"January 30, 2019",4,We need friends plsssssss❗️❗️ For the most part Dubsmash is really nice I use Dubsmash a lot and they have a variety of songs and dances but I don’t know if I’m the only one with this problem but I can’t seem to find my friends the old Dubsmash before the update I could find my friends and search for them but now I can’t find the friends I had before and I can’t search for friends and when I checked the help thing in the app it said it was still in progress so I’m confused 🤷‍♀️ on why we can’t find friends 👭
23,slayy_rhi,"July 12, 2019",3,"It’s GOOD BUT HAS BAD MOMENTS I love the app . I get to express myself with others of my dancing I love dancing and real people actually see it and like my post one this app it is amazing but right now there’s this update where you can’t save your videos anymore and I love to just have my videos in my camera roll to myself I know your can save it privately on your page . But I just can show my videos to people easier and post it on other social medias and express my dancing on there . No hate or anything , but would love if Dubsmash would add back saving videos to your camera roll . "
24,💜💟Symphoney💟💜,"December 26, 2019",3,Never saves🙁 and now isn’t working Dubsmash is a awesome app we’re your able to socialize and dance.😊 but although if you are trying to make a Dubsmash and you didn’t finish and you go back later the Dubsmash Doesn’t save and you haft to start over again😭! Please fix this problem!!! I also have told some of my friends that Dubsmash isn’t working and that the videos won’t pop up... and they all said that it isn’t working for them either I don’t know what’s wrong but this needs to stop if I’m gonna keep making Dubsmash’s! Fix this problem!!😒
25,rickiyaa,"July 11, 2019",5,"too short i love dubsmash its just the audio amount is to short I think it should be longer or be able to make the audio longer cuz when people are making challenge the audio amount is to short && you can’t do the challenge cuz it probably be like 15 seconds && it only can be 10 , you should make it longer cuz people are starting to use funimate cuz of how long you can make your videos && challenges .."
26,lelethegamer1383,"October 25, 2019",3,"It’s good but has flaws So I had Dubsmash for a long time since I was in 6th grade and so I wanted to post my old videos on my instagram. So I went back to see them but I noticed that most of them was deleted. I was confused because I seen them on there like a month ago but now there gone and I know for a fact I didn’t delete them so who did.?? But over all Dubsmash is a fun app but they need to fix that because I’m angry and annoyed that, that even happened and I know for the next person that might  experience that there going to be mad too sooo..... STOP DELETING STUFF!!"
27,Lea Simone,"November 2, 2019",1,Why just why I’ve had this app for many year and not once have it ever deleted every single Dubsmash I made I don’t have non of my old ones that’s bad and that’s makes me not even wanna use the app if it’s just gonna get deleted I don’t care if it’s a new thing I lost what was mine and I want it back I can’t remake those and I like watching them and when I went to the app today they were gone and I know al you gonna say is ok we understand and we gonna fix it but this is a real issue you might have to down grade the app so I can get my stuff back or something this is your fault it was there 2 days ago and now it’s not shame on you  I just want it back
28,complaintpolice,"October 27, 2019",1,"What is this?? I’m not liking the new dubsmash. I say this because they took the option of the private post off of it and now when you make videos you have to post them publicly so everybody can. This is an issue for me because I make silly dubs and I don’t want people to see them AT ALL. I would like to post my dubs privately and also keep them in dubsmash so eventually I can save my old dubs for memories, but when my dubsmash updated all my dubs from 2016 til now were GONE!! The only videos that were on my dubsmash account were the ones I made a mistake and posted them publicly that way. I’m just asking can y’all please put the privacy option back on dubsmash"
29,Kayla_theslayer,"July 18, 2019",5,"Post from Camera roll Hi I have a request for dub smash ,to me I think that dubsmash should have something that let you post from your camera roll because sometimes people like edit their videos before they post it but on dubsmash you can only change the filter and write something on the post and stuff like that so can we please have something that let us post from our camera roll"
30,jazlynne_alondra,"June 8, 2019",3,"Issues on Views & Likes 👀❤️ I have a problem with the views and likes on my account they have been different from my activity such as if I get a like on a video I don’t see on my profile I could only see the numbers on my profile the next day and i still get the notifications from my activity but i still don’t see it on my profile so I would appreciate if you could fix it. Also, add a bio so people can express themselves more apart from just the captions and comments."
31,golden._.princesa,"July 22, 2019",3,"Look at this ! Dubsmash is a great app don’t get me wrong ! But when it has it’s downfalls they are horrible . When the videos constantly load & you can’t even load a sound . I have to delete the app then download it back just for it to work properly,,, & I’m tired of it !!!!! Also , sometimes when you are filming a video the blue will stop & not load the video . That also makes me have to download it back ,, which is a lot of work ! That is very aggravating ! ,,, but other than that the app is amazing . Y’all should add dm’s though ."
32,Jordin10411,"April 14, 2020",3,"Updates to Dubsmash I believe that Dubsmash is a good app I just think that Dubsmash should be a little bit more like Instagram or Snapchat, I believe that on Dubsmash we should be able to have a story, I believe we should have filters like the Snapchat filter and I believe that we should have a bio but for now dubsmash is a boring app I think it will be better with these changes I have stated thank you for reading my changes to Dubsmash that both you and I know should be made. We should also be able to make boomerangs and go live once we hit 1k"
33,ililna,"January 4, 2020",5,I love Dubsmash I love Dubsmash because it do not show your home in where u live like tiktok so no one can come in take u form ur home when ur mom is gone in Dubsmash is also special to me because u don’t know that ur friends have Dubsmash but when u follow them on Dubsmash in watch they video in realize in say that’s my friend in u say I’m finna call her in tell her that u follow her on Dubsmash in she be like what’s yo name in she say London_hot in she go follow u back in that’s why I like Dubsmash
34,skjsveyejsbkdsbwvejodnwvs,"February 12, 2020",5,Have one problem The app is great but on the explore page with the new update i think it would be better to actually explore and not just click on one video then you are on watching them on the explore page. Also When I get likes it doesn’t reload all the way it takes a couple days sometimes. Other than that this is a great app
35,Hallaween nessa,"December 8, 2019",2,"This app is glitchy This app is amazing! But one complaint I have is that I don’t know if it’s Dubsmash or my phone, but Dubsmash will not let me look at most videos because they’re loading. It’s not my WiFi, and it will never completely load it stays like that for a very long time, and never changes, Also, when I make videos, the purple line, that indicates it is recording, will stop in the middle of a dance, then goes away, making it impossible to upload a video!!! It is really frustrating and I hope there is something that can fix this error!"
36,jsksnsndn,"April 13, 2020",3,Love it I love this app it’s very creative but I wish there were a little more updates. 1st is to go live. I wish we could go live when we get it least 1000 followers . 2nd I wish you can upload a video that u saved but then press the same sound under instead of it saying original sound. 3rd I wish it lets u send up to 3 messages to the follower if u don’t get a follow back. I really love the app but wish these updates could happen. I really wish 1 was true. Thanks for your service
37,GamesAholic22,"September 7, 2019",1,"Why? I deleted Dubsmash a while ago and redownloaded it. When I went to creat an account and I put in my email. When I did it said I already had an account so I went to log in put in my email again and put in my password that I thought was correct. It said it was incorrect I said “Okay, it’s been a while I’ll just have it send an email.” So I did. It never sent I said resend but nothing happened. I think it should be able to send a text or something or if you already have an account it can say login or creat new account. I hoped you liked my suggestion and please take it into consideration."
38,cjbarri,"March 29, 2020",4,"Wont Save My Videos Ive used Dubsmash since 2017! Ive always been able to save my vids! Until the app update the save button will spin and it will say ""video saved"" but i wont show up in my camera roll! It is very important that i get my dubs out to my other platforms!! Other than that i love the app!! But if this continues i will be forced to switch app most likely Tiktok nd thats not something mostly because ive been on dubsmash the longest🙁!"
39,nelly._thebomb,"October 20, 2019",5,Love the app but I love this app but I do request some things I wish u could have sum like dm’s so u can talk to people and I wish you could change the color of the type on a video. Also if you could have more then one account on you dub so it would be a thing where u would see all the passwords you have. Love the app but I wish you could do sum updates but Dubsmash keep it up 💕
40,queen jayy 👑,"March 3, 2019",4,"Can you guys save all our likes videos Can you guys make like an area for liked dubs, Because when we like a video we want to rewatch it but we have to go to that persons profile to see it again. You guys should make a specific spot in Dubsmash where you have all the videos that you liked so that you can rewatch them. But I love Thai app and that’s the only reason i didn’t give it 5 stars."
41,braceface_nyny,"April 21, 2019",5,Finding friends This app is a good app but we need to follow friends . Like put the contacts back on there so we can follow people on this app . It don’t have to be the same old way but add the contacts so we can see our friends dance and we can follow them .also emojis let say if we make a twerk video can we cover our but up so nobody can’t see it???
42,Ambii Tunes,"May 29, 2019",5,Favorites I really love Dubsmash but can you please make it back to when you could do videos to any sound in your favorites when you don’t have an internet connection? I don’t have data and I get really bored sometimes. I go to Dubsmash when I’m bored but now that we can’t do anything without WiFi I just sit there bored. So please let us have that one advantage.
43,nessaaaa.wessaaaaa,"October 14, 2019",4,AMAZING BUT🤣 Dubsmash was the best app I’ve ever downloaded! Buhh at the same time it can sometimes get me heated 🤬 like I will get notifications late.. or it will freeze up on me even when I’m using wifi🥶 I think we should have a communication area and also lives.. for people over 1K fans. Everyone should get the ability to communicate with fans buhh not have to get there numbers or go on live sooo fans can see the real us! Juss a suggestion!
44,4ever jay,"June 29, 2019",5,Better than Tik Tok On Tik Tok when u try to choose a sound it searches something else but in Dubsmash when u search a sound it will search exactly what you want but the only thing I wish Dubsmashhad was that if u saved your videos and wanted to post them there should be a upload button where y can tap and choose your Dubsmash to upload
45,Kamrin10,"September 2, 2019",4,Good but... Dubsmash is a really good app . Since I’m not aloud to have Instagram I like it because it’s just like it sort of . I wish we could be able to Dm people and be able to upload other dubsmashes  from your camera roll to your profile instead of having to make the Dubsmash and then upload it . But other than that Dubsmash is great and I really like it . I don’t have much followers but it’s still awesome !
46,Ky_Ky-,"November 6, 2019",4,an issue I love the dubsmash app I have been using it for a long time now. Sometimes I don’t want to post a video that I recorded immediately so I save it to private and post it later. With this recent update if I save it to my privates (saved videos) then it does not give me the option to go back and post the video that was saved. This is a major problem that needs to be fixed. Please and Thankyou.
47,glowngvessel,"March 2, 2020",4,"Needs some updates Hello! So I have a couple ideas that could be put in the app! I feel like there should be a zoom feature. I would love a zoom feature! Also at least an option to were the videos could be a minute long! It is really hard to squeeze a lot into a video with only 20 seconds. I hope these thoughts could be incorporated into the app! Thanks, buh bye!"
48,mkkkskkskss,"January 6, 2020",4,"The likes! I would give this app a five but every time I refresh my page more than once just to make sure my likes went up it takes my likes down. For an example, I posted two videos yesterday. One HAD 2 likes and the other HAD 1 like but then when I refreshed it the 2nd time that video that got 1 like now has 0 and the one that had 2 likes now has 1 like."
49,JarellAncheta0116,"August 17, 2019",3,"I like Dubsmash, but... I first found out about Dubsmash a few years back when I was still very young. One issue about this app is that I’ve tried countless times to get an email to reset my password, but nothing seems to work. I could create a new account, but I might have some lost progress on my main account, which I really don’t want to lose. I used to mess around with the sounds on this app all the time, but now I can’t login anymore."
50,jjhhaannaayy,"December 29, 2018",4,- camera - my dubsmash is not allowing me to access and enable to use my camera . When it sends me to the settings it won’t let me do it and I am not able to see the camera option to enable it . Dubsmash is a awesome app that I love using so this is really confusing and aggravating me . I kept deleting and downloading it again but it’s still not working . Help please ?
51,Jmanishere,"February 10, 2019",1,Wow I don’t leave a ton of reviews.. but I recently downloaded this again after remembering how fun it was to do movie quotes and fun songs... my surprise that it has become something like back to the future 2. It’s basically a twitter feed of cardi b people twerking. Gotta say I’m scared for the future of the world. I don’t care to see what everyone is doing so don’t need it slammed down my eyes. I’m definitely not favoring any teen twerking to some rap song or type of music I don’t even get. Put a normal search system like you had before. It’s literally the worst. Deleting again..
52,ciarra2905,"March 26, 2019",3,Need more dub songs 🥴 Hello dubsmash! I have been using dubsmash for a couple of years and i am really pleased with the overall idea of the app and how it functions but there is one little problem and that is that on the treading and new music pages they always have the exact same song multiple times and when I want to find new dub songs I can’t because of the lack of variety on those pages.
53,Hay yall!,"March 30, 2019",2,"TikTok is better TikTok is way better than this. There isn’t as many songs and you can’t so slowmotions. Also, there isn’t that much song choices and nobody that I’m following on TikTok is on this app, so what am I supposed to do? What’s the main thingy called? Not the For You Page like TikTok. This app is only good if you don’t have any experience of lip sync or something. On the bright side, I am definitely the new transition queen because I feel like I’m the only one who knows how to do it. Ok bye now"
54,Drxp Succ,"May 25, 2019",3,"Too many Glitches It’s a great app to lip sync and dance too but the amount of glitches and updates makes everything worse. I can make a video and it’ll process forever. Not only that but whenever I try to get back into the app maybe after calling somebody it will take a long time to get back to what I’m doing. It’s slow and hard to work with but it’s fun. I’ll give it 5 stars if it fixes the glitches. Otherwise, it’s a great app no cap!"
55,@kensoken on dubsmash,"May 25, 2019",5,LOVE THE APP ‼️ Love everything about the app I just hit 10k today but the only problem I’m having is the explore page won’t load for Ive tried on WiFi and off WiFi and it still won’t load then has been occurring for about 2week and I want to be able to use the best sounds for my dubs can u PLZ fix this thanks 🖤
56,kaniiyaaa,"December 14, 2019",3,"issues again . I deleted the entire app , (&) my videos still stop recording & just plays the sound , I have to restart my device and delete the app several times & it still failed to work it’s like I’ll be recording & the app just stops the video doesn’t record & just plays the sound & this has just become a problem .. I really love the app but this needs to be fixed , I can’t record no videos at all ."
57,kk4403,"December 12, 2019",2,"Email troubles Ive written this same review before but there’s been no change: I’ve been a fan of this app for years now, and I decided to reinstall it and watch all my old dubs. But, I forgot my password so I clicked on the “forgot your password?” Button which was supposed to send a new password to my email. Nothing has come to my email at all, I tried many times. I hope you guys can fix this, coz I’ll just delete the app again if I can’t get my old account."
58,nightly92,"January 3, 2020",1,Love hate relationship I used to love this app but now i cannot get into my account on my new phone. I tried to request the reset link but it never arrives in my inbox or junk mail. I tried to message the team in twitter and through email but no one responds. It shows my account is still active when i try to create a new account too. So that is not the issue either. I also tried other emails to test if it was just my email not working but it tells you when other emails have an account or not. Im just stuck.
59,ms piggy lover💋💋💋,"October 12, 2019",4,Sorry The reason I gave it a 4 is because of the sounds and videos people make on dubs ash I love making videos but the things in the app aren't the best even for 12 year olds it isn't appropriate so all you have to do is fix that. Also something that made me a little upset was i couldn't make my account private or put on the people I want to see it.
60,Hay_itz_Jay,"February 22, 2019",4,"One suggestion... This app is amazing! I left tik tok for dubsmash and I’m glad I did! I have one suggestion though. I think there should be a separate section for private videos so that I can’t get lost to what videos are private, and what videos are public. Overall this app is amazing and I definitely recommend! Oh yeah, and please try to respond back :)"
61,_the.best,"November 22, 2019",5,Dubsmash is great I think that you should be able to do slow motion as well as fast. Also I think it would be a good idea if you could go live on dubsmash!! Another thing that would make the app better is if you could zoom in and marybe have like different face filters!!! Thanks !!
62,maya_gotmoves,"September 14, 2019",5,Let us post vids from our camera roll I love this app like I have 1.8k followers and I can just be myself when dancing.I was wondering if y’all can add this part when we can post things from our camera roll it will help the app a lot and will truly make it better.(in my opinion)
63,my butt25,"March 20, 2020",5,Get rid of fake accounts There is one user who i reported who is saying she is charli d’emelo and I’m pretty sure that’s a crime pls get back to ma and let me know what you think and i know for a fact that’s no her it’s a person who is saying they are her like for instants One of her posts says my best dance moment but they are charlis NOT the reposters dance stuff
64,𝓅ℯ𝓇𝓈ℴ𝓃,"December 24, 2019",5,"What I Noticed This app is the best and I really like it, it’s just that I feel like y’all are trying to be like TikTok. Dubsmash is a dancing app and in y’all most recent update y’all are letting people add videos from their camera roll and I don’t think that’s a good look on Dubsmash but I know it’s not my choice for the game so whatever"
65,baddie_blue💙,"November 30, 2019",4,"Awesome. 1 fix Hey, I like Dubsmash and I thinks it’s a amazing app! One thing you need to fix is when people with certain androids post a video people with iPhones go on there video and all of a sudden like there video stops in the middle of the video! I’m pretty sure it’s only if a iPhone user watches a andriod user video but I think that’s so annoying so can you plz fix that thanks 😆"
66,kiikii_lit,"March 5, 2020",4,"Update! I really like this app and it’s really fun but it annoying that almost every time I get on it, it lags and there is always something wrong with the audio. Or sometimes it would just take me off the app. I’m trying to do a dance but I can’t because the sound isn’t working. Can you guys please fix it and all the bugs."
67,buttonhirl23,"September 22, 2019",5,Suggestions Dubsmash if your reading this is saying you should add the different time things like slow and fast that would make it even better and also if you could stop it with little time periods but other then that this app is great!
68,best app reviewr,"January 12, 2020",5,Love but... I love Dubsmash I just think we should have a story like Instagram so u don’t have to post on ur main but u can post on ur story and Dubsmash should have a feature when u can add another account up idk 5 but yea make it like a real hit like if y’all can do that i would REALLY love the app as much as I do now
69,hädlëÿ,"April 22, 2020",4,"Good but needs improvement. Great app but improvements. First, it’s a fun app just I would like if there was weird face filters to make it funnier. Second, if there is something inappropriate, banned them from the app. This should be a kids app. Also, there should be a zoom when you are recording. Other  than that, it’s a great app!"
70,Tijianalove,"December 26, 2018",3,"Not as it use to be The videos load SLOW! Also, it won’t let me record as much videos as I want. It’s like I have a time limit to be on the app before it all crashes. For example, I try to make a Dubsmash and the purple bar stops and restarts and never lets me record the rest. Try to fix your bugs from this app and not the appearance all the time. Thanks."
71,Sxpreme.erica,"January 7, 2019",4,"Dubsmash Dubsmash is a really good dancing app and you can have followers and you can follow people as well and most of all you can make videos anytime and the cost is free and not one cost anything and the type of dancing videos, lips singing videos and you can make anything type of video and make all lot of types of things❤️💛"
72,AW20017489,"January 21, 2019",3,Forgot password just make a new account I forgot my password so I hit forgot password and I put in my email correctly everything and it never said in my email I emailed the dubsmash company they never reply back I recommend you download the app but if you forgot your password just make a new account because you’re not gonna see you there going to restart it
73,bad bhaddie,"February 5, 2019",5,👑👑👑 Thing I like about Dubsmash is that it has my favorite songs and things I don’t like it is that the videos come out blurry in that you can’t type up songs you want to type up you got to type up the songs they have .
74,niyeupnext,"May 19, 2019",4,Dubsmash delivery After all Dubsmash is a really developed app it’s been getting better over time . But what I think would make it better if you could see how many likes you have in total kind like on TikTok but y’all can be creative and design the heart differently. Other then that I think the app is fine and pretty delightful
75,ANARI MCGEE,"April 16, 2020",5,The trending page I love the dances I see on the trending page but it show me the same video and you can’t like refresh it where it take you to see other people si I’m ask can you put more people on the page and that about it thank you

I don’t know if it’s from the updates or if it’s because I switched to a new phone but I really need this fix. It’s not that the video aren’t there, it’s just when I try to watch them, it stops working."
80,JOCmymostfavorite,"January 19, 2019",2,"inappropriate content for kids We used to have this app and thought it was fun.  We were rewatching fun videos and downloaded again to make more.  The new format makes it hard to find family friendly clips to record.  Make a Dubsmash family app or kids app.  Deleting today, don’t want my family accidentally accessing misleading/mislabeled music that has curse words or crude language but is just titled ‘cinderella’."
81,Davy land,"February 28, 2019",3,Ok But...... I mean it’s OK but I haven’t use this app in over three years so I was bored and downloaded this but when I did it wasn’t as easy to use as when I first started to use it and the sound is not good once you shoot a video and when I lip-sync It doesn’t look good as when the video and it looks like I don’t know how to lip-sync at all when I do please bring back the original Dubsmash
82,Animal SS,"March 4, 2019",1,"Major disappointment When I first downloaded this app I enjoyed it. I was able to find my favorite movie quotes and make quick, hilarious videos to share. I haven’t used it in a while, and apparently you completely changed the format of this app. Movie and TV quotes are nowhere to be found. It’s just a bunch of awful rap clips. Not sure why you changed the format of this app to cater only to a very small demographic but, I’ll be deleting the app and my account immediately."
83,Kurishma,"March 6, 2019",5,I love Dubsmash but I think you could add.... I totally love Dubsmash but it would be awesome if you could text others and maybe even our name tags on the videos? And also maybe you guys can update us posting videos from our camera roll?? Thanks 🤗

86,its bri in the house,"April 26, 2020",4,Dubsmash I really like dubsmash because you can make short videos and text but i just wish that there was a way to go live if you have 500 and up and different things because sometimes it is very hard to get to 1k so I think it would be fair if you do 509 and up to go live
87,niyalashaa,"March 17, 2020",4,"great app just one problem! i love the app, i really hope one day i could become a popular dubsmash dancer cause a lot of people say i should be but i have one problem with the app. could you fix the problem where AirPods are out of sync with the videos you make with dubsmash? this problem really bothers me.."

But please do that and this app would be a 5 start and perfectly fine!"
89,DoggyQueen,"November 22, 2019",4,See Below For a while you guys have been needing to fix what’s causing Dubsmash to freeze when I try to scroll through my favourite sounds . What happens is I’ll be going through trying to get to the bottom of the list & it’ll freeze a ways down . Other than that this app is great

101,nickname1840264849,"March 27, 2019",1,"Sad story What a tragedy. This app used to be about mouthing along to famous movie quotes or song lyrics. That was FUN, and it had genuine artistic and comedic value. Now it’s young kids mouthing the words to trap songs and doing meaningless dances. When will we cease to cede our artistic territory to the increasingly mindless taste of America’s youth? I downloaded this app and deleted it within five minutes; what it used to be was good. What it is now is such a common story: a great idea that was ruined by the expectations of today’s brainless consumer."

173,slayin peyton,"January 15, 2020",4,"Some more effects I love Dubsmash a lot but, i feel like you should be able to switch it to slow mo or make it go really fast. I think you also should be able to “shake” like on Tik Tok but i don’t want you to turn into tik tok cause i like Dubsmash way more"

217,SunnyUlr,"September 25, 2019",1,"Disappointed I downloaded the app thinking I could find funny movie clips to recreate but only to find a bunch of music/dance videos. I tried to do a search of movies or even genres of content only to see again, a bunch of dance videos. I wish there was an option to go back to the old version where you could pull up movies and just recreate those, simple!"
218,whatever💕💦🦄🥇,"July 24, 2019",5,I love this app So I had a video and as soon as it got to 322 the video went private and I didn’t do anything to it so can you fix that but overall I love the app so much
219,miss butterfinger,"July 9, 2019",5,What I don’t like I don’t like how it updates by itself but personally I don’t like the size  of the picture frame it needs to be a little bigger
220,big banks brooklynn,"May 5, 2019",3,Cons I love this app so much but when u hit a new phone they didn’t let me sign in or log in it kept saying something so I tried on my cousins phone it said the same thing like bruh y’all need to update that but I think it’s only for iPhone 7s be it worked on my 6 and my mother’s 8
221,unicornbrownie24,"July 7, 2019",5,Very good app but This app is very good but.. Can you add a slow mo too mg because sometime there Is song you can lip sing to but oh Olson can have a slow mo nut there is no slow mo can you add one plus thxs if you can🥰🤪
222,No. 20 Entertainment,"June 22, 2019",1,bad for kids!!! I got this app when I was 6 or 5 and nothing bad happened with it. but now I decided to download it 8 years later bc all that me and my sister used it for when we were younger was to make funny videos but no having you to be 14 and having all songs be bad? Like is this just a inappropriate app bc that’s what it should be called not appropriate for kids at all!
223,nyijrai allen megad 12,"April 26, 2020",5,Suggestion I personally think you guys should add an update where we can search for a sound in our favorites !!
224,hehshdfj,"January 25, 2020",5,Suggestion This is just an suggestion but it would be cool if we could go live on dubsmash so we can talk to our fans and things like that but overall the app is cool.
225,Dmoneyy987,"January 16, 2020",4,Dubsmash one of my favorite social media apps Great app I think it just needs some special effects to make it waaay cooler. And I love the new update so you can message people and the Notification Center is in the top right hand corner.
226,joycerodiguez,"October 12, 2019",4,Update is not soo Good I really don’t like the update how do I get the old one back because if I want to unpost something and put it back into my private I can’t the only option is to delete it which I do not wanna do
227,yeboi27,"June 11, 2019",1,"Trash I used the app years ago and it was the best thing ever but now if you want to find anything other than music that’s actually funny it’s impossible, if the app made funny clips easily accessible then maybe the trending tab wouldn’t be so full of music (which is why I don’t use the app anymore) oh and half my saved sound clips are inaccessible for whatever reason"

231,😪😶😬😵🤢🤒🤠,"March 3, 2019",3,😐😐😐😐 I wish it was a little more like tik tok bc you can’t slow down your music or make it fast and they need to have filters... I would give this app a 3.5 star review until they can fix it up some. Plus you can’t make your account private.
232,DrBDDS,"January 17, 2020",3,Love the app- but when you save the videos the audio video don’t match Exporting dub videos don’t sync properly. For a lip sync app this is pretty stupid if all the videos you made have to stay only in the app to work. Fix this! I’ve tried updating and reinstalling.

239,taylor OLAF,"October 27, 2019",4,Great but It’s great I somewhat like the update but I don’t want my videos of me online where people can see me... I rather have it where you can post it but in private where no one can see my videos
240,Favoraintfair10,"April 20, 2019",4,Things that I like and things I don’t like I love the music and I love how you can never run out of videos also I love that we can follow people. I hate bullies on there I wish they had a report button on peoples videos.
241,YvonneMoreno,"April 29, 2019",3,Dubsmash’s database breached I got notified by my credit monitoring service that Dubsmash had an alleged database breach on December 2018. Passwords and usernames were exposed. I would check with CreditKarma or ask Dubsmash if your info was exposed too. Especially if you use the same password for multiple things!
242,skaylar wildon,"August 3, 2019",5,The Update I love the app and the new update. The only thing about the app is that the added these star things next to your name and I want to know how to get one.
243,kbear8080,"February 27, 2020",4,It is ok It's literary kind of good but I think they could start making like faces for people. I use it all the time I don't reccomend getting this app under the age of twelve... other than tht it is also like Tik Tok but different design.
244,ljbadself,"February 11, 2020",4,Why I gave you guys 4 starts I gave you guys 4 stars cause when I first got the app it was working perfectly fine but the next day I could barley make a video because it would stop my video 🤦🏾‍♀️
245,nanaocean,"December 15, 2019",4,Great! I love this app so so much! But my main problem is when these lil kids be twerking and when I report it’s still there it should be able to get deleted right then and there. Update that plzzz.
246,yalprettymagic,"November 18, 2019",5,Idk Why when I make videos and share them to Instagram how come the logo is super big instead of it being on the side

248,Sudokuness,"September 7, 2019",1,"Update Every time I have updated this app, I lost most of the dubs I had saved.  I'm so upset. A warning would have been nice so I could save them. The first time I was sooooo disappointed and lost so many things I really wanted. Now I know to back them up but it’s a pain. I wish I would have known this and you definitely should put a warning before people update."
249,king_queentomboyt,"June 22, 2019",5,Really good you should try it I know it’s may seem bad at first but it’s really good. I think it should have more songs but that’s all I can say bad about it.
250,Curlyhead._.Chrissy,"December 24, 2018",4,It’s okay I love that you can find songs that are on instagram but it’s glitchy sometimes and the finished product is not clear .Its a great app but just need better quality

254,Lou❤️💚💗,"December 8, 2019",4,🥰 I Love it I really do. But one thing needs to change. When someone likes your videos it doesn’t show. When I like my own it says 0 and when I unlike it says -1. This does bother me a lot

263,cutyee,"March 31, 2019",5,This is better than TikTok I know because on TikTok u don’t see how many videos on there that they made and u get to make your own song
264,Layla .A,"May 19, 2019",4,"App not downloading This app is not downloading. I have found multiple apps today and downloaded them, but this one doesn’t seem to work. Other than that, I like it."

267,BrownskinCaiyah,"August 17, 2019",4,Time length Its a good app for dances and challenges but I think it would be even better that sounds could be more than 10 seconds and less than 1 minute.

272,Chlobear2009,"April 16, 2019",5,Dubsmash is the greatest I don’t know how to put this but I believe that this app is better than TikTok just to let you know thanks for creating this app
273,uditkctxtox,"May 16, 2019",5,Kj Make it where you can have a profile picture and post stories

277,Biggest Khunhesf,"March 14, 2020",5,Dubsmash is da bomb I love Dubsmash because you can express yourself and people don’t make fun of you. The people support you and they encourage you. Also the dancing is better than tiktok.
278,Thebesthoe,"February 1, 2020",5,"Game changer This app is PERFECT for many reasons. You can make your own, lip sync your favorite memes/ viral videos/ tv show & movie characters etc. Really funny app to mess around with!"

280,dior_royalty,"January 2, 2019",5,I love Dubsmash It’s so good because like you can pick any song and it picks the right song you want and tic tok don’t it picks the ring song and that’s why I like dubsmash
281,s.johnston11,"February 3, 2019",1,Dubsmash It is bad because it freezes all the time the updates are horrible and you can’t do slowmows and make it go fast. I have made so many on there and now it isn’t saving my stuff all the work I put into a video goes down the drain. And sometimes it doesn’t let me see my own dubsmashs. So there that is why I gave it a 1 star rating
282,mipoopoo,"February 17, 2019",4,Great app but... I think when you shoot you should be able to have an optional speed. So there should be a slow motion and a time lapse. It would make transitions so much easier.👍😃
283,valerie2479,"February 19, 2019",4,"The app is good I like this app but when I like a song I want to put it a little slower but you can’t at all, but the good thing is that you can put them Privet when you want to."

There are kids on this app acting very inappropriately (lingerie dancing), no way to block the inappropriate (swearing, dirty dancing) from being seen.  I wish there was a clean version without inappropriate music and user content.  I feel like Dubsmash is a year or two from being sued over COPPA issues...yikes."

353,Baby Shishi,"March 23, 2019",3,"Three stars The reason I say three, is because you will like the dub, but you have no section to go see what you have liked. Basically you can’t see what dubs you liked ( if that makes any sense)."
354,TP RDCS,"August 29, 2019",3,"Not so good This app is nice but it could be better if you could maybe make slow and fast. modes and cool filter effects, reverse the video and make it a little easier to get followers and likes on your vids thx"
355,Khyamr,"July 23, 2019",5,About Dumbsmash It is the best and I am already getting used to it and I just started yesterday and I am happy that I downloaded it I love it so much❤️❣️💖💝

I did not think it would escalate to that craziness."
358,ybb_shaniya,"July 5, 2019",2,"Bad update Dubsmash used to be fine and I like the full screen but now the screen is a smaller box and it does show my whole body like I want it to 😡, I don’t know if I’m the only one who got this update but it’s honestly horrible, the old full screen Dubsmash was 5 stars"
359,ffgnvhjhdfkh,"June 16, 2019",5,Dubsmash bad thing I don’t like that you can’t go live if you have a lil people same with TikTok y’all need to stop that just make me so so so so so mad.

365,myahah,"January 5, 2020",5,"Help me! Also whenever I get on the app and try to press trending nothing happens. Lip sync , Popular Music , and Favorites only work."
366,tamyjah,"January 4, 2020",3,Dubsmash It appears to not be working as far as the trending dance and hot dance. Everytime I pressed on it it would just show up as a white screen and I would try to reload the screen but same results
367,Maddog3210,"December 8, 2019",1,"You don’t want this app.😡 Well this app is pretty good but is not better than tik tok. If you are 8 and under Yu probably don’t want this app bec it is pretty bad for your age. I got hacked when I had 970 followers, so I deleted dubsmash. P.S you can not do slow motion or reverse. Not to be mean but parents if u are reading this, let your kid have tik tok. It is better than dubsmash."

371,The ACE Family❤️♠️,"July 6, 2019",4,✌︎Good But More Suggestions✌︎ This is app is fun and a good way to express yourself. I suggest maybe allowing us to be able to make our own sounds. Similar to TikTok. But overall it’s a nice app.
372,Smackyblue,"July 3, 2019",2,Used to be better I love this app and it’s so fun!!!! It used to be so much easier to share videos and find sounds. I don’t like how all of the sounds now are weird songs or just trash. It kinda took a turn toward crappy mainstream social media but it can still be fun.
373,@baby.kay,"June 25, 2019",5,Dubsmash I love this app because you can pick from different song and dance to them

379,Hellodarknessmyoldfren,"December 5, 2019",5,FIX I love this app but it takes too long to process my video after I do it.
380,Kay646,"January 4, 2019",3,Uhhh.. When I go to the trending section it doesn’t work. It would have all the sounds that I favorited in the trending section. Idk if this is just me. I really don’t know what’s wrong with it.....😕 Other than that I think the app is great.❤️‼️

393,Sweetsallday111,"August 31, 2019",5,Horrible U need to tell who reports our videos so we can block them cuz they just jealous
394,margie.E.D,"July 9, 2019",1,Oof😬😬 This app use to be great! I was all over it before I got into musically and now this app has changed completely! The majority of the songs have wired perverted titles to them. Honestly it’s like an 18u app now😅 Its so weird and different from what it use to be so I would just stick with tic toc for now instead of going to this app.
395,ddjfjdjcjf,"March 25, 2020",4,Heyy I love this app but I’m new to it so my question is if you don’t know your current password and you try to reset it but it’s not working what am I put to do

401,Miss Left,"March 15, 2019",1,Filters gone Did you really get rid of the fun filters? Tell me now so I can delete if this is true but hoping you just changed something up that I can’t find because why would anyone take a feature away like that unless they want all their users to elsewhere.
402,sovidaa,"May 1, 2019",5,It won’t let me download I’ve had this app before but I deleted it .. I want it back & it’s not letting me download 💀..

431,Mary😎🤩 bearl,"January 20, 2019",1,Review Go smash is not that good because you could not pause the video like you can on TickTock and it kind of makes no sense so maybe you can upgrade it and try to put some filters in it try to put some cool stuff because I feel like it’s only dancing like a stripper some color stuff OK don’t smash
432,yusra 🥰,"February 24, 2019",3,Thoughts Dubsmash is an app where u get to dance and be creative. I was on tik tok at first bc that was the only dance app I knew but when I found Dubsmash it changed my ofenand I use it everyday I haven’t had any concerns yet 🥰.     Thanks for meeting my expectations ❤️
433,ronaldo jr ;)😜,"March 11, 2019",1,Bug😤 Their is a bug but idk if it has to do with apple problems or does it have to do with dubsmash but it doesn’t let me allow camera access and their is no option if this gets fixed it will be really helpful because I can’t really use the app😰😥

1660,Bradencn,"April 25, 2015",5,"Amazing fun I'm a guy who's who is boosted when I watch myself to goofy things...haha, but seriously. This app is seriously the BEST! I can finally find hilarious one liners or bits from songs and make stupid and funny short clips and share them with really whoever I want. My friends and family do goofy ones back and it is seriously he highlight of my day just to get a solid laugh here or there. They even make it so you can upload some of your own recordings and make a dubsmash of that. The iPhone doesn't let you have music on it and use the camcorder at the same time, and this all basically solves that while also making it easy to save all the dubsmash videos you've done."
1661,JRR1020,"June 30, 2016",5,"My all-time favorite unnecessary app! Plain and simply put, when it comes to sheer entertainment value and having a laugh among friends, Dubsmash is my favorite app. The novelty never really gets old whether you're lip-syncing to a song or lip-syncing a famous line from your favorite movie, this app stays fresh. I've tried other apps to try and find more options to waste away lazy afternoons, but they ultimately waste space and grow stale (Trivia Crack, I'm looking at you). Yes it's true, there are a lot of bugs and crashes with the latest version, but that's going to happen when you start taking an app that is initially designed for sharing among the Facebook community, and you start making it into an app that has its own friend list and its own mini social network built into it. Six months ago you pretty much had to have a Facebook account to use this app but today you could have a standalone Dubsmash account if you didn't want Facebook to be the final destination for your creation. To me, a big indicator of an app's ability to contend and to stand on its own two feet, is its ability to be fully functional on its own, without insisting users have a Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or Google+ account linked to the app for it to function properly. I have confidence Dubsmash will work out the bugs which is why I give this incredibly entertaining app a full 5⭐️!"

1670,Maelody1234,"May 8, 2015",4,"I'll come back to give a fifth star if... I LOVE this app so much! I have tons of fun and I can spend hours on it! However having so much fun ends up being pointless if there's no feed for the videos other than Facebook or other social network sites because not all of my personal friends want to see tons of videos of me being silly! I know there's a separate app for the feed that you actually have to pay for to download your own videos which is ridiculous because lately it has a load of bad reviews which makes me hesitant to even download it. having two separate apps for one thing is also ridiculous. Other than that I would really like to see the option to do split videos so we can act out scenes better instead of just in want to go. It's all mostly a great app and I love it, just fix these things and I'll love it even more!"
1671,Fallengrace4,"May 16, 2015",5,"Omg...hours of fun! Love it. I'm not one to write reviews, I think this is maybe the third or fourth review I've written thus far. Normally I give the stars, and that's it, lol. However I felt the need to give Dubsmash a big thumbs up. It's so much fun, you can add your own sounds or use one submitted by other users. I can see this becoming a very popular app, like it's not already, and hope to see new features added as it grows. I just hope it won't be one of those apps that after it blows up, they change everything good about it, lol. It's solid the way it is. Would be nice to have more options in the edit section, like maybe the possibility of user created content. Overall I highly recommend this app. It's very entertaining, easy to use, and the end results will get plenty of laughs from anyone you share it with. I also suggest this app to friends and family. "
1672,Kenman79,"November 26, 2015",5,"To Support 5 star because this app has brought out the creativity in me that has helped me make many new friends. Dubsmash is so much more than an app. It's a lifestyle! Super addicting, but in a good way and it's free. IG is the place to be with your dubs. "
1673,Zelig2u,"February 22, 2016",4,"So fun! So, there are a couple of negatives, but man is this app fun...and addictive!  The 2 negatives are: 1) The way it's organized isn't perfect. For example, there are tons of folders that have nothing in them. It would be nice if some kind of icon alerted you to that & you wouldn't waste your time looking in it.  Also, doing a search one way often will not return a result, but will another way. For example, you look for a song by a certain artist & you find it by the artist, but not the song title, or vice-versa.  It would be great if when posting something, the person posting could tag it with key words, not necessarily that show, but that are used for searching for it.  It would speed up the search process enormously!! 2) The app occasionally freezes...probably because I'm workin' it so hard!  All that being said, it's still an absolute blast and you WILL have fun!!"
1674,Oneminuteplease,"June 18, 2016",1,"Newset update is extremely slow The Dubsmash app was working fine on my phone until I downloaded themost recent update. Ever since then Dubsmash has slowed to an almost unusable crawl. The audio clip previews take a good while to load, whereas before the loaded pretty much instantly. Switching from one menu option to another is a crap shoot. Sometimes tapping works, other times it won't (but even if it does respond, there's always a delay, unlike before the update). Scrolling through my videos also has issues. Besides taking a bit to start playing, they tend to freeze up and won't let me scroll to another video until the current one finishes playing at least once through (with no way to pause). Ans because of the slowness and response delays, any Dubsmash I record since the update comes out choppy and out of sync no matter what. I generally enjoy Dubsmash, but this particular version of the app is a mess. How it made it's way to the app store in it's current state is a little baffling. I hope these issues get fixed relatively soon, because I would really would like to continue making Dubsmashes."
1675,racewalk101,"July 21, 2016",2,Older is better The original dubsmash was great and then you went and made it better and I thought 'oh this is perfect all the updates must be great!!!' Well I was so wrong... In the last update the whole thing got screwed up!! Now you have to save to moments or share it or else you can't finish making the dub. Sometimes I want some private dubs not ones for my friends to see. And another big thing they have to to fix is they have to make is on the update they made it so you can't share dubs on messages or anything. Now you have to save to camera roll and then share it. What if I don't want it on my camera roll!!! All I am saying it that completely ruined dubsmash and they have to make it back to how it used to be... Plus it deleted like 100 of my dubs and some of them were my fav dubs so you also have to fix that problem. I used to have over 350 dubs (I know that's a lot) but now I only have 220. You have ruined dubsmash forever and you have to fix it to get people to stop deleting it cause you are losing users by the day and if you don't do something soon I will be another user you lost.
1676,thãtkiddøø.saharaa,"October 10, 2018",1,"I really hate the new update Everything was fine the way dubsmash recently was because the cool thing about it was that we could send our dubs to our friends and save them to “My Dubs”. I also don’t like that the new update the dubsmash has to fit inside of a tiny square when dubsmash is the main thing that people use for Instagram dancing and stuff, but with the new update you can really see you whole body in the camera it cuts off your legs which is very disappointing. Can you please bring the old dubsmash back because she only cool things about the new update has to be that we can actually see the dub through a video which isn’t really that cool but it’s okay. Since I updated I can’t see the dubsmash videos that my cousin has been sending me and I can’t send anything to her because I have the new update. You need to fix this Dubsmash because no one asked for this app abuse, it makes a ton of people sad to see that something that we love has been completely corrupted."
1677,jacey725,"October 16, 2018",1,"MUST READ VERY IMPORTANT!! So let me explain.. I’ve had this game for years and I loved it there was so much to do. I could change the color of the camera, I could stop the video in the middle, I could send stuff to my contacts, I could save all my stuff, I could change the voice tone, all kinds of stuff. Now there is all types of inappropriate things on the meme part (the new big mouth cartoon) and I can’t do all the stuff i could before. this was one of the was to text and talk to all my cousins and friends and now I can’t do that. I would like to say I’m very disappointed in this new update 😐😐😞☹️(this is an edit) So I was on Dubsmash today and was very disappointed and angry with all of the new memes on there a lot of them are talking about inappropriate things!! I think that we should go back to the old update because what if someone has a really young child who plays on this app?? The inappropriate stuff would be very bad for them and they wouldn’t be able to play the app anymore!.... I personally think that you guys are loosing a lot of people who use to love this app!! Please go back to before it was way better!!!! Thank you for reading my review!"
1678,American Donuts,"October 23, 2018",1,"The new version is... okay. The new version is fine, it's just frustrating how you can't search for sounds that don't have videos for them or that you've already favorited. Something like that. It'll show stuff that doesn't have a video or isn't uploaded by y'all that I haven't favorited for OTHER stuff, but when I search up sounds I KNOW exist, it says there's no results. I want the old search back. NOW. "
1679,sauatch,"October 30, 2018",1,"Pls dub your better then this... Dubsmash let me tell ya that I love you. You have improved my relationships and made my life better. I also appreciate the fact that your still trying to improve and update your app, that shows great effort. But!!!! Your update is not my cup of tea. The best part of your app is sending these dubs to friends and family while you have great convo over dubs. Now, don’t let this discourage you! Remember Snapchat’s crappy update? They went through a rough patch just like you are. But it’s not too late for change!!!! Now please if you love your dubers then you will reverse this update (and if possible give our convos back cause that was some golden stuff). But mainly pls let me send dubs and have priv convos w my friends again!!!!!!!! Once again I love you and appreciate you! Sry this is a comment I had no clue how else to tell you this. And to the other dubers: share your agreement, we are better then musically and tick tock so let’s not change the wonderful thing that we are. The end. Can I get an amen??? Hallelujah!"
1680,Bunny booooo,"April 4, 2015",5,AWSOME APP This app is amazing it sometimes can be difficult but other than that it is fine well one thing i do not enjoy about it is that you can not make the videos clean that makes me kinda mad but other than that i really like it this is what the app is you type is something you want to voice and you voice it and you can put a prop in the video and you can keep it in your camera roll also you can post it to Instagram and Facebook I recommend this app to my friends and when they are over we make them all night its really really awesome the best part it is FREE it is amazing good job to however made this app... In my personal opinion i love it
1681,Aaliyah Martin,"June 19, 2015",5,PLEASE READ ❤️ I love this app. It's lots of fun to make funny videos and add popular sounds to them. I have some problems too ... I made a dubsmash account but even then my dubsmash's don't save. I restarted my phone and I had to download the app again. I was so devastated to find out all of my amazing dubs were gone. I logged into my account and the only thing that was still there was my favorites. You should be able to keep your dubs if you have to re download the app for any reason. 🙌🏽 I believe that's it for now. I still love the app. It would be amazing to be able to have a timer to start the video. 😊 Thank you ! I hope you listen to this and change a few things!! ✊🏽💜
1682,🐷🙊,"July 5, 2015",5,"AMAZING! PERFECT! this app is perfect for sleepovers or even when you are at someone's house or they're over at your house! you have to be 13 or older, which I think is good because there is some bad ones that have bad things in them, like cussing. i think if you're 13 or older you should be aloud to have it. if you're younger than 13 then you should NOT be allowed!! like some people get on it that's 10 years old and they change their birthdate to 1995 or 1998. and they was born in like 2004. In my opinion they should get in trouble! I think any kid that does that should get in trouble because some apps days like ""confirm if you're 18 or older"" and they click ""yes, I am 18 or older"" they should get in trouble because maybe the app is bad. "
1683,Backtees72,"August 21, 2015",4,"So much fun, kids need supervision I gave this app 4 stars because of all the laughs it has generated, but it does have 2 big flaws. There are a LOT of sound clips with BAD language!! I have to pre-screen each one for my kids. 👎I don't like this and neither do they!! Please add a way for people to rate their clip like a movie, add a kid friendly category, OR kid version app. The kids love this app too. Second, the swipe to delete a video within the app does NOT work. 👎 Careful what you save on your own time because kids can easily watch all saved videos in your app and on your camera roll. I had to delete the whole app and start over since the delete function didn't work. If these two fixes were made I'd rate this app a 5++!!"
1684,Me_🤗🤗💗💗😳😳😂😂,"January 21, 2016",5,It is amazing Download this app it is the best. If your a kid and your parents don't let you have musically this is just like it except it does not let other people see you unless you decide to post it some where else. And even if your not a kid you can have so much fun with it too. But some dubs that other people load up have bad words in them. But don't worry you can report them. And get them band I think. It is not the apps fault that there are bad words it the people that post it. And if they post a song that says like one bad word in it like in the song Focus by Ariana grande just let it go. Other than the bad words this app is Great. I use it every day so take it from a kid and download this app
1685,Łoving_łife,"March 28, 2016",2,It's Great But It Needs An Update ASAP! I love this app because it allows me and friends to do funny bits and dances together. The only few problems I have that I think take a toll on the rating is that 1.) When I go to view all the dubs that I have done there is a black line at the top of all of them and that if you keep playing them the line will go down. 2.) Also when I go to view my dubs sometimes it rewinds my whole video to the end and I have to go to another dub then go back and wait for it to get to the end in order for me to see the whole video. 3.) If I open the app it will sometimes take me out of the app and I have to clear it from my history and then go back into it in order for it to work properly. If these issues are fixed this could be a five star rating. But with those issues it's the reason why I give it a two star. Please fix this soon.
1686,Micah boo,"April 23, 2016",1,"OMG!!😡 I love Dubsmash. I seriously do. Im on there almost every day. I love to make dancing dubs, they're just very fun. However, Dubsmash has been having bugs that are very irritating lately. For example, whenever I like a sound, after a while it unlikes itself. Although this is a huge problem, it has never irritated me like the problem I have right now. ALL MY DUBS ARE GONE. I don't know where they went, what magical place they flew to, but I want my dubs back. I had very valuable, funny moments that I cherish very much there. NOW THEY ARE ALL GONE!!! Like I never made a dub before. It is very heartbreaking, because I had great moments in there. Dubsmash takes up a lot of storage, and I was considering deleting it because I have little to none left, but I didn't. Want to know why? Because I love Dubsmash too much to do that. Now that all my dubs are gone, I am this 👌🏾 close to deleting the app. Please, please, help me get my dubs back!!😔😡"
1687,The sup dude,"August 10, 2016",3,Fix the app now Can you plz fix the app whenever I try to open the app it takes me back to the homescreen plz fix before I go on vacation which is 4days from now plz fix I need the dubs. Since the update came out the interior looks so nice but I have only one concern which is on the old version of dubsmah you would like someone dub and it would appear is the sounds section and in my opinion I love putting the dub in my sounds section so when I need the dub I like I can search it easily through my sounds section but the update came out and that's not there anymore so plz put that in but you don't have too I don't want to put you through that hassle so take your time if your going to do that thank you for the new update I can finally use my dubs on vacation
1688,IDontUseDubsmash,"December 26, 2016",1,"Very Upset I woke up this morning to two emails from Dubsmash saying welcome to Dubsmash! I've never had a Dubsmash and didn't even know what it was until today. I downloaded the app and worked my way in using MY email address. Once I got in I didn't see the option to delete the account, only to delete the ""dub"". I did more looking around and found a video and a picture of the person using the account along with the persons name, MY email address and screenshots of the emails I received. I tried to contact support but it only took me to another link and didn't give me what I was looking for. I didn't see an option for account users to contact support letting them know that there is a problem. I don't want my email being used for something that I didn't sign up for nor did I confirm. I want this account deleted as soon as possible! If anybody can help I would appreciate it."
1689,Elani Williams,"October 14, 2018",5,"Please go back to the old dubsmash! I love Dubsmash and I’ve used it since forever, but recently you guys introduced a new update. The update is fine, I like how you changed the format around but there’s one big thing that everyone hates. You switched the video from a full screen video to a square video and it’s really inconvenient. A lot of people use Dubsmash for dancing and you can’t really do it anymore with the new update. You would have to be really far away from the camera to be able to fit your whole body in the camera view. If you’re too close, it"
1690,neversitsstill,"April 16, 2015",5,"A Day Changer! I discovered this app the same day I was told my vocal cords were paralyzed and may never speak again. The next day I had several doctor appointments and started using this app to express how I was feeling before, during and after each appointment. Using songs like ""get knocked down again"" and ""I will survive""... I can sincerely say the ease of use and the silliness of it all, instantly restored my JOY! It changed my day from a long day of doctor appointments to a day of  ""photo shoots"". It didn't change my diagnosis but it certainly changed my day and how I approached the journey ahead of me! LOVE THIS APP! It gives me a voice!"
1691,xandalekarlita,"May 3, 2015",3,"Upvote/Downvote feature would make it way better! So fun, with tons of potential - HOWEVER, all the sounds are terribly organized. Because the sounds are user-submitted there are bad quality, duplicated, and/or misspelled or badly-titled recordings that make the app difficult to enjoy. Sounds just aren't capitalized properly or even categorized and I have to go through hundreds of recordings before finding the exact one I want. I know you can report bad sounds, but even this takes too long. I think the app should develop upvotes or downvotes (like reddit or yikyak), that way good quality recordings go to the top and bad/irrelevant ones get lost in the bottom. I think that's the most efficient way of making this work and keeping it user-based."
1692,harleab,"July 13, 2015",4,"Awesome comes with downs I'm giving it four stars because the app is awesome and really fun with two people or by yourself but one down is on my new updated one after I choose the category and pick the dubsmash and record it. It asked me if I want to share, save, or message and I pick save to camera roll it says finish and when I press that it takes me off the category and I have to start back at the top and  scroll all the way back down. But the update before you had a choice after you saved it to go back to the same category and the same spot but now I don't have that choice! Please help!😀😛"
1693,Bubbleslikeyouboo,"October 5, 2015",3,"Great app I really love this app.  It's great! But I have to give three stars due to  one issue . I recently redownloaded the app  and I made tons of dubs. After I finished, I closed the app and went about my normal schedule. When I clicked on the app so I could watch my dubs that I created, it froze on the main screen and then the app crashed. I haven't been able to view or even get on the app. I've tried everything I can and nothing seems to work.  I really don't want to delete the app and redownload it because then I'll loose all the dubs I made.. I wish there was another way to get to the dubs you create... It would also be great if when you redownload the app(after deleting it )  the dubs you made with your account were still accessible."
1694,Bailey/Priss,"December 22, 2015",4,Great app wish there was more stuff I love this app it's great to use when your bored. But there is somethings it could work on. Like you should be able to search people's accounts and see what they have done on there's. You should also be aloud to see all the other things that people have done. By putting it on private or post you would either be able to see it or not. Also you should be able to follow people. Then you can like there videos. Because no one gets to see your videos only you. Then it gets a little boring if you watch them over and over again. No one wants to do that.
1695,why cant I use the all!!,"December 18, 2017",1,"Can’t log in I downloaded the app, in hopes of having some fun with the family, but I couldn’t log in. The app gave me the option of logging in through Facebook, so I did. But then it said my email was already set up with the app, and asked if i should log in that way. I attempted a few times, to no avail. I clicked the “Forgot password “ option to reset it, only to be told that dub smash had no record of my email address being set up with an existing account. "
1696,honeybadgerh,"October 6, 2018",5,Best app ever! Video memes creation!! I’m using the new version and am loving it! The video clips are on point and I love being able to create my own memes. The video clips makes dubbing wayyy more fun in my opinion because they inspire you create more than just the sound did. Also I’m not an overly creative person so I like being able to dub exactly what the video characters are doing. 
1697,Unique M. Jones,"October 11, 2018",1,"Take the new UPDATE OFF!! I don’t like the new update and I’m pretty sure a lot of teens don’t either, which means your ratings will kinda go down (because almost everyone that uses this app is teens). I feel like you should take the new update down and go back to how it was before. Because you have this new update a lot of people will going to be TikTok to make videos. And I can also say this for me and a lot of other people that the update was pointless, dubsmash was perfect the way it was. I’m not trying to bash you guys but I would just like it if you would take the update down and put it back to it use to be, I will not be using dubsmash until the update is off and it is back to how it use to. Hope you guys get my review and understand what I’m trying to say and reply or at least try. 😚"
1698,DayblueStar,"October 12, 2018",3,"Please just make up your mind... I've had this app since around the end of 2016 and I've had a lot of fun with it. But... why does the app change its functions and looks so much? I'm constantly confused whenever I come back to a new update. As soon as I get used to one version, an new version of the app is introduced! Some good things added some places, some good things subtracted. I do like the idea of having a community based around the app, it seems a lot less lonely that way, but the good things about the past versions keep disappearing and causing confusion. I would ask that Dubsmash would please, please, make up your mind about what you want this app to be. Thank you."
1699,peyton_thedancer,"October 18, 2018",2,"Ehh This app was great before the update, everything was perfect and easy to navigate and create, this new update cuts off your face and half the screen when u save it, which makes it very difficult to manage.. especially since this app is mostly used for dancing not just memes so it shouldn’t be so up close. Also I think they should bring filters back!! It made the app a lot more fun and have more personality, a lot video recording apps don’t have that option, I don’t mind the new way to navigate the app I think it’s good, but the recording changes is just making this app turn for the worst, and soon if not already many will start deleting the app. Once these changes are made I will use the app again until then.... what’s the point?"

This app is just beyond awesome and helps me scratch my quote itch in a way that also let's me act them out. I am absolutely in love with it! Only question I have and google doesn't seem to give any info, is HOW do you record longer sound clips? I see some clips that are like 10+ seconds and when I go to record, all I get is 6 seconds. Not sure how to change that."
1701,Smashedbro,"April 30, 2015",4,"Tons-o-fun I've used this app a few times now and so far have no complaints. I might be able to write a more comprehensive review if I had a longer time frame to use it in before being asked to rate it. Who knows, maybe it's slowly gathering my personality through my dubs to import into some AI being that will then hack my SSN, birth certificate, and other personal information and then kill me, masquerade me, and trick everyone I love into thinking nothing weird is going on. But would there really be a difference at that point? I mean who could tell? Anyway, if that was happening behind the scenes I'd probably change my rating to one star."

Anyways if you're a funny person then I recommend this app! And it's free, so if your just not liking it...that's sad...but it's free so you don't have to waste any money...I would pay 99¢ for this app if it cost money! You can do Dubs from Sweet Brown to your fave song! I definitely recommend this app! Just give it a try ya might like it! 😋😎😊😃"

One, can you please tell us how many dubs you and your friend made (seprately) Because when we want to see who has more I always have to count every single one . Also when you go to view your Dubsmashes can you go from newest to oldest or have a tab that you can choose from so I can watch newer Dubsmashes without having to go back to the beginning. I really hope you can make this happen !!!"

1708,yafavprincessmimi😝😍💋😘🤗,"October 6, 2018",1,Where Do I Start😒😤 This app is was perfect the way it was and I know there was some lil problems and I understand y’all or whoever was trying to fix it but that doesn’t mean change the whole app🤦🏽‍♀️ and hope y’all know that people like to dance of this app and now I can’t and other people. Also it was better when it was full body recording now it’s like a box🤦🏽‍♀️ and now I look stupid trying to dance because it can’t see my whole body...like why y’all had to change that...what was the point because I don’t understand. Just plz turn back your app you can a FEW things that you don’t want no more but try to keep it as how it was before...I  REPEAT TURN BACK YOUR APP plz😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
1709,Tianna❣️❤️,"November 17, 2018",5,"My review Can you guys please change the app the way it used to be! I gave it a 1 star rating because the camera quality is terrible, you get to see other people videos (which some people don’t want to see), you CANT see your full body anymore, and last the memes are so inappropriate for kids my age. I used to really love this app but now it’s just not fun and games anymore. Can you guys please change your app back to what is used to be, it would be so much better. Thanks for taking the time to read my review."
1710,Ambient Music Lover,"February 1, 2015",4,"Amazing! But suggestions... I can't believe no one has thought of this yet, it's so simple yet brilliant. This needs to be a new social media app. My suggestions to the makers are that you make it so u can delete sounds that u don't want anymore, fix the stinking tag system (I hate it so far) and make it so u can do custom tags, for some reason I can't do custom tags. Also make recording time for audio longer. 10 sec or however long it is is too short. And make it so u can take multiple shots. Instead of one and done video clips. Other than that look at other suggestions and ur good."
1711,rrrrrrrhonda,"April 19, 2015",5,"So Much Silly Fun and So Easy to Use! This app will not cure cancer.  But that's the point - it is purely entertaining.  The application allows you to create a video of yourself lip syncing to a few bars of all different songs and iconic utterances, from the app itself, from your iTunes account, or you can even record something yourself.  I find it works best when you really get into it, moving your mouth and gesturing as closely as possible to the recording.  I showed my recordings to a bunch of my friends and they all cracked up!  I love this app!!!"
1712,Thaimainhard,"May 2, 2015",4,"Dubsmash feed Honestly dubsmash is my favorite app of all time. I can spend hours and hours on it, and proudly show my friends later the videos and still laugh really hard at myself. The only flaw in dubsmash in my opinion is the fact that it doesn't have a feed just for it. I don't want to keep posting on my Facebook or Instagram my videos because I don't want to spam people's feed with videos of me being silly if that's not what they are there to see. I think that a feed of its own is really necessary and would help boost the app and keep it alive. Keep up the good work Dubsmash team! ✌🏼"
1713,Ariana loves you,"May 9, 2015",4,"Longer videos please! I really like this app and I spend countless hours on it playing around with sounds but what would be even better is if they could add longer time.. All they give you is about 15 seconds or so but that's not enough. we really should have the opportunity to go up to 3 minutes but AT LEAST 1 minute and then I'd give it 5 stars. Also we need to be able to record more scenes, we can start the video and hold the record button and then let go to pause and so on, and we should do with given one minute or so of recording. Sorta like vine."
1714,@ p3r50n,"May 21, 2015",5,"Great but please fix glitch! Ok, I have to say that I love this app! It's hilariously amazing. You can record videos of you dancing, lip syncing like Jimmy Fallon, etc. It also works as a soundboard, if you want that. But there is one glitch I've noticed. I have recently tried to record myself lip syncing to songs I recently uploaded, but it is telling me that an error has occurred. I personally don't think I should wait an extended amount of time trying to allow this to happen. In conclusion, though, this is definitely an app worthy of downloading."
1715,Pewds312,"August 7, 2015",4,"awesome app just one problem 👍🏻U know ths app is so amazing and I'm happy my friend told me bout it.⭐️ I would give it 5 stars but there's sumthn that bothers me bout it. 😫I don't find it fair that u need to have enough storage in ur phone , iPad, or iPod , etc to record a video sumtimes. 😠It really bothers me a lot because some apps don't usually require for u to have enough storage 😐. And I don't like to delete the apps that I love or photos too. It's like taking away gold or sumthn like that. Plz fix this (hopefully but I doubt it)...😔 Meanwhile I'm not going to b able to use it thx to ths 😒stupid request of ""enough storage"". 😾"
1716,sanuella,"March 23, 2016",1,"All my dubs deleted themselves I love this app and usually have no problem getting carried away with making dozens at a time but just a second ago, I was looking through all my dubs and when I got to the ones from last year none of them would play. I scrolled to the top and suddenly my entire profile was empty. As if I'd never made a dub in my life. Which is sad because I love making dubs and pride myself on them. I turned off my phone and turned it back on only to find that I'd been logged out of my dub account. So weird. Really frustrating. Of the 40 I had, I think some 12 really good ones were saved to my camera roll. Other than that, I'm pretty disappointed, especially since I JUST updated the app this morning. That was a mistake."
1717,FinleySpeedy23Z1,"May 1, 2016",3,"Updates Are The Worst I love Dubsmash. It's a fun, creative app that entertains and allows everyone to participate. In many apps, updates do things to improve the app. Not in this case. Although I love Dubsmash, updates are a pain. Every time the app gets a big update with new features, I can no longer open the app. It will just jump back to my home screen after loading. Then the app will get a bug update quickly after and fix the problem. Then the app will run smooth for a few more weeks until another update, and I am once again locked out. Please fix this problem. I love Dubsmash but I am getting annoyed!"
1718,BrizzyBlue,"November 19, 2017",3,"I love this app but ... since the creators took the “ my dubs “ away . I haven’t been using Dubsmash because of that . Although , it’s a quicker way to save your dubs to your camera roll , I rather my dubs stay on the app that way I can have more space on my phone . The only other way to look for my previous dubs are by going through my moments . Which takes a while to do . Probably like 5 minutes because I made a lot of videos in the past and that can get annoying after awhile . Every single time , tapping your phone into you get the video you want . fix this please .... BRING “ MY DUBS “ back !"
1719,Z.aireee💍💕,"October 7, 2018",5,I’m thinking about deleting the app This app is honestly is bad now ever since the update. And I did not even update it. I don’t like this app anymore. Since the creators update led this app . My videos have been cut off so now I can only see half of my chest and my face and I don’t like that. The original Dubsmash is better. Hopefully the creators can fix it. Because I don’t like it and I’m thinking about deleting this app. The favorites and trending category it’s confusing. This update is looking a little like Instagram and vine.
1720,Error 404: User Not Found,"May 24, 2015",5,"Amazingly Halarious Dubsmash is an app that lets you take sounds and let's you record a video of yourself or whoever. The app can only be as funny as you are, so inventive ideas and cool lip syncing can make this app your favorite one. Any downsides? Not one, given I've had it only a night. The app has a feature that lets you make your own sound and trim it to your liking. You can get the sound you use from a video. In the end, Dubsmash is a funny, inventive, and entertaining app. I'm giving it 5 stars."
1721,Luv_Bananas124,"September 15, 2015",4,Bad quality Ever since the new update my dubs have been blurry and pixelated in my camera roll. I don't know how but if you could fix that that would be great. I don't like the new set up either I think that you should go back to the old format. I hope you read this. I don't know if it is just me but I really need some help and I am seriously thinking about deleting the app but my problem is I don't know I it will delete my videos of that are saved to my camera  roll so please do something about it.
1722,Anonymous_56,"April 22, 2016",1,"This app is a joke This app is an absolute joke.  Any time I try to share videos via text I get a response from the recipient that says something like ""That video didn't send"" or ""It didn't go through."""
1723,Carp Family iTunes,"May 27, 2016",3,"meh.... Don't get me wrong, I love this app, I even tried musicly and liked this better. I have it on my iPad and iPhone and all my favorites on the iPad aren't there, but they are on my iPhone. I tried restarting the app, restarting my iPad, switching internet sources, but still, no favorites. I also liked the old interface better, you could see more and pause sounds. The old interface was also better because the new one is laggy. I understand it would be hard for you to save the videos, but I wish they would stay on your account. Please fix this. Thank you for your time."
1724,Oishley2000,"March 30, 2017",4,I love it but there a few issues Well if I play a sound too much it will pause and I have to power off my phone turn it back on and then search it again then play the sound. And sometimes when I get on the sound it will just have the blue thing and it will play but there is no sound and my volume was up. And also I would love it if you guys had like a sarcastic funny stupid etc.. thing where ya know you could find silt videos instead of having to search but I love the search thing
1725,str8fac3jay,"October 8, 2018",1,"Terrible The quality is freaking terrible ! Wat happened to the filters ? What happened to some of the dubs ? I like how it’s easier to save videos to camera roll but it’s taking a lot of space from my phone. As you can see there are TONS of Instagram dancers who use dubsmash but since this update most people have stopped using the app and dancing because of this update . As an ig dancer myself , I used dubsmash everyday to make dubs and post them . When we do collabs with other dancers we usually crop 2 videos into each other and we can’t even do that cause the videos are square! Us dancers are now about to go use another alternative app until you go back to the old version ."
1726,FamoussyyTyy,"October 13, 2018",1,Older is Better the old version is better than the new one ... I’m a dancer so I like to have the video longer in height wise at the end when I dance you can’t see my whole body because the video is a square and if it was a rectangle you could see my whole body. If you understand what I’m trying to say. Also you need to fix this search thing who wants to do a dub to someone saying things from a movie the purpose of this app it TO DANCE and now who ever updated it mess it up. PLEASEEE fix this stupid search thing because we liked it the way it was last time. Also I don’t wanna be dancing in no box cause you can’t see my whole body. JUST throw the whole update away and go back the the old dubsmash PERIODT❗️
1727,a random instagram dancer,"November 17, 2018",1,"Disappointed So I know Dubsmash has been our for a while but the thing I don’t get is how it’s been out for so long and it still manages to have so many bugs, like I understand when you update an app new bugs occur but it’s not like this is all new to you guys, if you guys have been updating your app for a while now there is no reason there should still be so many problems. For example, I’m not sure if this is just my phone but when we I do a Dubsmash and then I go to another one, the other dub continues to play in the background even if the current dub is playing. This is such a little bug so I expect it to be fixed. The update is also trash but that’s a whole other review."
1728,GAMER 2•0,"November 21, 2018",5,"Stop❗️ I’ve had Dubsmash for a really long time now and I honestly have to say I really dislike how this app is now trying to fit in with the other social apps such as tik tok. Dubsmash is a app for kids to dance on and enjoy themselves in, not make lip- syncing videos. I loved Dubsmash with all my heart and it used to be my favorite app but now it’s like your trying to be like everyone else instead of standing out and making the downloaders and people who stood by you happy. All I could say is I’m very disappointed"
1729,foodlover🥨,"November 28, 2018",5,Not as good I used to have musically but I deleted it for reasons I am not going to say and I downloaded Dubsmash and it is getting a little better but at first you could not follow people like dubs stop it or add filters now you can do all that stuff but they still need a few things like Alamo really fast normal like different speeds they also need a place where you can just scroll through and look at others dubs and if they just do those things this could be a really great app!
1730,Kk Saul,"April 1, 2015",4,"It was awesome! I loved it, I could make all these funny videos and send them to my friends but ever since it got updated I make a video and then click next and when I get to the page that's asked if I want to save this box comes up and asks if I want to be a fan on Facebook and I click Not Now but it won't go away, I've clicked over and over again and still just sits there! Like I don't have a Facebook so I can't become a fan but I just want that thing to go away so I can send my funny videos."
1731,Goldenshadow22,"April 6, 2015",5,Awesome! 2 things though. This app is awesome. I love sharing these with my friends. There some things I would like though. 
1732,Jahru808,"April 12, 2015",1,Not too happy Liked it as soon as I started playing but later on during the day when I would go back to play on the app again it would click out of it to my homescreen of my iphone and sending videos or pics on my camera roll was not sending. It would freeze after selecting the contact name I want to send to and then click out of me attempting to send the picture message. I only had this app downloaded for a day and already I feel like I want to do away with it so I don't have issues with me other apps or future sending of my pics. Please fix bug. I would definitely like to continue having this app but if it continues to give me issues I will discontinue
1733,JustAesthetic,"June 9, 2015",4,"Awesome! But just a thought... I've been using this app for quite some time, and it's been absolutely fantastic! The keywords are usually very consistent, the comparability is streamlined, and the sound synchronizes perfectly with the video. This may sound like nitpicking, but this app seems like almost a given for an entire community! I wouldn't mind hooking this up to Facebook and seeing a feed of all the dubs that my Facebook friends are making! Like I said, just a suggestion, but more of a luxury than a necessity. Thanks for all the laughs!"
1734,Some chick from Boston,"September 10, 2015",5,Too Much FUN! I'm obsessed! I haven't had this much fun with any app or game I've ever tried in my entire life! This app has changed my communication with everyone! There is a clip for every conversation!!! I love responding to normal conversations with famous lines and I LOVE when my friends send me them too!!! It is the best form of comedic relief through out the day! I am SO impressed with the variety of lines! It's too much fun I can't stop!!! And once I start.... I'll keep doing them until my phone dies! It's AWESOME!!!
1735,hannahlynne2017,"November 3, 2015",5,"Best Entertainment after 10pm My roommate and I love this app. We partner to dub and act our clips from our favorite movies. Sending these snippets to friends has caused a lot of laughter. The app itself works great, though it works best on an iPhone--clearer picture, no lagging. I think Dubsmash has gone through two or three updates over the course of several months, which always improve the look and ease of navigation. Seriously, this app is free. Get it and see if it's for you!"
1736,RaelynWinton,"March 27, 2017",1,What happened I use to love this app. It was so easy & fun but what happened to all the options??? Now you can pick from the handful of mainstream idiotic movie lines and if you want to search for a sound it only gives you usernames and you have to search through all of them to not find the one you are looking for?  Just to post it in budsmash. You can't save unless you post it on the dubsmash app where NO ONE is going to watch it then go to your profile  to save then delete. AND why is it stupid ridiculous with having to log in every time I open the app? I just want to make a simple video I want to send to a friend or save it... is it really that hard to make a simple app?
1737,Lexielou1000,"January 22, 2018",4,"Good but a few errors I love the app but there is a few errors but other than that I think it's a really good app I think you should add any part of a songs  movie or saying cause even though there is a lot of choices I only like two sections of the whole app!!! I do so many over and over again I can't stand it I wish there was more choices to choose from I'm pretty sure on my dubsmash account I've done ""I hate you i love you "" about 15 times in different spots and that's what I think of dubsmash!!!!!"
1738,Taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaylor,"October 7, 2018",5,"bring the original dubsmash back !!!! it should really go back to the way it was before. The moments thing was unnecessary. All we need was the original Dubsmash with “my dubs” and that was perfect. Now since the update happened it makes the video small, it flips or mirrors the video, and it has extra added features that no one will use. It should just really go back to the way things were before if that’s even possible."
1739,BRING BACK THE OLD DUBSMASHH,"October 7, 2018",1,READDD This new update is soooooo trashhh I hate it!!! Take it back to the previous one but keep “my dubs” instead of moments cause it takes forever to keep tapping and tapping a tapping to get to the dub you are looking for... Bring back the full screen cause you can’t barely see you body on the new update! And add filters again.. Just a natural dub is so boring to look at! This new update corny 
1740,jdrindon,"February 18, 2015",5,"BEST APP but one suggestion Incredibly entertaining app, but I think it would be really useful to have all My Dubs one a profile for other users to see. Since my friends also have downloaded it, it would so much easier for them to just go to my profile to see all of the dubs I've made, rather than having to send all of them in an iMessage. Similar to Vine, but if this feature was added it would blow Vine out of the water."
1741,Hemsathdancer04,"June 1, 2015",4,Awesome But Please Read Before You Get This App is Amazing and I LOVE IT! On some of the other reviews people are saying you have to save to camera just to save your dub well that's not true if you have an apple I phone I pod I pad whatever you can exit out and press the home button twice and swipe up so you can clear dubsmash and it works so when you go back to the app your dub is saved another thing is there is a LOT of cussing so if you you don't like your child hearing bad words then be careful with what dubs they play
1742,Kharris99,"September 22, 2015",4,"Awesome!!! But... The app is really fun! I've made a lot of these with my friends and gotten a lot of laughs. People have submitted great sounds and I'm always having fun looking for something new, doing it five times, deleting it, and trying again."
1743,Aviation angel,"April 30, 2016",4,"Could be 5 stars I love everything about this app. It's so much fun! My sister and I used to be really silly together growing up but now that we are grown, have families and live in separate states we have a blast sending each other videos. The only reason this doesn't get a 5 star is because of the disappearing songs that occasionally happen. It gets annoying because it will also shut down the app when it happens. It would awesome if the makers could fix that small issue. 😊"
1744,emma.brockshus,"June 21, 2016",4,Great except for one or two things Dubsmash is great. Kids are allowed to use it and there are great ones for kids. Dubsmash is kind of like snapchat. You can have a profile dub and be  friends with other people. About the profile dub… sometimes it will play in the background when you are listening to other people's dubs. It gets annoying but after a while you get used to it. Good thing you can push the volume button to make it stop. It is still great though.
1745,Cupcakes222,"November 20, 2016",3,My Favorite App but one thing I'm so happy that this app was available because I love to lip sync songs that I love.
1746,Gin jinn,"November 20, 2016",5,READ THIS! Dubsmash is an amazing app. But somethings to make it even better are to add fast motion slow-motion and maybe add some color like black and white. If you were to do these request I would highly recommend this app to all my friends and make sure they download it! Dubsmash is a great app but these request that I have just made will make it even better please read this and it would be amazing if you could do these request!
1747,Heart the ig dancer,"October 6, 2018",1,I HATE THIS 4.0 UPDATE why???read below For one I’m over here madddd like veryyy maddd because you can’t search up dubs that were there before but are not there now and you can’t make your own dubs and if you don’t change this back the way you had it everybody especially Instagram dancers will stop using this app frfr😭😭😭😭🤧🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬now I can’t even make dubs no more cause you have deleted dubs that were and they are not there now PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK PLEASEE and plus it’s only a square video and nobody wants it to be square OKAYYYY and Incase you haven’t wondered I’m an Instagram dancer and you sent me this update early and I regret even updating it NOWWW😓😥😥😥😥can you PLEASE tell me how to un-update it I am LITERALLY ABOUT TO CRY 🤧🤧🤧🤧
1748,babiee.ocean,"October 12, 2018",5,I hate this video square How do you think that people can just dance and the square any cuts off your legs I just don’t understand because on my want to see that you want to see your whole body where do you want to post it on TikTok or something or posted on Instagram it doesn’t matter you guys just messed up the Dubsmash app I kind a like the one it wasn’t updated thanks for that and I need you guys to change it back please please
1749,nakiyah😑,"October 14, 2018",5,Horrible I don’t like the video outcome they be in square and they need to be in full screen. It only show what is happening in the middle section. What if someone is dancing you won’t be able to see their whole body because they have it in a square mode that you can only see the middle sanction and it will cut some of their body off.
1750,Footballkid545,"February 16, 2015",4,"A few more things This app is the best app! It just needs a few more things, when you wanna record your own sound it is only 5 seconds long and some of the things I want to record are longer then 5 seconds, also some of my videos won't load like the ones I made, you should also be able to pause your recording or the video when you are making it, that would make it a lot better. Thanks for reading my review I hope it helped😄👍"
1751,Jdbrougham,"February 19, 2015",5,"Great app I know this app just came out, but there are some features that I would like to see added. 1) ability to view all of your favorites 2) ability to have 'tags' in clips so that you can search for certain things other than just name 3) ability to add sound to a previously recorded video. These are just some things that I think would make the app even better, but so far it's good fun :)"
1752,Gl1tt3rK1tt3n,"May 28, 2015",4,"The MOST FUN EVER. This is probably most fun and enjoyable app I have ever had. I can waste hours just recording over and over again. The only thing I would change is making the names standardized of the uploads, like you have to enter the title of the movie or artist. That way you can search for exactly what you want to hear. And I agree with the other reviewers that there should be a way to save your dub recordings in the app rather than save to your camera roll. Otherwise I friggin love this app."
1753,bigrob1625,"December 8, 2015",5,I love Dubsmash!! I use this app every single day!! I would like to add a suggestion though. Imagine if one person could do half and another person do the other half. My friends and or family are not always available and it would be cool to be able to see other people in videos as we go back and forth making a funny video or clip. I think this would be interesting. You could call it DubVid. :)
1754,Why it's fun,"April 8, 2016",5,On my free time Dubsmash is fun because it easy to do it doesn't have many steps. I like to go on Dubsmash because it makes time fly for me. I also enjoy that if you like a sound or a part of a song it is accessible off Internet. I also like it because wile you lipsink on the video you can also do a video and like make moves for it which is really fun. 
1755,queyah,"May 2, 2016",1,"I like the new update "" But...... I have a iphone 4s and i had the old update of dubsmash and it was working really well and good and now that i have updated it "" it will show tge bottom part of dubsmash then blinks out idk wTs wrong but can u fix that cause it was working so good till now 💯 I mean if u dont fix it i dont wanna be apart of this app and i will write bad reviews everyday about this app so please fix it im so tired of these different kinds of app treating iphone4s so different now u gotta have ios8.0 update this is so stupid u shouldnt have to have any update please fix this because im not the only one thats going through this my friends are to and other people say the same"
1756,Stopwiththestupidimprovements,"June 2, 2016",4,"Upset. I loved this app but I had to delete it for storage. I re downloaded it, signed into my account, and all of my precious dubs were gone! I don't understand why they would be deleted if it was the same account. I'm extremely upset because there were many dubs that I've lost that I can never do the same way. However, it was a great app( at least before the update). But since all of my dubs are gone, I will be deleting it again as it has no use."

I haven’t been in this app since they took away my dubs it’s a fun app but they gotta bring back my dubs and then I’ll come back on it. Please bring it back.. thanks
1759,SP.1984,"June 25, 2018",1,"Requires all Facebook info to share upon signing up Downloaded the app for the first time and tried to sign up through Facebook. Upon clicking on review the info you provide where u check or uncheck the info you share with the app, I basically checked on sharing my profile info, my email id and my date of birth with the app. But it showed an error saying ‘You didn’t give Dubsmash permission to access your data on Facebook’. The last info i didn’t check was my list of friends. I assumed the app shouldn’t make it mandatory to share the whole of your Facebook info with the app but somehow they have made it necessary. Weird."

Search for specific voices, characters, movies, etc.  I come from a family of goof balls, so we send videos back and forth endlessly.  Have had no problems with download or otherwise.  Tons of fun with this.  We use props, and costumes, and lighting to make it even funnier at times.  Tons of voice options, well categorized.  A must have for fun-lovers."

It gives me a chance to become an actress and show off my talents! lol Makes the funny memes, popular clips and favorite songs even more interactive. Only a couple of bugs I was able to notice so far...when I'm in a phone call the playback video doesn't pause or stop so I can hear it when I answer a new phone call. Also having issues with the recording playback every once in awhile. "
1762,983ave,"April 29, 2015",4,"Yes but one thing.... I love this app but there is one thing I wish it had...I would love if when you made a dub you could make multiple scenes in one dub itself. It would be nice if it was like vine. For example you should touch the ""start"" button and you should be able to touch it again and have your dub pause. So that would be one clip so far. Then you should be able to keep pressing start and stop until the recording you are making the dub to is over."
1763,Mina 💖☺️,"July 25, 2015",5,Best app ever 💯👌 This app had me laughing so much just watching my own face expressions it has the best sounds ever and best timing and it is lots of fun and you can always save the videos and when you're having a bad day just look at those videos and you'll be laughing a lot ! And forget all of your problems and within 2.5 seconds . Trust me on this one you'll like it a lot ! What are you waiting for ! Download it now !!!!
1764,RollerSkate33,"July 27, 2015",1,Terrible!!!!!! When I first got this app I loved it then like a couple of days after I when back on it and tried to record something and it said I didn't have enough storage we I went and deleted 217 pictures and videos then I went back one the app and tried to record and I got about half way into it and stopped and said that I didn't have enough storage and I went into my settings and found out that just recording that it took 4 GB off of my storage so now I don't have any available storage and I can't even get it back! So unless this is a problem that is just my phone then okay but if not you don't want to end up like me...
1765,Lulu6703,"September 10, 2015",5,Great fun for laughs! This is a great app just to have fun. My grown children and my granddaughter and I
1766,Kayla70707,"June 15, 2016",1,"ALL DUBMASHES GONE Don't get me wrong, I loved using dub-smash. It was fun and entertaining with my friends and I. But I accidentally deleted the app off my phone, but  quickly re-downloaded it back on, SIGNED ONTO MY ACCOUNT,(which I remembered thankfully) and noticed that ALL of my ""saved"" Dub smashes were gone! Kind of disappointed how they didn't save... Except my profile dub smash video which isn't even in my saved dubmash album.. Doesn't even make sense. Goodness, I had some really top notch ones too..: ( "
1767,RicanxMyaa <(Follow me),"October 6, 2018",4,Good but bad I like the new update...I’m a dancer and I been using dubsmash since I was 10 cause I dance on instagram...semi famous.// but the only thing I really hate is the square video thing...the rectangle one was better...I just hate it and you can barley see most of me dancing// likeee// but other than that it’s good..hopefully you change it cause that a whole problem...or you should give a option to pick what video shape you want...and it downloads to camera fast so that’s like really good
1768,yourfootssavior,"October 7, 2018",1,"New Update is Trash The new update is trash because now the screen is like a box instead of the full thing like the old update which i really dislike, and you might think that the short videos like Instagram is cool but it actually isn't because from multiple perspectives no one cares about the videos. People only care about the making and song of the dubs. This is not Instagram which will also cause your users activity to decline greatly. Ugh the screen is so small o had to step 10 feet away in order for my whole body to be in it. It needs to got back i hate it. No one gives a **** about memes CHANGE IT BACK I HATE ITTTT"
1769,Zoeeee🤪💖,"October 10, 2018",4,The new update🙄😤 Honestly I do not like the new update. I can’t see my friends dubs anymore. I don’t like how all the dubs are in one place. The old Dubsmash we just had to click a button and it saved then we can go to my dubs and see them. I don’t like the way it is set up. I think it’s trash honestly. I’m not trying to be rude or anything. My friends and I do not use Dubsmash as much anymore because of this update. Can we go back to the old one please. It was easier that way
1770,Bellanator03⚽️,"May 25, 2015",5,Amazingly hilarious It is so much fun my family and I love it. We just sit on the couch chill and do dubsmash.  It actually bonds our family together we have a lot of fun even though we have to do some of them over and over again but it is a great time consumer and a great family app but you have to put more child friendly things. For me I do it in lots of places with my friends and on my own I will always love dubsmash.
1771,Alamocitymama,"June 1, 2015",3,"Please Indicate which ones contain profanity We have so much fun with this, but it's like a profanity minefield. You never know which one is going to drop an F bomb or something of that nature. I have young children and I would like to protect them from this, but there's just no way of knowing until you listen sometimes. For instance, tonight my daughter and I were searching ""miss you"" to send one to my husband who has been away for several days. I was bummed when two or three out of the 10 I listened to contained profanity (but it was not noted in the title/label)."
1772,Jane B.M,"December 29, 2015",2,"Yes but no Dub smash was a very fun game in the beginning. But over time it began to be very difficult and become very stupid. One time I forgot to update the app so it updated it for me. On the thing it said that it would fix bugs, but instead of fixing bugs it created them. I had to literally go into my settings find the privacy section turn off the photos and then turn on the Photos in the dub smash app in the setting. One of the stupidest and stressful nights of my entire life. I am really tired and I'm glad I deleted the app. Should you keep this app, sure knock yourself. Like I said it was fun."
1773,Covet dreamer,"April 16, 2016",3,"What's wrong with my dubsmash!!? I think this app is a truly fun game to pass time and I think that it's amazing all the sounds there are. But lately my dubsmash has had these black lines on top that are taking out half my dub.😑 I deleted the app and redownlaoded the app to see if it will fix it. It wasn't fixed and now Four months worth of dubs are no longer there. I also try to add pictures, filters, and words, but they won't save. Please fix these problems asap cause I enjoy dubsmash, but this isn't working well right now."

Then wait for it to Load .... Ok now here's the part that's gets me it loads Slo now I press the next button the it jus takes me off the app I tried everything like re downloading it , logging out , turning my phone off n on nothing change still the same PLZZZ HELP NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ANNOYING PROBLEM 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
1775,Hoosiergal77,"July 4, 2016",3,"Liked it better before latest update The changes made in the newest update seem to make it less user friendly. I don't like the search features for sound clips. Also if your not careful, you get stuck with a profile dub. You can change it, but will now always have a dub on your profile whether you like it or not. I don't like not having control over my own profile features."
1776,Shieldzyboi,"January 13, 2017",5,A possible update for developers Ok so I tried to combine the boomerang app with dubsmash but it wouldn't let me so I think that you should update it so that when you tap on a dubsmash and try to create it you should be able to put a video on repeat from your camera roll then you would be able to put music in the background of a video that you like pls look at this developers thankyou
1777,Ci3raaaaa,"March 5, 2017",1,F dubsmash and whoever made it !! All my dubsmash's deleted and I'm still mad and this happen like a year ago or the year before and I'm still mad !!!

1778,Jazz❤️❤️,"October 9, 2018",5,I Like Dubsmash But The New Update Is Dumb So I’ve Had Dubsmash For A Whole Now And I Loved Making Videos On There❤️ . But Now That It Updated When You Make A Dance Video You Can Barely See The Person’s Face🙄🙄 . Many People Say The Same Thing About Dubsmash And How The New Update Is Dumb👎🏾 . I Think The Same And That Dubsmash Should Make It Back To The Way It Was Before But Just Different Types Of Updates😁👍🏾 . So If Dubsmash Could Make It Back To The Way It Was More People Would Be On It😘 .
1779,kiy_lyn.love,"October 10, 2018",1,"Dubsmash got worse since the new update First of all I would like to say that I used to love Dubsmash but now after the update Dubsmash is T E R R I B L E!!!! First off when I save dubs to my camera roll and on my dubs, the camera goes into a halfway mode and u can’t see everything. Plus there is no color filters anymore so the dubs I make are halfway and boring. I wisj I could get the old Dubsmash back but for now I’m just going to uninstall it because now when I make dubs they look like Trash and are spilt to a weird half screen. I don’t know if it’s because the Japanese have took control of the design of the  app but it’s just not the same anymore. So Long forever Dubsmash!!!!"
1780,Scravs,"April 29, 2015",5,"Get drunk, and Smash some Dubs!! My co-worker introduced me to this app. That same night my girlfriend came over to hang, have fireball and brew. We had a BLAST with this app!! Only real downfall that I could find was that the dubs can only be 15secs or so. It limits the material that I would use to create my own. Also there needs to be a ""reverse"" dub smash....take clips from TV and movie, and add your own sounds and dubs (when you make this app at least foot note me...lol)."
1781,Chaga1,"May 27, 2015",4,"AMAZING but... I just love this app but… I don't really like that I have to save to camera roll or else it won't save to ""my dubs"". I would definitely give a 5 stars rating if that could be fixed. Also it keeps saying that "" an error occurred "" and I did check but it's completely fine and it keeps saying that but over all it's an AMAZING app for family even though it may say some bad words and stuff  but it's an amazing app over all. 💙💞💖💘☝️👊✌️😜👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏☝️☝️☝️✊✊✊😄😃😀😊☺️😉😍😜😝😛😳😁"
1782,Jen Jac,"September 11, 2015",5,"Addictive!! This is so much fun. It's totally addictive. I've gotten several friends hooked on it & we have ""Dubsmash Wars."" If one of my friends sends something from Anchorman, I'm like ""Ooh, wait! I can do one from Anchorman as well!"" We try to outdo each other. It's hilarious. There are also great ones for kids, so it saved a lot of my friends with smaller kids towards the end of the summer when they started to get bored. Great for everyone!"
1783,SR337,"March 1, 2016",4,"Love it, but... I absolutely LOVE Dubsmash. My friends and my fiancé all have so much fun sending videos to one another, but this morning I noticed that my page in the app where I can view all my videos I've made is just all images of the videos without the titles, so I can't find anything specific without going into each video.  Please change it back the the list with the titles without auto playing them, other than that it's fantastic!"
1784,Sa'Mya 🔆💕,"June 23, 2016",1,stupid😒 I got a new phone so after I set everything up I  downloaded the app on it and when I logged in and tried to look at all my videos they weren't there!!! I find this so stupid because I thought my videos would save and be there when I logged back in but I was wrong😒😒😒 I lost all of my videos and I made a lot of them precisely about 100 of them and to find out they're all gone is devastating 🙄 so a little advice instead of changing all of this stuff how about u fix the most important thing about the app😒😒😒 what's the point of having a sign in button when all of ur videos are gonna be gone.✌🏽️
1785,Kaylahbutts04,"August 24, 2017",3,Terrible new update ☹️ I don't like the new update . You can't delete your moments && you don't have the option to save it to your camera roll and every time you wanna go back to look at your moments it always starts to the begging . Like who wants to look at allll those dubsmashes you made . Most of the time I just want to look at the ones I recently made but it's always going back to the very first one && to me it's too much having to add it to your personal dubs and not being able to save ur moments 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️.
1786,Tylayahhh♥️...!,"October 6, 2018",1,"IM IRRITATED ! This update is confusing !! The app was going just fine before I downloaded this update... It’s very confusing & annoying because I can’t find my friend’s dubsmash & it’s hard for me to save my dubsmash to my camera roll !! I would appreciate it if y’all change the app back to the way it was because before I could send chats to my friends, I could save my dubsmash & I could find things easily but now everything is all switched up !! I am very disappointed & unsatisfied therefore I’m un downloading this app & telling my friends to do the same too until this update is deleted ! Hate comment from very annoyed customer🙃!"
1787,mixedhailey,"October 17, 2018",1,TAKE THE NEW UPDATE OFF I love dumbsmash a lot because it was easy and funny to use until you guys updated it now it’s so complicated and terrible when it updated everything was in Arabic and I didn’t understand I had to delete the app and reinstall it for it to get its self together its like u guys are tryna be like tik Tok and be like Instagram and Facebook like no stick to the way it was the hell is y’all doing ? Can you switch it back because it also shrinks my video when I take a video it’s annoying because I have to set my phone far away just to get my body and it still doesn’t get my body like how am I supposed to use the app
1788,scooby dooo 63739253,"November 10, 2018",3,It’s okay but not as good as the old dubsmash First of all I know y’all brought back the full screen but the quality is garbage 👎 But I like how it has all the famous hashtags in one place and how you can put your dubs out in public 👍 Also on the old dubsmash you could pic your frame that was helpful for me because I use PicPlayPost but I can’t even use it anymore because the video is to big and close together 🙄 Just can y’all PLEASE bring back the old quality and the choose of which frame you want 🙏
1789,CurlyHead_Queen😻,"December 1, 2018",5,"I LOVE THIS APP❤️❤️ Suggestion? This app is amazing to share your personalities and moods without saying. I’ve been a dubsmash member since the app came out. But look, with all the updates it seems to me that there isn’t a search bar in the favorites!! If I’m looking for a particular dub, then I should just search for it not scroll through all my recent favorites. So may you add a search bar to the favorites?🤪☺️"
1790,rbama93,"May 2, 2015",4,"Fun but needs more This app is so much fun. The only thing it needs in my opinion is a feed so you can view other videos and follow your friends. It's fun sending videos back and forth to my friends but being able to share it among your followers would be fantastic. And when you upload audio, more than ten seconds should be allowed. I rated 4 stars because I love the app I just think it needs a couple additions before it's a five star app."
1791,('~_~'),"June 16, 2015",4,"Has potential for video editing greatness!!! I love the app and the idea, but the app would be even better if users could have the ability to upload pre-recorded videos to use for theirs tracks. We can upload our own tracks, so why not our own videos? This is the only thing keeping me from giving this app a 5-star rating. Fix this, and this will be my go-to app for editing and it'll make what I do a heck of alot easier."
1792,Abelhawk,"September 30, 2015",5,"Funnest app ever! My family always quotes movies, so we've had a blast using this app and sharing the videos we make with each other! A lot of fun and super easy and simple to use. "

1794,La'shelle96,"July 12, 2017",2,"Hate the update I had some really funny dubsmashes and they were my favorites but when I updated it deleted ALL of them and deleted a lot of the sounds that I liked so I can't even remake them. Since the update the video lags with the sounds AND there were a lot more categories to choose from to listen to the sounds, now they have really crappy categories to look into. They need to make the categories the way they used to, to make looking for funny dub sound easier. I loved it before the update now I wish I never updated it."
1795,@Kaylakandance,"July 18, 2018",3,"Video finding problem😤😢 I’ve been using the app for quite a long time and I LOVE IT. There are a few things that bug me about the app but one thing stands out the most, MY VIDEOS! Every time I look for a video it takes me a really long time to find it. I personally think there should be an easier way to find your videos. I have so many videos on my “story” and it takes so long to find certain ones. I think that the app could really use an easier way to find your videos."
1796,Cheer_Is_Life_DUH,"August 18, 2018",4,"Good App but needs more I love this app it just needs to add more fun, like adding slow motion or fast pace so it’s just not one pace. That would make the app 10x better. Also, add some popular songs or stuff, but the whole thing so we can pick what part of the song we can play. One last thing that would make it better is making the songs a little more longer. Can you please do at least one of these. Thanks. Have an awesome day."
1797,keke11under456,"October 10, 2018",2,The reason why people are deleting the app You guys need to fix the quality on the app and we need the rectangle again because the square only shows half of our bodies and we need to show our whole bodies and that’s just not working for us that’s not just coming from my point of you is coming from a lot of people‘s point of you on Instagram because we were Instagram being serious what did your mom is done so please I would really appreciate it if you guys fix or update the quality and update the the square to a triangle
1798,Shaaaeee,"October 14, 2018",5,"I hate the new update I really don’t like it, bring the old Dubsmash back. We have to do our dubs in a square and it’s disappointing then we can’t save to “my dubs” or send to friends everything I sent to my friends are gone then when I couldn’t save I sent stuff to my sister I have old dubs with my uncle that passed away and I can’t even see them anymore this is frustrating"

However...there are a lot of times where it looks perfect in the App but it lags a second behind when posted. Not really sure how you'd fix that. :) I also wish there was a way to know if the sound had bad language...because after all...kids have fun with this too.

We liked it when we could crop our own videos the way we liked it. And we can’t even do filters that just really made me angry and no moments at all chatting nothing dubsmash WAS my favorite app but no longer is because of this update I hope the company see this and change it back plz and thank u.

1820,Weirdnames,"May 21, 2015",2,"Honestly disappointed I was really excited to get this app because a lot of my friends have it, and it looked awesome! However, it is one of the most frustrating apps I have ever used. When I try to add my own iTunes music, the sound doesn't even work, and says it's still preparing my music. Then when the iTunes song finally works, I try to make the video but it says error, and doesn't let me. Also, I made a few videos with sounds I had to record myself (instead of iTunes), and it just erased all of my dubs...sad times."
1821,LVACSPPLR,"May 22, 2015",5,"hilarious!😂 this is such an amazing app! u can pick a sound/quote from ANY of your favorite movie or book or song or show! there are some inappropriate ones, but some of them are fine for kids! i mean I wouldn't let young children roam the app cuz there is sex and swearing. but ur kids can do a lot too! my 8 year old loves it too (the kid ones) it's a must get app. I cry of laughter!!!😀😀😀😂😂😂😎😎😎👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🎉🎉🎉☀️☀️☀️🌸🌸🌸🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻✌🏻️✌🏻✌🏻"
1822,Cheeky beets,"June 24, 2015",2,"Fun, then issues, now frustrating (iPhone 5) I've never written a review but so frustrated with current issues. After an update the app has never worked the same. When I record a sound and want to delete and start again, the original recording does not delete, it plays on a continuous loop in the background. Only way to remedy is to uninstall and reinstall the app. If I record a sound and want to save, the app freezes. I have had to uninstall and reinstall so many times to get out of a dub smash mess. Please fix!"
1823,ariana⠀,"July 18, 2015",3,"Again?!? I've been having problems with this app lately, because you fixed it not adding to the soundboard l, but now I can't even add them to my soundboards! It won't even show the thing to pick which soundboard... It's not frozen, and my phone works just fine... You really have to fix this because I'm tired of having my favorites filled because it's the only way I can keep them! And everyone this happens, a star in my review goes down... 😒✌🏼️"
1824,Cutiepie23💗💖💟💜,"March 17, 2016",5,Amazing I 💜 dubsmash if anyone is having a problem I think I can help but if you are putting bad reviews that's not what the people who made dubsmash want they want good reviews if you want to complain about what I say contact C'Ajha23 and please rate this 5 stars because dubsmash is amazing and u can make your own dubs who wouldn't like it is the best app where u can get funny stuff to laugh about
1825,Scarlet P.,"March 25, 2016",4,"Love app, minor issues I absolutely love this app but I have a few problems with it. The top of the screen is turning black on all of my dubs and I don't know why. Also the major issue is that my dubs save private anymore. My only options is to share it on dub talk or make it my profile dub. Although I love doll talk I don't want to send every day up to my friends. After the update everything has been going bad so far."
1826,@_pap.laayy_,"August 7, 2016",1,"I Hate This App Now Okay I've been saving up all my dubs so that I can post them later in a collage , but come to find out as I was going through my app I see that ALL OF MY DUBS are deleted and I was not going to save 1,000 something dubs to my camera roll so I thought it was safe to stay in the app . Some of my friends dubs did the same thing to them a while ago but I didn't think much of it and so next thing I know I look at mine yesterday and they're all deleted ! If I could I would give this NO STARS but I can't ! Dubsmash needs to fix this and give me back my dubs because right now I have none."
1827,Deisockeejrc,"March 1, 2017",3,My dubs were deleted 😡 Had this app for awhile. Used to be awesome. Then the audio clips got worse. Maybe they had copyright problems? Whatever. I just opened the app to quickly save one of my old dubs. It kept prompting me to log in. Didn't remember creating a log in. Attempted to but kept getting internet connect error. Figured the glitch had to be in the app itself. Opened the store and did the update. I logged in fine and all my dubs that I had are gone forever. Cool...not.

1829,queensheyshey,"October 14, 2018",3,Terrible update I love Dubsmash I have been using it for years now and all of a sudden everything changes up and it’s just horrible nothing is the same and everything is just everywhere. It’s not the same Dubsmash. As u can see ur ratings are going down because of this if ur smart you’ll fix it bc careers are ending Instagram dancers and yours soon everyone will eventually forget about this app and go back to thriller or something else do this for yourself and others thnx.
1830,Bumblebea83!,"April 19, 2015",5,So fun!! Ok I'm new to the whole video making craze but a friend posted one of these on Facebook and I just had to try it… so glad I did! Me and the kids love making videos to send to our friends and family. Some of them are explicit but as long as you screen them it fine and you can add your own sounds. Currently we are having a dubsmash war it so fun!
1831,GG real reviews,"April 25, 2015",4,"Dubsmash Dubsmash is so fun! Also so unique! It's the life of any party or play-date, my sister and I will just laugh and laugh for hours! One thing though, I wanna do the app with my family but there are so many cursing ones I probably should just delete the app. My suggestion it that in the beginning it could ask if ur okay with cursing like a settings thing. Besides the cursing, it's definetley a lot of fun! Like it could say like child mode or adult mode."
1832,Mcgrubbins,"October 1, 2015",4,"Entertaining !! Unique App, not only can you lip sync to songs, but also sound bites of popular commercials, movies, reality shows, etc.  Only issue I see right now is for occasionally the app won't let you save a completed sound bite due to not enough memory...when you know that is not true & you have a lot of memory on your phone and you haven't saved a lot of your favorites to Dubsmash either??"
1833,]{~,"October 31, 2015",5,"DubSmash-offs are FUN! My 11yr old niece & I do DubSmash-off challenges whenever she visits overnite... Her parents challenged us this last time, & surprised us by how much they got into it! They simply responded to the tag line included when we sent our 1st one out as a text mssg to them.... The battle went on for over 2hrs, both sides laughed until we cried, it was THAT entertaining! Thanx, DubSmash, for giving us such a great app!"
1834,Princess Elysa,"December 11, 2015",1,"Explicit's Are Frustrating and Disappointing I have four kids ranging from 5 to 18 who all LOVE Dubsmash! However, I have had to delete it from ALL of our devices in lieu of the explicit language. There are SO SO many fun, family-friendly dubsmashes available but when I allow them to use the app unsupervised they inevitable end up playing a clip that has either expletives and/or vulgarities that are extremely inappropriate for minors. My suggestion: either develop an app for kids (like Dubsmash Kids) or find a way to CLEARLY mark explicit clips and create a way to filter them or block them within the app."
1835,Bossynaya,"February 24, 2016",4,Should save on account The dubsmashes should be save on the account not the devices because if i lose my phone and i log in to dubsmash i would like to see the old videos/dubs from my  phone i made on new devices which mean i would like the update to be with being able to see all videos from the first time i made the account and videos from other devices that im logged into
1836,t2xjh,"May 1, 2016",2,"what happened tbh i used to love dubsmash, it was great to make dancing videos for challenges and just regular funny dubs that i could create as well. but then the new update messed everything up. its hard to understand and it crashes frequently. for example, i was trying to preview one of the sounds from a soundboard and pressed the x button because i wanted to preview to stop but it just ended up deleting the sound :( plus viewing your dubs off of your profile is difficult too and i dont see the reason why we need to chat with other people that use dubsmash and have ""friends"" on our profile. i liked dubsmash when it wasnt really classified as a social media where you had to have friends and stuff like that, you could just make your own videos and share them on ig or somewhere else. but now, its just not the same."
1837,Bri9842,"January 28, 2018",3,"Where did the MY DUBS button go??? Is there no option to just put it in ‘my dubs’ anymore? Instead of it going straight to ‘my moments’? I liked that it used to just automatically saved to ‘my dubs’ where only I could see them. Now it either goes straight where everyone can see, or I have to save it to my phone camera roll which takes up space.. so I’d like for there to be a ‘my dubs’ option again just to save for myself in the app."
1838,Kj hxhckgcj,"June 7, 2018",5,Awesome I love this game so much but I deleted it one day and could not get it back because I did not know my account and it would not let me do a new account I do not what happened I do not know what happened but I want to know but this game is really awesome Monday I actually did Robert can you turn off the counter and they mean it when I am I really like this app so thanks
1839,juju💙💙❤️❤️,"December 3, 2018",5,Dubsmash I have this app 5 points because they got all the music I like and it cool because we get to dance and I love to dance to music and my favorite songs just love this app like u guys don’t know how much I love this app can u guys make more app just like this I like this more than tik Tok this is my app like comin on and make more just like this app💙💙💙💙I’m sending all the hearts cause I just love this app❤️❤️❤️❤️
1840,Lou Burna,"February 14, 2015",4,"Great app with room for improvement! I love the app! So much fun creating hilarious vids! Works great and I like the selection of different audio files. I can see this app having future updates with better features. If they make a paid for version to remove the huge website ad on the videos, I would pay for it. Also please add an upload video feature addon, which would be a great option. Thanks!"
1841,Unicorn chom,"April 7, 2015",5,This app is so much fun!!😃😃😃 Basically what you do in this app is you pick a a voice that says something and then you record your self mimicking what they say while the other voice is playing so it sounds like you have that voice. It is soooo much fun and when you see your recordings you will laugh so much!! Hope you enjoy this app as much as I did!!!👏👏👍👍👍
1842,Kynsayyyyye,"June 22, 2015",5,I think dubsmash is great I love dubsmash cause when I'm really bored and have nothing to do I can make tons of halarious dubs. My only problem is that when I don't know what I want to make a dubsmash of all the recommended ones are lame. They need to create a popular dubsmash option that lets you do all the now popular dubsmashes. But that's my only problem. Yall should totally get this app
1843,Annebelle671,"August 2, 2015",4,Lots of laughs! I've had lots of fun with this app. I like the feature of searching for a specific topic or words. I do find a couple of irritating cons to it though. I think there should be a limit as to the number of duplicate submissions per category. So many of the same person saying the same thing or recording same song. Redundant. I also find much of the sayings and language very demeaning and offensive.
1844,Jcamp2013,"August 14, 2015",5,"Love it! The whole family loves this app, we pass the time on long car rides with family dubsmash wars.  My friends and I also have dubsmash wars on weekends when we aren't together.  Be careful though for young ones, there can be naughty words in some seemingly innocent sound clips, i.e. Sponge Bob.  The video can also lag a little, most obvious while blinking, but no big deal."
1845,luvzebras8,"November 9, 2015",4,Love it! But has problems... This app is so much fun! It could entertain me for hours! One of the problems is that there is way to much inappropriate language. I deleted this app a while ago because of it but downloaded again. Know when I go to save my video my app automatically closes and discards the video. I can't make any Dubsmash without this problem. Please fix this problem so I can have more fun🤗
1846,CaptainAmerica'sGirl,"December 22, 2015",5,"Dubsmash!!! Dubsmash is amazing!!! This is my favorite thing to do with my besties!!! If you are looking for a lot of laughs this is the app for you! Only thing, I wouldn't recommend this app for children. There is some language, so you just need to be careful what you are looking for. Overall this app is really fun and it's hilarious to watch your completed videos and make funny faces. Thanks dubsmash!"
1847,Bruinswin11,"May 3, 2016",5,AWESOME I know what people say about the updates. But It depends on which phone you have. So I uptaded dubsmash and just said to myself wow that's weird that so many people are saying ya it's okay. And what I want to say is to those people are you serious right now. Please rate this and 5 and just look at the app and say WOW I should listen to that person WOW. but otherwise it amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!    
1848,Gilbert Suriyah,"October 9, 2018",3,the updated version of dubsmash This is an review for the updated version of dubsmash with the feed and all that .. I am literally about to delete dubsmash only because of the way it’s set up and many more. Such as the quality of my camera and how my videos are saved. I liked the old version of dubsmash better may you please change it back😩. p.s. keep the my dubs on there please because i have been using the app much more with that .. Thank you 🙏🏽

1850,ClubJ-Dub,"May 23, 2015",3,"Fun app...when it works. I would give this app 5 stars because you can create some hilarious vids, however half the time I upload my own sound it gives me an error telling me to check my network connection. I only use this on WiFi. I have created a few vids and they turned out really well. If my uploads didn't error out all the time my rating would be higher. Until this is resolved I will rate this app with a conservative 3 stars."
1851,Ma Darling💋,"May 31, 2015",5,"The best decision I've... The best decision I've ever made once when I download it I never thought that I could experience something more likely like me ACTING. I downloaded it because I wanted to entertain myself, and I did! I really hope that everybody get a chance and take a walk on the diving board and splash💦 your way into a journey of Dubsmash. Hope this solved your problem. Good luck👊🏼"
1852,madison.heidrich,"June 2, 2015",5,Dub smash is the BEST I can't believe I didn't have this app sooner it is hilarious and fun to do with friends! I would highly recommend that you get this app there are no problems with it and it's free so PLEASE get this app it is like awesome! I probably make like 4-6 every day and upload them to my Instagram! This app is also great if you are creative so please stop reading this now and GO GET THE APP!!! 😎😎😎😎
1853,Tea.lee,"July 25, 2016",3,Plz help I love this app the only thing is.... I with it could do everything musically can do. Like make it fast or slow and post. I also wish we could see other peoples musicallys or dubsmash. I would love this app so much more! Plz help make this happen! Also I need more space you can only make 150 dubs and I need more! I'm not using this app if it won't allow me to make Anymore! I love making memories with my friends. Another thing it keeps crashing!! FIX NOW PLEASE!!!!!!!
1854,Rebecca Alvarado,"August 27, 2016",1,"Lost Dubbs I'm starting not to like this app more and more every day. First of all i lost all of the first Dubs that I did. There was probably over 20 of them. And they are all gone now which is pretty sad because if I had known that dub smash was going to be deleting them then I would have saved them all to my camera roll. And now when I try to make new dubs and I hit save to my dubs they're not there, it only saves a maximum of 29 dubs. So if you try to make you dubs and try to save them to my dubs on the app you can't.  The app is not getting better it's actually getting worse."
1855,BIG BAD FACTS,"May 31, 2018",3,“My Dubs” ... Ok ......so I just got dubsmash and when I went to the settings I seen “my dubs” and I was wondering how to save dubs to it. Literally I deleted the app twice and looked up how to save dubs to “my dubs “ thinking something was wrong and that my app wasn’t updated🙄 but that’s was exactly the problem- it was up to date‼️ I don’t like this!! Even though I can save it to my photos and there’s a folder named Dubsmash I would prefer to save my private dubs to “my dubs”.
1856,Jazz_dancer,"June 23, 2018",5,"Please update I want it to be able to save to my dubs. It only goes to moments. I would also like it for you to see mutual friends rather than searching for long hard names. No one can get new friends with constantly having to search usernames. Lastly, can you make it where you can see who watches the moments? Thanks in advance"
1857,Ri Haruhi,"June 30, 2018",2,"Same problems as everyone with one more I have the same issue as everyone else, that I cannot add dubs to My Dubs to keep them private. However, the biggest issue is that I cannot find any of my friends. My theory is that I can only see people who made their account before the update. My friends and I only want to send dubs privately to each other, but thats not possible if we cant add each other (despite we all have accounts). Please fix and we will begin using the app. Thank you!"
1858,nucknameN,"October 8, 2018",5,"I like the app but go back to one feature I don’t like how you guys cropped the video before it was like on portrait so u can see my whole body when I dance so, can you change it back to how the video wasn’t cropped or have different options if u want it cropped, portrait, or landscape? Or is there a way I can downgrade back to how dubsmash was before"
1859,jayyytt,"October 13, 2018",1,"Why ? Okay so I see you guys tried to fix Dubsmash because it has been acting slow since the update, but I don’t like the update it was perfectly fine how it was “ my dubs “ and having it were we can share with our friends , now that the square box is there it isn’t as great , if not want this app to turn into a musically or anything cause at this point I see were you guys are going with this and I don’t like it , I’ll appreciate and I’m pretty sure many others would appreciate you guys taking off the update & just give us our regular Dubsmash back ‼️😘"

It's a great app. There are several updates that are needed. Such as better grouping of quotes, more quotes available (will come with time I'm sure), and a Parental Control option to filter out bad language. Regardless, it still gets a FIVE STAR rating."
1861,Alexis Strong,"May 5, 2015",5,"Addictive App This may be the new snapchat, except this has the ability of the recipient to save the video once it's received.

The app can bring out your creative side."

Downloaded this fun-looking app only to realize they want all sorts of personal information to create an account (I was providing 'false info') the app then asks for access to your camera, video,pictures, first-born, etc. pretty scary. I deleted the app and went to the App Store to read up on it. READ THE PRIVCY PAGE!  The company says it will basically use your personal information any way they want. Their privacy page is based on a German privacy act, I couldn't find it in English. From personal experience Germany is all about collecting information on citizens."

I've been using Dubsmash for a while now and I think it's fun and all, but one thing I noticed: in one of your updates, you made the dubs full screen (which I like) but you made them a mirror image.  I preferred when dubs were recorded regularly and the image was flipped back to normal after recording it.  Not a fan of the whole mirror image thing.  Could you please fix this?  Thanks!"
1865,PandicornsRule!!!,"June 27, 2016",4,"1 Problem! I have just started playing this and the app is really fun!! It is a good game to play when you are bored! Only one thing though...... I have made a video and while it said that it was downloading, it exited to my home screen! When I went back on the app..... the video was GONE!! So, you should probably have a new update soon and make a ""Bug Fix""! Overall I have chosen to rate 4 stars!!"

1867,_pup.love_,"September 8, 2018",3,"Make it more like tic-tok If u add slo-mo and fast, more music, make it where u can add videos from your camera roll, more filers you will have a better app than tic-tok. You will have an app that kids that aren’t allowed to have social media can have. Just look at tic-tok and get some other ideas from there. I promise I will tell a lot of people about this app if y’all do these things. I already got a couple of people to download the app. Thanks for reading my long review❤️💕"
1868,Stepdog1,"October 9, 2018",4,"Terrible update I’m rating this a all star because I want it to be seen. The update is terrible u can’t get filters,it’s a whole different set up, you can’t get emojis, and it cuts off the bottom half of your video. So I’m advising u not to update. I thought all they were gonna do is fix some bugs that’s why I updated but if I would have know what happens then I wouldn’t have did it."
1869,angrypersonwithdubsmas,"October 18, 2018",1,"Still upset🤬 Although you gave us vertical screen back we still don’t have the option of square . You should make that an option .Also there is still no filters . We had really nice filters before but now they are gone. Lastly, we used to have the options  to do a portion of the dub then save it or record it by our selves . Now we can’t do the funny things we do because it forces us to go automatically through the sound. lol you guys are something else I still won’t use it until we get back to how it used to be ."
1870,Shane918,"February 20, 2015",5,"So much fun I have become slightly addicted to this app. My wife is getting annoyed with all the videos I keep making, but they are hilarious and fun to make. It would be great though if we could have our own profile similar to Vine as has been mentioned so others could just view and like our videos that way. Great app!"
1871,Mickmc56,"March 19, 2015",5,SO MUCH FUN! My family and friends have been sending dubs back and forth and we have literally been LOL.  My 77 year old mom has even got in on the action.  One improvement would be to start the voice a second or two after hitting the start button.  That would make the first of the recording easier to match to.
1872,Danielleabn,"June 4, 2015",3,"Fun app but needs ""explicit"" label on some of the sound bites This is a fun app.  You can browse through and make favorites to save for the future. I do find there are vulgar ones and they aren't labeled as explicit and should be. I would hate for my young kids with phones to be exposed to them. And anyway who would really want to see a Dubsmash video with such a harsh and abusive tone?  Add more filters and take out some of the random sound bites that are not really professional sounding."

So when I got a new one and downloaded dubsmash surprisingly my profile dubsmash was still there .Is there any way that I could save it?
1875,headvsheartz,"August 28, 2016",2,"Was once my favorite... I used to use this app daily for a quick laugh with friends. And then ALL of my dubs got deleted. After getting over that I decided to give it another go. And then the latest update happened, and every time I click on ""save to my dubs"" IT DOESNT SAVE TO MY DUBS. So now I've lost even MORE. There should be a ""recents"" or ""history"" area where dubs go if they don't ""save"" (especially even when you've hit...SAVE) OR make it so we can recover lost dubs! They have to be somewhere in the worldwide webs of the Internet."

That person didn’t like it but in my head i’m thinking whatever. Anyways, I don’t like this update. Please change it back. It literally cut the heads off my videos, deleted some recent ones, and i can’t even have friends on there anymore. This is a total and complete downgrade from the previous update. Please go back to the way it was before this. Also, i will continue to use the app but, i don’t like this update."
1878,nick.behnke,"October 15, 2018",2,"New update review Dubsmash was fine how it was before the update. I’m pretty sure a lot of people would like it back how it was. If y’all could get on that soon, that would be great. I don’t like how everything has been sorted into categories and some sounds that once existed don’t anymore. And how it makes you record the whole thing instead of just a snippet. Also the voice filters were cool and need to comeback. So does the feature where you could record your own sounds."
1879,Bear😜😂😏,"October 23, 2018",2,"Why did you change everything ?!? I’ve had dubsmash for years and all its done is improve up until the new update. It’s horrible i hate it. The look, the way it operates, etc. The feed is weird. I feel like they tried to copy other social media’s with it. The way you record now is annoying. i have to switch it to 5 secs every time and i honestly don’t want any of my videos public so i also have to change that. Just please re-update it back to how it ways 😭"

I have an iPhone 5s, and this app is really fun, but when I upload my own sound and click on it to record a video, it just keeps spinning and spinning and spinning. I would really like to be able to use my own sounds with this app otherwise I will probably get tired of it and delete it off of my phone. Please fix it soon! Thanks!"
1882,Corey's Titanic,"November 27, 2015",5,"Addictive and hilarious!! My brother got it a while back and kept trying to get me to try it and I finally did late on Thanksgiving day. I laughed and laughed...at myself and the sound clips! Oh, it was hilarious! He and I made several videos together and some of just ourselves till late at night...and we definitely had way too much fun!! 😄"
1883,RenJ44,"March 25, 2016",5,"Dubsmash is a hit in our house We love Dubsmash. It is fun for the whole family. I love seeing the creative dubsmashes my kids find and record. Our only issue is the songs that are inappropriate or have been made inappropriate. I wish there was a way to monitor, remove or mark songs that have inappropriate content!"
1884,Lil dude1267😛,"April 9, 2016",5,Amazing but needs update I like almost everything about this app but the one thing that I wish you can do is use a video already in your photo album and find a way to make the dubsmash in the corner go away. It would have to be like $0.99 but worth it! Anyways other than that it's a pretty cool app
1885,Horselove1243,"April 30, 2016",2,"Erases?!?!!?!? I went on this app as the most excited person in the world for the new update, but I left an extremely sad a dissatisfied person. This is because I have tried EVERYTHING to get to my old dubs, and they've just been erased! This is so sad for me to give this review because Dubsmash was like, my favorite app ever, I had so much progress and great dubs that have been erased!! Please, tell me how to get those dubs back, I worked so hard for so many dubs and there all gone...😫😰. I really used to love this app, replace my love, please!"

1887,Manda7030,"January 11, 2018",1,"Won’t save finished work I tried doing a dub ten times over and saving it and every time I went to my dubs, it wasn’t there. After I saved it, I even tried tapping on the “view here now” bar that pops up on the top and it took me to an old dub that I had done. I tried closing out of the app and doing it again and it didn’t work. I even deleted it and re-downloaded it and it still didn’t work. Needless to say, there’s some major bugs if you can’t even share your finished product let alone watch again after you’re done."
1888,DEJHAREIW,"October 12, 2018",1,"the update is so bad!! It doesn’t have filters, and the screen is way too small. it’s confusing and the formatting is so difficult to work with. this used to be a fun app that i actually loved working with but i think i might actually download triller or something. might even go as low as to getting tic tock or whatever musically is called now. It’s frustrating and i definitely wouldn’t recommend downloading after the most recent update. i’m deleting the app if there isn’t a change because overall the app is not good at all."
1889,Gabrielle1118,"October 17, 2018",5,I love Dubsmash but you need to go back to the old version of Dubsmash I have always loved Dubsmash but this new update is trash. Its very confusing and when I try to save my video full screen it doesn’t work. Could u pls change it back to how it was before because the new update very confusing for no reason
1890,Lisa Baby-Daddy,"May 10, 2015",5,"Awesome App I love this app soooo much ! When I downloaded the app I spent at least 45 mins laughing at myself. All afternoon I been sending vids to my friends ,and  now all my friends are using the app. We have a dub smash group where we send each other funny videos . We are dub smash famous! Lol 😂😂. I recommend a group a friends should download this app. So much fun!!! 👍👍"
1891,Howtodudes,"May 19, 2015",4,"So great! One problem though This app is so great, and tons of fun! I use it all the time to amuse myself and others. Sometimes it can be hard to find a quality sound, but once you do it's fun! "
1892,Hello Tobuscus!,"May 22, 2015",4,"Update I absolutely love this app. It's is so fun to mess around with and play with when your bored in the waiting room and people think you're crazy. Haha I'm kidding. But recently my dubs aren't saving to ""my dubs"" when I press next. Now I HAVE to save it to my camera roll and press finish. I used to just be able to press next and go back and it'd be saved. I'd like this fixed and I'll be one happy camper."
1893,Jump4py,"January 18, 2016",5,Make someone smile I love this app. I can send a message and cheer up someone in need of a smile or laugh. Plus you can work on your acting skills. 
1894,Ayoo.NAIJA💙💜💚❤️,"May 2, 2016",5,Updates are the worst Every time they update dubs mash it's more confusing and   Dub smash is really fun but when you upgrade it makes it more confusing and people don't want to get on it as much. Just keep it simple  nobody trying to be worried about how to figure out how to work  dubs mash They  just want to dance. not to speak for the crowd or Nun so yeah
1895,FlyingbytheSeatofmyPants,"June 28, 2016",4,Problems now Love love love this app but it has begun freezing my iPhone 6s running IOS 9.1.2 I think. I have to power down. The video is there but something is not right. 
1896,Da Qtip,"October 17, 2016",2,"Good app needs fixes Fun app but the search definitely needs improved. Also, not everything I favorite is being saved and the biggest problem is the fact that I can't save most of my videos. Right after recording I keep getting an error and the clip is lost. :( please fix! Users cannot dubsmash like this. This is still a big issue even after the latest update. A pop up tells me to make sure I have Internet connection when I do, a full 3 bars."
1897,Lae<3,"May 30, 2018",1,"Bad Changes! After a month of two of not using dubsmash i notice you guys had disable the option to save a video to “My Dubs”. This ultimately made me use the app less, not to mention there is no longer the option to edit videos with emojis or gif like features and just a small sentence like it used to be. I also realized that when i go back to review some only dubs the videos are not playing or disorganized, unlike when they were originally made or saved. Please fix these features so we can have Dubsmash back!"
1898,NastyNastynas,"October 17, 2018",1,New update I don’t like the update..... the previous version is better😑 i personally use dubsmash only for dancing. The friends got taken away so now I can’t even see what they put on dub smash. Also I don’t like the way the videos automatically crop to square and when you make it it flips the other way... I like having a full screen when I dance and for the screen to be normal and not flipped like a camera. I’m currently trying to figure out how to change it back to the previous version now but if I can’t I’m deleting the app ✌🏽
1899,Bri Shells,"November 28, 2018",5,Glitches while i enjoy creating dancing videos on Dubsmash it gets really annoying when i work hard on a dance it glitches all throughout the video. I’ve been checking and checking for an update because maybe it can stop the glitching but i don’t even know anymore!
1900,Kchindlu,"April 12, 2015",5,This app is tiiiight This is my favorite app on my phone! I live 2000 miles away from two of my best friends and it's a hilarious way for us to still make each other laugh! Get this app it rocks. My only critique is that I wish there were in app profiles so you could look at all the videos your friends have made!
1901,Beatlelover7,"May 5, 2015",5,"Dubsmash This app is very fun to use for any given moment. Ask any friend or relative that has downloaded the app. Sounds are very distinct sometimes never tiresome. Have to be good at timing and recording. Dubsmash should have a timer so sounds and movements won't be late or too early. Otherwise, everyone should have dubsmash in their phone even if it's temporary."
1902,Hiwhatsupilovethings,"June 25, 2015",4,PLEASE READ! Please!!!!! Ok so I actually love this app. I think it's great! It's fun for all the family! Although I can't give it five stars because there are a few inappropriate sounds. Like ones with bad words and bad content. But if you just push those aside you can make really good use of this app. I use it to cheer up my friends when their sad! Me and my sister love this app! It is totally worth the download.
1903,Leilani95,"June 27, 2015",2,"Super fun!! But now super glitchy. This app used to be so much fun! With adding your own sounds, the possibilities were endless! I liked adding my own sounds because then i could select exactly which part i wanted to do. "
1904,Unicorn dog eyes,"July 21, 2015",5,Amazing some suggestions So everything is so awesome I don't have any problems so far I only have some suggestions. 1: make it like vine where you can post dubs on dubsmash for other users to see. 2: put words or lyrics so we know what we have to say😂 3: make it like vine so you can stop & start the video at any time
1905,Kris-Kris99,"February 13, 2016",4,"New update request I really like the new update (even considering so many hate it) I was wondering if in the next update you could add a tool to draw onto the dubs like snapchat?? I would love to see that happen!! I say this because I like to have a personal touch to my dubs and I'm not a huge fan in filters. If you could make my wish come true, that would be AWESOME!!! Thank you!!"
1906,QueenShanane,"July 31, 2016",1,"DO NOT UPGRADE I downloaded the new upgrade to ""remove bugs"" and now all of my dubs are gone!! If that weren't bad enough, I can't click on and listen to a sound bite, some I can't click on at all, and every page has the same sound bites even though it has a different category,like trending or funny etc.  I went from an awesome app that I loved and used all the time with no bugs to something I can't even use anymore! Store your dubs to your camera roll while you have the chance so they don't get deleted and do not upgrade!"
1907,PianoStar20,"October 6, 2018",4,"Fun but... I like how the “My Dubs” is back but what is frustrating is now you can’t pause to either change style or scene, or if you forget, you only get one shot, I used to do a lot with half of it with glasses on and the other glasses off but now I can’t pause in between to do that, I would really hope you can add that feature back. Otherwise it’s a great app!"
1908,AWOLPSYCHO325,"October 6, 2018",1,"Terrible update The app is super fun to use but the update just ruined it. The new search method makes it extremely hard to find the sound your looking for, I remember searching the exact same things and seeing something completely different. They also went back to just having the square instead of full portrait mode, which I don’t think anyone is happy about. And to top it all off, the big obnoxious watermark is back. It may have been there before, but now it’s much more noticeable. Please fix this, Dubsmash"
1909,aaliyah458,"October 10, 2018",3,Bigger screen to record and clearer quality! Love the new update guys I just would love the app way more if it was more clearer when I save it to my gallery and when I record my regular camera and my dumbsmash camera looks like two different camera and I want it to be more room so I can make dubs with a lot of people I only can fit one person now so make the recording full screen if you can please and thank you
1910,Slaaaayin😍😅,"May 29, 2015",5,Dubsmash problems😭 I love dubsmashes alot i just finished doing them with My friend but THE thing is is that i pressed next and it usually saves it to My dubs so i went to My dubs and i didnt save i was very dissapointed and sometimes is says there is an error about saving it to my camera role and all of my pictures were deleted i just dont get it
1911,Ezio auditore da firanze,"May 25, 2016",3,Dubsmash or snapchat? Not sure if it's a dubsmash or a copy of a snapchat🤔 The only difference between them is in dubsmash you cannot click a photo and in snapchat you cannot dub your video. The interface of dubsmash is also similar to snapchat. Why are you guys keep updating (destroying) your app and making it difficult to use when your old version was easy and awesome? Please bring back the old version.
1912,LOTRluvr7777777,"July 11, 2016",4,"Please change a few things... I love the app can you change a few things please??? We need the filters and makes the final Dub look cool!!!

Thanks love the app anyway please add these for me and the other users😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘"
1913,K9Krunchies,"August 1, 2016",1,"Please Help! This a very fun and entertaining app, however, when opening it after being away for awhile I came to find that almost all of my ""dubs"" were deleted. I am very unhappy about this because many of them contained sweet moments between my infant son and I and were also very entertaining. What is even more peculiar; my husband's ""dubs"" are all still intact and available to him after the same amount of time (if not more) of being away. If this can be fixed I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise I would give 5 stars."
1914,🤓🙃💗#ωσм∂єя,"November 29, 2016",3,Meh-3 star rating😐😐😐 It's ok I guess. I think it should have more quality sounds. There should be a better selection of sounds to lip sinc to. There are so many glitches when I am looking at my past dub videos. I would like to bring back the selection of saving my dubs privately and not having to share it in my moments all the time as other users are saying.  The updates are not bad. But they are not good either.
1915,Naenaeduhhdummy,"September 30, 2017",3,I haven’t even got to try it It lets me do one but when it’s done it pauses and sends me home or to my home screen ☹️😭 my cusin has it but I can’t even try it I see so many people with it and I think all man I can’t even get into it 😡. I thought 💭 I would give this 5 stars ✨ but noo I couldn’t even do that you need to fix this problem because I have a iPhone 📱 or iPod 📱 but it still won’t work for me two stars ✨ it is
1916,Nia🤪,"February 19, 2018",1,Tending For some reason the tending has been having the same songs for weeks and I thought it was just my phone but my friends are having the day problem and this is really aggravating because I want to dance to tending sounds but it want let me because it needs to be updated so I am asking you to fix this problem because it has been happing for a long time and I really am starting to dislike it because of that problem. When I downloaded an app I expect it to work and not mess up like this
1917,London Swindell,"August 1, 2018",5,No dubs Dubsmash is acting weird when I opened the app and went to see my friends dubs there dubs weren’t there nor were mine and when I went to go look for my favorite sounds it was none in there so y’all need to fix this and bring back the old one or sum cuz it’s lagging and NO it’s not my phone it’s the app
1918,Brianna.@,"October 23, 2018",3,Well ... theirs another thing The app is cool n all like the new update is great but when I want to look up certain songs or clips I can’t find it . Instead it uploads other things that I’m not looking for and never known existed. I feel like the creators or people who helped upgrade the app deleted it from the create button but I’m not sure . So I hope you guys could fix that please maybe in your next upgrade .
1919,Mizz SDP,"November 18, 2018",5,This is one of my main apps on my phone I love Dubsmash. I was a fan of it since like 2016. It’s one of the main apps I go on everyday. The best part of this app is that you can choose different sounds and post LIT VIDS. The one problem is I can’t follow or add people anymore😭😭. But hopefully we can get that feature back shortly.
1920,Iirebekah,"April 23, 2015",4,So ridiculous but so fun. This app is so ridiculous but it is so much fun simple and easy to use. Can do anything from lip syncing to dub short sayings. My only complaint is that there is no feed that you can see other peoples dubs. It would be fun to have a social interaction like IG or vine where you can upload and share in the app and you can see other people who create them.
1921,whitch stick,"May 5, 2015",4,"My abs are sore from laughing :D This is the most fun I have ever had! I didn't get anything done today on my to do list, but it was definitely worth it.  It's fun to just be immature and play around with it. So great.  My only complaint is the language in some of the audio. I would rather not hear the f word or crud like that. If the language was cleaned up, I would give this app 5 stars for sure."
1922,Thestorewasclosedtoday,"May 22, 2015",4,"Funny update I really love this app, even started a Facebook message group for everyone to have a place to share them but as of yesterday, my dubs no longer saved to ""My Dubs"". I enjoy doing a bunch back to back and going back to post though them later or showing friends but now they're just gone. Fix this and it would be a 5 star app!"
1923,Christina22293,"May 26, 2015",4,So fun but only saves to phone I love the app but I don't like that the videos only save to my phone. If I sign into my Instagram or snapchat all my history is saved but if I sign into my dubsmash on a different phone all my videos are gone. What's the point in having to sign in if it doesn't even save my videos to my own account? Would give 5 stars if it saved
1924,nsk1999,"May 27, 2015",4,"amazing app, but… whenever i'm done with a dubsmash recently, they don't save! i make a lot of dubsmashes but unless there's a limit to the amount getting saved to the app, i don't know why they haven't been saving. i tried deleting a couple but they still don't save. if there is a limit, I would appreciate if you please make that so there is no limit. thanks!"
1925,Bobert the dude,"May 31, 2015",4,Good app but.... This app is really fun and hilarious but when little kids want to make a dub there is a whole bunch that swear in them so that really disappoints me. I don't know who would want their kids listening to people swearing. Why would something have to swear or be inappropriate to be really funny?! But really good app overall I love it. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
1926,Darkhero76,"August 16, 2015",5,"Lots and lots of choices Is really fun that I have more then 100 of them. There is so much choices that I sometimes can't choose just one. I will do 30 in one day! If like jokes and playing around u should get this app. Oh there is scenes from movies and shows. Finally, more than one person can do this app!!!!🐽😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😒"
1927,Should be on a different game,"October 26, 2015",5,The best game ever I love this game it doesn't seem to take up a lot of space and it is hilarious and I love how you can make your own voices but I don't recommend for kids that don't know curse words or anything like that because they will be exposed other than that it is probably my favorite app on my device
1928,Ritacakkes,"October 28, 2015",4,"Hours of entertainment This app is great for those who are bored and need to kill time then you end up with hilarious videos you can look back on. Two things I would change though. Tags on the dubs so we could more easily find them if we don't have the exact name. And also a symbol for ""explicit"" content, so I know which ones I don't want (e.g.; foul language)"
1929,thegirlwhoUSEDtolikedubsmash,"July 17, 2018",1,"Bring MY DUBS BACK and fix glitches I don’t like how they took away my dubs bc I don’t wanna save all my dubs to my camera roll and I don’t wanna save my dubs to my moments for everyone to see I just wanna be able to save them privately within the app, also when I press the countdown to record a video with no hands and it plays the video back it glitches after the first 2 seconds and keeps repeating the first 2 seconds so I gave to hold it down for 1 second and then use the countdown to record or else the video will glitch"

1931,Natalie Valadez,"April 12, 2015",4,"Amazing but one suggestion! I love this app ! It's amazing but I just have ONE teenie tiny suggestion, everything is perfect, the dubs are funny, the qualities great, i love how you can add those stickers and text but I think dubsmash would be 100% better if when you used the front camera there would be a front facing flash, it would make life so much easier. Thanks for your time."
1932,Futureglimpse,"April 17, 2015",5,Love it I think this app is so fun that I am actually taking the time to write a review. That doesn't happen. 
1933,anastasiaub,"May 20, 2015",1,"Awful So many glitches, the people who work for dub smash are trying to trick their customers! Every time I finish making a hilarious recording, when I try to save it a message appears. It gives me 2 options ""Not now"" or ""like us on Facebook"", the not now button doesn't work. It won't let you save it until you like them on face book ( so desperate for likes I guess ) and when you go onto to face book try to exit and go back to dub smash the recording is lost. This app is so disappointing in customer service."

I have fun with the old heavy metal selections making the videos and sending them back and forth with an old buddy.

1939,teego.primeee,"October 21, 2018",2,"Fix it now‼️. Change it back to how it previously was. Sorry, but this new update is COMPLETELY trash. I opened the app one day full of energy to see that it’s changed. When I was ready to record my video there where no get any filters, and the screen is smaller so all of me doesn’t fit into it anymore.

1950,totalburn05,"April 1, 2015",5,You'll entertain yourself for hours Downloaded it...haven't stop using the app for the entire day. I've somehow managed to respond to all my texts and via hilarious short video clips...I can always find a sound clip that matches my conversation. Great app to pass the time with and make people laugh.
1951,Baananas,"April 11, 2015",4,"One thing that's annoying. I love it overall , but like I can only make one video each time before the advertisement of ""like us on facebook"" comes and even though I had already liked it before. It doesn't go away. And I would have to wait a few hours before it clears again. And repeat the same thing."
1952,Bladtez,"June 22, 2015",3,"Awesome app but has one problem The app is awesome and I love it. Wish the app could extend the time for uploading sounds. So the problem is that when you are uploading a sound and go back cause you change your mind, the sound will keep playing no matter what you do unless you restart the app. It's annoying to have to restart the app after or changing your mind of uploading."
1953,Karissamarie,"June 30, 2015",4,Good app I really enjoy this app. It's really fun to do with friends and it's funny. I think their should be lyrics that show up on the screen though because I don't know how many times I have to keep starting over just because I messed up because I was unable to remember what was said. But other than that it's one of my favorite apps!! :)
1954,Bomberryan,"July 4, 2015",5,Dubsmash I think Dubsmash deserved a five star because it's a very fun game and it's interesting how you get to act like your actually saying the dubs. Also very good creativity!
1955,smileygirl@:),"February 26, 2016",5,"😂💯👍🏽 LUH IT xo I luh 💋 this app so much. It is adorable, funny and sweet. You can lip dub your favorite lines from anywhere in the media ;)"
1956,Mandi308,"July 20, 2016",4,"update deleted my dubs but now they are back weird. all were gone when I logged in after update, but went back on and now they are there. completely out of order but there. should have a better way to go through them all than just scrolling through them."
1957,user of dubsmash,"September 4, 2016",1,"hacked my account got hacked and now their leaking my number all in the dub chats im get unknown phone calls and voicemails saying that they gonna come fight me and cursing me out. So can yall have another update or have a place where you can change password so people can not hack other people people are calling me with death threats and leaving disrespectful voicemails can u change dubsmash back to where we couldn't chat to anybody just record ourselfs dancing becaouse people on dubsmash are rude,disrespectful,and hackers. Hope you do something about it.😤😑"
1958,datgirl😜,"July 4, 2018",3,"Needs improvements I love Dubsmash but I feel it could be improved. I wish it had Slow-mo and fast options. I also wish they had face filters like Snapchat so that while doing my dubs I could have a dog faced filter or a rainbow above my head filter. Also, when I tried to make my own sound I could not, I tapped on my sound several times and it unfortunately did not work."
1959,sxpreme.kamikaze,"October 9, 2018",5,I love this app I love this app it inspired be to be a dancer it is amazing I like making Dubsmashes and posting it to my ig but it would be better if it posted the good videos of peoples choice and it would be good if they showed how to do some dance moves if you don’t know how to do it but hopefully you will take me advice and yea I really love this app bye
1960,DestinyDiazLovesFood,"June 18, 2015",5,Great I love this app but when some people do dances with the songs for example Twayne-Nasty or something with their friend they can't do the dance and just have to do the whip or something 😂 so I think y'all should put something that we have to wait like 3-5 seconds to start so we can be ready.
1961,Elegiac Bonita,"June 19, 2015",5,This my APP called it!!!! OMG this app is like the bomb not even kidding like fr me and my friends love playing this thing and my family loves it to it's so funny and I love it !!😘😝😝😝😝😝😝😘😘😘😘😘😝😝😝😘You guys gotta get this app take it from me even if u don't know me lol but seriously don't just pass bye this app like its dirt cause it ain't just saying well gtg bye!!😘🙆🏻
1962,Baldwin01,"August 15, 2015",4,Needs one fix for the update I would totally give this app a 5 star if it came with some sort of icon on each dubsmash that had fowl language. It would be nice to know what you were getting yourself into when you click the play button. There are some that are just not appropriate and teens use this app!!!
1963,Prettygirl5142,"November 14, 2015",5,"Awesome This game is so awesome. I could take swag videos, funny videos, and more. Plus, you can send your videos to anyone you want. A lot of my friends have this app and we talk about it every day in school. We talk about if you did this video and since some of the videos are really funny we laugh!"
1964,@ luul.emily,"July 24, 2016",3,Read me 😐 . 1 . ) Im highly upset that the update removed my dubsmashes 😒 .
1965,Stirlingite14,"September 17, 2016",4,"GAAAAAAH I spend a really long time making intricate dubsmashes sometimes, and then when I save them they're a little off, like during the saving process the audio shifted or something. At first I thought it was my own fault, but it keeps happening over and over and I'm SICK OF IT. Other than that though, I love this app and I'm never deleting it."
1966,Haylie.marie,"October 19, 2016",1,"LIVID!!!! I have had this app for well over a year now and have created well over a hundred videos with my family and friends, lots of stuff I didnt save anywhere else because of storage reasons... and well.. I figured I could trust the app. In the last update they deleted EVERYTHING. Every single memory I have created with people for over a year on there is GONE. This was my families favorite app so we did these EVERYWHERE we went and they deleted ALL OF THEM. I suppose I cannot get any of these back, so this app is permanently DELETED."
1967,SilentarrowKG,"August 14, 2017",5,This update somehow recovered all my Dubs?!? I used to have a ton of Dubs but then oneday half just all Disappered! I logged in then out then in then out and they never came back. That happened at the Top of this month. (March 2017) but ever since I updated to this version all of them came back! I'm so happy!
1968,blazin.moods❤️🤤,"October 7, 2018",5,"Go back to the old dubsmash😭 It’s terrible , I hate it’s in the square motion , you can’t use filters, and you can’t even put your @ nomo , it’s so confusing and the app really got ugly plz fix it and go back to the old version , because I’m not the only person who is upset by this"
1969,qazwsxfuck,"October 13, 2018",1,"Wow..🤦🏾‍♀️ Dude it’s all cool I guess, but can you guys please not cut most of our body out? Like this is what’s going to make me use a different app because you guys wanted to “make a change” and I don’t think you’re making much of a change seeing how you have three stars☺️, but that’s not my problem, all I gotta say is too much change can cause a riot and I’m at the point where I’m going to another app starting today until you fix these issues please. Also **(These aren’t just my opinions by the way.😬)**"
1970,_👊dantejames👊_,"January 31, 2015",3,Pretty cool I really like this app but please put a function to remove the water mark. Also it would be cool if the video function was something like vine like press down to record or you could switch back and forth from normal to that. Also the make your own dub isn't working for me and I have an iphone5c with ios8. Also the video quality comes out really crappy. That's about it though.
1971,Lava red45,"May 6, 2015",3,"Facebook issues This is one of my favorite apps. my friends and I like to send each other's videos to each other but sometimes I can't do that because it says to like them on Facebook. I have already liked the dubsmash Facebook page and the back button doesn't work, so I can't save or send any of my videos. please fix this because it ruins the app for a lot of people"
1972,KelBee:),"May 19, 2015",5,Love it! Just got it and I'm already having so much fun with it! I would love if they could make even more specific categories. For ex: a Disney movie category that has a bunch of films and when you click on a specific film you find popular quotes from that movie! Just an idea! :) but love it!! Thanks!
1973,Littleirishrose,"July 22, 2015",5,"Dubsmash App Absolutely LOVE this App. My daughter got me hooked. We had a group text the other night and it totally entertained all of us. It saved me money cause normally that would have been a movie rental night for me, but that night was better than watching a movie. Again....LOVE this App. Thank you for so much fun !"
1974,kimtobes,"November 2, 2015",4,Very fun. Lots of inappropriate language though for young kids Very fun app and we are enjoying it. Only complaint is lots of offensive language including racist language that you wouldn't know until you hit play to hear the quote. I found myself editing on the fly with my kids. Make a category and dump profanity into that please. Other than that very fun.
1975,Savior of Hyrule,"May 8, 2016",3,"Great, but the update ruined it for me. The app is awesome, I absolutely love it! However with this recent update I have grown less fond of the app. First the camera won't let you record in landscape. It's so annoying!! Also the layout makes it so much more difficult to watch old dubs. I liked it better when you could scroll through them. Change it back plllleeeaaaaassssseee!!"
1976,Shaunyay,"May 13, 2016",2,To many Three is really to many updates and people are starting to not use and not want to be on dubsmash because of it and I love dubsmash but I'm not going to keep using it if it gets updated every two-three day it's a little no not a little a lot of the time being wasted and you really just need to stop making all these updates and let us people get some time to  adjust to this apps updates please stop updating 🙄😩

1980,LaurynHill,"February 19, 2015",3,What happened? I absolutely loved this app but recently as I try to search a video it'll say there's an error or when I try to make an account it'll say the same thing. I figured it'll go away eventually or if I delete it it'll be fixed when I redownload the app but no. I really would love for you guys to fix this problem or let me know why out of nowhere it just stopped working..
1981,Cchaynes05,"May 3, 2015",5,So much fun with family It is a lot of fun when me and my family converse through it. Some things could be more original. And something's have not been posted in there yet. But overall good pass time with family that live in different states.
1982,Fabawesome,"May 7, 2015",5,"Okay.. But.. I think it's great but there's a problem. My friend has this app, and she got to have like this unicorn horn that moved when she moved, she told me how to get it, but she said it was the guys face to press, but whenever I try to press it, it always presses the done button. So please fix that but overall it's okay."

1984,Kona 25,"June 24, 2015",3,"Great app--but annoying glitch I love the DubSmash app itself, but on my iPhone, it will jump to a screen that asked you ""Do you like DubSmash??...and no matter what you answer, it keeps going back to that question screen, and you can't get out of it!  I have deleted the app over five times and reloaded it, and it keeps happening after the first couple times you use it. Ridiculous."
1985,IHATEWORLDCRAFT,"July 14, 2015",2,"Give me a break Oh my gosh are you kidding me. People are messed up, and caught up with cussing that is just horrible to say. The creators of this app should do something about this. Seriously. If you are reading this don't get the app there's more than just cussing that gets on my nerves. yes there are a few funny or goofy ones to do but really. I'm a Christian a strong believer in God. Now you see how I capitalized God well these people don't. I'm standing up for what's right, hopefully you will too!!!!"
1986,HonestOpinoin051104,"January 15, 2016",4,"Only one thing... I really wish it just had more sounds and I'm not saying it doesn't have any good ones or anything but I just wish they had some more. I also wish you could cut out the inappropriate sounds because I wouldn't want a young child playing a bad one. But otherwise, your game is awesome and I loooooovvvvveeee it!!!"
1987,KINGJae55,"December 16, 2016",5,"Came Back I used this app when it first came out, had to stop because I did become too busy to come up with any more ideas. When I came back, it became even better and more easy to use in just over a year of hiatus. Amazingly well done."

1989,Is_that_her,"October 15, 2018",4,1 more thing I think the updates added were amazing but I think that people who use Dubsmash should be able to make the whole screen fit there device instead of only having half of there body in the recording.  I hope these changes can be made.  💙
1990,Nicolaslind,"January 28, 2015",4,I sense a new social media sensation! This app is a really cool idea. Honestly this app could pass as the new Vine. It has a lot of potential and developers/makers of this smart idea should make it a social media app! One that you can view other participants videos! Some of them are really funny and could potentionally be made with different sounds that are insync to the senerio occurring. Great Idea!
1991,Dameetis,"February 6, 2015",5,Next social network trend! Probably one of the best apps I've ever downloaded next to Instagram! This app opens up so many doors for aspiring actors and the database for sounds is almost endless. Great app! Could be 5 stars of it didn't keep crashing though once that becomes fixed this app is going to skyrocket 🚀
1992,Trolplolo,"March 22, 2015",5,Dubsmash is awesome I love the fact that i can sound like the famous thing everyone says in school! I like that fact that if i cant mouth the words i can say it out loud to make it look better and dubsmash blocks out my voice so it can look way better! Thank you for making dubsmash❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
1993,NE Mom35,"April 9, 2015",5,"So much FUN!! My son showed me this hilarious video dub app and I can't quit playing with it! It's so funny & many choices to never get boring. If I had to say one negative thing, it would be to keep the really nasty ones out. Like ""F--- my p----. ""F---it hard"" (or something like this) for example is not appropriate for many, let alone a teenager."
1994,A humble iPhone user,"April 12, 2015",5,"Great app This app is so fun. There is no other app like it that I know of. I have spent countless hours making videos with the kids I watch, as well as by myself in my spare time. Not only is there a wide array of songs and sayings to choose from, you can upload your own. Highly recommended."
1995,Clara the gymnast chick,"July 15, 2015",4,Great but what? So I love this app and I use it all the time and it's amazing but (this just started today) when I try to search certain things it goes to my home screen and when I re-open the app it's like I closed it in the first place. Idk what's wrong with it and if it's just me or what but if it is someone wright a review too so I know I'm no alone
1996,trtrtrtr101010,"March 12, 2016",2,"Can't connect to iTunes Dubsmash was great until the most recent update. Now I can't record from iTunes, the option has disappeared completely without notice. I went to delete and reinstall the app thinking it may be a glitch. Upon reinstalling ALL of my dubs were gone- so save them to your camera roll! The sound recordings were still there but the videos were gone. Dubsmash is useless without recording iTunes."
1997,I'm.nique,"May 2, 2016",5,New update keep crashing the app I give dubsmash a 5 star cause it's a great app but ever since the new update every time I pick a sound and click the record button my iPad crashes and the videos are harder to view and it just needs to go back to normal 😭🙄❗️
1998,Worst Sister,"October 5, 2018",1,Im So Freakin Mad I HATE this update 🤬 I don’t like it at all 😭 it is so much work just to record yourself and the fact that y’all updated it to this piece of garbage 🗑 what is wrong with y’all. I can’t even recorded my whole body because y’all updated. Like are y’all serious and the fact is I can’t even even save to my camera roll without doing a whole but my videos are always blurry. So u should take my Advice and change it back the way it was and make my videos nonblurry. 
1999,lifeofbeauty✨,"October 22, 2018",1,"This app is boring now🤬 Without the little square , Dubsmash was fine the way it was , I’m 15 and I go on Dubsmash everyday to make a dance video now I can only get half of the moves"
2000,Amar khimji,"February 7, 2015",4,Good app but needs a few fixes The app is great fun to use and you can find almost anything you want on it ranging from old to new. The 2 issues I faced are that i cannot add new sounds to the library and that sometimes the application just closes without any notice. Please fix these issues to make it better for us.
2001,MahEdits=),"February 20, 2015",5,Good app 😁👏👌😏😋👑 Its a good app i can make short video clips but it can be better if there was a pause button or when i want to make a video to be longer than 5 seconds cause imake longer videos 😁✋ but besides that i love this app it downloaded in less than a minute ! 😋👏
2002,Bluestew,"May 21, 2015",4,Video Lip Syncing for Us A friend posted a quick video of her and her daughter performing a scene from the Wizard of Oz. I could tell they rehearsed it and memorized their lines. I was blown away when I found out that they used dubsmash to make the video. I downloaded it right away and now I'm having a lot of fun with it. You're going to have and share a lot of laughs.
2003,Grace is graceful wows,"June 17, 2015",5,Best game ever!!! Really fun and easy. Hundreds of songs to pick from. Just awesome. You can write words on your video and change what shade of color the video is. You can even make you own songs or use them from your songs and videos. You can put decorations on your video. It is AWESOME!!!!!
2004,Twegles,"June 22, 2015",5,"Great, but... I think they should add the feature of being able to add your own video from your own camera roll instead of just being able to make a video at the moment. Besides that, this app is absolutely amazing and hilarious! 😂☺️"
2005,Strawberry 37,"June 27, 2015",5,I LOVE IT THIS APPPPPP!!! 😂😂 This app is SOOOO amazing. Phones are so boring when no one is else on them because u can't text! Or be on social media        cites ! But this app is so kool because u can be alone and do it and make yourself laugh 😂😂. 
2006,Zoi99,"January 28, 2016",4,"It's great but... I love dubsmash!! I have so much fun with it. All the vines and videos that you can do is amazing.

Overall it is a great app and I do recommend it. 😄👌🏼👍🏻🎬"
2007,Armygirl0604,"May 26, 2016",1,"For the love of god stop updating! App is so incomprehensible it's ridiculous. What happened to the old interface? Easy to use, and you could add sounds from your iTunes. You can't even pause sounds anymore if you don't want them, the app won't let you scroll until a track is done. Means if a kid is around and the dub starts swearing you have to close the whole app to escape it. It's ridiculous. Bring back dubsmash from a year ago, I can do everything you offer these days on snapchat. 😒"

Whenever I see a dubsmash on Instagram that someone has posted or anything like that, I would like to make that dubsmash but I cannot because I do not know the name of it. There has been so many dubsmashes I would like to make. I think there should be a title next to the watermark."

I'm not the only this happen too it happen to my friend the same thing couldnt take videos so she deleted but I have so many good videos so I don't want to delete the app please fix!!!!!!! Don't ignore!!"
2011,GraceW,"April 15, 2015",5,"My favorite app! 1 request. This app is such a great idea-and absolutely hilarious. My only request is that there be a requirement to identify recordings with an expletive. Some titles seem innocent enough, but then you play them, and an expletive screams through your phone."
2012,Jon713,"June 11, 2015",5,"Its kinda addictive :) I really love it !, it's amazing you can lip sing to the Greatest voices such Luciano Pavarotti, etc...

Will be if you guys could add like a self timer , 3,5,7 10 seconds perhaps , it'll be much helpful!, specially if it's just yourself making a Dubsmash !"
2013,Loveginagirl30,"September 11, 2015",5,Love it! I seriously can't stop making videos and sending them out to family and friends !!! Would be ever better if somehow the words could flow across the screen when recording some of the really long ones.

2015,MrTJL71,"March 31, 2016",4,"Fun App I enjoy this App and would give it 5 Stars if it wasn't for the fact that sometimes when your viewing your profile and the different Videos you created, they will at times freeze when watching them. However, this does not happen all the time."
2016,Pnutmom,"December 28, 2016",5,Love it!! I personally love this app. My friends and I get a kick out of making silly videos. The fact that they are short is a bonus.

2017,Tiffy 🤤🧡,"January 4, 2018",5,"Bring save to my dubs back 🙄 I love the app ❤️. I just don’t like saving Dubsmashes straight to my gallery. It takes up too much space.

I seriously love this app and all the little things it has to offer! so many funny sounds and lines that are recognizable and just plain awesome!! I would love the app even more if it was a bit more organized. I find it to be very confusing looking for a specific one or category! but overall a great and fun app! love it!:)
2021,Kmplatt94,"April 16, 2015",2,"Explicit words I would give this a 5 star. The reason I'm giving this a 2 for the explicit words. The age for this is 12yrs old & older. My son is 12, but I do not want him to make videos with the F... Word in it. Nothing about drinking and talking about your private parts. Either you need to change the age or put the explicit words in one category that needs a password to get in it. This is fun & funny, but kids do not need to make videos with explicit words in it"

2024,MintDani,"June 23, 2015",1,Would be great if it worked for me. I've seen tons of my friends videos from this app so I decided to download it. When i tried to register it said there was already an account with that email address. Funny because I've never used this app before. So I clicked forgot password. It said it sent an email but I never got it. Tried again and again. Then tried registering with a really old email address. Same thing. This app would be great if I could actually register or sign in.

2027,Slumpedddd,"October 11, 2018",1,I hate this dumb new update Can y’all change it back because this new update is stupid...💯
2028,rickaiya,"October 13, 2018",3,The new update is bad I don’t like the new update because it cuts off you’re body like you’re legs and arms. Also I don’t like how you have to go through each individuals dub instead of scrolling like before. Last I don like how you can’t just save to my dubs anymore and how you can write a text on the dub to put you’re instagram. Please fix these problems 🙏🏾🙏🏾
2029,The sims cheats app,"October 20, 2018",5,"It’s ok I like the app, it’s just I don’t like the update. You cant follow your friends you have to follow the people they give you. When u film or video the format it small and you can’t even see your self. I like the old Dubsmash. Try a better upgrade then that."
2030,Kylieeeeyo,"December 23, 2015",5,"DUBSMASH!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I LOVE Dubsmash!! Just 2 things, 1: Negative language (I ignore it though) 2: I LOVE the new stickers but you can only add 1!!!!!! CRAZY!!!! "
2031,Verdictlesslife,"January 2, 2016",5,"A dream come true! Okay, maybe the title is a little over dramatic. However this app is absolutely amazing and so much fun to use. Either make some on your own and send them to friends and family or get a group of people together and play out whole skits. I love it!"
2032,Haely Shae,"January 26, 2016",4,"One thing NEEDS to be added. I was listening to the options around younger kids in the house and some of the them have lots of bad words in them that I didn't know they were going to say. You should put a symbol by the play buttons to ""show"" if they have bad words. But in general this is a really fun app.🕶"
2033,Z.Ena,"March 4, 2016",1,Would love to give this any kind of review but I can't even sign into dubsmash with the current version!! Also why would we need an account to make short funny videos like what is the point?????? I have tried to do reset password a million times and it says that it is an invalid email/username or password which it isn't. I would've rather contacted the actual people in charge of the app but since I can't even get into the account this was my only other option!
2034,(Sprinter),"July 25, 2016",3,"Love this app. Until this update Alright. To start I want to say I love dubsmash. It is fun to do with friends. But after this new update, all of my dubs are messed up, won't play, and are mixed up. Also, when I try to make a new dub, there is no place to save them to my dubs. That button was removed. Please fix these issues!!!  My sister lost all of her dubs and can't get them back. Please fix!!!"
2035,MRHIC,"November 26, 2017",3,Amazing but needs to be a little better I love the app but there needs to better way to access all of you dubs(your moments). It takes to long to get to the certain dub you are looking for if it’s not in the beginning. Mabey you can make it so it’s like camera roll on you phone where you tap one thing and it shows  you all of you dubs(your moments).
2036,bbtkfjffb,"August 21, 2018",1,UPSET So basically I thought Dubsmash was a cool app where u get to make funny videos and stuff but then it UPDATED....when the new update happened I couldn’t find any of the videos I made then I thought o it’s probably lagging so I reseted my phone and I still couldn’t find it then I deleted the app and tried logging back in but all of a sudden my account apparently doesn’t exist anymore which makes no sense so I would like you guys to get my account back because this is just ridiculous
2037,Neakam3200,"September 15, 2018",3,Needs a update ASAP I’m a Instagram dancer and I use Dubsmash all the time sometimes it will crash but mostly everytime I try to save my videos to my phone some want save because “I don’t have my allow camera access on” but I do so I’ll turn it on and off but it still want work...I’m going to find another app to record my videos and when I do I’m trashing Dubsmash 😡
2038,Niyahboo123,"October 7, 2018",2,good until the update.. I realized with the new update the video quality seems a bit poor and the screen appears to be smaller. I used to have a specific area where I made most of my videos but now it only captures only a part of my body. Also “my dubs” has to come back. I already don’t have a lot of storage on my phone and having my dubsmashes save to my camera roll is not helping. I need my dubs backk!
2039,dæntÿ,"October 11, 2018",1,You guys totally messed dubsmash up for ppl One: Y’all made it so u can’t see your body
2040,See No Evol,"April 11, 2015",5,"Insta-FAMOUS! Lol! I feel like a star when I make these. I always wanted to make subs but didn't want to have to edit it on my computer. Wear headphones, dub/record, edit, upload. ""Ain't nobody got time for that!"" With this app it's hear it, press record, and boom done!! It's amazing. I've had a lot of fun with friends. Memories."
2041,Cowboysnake,"April 13, 2015",5,Great App This is a wonderful app. I suggest a feature that allows you to pay to remove the watermarks. Not only would the developers make more money but then also I could remove the watermark on the videos making it look more professional.
2042,BmanTheColtsFan,"April 15, 2015",3,"Hilarious but needs more time I love the app but I get frequently disappointed when of think of a great clip and it's too long.  At least 15 seconds should be available, but really 30.  I understand why it's short, I mean, people would want to sing a whole song or act out an entire TV show.  But really, we need about 30 seconds to get some really good quotes out there."
2043,Raitorelm,"April 30, 2015",5,Please add timer and touch record This app great!! But after consulting many of my friends this app needs three things that will make it the top app... 1. Timer 2.touch record and lastly 3. Don't compress the video quality sooo much.. It makes it look very low on my iPhone 4s
2044,Shelbydoggy,"June 19, 2015",4,"It's hilarious but... Like others, I have the iPhone 6 and while trying to create an account (I know it came out a while ago but I never got it), the app crashed on me. It's an awesome app and I've used it on my friends phone (NOT an iPhone 6) and it worked just fine. I want to be able to use it but I can't. Please fix it."
2045,Bongrat,"June 21, 2015",5,"Totally Hilarious!! We have had tons of fun making these videos and laughing riotously with our friends.  It's an adult app, so don't let the kids use on their own.  There are lots of fun ones the kids can do but you should do with them. Enjoy!! It's super fun, whoever created this is a genius!!"
2046,Swimmer912,"August 18, 2015",4,"NEED Delete Option I absolutely love Dubsmash,  but it needs to have a delete button to get rid of the bad videos we made. Each video takes up a little bit of storage and I want to be able to delete the unwanted dubs instead of having to delete my pics or messages."
2047,a meh costumer,"February 14, 2018",3,It’s okay I gave this app a 3 out of 5 because when I got it I thought yay maybe I’ll do all the latest challenges but instead everytime i go bad to the trending page it’s the same challenge and also another way to improve this app is by making a slow option so people’s videos can come out perfect and they won’t be out off breath
2048,Mattstar69,"May 30, 2018",1,"UPDATE PLEASE I miss this app. I’m not sure if it’s due too the iPhone updates being harder to program for or if the app creators overhauled Dubsmash attempting to try and make a social media platform or one that could compete with Facebook,Twitter or Instagram but the app is borderline trash now. It freezes & crashes constantly. You can’t save your Dubs and if you upload audio it doesn’t become available until you log out and log back in. Please take the app back to what it was. #SaveDubSmash"
2049,Itz_zoey,"October 14, 2018",4,Dubsmash I like that their section of favs and trending but I don’t like the way the vids are anymore I like the other Dubsmash from before better screen and long. Also u should add if one person want square and the other want the long one from better but the new update is 2.5 the other is 4.5
2050,Gggggggzzzzas,"May 4, 2015",4,"Most entertaining app I stopped watching the last season of sons of anarchy for this app. Hours upon hours of fun. I think it could use some revamping. It needs more organization. I don't want regular uploads that any person can upload mixed in with real quotes, songs, etc.  It would be cool, if videos could be just a tad longer too."
2051,Luvmimigray,"May 29, 2015",5,"My opinion of Dubsmash I was introduced to this APP a week ago and my son downloaded it to my phone yesterday and I have thoroughly been enjoying it especially with my sons 22 and 25 years old, they are getting a kick out of mom using it with them back and forth!!  Thanx for the fun!!!"
2052,robert Chuhan,"July 2, 2015",5,"Recording problem I am having problem recording. It Let's me pick a song and record but as I'm done dubbing it says ""Recording Problem something went wrong with your recording please try again"" please fix it."
2053,Calyn1,"July 15, 2015",4,"Great, but... Okay so, I've been a little obsessed with this app and all, and when a new update came out I immediately went to update it. When I got back to the app after it updated, the app had completely erased all of my data. I had no more Dubs in the 'My Dubs' area, and I had no more favorites. Ugh, so annoying😁"
2054,Sooner_TDub,"August 10, 2015",4,"finishing a video don't get me wrong I LOVE  dub smash but after you finish a video and press finish it brings you back to the home page. what if you want to make more, you have to go back and scroll all the way down. it would be very helpful if it went back to the spot you were already in."
2055,ecv456,"August 22, 2015",2,Update The update is very annoying and confusing. It is hard to scroll through my dubs without the wrong one playing and its just weird and annoying. Not being able to delete one of my dubs is ridiculous! It takes up unnecessary storage and is very frustrating. The update may look somewhat nicer but it waaaay less efficient. Overall the app was better before the update.
2056,Keren421,"August 23, 2015",4,"love it! some things need to be fixed, though it'd be awesome if you could be able to rotate your videos if you took them in landscape, delete videos, send the clips as snapchats, and maybe send clips directly to your friends' accounts so you can import them into your collection."
2057,Flygal13,"December 3, 2015",5,AWESOME This app is hilarious. After seeing celebrities use it I decided to download it. I started getting really into and so did my friends! The ones with two or more people are the best. I would definitely recommend giving it a try. Warning: It might be addictive!
2058,am88j,"May 27, 2016",5,Addicted I started using dubsmash for a while now and i get addicted!! It's a great way to compose small videos of your favorite quotes or songs! I also used with my friends and had such a great time! I say give it a try you never know what will happen next!
2059,Hugghfghcfhcghcfhcfhcfhcfg,"February 12, 2017",1,I GOT RID OF IT IN UNDER A MINUTE WITHIN PURCHAS I got the app cause my Friend told me to try it out and I made my account and all that(it was easy)then I went looking in my account settings to find that I can't have a privet account so random people can just watch me and I don't like that but before I deleted it I made one and it is basically a musically but with out the different filming things like slow and that and then I didn't post it and logged out of the app and then I deleted the app and wrote this review.😡
2060,Sublime_Life,"April 23, 2015",5,Love it but I've got a suggestion (: I'm totally in love with this app. I wish there was a count down option though. Like between 0-10 sec you can set manually in the settings. Would make it a little easier other then that I'm in love with this app!!!
2061,Andy Zaky,"May 23, 2015",5,Best App of the Year This is the first review I've ever written across the hundreds of Apps I've used and have been an iPhone user since the first day it came out.  This is one of the very best and entertaining apps I've ever used.  Zero complaints.  I would pay $20 for it no problem.
2062,Kdm8434,"August 21, 2015",3,"Wish there was a ""clean"" version for kids! My kids love this! They have fun sending videos to family and friends. Just wish that there was a way to edit the settings so that they could do it on their own. There is no way I would let them search by themselves there are WAY too many inappropriate things on here for them."
2063,Monkey-yay,"October 18, 2015",4,Amazing! (Except for a recent problem) Dubsmash is such an amazing fun idea! I love making them and showing my friends but unfortunately recently whenever I try send one to someone either from the app or my camera roll it says it can't. Please fix this🙏
2064,Lee Lee492,"December 1, 2015",4,"Too much fun! Except... I have had way too much fun with this app, it is great!"
2065,Lydiamaexoxo11,"June 6, 2016",4,"Very fun It's a really fun app, I like how you can just lip sink to whatever you want and act it out however you want, and I also like how you have your own account. But one thing I'm not a fan of is that they barely give you any time during the videos that you acting out. There about 7 seconds long:("
2066,Maddihall18@,"September 18, 2016",5,Addvice Hey dubsmash creator I think you should do an update so that when we make a dud we can choose to make it fast slow or normal like musically I have dubsmash instead of musically because I think dubsmash is better but please take my Addvice because it will make dubsmash better😀😀😀❤️❤️❤️🤓🤓🤓
2067,afiaaddico,"August 11, 2018",3,"🙈 the update changed it so it’s more difficult to download into the camera roll, but that’s not the problem. My videos have bad quality, my WiFi is fine and it doesn’t pause during the making, just when you go to my dubs, the video has a completely different quality than before. PLEASE CHANGE THIS PROBLEM"
2068,kinluyd,"October 10, 2018",1,Update is the worst Sorry but this update is awful how do u expect people to dance in a small square where u can only see half the body people are not happy with that the only thing that is good about it is that we can see the videos that we made easily before oh forget it we had to scroll all the way down just to see the videos. And now we can’t even see our whole body on the camera and it looks weird all together it’s very small
2069,Morgen Street 😚♥️!,"October 14, 2018",5,DOWNGRADE DUBSMASH PLZZ 🙏🏾 I’m sorry but I don’t like the new update can y’all change it back the new one can’t do filters and has a half screen and it’s ugly so like can y’all change it back plzzz or imma have to use TikTok and that app is lame and hard to use for me so plz downgrade it plz and thank you 😚♥️!
2070,Word whammer,"May 6, 2015",3,"Super fun....but Really fun! My husband and I have a great time playing around with the different sounds/sayings, but there is no way to lock out vulgarities. My kids, who are 3 & 5, often play little games on my phone. I am afraid they are going to open the app and discover things and words I don't want them to know. If I can't find a way to hide the app, then I will probably be removing it."
2071,Some Girl with an iPhone,"July 18, 2015",4,"Great Concept, Weird Glitch The app itself is fine: it's clever, creative, and hilarious. The only problem is that when I try to upload a sound of my own, it doesn't work. The app will indicate that I've chosen my ten seconds of audio, but it's just white noise when it uploads. Other than that, it's a lot of fun. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
2072,Powerpuff55,"August 15, 2015",5,"Please Read So I love the app, but I think it would be really cool if it was sort of like vine, where you could follow people and like their voice overs and lip syncing. My friends and I use this app all the time, and think it would be great if it was like a social media website."
2073,Mr.Blobertons,"December 10, 2015",5,😍Dubsmash😍 Dubsmash is my favorite app!!!! It is easy to use and well laid out. Any age could use it and there's so many great topics to choose from! I also love how you can save your own dubs to your camera roll and then later post them on said social media applications 🤓
2074,Miss Thang 123,"February 7, 2016",4,"Pretty good. Some issues. I really like using this app. It's fun to use with friends and family. But there's some issues. The app freezes a lot and it's a little concerning how they ask for your age and stuff. I just don't think they should ask you your age. Anyways, you can just lie about your age on there 😉."
2075,jokerJohnny@dubsmash,"May 3, 2016",4,New update needs help I truly loved this app. I've been having lots of fun making dubs I've made over a hundred dubs. But the new update is driving me crazy it's hard to work it needs lots of help I wish I could go back to how it was before. I really hope that they fix it or change it back.
2076,DimTillard,"May 18, 2016",3,Please Stop Updating Your App Let's turn back the clocks 1 year... the dubsmash app was smooth and easy to use. 
2077,Layy😜,"September 19, 2018",5,"Idk I luv dancing on dis app. But now dat I have a total of 50 vids, it’s not letting meh watch or save dem to mah phone. I recently did one and wen I saved it to mah phone it’s was black. And it don’t need to be updated. I guess Dubsmash has been slacking lately. It can’t be my internet bc I have unlimited data. Soooooo...😒😞"
2078,itsmedejahhhhhhh💕,"October 14, 2018",5,Best app This is the best app because I make all my dance videos on but I do not like the update there are not filters and the screen is small but without this new update there are filters and a bigger screen to see what I’m doing 😊 just a heads up😊
2079,K-kee1,"October 24, 2018",3,The problem The problem with the update on Dubsmash is that you can’t search up any other dub songs....we can only do the ones that they have then have to wait till the next day...We Instagram users like to post them but we can’t do the ones we want when they’ve been on Dubsmash .Please! We really want the old Dubsmash back
2080,TheDipstick,"January 20, 2015",5,Too fun Have had a blast with this app so far. Have spent hours with the family making some pretty funny videos. Not sure why it would be rated any less than 5 stars. It works great and some of the clips end up being hilarious.
2081,Megmo #13,"March 2, 2015",4,"Need to be able to upload videos from your camera roll The app itself is great but you should be able to upload videos from your camera roll instead of having to record yourself everytime, other than that the app in awesome"

2083,LEEZIZZLE (Levi Lopes),"May 31, 2015",5,"Improvise I honestly am in love with this app. But you should turn it into a social media base, like vine. We could have our own profile page where people can follow us and we can follow others and get likes from videos. That would be pretty cool. 👌🏼"
2084,Sunflower seed luly,"September 27, 2015",1,Not so good Every time I would try to get in with my email and password it wouldn't let me do it and then it would and every time I tried to make a video it would freeze then it would kick me out then it would start all over again it's horrible I tried everything there was to try but nothing well I don't know if it's just mine or it an official problem well I hope you read this so then you can fix this problem that's going on
2085,PeopleFun,"October 3, 2015",2,"Umm...... Okay, I am 11 years old. My mom told me I can't have dubsmash because there are so many inappropriate things. This stinks because it is really fun. I don't understand why you just can't disable inappropriate items on this app. It's not fair to kids who want to have fun, but are underage. I hope you decide to disable curse words on this app. Other than this issue, I think it's a great app. I hope you decide to change your mind😡"
2086,Gabriel€*¥,"October 25, 2015",5,"Dubsmash Awesome!!! Sooo much fun.. I love this app. I have never laughed this much and had so much fun in a long time.

2087,Itispartytimeyall22,"February 9, 2016",4,It keeps crashing In the beginning it was amazing. After 4 months of having it when I would try to save the video it would crash. I deleted the app and downloaded it again but it still keeps doing it. Needs another update
2088,I hate it!!! Ahhhhhhhh😡👿👺,"May 3, 2016",4,🙄🙄 I love the app but..you didn't fix the bugs and I got the update that says it fixes bugs and it doesn't and I'm dissapointed because if I make a good dubsmash it might like delete and go back to homescreen or something or if I make a dub in the middle of the dub it will say error and you need to fix that or Ima report you
2089,Very verry creative,"May 23, 2016",5,Update again plzz You guys should make it as if we delete the app then get it back the videos are still there cause it makes you not want to get it again if all your old videos delete

I love this app so much and it's so much fun, but I had to temporarily delete the app. When I logged back on, it had saved all of my favorite sounds, but not my dubs which really ticked off considering I spent a ton of time on them.

2093,Crazyreed,"June 22, 2015",5,SOCIAL NETWORKING APP Best app ever! Me and my friends make them all the time and they are awesome! But what if you built in the app a feed so it's like another social media app? That would be awesome! I know your team might not read this but if you do this would make dubsmash 10 times better! Thanks!!
2094,MEO_W3,"July 3, 2015",5,I am addicted! I love this app and I heard ppl talking about it and when I actually started using it I became addicted it what I do in my car when I'm waiting to go to work or pick someone up or even when u can't fall asleep at night. BEWARE of its ability to addict YOU TOO.😂
2095,Nvm3!!!,"July 19, 2015",5,More Time I love Dubsmash but there needs to be like a countdown so we can have enough time to start instead of having people start it for us. And on Instagram you see people's arm move from the camera. We just need more time like 3..2..1 or more.
2096,<3 sports,"August 18, 2015",4,"Dubsmash is my life But, okay I guess this is new or something but you click that unicorn button and it shows my saved dubsmashes, but the more I go down the more I can't watch them and save them to my camera roll.

2099,O9Sharkgirl,"October 31, 2018",3,"I DONT LIKE THE NEW UPDATE I’m sorry to say but this new about is not your best, the old one was so simple so easy and yet fun I used Dubsmash every day until now. When I first heard the new update I was excited but when I got to it I hated it and wanted to go back, I hope you can understand that this may lose a lot of people that have had Dubsmash for years and now don’t like it."
2100,dommjvw13,"May 29, 2015",4,"So much fun!! I love this app, it's fun to do when you're bored, just wastin' time, or just hanging  with friends! My only concern is that a lot of the dubs in the categories are overused, I'd love it if new dubs were automatically updated every week (e.g. ""Popular dubs this week""). Otherwise it's on it's way to being one of the greatest apps of all time!"
2101,Brykry,"May 30, 2015",2,It's fun but has major problems At first dubsmash was really fun but then its flaws started to unravel. Dubsmash takes 3 minutes to load before kicking you out so you have to go through all of it again. The worst part about it was that it deleted ALL of my dubs randomly. I had fond memories in my dubs and now I can't have them...I would advise you to save all your dubs on your camera roll or they will be gone forever.
2102,Alix1202,"June 5, 2015",4,It brilliant but the only thing is... It's like a really great app but the only thing is sometimes it says u don't have any storage but u have like all the storage in the world another thing is on some days the app doesn't let u save the dub even if u do press the finish button other then that this game is great
2103,Aech,"June 25, 2015",1,"Fun but glitchy I love sending people Dubsmashes and making them is even more fun. The problem is when I upload my own sounds and try to record, I get lots of errors. It tells me that I need to make sure I have an Internet connection even though I'm connected. It's really hard to make this work and there's no real way to tell if it will let me record over  uploaded sound or not. Until this is fixed, I'm going to have to keep the app at one star."
2104,"$:!28,762!;","June 28, 2015",4,"just one problem... I love this app except for one thing. When I add my own sounds, it uploads them and everything, but when I go to play it, no sound comes out. Then, it tells me that an error has occurred and that I have no internet connection. other than that, fabulous app!"
2105,Juliaz2951,"August 29, 2015",5,"The best! This is one of the best app I have ever used. It has everything that I could think of! It's not just songs, but also funny sayings and quotes.

2106,NerdyHipsterCat,"December 21, 2015",5,"Dubsmash This is an amazing app to do at a sleepover, when your upset or moody i guess... But you should try it! Sometimes it takes wifi but its free and your dubsmashes are private so for the parents that do not allow things to be public this is a good app"
2107,Mb98608,"September 3, 2016",1,"Stupid update ruined the app Was an awesome, fun app... Too bad you totally ruined it by changing the format! Such a stupid update, can't figure out how to find anything, can't scroll through my dubs without watching every single one, recorded dubs aren't labeled anymore so you can't find a specific one, can't re-record easily. Oh, and not to mention it deleted all but 29 of my dubs... I had over 200! Thanks for nothing... Completely gave up using it & deleted off my phone. 😒👎"
2108,Kitty kitty 2007,"December 30, 2017",5,I love Dubsmash but we need to make it better Just add more stickers to be able to be on there at once not just one and clicking up the loading for whenever you save a dub and to be able to add filters
2109,rainbowgang1,"December 31, 2017",2,New Update Honestly this app used to be my favorite app. Like to where I probably have over a thousand dubs. So when your new update made it to where you have to go through the old ones to get to the new ones. I’m probably sitting here for 20 mins just to get to the one I made 5 mins ago. I highly suggest you make a new update to change that. Really love Dubsmash but that update is just a huge downfall!
2110,Madisyndinello,"April 1, 2015",5,Dubsmash Additions ? I love this app so much but I hate how you have to press the button and then the video starts right away. maybe you could add a timer so that the video starts 3 or 5 seconds after you press it so you can get to a spot or something !
2111,LanaeKay,"April 29, 2015",4,Hours of entertainment This game is hilariously fun!!! My only beef is I wish you could delete ones you don't like. My kids LOVE to record themselves on this but I hate to just let the play because you never know what is appropriate. Please change it so we can edit what shows up on our feed!!
2112,reagan (the hippo)👍,"August 12, 2017",4,Just one more update please I love dubsmash! It's so much fun with the cool filters and awesome music! All I rlly want to improve is for my own moments and my friends moments to not freeze for a minute before playing! I loved the fix on community moments I just wanted it fixed for my moments and my friends. Love dubsmash! Keep up the good work.
2113,Chef StephCurry,"December 16, 2017",3,"Haven't tried it but hope it's good 😬 Now, I am not going to judge yet, as I haven't even tried it, I have but deleted it and got it after years which is now. Anyway, I hope there will be Adam Saleh's new songs as he is my idol and I sing it everyday. He has a whole new album such as Waynak, All you can handle, Tsunami, Feel good, The motto, and many more! Let's hope 🙏🏻"
2114,Kkkkalexislexylexi,"October 6, 2018",1,"Why y’all don’t 😫 I really do like Dubsmash but I can’t even use Dubsmash anymore because I don’t even know how to record anymore. That’s display when you open it is very ugly. I really did like the way it was before. Nothing about this new update is exciting. When y’all did this update, I bet some problem deleted the app. I know I won’t but it will just sit on my phone. Until the update is better, just expect people to not use it no more"
2115,fluffy cond😌,"October 14, 2018",1,THE UPDATE IS TERRIBLE WHAT EVEN IS THIS UPDATE BRUH. How do they expect us to record our videos in this tiny box. I honestly feel like dubsmash is trying to be like “tik tok” Because the have the “my dubs” set up exactly like tic tok. I was expecting to open up dubsmash and see the same things but now I’m confused. We can’t even use the filters anymore....disappointed. For the fellow people thinking about downloading it...download at your own risk. I hope you all acknowledge this and edit some things. ✌🏽
2116,PoloKing1190,"October 14, 2018",5,My Feelings About The Square Feature on The Videos You Create! This is horrible. I hate the new update on the square feature on our videos. Please change that back to the original(vertical way).
2117,Dubsmashaholic,"October 19, 2018",1,"Bring back the “Create Your Own Sound” feature! First off, I love Dubsmash...my entire Instagram page is nothing BUT Dubsmashes...but when I downloaded the new version and found that you can no longer create your own sounds...I WAS so disappointed! The sounds they have aren’t great and I loved being able to make my own! PLEASE bring back the create your own sound feature!!! If that feature comes back my 1 star review will change to a 5 INSTANTLY!!!"
2118,nayiahh,"November 2, 2018",5,Old Dubsmash I mean I liked the old Dubsmash better than this one because you can’t even change the color of the camera (filter) and it’s just something I don’t like and almost everybody I know wants the old Dubsmash back . 🤷🏽‍♀️🙄💯
2119,Hsjsddgjdnd,"December 2, 2018",3,"iPhone X users OK SO WHERE DO I START. Dub is amazing and I’ve used it for many years while I plan on using it more and more. The thing is, whenever I make a dub, it lags about two or three times in the video. It did not do that on my iPhone 7 but when I switched to the IPhone X Max. I think you guys should fix it where it will not lag on the X Max. Thank you for reading."
2120,Sha6299,"February 22, 2015",5,"Crashes I love this app but sometimes when I try to use it , it just closes the app out of no where and it will keep doing it then I will have to wait like 30 min for it to act normal again I will try to redoes load it"
2121,Scottdarottweiler,"April 17, 2015",4,"Totally Addictive For those type of people that use one liners from movies, TV shows and etc...on a daily basis then this is the app for you and now you can actually sound as if you were that actor or actress! My friends and family love it! Can't wait to see what they do down the pipeline for Dubsmash!"
2122,Jaechiang,"April 22, 2015",2,"Here are some ideas The layout of the app is not very appealing. This could be improved easily.  Also, give users an option to remove the horrendous water mark from the video. I would easily drop a few bucks to remove it. Last idea, give users the ability to record in segments similar to vines tap and hold recording method.  Otherwise this app is very fun, just needs some work!"
2123,HDM82,"August 23, 2015",2,"All fun and games until I couldn’t delete. This is such a fun app, but not being able to delete is really annoying. I was just trying it out for the firs time, created 2 dubs and sent them to my friend. I would like to delete them, but it appears as though I can’t, even though the support pages say to just swipe left. This should be fixed. For now, I won’t be creating any more dubs."
2124,Daniela🏀,"February 8, 2016",5,Interesting I really like dubsmash cause u can record with holding the button with friends and family it's like musically the only difference is you can see other people musically but in dubsmash u can't c anyone dubs u less ur making them ur self
2125,chichi6507,"October 17, 2016",5,Dubsmash This App Is Amazing && I Love It ... 😉💟😫‼️ but it's having problems when I record and it says please wait your dub is loading it takes forever I tried to delete & then download it back it don't work like it's annoying
2126,arii7765,"July 11, 2018",5,Awesome💍 This app is awesome because you can create different dubs and i love the quality of the music. So for whoever made the app I thank you because without this app I would be very stressed cause it releases most of my stress so I can have fun. ❗️❤️ thanks again for this app.
2127,Richard the Great 23,"July 26, 2018",3,"😬 It’s ok, but I wish that when you were searching for stuff there were categories such as comedy, songs, quotes etc that you can click on. I think that would make it a lot easier to browse through sounds if you don’t know exactly which sound you want to do yet, but do know what genre you want it to be."
2128,heywatuphey,"September 8, 2018",4,I can’t find the dubs I did I gave this app 1star because I just did some dubs and I can’t find then they don’t have a explore page so it’s easier to find people and when I go to my dubs my dubs aren’t there I’m so mad rn cuz I did like 5 dubs and there not there plzzzz fix it I wanna see my dubs so I can post them on ig😡😡😡🙄🙄🙄
2129,TT💛💗🤞🏾📱👑,"November 11, 2018",1,🥳tater tot😍 Excuse me but.. I wish I could give this app 0 stars. Why can’t you just get the old one back? It would be very helpful if you do.. you should’ve never changed the app anyway. You are like vigo video now! Vigo video used to be Flipagram and vigo video is worse. Your new update is bad too. I had to search up how to get the old update back and I did get the old one back. BTW you use the tutu app for the old update. Have a good day whoever is reading this and god bless you.
2130,sflwarped,"May 10, 2015",5,"Highly addictive! Whether you share them with others or not, once you do one you will make a dozen of them. One of the most fun apps out there right now. There is something here for everyone too. Old school stuff to dirty stuff. Love it!"
2131,Gordon_Siple,"June 28, 2015",4,Script I hope that in the next update you could add in a script to make it easier to remember our lines I bet you this will make a lot more people rate 5 stars and allow you to make more money. This is just a recommendation. But keep up the good work you've made a lot of people laugh
2132,Wolfpack 13000,"July 2, 2015",5,Really good app Really good app but should be able to put as many sounds as u want in one folder/album I can only but eight in each one I just think u should fix that and the bugle problem other wise it's an amazing app!!!!!!     😎😎😎😎😃😃😃😃.  I just love it
2133,Krkl,"July 7, 2015",3,"It was fun until.... I just got the app and it's really fun but, then this add came that would not go away saying that I should like them on Facebook. I tried to dismiss it but it wouldn't go away and then once I liked them on Facebook anyways it still wouldn't go away. I can't even access the app now because the add won't let me do anything."
2134,Kelsay1512,"December 2, 2015",5,"Awesome Super fun with friends/family even by yourself it's pretty fun. :(But watch out for some of the younger viewers, some of them have a bit of bad language) I would definitely recommend it ⚠️Warning may bring laughter to many: enjoy!"
2135,B-ROD 5,"January 2, 2016",5,Love the Dub! This is great if you are chillin at home or with friends. I don't recommend doing them in public because people will think your insane lol!! My husband thought I lost my mind when he caught me dubsmashin. When I showed him the replay he laughed hysterically. Super fun App! :)
2136,Cece34567,"April 25, 2016",1,Get it together This one day when I was trying to get on the app the screen where sign in or make an account so I signed in and then it took me to the sound board on the first page and when I tried to click on my profile the same sign up or sign in page popped up. So deleted the app to try over again and it did the exact same thing and it's extremely irritating because I want to see my dubs but it's not letting me!!!!
2137,Dub Masta,"June 24, 2016",4,"Dubsmash ROCKS! But... It glitches sometimes and it doesn't have enough memory on it. I need to delete dubs to make other ones, and sometimes it takes forever to load and record sounds. Otherwise it's a great game and i would recommend to anyone who likes to have fun!"
2138,marbet400,"September 4, 2016",4,Where are my dubs? Dubsmash disappeared from my phone and I when I reloaded it w the new version all of my Dubs were gone. Where are they?  Lots of fun over the past year with no ability to share it now.  Anyway to fix this?  Fun app but the fact that this happened is a drag.
2139,OnFLEEK1231,"October 13, 2016",4,Great!! Have some suggestions The app is great but i would add it so you could speed up ur vid and put filters on ur vids also you could just send to ur friends on messages instead of saving your vids on to the camera roll and then sending it to whoever. Yep dats it i love your app!! Hope you use my suggestions!! TYSM 💕
2140,Ny #42,"April 30, 2015",4,Needs one more thing The one more thing that it needs it that when you make a dub it should save to your account so that if you login on a different device you shouldn't have to lose all of the dubs that you made. Hope you take this into consideration!
2141,Dumb idiot man,"May 9, 2015",4,"One problem... This is a really awesome app, I love posting my sounds for others to dub. But lately, the recordings I post don't work. They won't play, and whenever I try to dub over it, it gives me a message saying it was ""Unable to perform this action. Please try again later."" Please fix this!!!!"

2144,cnv918,"January 20, 2018",3,"My Dubs? I am a long time fan of the app! I have a great time making dubs and enjoy most of the new updates. However, since the most precious update I am no longer able to save videos to my dubs and I’ve used the app much less for this reason. How can this be fixed so that I can continue to make and save to dubs to the app?"

WHAT IS THISSSS... make My moments a easier way to get through because there is some people who makes over 200 dubs okay !!
2146,Peyton😍,"October 6, 2018",1,update is horrible Please change this update back I’d rather have Dubsmash crashing on me than this I love dubsmash but I might delete it.🙄🙄the video quality comes out horrible and it’s not full screen no moments no nothing I’m so upset. I should have just left it alone I thought the update would stop the crashing but not all this. Even the other videos I made before I updated aren’t coming out full screen🤮😤!! Seriously fix it🤷🏻‍♀️👎🏻
2147,Sata567,"October 7, 2018",2,Might stop using this as much I’m going to stop using this app as much as I used too the screen shrunk I would like it but I have to move way way back just to get my whole body in the video and then I’m hard of hearing so if I move that far back I won’t hear. I did a dubsmash 3 times just so at least half my body could be in this square screen isn’t going to work out 💯.
2148,jadababy_11 🤤,"October 12, 2018",4,The size I like it all and everything but can u plzzz put true camera back in full screen mode because I usually do full body dances and it’s only can get half of it and the camera 😭😭😭😭💔 when u get a chance could u change it back to full screen thx 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

2152,Fforfatoomi,"August 10, 2015",4,AWESOME but one improvement super fun and entertaining :) only improvement would be to have the option to pause during the recording of a dubsmash to change the setting/character :( otherwise definitely would've given 5 stars

Nice way to express your emotions , I love it, but from few days my dub app is keep failing to share some of my fav dubs, it share the new one but not those specific ones, idk y?

2154,Dust128,"November 23, 2015",5,"So fun! My kids and I have a lot of fun together making dubs and sending them to friends. One caution- many of the dubs have inappropriate language so don't just hand the app to your kiddo. Otherwise, an incredibly fun way to waste an afternoon!"

2156,[arkym],"January 23, 2016",1,User Interface This was on of the great set apps in the App Store by far. It's a ton of fun and when you get better red you can take a break and come back to a whole new slew of sounds.

2159,Icee Queen,"June 23, 2016",4,Dubsmash It's a good app but if you guys make it easier to view ALL of your dubs would be great because when you have so many it's crashes so maybe you should just let us choose which one kinda the format of the iPhone camera roll! Other than that it's great
2160,Smexorrlent,"January 26, 2015",5,So much potential This app has so much potential.  It could really be the best app around.
2161,A CaliGurl❤️❤️,"April 7, 2015",5,So much fun! This app is so much fun but the only thing I would change is for the app to load faster after you recorded your dub to watch it and it should be it's own social media like vine or instagram. Other than that this app is amazing!!

Griffin,"June 12, 2015",4,"Addictive me and my family have had tons of fun with this app ,it is addictive, there's something for everyone, The app usually works pretty well in my experience, some of the dubs are a little bit off or don't have clean edges but overall we've had tons of fun with it. Great idea. and for free – hello ..."
2163,Dubsmash user,"June 21, 2015",2,Was good until.. I've had this app for awhile now and I opened it up the other day and it showed up the get started page that I already did when I made an account. Logging in again with the same information ALL of the dubsmash's that I've done were erased and everything. Irritating that I made all those videos to create one huge video and never even got to do it.

2165,Evanator4EVA,"August 21, 2015",2,"Where's the deletion!!!!??? You guys said to just swipe left and it will delete but no! It does not work, many people want to delete their dub smashes, but since that doesn't work, many people will start to delete their dubsmash app. So please update it into a version that has a deletion option and a private account option as well, cuz some people don't want their account to be on public!"
2166,Kbarnett5233,"September 21, 2015",4,Addictive!!!! Wish there was a way to separate languages.

That will save my stuff when you update the app . Like this didn't happen before when I first updated the app ."

There are extra steps to save your video, so I lost a couple of really good ones in figuring that out.

2178,D'Zired1,"October 14, 2018",1,Change it back I get it the app is cool and all to see and is overall pretty. But I can no longer see my body when I’m doing Dubsmashes and have to struggle for a good angle to fit my whole body in that tiny square. Besides that the app is great I just ask to change the options of how you want your screen. I also like to post my dubs on my Instagram story and have it full screen but Dubsmash has discontinued the full screen. Thank you. 😊💓

2180,Rolie25,"January 16, 2015",5,Easier way to upload sounds. There should be a way to just record sounds straight into the app. That would make this app bigger and better than the creators could ever imagine.

2184,Sueiejehjsksks,"July 21, 2015",2,"Great app but could use some tweaking I love dubsmash and its so fun to use but I really wish they would display the words on the screen as the audio plays! Also a 3-2-1 countdown delay when you start recording would be nice. It would be much more user friendly this way. A lot of the dubs are extra long with a lot of text, and although the sound waves are a nice touch they don't help much."
2185,34159poop,"August 2, 2015",5,"Keeps crashing. This app is amazing and hilarious fun for your family and friends,and there's nothing better than lip sinking funny comments. But this app keeps crashing and I reset my phone and THAT didn't work. I love this app pls fix."
2186,WeAllNeedGod,"October 23, 2015",5,Hilarious app to play around with. I've been playing with this app all day since my wife sent me a video first. I now have over 20 videos and of blasted all my friends with them they're all still laughing
2187,#some1,"October 28, 2015",5,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This is the best app ever although it has curse words it can easily be avoided. I recommend this app to ages 10+ children younger may repeat some of these words. But other than that it is so hilarious watching some of these videos!
2188,Gggggggjhhbfssg,"January 27, 2016",4,"Great This app is amazing it really is my only wish is that it's easier to find songs, like they should have a category for songs, vines, meme and such just to make it a bit easier to find stuff but other then that this app is wonderful"
2189,im.dreaa,"October 21, 2018",1,Whyyyyyy😤🤬‼️ I’ve had Dubsmash for years now no app was better until now. Why did you change the video size to square??? I’m really upset about this I don’t like it at all. If you wanted the video to be square you should have a setting on the video to where you can pick if you want it square or full screen. I literally hate this update and I can’t undo it.🙄 Now I don’t have an app to make my dance videos on. Thanks a lot (not really).
2190,Asdf2200990,"August 31, 2015",5,Amazing This game is perfect I cannot stop playing it I did have one problem with the Video I did the video froze but after a couple minutes later it was all better
2191,MindTrapMan,"October 27, 2015",3,"Love it but Bad Update This app is amazing! I love the concept of it! But the problem is the new update to it will not fully download on my phone, so bad that it deleted itself off of my phone and still won't work! I will try one more resort if this doesn't work and I'll post how it went. Otherwise, please fix this update!!!!"
2192,Markstronggggg,"December 21, 2015",5,Great for the family It's great! I love it and it makes for a good time with the family. We always send each other dubsmashes in text messages and have good laughs with each other even while im away at college!
2193,DDSTARGETRICH,"April 5, 2016",1,"I hate this app now Since I had to delete it for more data I remembered my login for a reason , and I logged back in and all my videos were  gone. Whats the point of having a log in and all the stuff is gone when u log back in?  This is stupid every thing else is there except for what I'm actually using  the app for😡😡😡. Y'all need to get the app straight because this is Fed up mess. By the way I do not mean that star ""I have to put""."
2194,Ajahinicole,"July 24, 2016",4,Dub smashes new update It was great until you added the new update and it's horrible. It's not good I made new dubs and now I can't find them they are not where the others are. I politely ask you can you please change it back.!.?!. I still love it ❤️ but not the new update😒😡
2195,it's morg,"December 23, 2016",3,"Some things need work. I love the app, but I don't like when you go to watch one of your old dubs & it either doesn't play or 2 videos play at the same time. I also wish y'all would fix the lagging video, I don't know if it's just mine, but mine lags & it's annoying. Please try to fix it or I'll delete the app. Thanks. 😊"
2196,Plumper!!!!!,"October 15, 2017",4,. i just have one suggestion.... i like to make these and send these to my friends but i don’t want them to be public and i’m not sure on how to save them to where only I can see it. i’m not sure if it’s an option or not but please make it be if it’s not!
2197,MDHPYA,"May 2, 2018",4,"So much fun! I really have a great time whenever I do a Dubsmash at a party & everyone loves it when I share them. The reason I don't give it five stars is because I don't know how to use it that well & think a tutorial on how to share, save edit & review the videos would be helpful."
2198,nigeria💕,"October 8, 2018",3,I don’t like the new update 😬 The new update is Ard but..... I don’t like my videos being square and now all my videos in “my dubs” are square and I can only see half of my body and I don’t like that . Even though I just updated it I’m really not gonna be using it no more because of that . So can y’all please change it back
2199,da_queen101,"October 15, 2018",5,I hate it I hate the app now I used to love it before the update bc I used to use it for dancing now you can’t even see your feet so what’s the point of it now I’m deleting the app 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄unless y’all put the old version back up
2200,Rhino Shark,"January 29, 2015",4,Great but.... I've had so much fun with this app but I've noticed after about 5 or so videos it tends to freeze after making a new video. Forcing me to stop the app and load it up again. Not a HUGE deal but still annoying. 
2201,chells07,"April 14, 2015",1,App quit working for me. So the first couple videos I did I was able to send or save like I wanted to. Well now after I make a video and I try to either send or save it to camera roll a screen pops up and tells me I have to like the Facebook page or I have the option of pressing Not Now. I have liked the page and even tried pressing Not Now but after every video I make the app gets stuck on this screen. Very frustrating.
2202,Rcerhs,"April 19, 2015",3,"Technical issues While I absolutely love this app, I am only giving it three stars because every time I try to save a dubsmash video the Facebook like button will appear and won't go away no matter how many times I press the not now button or even if I go through the process of liking it on Facebook."
2203,Niahuggy,"April 25, 2015",5,So much fun! My husband and I love this app. We don't get to spend much time together in the day due to conflicting schedules with class and work so sending silly videos to each other is always a nice to make the day go by faster.
2204,Riverdancer217,"May 25, 2015",5,Favorite app This is by far and away my favorite app lately. It has been such a great time passer. Completely hilarious and I love that you can upload your own sounds to it. My friends and I all have a blast with this thing.
2205,Dingoboy28,"May 30, 2015",5,"Really funny app Not much to say. Lots of fun. The only negative I've found is after 4 or so videos, it'll give an error but you just have to restart the app and it's fixed. Not a big enough bug to ruin it for me."
2206,shadowman520,"July 15, 2015",4,"Sound uploads will not open After uploading a sound using iTunes, I was not able to film a video using the sound. However, after using my only microphone, it worked perfectly fine. Please fix that issue ASAP"
2207,That one girl💙✖️,"August 7, 2015",5,Absolutely perfect!! This is probably the best app I have ever downloaded bc...it's so fun and it's easy..and with the app u can have alot  of fun with ur friends. And the videos are funny to watch when u get done dubbing💙 I recommend that u download this app and give it 5stars💎💙✖️
2208,Caroljqjqjjw,"August 18, 2015",5,Upload I tried to upload my own sound about 30 minutes ago and it's still loading. Does anybody else have this problem ?
2209,Bella564love,"August 26, 2015",5,Dubsmash is awesome I love dubsmash because you have fun and you can do so many awesome videos there are videos with bad words but so no bad words this app help me have fun and my family loved it and friends I hope other  people would like it to.$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$$
2210,Gaming dork,"May 5, 2016",1,Fix this! I really enjoyed Dubsmash but the recent update ruined EVERYTHING! 
2211,GiggityGuy007,"June 27, 2016",3,"Please fix the crash issue Everyone's been saying how whenever people go make a video and try to save it, the app just crashes. It's incredibly annoying, and there's no point in having the app in the first place if this keeps happening. Bottom line: fix this soon, or I'm deleting the app."
2212,Urja1234,"July 21, 2016",1,They are losing all of my dubs 😡!!! I had over 50 dubs and all of the sudden their not there which is unbelievable and now I can't get them back which is terrible because those are memories with friends and family and the whole reason for dubs is to have fun and make memories but what's the point of having this app if it can't save them ? Overall completely disappointed an unsatisfied with costumer service !!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡
2213,Ceeroll,"May 21, 2017",3,"UGGGGGG😡 This app only lets you have 75 dubs and when this update happened it deleted most of my dubs that were my FAV. And if you don't delete any and make them they won't go on until you delete other dubs. This is so stupid just let us have all of the ones we want. I deleted this app, but besides this not the worst."
2214,Myyy💜,"November 14, 2017",3,Can’t save my Dubsmashs to My Dubs Everything works perfectly sounds selections search everything now since I’ve updated it I make a dubsmash but it doesn’t show the option to save it to my Dubs. Sometimes I don’t like to post on my memories so I save it to my dub but it’s not there anymore can anyone plz tell me what’s going on?
2215,kxng.jayy,"November 30, 2017",4,I like the app but ... I enjoy the app the app keeps deleting my fav dubs. Then I have to try and find all the dubs I favorited and that takes forever then after that I favorite a lot of dubs it just delete them again and that’s frustrating. Pls tell me how to stop this or fix it
2216,Zariah05,"January 24, 2018",4,"Saving My Dubs Is A Problem Dubsmash is a good app , but I've been having problems saving my dubs to my phone. Every time it tells me to enable my photos on dubsmash, but it's already enable. I suggest adding the save button on the editing part of the video when you get to put your caption."
2217,Its Neicy,"June 15, 2018",5,Delete videos automatically I went on the app and my videos were not on there and this has really agitated me😡😡😡😡i been using this for 2 years and this isn’t the first time💯💯💯
2218,TW✨,"October 10, 2018",1,"The new update I personally like how clean the the new update looks but why did you shorten the recording screen. It no longer fits the whole body or phone screen. So now my videos cut either my face or the rest of myself off. And every time I make another dub, it upsets me and makes me dislike this app more and more. Other than that I like the new update just please but the recording screen back to its original size."
2219,NOTICE THIS‼️‼️,"October 14, 2018",1,NOTICE THIS‼️: The new update is cool and it shows a better sense of organization but the thing that I don’t like is that when u make a video u have to try to fit in that tiny square. Dubsmash should know that it is used a lot for dancing videos and it is really hard to try and dance and fit in that tiny square now. I would like if u could bring back the old way to record your videos. As far as everything else it is okay.
2220,Brose fish,"May 22, 2015",5,This App!!! We love this app. I have gotten many friends and family members just as addicted! My husband and I spend our evenings playing around with it when our children are in bed. It's keeps us very amused and entertained!!
2221,Ms JahGirl29,"May 25, 2015",5,My New Toy 😊 I've tried to download it once before but it wasn't working right so I deleted it. 😐 I am sooooooo awesomely glad that i decided to give it another try!!! 😍😍😍 I now have a battle: Netflix vs Dubsmash. Which will take up more of my free time. 😔
2222,Jdfjmfkenfjfnjfnf,"May 26, 2015",4,Just stop The app is great in all but I've had to delete the App several times because the screen keeps coming up saying to like it on Facebook and whenever I press no thank you it doesn't work and doesn't let me do anything else.
2223,Sum84,"May 30, 2015",3,"So fun! But too much vulgarity/profanity This idea is a hit for the whole family. Lots of quotes and songs from top Disney movies. However, I can't let my nephew scroll through and pick one as he would see in appropriate words/ phrases. Other than that adults and kids can have a blast with this app!! Wish there was a clean version!!"
2224,Taylorswiftrocksiloveher,"June 1, 2015",2,Fun but it's a piece of sh** EVERYTIME I go to save the freaking videos it says to enable access to my pictures WHEN IT IS ALREADY ENABLED so I go to my setting and pic and turn it off and back on and it doesn't work! Shut my iPad off and back on and It worked one time and it's back to saying the same thing! It's really ticking me off this app is a piece of crap and this bug NEEDS to be fixed SOON if I'm going to delete it!
2225,SilverDragon39,"August 3, 2015",4,Great App This app is good and easy to use. One caveat though. I would not recommend this for children to use because there are words in the samples that aren't exactly family friendly. But other than that... Get it. It will make your life more interesting!
2226,HIHI ViGGLES,"August 16, 2015",5,BOMB!!! This app is amazing it's so much fun to send these to friends and receive them back!! The options are limitless when doing a dub smash. Only problem is that you can't delete them from your profile.
2227,Jtjhammel,"February 5, 2016",5,So much fun! This is so much fun to use. There's so many different options and you can make a lot of hilarious videos. You can even do it with several people with enough practice! 5 stars in my book.
2228,MrsLightBulb,"March 13, 2016",5,Dubsmash is my everything I loveeeeeeEEE DUBSMASH! It's just amazing all of the things you can do with this app!!! You can create the most hilarious videos and vines and find practically anything. It's my go to app when I want to have a good time. Thank you Dubsmash!!!
2229,Fusisincnxlncnjdudj,"May 1, 2016",5,Not enough space I barely have anything on my device and when I tried to make a dub it said that I need to clear up some space and I would like for y'all to fix this🙄
2230,Nybrittan,"March 31, 2015",5,"Dubsmash This app is phenomenal, cool ,and easy to use. My husband and I make videos send them to each other or post them on our social media sites for fun. I have yet to encounter a problem while using this app I love being a dubsmash user"

2232,WestHills818,"April 17, 2015",5,Dubsmash Honestly just discovered this app the other day thought it was dumb because I didn't know really get the concept of the app but once I figure it out its the funniest most fun app I have on my phone I love it and suggest everyone get it!!!
2233,Jadehawk1,"May 15, 2015",4,"Kid appropriate vs inappropriate segregation would be nice. I like this app and making funny videos w the kiddos, but having a seemingly harmless clip, according to the name, turn into an uncomfortable 10 seconds of cursing and innuendo is no fun. Perhaps a parental control or at least a mark of Explicit (like on iTunes). Otherwise this is a great app, easy to use and fun!"
2234,Qwerty12457346,"May 3, 2016",4,"I liked it BEFORE What was dubsmash thinking with the new update?! I loved this app before the update, but now it's super hard to navigate and everything is just dumb. And there's no mute button on the videos anymore so it just plays over and over. And unicorns, really?!"
2235,Jaay 🦄🌴💙,"June 28, 2016",4,Great But... It is great the new update is cool but the bad thing is it doesn't save your dubsmashes anymore like it used to like if you log in on another device and I think it should have like fast and slow and regular and lapse mode it would make dubsmash so much better
2236,The queen of Miami,"August 8, 2016",2,"WHAT KIND OF UPDATE???! I happily kept my dubsmash app remain in my phone. It took some memory, yes. But it was worth it cause I had all the videos saved in the app, secured somehow. And I don't know who got the brilliant idea that in the update the app will erase ALL of my videos in the app. I don't have none left. Anger and disappointment is a statement. I want my videos back and I'm pretty sure so do other people. I'm so angry. – deleting dubsmash!!"
2237,Mayajo3,"November 19, 2016",4,Does anyone know this question So I think Dubsmash is great but I don't like the new update where you have to show all your dubs to your friends if you want to save them- therefore I think you should change it back to what is was before. I give it 4 stars.
2238,Betty❗️,"October 11, 2018",2,"i don’t like it as much anymore i missed the old dubsmash where we can go to the “ my dubs “ section. I also don’t like the fact that the format of the video is only in square form, a lot of people liked it better full screen. i would recommend putting those 2 features back on the app . many people are upset because of this."
2239,khmirah,"November 17, 2018",4,Volume problems It’s great but when I make a video when I’m finna post the video the sound isn’t there the column button just isn’t there so that makes it hard to know if my video is good or not and there is nothing wrong with my volume
2240,Elsamonkey,"July 4, 2015",3,Its ups and downs You can lip sink things that other people have made from different movies and stuff. And it's really fun but there are some downs. Some of the recordings have swear words in them or as the title. And I'm pretty sure that many people including me do not enjoy that. But if you stay away from those the app is much better👍🏻
2241,Cooliesummer,"August 13, 2015",5,Fix it I am a big dubsmash user but this new update has got to go i cant even record my dubsmashes because it wont let them play . Can you please go back to the original version . Thanks
2242,yukon_terry24,"August 21, 2015",2,What did you do???!!?! What happened to the delete option for your unwanted Dubs? This app might get better ratings if this feature was added back in when the next update arrives. 
2243,Djpalm5,"August 27, 2015",3,Could use language warnings My kids and I have had a lot of fun with this app. My only complaint is that when we're going through the dubsmashes some have unexpected bad language. I don't know if there's a way to separate kid friendly and adults but that would definitely get a 5 star rating from us!
2244,Chettahdude,"September 7, 2015",5,"Suggestion First of all, this is a great app. My friends love it when I make these, but I suggest having a pause button like in vine. I usually do dubsmashes by myself, and it would be awesome if you can pause your recording. Thanks!"
2245,Tb_13,"December 24, 2015",5,Dubsmash is the best app ever Dubsmash allows you to bring some the funniest quotes to life as your own. With the new update allowing you to type little messages across the screen makes sure you can clarify your dub.
2246,Crazy Maddie is Awesome14690,"January 5, 2016",5,"This is the best app ever created This app is so Awesome I have nothing else to say because there are not enough words in the whole world, even if I don't know about them yet I bet they still wouldn't be enough. Awesomeness, Mackenzie out."
2247,AlexNole,"March 11, 2016",2,"Great before the update Great app before the update, which now has taken away the feature of using your own music from your phones library. Either I'm missing something or the developers took away one of the best features for this app -- being able to add your own sounds for friends to use! Please add this feature back into the app!"
2248,vritterv,"April 1, 2016",5,Laughed and laughed! Really having fun with Dubsmash!   Can't remember when I laughed so hard.  Although I think everyone should have to submit their very first one when they just stared blankly at the screen while it records their blinking!!!
2249,BluBlu123,"April 25, 2016",2,Omg😤😤 whyy😫😫😫 Dubsmah is one of my favorite apps but it's really getting on my nervers today when I opened the app it singed me out I tryed to log in but when I did it would sign me straight out that is really getting Annoying. The other thing that bugged me is that dubsmah has deleted my videos one time also . If you won't a high star rate from me then you have to get that fixed right away 🙄🙄🙄😕😕😕
2250,Swift_Donkey,"January 31, 2015",4,"Adding sounds... Having difficulty adding sounds. Every time I attempted to add a sound, a message pops up saying ""An unexpected error occurred.

2251,Opinionatedwriter,"March 17, 2015",5,Great app one minor This app was purely amazing. It was great and I use it daily. Now me and all my friends have purchased this app. The best part is that it's FREE! This hilarious app is awesome. Maybe each category on the dubs could have an age recommendation because my friend clicked one that was😬 GREAT APP!👌👏👊
2252,TGIF 20,"March 24, 2015",5,DubSmash This app is the best app the could've made. I've always mimed words from movies and songs as if they were coming out of my mouth. My mom gets annoyed with me lol it's a none stop comedy and I love that new things get added constantly.
2253,Alischmel,"April 7, 2015",3,"WAS having fun.. I was having a great time making videos.. Then it asked me to like them on FB or press Not Now. At first I pressed the Not Now button and it wouldn't do anything, so I tried liking them on Facebook. Well neither one worked so now every time I make a video it won't let me continue saving it or sharing it. Such a bummer."
2254,Celo_saint,"April 10, 2015",4,Opinion Nice and easy to manage app. A few improvements would be a plus though. 
2255,Yukonsoup,"May 7, 2015",5,Medicine Truly a good time when using and watching others. I think it's awesome if you could read what is being while it's being said that would set it over the top. It rocks and love using it !!!!
2256,Ach1218,"May 9, 2015",4,So fun! I stayed up WAY too late making video after video! I love how you can press start/stop on your own timing and can remake the vid as many times as you want/need to get it exactly how you want it! I wish the movie quote clips were arranged by movie title though. Otherwise! Genius app!
2257,Dubcistic,"May 11, 2015",4,"Dubsmash I like this app a lot. My particular wish would be that there was a little more control, and organization of the library of sound bits. "

The app, HORRIBLE, free the old dubsmash. ‼️the guilty is trash, it’s hard to find a dub, they logged meh out and I didn’t even know my password, everytime yhu pause it, it start over, they have it already as a square, etc. the app is just trash 🗑!!! HOW TO Yhu UNUPDATE THIS!!! Cause before it even updated it was closing the app by itself while I’m in the process of using it, THATS WHAT YALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXING!!! 🤨. Let meh find another app that’s  better then this bull 💩 I will be deleting this. 🙃"
2259,blaahaaaaa,"October 15, 2018",1,"The new update Dubsmash was good before the update , and it was an app that i enjoyed but when i seen the new update i was disappointed about how you cannot do full screen , my videos look stupid with the tiny little square that doesn’t even show below my stomach . Also the quality is very horrible , and i can barely see myself . After this horrible update I’ve deleted the app and rated this app 1 star . DO BETTER !"
2260,johhnthomas,"May 29, 2015",5,Lovely bits of hilarity Before I had this app I was in a low place. Thanks to dubsmash I can smile again. There are so many was to giggle here. I have blossomed into the life of every party and I have to wittiest responses to text messages now. Finally I'm a beautiful butterfly!
2261,olivia_ojso,"June 27, 2015",3,"ughhhhh!!! I had this app and LOVED it, but then I had to delete to take pictures on vacation so I would have enough data until I could upload them to the computer. So now I'm trying to redownload it and it WON'T download it'll get to about half then go back to waiting. I really want this app but it won't download!! Help!"
2262,Jenna30235,"July 8, 2015",5,Yaaaas I'm really liking the whole captions with photo/video trend that's going on. There's another new app called Captionable that has the same sharing/captioning kind of feel. Definitely would recommend this!
2263,WanderlustSNW,"July 29, 2015",5,"Dubsmash is funny AF So yeah, easy to use and great soundbites preloaded or record your own. Great app that helps you makes hilarious, short videos. Only thing, I wish I could see other peoples vids on the app. Maybe set them up like the Vine format 😜"

It is awesome but with the new update you can't delete your old dubs please fix my sis keeps on getting on my (iPhone 6+) and making them and I can NOT delete them if there is a way please let me know ASAP because I do not want to delete the app and lose all of dubs!?
2265,SomedevilinME,"September 4, 2015",5,Love love love My best friend and I made 120 dubsmashes the first night and in the 29 years we've been best friends - we haven't laughed so much since we were 12!!! Soooooo much fun and all my friends that received them -laughed almost as much as we did!!!!
2266,Ejsutt,"September 21, 2015",4,Could use some change Being able to pause and restart during recording would be very useful. As well if it were made into a social media rather than just a recording tool.
2267,FunGal1691,"January 27, 2016",3,"Please bring it back to the previous version I dont understand this version because when you make a dub smash and you don't like it, you can't go back.

2268,Okay but not okay,"August 26, 2016",5,Lost All My Dubs I recorded a couple of dub smashes with my best friend and we wanted to go re watch them but i went to go look and they were ALL gone. It was an completely waste of my time. This new update is ridiculous 😒😡😡😡
2269,A Concerned User 🤷🏾‍♀️☹️,"October 7, 2018",1,"I want to rate this a ZERO! What the heck this update is trash. Take it back to the old Dubsmash, nobody wants an update. There is no point. DUBSMASH IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SOCIAL MEDIA APP! There were other purposes to it. Most of your users can from dancers. You took away the filters, and I don’t know how to use Dubsmash now! Your users are going down because of this dumb update. The highest to 0 is 1. If it was up to me you would have a zero. Change it back to the Dubsmash everyone knew!!"
2270,Thecouchunderyou,"March 14, 2015",5,Would be great Would give it 10 stars if we could use our existing videos and pictures from our camera roll .. Plz make it happen in update
2271,Ashton shad diffuses,"March 24, 2015",5,An idea I love the app but a cool thing you guys could add would be like a yik yak feature where you could
2272,Tiujquinn,"May 10, 2015",5,"This app is my life No really, it is. I'm obsessed with it and if you're someone who grew up quoting movies/tv/songs so much that it annoyed everyone around you, then this app will help you continue to do it in your adult years. Obsessed."
2273,Pajhina,"May 12, 2015",3,"Fun app I love this app and would give it 5 stars, but more than half the time when you create a video, preview it and see it's right, when you go to share it the audio is no longer lined up with your speech. Fix this and I'll adjust my rating. "
2274,Everyonestolemynickname!,"May 21, 2015",5,"DubSmash is the best! DubSmash is AWESOME! I've recommended it to my friends and they all LOVE it!!! It's definitely the best app I've ever downloaded.I only wish there was a bigger selection of more modern day movies and songs,but overall it's absolutely awesome!"
2275,The Chaos Monkey,"May 23, 2015",4,"Good times App works just like it says, although since clips are user submitted and named doing a search for something specific can prove frustrating. Regardless, this is about as much fun as one can have effortlessly annoying one's friends with endless video assaults."
2276,EKAKJD,"August 30, 2016",4,"Good enough? They should add a fast mode like on musically. I wish that they had it all the time. If they did, I bet more people would get app. Or a least some kind of other mode like a slow one. A fast mode would still be a lot better I bet."
2277,Lil najah,"April 5, 2018",2,"This App Is Trash now 🚮 Well What happened to making the dubsmash in a square boxed video instead of a portrait boxed video ? Why cant we have the option to change it. Can we have the save to ""my dubs"" option back, i dont want to just save it to my camera roll or put it in my moments."
2278,LilJazzy123,"October 9, 2018",1,unacceptable nah nah nah ik i and others have asked for a faster better app but ain nobody told you to do all this . Why is the box so small where you can see yourself like no now i gotta stand a whole mile away just to see my whole body. this ain cute and i nor does nobody else like it . look i’m glad it’s working faster but you should have just stopped at that & how df do i save stuff to my favorites😐 y’all really done messed up now
2279,Caleb_tumbles,"October 28, 2018",1,"The one thing! *(sigh)*,Ok The one thing that’s pisses me off about this app...Yiu can’t even watch other people dance,What’s the point of haveing an app that says you can dance but can’t view other people?!,That’s like saying boom  is online when really it’s just bots🙅🏾‍♂️‼️,I think y’all need to chill and go back cause this seems like a dam 4 year old app,No mean to be offensive but is it ok if you can add viewing other people dances you know make it litt,Rn it’s not good at all ⭐️😭‼️"
2280,PMS54,"July 3, 2015",5,"Having a Blast with this This is bringing me, my friends and animals a lot of entertainment. Only thing that would make it better is if you could use your own words. But all in all very fun!!"
2281,SHIANISMYNAME162728,"August 12, 2015",4,Love this update but.... I want to be able to delete the dubs in my app like I used to when it wasn't updated . 
2282,WallBronco,"August 13, 2015",5,Suggestion I thing you should show the lyrics or words the the chosen dubstep. So if the saying is new to a person they will be able to better impersonate. If upgraded I will be extremely happy.
2283,BesoSaní,"November 14, 2015",4,"Love Entertaining This takes a lot of ""the work"" out of creating something entertaining (in other words, it's super efficient)...I love it! "
2284,mllr_time,"November 24, 2015",5,Really enjoyable I'm new to making videos and but this is very simple and effective. It has a lot of variety in dubs to chose from. Over all I can't think of anything negative to say about the app. :)
2285,Frost269,"December 28, 2015",5,"Stop being so needy for approval!!! Great, love it, needs better sound samples, maybe a search filter to better find licensed samples for the videos. Yet I like it, my son loves it, my wife loves it. Tons of fun, easily shared with most social media. Great App, hands down."
2286,mandy_momo,"February 16, 2016",5,"Who doesn't enjoy Dubsmash?! :) I love this app!! It can put a smile on anyone's face and bring a lot of laughter to any situation. It's easy to use... To me, it's pretty perfect. :) I just need to figure out how to use everything then I'm good. I'm still am amateur. :)"
2287,Currylova30,"March 29, 2016",4,"Great, but needs a little bit more. This game is very great. There are a lot of funny dubs. The other cool thing is that you can create your own. The problem is that there isn't a lot of dubs. I think that they should add more dibs from newer movies. But all together I like this game a lot."
2288,KittyCatsRule890,"July 3, 2016",3,Will Not Let Me Delete Acc... I enjoyed this app for a long time but now I am trying to delete the account. I followed all the directions but the final button for deletion didn't work. It may just be a glitch but I would really just like to get rid of it. It's very annoying that it won't let me delete the account.
2289,Kay..💧❤️,"July 22, 2016",2,😤 I truly loved dubsmash!!💓💯 I made a lot of videos with this app!!😛🤘🏽 I was lit and every thing 😂😂💯 but until the last update it changed 😂💯😤😤 I went to go look at my dubs and they were all gone 😒 and I tried to log out and everything like the recent update said to do to try to fit the problem but it didn't work!!😪💯 and I really want all my dubs back plzz....
2290,Hammy buddy 13,"April 12, 2015",3,Needs improvement When me and my friends were playing it said that we need to make sure there was room to record ourselves that got me really upset I wanted to delete this app but if you don't change that I will delete it so please change it improve this app it fun but overall it is a good app
2291,Marteen44,"April 22, 2015",5,Totally Awesome app! This app was so much fun. Already made several videos and sent them to all my friends. They loved it so much that they downloaded it to and started sending some back within minutes. Soooooooooooo fun! :-)
2292,Dubsmashqueen,"May 30, 2015",4,"Love it...... However.... I absolutely love this app-- it lets me express myself and is a great icebreaker-- my only complaint is just like everyone else's... Id like to be able to save the videos to ""my dubs"" automatically, especially since I catch some of the best recordings drunk-- but forget to save em😂😂"
2293,UsualDosage,"June 1, 2015",1,"Junk I never leave reviews but this app is so hard to use and buggy I felt I had to. What a shame. A cool idea executed by utter idiots. Protip: maybe find real programmers to develop your apps instead of dilettantes? App is hard to use, hard to select a sound, won't allow horizontal usage, and evidently doesn't think I have an Internet connection. What a massive disappointment this app is. So much potential. Maybe next time pay real developers?"
2294,Dcj2001,"December 19, 2016",3,Saving my dubs I mean the app is a good app in general. It's something everyone loves to use but here's the problem . You can't really save . It gives you the option to save you video and then when u go and check your gallery it's not even there. Which defeats the whole purpose . Still needs work
2295,Queen Tabbi,"March 17, 2018",4,Cool but need more improvement I love this app but whenever I want to do my own sound it tells me to 3 tags but it never works plsssss help ME!!!! 
2296,MoeBunny,"August 29, 2018",1,No way to delete account Someone used my email address to sign up for an account. I found instructions in their terms of use to delete the account but the path they indicated to follow didn’t exist (on their website).  I downloaded the app to try that way and wasn’t able to find any way to delete the account there either. Don’t sign up unless you want to have an account forever.
2297,Korutinī,"October 7, 2018",4,"a small issue i love this app very much, however ever since the new update what been bothering me is when you start to record the video. You can tell it’s 9:9 which is fine but it’s better to have it 9:16. please change the record screen to 9:16."
2298,ganggang💕,"October 13, 2018",5,Trash I would like for the old Dubsmash to be back this update or horrible and the square camera is so ugly like you can’t even see my full body anymore it’s just horrible🤮🤦🏾‍♀️fix it nowwwwww!!!!
2299,GHYVDHUVZhuvdnjcjifbsobao,"November 20, 2018",1,Ummm 😐 very bad Soo like I used to have it and it was super fun. Now I’m older so I thought that now it updated it would be much better but I was wrong. Super inappropriate like I mean super. There’s soo much bad things that I couldn’t handle. Not good for young children. I don’t know why they even still have it on App Store. Please don’t download super inappropriate 😶.it makes you feel really uncomfortable 😣 and it gives you a strange feeling!!!do not download
2300,👋🏽👋🏽,"June 6, 2015",5,Love- but wishes I give it 5 stars I like the idea and all the sounds but I wish you could use old videos like videos from snap chat or just video but it's a smooth app and funny things. Great app for vine or Instagram.
2301,Dj_1247,"June 19, 2015",5,"Great but...... I love this app. All my friends laugh when I post stuff like this, but on time I got a pop up saying you can record then add the dub and I want to make a far away dub. So is there a timer or something plz add that"
2302,plsšßśšßś,"July 15, 2015",4,almost perfect When we record our dub-smashes it would be easier if we didn't have to memorize the words before we did the dub. Like you should put the words we're supposed to say at the top or bottom or somewhere. I'm not the best a memorization so yeah.
2303,Aubrey & Brittany,"August 1, 2015",5,Only app on my phone!!💘 The only problem is it takes up 3/4 of my storage o. My phone!!😭😭This app as one describing word and it's simply amazing. I know when I'm on this app I have fun and it makes me laugh. This is better tan instagram.
2304,Purple penguinz,"August 22, 2015",3,"Great app, but.... You can't delete dubs you don't want. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!! It takes up storage. Also, put something on each sound where is tells us there is explicit content or bad language. I hate going through them and hearing that garbage. If those things can be fixed, I will give this app a five star rating!"
2305,Michael nigro 16,"November 16, 2015",3,I AM OUTRAGED I am very angry with the app.  I got a new phone a few weeks ago and my apps transferred over to it but when I went on my Dubsmash app all of my Dubsmash is I had created we're gone!!!!! I was and still am very out raged and I thought they were safe on the App so I never save them but apparently they weren't please fix this issue!!!!!
2306,Crazy people 300,"January 1, 2016",5,Great but has some defaults When you get the app it is really fun but it does have some cuss words even when you least expect it to. But other than that it is a really fun and weird app. I loved it 🤗😜
2307,Babebii,"January 22, 2016",4,GREAT APP BUT COULD BE BETTER I love this app! It's funny to record videos using it but it would be better if we could share them in the app so other people could see it. I'm looking forward to see a new update that allows us to share directly in the app. Thank you!
2308,RaeRae084,"February 17, 2016",4,Please help I love this app!! But i need help with a problem the just occurred when I finished my dub it didn't give me the option to save or share it went right to my private and now it won't let me share!!! Please help me fix this thanks and have a great day.
2309,Majhaog,"July 26, 2016",2,Can I plz have my dubsmashes back I just want my dubsmashes back because when y'all had a new update again it deleted all my dubsmashes and I really do like the app and what I can do on it it is truly fun but getting dubsmashes deleted by y'all should not be happening to multiple people and all I'm asking for is for you guys is to give me my dubsmashes back please and thank you. ✌🏾️
2310,Love ittttt!!<3,"March 18, 2015",5,"Hours of fun This app literally makes me cry laughing! It's absolutely hilarious, and is the perfect for being board! There are so many options to choose from; truly something everyone can enjoy! I love it, absolutely amazing!"
2311,Horsez 2,"March 24, 2015",5,Great and fun to play I love this app because it fun and all free. My friends and I send our Dubs to each other and laugh for hours! We had so much fun with it we call ourselves the DUBBERS😂People may think we are crazy but it is certainly worth it!
2312,2BBlunt,"April 21, 2015",4,Yaaaaas This app allows you to be silly and creative.. I love it. Only sucky thing is that it doesn't load the video to save sometimes. & if you're a parent.. You should read the description about the usage for this app before downloading it for your child.
2313,Promprom,"May 10, 2015",4,"Needs refinements. I love this app! As others have stated before, there needs to be a better way to organize the sounds in order to weed out the bad quality sounds and keep the good quality/popular ones. Also a feed would be great!"
2314,Mtn524,"May 11, 2015",4,Love! Whenever I'm bored and am looking for a little fun I'll open up Dubsmash and make a few hilarious videos! I've never laughed so hard. I just wished that the recordings were better quality. Some of them end abruptly and it doesn't sound right.
2315,Maria_ Sebastian,"April 10, 2016",5,"Goofing If you like being funny by yourself or with a friend this is the app for you, I have a blast on this app I also like that my friends and family can send me their videos as well."
2316,Crazy4savvy,"April 12, 2016",2,"I love this app but bug needs to be fixed!! I used to love this app. However I can no longer upload my own sounds. I also don't have the same format and layout as the newest version of dubsmash. I updated my iPhone and the app and also tried deleting and reinstalling the app but that didn't help either! Very frustrating, please fix!!!"
2317,Angle girl323,"June 11, 2016",4,❤️💜😀💩💗😍🤑😄😎🐶 I love dubsmash but I think they copied snapchat and yeah and some times I think vine because it is so short and the bottom part of the app when u open it looks like Instagram so other wise it is a awesome app but I wish there was more songs on there 💜
2318,Triologykid🤪🔥,"November 3, 2017",4,"Very Big Bug😬🐜 When I log into my account My sounds are gone but when I search my sounds (I upload) It’s there and I have to favorite them and they’ll pop up in my sounds. But, I can’t Refresh My sounds. But still love this app."
2319,@realbambinofox,"October 7, 2018",2,"Screen too small , no record button I have an Iphone Se. On the new update , the screen is too small. there’s black borders around the top and bottom of the screen and when I go to make a video, I don’t have a record button because THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL AND CUT OFF. Can you fix this asap ??? I post my dancing videos on instagram and I use this app. My account depends on it."

2321,:) :( $$$$$$$$$$$$,"August 12, 2015",4,"The new update Ok, so it might just be my phone (though I don't think it is) but I absolutely HATE the new update. Don't get me wrong, I love the app, and I use it all the time but I cannot figure out the new update and I just like the old version MUCH MUCH MORE. sorry dubsmash, not your best work."
2322,McLovin age 15,"November 26, 2015",5,Can't stop making them! You like burning up time and making videos. I recommend this app for any user who likes making videos.I can't stop making.
2323,Sterling Williams,"December 1, 2015",5,LUV THIS APP!! Def an absolute Fav😀🎉👏🏻💥😎🌴 I would only say that there should really be a paid option where we could remove the logo and make longer versions #justasuggest and BIG Thnks for having no popup ads etc
2324,Deathlock85,"December 12, 2015",5,Problem with share feature Im unable to save my dubs into my personal photos or camera roll please fix this bug other then this small glitch dubsmash rocks
2325,FJ xfhkkffhgsd,"December 19, 2015",2,"Great app except for.... I absolutely adore dubsmash to the moon and back, but I have one problem. Every time I go to record a dubsmash the app crashes and takes me back to my home screen. Then I have to go all the way back to the recording and do the dubsmash again, very frustrating. So I can't record dubsmashes often. This keeps me from using the app for what it's meant for."
2326,Zebracornz,"January 22, 2016",4,"1 request I love this app and hope that everyone gets it. But I just really wish that you could see people's dubs because it gets boring look at my own dubs.

I love dubsmash, it's one of my favorite things to do, but recently my friend and i's dubsmashes have all disappeared and we want them back, since we did not save them all... Is there a glitch???

2328,Bekah Lynne,"March 10, 2016",4,"Would give 5 stars if.. I would give it 5 stars if they would make an update so that when, for whatever reason, you delete your app, if you re-log in, you can still have access to your old dubs."
2329,Boqyesha,"April 4, 2016",5,This app is getting on my nerves After the app is created it keeps freezing and also exiting me out the app after i make my video and it is always deleting my dubs fix this app please
2330,Mcoult101,"March 3, 2015",5,Awesome This is an awesome app the only thing I'm mad about is that I didn't think of it. My only issue is that people can upload their own recordings of themselves talking but other than that this app is awesome
2331,Bah H. Bug,"March 16, 2015",1,Update delete's all videos!!!!! Used to love this app - but the updates have ruined it. They have a 'my dubs' section and 'my sounds' section making it seem like all those videos are saved (isn't that the point in creating an account???). Yet whenever you update the app it deletes all prior videos unless you save to your camera roll as well!!! so ridiculous and an asinine business model. At least tell people for God's sakes!
2332,Elsoybean23,"April 24, 2015",5,The New Meme! So. Much. Fun! My only complaint is there's no filter or no way to at least know what's explicit before listening. That would make it more family/kid friendly :) whoever came up with this app is a genius!
2333,Coconutsmom,"April 25, 2015",5,Best app ever This app lets me send funny videos of me to my best friends and they can send some back it is just really fun but I guess it can get boring if you do it to much but besides that it's really good so just don't play it to much
2334,Greeneknight,"May 7, 2015",2,Great app but has a bad glitch. I've had this app for over three months and at first i didn't have problems. Then about three weeks ago I would open the app. It would open and go to the main scree and then just shut the app down. I'm only able to open the home screen for two seconds before it shuts itself down.
2335,ReeRee DubSmash Master,"May 13, 2015",4,I barely like the app I like it and I also don't like it because every time I try to say no to something it makes me tap yes instead and then when I do do it I come back it looks just like I left it and it's not very good it makes it look like the app is desperate

2337,queenglass,"December 2, 2016",4,"Almost Perfect! I love Dubsmash! So much fun to create little videos, especially with family and friends. I really, really wish the app had an adult filter for obscene and/or profanity laden clips. Cannot let my mother or 9 year old niece peruse the selections, and they want to look for clips too."
2338,SanaiLake,"November 1, 2017",4,"Good but Glitchy for the couple months i have used this app it has had some glitches. whenever i make a video when i'm done, my video glitches and I have to keep doing it over again"
2339,QueenStefff,"October 10, 2018",1,Not liking it :/ Um..... I’m not liking this new update it makes the video smaller and the quality doesn’t look good and you can do filters anymore which is devastating and can we just please have the old one back ? Please I mean downloading the video to your camera roll is easier in this new update but..... the quality of trash and I just don’t like it and other people don’t like it too. Thank you
2340,Nataile89,"July 17, 2015",5,Amazing app I'm 26 and I use this everyday! My friends and I use it to talk back and forth during the work day....when we are supposed to be working!!! I even got a few customers hooked on it. Super fun

2342,sophiebrenner,"January 10, 2016",4,Good but has its flaws I love dubsmash and think it is so fun but there is one thing!!! A lot of times after you finish a dubsmash and press next to save it the game crashes and it doesn't save and you have to do it all over again!!!! It is sooo frustrating!!!!😑🙄
2343,TapDancer04,"March 17, 2016",4,Good but.... I would like Dubsmash to create a Kids version of Dubsmash. Sometimes I'm scrolling through and see some interesting things...
2344,ciaraba,"April 10, 2016",3,Needs improvements I love this app and rather use this than any other lip sync app but it needs improvements. All of my old dubs freeze and I can't see them. I can only play the recent ones. Also the quality of them aren't as good as they should be. This needs an update fast !!
2345,Acwwillis,"June 5, 2016",4,Fix this ! I would be making dance videos. And they are a lot of work to master so after at least 10 tries I finally get it. Then guess what...YOUR APP CRASHES. It just resets itself and I have to get it perfect again. It's annoying! Very VERY annoying.
2346,Ms.Lovin it,"June 21, 2016",1,Horrible Dubsmash has all these features and everything. That's great but every and I mean EVERYTIME I create a video and press the button next it says processing your video or something like that and the app just closes. I looking online went through my settings and not a thing has changed. I'm very upset because before this update dubsmash was the app I used twenty for seven. Please fix this crash. ASAP. Please and Thankyou. -Robyn
2347,Emma Catcher,"July 17, 2016",5,Fun I'm able to send funny dubs to my friends and giggle and laugh. The only change I would want is to see others dubs that they made on their profile and they can see mine.
2348,p1nkguitargirl,"August 4, 2016",1,"Updates and ANGER I used to love this app until it automatically updated and DELETED MY HUNDRED DUBSMASHES! Of course, I never saved them all and most of them are gone! I had many with family throughout the year and now I cannot seem to recover any. Extremely disappointed. Do you want to know who doesn't love updates Dubsmash? Me. And all the hundreds of thousands (and more) of other users who have had this same problem. 😤😣"
2349,Wooly Pooh,"August 26, 2016",4,Why can't I see my dubs? It's ridiculous because I make dubs and everything and I just can't see them I try to look for a button but it's just not there please fix this because it's making me really mad right now.
2350,Jarvey704,"February 25, 2015",3,Needs A New Video Uploader Great app. I would consider implementing an internal video uploader for clearer sound and a more streamlined way to access new videos/sound. The external uploader is disconjointed and a bit cumbersome. I like the import functionally in the app InstaVeme where you can just copy and paste directly in the app...something like this would be great in Dubsmash
2351,L❤️ve to the top☝️,"March 7, 2015",5,Oh MY SPRINKELS This is awesome it's like magic right through my finger tips you just move your mouth and when the video's done it's a clown😂😂😂I could give you ten stars if it existed but sad thing is I could only give you one to six
2352,Nasha2714,"May 9, 2015",3,"Fun app but problems with adding sounds I enjoy this app a lot, it is fun and addicting but when I tried to add my own sounds I kept experiencing errors and they wouldn't upload. After a couple tries I got it to upload but then the sound won't play and another error message came up."
2353,Bladez614,"May 16, 2015",5,awesome This app is my new entertainment.  If you did change anything I would allow people to upload words to the audio that you could read like karaoke.
2354,New improvement,"July 4, 2015",5,Improvement On dubsmash  people should be able to add a video then put the sound on it the video could be from your personal camera roll
2355,Tinykoala,"July 7, 2015",5,"Love it! I absolutely love this app! One of my favorites, hands down. A really fun thing to do when you're with your friends just wanting to have a good time. Would defiantly recommend to everyone."

2357,Kelsey0717,"July 13, 2015",5,Best app ever!!! I'm obsessed with Dubsmash. Hilarious sounds to make videos out of! What more could you ask for??!!!? Honestly I would recommend for anybody to use if they're bored or trying to entertain themselves or someone else!!!

My only complaint is that when I watch my dub's, there is a dark shadow over almost half of the video.. Please fix! Thank you!"
2361,Untakennickname7896,"April 3, 2016",5,"Loads of fun I love this app and so do my kids. We've got friends hooked on it too and it's always fun to end a night out with some dubs. Or to welcome in the new year, or wish a friend happy birthday or just to throw it down."
2362,Hfksjcnjdj,"April 30, 2016",1,Worst update ever give me my stuff back I clicked on the app ready to dance then I see the new update they deleted 2 of my friends 1 of my dubs and all of my sounds I was mad and didn't know what to do I asked my friends and there stuff is deleted also and it crashes and freezes and there sounds are deleted also go back to the old dubsmash and give everyone their stuff back I hate the new update
2363,Lani🤘🏾,"May 26, 2016",5,More Old Videos? I like the update when we got some old videos. Can we get some more of the videos that were deleted because the app was deleted ?
2364,Bruh bruh🤔🤔 asapki dnjdb,"June 17, 2016",5,O my gawd This app use to be amazing until all of these updates came and swept you old dubs away and now you can't even watch your current dubs without the app closing you out besides that it's awesome sauce

2368,dodo_621,"October 6, 2018",3,"Don’t get the update! I like this app, but when you update the app, everything changes! You can’t pause it, and your profile is way different. I wish I could get rid of the update. And if you want to update it, add more things to edit your videos like magic and stuff!"
2369,L.E_..,"October 17, 2018",3,New update After the new update it won t let me make any more dubs and I am always making dubs so I tried to log out and log back in I also tried deleting the app but it still won’t let me make any dubs Dubsmash please release a new better update so I can make an update. But I still love Dubsmash
2370,Chilli_Flakes,"April 25, 2015",4,Crazy fun! But a self timer would make it perfect! This app is so much fun and addictive! But I can't get too creative doing it alone because there's no way to set a timer before the recording starts. I hope the developer can add this feature in soon!
2371,Justine vonasek,"April 30, 2015",4,"Can't get in! I got this app on my iPad and I doesn't let me go on it!! This app looks like lots of fun to do with your friends, but how do u do that when you can't get in the app at all! I hope that you will read this and make a couple of bug fixes!"

2374,Mario logo 48681,"July 6, 2015",5,BEST APP EVER but could use a fix I think that this app is a great alternative for making vines and parodies. Great for pranks or so on and so forth. Only thing is that I can only put 8 beats in a folder. They should not limit it's otherwise GREAT app.
2375,DanAstoriaNYC,"July 25, 2015",3,Has glitches! Cool app but sometimes when I'm recording the song gets stuck in a loop and the only way to stop it is to delete the app and download again. Sort of irritating.
2376,Wotzar,"August 17, 2015",4,GREAT APP But... The app is Excellent perfect amazing but the only problem is when i try to add a sound to my sound board it doesn't work i press it then it shows my soundboards section then it disappears in 1 sec so please i need support to fix this Problem/Bug
2377,Jenn.M.K9.Lover,"October 6, 2015",4,"Addictive and entertaining!!😄🎶 I don't normally get hooked onto apps but Dubsmash is fantastic! So entertaining and fun, lets me be goofy and make people laugh....which is a prime goal for me! Wish there was lyrics/words displayed on the screen when recording to make it easier. Great app for great times!! 😃"

And I done really like the update because of the video view wise but I love this app but I like the older version kinda better with viewing my private videos and I can save it like that
2380,Marcela Delgado,"February 6, 2015",4,"I love this app but.. I love this app but I think we should be able to record several videos instead of putting them all together in another video app. The app is perfect, just think It will be better with that feature."
2381,Sweetsuezq,"April 17, 2015",4,"Dubsmash Awesome app!  We (my family) have recorded over 75 so far!  It's so much fun and we laugh till we cry at each other.  Only complaint I have is I wish they would they show which ones have R-rated language!! Other than that, it's a hit with us!!"
2382,Sue_Madr3,"April 18, 2015",5,"My belly hurts from laughing! This app is SO much FUN! I think I've gained abs from how much I've laughed today! My husband did a hilarious ""Water boy"" dub that I just can't stop watching! He really likes the app too. I'd recommend it to everyone and anyone ;D"
2383,Cottoncandygirl137,"April 19, 2015",5,Awesome Because of this app I have been procrastinating on homework and tons of other work. It's hilarious and lots of fun. My friends and I love to play on this when we're bored. Normally I never write reviews but this app is too good
2384,Ava loves cheerleading,"April 20, 2015",5,Love it but... I love this app sooo much and it is incredibly funny and fun but it only allows me to watch a few of my videos and so I have to delete some of the videos that I saved but over all I thing it is a great game!!!
2385,trybond,"April 22, 2015",5,Fun app Love the app kids and I have so much fun with it. Only problem is the ones who submit recordings of themselves voice instead of the actual acting scene. Other then that I love the app and have so much fun with it.
2386,Hdjxjenkdox dhakskwhsvsjd,"August 24, 2018",1,"CAN’T RESET MY PASSWORD So I have recently re downloaded the app bc my phone was acting up, and it wouldn’t let me open the app. When I downloaded it I couldn’t seem to remember my password, so I tried to reset it.

Can y’all please fix this!?"
2387,KodaakNaii,"September 23, 2018",3,"Not the only one going through this :( I love Dubsmash, it was usually made for comedy... and I started with that but now I’m dancing with sounds from Dubsmash. But since summer 2017 Dubsmash just crash on random times. And my phone isn’t messed up because I have an iPhone 8. On my iPhone 8 I tap on my dubs, and it crashes."
2388,A former dubsmash user,"November 4, 2018",1,"Change dubsmash back I have used this app since the age of 10 years old and the app was fine the way it was. You could change the way the sound sounded, you could change the color of the camera and add a caption. You guys ruined the old dubsmash. I can barley do any of that anymore. You are losing tons of famous that use this app. No one likes the new update why not change  it back?"
2389,Queen🤪✨🌪,"November 7, 2018",1,"CHANGE BACK!!! So W/ this new update I can’t see my friends can’t add people and it’s just trash I can’t even change the filter, write a caption on the video , or put stickers on anymore.... I may still use it just for the sounds but ONLY for that I have to use a WHOLE different app (sc) just to put anything on there. Can someone tell me how to take this update off?! This is almost as bad as Musically or  “Tic Tok” and their ads!!"
2390,the figg,"October 15, 2015",4,"A smash-ing development Wow, what a wild adventure it has been. I have made friends and influenced people on this app. I have lived, laughed, and yes, loved. I have climbed every mountain and forded every stream. (Nice!) This app is amazing. However, the UI isn't all that great and it's hard to find a good quality soundbite. Four stars."
2391,Dub love,"December 7, 2015",5,"Dubmash I personally think that Dubsmash is awesome. I have already made more than 200 videos, and I just got the app 2 weeks ago. If you haven't gotten Dubsmash... GET IT! I think you would have as much fun as I do."

This is very upsetting, I've spent a lot of time on those dubs"
2396,Kas987flga,"November 24, 2017",2,Getting worse with each update The original Dubsmash version was by at the best and most efficient. Each update has brought on a slew of problems and bugs. This latest “update” doesn’t even load the sound preview.  If we can get back to the basics like the original DS version I think a lot of users will be happier.
2397,Boneless apple sauce🤘🏾🤘🏾,"December 24, 2017",1,Will not save and glitches This app is horrrible and it has been glitching and not letting me save the videos I have created. When you make your video your quality of your iPhone camera goes down abundantly and that is a HUGE problem for me and the glitches are very troublesome. If you are looking to install this app I want to instill in you that you do not want to waste your time and energy to.
2398,Arwa Le Dall,"January 6, 2018",3,Fix bugs Good app but
2399,Tarianna lol,"January 17, 2018",3,"Its good but..... I had Dubsmash for about a year and a half and i love this app but when i updated the app it logged me out , then when i logged back in it deleted all my old dubs and saved the new ones but when log in on a different device it has all my old dubs and deleted my new dubs"
2400,Flygurl_desha11111,"May 5, 2015",4,Love it!! I love dubsmash but I wish I didn't have to press the button myself. I also wish I could see other peoples dubs and they were more organized. This app is very fun but it needs a couple changes to make it a little better😍.
2401,Dweezy115,"May 8, 2015",5,Hilarious This app is great! Lots of good fun me my friends and family laugh all day from the hilarious videos that we make daily. Thank you for making it simplistic enough for even my nieces and nephew's whom enjoy using that.
2402,Isaacnbriar,"June 4, 2015",4,"Fun app! It's a fun app. The only thing is that somehow, we should be able to filter through the dubs that aren't that great. If I'm looking for a ""Wedding Crashers"" quote, I don't want to hear every dick and Jane's version of it. I want something clean and the original. Other than that, it's a fun app."
2403,Lobotopotmus,"June 9, 2015",4,"Very fun! Love this app! Very addicting, I can keep busy for hours with it!"
2404,The AppStore,"July 5, 2015",5,FUN😀😎😎😎😜😜😜 This is one of the best apps I have!it is awesome that they give u so many choices but the one downfall is that some of the dubs have cussing words in the dub or the title and people who are 10 or older other than that I give it an A++++++👍👍👌👌👌👌
2405,❓Anonymous❔,"July 17, 2015",4,Amazing! Huge list of categories and sounds. It's fun to use when your bored or need something to quickly post on social media. There are a few bugs but they will probably work those out!
2406,Maya nov 20,"July 18, 2015",4,Really great app but.... Idk if this is only me but I recorded a voice thing on the app and decided I didn't want to post it but even on the home screen the voice kept repeating over and over. Otherwise before this happened the app was super fun and great!
2407,Kayla7704,"August 7, 2015",5,Amazing🙊 I think it is great for when your bored but the thing is you need wifi. It's fun when your with your friends but you have to have wifi/data plan🙈
2408,DiddlyDoo257,"August 16, 2015",5,DubSmash I love DubSmash SO much!! I've been doing it with my friends and family. We don't usually do the videos to make them good. We make them to entertain. The best part is that it's free and there is no ads. Thank you creators of DubSmash! ❤️
2409,Cutey Me 1,"August 16, 2015",3,I like the update but there is a problem I like the update but you can't delete. I need a delete button their are certain ones I don't want. Please fix the no delete button issue! If you had a delete button I maybe would have gave it a 4 or 5 star.
2410,noscoper420,"February 15, 2015",2,Be careful I connected this app to my Facebook and once I was done making the video I saved it to my camera roll and posted it on fb. 
2411,Random13chaos,"March 27, 2015",5,"So fun This app is easy to use and super fun! I have had no issues so far and have made at least a couple dozen videos. Pick a clip, look into the camera and done. Couldn't be easier."

I absolutely love this app. It's so fun to use, but I just wish all the dubsmashes that you make will be saved to your account, even if the app gets deleted!!!

2415,Biggest Fannie,"April 29, 2015",5,I love this I love this app. My cousin showed it to me but first I thought it was dumb but when I started making videos of my baby brother omg I felt in love with it😍. If I had the power I would have gave the owner of this app the best award in the world😏😏😇😇
2416,caitymack2467,"July 11, 2018",1,"Update I really don’t like the sharing to my moments. The more you save videos there, the more it’s harder to get to your new ones because your old ones are still there. I miss saving to my dubs, I really don’t like the update! I want to be able to chose a video I want to see without having to click through every single video made to get to one. I want all my dubs in one place...in my dubs."
2417,decemberbaby_29-,"October 15, 2018",2,It needs improvement The new update is cool but we need to be able to see other people Dub-smashes and the size the screen is for dancers can throw you off and it is aggravating because you don’t know if you are in or out of the video so if you update again can you go back to some of the old things. Please
2418,CurtisMoshay,"October 17, 2018",3,Suggestions for new version 🗣✨✨ I like the new update but i dont like how the video camera view is snaller than the old version of the app..I think if you can to have a access for the app users to select what kind of video view they would prefer..for their recording

2422,Anonymous😊😀😃,"December 27, 2015",5,Awesome If your thinking about getting this app totally do get it it's so much fun to do when your bored and is just fun in general there is swearing which is the only bad thing but other wise this app is fab 🤗
2423,A confused mf😐,"January 2, 2016",3,"😐 The app is good but what's the point of making an account for it if when you log out or delete the app and redownload it, the dubsmashes you made are gone ?😐 That makes no since there might as well not be account for it if your previous dubs aren't saved 😐."
2424,Jshdhdhd I,"February 10, 2016",3,"Lag I really enjoy this app and I thought the pause feature was a great idea, however, whenever I make a dub, the words don't match up with my mouth. At first I thought it was just me, but it happens every single time. I would definitely rate 5 stars if not for this problem."
2425,😎😃😎😃😱,"June 21, 2016",5,Amazing I really love dubsmash. It's super fun sending them to all my friends. I do have a suggestion. Dubsmash should have streaks with people like snapchat does. And maybe even similar filters such as the dog or flower crown ect.. ❤️
2426,Queenlisalee,"June 25, 2016",5,I💖this app When im bored i go straight to this app and dance my but off😂😂😂.
2427,Skeet5449,"July 26, 2016",4,Good! The app is fun and easy to find everything. I like how you can send a dub to the people you follow. You can write on your dub. There is a lot of dubs with curse words and I wish there was more dubs that were more appropriate for kids but overall it is a very fun app.
2428,DrawmeYup,"October 6, 2016",2,"Needs filters and debugged. Be cool if you could add filters to it and in different parts of dubbing when you record to make it more dramatic. Also, it crashes. And, you could add the part back where you could upload a video that you already created, that bit the big one when you took it away."
2429,Kay buzz,"February 25, 2018",3,"BRING BACK MY DUBS💯 I felt like a total idiot when i downloaded dubsmash, did one, and had no idea how to save it to “My Dubs”. When i went on my profile “My Dubs” was there but i couldn’t upload anything to it. i don’t want to upload every dub to “My Moments”, or to my camera roll because it takes up space. BRING. MY. DUBS. BACK!!!!!!."
2430,Mr. Harrison,"April 10, 2015",5,So much fun... Love this app. My friends and I are having a blast sending each other videos. Just wish there were more clips. Downloading my own was easy though. Great job!
2431,BaileyMarb,"April 14, 2015",5,"Entertaining as HE!! My sister and I send videos back in forth all day! I love it so much. I think for the next update, they should colab with Snapchat so we can send these videos through the app!!!"
2432,Skymini050703020804,"May 17, 2015",5,So dope!! I absolutely love this app. But something that would make it ten times better would be a timer option so u don't have to go right into the video you can get in place..
2433,Vicky Ieshia,"May 18, 2015",5,So much fun!😀 I love this app. Heard about it for a while but just started using it today. It's very fun. You can spend hours on it. The only thing I wish is that videos were longer.
2434,beckshire,"June 6, 2015",5,Awesome!! This will get kids out of a bad mood too!! Absolutely the best app for entertainment!  Stayed up all night sending them back and forth with my girls! Then first thing this morning!!  Shhhhhh. This is the first time I've rated an app!
2435,Fkudsbjyvv,"June 22, 2015",1,I love it until.. One day I got on the app and it would keep taking me back to my home screen and then I deleted it and downloaded it again and it erased my acc idkw so I tryed make thing another on and when I get to the birth part I would click next and it would go back to my home screen so... I deleted it again and downloaded it 5min after I deleted it and it's still doing the same thing ughhh
2436,m91.sanchez,"July 4, 2015",4,"Good, but has potential Awesome idea, but they need to add editing features to make it more flexible. Has lots of potential if they develop it more! Would be cool if you could add it to other videos that have already been recorded, cut up sound bites, etc."

2453,Jt4278,"July 10, 2015",3,"Needs a filter This is a great idea-super fun for kids and parents. HOWEVER, without a filter to block out inappropriate material, this is NOT a good app for kids. Needs to be more like 16 instead of 13. Anyone can upload themselves saying anything, and it would seem they do. Too bad, bc otherwise a fun app. Deleting now. 😟"
2454,ShayK316,"August 9, 2015",3,"⭐️⭐️⭐️ Awesome app! One thing I would add is a timing option so you can do certain dubsmash videos. Another thing is the error message that I don't have enough space to do the dubsmash, when I actually do have the space! Please fix, I don't want to have to delete the app because of this!"
2455,FFDP2014,"October 17, 2015",5,I have NOTHING!! Update Before updating to ios 9 all the categories has something in the sounds boards!! Now there is NOTHING!! UPDATE: The issue has been fixed and the app is fun again!!
2456,Curlin Jason,"November 22, 2015",5,"Totally addictive Extremely fun. Wish the sound clips could be slightly longer, but am having a blast. Can't argue with free and something that works flawlessly."

2458,Ahj05,"March 31, 2016",4,Needs a speed button Dubsmash is an awesome app... But it needs a speed button to help people with dubsmashes! It needs a button to press that makes your video look faster than it is!! 
2459,Jamya Hoskins,"May 3, 2016",1,Making me mad😡😤 I had dubsmash for a month and now it wants to exit out every time I go in I need some one to fix it because I love dubsmash but it's not on it's A-game this week so I deleted it once and I downloaded it back and it still doesn't work so I deleted until I get an email that it's working now so if I don't get an email I won't download it back sorry for the misunderstanding but I need it fixed ASAP😤
2460,Hunnty,"April 2, 2015",4,It's Aright It's really fun to use and has a lot of choices to choose from and it's just fun. But when it asks me to like them on Facebook it won't let me press not now and it stays there even after I like it. Please fix it won't let me continue
2461,G-lat,"April 14, 2015",5,"What a great app!!! This app is amazing! It's so much fun, and there are so many sounds you can use. My favorite is when I search for something specific. It's a lot of fun to share with your friends too.(:"

2464,Lien9210,"April 30, 2015",5,Funny app It's hard something to match your voice sometimes but other thank that it's funny to send to your friends and family.
2465,Kandi215,"May 7, 2015",5,"Addictive Fun I have been stuck in my bedroom on non-weight baring, bored to tears for 3 months until my favorite cousin introduced this app to me. I have been recording and receiving dubs and now in happy tears. We can't get enough!"
2466,amuncory,"May 10, 2015",3,"Fun- but filter out foul language My family has loved playing with this. We have had some hilarious moments. However my children have stumbled upon some pretty offensive language. I would give this more stars if there was a family version, or a way to filter out the foul language."
2467,Buffalo12345,"May 11, 2015",4,Longer videos Hey I luv this app but I really wish they had more time on videos because u only get like 10 seconds and I really would appreciate if u add some more seconds in the videos I would really really appreciate it please thx
2468,Alvacaster,"May 14, 2015",5,"Hilarious! If you have an addiction to movie quotes, you'll have an addiction to this app. It doesn't even matter if your friends think you're funny, as long as YOU think you're funny!"
2469,Annie13:),"May 21, 2015",5,So much funny! We have never laughed so hard in our lives. This is fun for the whole family. A great app for all ages. Though some of the nasty phrases l/songs should have a warning if you are 14 or less.
2470,ALV0902,"February 1, 2015",5,Great Potential Great app. Hopefully in the future you will be able to use videos already recorded and on your device instead of filming within the app.
2471,Farhat~,"March 16, 2016",5,"Im Lovin' It❤️ Just love it. But please fix the crashes, when i updated the recent version it worked perfectly but now why is it crashing i don't get it!"
2472,JoJohuey,"May 4, 2016",3,"Frustrating This app is good but frustrating, you have an account but if you delete the app and redownload it then all of the dubs are gone. So that's very dumb. If we have an account we should be able to have them all stored back in our account. This is stupid."
2473,smitty2356,"May 8, 2016",4,Good so far! I've heard bad things about this app. Like I've heard that after like a month or so people find bugs in the app. I've had it for a few days (less than a week) and it is working perfectly for me! Good app!
2474,Kiki29205,"July 1, 2016",1,Terrible😐😐 I loved Dubsmash it was my all time favorite app I made dance. Videos which is how I famous for making dubs on Instagram but now everyone i make a video an press next it loads an then crashes (app closes) I've deleted it an downloaded back that didn't work I restarted my phone that didn't work I made a new account that also didn't work so this needs to be fixed immediately
2475,that.curlykid,"February 19, 2018",2,"It’s ok Dubsmash is my FAVORITE app🤪but idk what’s been happening to it recently . It’s not loading any of the most recently popular beats and sounds . It just stays on the same page . And when u refresh it , it stills doesn’t work . Y’all really need to work on that . But other than that issue it’s a really good app for dancers and other people who like to use audios ❤️"
2476,......tay,"October 9, 2018",3,"new update total trash the app was great before the recent update. now when u make a dubsmash u can only make a video with half of your body, no more full bodies. And also it just made things more complicated, creators if u are reading this change it back"
2477,muffin.i,"October 16, 2018",1,"The new update. Respectfully, the most recent update that was just thrown out to us is awful, i’d prefer the dubsmash I had last week. Its confusing, its every where && I wouldn’t like to receive notifications about shows on TV. My favorites have changed, and we also can no longer change the size of the dubsmash we do. Long story short, its not appealing and I don’t like it."
2478,kwasi5179,"December 23, 2018",2,"Difficult to navigate, very buggy The navigation layout is pretty weird. It's also buggy as I cannot seem to save a specific dub to my camera roll, instead, it's select the next video in my dubs to save to my camera roll... otherwise, this app is pretty fun to use, just needs a lot of improvements"
2479,Kenzi06,"February 1, 2019",5,Can the update be capatible with iPads I want t have update but my iPad  doesn't support it and I was wondering if that could be fixed because I really want the new Dubsmash update.
2480,Graa2,"July 20, 2015",4,"Really Cool App But..... I really like this app! It has everything, and its easy to make videos but, when you take the video we should be able to pause it like vine because with that you can change character and stuff😜😝 PLEASE DO IT PLEASE!!!"
2481,MayEllaLouise,"August 6, 2015",4,"Pretty cool I love this app and it makes me laugh, but recently I haven't been able to add songs to my song boards. I click on the thing that says add to soundboard, but then nothing happens. It's a bummer, and needs to be fixed soon!"
2482,Cjules1994,"August 21, 2015",5,Rating cuz u won't stop asking This is a hillarious app! I've shared it with my friends and it's fun sending each other dubs back and forth! Definitely get the app off you love having a good laugh!
2483,Linawrites,"September 21, 2015",4,Love it BUT This is such a fun app. A lot of sexual postings though it makes it difficult to choose good humor videos. Since the update it's slower and not everything loads for each category. However it is so fun and great for group entertainment.
2484,Lil' bit awesome (Lily),"October 15, 2015",5,Great App! Read me... This app is so awesome I really like all the recordings but if you are little I wouldn't recommend this because some of them have bad words but other than that I love this app!!! 💞
2485,Chubbybunnyluv,"December 3, 2015",4,"TIMER NEEDED, awesome app tho I love dubsmash, but when I make videos, I always get either my arm in the way, my phone falls over, or I'm late for the whole thing 😕, A timer would definitely make life easier other than that, they are a lot of fun 😜, PLEASE ADD A TIMER IN THE NEXT UPDATE 🔥💘😌 thank you ☺️"
2486,Jax Raven,"January 5, 2016",5,Most hilarious thing ever I love this app more than words can express.  It is the funniest thing I think I have ever played with and I always use it to cheer my friends or even myself up.

2490,KimberlySalter,"February 17, 2015",1,"Great idea but profane and super inappropriate I would recommend this to others if there weren't such prevalent profanity, some you can obviously tell will be profane or inappropriate, but some you just don't know until you play the sounds. "
2491,kelbasvb,"February 27, 2015",1,"it does not work! H A T E D!!! First of all you cant just sing up with your facebook account like normal apps do. Second, Nothing seems to work appropriately, i tried to extract an audio from a video and i just couldnt, it would not work, the screen just froze and it took me to the start everytime, when i finally did it with a song from my itunes, the part i chose was not the final part, for the final video.

2494,schulte11,"April 24, 2015",5,"Awesome It's so much fun. I love it! And I know we can add text or our own emojis, but y'all should make it so we can make the emojis or text big and move them around, like how snapchat has it. Otherwise, love it!!"
2495,Luk-e-san,"April 27, 2015",5,Also much fun!!! I never write reviews. Matter of fact this is my first written  review of an app. But this app is so good I had to write a review. It is so much fun!!!! The creativity and fun you can have with these videos are endless.
2496,Ms. Poopy pants,"May 9, 2015",5,"Amaz This is the most fun app I have ever got.  I love it and it keeps me busy.  I suggest that everyone should get it, no excuses.  Also, there is every saying you could imagine on it.  In my opinion my favorite is called ""beer in a coconut""😉"
2497,Bashash08,"May 10, 2015",5,Perfect for the Movie Quoter My family communicates through movie quotes so this app has made that so much more fun! I love the fact that I can send them through text message to my dad and sister!

2502,Myles Hoglund,"June 16, 2016",2,"Please fix this please. The reason I gave this a 2 star rating is because. I recorded a dub and I accidentally pressed the wrong button(the profile dub button) and I don't understand how/why u can't take the profile dub and share it on other apps,also I don't understand why there's a profile dub in the first place. It really stresses me out."

So...I think this used to be different actually Bc like it was a picture picture it was like before but ima see if I can watch my old videos on this Bc I remember doing a lot of video when I was younger and if can’t watch em then that’s pretty sad for me.
2506,awesomesauce💞,"September 29, 2018",5,Update? I think that y’all should have a update to where you can move stuff from “My Moments” to “ My Dubs” just in case you didn’t save it to my dubs originally
2507,JJ103783,"October 8, 2018",5,Hate the update The update is trash! The version before this update is better Dubsmash founders please to do better because this is not right. The app is amazing but the update is not !

2516,Muse bug,"November 3, 2015",4,Great Love this app. Can't believe I have been missing out this whole time. The only thing i would change is searching for certain sound clips a little easier. Other than that it's great!!
2517,Pmeissner,"December 21, 2015",5,I love this much better than musically Dub smash is so much fun! I love using it and it's super easy to share and view whenever you want. It's much better than any other lip syncing app ever made.

2526,RedmOrginal,"October 12, 2018",2,"Everything Is Good Except.... I like it, but I strongly think that the dubsmash video size should be the same as the old version because, you can barely see your video like this and it’s just it’s just better the way the size of the video was before.

Y’all need to change it back ASAP!!! That’s why we don’t use dubsmash anymore because y’all changed it to vertical.

2540,Aqua_Sparkles,"July 18, 2015",4,Just one thing. I'd really like for you to be able to pause it while you're recording yourself. Sort of like on Vine and Instagram. People could do stuff like the #DontJudgeMeChallenge on there if you could pause it.
2541,Monisy😊😊,"July 23, 2015",5,Great so funny This app is perfect when your bored. It's so funny and it's easy to use. You could upload it on any social media. And it's perfect when your hanging out with your friends. Love this app ☺️☺️👍🏻

Epic slow reverse fast time lapse).one more thing instead of pressing start to record it should be a press and hold button to record.
2549,Cicicianna,"December 1, 2015",5,Amazing and addicting I saw tons of people doing it and I didn't understand how much fun you could have while doing this! The more people in it the better!!
2550,AsuzuTheZulu,"February 26, 2015",5,I'm addicted! This is the coolest app ever! I like the face that it doesn't restrict you. It allows you to save it on your phone so that you can upload it to any social media network!!! 20 stars if I could...
2551,DubberRuck,"March 29, 2015",5,Hilarious Very entertaining and has just about every movie quote I've searched so far. Best part is you can add your own sounds if you can't find what you're looking for

2553,Prettygirl144,"April 28, 2015",4,Its cool It great and has really funny things on it but my problem is everytime i finish making a video it askes me to like on face book and when I press dont ask again it still says it like what if I don't want a Facebook 😡😡
2554,Vnexa,"April 29, 2015",4,"Really fun to use!!! It can create extremely hilarious videos to share with all your friends, family, and Internet fans. I would recommend it to anyone who loves being goofy and to make others laugh!"
2555,Captinfrodo,"May 8, 2015",5,Like You should be able to use already made videos instead of recording a new one
2556,Swag_gurl15,"June 18, 2015",4,"Great app ... Recommended 😋😋 *for teens Dubsmash is a very fun app and I recommend it to ages 14&up. However it has some bad words so other ages 1-13, it would not be appropriate. The kids are sensitive to this kind of thing. 👎👎 that's why it only got 4 stars... But otherwise ... Great!👌👌"
2557,BaddieBreee,"July 1, 2015",3,One Problem Thats Really Bad i like the app && all . but ever since i deleted dubsmash && re downloaded it . my dubsmashes will not save on the app so i can go back to save them . once i delete them out of my phone there gon . could you guys please fix what's wrong . i need to watch my old dubsmashes
2558,Hedgehorn Today is #1,"July 5, 2015",5,"I really like it I like it and all but every time I press ""Add to soundboard"" to add something to one, my soundboards don't come up. I press it multiple times and it still doesn't come up."
2559,i like the app.,"October 20, 2018",3,BRING THE FILTERS BACK I like how you guys changed it back vertical screened ! But we still do not have any of our filters which I over those because it made our video really pretty ! I wish in the next update that you could bring those back . Thank you !
2560,Kjamg93,"March 11, 2016",4,My profile is blank I just did the update like 5 minutes ago and I can't get back to my dubs on my profile. What happened? Will change to 5 stars when fixed.
2561,Chirag Pankhawala,"March 18, 2016",4,"My fav pass-time thingie! I love this app. Rarely saw any issues. I wish there was a play-pause/record/stop button integrated with iPhone volume button. Also, make a live feed to view hot new dubs that users post publicly."
2562,Byron reeves,"March 27, 2016",4,"Hilarious This app is pretty funny, love the variety that you can choose from the only issue I seem to have is that it will freeze often. It usually solves after closing the app and re opening it ."
2563,Airyy73,"August 22, 2016",1,"My Dubs Before the app updated to the new version, I did some videos and I sent them to my private dub space. I exit out from dubsmash for just a second or two, I wanted to go back and re watch what I did and it isn't there......😠 the new update probably deleted it as it was going cause now I did all those videos for nothing and I'm not doing it again.."
2564,miracle brownlee😆,"November 9, 2017",1,Opinion about the new update Dubsmash was my favorite app I used to love it so much until its newest update it’s horrible like I wish it can go back to saving them in the Dubsmash camera roll not the phone and it takes to long to play a certain song I used to love everything about it.. come on Dubsmash I know you can do better by going back to the old version plz
2565,Jalinangel,"January 20, 2018",3,Add the feature to where you can save your dubs to the “my dubs”!! Every time i make a dub it says download or save to your camera roll. There’s no way I can save them to the “my dubs” section. I would like it if you guys added that feature back on your next update.
2566,fsvybj,"March 27, 2018",4,Add slow-mo button I would like to be able to go into slow-mo during my dubs. It would make the videos so much cooler and a lot more people would download the app! I hope you take this into consideration!
2567,JadaLB,"August 4, 2018",4,Glad I’m so glad you guys updated because I wasn’t feeling the whole can’t save your dubs on your account anymore without others seeing. You had to save it to your phone.
2568,Aijah.P.Best,"September 20, 2018",4,Eh Sometimes when I’m finished with a dub it glitches to where I have to delete it. When I try to make a sound it always say network error when my connection is fine.
2569,lay😁,"October 5, 2018",1,Hate it At first I got on Dubsmash every day but now I’m just about to delete the app they changed everything the platform is hard to use and very difficult to find things the quality is not the same and I don’t like the new “recording” part of it i absolutely hate the update and would not recommend this app is now deleted from my phone🙃🤷🏽‍♀️
2570,Skyswen,"June 25, 2015",4,"I love this app but.., I can't always remember exactly what i am supposed to say so there should be an option of putting the words on the screen while recording, kinda like karaoke. I love dubsmash but this would make me love it even more 😊"
2571,Mrs.auggiebae,"June 27, 2015",5,Best app EVER PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!😘 This is the best app ever I made so much dubsmashes and there so funny the only problem I had is logging out and logging back in not finding my videos other than that it's amazing and fun to do
2572,Jinapson,"June 29, 2015",4,My little input Love the app! But as a little feature in the next update (if possible) to see how many people have used your added sound and to be able to see other peoples dubs.
2573,Tsbdjktwvwbdjcukf,"June 29, 2015",3,Love it but can't use it I've used this game before with friends and so I decided to get it my self but when I try to open it the D logo is fuzzy and after that the screen goes black and the app crashes.  I hope this can can be fixed because the app is super fun!
2574,Zipcity1,"July 9, 2015",5,This is soo dope !!!! I wish I could make them a touch longer ... Love dubsmash! ... Now I can't even upload a song clip anymore .. To make a dubsmash !! I get an error message ... New update stinks ... I want my dubsmash back
2575,Slave2java,"August 2, 2015",5,Days of fun I'm so glad my kids found this app! We have been making and sending clips to all of our friends and family.
2576,Jacquecake,"August 14, 2015",4,Can't Delete Dubs I absolutely love this app but with the new update I can't delete the dubs I don't want anymore. You should change that back so people can delete them.  That's the only complaint that I would have.
2577,SorryImAnonymous,"September 6, 2015",5,"SO Fun! I’m seriously obsessed with this game. It is extremely fun, but if you are buying for children, there are some explicit language on the app. Other than that, this app is addictive and fun to play."
2578,Datbombishchiic,"September 21, 2015",5,Fun ! Easy to use best app ever !😛😝😝 This app is super fun! I had to give it five stars ! It allows you to look up pretty much any song new or old and movie scripts ! Super easy to use I love it ! The best app on my iPhone ️plus 👏👏
2579,Harmoshawner,"February 17, 2016",4,❤️ I really like this app and I totally recommend it cause it's super fun and you have so many choices so if you are looking for a fun app to play with your friends and family or even by yourself this is definitely the one👌🏻❤️
2580,Bananas hannaa,"February 7, 2015",3,Great app!! I really like this app and it's a really good idea but one thing I think they need to fix on here is when you are recording there should be the words to what you are supposed to be setting up top so you don't mess up because some of the recordings are pretty long to memorize.
2581,ryphi12,"March 16, 2015",5,One of the most fun apps ever. I have already spent hours playing with this app and will continue to for a long time. I don't see his getting old any time soon.

2583,arndt.m,"April 21, 2015",4,idea for improvement my friends and I love this app we find it so fun. but we like to lypsinc over vines and our life would be 10x easier if on this app you could sign into your vine and go through your likes and revines
2584,shnally,"April 26, 2015",5,Greatest fun ever I am obsessed with this app. Seriously it is so fun. I have been sending these to friends and family all weekend. They say laughter is the best medicine and I will probably never ever get sick after this!
2585,Jjpollock,"May 10, 2015",5,Addictive and so fun!! A friend of mine showed this app to me and I have had so much fun responding to text messages this way or just playing around with it. My husband just shakes his head and calls me a nerd. 😂
2586,freakinaliyah,"May 26, 2015",4,"Love it but... It's a fun & great app, but it crashes a few times before I can use it. I have to wait at least a minute or two each crash then it works. It shouldn't have to be this way! It's fun overall and I love it a lot :)"
2587,#updatewasreallydumb,"June 6, 2015",4,Wish it had a better variety with less swear words Just seems like a lot of stuff has a bunch of swear words. And I wish there was more out there to choose from. Otherwise I like it a lot
2588,txkxktykvyvm,"October 13, 2018",1,"About the new dub smash This new update on dubsmash is horrible I wish I can get the old one back😩the camera quality is so ugly😑now I can’t post anymore vids on my instagram because of this ugly update please change it back ‼️y’all always ruin the apps and make them so ugly some people like it and some don’t, can y’all put 2 apps on play store and put the old one too please😩‼️"
2589,Aaliyah Hudson,"November 4, 2018",1,I hate it I use dubsmash to dance but know I don’t even wanna use it anymore... when I do a dubsmash it don’t come in the square shape and it’s to close to the screen I can’t use a front light nomore but on the new update yhu can only use the back I can’t even get the filters back I hope y’all can change it back to the old one like y’all did before or fix these things thanksss!
2590,CrysG78,"November 21, 2015",4,Love it but.... Love this app it does everything it says I do however wish it would download straight to Facebook without having to save it to my phone first as storage room on my iPhone is very limited.
2591,Vballplayer1🏐,"January 17, 2016",5,Love it but one thing The one thing is I wish it had full songs and things like musically where you can look at other peoples dubs
2592,Alexandra10116,"March 11, 2016",5,"Amazing! It is an amazing app you can spend hours on, and is great for curing boredom. I just wish the song clips could be longer than 9 seconds, but besides that it's amazing/awesome!!"

2596,Uju👐,"July 16, 2016",1,It's crazy I've had Dubsmash for a little over a year now and i have made probably over 50 videos and I haven't been on it for a week after the update and then when I got back on today all of my videos were gone I don't know how or why because I never deleted the app but all I want is my videos back because I had some funny memories on there
2597,Jayr_baby12,"January 28, 2018",2,Fix it asap I cant save any of my videos to my dubs I have to save I.T to camera roll and every time I go on the app the same songs from 3 weeks ago are still on the trending I don’t get any new songs this is getting really annoying you need to fix your system so I can do more dubs to different songs 🙄
2598,Jada Ziegler,"October 7, 2018",1,"I used to love this app but now I HATE IT!!! I 100% want to get rid of this new update!!!! It doesn't make any sense that I can't do everything I did with the old dubsmah. For example, I tried to make a dubsmash last night and the camera was so completely different that I didn't even want to save the video. And plus, this is going to make a lot of people go back to tik tok, including me!!!!"
2599,amour lia,"October 13, 2018",1,Trash update You destroyed dubsmash!! The frame for the videos is much smaller so when i do things it doesn’t fit into the video!! You took my sounds off like what is this?! Yea ok you improved quality but why would you make the video frame smaller?! That needs to get fixed asap!! I had to delete the app altogether because I’m a dancer and i can’t use it anymore to dance😐
2600,http.marisoll,"April 27, 2015",4,"I love it but When ever I record a dub it sometimes tells me couldn't save or problem recording, Idk if it's my phones storage or the app but pls fix if it's the app and also you should totally get it great app you have so much fun with it !!!! 😂👌🏽💘"
2601,DevilTB,"April 28, 2015",3,"Needs this now!!! It's fun but i don't see the point in having multiple sounds in one soundboard if you can only use one sound per video, should update it and make it so we can use multiple sound in a row or even out sounds in top of sounds in the video"
2602,SeanOzz,"May 7, 2015",3,Weird After downloading this all my ringtones and text tones switched back to default for some reason.  I've reset them and so far they are holding but it was a weird thing. So you might want to check your own after installing.
2603,Tarinabee,"May 24, 2015",5,Awesome Sauce!! This is app is a blast and fun to do with the kids just watch what you click some may not be labeled that way but definitely NOT for kids lol!! Would be cooler with a section just for kids!
2604,Mrsgritt,"June 19, 2015",4,App keeps crashing!! I love this app but for whatever reason it keeps crashing on me! I have an iPhone 6 with all the current software updates and app updates and it won't work 😩 please fix it!!

2606,Trini sistah,"July 23, 2015",5,Love it!! Best app of 2015!! Perfect way to entertain yourself and friends. It can keep you busy for quite a while too - great way to pass time. And you can practice your acting/creativity skills!
2607,Mer Chang,"August 14, 2015",4,"Slow&can't get the same video back It's slow when I use it,so annoying. And one more problem: I can't get the video I used to ""like"" at my Dub profile. I need it so that I can keep record the same Dub."
2608,Keilabutternut,"August 18, 2015",3,DELETE BUTTON?? I have tried numerous of times to delete my videos and it won't let me. I this that its very necessary to be able to delete certain unwanted videos. And many others are also having this same problem. Please fix ASAP.
2609,Jjllmm7,"September 19, 2015",5,Love it! I'm new to dubsmash but I already find myself thinking of what to look up to do next. I always loved movie and TV show quotes and this is way funnier than me doing the quotes myself!

2650,Tray_Tray_03,"April 30, 2016",3,The Best App But... This is a good app but it keeps crashing and deleting my dubsmashes. I had to uninstall this app four or more times. I just wish this would get fixed because I would like to enjoy making videos especially dancing ones.
2651,Madds1234567891011,"July 27, 2016",3,I love Dubmash I do wish they would change the Dubs sometimes but it is the best app. It is so much fun!! But sometimes everything stops working an do have to delete and download it again. Every time I lose all my dubs. You have to get and do it for yourself. God loves you! 😘
2652,Gigi15!,"August 6, 2016",5,I am frustrated  but I ❤️ it I think everyone should have this app but it won't let me change my profile dub. Please fix and it will be awesome ❤️💚
2653,Grizzle girl,"September 3, 2016",3,What the heck..... What in the world is up with having to hold the record button while making a dub like what the heck you can't even use both of your hands for it this was my favorite app until you guys did this. Ridiculous!
2654,GavinButler,"July 4, 2017",5,Very entertaining This app is very fun and has given a lot of good laughs. The only thing is that it is a bit laggy or glitchy sometimes but otherwise it's great!
2655,LaTonya75115,"October 31, 2017",4,Love this app but😬 My only problem is I’m used to saving my videos in my dubs and I don’t use my moments because I don’t want people looking at my videos I just myself looking at them😭Dubsmash can you guys pleaseeee fix that❤️
2656,Litt102,"November 5, 2017",1,No saving Also we can't save our dubs to our camera or see who seen the dubs this is crazy we can no longer save our dubs to “my dubs” nor can we put emojis on it we also can’t see who sees our dubs and we have to go all the way to our first dub to see our last this is making me mad and if it’s not fixed I will delete and stop using the app .😡
2657,SelfieQween👑,"November 5, 2017",2,Soooo what happened to “my dubs” I used to use this all the time. And I used to enjoy looking at my private dubs that were too goofy for anyone else to see. Please bring that back because I don’t have enough space to keep saving to my camera roll. I would’ve giving this 5 stars like a month ago.
2658,TheOfficialDorien,"October 11, 2018",2,Update 👎🏾 This new update has many great features BUT... i am asking for you guys to bring back the video filters and revert back to the old aspect ratio that the dubsmashes used to be displayed as. This smaller screen of video that you shoot now is the reason why most instagram dancers/dubsmash users has stopped using this app!
2659,lily/leelee,"October 14, 2018",4,Change it pls I don’t like the new dubsmash update everything is fine except when u record it’s square I would like it back where when u record it’s not square
2660,Loveness2001,"August 12, 2015",4,Needs delete button I love dubsmash but it really needs to have a delete option because its very annoying not being able to delete😒
2661,Singersville,"August 15, 2015",4,"Great app and fun! Some content too explicit... I haven't updated yet and I'm kinda afraid to from the reviews I see...but, the original app I love! Just one prob...too much explicit content! Maybe we can separate the dubs that have explicit language in it?"
2662,Megs-a-mill,"August 19, 2015",5,Love this!! I absolutely LOVE Dubsmash!! It's so fun to just dork out with your friends (or even by yourself haha!) and create HILARIOUS videos! Love love LOVE this app!! A friend of mine and I have been having 'Dubsmash wars' and it's too funny to even explain! I won of course ;)
2663,2nd_St_Annie,"August 21, 2015",5,Love to Dub A friend introduced me to Dubsmashing and we spent an entire evening dubbing back n forth.  I was instantly hooked!!! I can't sing but I look so much better doing it this way. Props get extra points!!
2664,Wowzerzers,"September 9, 2015",3,Very great but language This app is awesome but it should have children's mode because of the language goes too far. This app has funny dubs. But just letting the parents know about this app and how it cusses in a very bad language. But there are still a lot of fun dubs for kids. Thanks for reading!😋
2665,Satch623,"October 26, 2015",5,Great! But some Flaws. The app Dubsmash is amazing! 👍 but the app freezes every once in a while and I have to turn my phone of like 5 times. Needs an update. ASAP!
2666,Swimmer428🐬,"October 27, 2015",5,Da best!!! It is sooooo addicting. I love it because you an send random messages to your friends and it is really fun just to see yourself talking funny or something. I highly recommend this game.
2667,quickjasonquick,"December 12, 2015",5,"So much fun! There are so many funny options to use right off the bat, and more keep getting added. I am having way too much fun with this."
2668,ninacavini,"December 25, 2015",4,So fun and addicting! I love this app but sometimes the video and sound don't match up and it would be nice to have more variety that isn't just mainstream pop/reality show/hip hop.. How about some more old school options!
2669,Chana brukman,"January 25, 2016",5,Funny sounds Dubsmash is so funny because you can make yourself lip singing to the real song it's really cool how it works that way .funny sounds make my day so put more funny sounds thank you 😀😀😀😎😎😎👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
2670,Beckyslove,"April 27, 2015",5,Lots of fun! My friends and I live several hours away from each other and we take it to the next level and dress up like the dub- so fun
2671,tiffanyannhowar,"May 13, 2015",5,"It is my fire, my one desire I love this app so much I left my first review since becoming an apple user 6+ years ago...get this app because it's the most enjoyable procrastination tool"
2672,Im_Feirce😋,"May 21, 2015",5,DumSmash I love this because I get to post things on Instagram and send them to my friends and sometimes with my friends at sleepovers! So I would give this a ten out of ten!  I love this app it is so fun!
2673,Nicky_nix,"May 24, 2015",5,Sooo addicting! Wish there was a way to view more options instead of having to search
2674,Bfamily2377654,"May 28, 2015",5,"Love it! This is by far one of my favorite apps! I wish there were more ways to edit the dub.  Trim, add more stickers at a certain time in the video, etc.  "
2675,Tara LegMac,"June 27, 2015",4,So much fun!!! Love this app! It hilarious !!!! Great fun between friends and I! But after some videos it won't let me record and send them. even if   it's not saving the video to my phone and I deleted a bunch of stuff. But still love this app!!!!
2676,GoingRogue,"July 14, 2015",5,"New Toy Dubsmash is pretty fun!! Doesn't have that many problems but with the couple of problems, they're easy fixes. It's my new addiction and I love playing with it!!"
2677,mickeyfan64,"July 16, 2015",5,Filter-Family/Explicit Love this app! One thing definitely should happen is need to label family/kid safe or explicit. Can not safely use with children present. Please make this happen :)
2678,Jennifer_Siegell_Severino,"July 23, 2015",5,Best app ever!! Omg! If you're looking for a lot of laughs download this app!! I have created a circle of dubbers within my network that keep me on my toes and make me want to improvise with props with my dubs! They should have a dub contest!!
2679,Dkjdhhshajkakdbakalsjx,"July 23, 2015",4,"Amazing!! But just ONE thing, I want to be able to pause the video but know where I left off so I can start it again so I can make the rest of the video in a different place. Does that make sense?"
2680,Naetimes2,"March 1, 2015",5,Nae One of the best apps in the App Store I personally think it's so much fun and hilarious I don't make regular videos no more.. Would be cooler if you could share video on vine or snap chat easier
2681,Tabitha Barrineau,"April 16, 2015",5,Love it! Great laughs and easy to use! The only complaint is that some of them are vulgar and have very foul language making it hard for my kids to use.
2682,Gmonay32,"April 18, 2015",5,Really fun. Wish there was a easier way to make the tracks Really fun. I wish there was an easier way to make recordings of quotes not already in the app.
2683,Hadji subsidy,"January 27, 2017",5,It's great I have way too much fun with this app. Any chance for better quality recordings? Some of my favorite you can't hear very well
2684,Aniyah Mcdowell,"January 30, 2018",5,Review I love the app but I do not like the update because you can’t save them to your dubs and only your moments and now it’s acting weird it’s no new trending sounds.
2685,Hey please change,"October 9, 2018",1,"Why? I am not happy with the update I can no longer send dubs to my friends or have friends on it, I can no longer pause it during the dubs which most of my dubs require, there are no more filters."
2686,tayy0415,"October 12, 2018",1,"Do not update!! I do not like this update AT ALL !!the videos are always flipped when you save them, they save in “square mode” and the whole app is just pointless now I love the old update better because the videos saved how you wanted them to and you didn’t have to worry about you videos being flipped which makes the videos look dumb 😭👎🏽"
2687,yeeaa.sydd,"October 16, 2018",5,Go back You guys need to go back to the old Dubsmash for all the Instagram dancers more people stopped using your app when you updated it
2688,restanicole,"October 19, 2018",1,"HORRIBLE This is the worst update in history. Me and my bestfriend have been sending each other dubs since 6th grade which was 3 years and there was hundreds of memories in there!! this update has changed so much about dubsmash when it was perfectly fine and I don’t understand your point of this horrendous update, fix it cause I can’t stand to use this monstrosity."
2689,plugwalker122,"October 29, 2018",4,Dubsmash complaint I hate the new update I can’t even get back in my old page and we can’t even sign in with Facebook no more and the quality is bad bring the old Dubsmash back please PLEASE !!!!!!!
2690,janinemckeon,"October 13, 2015",5,"What happened? Love, love, love this app!! But what happened to the option to delete sounds off of a soundboard? Now you can only report, share or add it to another soundboard. Help?"
2691,Standuppat,"December 26, 2015",5,Love this app! I'm a stand up comic and can tell I'm going to have more fun with this app than I already have! It's a great way to entertain my followers across social media and just plain fun!
2692,Kvboogie,"January 22, 2016",5,Awesome I love this app I use to hate because when you started started immediately but now that has a timer to give you time I love this app
2693,Amna9,"January 23, 2016",5,"Fun! Hilariously funny, acting out funny scenes from movies, lip-syncing to a song, you name it! Fun to do with friends and Family and Love the new features which kind of make it look like Snapchat"
2694,Jaortionist,"February 13, 2016",3,"Pleas Fix Okay Dubsmash had been actin up lately. Like someone said, after I record a video it goes to the creating screen, but after that the screen goes black and then it exits out of the app. Please fix this and I will return the 5 star rating."
2695,Dvjnsn,"March 21, 2016",5,"5 stars! I'm 54 years old.  I don't know how to use a 10th of the stuff this phone can do but, I love Dubsmash!!  I can send little videos that even my grandchildren think are cool!"
2696,Fukumeeen,"March 27, 2016",5,"Zoom in!!! The app is great but all it needs to have is the ability to zoom in. If it's possible, it would complete the app."
2697,gxyleee,"May 7, 2016",3,"Having second thoughts ‼️PLEASE READ‼️ I honestly love the app. But, after 5mins on the app it glitches out. I also liked the feature when you add a sound and ""select from ITunes"" but it's gone. I actually used it to make my dubs sound more quality."
2698,Viedlabxl,"July 22, 2016",4,"The update I tried to log in and log back out like you said but that didn't work so hopefully you'll figure something out because these dubs mean a lot to me, thank you."

2703,ItsJAMi,"April 30, 2015",4,"Amaze balls I love this app! I can't get enough of it! My friends and I have a blast with it! Sometimes when sending via text message it doesn't attach the video correctly, that's my only complaint."
2704,Marybethstansberry,"May 5, 2015",4,LOVE IT The reason i gave it only 4 stars is because I thought that I should have more options on what to say also I think that they should be able to pause it. How ever besides all of that it is great
2705,LumperJohn,"May 11, 2015",5,Yup Love this app. I hope whoever made it is getting rich because they deserve it with all the joy and fun it has brought me and all my friends. I wish I had thought of it.

2707,Super smokey 101,"June 19, 2015",4,Awesome! I think dubsmash is a great app because it is funny . But the reason that I didn't put five stars is because it has some bad words in it. So I don't think this app is appropriate for little kids . But it is still a funny nice app!😍
2708,Todd in Detroit,"June 21, 2015",5,"Amazing I've never written a review before, but I'm compelled to say this is the best app idea I've seen in many, many years! Bravo! Many hours of fun with friends and family. Hilarious!!!"

2714,Nick Ang,"March 3, 2015",5,Really fun app This is a simple app and it is really fun to play with. You can add your own sound or use other users sounds. Sometimes the final result doesn't preview. Fix that and it's super.
2715,Dita Von Kitty,"March 8, 2015",5,"Best app ever!!!! I have tried many, upon many apps, and kids this is the bombiggty! Foreals! My boo lives in eg land and we always exchange music and videos! This is the best way you can exchange both! Awesome! Simply awesome!!!!"

I used to make a dance videos on dubsmash but now i can't even figure out how to work it ! i spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to work it and i still don't get it . i believe that all we really needed is a update that fixes the glitches not a whole new update ! now i cant make my dance videos 🤦🏽‍♀️ . thanks anyway
2719,ABPayton,"November 7, 2018",3,The new update The new update isn’t as good because I still had old videos and it isn’t on my new update anymore. You should bring back the filters because I don’t like the normal lighting flash on the camera.
2720,The.Only.Cecelia,"May 23, 2016",2,Hate the update Omg so mad So made it keeps deleting my dubs after I make them the app has changed completely I make a good dub then after 10 seconds off watching it it then deleted it just closes the app please go back to the first  dubsmash or fix these problems but other wise I love this app
2721,Lalalaland._,"May 30, 2016",3,"Well...I like it but fix these Dubsmash is great, I like the update with the extra colors and stuff but I can't add sounds to my soundboard. Everytime I make a video and press finish, it always logs me out and takes me to my homepage screen!! Please fix this issue. Other wise it's great👌🏼👍🏽"
2722,Tulopiyhtgdf,"June 28, 2016",2,I HATE THIS Dubsmash deleted all my dubs I suggest you update because this is really execrable. Are you even trying to fix this because it has had the same dumb glitches for a while now. I'm going to delete this app immediately. This is so stupid. It won't let me log in. I thought this app was better than that. I HATE THIS!!'n
2723,I_TØP_Smol_/Beans,"September 11, 2016",1,DUBSMASH I USED to love DUBSMASH! But every time is updates it gets slower and slower! I haven't got on it in forever because it takes minutes to just open the app. And sometimes it opens then unexpectedly closes.  Not to mention (which btw outraged me) it deleted all my old dubs! And some of my new ones! IT DELETED my dubs I first ever made on my birthday with my best friend! It's ridiculous!! Actually improve when u update DUBSMASH! ROTTEN TOMATO!
2724,Bro2300,"December 14, 2016",2,Exclamation I like this app a lot but I really hate how long the dubs are and there are no filters or modes like musically I am sorry but it just is not coool that way so get your butts up and get those filters and modes please I am not trying to be mean or anything but please oh please get modes I would really like that but in lame mans terms I hate this app
2725,javae🤪,"May 13, 2018",2,my dubs when i first downloaded this app it was working fine i made lots of dubs BUT when i got a new phone i downloaded the app again all of my dubs were gone. i can’t get all of my memories back. today is mother’s day and i need my videos with my mom. i think you should fix this problem ASAP
2726,Raquel😌,"October 5, 2018",2,The “Update” Everything on the app was fine until they let me download the new update 😤.... I cant see my friends videos of what they have done. I cant see my own videos to see when it says “My Dubs” 😒. This update is plain booty and I wish they would change it right on back😗!
2727,Queen.mya,"October 6, 2018",1,"Horrible I updated it and it logged me out , so I tried to log in and it loads then stops loading. It won’t let me log in my account or even change the pw. I tried to make a new account and it just does the same thing. Loads and then stops loading. You all need to work on that. Because now I have no dubsmash account and I’m frustrated!"
2728,niyahslayy11,"October 7, 2018",2,"Not a Fan of the update This update is completely garbage you can’t see your whole body, the sound board is ugly and difficult/different,my dubs are out in the open. Please go back to the old this new Dubsmash is not the same please please‼️go back to the old or I won’t be using this app any more‼️"
2729,Evaaa🤩,"October 12, 2018",1,Horrible and won’t use it again. The new dubsmash update is HORRIBLE. It only lets you make square-shaped videos. (Before it updates you could make screen sized videos and square.) The quality is worse than the lest version. And it flipped the screen so you see yourself backwards. I will never use this again until it changes back. 🙄🖕🏼
2730,Kreechuh,"August 17, 2015",3,"Can't Delete Videos Before the latest update, I was able to delete the dubsmash videos I no longer wanted to keep. I am unable to find this option after the latest update. Otherwise, this ap is great!"

2732,Madison Schultes,"September 5, 2015",5,AWESOME Honestly I love this app❤️ but it only lets you play a dubsmash for 15 secs😵 I know it's not a big deal but I just want you people to know that! Every thing else is perfect!! By this I'm sure you will love it!❤️💋
2733,Toshinika,"October 18, 2015",5,Awesomeness!!!! Ok so my friend showed my this app and it's life!!! You maybe asking why.. Well not only can u act out while awesome voice plays but u can share it with your friend!!!!loves!!!!
2734,I love my kitty,"November 21, 2015",4,9% I'm giving the app a mine out of ten. I wish it would tell more on how to do more things. When I go to create a sound it says to put three tags and hit return. I don't know what a tag is! It makes me so mad!😤😡😑
2735,Kxodojwnaiizam,"November 22, 2015",5,Pretty good one problem Great app it just crashes way too much. I use it for 15 minutes it crashes three times.

2737,Gib 07,"January 7, 2016",4,Dubsmash is my pash I  love dubsmash! It is really easy to use and it's also really fun! You can use it for many different events and it is very very cool! The only problem is that sometimes it blacks out. But that's OK because overall it's great!
2738,Leaht12,"April 7, 2016",4,Dunsmash Dubsmash is a really fun and funny app the voices are funny but one thing I have a problem with is sending it to other social apps such as musically other than that the game is AMAZING you guys should download it so far I have no other probs!!!!
2739,Kayy😂😍,"May 7, 2016",1,"I hate it now😡 I love the app but it is just confusing now. It needs to go back to the way it used to be, and all my dubs are gone. I think we should be able to still have our dubs if we have an account. If we didn't have to rate I would pick no stars and I'm giving this update one star. Change it back the way it used to be and I need my dubs BACK😡😡😡"
2740,Disappointed Jonny,"May 1, 2015",5,"Love it Too funny, I love it! Especially since it's not one of those apps that blocks you from posting without paying something."
2741,NJ Original,"May 2, 2015",5,"Dubsmash is the bomb! Try this app, and you will enjoy at least one weekend of constant hilarity with your friends sending many videos"
2742,ChicanaFeliz,"May 10, 2015",5,"Brilliant! Better than movies The fans build hilarious films. It democratizes the media. We're not just fans anymore, we're producers and dubsmash gives you that power. Ty to the creators!"

I thought this update didn’t make sense because most people use this app for dance videos. Also the controls to play the video changed. The update could have just fixed the bugs.

Then I got a new phone but the updates had made it so that the audio didn't Synch past 5 seconds of video. Now it won't allow me to pull audio in from iTunes. This app has one function and it's never been up to the task. Just use iMovie.
2803,Catdog4099,"July 22, 2016",3,Few Problems I really have liked this app for a while but now it's getting messed up. When ever I shoot my films it makes it super slow afterwards. I like some improvements but I think dubs mash was better at its original version.

2860,Leelee🌸💜,"July 6, 2016",3,Omg!!!!😡🖕🏿 Y'all really should start saving dubs like when you delete the app and download it back your dubs are gone like I jus got a new phone so when I downloaded it and logged in my dubs were gone!!! 🙄🙄🙄 this gonna make me wanna delete it but so far it's good i guess👍🏽
2861,Kayteam,"July 15, 2016",5,Dubsmash Total Fun😩😏😉😈 Love it!!!!! Super fun and easy to use!!! A must app to have! Fun for all the family as well! Lets you get your creative side out and all who is around will be laughing! Chk it out! ✌🏾️
2862,EveryVillain,"August 27, 2016",2,"... I decided not to bother trying to do anything with the app after the like 5 minutes of inputting pointless info and being forced to invite my friends. I chose a landline to avoid annoying anyone. And then you like can't use your own music, so what exactly is the point of this app? Haha."
2863,Randomword21,"November 24, 2016",2,"Bit annoying no privacy Kind of annoying how when you're in favorites or a list and you make a dub, it automatically puts you back at the homepage afterward instead of where you were in that list. I wish I could make my dubs private!"
2864,hsh06,"November 7, 2017",2,"“My Dubs” Overall I like Dubsmash as a whole, but I just have a problem with the new update. Why can’t we save to ‘My Dubs’ anymore? I don’t want to post my videos to ‘My Moments’ or save to my camera roll all the time. That takes up space and I’d rather have all of my Dubs in the actual app. Please fix this."
2865,Crissipoo,"April 8, 2018",3,Its greta but.. Its wont save my dubs like i save it and then i go to the dubs that iv done and it would say “u have not done any dubs” and i get frustrated and the only way i can see them is when im done making my dub and i press the thing at the top and it lets me see my dubs.
2866,dcjfnfnff,"September 7, 2018",1,Fix it Y’all need to get this together every single time I go on Dubsmash it glitches and go back to my home screen I’m tired of having to go back in the app y’all need to get that together real quick bc I’m getting tired of doing the same thing over and over again frfr like it’s getting annoying at this point‼️this is unacceptable
2867,lanniiiC,"October 13, 2018",3,"I hate it. I used to love this app but now i dislike it very much because the old set up was perfect. Now, I hate the way they made the camera look like when you record. I hope they change that back🙄."
2868,Follow me on Instagram 😏,"October 15, 2018",1,"DONT UPDATE you all are losing a lot of people because of the new update, the version before 4.0 was much better because it was easier to access, also it says that my email already exists but when i log in it says email not available, this is honestly the worst app ever now, and i lost all my dubs before i logged out."
2869,Gjcchcvhch,"October 20, 2018",4,"Disappointed The new format for the app is cool I really like it, but when it comes to recording it’s kinda bad... it will only let me film in a tiny square I can’t film it portrait. Can y’all fix that?"
2870,Thudson99,"November 22, 2015",4,Love DS! I'm addicted ever since I saw Selena Gomez and J Fallon use it! I also noticed Marc Martel loves it too! My kids are freaked out by my videos but I still like to have fun in my fifties! This is great for ANY age! Wish the tag was a smaller font when you post though.
2871,Sophia murad,"December 21, 2015",5,The lol app😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😇😇 Personally I think this a really funny app and a pretty good app but I do get a lot of glitches in this app but other then that this app is a great app you should definitely by the 😇
2872,Joeo124512,"January 8, 2016",4,Great app... Just needs a little more Overall this app is great! Easy to use easy to send. The only thing it's missing is a couple little creative extras that would really make it awesome!
2873,superchase12345,"January 18, 2016",5,Fix the rating The restrictions don't let me open the app I can only play apps that are 9+ fix it or i will hunt you down for ever

2876,Mine craft complainer,"April 30, 2016",2,"I hate the update! The update made me delete all my dang stuff and would not allow me to remove a friend or remove my dub profile I had to delete it!

2878,Ramiyah102005,"May 15, 2016",5,Five stars I gave dub smash five stars because this is The only app that lets me act like I'm singing the song and it has all of my favorite songs.
2879,PozeyLovesYou,"May 20, 2016",2,Take me back The updated version keeps kicking me off when I'm trying to save a dub. I never had any issues with it messing up until it was updated. The glitches either need to be fixed or just go back to the old version.
2880,ToddCassHill,"June 29, 2015",5,Best app EVER!!! This app is amazing and so much fun. I use it with my kids and other family members. I only wish that the songs were longer.
2881,Odalys G,"July 8, 2015",4,Perfect but... Ok so idk if it's just my phone or the app but anyways so when I Iike record a dubsmash it like repeats what I recorded over and over until I either leave the app or delete it and get it again.
2882,lmaoari,"July 8, 2015",5,"Perfection I honestly in my 4 years of owning Apple products, found a better app than dubsmash. It's very fun and gets you going. I love it! 5 stars hands down!"
2883,Hova77,"July 25, 2015",4,One of the most amazing time wasters out there This is endless fun if you are even half as silly as me and my friends. Clear the memory on your phone bc you're going to saving a ton of videos. Lol.
2884,Dubsmash of Lukash,"October 9, 2015",5,"Get hooked! DS is the best addiction I have had. It's kept me up all night.... A few times. Creative juices finally flowing again and it's awesome. Get the app, and get brave! Awesome and DS has my back. Love it! Do it!"
2885,Dclopez5,"October 16, 2015",4,Love this app This app is wonderful for entertainment! I love sending goofy videos to friends. One downside is that sometimes it crashes and you lose the video. Overall super fun and easy to navigate.
2886,Alpabz,"October 18, 2015",5,Need update Ios 9.02 is not supported where-areas the app just freezes at the loading screen.

2890,PleasedPicturePoster,"May 10, 2015",5,"So much fun!! My daughter and I LOVE this app!! We can't stop making videos. Will be even more fun once I figure out how to make my own sounds, I'm not as tech savvy as I once was."
2891,dalami81,"May 11, 2015",2,"Fun, but... Two stars for how fun the app is, but the ""unexpected error"" issue keeps it at just two stars. Part of the issue is that I can't upload my own sounds because the camera fails. That's kind of the whole point to this app. Fix that issue and I'll come back to give more stars."

2895,Markgomes808,"June 2, 2015",5,Extremely fun !! This so is one of those things that you can have fun with and all of you friends notice and laugh with you. Amazing idea and a great social builder. A++++++
2896,Tommyservo,"June 3, 2015",3,Fun. But needs a couple improvements The one thing I would absolutely love is if this app were to increase the time limit just a little and add an optional countdown before the audio begins. Just a 3-2-1 countdown would be great to help me get ready for the performance.
2897,AmandaNM6289,"June 5, 2015",5,Love it! 😍😍 My only complaint is that MyDubs are no longer saving on the app (but I can easily just send them to myself in a message for now).
2898,Brianna Holmes,"June 21, 2015",5,A for effort It's a great app. I wish there were funnier choices in the comedy section because I like making funny dubsmashes. But it's definitely awesome aside from that.
2899,Smlin20,"June 28, 2015",5,"Hysterical. Love this app. Can't stop sending messages to friends, although I had to google directions to figure it out."
2900,maC_is_Stack,"March 15, 2015",5,Great app It's a great app but the only thing that's wrong with it is that it told me to check my storage space when I have a lot of storage space remaining...

2922,EvansMommy61911,"October 27, 2015",5,Love it! I love this app. It's super fun and so silly! The only thing that I could imagine making it any better would be captioning for the dubsmash video your recording.

2967,Tinalulu💗,"July 7, 2016",1,"DO NOT BUY AT ALL COSTS!!😡 I bought this app and enjoyed it for a while but then I realized you can not replace or delete your profile dub, and everyone can see your profile dub, at this point I was very ticked off, so I tried to delete the app, and it wouldn't let me!! Do not buy this app it is terrible, and doesn't give you any control over your account!!"
2968,Spaceraider0,"July 8, 2016",3,It's Alright but .....ehhh It constantly bugs; The first time the app had deleted ALL of my favorites so I just let it slide. And just recently I got up there and it had deleted all of my dubs from the day before (about 7 of them ) . I'm highly upset.
2969,Keimaa,"July 9, 2016",5,Mydubs 🙂 Is there another way to view your dubsmashes? The list view takes too long; I have a lot of dubsmashes.
2970,Chop it'd,"June 3, 2015",5,So funny Well I love it. That's all I could say or I would ramble on but it is passed my bedtime. I recommend getting it me and my friends always chat with this
2971,Cloudyuuh,"June 14, 2015",5,"Very entertaining!! I never write reviews but when the app asked me if I wanted to I was like why not, this app is pretty awesome. It's so funny. I send these to my friends all the time."
2972,Bb1250,"June 24, 2015",4,It needs different song I have to do some of the same songs all the Time and a song starts off way What would you do about it ????

2978,allison😂,"August 13, 2015",5,love this app I absolutely love the app but there is one problem it needs a delete button to delete ur dubs 😇 n also plz fix the update
2979,Mearbear99878,"August 29, 2015",4,I wish it could be longer..and no tags! I wish you could do a whole song and I also don't like how hard it is to tag I don't understand
2980,Conzak,"March 31, 2015",1,New Update is bad When I add text to videos it won't let me put more than 6 words. You can't even put full sentences. Before it was just fine but you made it worse and I should be able to put stickers and text. And why not make dubsmash like vine where we can upload it to a dubsmash feed like think about the opportunities.
2981,FarmBoySD,"March 31, 2015",4,"Overall A Great App I love this app and have had a lot of fun with it, but is there any chance we'll have the option to pay to remove that enormous watermark? Or at least reduce the size?"
2982,Super girl 04,"April 4, 2015",5,Best app!! This app is Amazing and hilarious!! I love when you can pick sounds and turn them into Comedy video!! I would definitely recommend❤️
2983,DeiqhMamii,"April 8, 2015",5,"It's cool EXCEPT.. It keeps saying that my camera stopped working! Frustrating I tell ya, then it'll make me restart the app in order to make another video!"
2984,Bittersweet1989,"April 15, 2015",4,Great app but.... There should be an option to send to friends on snapchat I feel like it would be a lot easier to share with friends that way.
2985,Superking430,"April 17, 2015",3,"It's fun but... This app is really fun and smart idea. However, they currently rely on guests to post the dub tracks which makes the system unreliable and often becomes boring because there are few new songs added etc..."
2986,Azboxer07,"April 19, 2015",4,Funny as hell!! I find funny audio clips and have a blast acting them out! My friends constantly ask me for more dubs. I use the search engine and usually find what I'm looking for.
2987,Kkosoor,"May 25, 2015",5,Love it My family and I (across the globe) have been dub smashing for last couple of weeks and it became our mode of communication.

2990,Ronifuego,"February 10, 2015",4,Crashes at times but still amazing! I usually never review apps but if there is one app that gave me great entertainment it's dubsmash. Definitely recommend it and am surprised you're not number 1 yet!
2991,SarahLeslieKing,"March 17, 2015",4,Love it This app has improved my life. It makes me laugh so hard. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I wish there were more options for dubbing.
2992,**Insomniac**,"March 20, 2015",5,"Hilarious, addicting fun! I have had a blast making these videos w my family and friends. Lots of great sound clips too."
2993,Jhill3535,"March 21, 2015",4,"Needs censors or parental controls I love the app but won't let my kids play on it. If there was a way to rate clips (like G, PG, MA, etc) limit use by minors to only multi-rated clips it would be much better.  Also NSFW tags would be a good enhancement."
2994,SouthernBelle312,"March 31, 2015",5,"Hilariously Entertaining Awesome, that's all there is too it. Mine never crashes, lags, or gives me problems. It's the best way to procrastinate writing my thesis due in a month. 👌"

3000,illgmkeanedu,"October 3, 2017",1,"Horrendous. Dubsmash is a complete piece of garbage that deleted LOADS of my finely-crafted dubs, leaving just 65 of them...I had had at least a gross (144), possibly over 200. Dressed up for 'em and everything, used props, did many many versions of each line. Now more than half are gone, including some of the very best ones. Needless to say, I've deleted this wretched piece of refuse."
3001,Lila Knight,"January 7, 2018",3,"Good... But a Few Errors This is a great game and all, but it would be better if they fixed it up a bit. I mean, there is a lot dirty stuff on there, so it's more recommended for ages 14+. But, I mean... it's a pretty good game and all... but there could be a few changes."
3002,Teniaha,"February 16, 2018",5,Trending issues Dubsmash is a great app but lately my trending music has been giving me a issue i can get any new sound anymore😭😭🚮

3004,apollobearcreed,"April 28, 2018",4,It won’t let me download Like I don’t even know what the app is like because I can’t even download the app Itself like it’s so annoying because everybody has it but me 🙄
3005,A.Milleret,"October 6, 2018",2,Terrible!!! I hate this new update I miss the old one!!!!!🙄 Change it back to putting the text bar like snapchat. It’s so difficult looking for sounds😒Trust me you are about to start losing a lot of people because of the way you changed the app. I’m very Furious with Dubsmash right now......!
3006,ariana🖤❤️,"October 7, 2018",3,No ! Unfortunately I do not like the new update because of the movie type camera or whatever .. it’s hard to do dancing videos because of it’s not showing for head to toe like the regular Dubsmash before
3007,user20188,"October 8, 2018",1,The update isn’t really good I gave 1 star out of 5 because the update is making my dubs that I have saved before look different. Now I can’t see the full video because it got automatically cropped. Also since not that many people used dubsmash before the update will not likely decrease the amount of users.
3008,aaniyah seymore,"October 14, 2018",1,New update The new dubsmash app is so lame . The videos can only be saved in square and there is no more filters . You took away moments and I didn’t even get to save the ones I had to my phone . The needs to go back to the older version or find out a way for me to get the old version because this new version ain’t it ‼️‼️‼️😴
3009,Symphony joy,"October 14, 2018",1,I hate the new update it’s terrible This new update is horrible I hate it I want the old one back. I can’t even make a dub because they can’t see me all the way and it no longer has a filter. Like sis we all not that cute and we depend on the filter to give us a little shine. So can you please do me a favor and please give us the old Dubsmash back .😩😩
3010,Spolea0,"April 8, 2016",3,Need more Camera settings and editing effects Need to update camera settings by adding additional features like enable or disable flipping videos after dub. Sometimes mirror videos look weird.

3030,J____taylor,"May 4, 2015",2,Fun app but...... This is a very fun app. But I really dislike the way it is organized and the amount of stupid voice recordings people upload. Bi*** this and N****r that. That's all I hear. It has potential but I had the app for 2 weeks and deleted it because it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be.

3047,Dazia Vu,"October 6, 2018",1,😕 I love Dubsmash. But this new update is a no. U such put the videos back the same and keep the feed. The video sizes are too small. I just don’t like it. And it’s so complicated u have to face the camera far away just to see your whole body for when I dance which is unacceptable. So plzzz change it backkk!!! And just upgrade the quality.
3048,Nubian_Essence,"October 13, 2018",1,"Bring The Old Dubsmash Back This New Dubsmash Is Very Bad , The Videos Are In Little Squares And We Odnt Like That At All , Also The Filters Are Gone And We Liked The Filters, I Don’t Like The Way The Letters Look Either At The Bottom Of The Video We Make.

3083,Gen.PattonsBananas,"May 29, 2015",3,"Got it for my kids and very fun but tons of inappropriate content This is a great app and very fun. But it's playing content roulette not knowing what you're going to get throughout the categories. If you're allowing young kids to play with it, it requires censoring for sure."
3084,Roll me,"May 30, 2015",5,Too much fun Me and my children send our recordings back and forth and we laugh and laugh until we cry. Live it!
3085,WeepinAngel,"May 30, 2015",4,"Videos are watermarked It would be great if there was an option to remove the watermark, paid or not. It's fantastic that we can contribute our own sounds."

3204,HomeEducator,"February 16, 2016",3,I'd love to give a 5 but.... I adore this app however in order to give it a 5 star rating it would need to be more family friendly.  I wish there was a way to filter the sexually explicit content and foul language.

3210,Jaylapapers,"July 5, 2015",4,When I sign out😡😡😡 When I sign out or when dubsmash resets itself it deletes all the videos you did that on you dumsmash other than that dubsmash is fine.
3211,Roclexollojack,"July 7, 2015",5,Fun!! So much fun! My kids and grandson get a kick out of seeing my Dubs. Love to explore. Not a fan of the ones with cursing however. Other than that it's a hit!

Was one of my favorite apps and I really want to love it. Also: it would be really cool if there were filters and if we could pause while recording. But please let me record again!!! Very disappointed.

3241,Kalia223,"December 25, 2016",2,App I hate that you have to hold the button to record and I don't want to hold the phone while I'm recording so can you just make it to where you can tap it and it starts recording because holding the phone is annoying.
3242,AaronALLIN,"November 24, 2017",1,Don't like the up grade This would be so much better if you would have kept the dubsmash file like it was .. 
3243,Blabablac,"March 4, 2018",3,Trending The trending has been the same songs for the past 2 weeks y’all need to change it because there are no other sounds for me to use anymore !!!!!

3249,Jordan 🤪,"October 12, 2018",1,Why an update This very unneeded update was just stupid like you where the only app that stayed the same until now like what is the point I enjoyed being able to see my body and the filters also I pretty sure 90 percent of you users liked the old one better than this trash 🙄😑

I remember the glory days when Dubsmash was an AWESOME app. Don't get me wrong, there are some really cool features with this version. But if it can't perform the basic functions of what I'm asking, then why would I bog down my phone? "

3275,N*t*lie•,"June 29, 2015",3,Pretty good This app is very fun and addicting I haven't yet experienced any difficulty with this. It is very easy to use and very fun but some of the quotes are inappropriate. Like the vines. So you must expect to hear some swear words. But other then that it is a great app.

3458,Anonymousshrilanka,"October 23, 2018",1,The update is terrible I think that before this update was made when you made videos it would show your full body but now when you make videos it crops out your legs and part of your hair or head and I think the app should go back to the way it was
3459,gsbannzjzk,"December 1, 2018",3,Change it Can you change the camera size and put the filters back on
3460,Conceited_dontcare,"September 11, 2017",5,"Litt😝 Dubsmash is litt y'all should deff download dis while y'all got the chance,I dance a lot so using dubsmash makes it easier so I can do a dance to any song 💪🏽🔥!"

If you can make this happen I would happily enjoy the app more and use it more. Please and thank you - torii"

3464,niyah1935293,"October 7, 2018",1,It is worst now Ok so many Instagram dancers updated the Dubsmash at so the quality was already kinda bad but we could still to full body’s and half body’s but now we can’t and the quality is really bad now and wayyyyy worst and we can’t even do half body’s or half body’s now so could u pls fix tht it is so bad now
3465,mari hurley,"October 7, 2018",1,I dislike the update Because it makes it harder for people who use Dubsmash for dance videos that’s the only reason why it got famous 🤷🏾‍♀️ pay attention to ur trending sounds more people use it to dance and now we can’t no more so I’m gonna try to find another app until this is fixed
3466,Dani3//eD33,"October 9, 2018",1,Horrible screen size This update is horrible I wish I could go back to the old update You literally took all the good things in this app and threw them away. My biggest problem is the screen size 🙄 Its horrible and it’s hard to dance in a little ol square camera Please change this!!!!
3467,Datt.Mimi,"October 11, 2018",1,Bring back the other version I hate it the new version updates you have to put your camera and I specific spot so that it can see you and it barely sees my head most of the time + you can’t even put a text on it anymore😡😭 please bring back the old one
3468,Laii_bxby,"October 15, 2018",1,Terrible update 😕 I have had Dubsmash for a few years but this new update is terrible. The camera to make dubs is too small and you can’t share memories anymore. This the worst update Dubsmash has ever had yet. I really hope this app goes back to its old version because I do not like this update.
3469,a really cood idea maker,"October 16, 2018",1,Bad The app is super slow like when I go to trending that’s when everything slows down and but when I go to favorite everything is fast but you guys should make your app a WiFi free so people can use it without WiFi much batter everyone would love it and more people would download it

3532,Mia0030,"April 29, 2016",4,"Booo Ever since i got the newest update, every time I open the app it goes right back to the home screen! Please try to fix that!"
3533,Okay04,"April 30, 2016",1,No update I miss the old Dubsmash because before this it was easy to look at your old dubs and the update before the old Dubsmash u can use the same sound from that Dubsmash with having to type in the sound! Please change back to the way it was it was so much easier
3534,"""Kount""","May 1, 2016",1,Confusing I lived dubs ash it was easy to use and I could do what I needed to do. Now it's like another social media. I can't figure out how to to post it to any of my other accounts that are just trying to be something they are not. I recommend not getting this app it is hard and confusing.

3549,SaeedRahmatolahi,"March 30, 2016",2,The limit of time is not good This app is so funny but! The biggest problem is that there is just few seconds I think the limit of recording sound should be at least 2 minutes

3569,💕🙈KiKiKatastrophe🙈💕,"June 8, 2015",3,Love it but.. Maybe it's an issue with my phone but every other dubsmash I make it says I can't save it because access was denied. In my settings it's clearly set so that dubsmash has the access. So annoying.
3570,Cici-smexy__,"March 14, 2015",4,Instagram This is a great app I love it but we should be able to share on Instagram to . Instagram should be an option but other than that it's great .
3571,Lindaxrrh,"March 24, 2015",5,I love it! I can be my silly self I've posted several videos using this app to dat chick Linda on Instagram and I find the app to be hilarious. It's great for passing time lol.

3574,USA's favorite funky duck,"April 10, 2015",1,Dumbsmash I waited like 20 minutes for it to load and when it finally loaded the dumb thing just went of my screen and when I went into the AppStore it said open so I pressed and it didn't do anything at all I highly disagree against all the good comments because I myself didn't even get to try it! DO NOT GE THIS APP!!!!!

3581,IzzyIceRios,"February 13, 2015",3,Update/Fix Needed! This would honestly be a five star app if it didn't force close as often and also provided a larger library/variety of audio dubs. Force closes too much on iPhone!
3582,Nate38310,"March 7, 2015",4,Hilarious! This app has kept my family rolling in the floor  could use a little revision with uploading and the app will stall sometimes. Other than that its great!!

3585,queena all day,"October 13, 2018",2,Hate new version Why u change the screen like it was perfect before and u don’t have a chance to set up the camera when u about to do something. U need to switch it back before rates star going down
3586,@TheRealDajani,"October 14, 2018",1,"NEW VERSION most people who use dubsmash are instagram dancers. not everyone is famous for it, but relatively a lot are. including myself. the new update prevents us from being able to post the videos we need to post. the sizing is dreadfully tiny. tik tok will be getting used until the update is fixed ❤️"
3587,nya🤪💍❤️😍,"October 15, 2018",1,About new update It is horrible I don’t like it it makes me look fat😢. It has no filters to make me look good and worst of all u can’t see the bottom half of my body because I have to back up very far and the cam can’t see my Beautiful face so plz change it back on behalf of all Camden kids/teens.😁
3588,Niahgomez,"October 15, 2018",1,"Disgusting The new update is not good what so ever. It crops the videos naturally from when the camera starts, so now I can’t get a full body because of the way the camera crops it, not can I go into my old videos and see what I did because those videos are suddenly cropped to square size"
3589,Jadadya789073,"December 3, 2018",5,App is awful This app is the worst it won’t even let me make and account

3606,SOMEONE :0,"April 30, 2016",2,"Why the update?! I love dubsmash, but it's getting really hard to do that with this new update. I don't like the set up to watch your own dubs. It crashes when I try to listen to and then record a sound. Please change it back!!"

3629,anime_obsession3780,"September 1, 2015",3,Just one problem for me. Dubsmash says to make sure I have an active network and I do. It's not accepting it though when I make an account and it's really bothering me. Other than that is a good app.
3630,SarahTruemper,"April 25, 2015",5,Always makes me smile! This app should bring a smile to everyone's face! Makes me laugh every time!

3639,FearTheWeird,"June 19, 2015",4,The new update has a glitch Once it is done recording and want to do it over the sound quietly keeps going on a loop
3640,😋8291,"February 8, 2015",3,"Nice Idea, But... A fun little app when it works, but it's a crash monster. Good luck trying to make your own Dubsmash clip because it crashes about 95% of the time. It needs a ton of work and reprogramming. This is one unstable and temperamental app."

Please fix that.
3650,coltdharris,"May 13, 2016",1,"New update is GARBAGE Used to really enjoy using this app. However, the new ""update"" has trashed the app. EVERY time I try to use it, the app crashes before I can even save one lousy dub. I would give zero stars, since you can't even occasionally do what the app is supposed to do, but that's not an option."

3715,mani.fye,"December 10, 2017",3,Can’t save it to my dubs I really like dubsmash but it doesn’t allow me to save it private . It only allows me to share or save my dubs to camera roll which I do not like . Please fix it fast .

3789,Knooneé,"January 24, 2018",1,Can’t save to my dubs I think it’s absolutely positively stupid that we can still view our previously saved videos in “my dubs” but can’t add anymore? Add “my dubs” video saving back. Point blank PERIOD. No one has enough space for all the dubs we make in a day! It was just a complete trash move for the app.

4808,Detroit_Mike,"October 12, 2018",1,"Worst update of any app Worst Update ever. Sure Dubsmash wasn’t perfect before, but instead of making Dubsmash better, you eliminated everything that made Dubsmash great. Can’t create custom Dubsmashes, can’t save dubsmashes. You’ve literally destroyed the one of the best apps ever. So sad. So frustrated."
4809,@bluffmug,"November 17, 2018",1,One Star🚮 I want the old Dubsmash back! This one is confusing and not to mention whenever I save my videos my whole body is not shown. I’ve lost all of previous videos/memories and cannot get them back😪
4810,Raven W.,"June 23, 2016",1,"Crashes a lot Every time I try to save my dubs it will say ""creating video"" and then it would just close. I agree it was working well before. It works on my Samsung but when it comes to my iPod nothing, jacked! Please fix!"
4811,Amnesia1985,"June 27, 2016",1,"Hate it Back when dubsmash first came out it was the best app to have on your phone. Now it's terrible, they took away all the fun features and just made it a low budget snapchat!!!! Will be deleting ASAP! Waste of space if you ask me!"
4812,Jsleeth,"August 2, 2016",1,"Huge Loss :( This app was awesome before the updates that deleted ALL my saved Dubsmash videos.  SO bummed.  Lots of amazing  memories (even a bunch with my kids) that are now gone.  If there was a fix for that, and for them to be recovered, I'd be eternally grateful!  So sad.  So dissatisfied & disappointed:("

5311,Megbando,"November 23, 2016",1,"Old version is better I liked the old version better instead of the full length screen. If I were to upload a dub smash on Instagram, it wouldn't even show the logo."
5312,Allita_slimm,"December 22, 2016",5,Dubsmash I love this app I've been losing weight while dancing
5313,Kira_Queen Slay_😈💕😝😜,"July 27, 2017",5,Musicaly It's just like musically just additional effects.
5314,Damahri,"October 29, 2017",1,Help I’ve had Dubsmash for years now and this update is kind of confusing me. When I make a Dubsmash I don’t have the option anymore to save it to “my dubs” I only have options to share it. How can I save a Dubsmash to my dubs
5315,rnenene,"February 28, 2018",2,Trending I like the app in all but every time I go on trending it has the same things on there and it doesn’t change at all. Please fix that.
