0,Hix|,"April 30, 2020",4,"Update Ideas So i think the app is really good but i would just like to make a few requests like when you hold the button for a longer time the video zooms in. Another one could be like there are more filters like doggy, glitch, and other cooler filters. Also I think one of the updates should be that you can duet other people's dubs. Ohh and i think you guys should also let us pick how long we what the video to go until it pauses, do u guys get what i mean? And we should also be able to change the video voice, and pick how long we want the captions to show until. Thank you, sorry if i said to much, i would really appreciate if you made those changes. Again thank you. If you can, can u pls let the sounds go a bit longer than 20 seconds, it should go like to 1 minute at least. Also can you Please Please fix the block people thing and not have a limitation because I think there is a glitch and its not letting me block anybody, and I am getting frustrated can u plss make like a green screen thing, like there is a photo it the background, but its a greenscreen, and some new filters, like a doggy face, a which Disney princessnce are u, etc, it would mean a lot"
1,ilovebillieeyelash üòã,"April 13, 2020",1,"PARENTS PLEASE READ THIS! this app is a lot of fun! You can dance, and have a great time! But adults are also on this app..... so sexual predators are all over the children. You can use this app to text people (that you DONT know!) and it‚Äôs very scary to think that millions of kids that DO have this app are possibly being harassed by a predator. This app should be much much more organized and you NEED to make sure the kids on here are safe!!! People on this app, twerk, show inappropriate parts of there body on camera, use  sexual assault with comments, online date, do sexting, verbal abuse, and the kids who are the ‚Äúpretty ones‚Äù not only get wayyy to much attention from these sexual predators but so do the younger children that use this app! Children that have been sexually abused by predators usually don‚Äôt tell anyone because they don‚Äôt know how the person will react or if they will get in trouble. Especially for the children that are traumatized or are already traumatized. Don‚Äôt let this be your child, or your self. Nobody here that is a good mother or father would want this for there children! KEEP SOCIAL APPS AWAY FROM KIDS UNTILL YOU KNOW THEY ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE!"
2,May.034,"November 27, 2019",3,Read this!!!!!!! Hey i‚Äôm new to this app and i love it!!There ls just a few things i need to say. 1st off some things are inappropriate to see and yeah you know what i mean. If people post those stuff they should get kicked off immediately. Also no songs with cuss words to make it more kid friendly. It makes kids think it‚Äôs ok then they get in trouble from there parents for saying them. Also there should be different speeds to do with the songs like fast or slow. I think you should make a Dubsmash app for KIDS!!! it would be awesome. Parents would be way more comfortable with kids having this app and kid friendly songs like High School musical or just fun things but also have songs with no cuss words and are fun to do even with tweens and teens. The age limit should be 8-14. I would want that app way more. So please keep this in mind!!!! I really hope you use these ideas to improve this app and it be way more fun for kids!!
3,Razii03,"January 10, 2020",4,"Update and Fix It is a fun app that kills time and has helped me learn new dances and make connections with friends. Though it could use some updates because it's the same as it has been for years. Also I‚Äôm having trouble with the sounds, when I try to play a sound it either glitches or doesn‚Äôt work. Is there anyway you can fix it?"
4,nkhnlhnku,"December 1, 2019",5,Fix I love this app with all my life but this new update needs to go I love the format and how you can see the hidden dubs but now I can even put it on private it‚Äôs either I post or I have to save it and delete it which I highly dislike and also i can‚Äôt even save my own dubs and I don‚Äôt like the messaging thing I can‚Äôt see who like my post or anything so if this can be fixed that would be great if it went back to the old ways where we can save them to private or just save them and take all the extra stuff out would be great old way was much better only thing I like about this new update is that the private and the posted videos are separate please take this into consideration pleas and thank you
5,YeetDawwg,"February 17, 2020",5,i like the app but... the app is really good but could be better with improvments
6,khikhiüòÅüòÅüòò,"January 2, 2020",5,"To dubsmash creators Omg I love dubsmash so much and I use it almost everyday but since yesterday it started messing up I couldn‚Äôt watch videos,listen to sounds, or even post videos. I was so upset üòñ. So I tried again today and it didn‚Äôt work. So I tried to delete it and download it again but it isn‚Äôt downloading and i have enough space on my device for me to download dubsmash, but the main problem is that it isn‚Äôt letting me do my dances or watch others. But otherwise dubsmash is a wonderful dancing app I consider sending the link to your friends because I have put mine on dubsmash but yes please fix these bugs and glitches."
7,liberty. giana,"December 23, 2019",4,"Dubsmash is a magnificent app I love dubsmash but sometimes the music has a lot of cussing in it but it is a lit app for only 11 - 14 I like it so far sometimes the music is inappropriate for kids I think little kids like 6-8 should not be on the app but that is up to their parents so not trying to be in other people‚Äôs bissness so I like the app it is ok who ever created this app did ok with creating it for  11-14 again only for this is what I said only for 11-14 if you want to feel the experience go ahead and check it out for your self remember I am not trying to be in others peoples bissnes remember be the one to help others dubsmash be your own hero sincerely,liberty to dubsmash love your app"
8,Matt Matt LOL,"January 24, 2020",4,Slomo OK I don‚Äôt really write reviews because most of my games and other apps are good but the only thing bad about this is delete slow mode because most of the songs that people put in there is used to be slow oh yeah and if they should have fast mode to but I‚Äôm not really into that right now so yeah. Another thing you should block inappropriate text because in this app there‚Äôs lotta inappropriate stuff that I know little kids have it just saying because so almost everybody those little kids have it because of there big sisters and brothers so I‚Äôm just saying you should put some blocking of  putting a inappropriate words in there and tha is it
9,HUMBLE R,"January 9, 2020",5,"Dubsmash I have this app on my phone and two tablets and am on it basically everyday!! I enjoy the app a lot and one of the pluses is the Dubs are so clean compared to the lyrics in the sounds! But lately I have started to see an increase in inappropriate profile pics and an issue with reporting them! The last two times I had to report the profiles via reporting the bug about the reporting not working right! This is an important bug to fix, especially at a time when many apps are having to update their Terms and Conditions!!! Other then that this is one of my favorite apps right now!!"
10,maddielicioustx,"December 20, 2018",4,"Good but some things need to be changed I think Dub smash is amazing! But I think it should notify you if someone you have followed has made a dub and if someone follows you. And before the update there were so many inappropriate sounds made by dub smash I was like whaaaat?. I think you should also be able to chat with your friends on it.( but if y‚Äôall do that then make sure bad words are turned in to $,&,@,#etc) and just one more thing I think you should be able to make your dubs in fast or slow motion. Thanks for reading my review. Btw great app"
11,Gabbi.O,"January 5, 2019",5,"Dumbsmash Is Decent I really like the new update. It feels like an instagram page. It‚Äôd be better if we could comment on each other‚Äôs dubs instead of only liking and viewing. There should also be a way to repost saved dubsmashes. Like sometimes I‚Äôll make a dance and then save it to my camera roll, and decide that I‚Äôm going to redo it. But then I can‚Äôt post the camera roll ones because it would be gone. There should be an option to save them in like a folder after recorded for future posts. Besides that it‚Äôs a good app. üòé!"
12,rb4rings,"January 13, 2019",4,"Edited review I am very happy with the new changes Dubsmash made with being able to save to camera roll and being able to scroll through all dubs instead of watching them all to get to one. However, my new only issue is that we have to make videos public for our friends to see. I don‚Äôt really want to make my videos public, but how else can I show my other friends on dub? If you could bring back the old feature where friends can see your dubs or you can send dubs to friends without them being on public, that would be great."
13,t√∏p died,"February 25, 2019",2,Eh So I‚Äôve had the app before and it was a lot of fun to do like movie quotes or like Tik Tok memes and vines. I liked the way the feed was with the videos of the actual show on my feed like it would say ‚Äúcardi b‚Äôs awesome moments ‚Äú and then it would show vids of her saying the quotes u could dub. No offense but now it‚Äôs trashed with ten year olds dubbing to songs about twerking and drugs and a whole bunch of people trying to dance to rap songs and tryna be gang members. Pls fix it and put the feed back up like how it was. I don‚Äôt care if the people still dance to the rap songs I just don‚Äôt wanna see it- thanks tbh I low key hate the app now. Not tryna be rude but it‚Äôs basically the worst app ever it worse than Tik Tok it‚Äôs ten year old kids twerking to songs about sex
14,gkjkdrhh,"March 31, 2019",5,My account back Look I really like the app but I forgot my password my account name was omgthats_fatfat and I have 5 followers please just tell me my password I know that it was in responsible of me to forget my password like that but please get me into my account I‚Äôm begging you please please please tell me my password or get me back into my account and again my account name is omgthats_fatfat I‚Äôm a good kid I‚Äôm 14 have a kid please get me back into my account or tell me my password          
15,Honest889üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª,"September 25, 2019",4,"Pretty good, but a few suggestions. Dubsmash is a really awesome app and I enjoy making videos on it. Regardless, I think there could be some improvements. I prefer dubsmash as an app to tiktok but I think Dubsmash should update the recording format like TikTok. I think there should be a recording speed because some of the dances on the app are fun but very fast. As well as a timer for where to stop recording. As well as the ability to add photos/videos from the camera roll. One more thing, I wish you could have an option for a private account so only certain people can follow you. That would be great !Thanks for reading my suggestions!"
16,Hard and Fun!!!,"August 12, 2019",4,"Great BUT: Ok i love dubsmash its so fun! In some cases some of the content is a little inappropriate, but i just steer away from that. WHAT I WISH is that you can have and option for certain speeds, like a slow mo vid or a fast vid, or you can do slow regular and fast all in one vidio. Also, i wish you can type ceartin things for cearthing segmints, like one segment it can be: HI! And the next it can be: My name is _____ . I think that would make the app way more fun. Also, mAybe you can have it so you can add effects, and different filters for a segmant. I would like it if we can see the filters while we film too. Other than that, this is a great app!"
17,_Ava_D,"March 6, 2020",4,"Fun App This app is so fun. I like the new update where you can change the speed it‚Äôs recording at. One thing I think would make the app better is if you could set a time in the middle of the sound for it to stop recording without you having to press the button. Also could you maybe make a feature where you have to accept somebody for them to be able to send you messages? I know that you have to have them follow you and you follow them back for someone to be able to message you, but I would still like a feature like that. Well overall this is a really great and fun app!! üòÅüëç"
18,Zhana√©,"March 13, 2020",4,"The app is fyeeüî•,but...... I love dubsmash so much. It allows you to express yourself and be you. It lets you step out of reality and be creative. Although, if you forget your password it doesn‚Äôt send a link to your gmail. I have a new account but I would like to delete my old videos from my other account. But I can‚Äôt do so because of the link. I‚Äôve tried multiple times to reset the link but it won‚Äôt send anything. I even tried to re-download the app and it‚Äôs not working. I hope that you could find a resolution to my problem."
19,slomo vid take down,"May 1, 2020",3,Mmm no . honestlyy i loved dubsmash for the longest but now they took the most popular filter out and added these ugly ones . and now it takes FOREVER for a video to save . i made a video and its still downloading and i can not watch it until its done and i already deleted it from my camera roll sooo.. and i hate the fact that it saves to your camera roll i wish they gave you a choice if we want it saved to your camera roll cause my dad can see my stuff anddd wheww please fix it !!! and the app kinda slow ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. but other that that its a really cool app like dubsmash the original .
20,Mlg3137,"December 8, 2018",3,"Come on guys, keep it coming! This app is awesome!! But I think part of the reason why people have forgotten about it is because it hasn‚Äôt progressed or evolved. Lately it‚Äôs been having so much trouble. It‚Äôd be great to have a little more control on the things we can create. 10 seconds is never enough for some funny scenes. And the search tool could also be so much better. Like someone was saying, separate users from actual sounds. "
21,amyzzk,"January 13, 2019",2,"Not Enough Movie / TV Quotes I love this app, but it seems that it caters more towards the dancers with all the music. I miss the old dubsmash where you had tons and tons of movie/ tv show/ celebrity quotes instead, I feel like it‚Äôs highly lacking in this section. I really really miss the variety of categories as well, as options for us to scroll through instead of having to search (like specifically a chick flick category, reality tv category, etc) The search is nice to have but I remember the old dubsmash from two years ago was much more thorough and had more variety. PLS bring back more non-music!"
22,fleekgirl123,"January 30, 2019",4,We need friends plsssssss‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è For the most part Dubsmash is really nice I use Dubsmash a lot and they have a variety of songs and dances but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the only one with this problem but I can‚Äôt seem to find my friends the old Dubsmash before the update I could find my friends and search for them but now I can‚Äôt find the friends I had before and I can‚Äôt search for friends and when I checked the help thing in the app it said it was still in progress so I‚Äôm confused ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è on why we can‚Äôt find friends üë≠
23,slayy_rhi,"July 12, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs GOOD BUT HAS BAD MOMENTS I love the app . I get to express myself with others of my dancing I love dancing and real people actually see it and like my post one this app it is amazing but right now there‚Äôs this update where you can‚Äôt save your videos anymore and I love to just have my videos in my camera roll to myself I know your can save it privately on your page . But I just can show my videos to people easier and post it on other social medias and express my dancing on there . No hate or anything , but would love if Dubsmash would add back saving videos to your camera roll . "
24,üíúüíüSymphoneyüíüüíú,"December 26, 2019",3,Never savesüôÅ and now isn‚Äôt working Dubsmash is a awesome app we‚Äôre your able to socialize and dance.üòä but although if you are trying to make a Dubsmash and you didn‚Äôt finish and you go back later the Dubsmash Doesn‚Äôt save and you haft to start over againüò≠! Please fix this problem!!! I also have told some of my friends that Dubsmash isn‚Äôt working and that the videos won‚Äôt pop up... and they all said that it isn‚Äôt working for them either I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong but this needs to stop if I‚Äôm gonna keep making Dubsmash‚Äôs! Fix this problem!!üòí
25,rickiyaa,"July 11, 2019",5,"too short i love dubsmash its just the audio amount is to short I think it should be longer or be able to make the audio longer cuz when people are making challenge the audio amount is to short && you can‚Äôt do the challenge cuz it probably be like 15 seconds && it only can be 10 , you should make it longer cuz people are starting to use funimate cuz of how long you can make your videos && challenges .."
26,lelethegamer1383,"October 25, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs good but has flaws So I had Dubsmash for a long time since I was in 6th grade and so I wanted to post my old videos on my instagram. So I went back to see them but I noticed that most of them was deleted. I was confused because I seen them on there like a month ago but now there gone and I know for a fact I didn‚Äôt delete them so who did.?? But over all Dubsmash is a fun app but they need to fix that because I‚Äôm angry and annoyed that, that even happened and I know for the next person that might  experience that there going to be mad too sooo..... STOP DELETING STUFF!!"
27,Lea Simone,"November 2, 2019",1,Why just why I‚Äôve had this app for many year and not once have it ever deleted every single Dubsmash I made I don‚Äôt have non of my old ones that‚Äôs bad and that‚Äôs makes me not even wanna use the app if it‚Äôs just gonna get deleted I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a new thing I lost what was mine and I want it back I can‚Äôt remake those and I like watching them and when I went to the app today they were gone and I know al you gonna say is ok we understand and we gonna fix it but this is a real issue you might have to down grade the app so I can get my stuff back or something this is your fault it was there 2 days ago and now it‚Äôs not shame on you  I just want it back
28,complaintpolice,"October 27, 2019",1,"What is this?? I‚Äôm not liking the new dubsmash. I say this because they took the option of the private post off of it and now when you make videos you have to post them publicly so everybody can. This is an issue for me because I make silly dubs and I don‚Äôt want people to see them AT ALL. I would like to post my dubs privately and also keep them in dubsmash so eventually I can save my old dubs for memories, but when my dubsmash updated all my dubs from 2016 til now were GONE!! The only videos that were on my dubsmash account were the ones I made a mistake and posted them publicly that way. I‚Äôm just asking can y‚Äôall please put the privacy option back on dubsmash"
29,Kayla_theslayer,"July 18, 2019",5,"Post from Camera roll Hi I have a request for dub smash ,to me I think that dubsmash should have something that let you post from your camera roll because sometimes people like edit their videos before they post it but on dubsmash you can only change the filter and write something on the post and stuff like that so can we please have something that let us post from our camera roll"
30,jazlynne_alondra,"June 8, 2019",3,"Issues on Views & Likes üëÄ‚ù§Ô∏è I have a problem with the views and likes on my account they have been different from my activity such as if I get a like on a video I don‚Äôt see on my profile I could only see the numbers on my profile the next day and i still get the notifications from my activity but i still don‚Äôt see it on my profile so I would appreciate if you could fix it. Also, add a bio so people can express themselves more apart from just the captions and comments."
31,golden._.princesa,"July 22, 2019",3,"Look at this ! Dubsmash is a great app don‚Äôt get me wrong ! But when it has it‚Äôs downfalls they are horrible . When the videos constantly load & you can‚Äôt even load a sound . I have to delete the app then download it back just for it to work properly,,, & I‚Äôm tired of it !!!!! Also , sometimes when you are filming a video the blue will stop & not load the video . That also makes me have to download it back ,, which is a lot of work ! That is very aggravating ! ,,, but other than that the app is amazing . Y‚Äôall should add dm‚Äôs though ."
32,Jordin10411,"April 14, 2020",3,"Updates to Dubsmash I believe that Dubsmash is a good app I just think that Dubsmash should be a little bit more like Instagram or Snapchat, I believe that on Dubsmash we should be able to have a story, I believe we should have filters like the Snapchat filter and I believe that we should have a bio but for now dubsmash is a boring app I think it will be better with these changes I have stated thank you for reading my changes to Dubsmash that both you and I know should be made. We should also be able to make boomerangs and go live once we hit 1k"
33,ililna,"January 4, 2020",5,I love Dubsmash I love Dubsmash because it do not show your home in where u live like tiktok so no one can come in take u form ur home when ur mom is gone in Dubsmash is also special to me because u don‚Äôt know that ur friends have Dubsmash but when u follow them on Dubsmash in watch they video in realize in say that‚Äôs my friend in u say I‚Äôm finna call her in tell her that u follow her on Dubsmash in she be like what‚Äôs yo name in she say London_hot in she go follow u back in that‚Äôs why I like Dubsmash
34,skjsveyejsbkdsbwvejodnwvs,"February 12, 2020",5,Have one problem The app is great but on the explore page with the new update i think it would be better to actually explore and not just click on one video then you are on watching them on the explore page. Also When I get likes it doesn‚Äôt reload all the way it takes a couple days sometimes. Other than that this is a great app
35,Hallaween nessa,"December 8, 2019",2,"This app is glitchy This app is amazing! But one complaint I have is that I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Dubsmash or my phone, but Dubsmash will not let me look at most videos because they‚Äôre loading. It‚Äôs not my WiFi, and it will never completely load it stays like that for a very long time, and never changes, Also, when I make videos, the purple line, that indicates it is recording, will stop in the middle of a dance, then goes away, making it impossible to upload a video!!! It is really frustrating and I hope there is something that can fix this error!"
36,jsksnsndn,"April 13, 2020",3,Love it I love this app it‚Äôs very creative but I wish there were a little more updates. 1st is to go live. I wish we could go live when we get it least 1000 followers . 2nd I wish you can upload a video that u saved but then press the same sound under instead of it saying original sound. 3rd I wish it lets u send up to 3 messages to the follower if u don‚Äôt get a follow back. I really love the app but wish these updates could happen. I really wish 1 was true. Thanks for your service
37,GamesAholic22,"September 7, 2019",1,"Why? I deleted Dubsmash a while ago and redownloaded it. When I went to creat an account and I put in my email. When I did it said I already had an account so I went to log in put in my email again and put in my password that I thought was correct. It said it was incorrect I said ‚ÄúOkay, it‚Äôs been a while I‚Äôll just have it send an email.‚Äù So I did. It never sent I said resend but nothing happened. I think it should be able to send a text or something or if you already have an account it can say login or creat new account. I hoped you liked my suggestion and please take it into consideration."
38,cjbarri,"March 29, 2020",4,"Wont Save My Videos Ive used Dubsmash since 2017! Ive always been able to save my vids! Until the app update the save button will spin and it will say ""video saved"" but i wont show up in my camera roll! It is very important that i get my dubs out to my other platforms!! Other than that i love the app!! But if this continues i will be forced to switch app most likely Tiktok nd thats not something mostly because ive been on dubsmash the longestüôÅ!"
39,nelly._thebomb,"October 20, 2019",5,Love the app but I love this app but I do request some things I wish u could have sum like dm‚Äôs so u can talk to people and I wish you could change the color of the type on a video. Also if you could have more then one account on you dub so it would be a thing where u would see all the passwords you have.

40,queen jayy üëë,"March 3, 2019",4,"Can you guys save all our likes videos Can you guys make like an area for liked dubs, Because when we like a video we want to rewatch it but we have to go to that persons profile to see it again. You guys should make a specific spot in Dubsmash where you have all the videos that you liked so that you can rewatch them. But I love Thai app and that‚Äôs the only reason i didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars."
41,braceface_nyny,"April 21, 2019",5,Finding friends This app is a good app but we need to follow friends . Like put the contacts back on there so we can follow people on this app . It don‚Äôt have to be the same old way but add the contacts so we can see our friends dance and we can follow them .also emojis let say if we make a twerk video can we cover our but up so nobody can‚Äôt see it???
42,Ambii Tunes,"May 29, 2019",5,Favorites I really love Dubsmash but can you please make it back to when you could do videos to any sound in your favorites when you don‚Äôt have an internet connection? I don‚Äôt have data and I get really bored sometimes. I go to Dubsmash when I‚Äôm bored but now that we can‚Äôt do anything without WiFi I just sit there bored. So please let us have that one advantage.
43,nessaaaa.wessaaaaa,"October 14, 2019",4,AMAZING BUTü§£ Dubsmash was the best app I‚Äôve ever downloaded! Buhh at the same time it can sometimes get me heated ü§¨ like I will get notifications late.. or it will freeze up on me even when I‚Äôm using wifiü•∂ I think we should have a communication area and also lives.. for people over 1K fans. Everyone should get the ability to communicate with fans buhh not have to get there numbers or go on live sooo fans can see the real us! Juss a suggestion!
44,4ever jay,"June 29, 2019",5,Better than Tik Tok On Tik Tok when u try to choose a sound it searches something else but in Dubsmash when u search a sound it will search exactly what you want but the only thing I wish Dubsmashhad was that if u saved your videos and wanted to post them there should be a upload button where y can tap and choose your Dubsmash to upload
45,Kamrin10,"September 2, 2019",4,Good but... Dubsmash is a really good app . Since I‚Äôm not aloud to have Instagram I like it because it‚Äôs just like it sort of . I wish we could be able to Dm people and be able to upload other dubsmashes  from your camera roll to your profile instead of having to make the Dubsmash and then upload it . But other than that Dubsmash is great and I really like it . I don‚Äôt have much followers but it‚Äôs still awesome !
46,Ky_Ky-,"November 6, 2019",4,an issue I love the dubsmash app I have been using it for a long time now. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to post a video that I recorded immediately so I save it to private and post it later. With this recent update if I save it to my privates (saved videos) then it does not give me the option to go back and post the video that was saved. This is a major problem that needs to be fixed. Please and Thankyou.
47,glowngvessel,"March 2, 2020",4,"Needs some updates Hello! So I have a couple ideas that could be put in the app! I feel like there should be a zoom feature. I would love a zoom feature! Also at least an option to were the videos could be a minute long! It is really hard to squeeze a lot into a video with only 20 seconds. I hope these thoughts could be incorporated into the app! Thanks, buh bye!"
48,mkkkskkskss,"January 6, 2020",4,"The likes! I would give this app a five but every time I refresh my page more than once just to make sure my likes went up it takes my likes down.

One HAD 2 likes and the other HAD 1 like but then when I refreshed it the 2nd time that video that got 1 like now has 0 and the one that had 2 likes now has 1 like."

51,Jmanishere,"February 10, 2019",1,Wow I don‚Äôt leave a ton of reviews.. but I recently downloaded this again after remembering how fun it was to do movie quotes and fun songs... my surprise that it has become something like back to the future 2. It‚Äôs basically a twitter feed of cardi b people twerking. Gotta say I‚Äôm scared for the future of the world. I don‚Äôt care to see what everyone is doing so don‚Äôt need it slammed down my eyes. I‚Äôm definitely not favoring any teen twerking to some rap song or type of music I don‚Äôt even get. Put a normal search system like you had before. It‚Äôs literally the worst. Deleting again..
52,ciarra2905,"March 26, 2019",3,Need more dub songs ü•¥ Hello dubsmash! I have been using dubsmash for a couple of years and i am really pleased with the overall idea of the app and how it functions but there is one little problem and that is that on the treading and new music pages they always have the exact same song multiple times and when I want to find new dub songs I can‚Äôt because of the lack of variety on those pages.
53,Hay yall!,"March 30, 2019",2,"TikTok is better TikTok is way better than this. There isn‚Äôt as many songs and you can‚Äôt so slowmotions. Also, there isn‚Äôt that much song choices and nobody that I‚Äôm following on TikTok is on this app, so what am I supposed to do? What‚Äôs the main thingy called? Not the For You Page like TikTok. This app is only good if you don‚Äôt have any experience of lip sync or something. On the bright side, I am definitely the new transition queen because I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who knows how to do it. Ok bye now"
54,Drxp Succ,"May 25, 2019",3,"Too many Glitches It‚Äôs a great app to lip sync and dance too but the amount of glitches and updates makes everything worse. I can make a video and it‚Äôll process forever. Not only that but whenever I try to get back into the app maybe after calling somebody it will take a long time to get back to what I‚Äôm doing. It‚Äôs slow and hard to work with but it‚Äôs fun. I‚Äôll give it 5 stars if it fixes the glitches. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great app no cap!"

58,nightly92,"January 3, 2020",1,Love hate relationship I used to love this app but now i cannot get into my account on my new phone. I tried to request the reset link but it never arrives in my inbox or junk mail. I tried to message the team in twitter and through email but no one responds. It shows my account is still active when i try to create a new account too. So that is not the issue either. I also tried other emails to test if it was just my email not working but it tells you when other emails have an account or not. Im just stuck.
59,ms piggy loverüíãüíãüíã,"October 12, 2019",4,Sorry The reason I gave it a 4 is because of the sounds and videos people make on dubs ash I love making videos but the things in the app aren't the best even for 12 year olds it isn't appropriate so all you have to do is fix that. Also something that made me a little upset was i couldn't make my account private or put on the people I want to see it.
60,Hay_itz_Jay,"February 22, 2019",4,"One suggestion... This app is amazing! I left tik tok for dubsmash and I‚Äôm glad I did! I have one suggestion though. I think there should be a separate section for private videos so that I can‚Äôt get lost to what videos are private, and what videos are public. Overall this app is amazing and I definitely recommend! Oh yeah, and please try to respond back :)"
61,_the.best,"November 22, 2019",5,Dubsmash is great I think that you should be able to do slow motion as well as fast. Also I think it would be a good idea if you could go live on dubsmash!! Another thing that would make the app better is if you could zoom in and marybe have like different face filters!!! Thanks !!
62,maya_gotmoves,"September 14, 2019",5,Let us post vids from our camera roll I love this app like I have 1.8k followers and I can just be myself when dancing.I was wondering if y‚Äôall can add this part when we can post things from our camera roll it will help the app a lot and will truly make it better.(in my opinion)

65,baddie_blueüíô,"November 30, 2019",4,"Awesome. 1 fix Hey, I like Dubsmash and I thinks it‚Äôs a amazing app! One thing you need to fix is when people with certain androids post a video people with iPhones go on there video and all of a sudden like there video stops in the middle of the video! I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs only if a iPhone user watches a andriod user video but I think that‚Äôs so annoying so can you plz fix that thanks üòÜ"

67,buttonhirl23,"September 22, 2019",5,Suggestions Dubsmash if your reading this is saying you should add the different time things like slow and fast that would make it even better and also if you could stop it with little time periods but other then that this app is great!
68,best app reviewr,"January 12, 2020",5,Love but... I love Dubsmash I just think we should have a story like Instagram so u don‚Äôt have to post on ur main but u can post on ur story and Dubsmash should have a feature when u can add another account up idk 5 but yea make it like a real hit like if y‚Äôall can do that i would REALLY love the app as much as I do now
69,h√§dl√´√ø,"April 22, 2020",4,"Good but needs improvement. Great app but improvements. First, it‚Äôs a fun app just I would like if there was weird face filters to make it funnier. Second, if there is something inappropriate, banned them from the app. This should be a kids app. Also, there should be a zoom when you are recording. Other  than that, it‚Äôs a great app!"
70,Tijianalove,"December 26, 2018",3,"Not as it use to be The videos load SLOW! Also, it won‚Äôt let me record as much videos as I want.

74,niyeupnext,"May 19, 2019",4,Dubsmash delivery After all Dubsmash is a really developed app it‚Äôs been getting better over time .

222,No. 20 Entertainment,"June 22, 2019",1,bad for kids!!! I got this app when I was 6 or 5 and nothing bad happened with it. but now I decided to download it 8 years later bc all that me and my sister used it for when we were younger was to make funny videos but no having you to be 14 and having all songs be bad? Like is this just a inappropriate app bc that‚Äôs what it should be called not appropriate for kids at all!
223,nyijrai allen megad 12,"April 26, 2020",5,Suggestion I personally think you guys should add an update where we can search for a sound in our favorites !!
224,hehshdfj,"January 25, 2020",5,Suggestion This is just an suggestion but it would be cool if we could go live on dubsmash so we can talk to our fans and things like that but overall the app is cool.
225,Dmoneyy987,"January 16, 2020",4,Dubsmash one of my favorite social media apps Great app I think it just needs some special effects to make it waaay cooler. And I love the new update so you can message people and the Notification Center is in the top right hand corner.

227,yeboi27,"June 11, 2019",1,"Trash I used the app years ago and it was the best thing ever but now if you want to find anything other than music that‚Äôs actually funny it‚Äôs impossible, if the app made funny clips easily accessible then maybe the trending tab wouldn‚Äôt be so full of music (which is why I don‚Äôt use the app anymore) oh and half my saved sound clips are inaccessible for whatever reason"

232,DrBDDS,"January 17, 2020",3,Love the app- but when you save the videos the audio video don‚Äôt match Exporting dub videos don‚Äôt sync properly.

The first time I was sooooo disappointed and lost so many things I really wanted. Now I know to back them up but it‚Äôs a pain. I wish I would have known this and you definitely should put a warning before people update."

I can finally find hilarious one liners or bits from songs and make stupid and funny short clips and share them with really whoever I want. My friends and family do goofy ones back and it is seriously he highlight of my day just to get a solid laugh here or there. They even make it so you can upload some of your own recordings and make a dubsmash of that. The iPhone doesn't let you have music on it and use the camcorder at the same time, and this all basically solves that while also making it easy to save all the dubsmash videos you've done."
1661,JRR1020,"June 30, 2016",5,"My all-time favorite unnecessary app! Plain and simply put, when it comes to sheer entertainment value and having a laugh among friends, Dubsmash is my favorite app. The novelty never really gets old whether you're lip-syncing to a song or lip-syncing a famous line from your favorite movie, this app stays fresh. I've tried other apps to try and find more options to waste away lazy afternoons, but they ultimately waste space and grow stale (Trivia Crack, I'm looking at you). Yes it's true, there are a lot of bugs and crashes with the latest version, but that's going to happen when you start taking an app that is initially designed for sharing among the Facebook community, and you start making it into an app that has its own friend list and its own mini social network built into it. Six months ago you pretty much had to have a Facebook account to use this app but today you could have a standalone Dubsmash account if you didn't want Facebook to be the final destination for your creation. To me, a big indicator of an app's ability to contend and to stand on its own two feet, is its ability to be fully functional on its own, without insisting users have a Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or Google+ account linked to the app for it to function properly. I have confidence Dubsmash will work out the bugs which is why I give this incredibly entertaining app a full 5‚≠êÔ∏è!"

1670,Maelody1234,"May 8, 2015",4,"I'll come back to give a fifth star if... I LOVE this app so much! I have tons of fun and I can spend hours on it! However having so much fun ends up being pointless if there's no feed for the videos other than Facebook or other social network sites because not all of my personal friends want to see tons of videos of me being silly! I know there's a separate app for the feed that you actually have to pay for to download your own videos which is ridiculous because lately it has a load of bad reviews which makes me hesitant to even download it. having two separate apps for one thing is also ridiculous. Other than that I would really like to see the option to do split videos so we can act out scenes better instead of just in want to go. It's all mostly a great app and I love it, just fix these things and I'll love it even more!"
1671,Fallengrace4,"May 16, 2015",5,"Omg...hours of fun! Love it. I'm not one to write reviews, I think this is maybe the third or fourth review I've written thus far. Normally I give the stars, and that's it, lol. However I felt the need to give Dubsmash a big thumbs up. It's so much fun, you can add your own sounds or use one submitted by other users. I can see this becoming a very popular app, like it's not already, and hope to see new features added as it grows. I just hope it won't be one of those apps that after it blows up, they change everything good about it, lol. It's solid the way it is. Would be nice to have more options in the edit section, like maybe the possibility of user created content. Overall I highly recommend this app. It's very entertaining, easy to use, and the end results will get plenty of laughs from anyone you share it with. I also suggest this app to friends and family. "
1672,Kenman79,"November 26, 2015",5,"To Support 5 star because this app has brought out the creativity in me that has helped me make many new friends. Dubsmash is so much more than an app. It's a lifestyle! Super addicting, but in a good way and it's free. IG is the place to be with your dubs. "
1673,Zelig2u,"February 22, 2016",4,"So fun! So, there are a couple of negatives, but man is this app fun...and addictive!  The 2 negatives are: 1) The way it's organized isn't perfect. For example, there are tons of folders that have nothing in them. It would be nice if some kind of icon alerted you to that & you wouldn't waste your time looking in it.  Also, doing a search one way often will not return a result, but will another way. For example, you look for a song by a certain artist & you find it by the artist, but not the song title, or vice-versa.  It would be great if when posting something, the person posting could tag it with key words, not necessarily that show, but that are used for searching for it.  It would speed up the search process enormously!! 2) The app occasionally freezes...probably because I'm workin' it so hard!  All that being said, it's still an absolute blast and you WILL have fun!!"
1674,Oneminuteplease,"June 18, 2016",1,"Newset update is extremely slow The Dubsmash app was working fine on my phone until I downloaded themost recent update. Ever since then Dubsmash has slowed to an almost unusable crawl. The audio clip previews take a good while to load, whereas before the loaded pretty much instantly. Switching from one menu option to another is a crap shoot. Sometimes tapping works, other times it won't (but even if it does respond, there's always a delay, unlike before the update). Scrolling through my videos also has issues. Besides taking a bit to start playing, they tend to freeze up and won't let me scroll to another video until the current one finishes playing at least once through (with no way to pause). Ans because of the slowness and response delays, any Dubsmash I record since the update comes out choppy and out of sync no matter what. I generally enjoy Dubsmash, but this particular version of the app is a mess. How it made it's way to the app store in it's current state is a little baffling. I hope these issues get fixed relatively soon, because I would really would like to continue making Dubsmashes."
1675,racewalk101,"July 21, 2016",2,Older is better The original dubsmash was great and then you went and made it better and I thought 'oh this is perfect all the updates must be great!!!' Well I was so wrong... In the last update the whole thing got screwed up!! Now you have to save to moments or share it or else you can't finish making the dub. Sometimes I want some private dubs not ones for my friends to see. And another big thing they have to to fix is they have to make is on the update they made it so you can't share dubs on messages or anything. Now you have to save to camera roll and then share it. What if I don't want it on my camera roll!!! All I am saying it that completely ruined dubsmash and they have to make it back to how it used to be... Plus it deleted like 100 of my dubs and some of them were my fav dubs so you also have to fix that problem. I used to have over 350 dubs (I know that's a lot) but now I only have 220. You have ruined dubsmash forever and you have to fix it to get people to stop deleting it cause you are losing users by the day and if you don't do something soon I will be another user you lost.
1676,th√£tkidd√∏√∏.saharaa,"October 10, 2018",1,"I really hate the new update Everything was fine the way dubsmash recently was because the cool thing about it was that we could send our dubs to our friends and save them to ‚ÄúMy Dubs‚Äù. I also don‚Äôt like that the new update the dubsmash has to fit inside of a tiny square when dubsmash is the main thing that people use for Instagram dancing and stuff, but with the new update you can really see you whole body in the camera it cuts off your legs which is very disappointing. Can you please bring the old dubsmash back because she only cool things about the new update has to be that we can actually see the dub through a video which isn‚Äôt really that cool but it‚Äôs okay. Since I updated I can‚Äôt see the dubsmash videos that my cousin has been sending me and I can‚Äôt send anything to her because I have the new update. You need to fix this Dubsmash because no one asked for this app abuse, it makes a ton of people sad to see that something that we love has been completely corrupted."
1677,jacey725,"October 16, 2018",1,"MUST READ VERY IMPORTANT!! So let me explain.. I‚Äôve had this game for years and I loved it there was so much to do. I could change the color of the camera, I could stop the video in the middle, I could send stuff to my contacts, I could save all my stuff, I could change the voice tone, all kinds of stuff. Now there is all types of inappropriate things on the meme part (the new big mouth cartoon) and I can‚Äôt do all the stuff i could before. this was one of the was to text and talk to all my cousins and friends and now I can‚Äôt do that. I would like to say I‚Äôm very disappointed in this new update üòêüòêüòû‚òπÔ∏è(this is an edit) So I was on Dubsmash today and was very disappointed and angry with all of the new memes on there a lot of them are talking about inappropriate things!! I think that we should go back to the old update because what if someone has a really young child who plays on this app?? The inappropriate stuff would be very bad for them and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to play the app anymore!.... I personally think that you guys are loosing a lot of people who use to love this app!! Please go back to before it was way better!!!! Thank you for reading my review!"
1678,American Donuts,"October 23, 2018",1,"The new version is... okay. The new version is fine, it's just frustrating how you can't search for sounds that don't have videos for them or that you've already favorited. Something like that. It'll show stuff that doesn't have a video or isn't uploaded by y'all that I haven't favorited for OTHER stuff, but when I search up sounds I KNOW exist, it says there's no results. I want the old search back. NOW. "

I also appreciate the fact that your still trying to improve and update your app, that shows great effort. But!!!! Your update is not my cup of tea. The best part of your app is sending these dubs to friends and family while you have great convo over dubs. Now, don‚Äôt let this discourage you! Remember Snapchat‚Äôs crappy update? They went through a rough patch just like you are. But it‚Äôs not too late for change!!!! Now please if you love your dubers then you will reverse this update (and if possible give our convos back cause that was some golden stuff). But mainly pls let me send dubs and have priv convos w my friends again!!!!!!!! Once again I love you and appreciate you! Sry this is a comment I had no clue how else to tell you this.

In my personal opinion i love it

PERFECT! this app is perfect for sleepovers or even when you are at someone's house or they're over at your house! you have to be 13 or older, which I think is good because there is some bad ones that have bad things in them, like cussing. i think if you're 13 or older you should be aloud to have it. if you're younger than 13 then you should NOT be allowed!! like some people get on it that's 10 years old and they change their birthdate to 1995 or 1998. and they was born in like 2004. In my opinion they should get in trouble! I think any kid that does that should get in trouble because some apps days like ""confirm if you're 18 or older"" and they click ""yes, I am 18 or older"" they should get in trouble because maybe the app is bad.

Please add a way for people to rate their clip like a movie, add a kid friendly category, OR kid version app. The kids love this app too.

If your a kid and your parents don't let you have musically this is just like it except it does not let other people see you unless you decide to post it some where else. And even if your not a kid you can have so much fun with it too. But some dubs that other people load up have bad words in them. But don't worry you can report them. And get them band I think. It is not the apps fault that there are bad words it the people that post it. And if they post a song that says like one bad word in it like in the song Focus by Ariana grande just let it go.

1685,≈Åoving_≈Çife,"March 28, 2016",2,It's Great But It Needs An Update ASAP! I love this app because it allows me and friends to do funny bits and dances together. The only few problems I have that I think take a toll on the rating is that 1.) When I go to view all the dubs that I have done there is a black line at the top of all of them and that if you keep playing them the line will go down. 2.) Also when I go to view my dubs sometimes it rewinds my whole video to the end and I have to go to another dub then go back and wait for it to get to the end in order for me to see the whole video. 3.) If I open the app it will sometimes take me out of the app and I have to clear it from my history and then go back into it in order for it to work properly. If these issues are fixed this could be a five star rating. But with those issues it's the reason why I give it a two star. Please fix this soon.

Like I never made a dub before. It is very heartbreaking, because I had great moments in there.

I know you can report bad sounds, but even this takes too long.

By putting it on private or post you would either be able to see it or not. Also you should be able to follow people. Then you can like there videos. Because no one gets to see your videos only you.

The app gave me the option of logging in through Facebook, so I did. But then it said my email was already set up with the app, and asked if i should log in that way. I attempted a few times, to no avail. I clicked the ‚ÄúForgot password ‚Äú option to reset it, only to be told that dub smash had no record of my email address being set up with an existing account.

1696,honeybadgerh,"October 6, 2018",5,Best app ever! Video memes creation!! I‚Äôm using the new version and am loving it! The video clips are on point and I love being able to create my own memes. The video clips makes dubbing wayyy more fun in my opinion because they inspire you create more than just the sound did. Also I‚Äôm not an overly creative person so I like being able to dub exactly what the video characters are doing. 
1697,Unique M. Jones,"October 11, 2018",1,"Take the new UPDATE OFF!! I don‚Äôt like the new update and I‚Äôm pretty sure a lot of teens don‚Äôt either, which means your ratings will kinda go down (because almost everyone that uses this app is teens). I feel like you should take the new update down and go back to how it was before. Because you have this new update a lot of people will going to be TikTok to make videos. And I can also say this for me and a lot of other people that the update was pointless, dubsmash was perfect the way it was. I‚Äôm not trying to bash you guys but I would just like it if you would take the update down and put it back to it use to be, I will not be using dubsmash until the update is off and it is back to how it use to. Hope you guys get my review and understand what I‚Äôm trying to say and reply or at least try. üòö"
1698,DayblueStar,"October 12, 2018",3,"Please just make up your mind... I've had this app since around the end of 2016 and I've had a lot of fun with it. But... why does the app change its functions and looks so much? I'm constantly confused whenever I come back to a new update. As soon as I get used to one version, an new version of the app is introduced! Some good things added some places, some good things subtracted. I do like the idea of having a community based around the app, it seems a lot less lonely that way, but the good things about the past versions keep disappearing and causing confusion. I would ask that Dubsmash would please, please, make up your mind about what you want this app to be. Thank you."
1699,peyton_thedancer,"October 18, 2018",2,"Ehh This app was great before the update, everything was perfect and easy to navigate and create, this new update cuts off your face and half the screen when u save it, which makes it very difficult to manage.. especially since this app is mostly used for dancing not just memes so it shouldn‚Äôt be so up close. Also I think they should bring filters back!! It made the app a lot more fun and have more personality, a lot video recording apps don‚Äôt have that option, I don‚Äôt mind the new way to navigate the app I think it‚Äôs good, but the recording changes is just making this app turn for the worst, and soon if not already many will start deleting the app. Once these changes are made I will use the app again until then.... what‚Äôs the point?"
1700,Katmarie81586,"February 24, 2015",5,"The BEST thing to happen to me in a while I've always had an obsession with movies and movie quotes and the majority of my vocabulary comes from finding ways to squeeze obscure references and quotes into everyday life. This app is just beyond awesome and helps me scratch my quote itch in a way that also let's me act them out. I am absolutely in love with it! Only question I have and google doesn't seem to give any info, is HOW do you record longer sound clips? I see some clips that are like 10+ seconds and when I go to record, all I get is 6 seconds. Not sure how to change that."
1701,Smashedbro,"April 30, 2015",4,"Tons-o-fun I've used this app a few times now and so far have no complaints. I might be able to write a more comprehensive review if I had a longer time frame to use it in before being asked to rate it. Who knows, maybe it's slowly gathering my personality through my dubs to import into some AI being that will then hack my SSN, birth certificate, and other personal information and then kill me, masquerade me, and trick everyone I love into thinking nothing weird is going on. But would there really be a difference at that point? I mean who could tell? Anyway, if that was happening behind the scenes I'd probably change my rating to one star."

We just kinda send dubs back and forth and decide who's was funnier. We love it. We do them when we are together too.

Anyways if you're a funny person then I recommend this app! And it's free, so if your just not liking it...that's sad...but it's free so you don't have to waste any money...I would pay 99¬¢ for this app if it cost money!

Also when you go to view your Dubsmashes can you go from newest to oldest or have a tab that you can choose from so I can watch newer Dubsmashes without having to go back to the beginning.

1710,Ambient Music Lover,"February 1, 2015",4,"Amazing! But suggestions... I can't believe no one has thought of this yet, it's so simple yet brilliant. This needs to be a new social media app. My suggestions to the makers are that you make it so u can delete sounds that u don't want anymore, fix the stinking tag system (I hate it so far) and make it so u can do custom tags, for some reason I can't do custom tags. Also make recording time for audio longer. 10 sec or however long it is is too short. And make it so u can take multiple shots. Instead of one and done video clips. Other than that look at other suggestions and ur good."
1711,rrrrrrrhonda,"April 19, 2015",5,"So Much Silly Fun and So Easy to Use! This app will not cure cancer.  But that's the point - it is purely entertaining.  The application allows you to create a video of yourself lip syncing to a few bars of all different songs and iconic utterances, from the app itself, from your iTunes account, or you can even record something yourself.  I find it works best when you really get into it, moving your mouth and gesturing as closely as possible to the recording.  I showed my recordings to a bunch of my friends and they all cracked up!  I love this app!!!"
1712,Thaimainhard,"May 2, 2015",4,"Dubsmash feed Honestly dubsmash is my favorite app of all time. I can spend hours and hours on it, and proudly show my friends later the videos and still laugh really hard at myself. The only flaw in dubsmash in my opinion is the fact that it doesn't have a feed just for it. I don't want to keep posting on my Facebook or Instagram my videos because I don't want to spam people's feed with videos of me being silly if that's not what they are there to see. I think that a feed of its own is really necessary and would help boost the app and keep it alive. Keep up the good work Dubsmash team! ‚úåüèº"
1713,Ariana loves you,"May 9, 2015",4,"Longer videos please! I really like this app and I spend countless hours on it playing around with sounds but what would be even better is if they could add longer time.. All they give you is about 15 seconds or so but that's not enough. we really should have the opportunity to go up to 3 minutes but AT LEAST 1 minute and then I'd give it 5 stars. Also we need to be able to record more scenes, we can start the video and hold the record button and then let go to pause and so on, and we should do with given one minute or so of recording. Sorta like vine."

You can record videos of you dancing, lip syncing like Jimmy Fallon, etc. It also works as a soundboard, if you want that. But there is one glitch I've noticed. I have recently tried to record myself lip syncing to songs I recently uploaded, but it is telling me that an error has occurred. I personally don't think I should wait an extended amount of time trying to allow this to happen. In conclusion, though, this is definitely an app worthy of downloading."

I scrolled to the top and suddenly my entire profile was empty. As if I'd never made a dub in my life. Which is sad because I love making dubs and pride myself on them. I turned off my phone and turned it back on only to find that I'd been logged out of my dub account. So weird. Really frustrating. Of the 40 I had, I think some 12 really good ones were saved to my camera roll. Other than that, I'm pretty disappointed, especially since I JUST updated the app this morning. That was a mistake."

In many apps, updates do things to improve the app. Not in this case. Although I love Dubsmash, updates are a pain. Every time the app gets a big update with new features, I can no longer open the app. It will just jump back to my home screen after loading. Then the app will get a bug update quickly after and fix the problem. Then the app will run smooth for a few more weeks until another update, and I am once again locked out. Please fix this problem.

The only other way to look for my previous dubs are by going through my moments . Which takes a while to do . Probably like 5 minutes because I made a lot of videos in the past and that can get annoying after awhile .

The app can only be as funny as you are, so inventive ideas and cool lip syncing can make this app your favorite one. Any downsides? Not one, given I've had it only a night. The app has a feature that lets you make your own sound and trim it to your liking. You can get the sound you use from a video. In the end, Dubsmash is a funny, inventive, and entertaining app. I'm giving it 5 stars."

I don't know if it is just me but I really need some help and I am seriously thinking about deleting the app but my problem is I don't know I it will delete my videos of that are saved to my camera  roll so please do something about it.

I tried restarting the app, restarting my iPad, switching internet sources, but still, no favorites. I also liked the old interface better, you could see more and pause sounds.

And sometimes when I get on the sound it will just have the blue thing and it will play but there is no sound and my volume was up.

I like how it‚Äôs easier to save videos to camera roll but it‚Äôs taking a lot of space from my phone. As you can see there are TONS of Instagram dancers who use dubsmash but since this update most people have stopped using the app and dancing because of this update . As an ig dancer myself , I used dubsmash everyday to make dubs and post them . When we do collabs with other dancers we usually crop 2 videos into each other and we can‚Äôt even do that cause the videos are square!

If you understand what I‚Äôm trying to say. Also you need to fix this search thing who wants to do a dub to someone saying things from a movie the purpose of this app it TO DANCE and now who ever updated it mess it up. PLEASEEE fix this stupid search thing because we liked it the way it was last time. Also I don‚Äôt wanna be dancing in no box cause you can‚Äôt see my whole body.

For example, I‚Äôm not sure if this is just my phone but when we I do a Dubsmash and then I go to another one, the other dub continues to play in the background even if the current dub is playing.

Dubsmash is a app for kids to dance on and enjoy themselves in, not make lip- syncing videos. I loved Dubsmash with all my heart and it used to be my favorite app but now it‚Äôs like your trying to be like everyone else instead of standing out and making the downloaders and people who stood by you happy.

It would freeze after selecting the contact name I want to send to and then click out of me attempting to send the picture message. I only had this app downloaded for a day and already I feel like I want to do away with it so I don't have issues with me other apps or future sending of my pics. Please fix bug.

The keywords are usually very consistent, the comparability is streamlined, and the sound synchronizes perfectly with the video. This may sound like nitpicking, but this app seems like almost a given for an entire community! I wouldn't mind hooking this up to Facebook and seeing a feed of all the dubs that my Facebook friends are making! Like I said, just a suggestion, but more of a luxury than a necessity.

I love responding to normal conversations with famous lines and I LOVE when my friends send me them too!!! It is the best form of comedic relief through out the day! I am SO impressed with the variety of lines! It's too much fun I can't stop!!! And once I start.... I'll keep doing them until my phone dies! It's AWESOME!!!

Sending these snippets to friends has caused a lot of laughter. The app itself works great, though it works best on an iPhone--clearer picture, no lagging. I think Dubsmash has gone through two or three updates over the course of several months, which always improve the look and ease of navigation. Seriously, this app is free. Get it and see if it's for you!"
1736,RaelynWinton,"March 27, 2017",1,What happened I use to love this app. It was so easy & fun but what happened to all the options??? Now you can pick from the handful of mainstream idiotic movie lines and if you want to search for a sound it only gives you usernames and you have to search through all of them to not find the one you are looking for?  Just to post it in budsmash. You can't save unless you post it on the dubsmash app where NO ONE is going to watch it then go to your profile  to save then delete. AND why is it stupid ridiculous with having to log in every time I open the app? I just want to make a simple video I want to send to a friend or save it... is it really that hard to make a simple app?

I do so many over and over again I can't stand it I wish there was more choices to choose from I'm pretty sure on my dubsmash account I've done ""I hate you i love you "" about 15 times in different spots and that's what I think of dubsmash!!!!!"

All we need was the original Dubsmash with ‚Äúmy dubs‚Äù and that was perfect.

1740,jdrindon,"February 18, 2015",5,"BEST APP but one suggestion Incredibly entertaining app, but I think it would be really useful to have all My Dubs one a profile for other users to see. Since my friends also have downloaded it, it would so much easier for them to just go to my profile to see all of the dubs I've made, rather than having to send all of them in an iMessage. Similar to Vine, but if this feature was added it would blow Vine out of the water."
1741,Hemsathdancer04,"June 1, 2015",4,Awesome But Please Read Before You Get This App is Amazing and I LOVE IT! On some of the other reviews people are saying you have to save to camera just to save your dub well that's not true if you have an apple I phone I pod I pad whatever you can exit out and press the home button twice and swipe up so you can clear dubsmash and it works so when you go back to the app your dub is saved another thing is there is a LOT of cussing so if you you don't like your child hearing bad words then be careful with what dubs they play
1742,Kharris99,"September 22, 2015",4,"Awesome!!! But... The app is really fun! I've made a lot of these with my friends and gotten a lot of laughs. People have submitted great sounds and I'm always having fun looking for something new, doing it five times, deleting it, and trying again."
1743,Aviation angel,"April 30, 2016",4,"Could be 5 stars I love everything about this app. It's so much fun! My sister and I used to be really silly together growing up but now that we are grown, have families and live in separate states we have a blast sending each other videos. The only reason this doesn't get a 5 star is because of the disappearing songs that occasionally happen. It gets annoying because it will also shut down the app when it happens. It would awesome if the makers could fix that small issue. üòä"
1744,emma.brockshus,"June 21, 2016",4,Great except for one or two things Dubsmash is great. Kids are allowed to use it and there are great ones for kids. Dubsmash is kind of like snapchat. You can have a profile dub and be  friends with other people. About the profile dub‚Ä¶ sometimes it will play in the background when you are listening to other people's dubs. It gets annoying but after a while you get used to it. Good thing you can push the volume button to make it stop. It is still great though.
1745,Cupcakes222,"November 20, 2016",3,My Favorite App but one thing I'm so happy that this app was available because I love to lip sync songs that I love.
1746,Gin jinn,"November 20, 2016",5,READ THIS! Dubsmash is an amazing app. But somethings to make it even better are to add fast motion slow-motion and maybe add some color like black and white. If you were to do these request I would highly recommend this app to all my friends and make sure they download it! Dubsmash is a great app but these request that I have just made will make it even better please read this and it would be amazing if you could do these request!

1749,nakiyahüòë,"October 14, 2018",5,Horrible I don‚Äôt like the video outcome they be in square and they need to be in full screen. It only show what is happening in the middle section. What if someone is dancing you won‚Äôt be able to see their whole body because they have it in a square mode that you can only see the middle sanction and it will cut some of their body off.
1750,Footballkid545,"February 16, 2015",4,"A few more things This app is the best app! It just needs a few more things, when you wanna record your own sound it is only 5 seconds long and some of the things I want to record are longer then 5 seconds, also some of my videos won't load like the ones I made, you should also be able to pause your recording or the video when you are making it, that would make it a lot better. Thanks for reading my review I hope it helpedüòÑüëç"
1751,Jdbrougham,"February 19, 2015",5,"Great app I know this app just came out, but there are some features that I would like to see added. 1) ability to view all of your favorites 2) ability to have 'tags' in clips so that you can search for certain things other than just name 3) ability to add sound to a previously recorded video. These are just some things that I think would make the app even better, but so far it's good fun :)"
1752,Gl1tt3rK1tt3n,"May 28, 2015",4,"The MOST FUN EVER. This is probably most fun and enjoyable app I have ever had. I can waste hours just recording over and over again. The only thing I would change is making the names standardized of the uploads, like you have to enter the title of the movie or artist. That way you can search for exactly what you want to hear. And I agree with the other reviewers that there should be a way to save your dub recordings in the app rather than save to your camera roll. Otherwise I friggin love this app."
1753,bigrob1625,"December 8, 2015",5,I love Dubsmash!! I use this app every single day!! I would like to add a suggestion though. Imagine if one person could do half and another person do the other half. My friends and or family are not always available and it would be cool to be able to see other people in videos as we go back and forth making a funny video or clip. I think this would be interesting. You could call it DubVid. :)
1754,Why it's fun,"April 8, 2016",5,On my free time Dubsmash is fun because it easy to do it doesn't have many steps. I like to go on Dubsmash because it makes time fly for me. I also enjoy that if you like a sound or a part of a song it is accessible off Internet. I also like it because wile you lipsink on the video you can also do a video and like make moves for it which is really fun.

Search for specific voices, characters, movies, etc.  I come from a family of goof balls, so we send videos back and forth endlessly.  Have had no problems with download or otherwise.  Tons of fun with this.  We use props, and costumes, and lighting to make it even funnier at times.  Tons of voice options, well categorized.  A must have for fun-lovers."
1761,nicOL-yA,"April 19, 2015",4,"This app is so much fun! I'm having a really fun time using this app! It gives me a chance to become an actress and show off my talents! lol Makes the funny memes, popular clips and favorite songs even more interactive. Only a couple of bugs I was able to notice so far...when I'm in a phone call the playback video doesn't pause or stop so I can hear it when I answer a new phone call. Also having issues with the recording playback every once in awhile. "
1762,983ave,"April 29, 2015",4,"Yes but one thing.... I love this app but there is one thing I wish it had...I would love if when you made a dub you could make multiple scenes in one dub itself. It would be nice if it was like vine. For example you should touch the ""start"" button and you should be able to touch it again and have your dub pause. So that would be one clip so far. Then you should be able to keep pressing start and stop until the recording you are making the dub to is over."

And forget all of your problems and within 2.5 seconds . Trust me on this one you'll like it a lot ! What are you waiting for ! Download it now !!!!
1764,RollerSkate33,"July 27, 2015",1,Terrible!!!!!! When I first got this app I loved it then like a couple of days after I when back on it and tried to record something and it said I didn't have enough storage we I went and deleted 217 pictures and videos then I went back one the app and tried to record and I got about half way into it and stopped and said that I didn't have enough storage and I went into my settings and found out that just recording that it took 4 GB off of my storage so now I don't have any available storage and I can't even get it back! So unless this is a problem that is just my phone then okay but if not you don't want to end up like me...

People only care about the making and song of the dubs. This is not Instagram which will also cause your users activity to decline greatly. Ugh the screen is so small o had to step 10 feet away in order for my whole body to be in it. It needs to got back i hate it. No one gives a **** about memes CHANGE IT BACK I HATE ITTTT"

I‚Äôm not trying to be rude or anything. My friends and I do not use Dubsmash as much anymore because of this update. Can we go back to the old one please. It was easier that way
1770,Bellanator03‚öΩÔ∏è,"May 25, 2015",5,Amazingly hilarious It is so much fun my family and I love it. We just sit on the couch chill and do dubsmash.  It actually bonds our family together we have a lot of fun even though we have to do some of them over and over again but it is a great time consumer and a great family app but you have to put more child friendly things. For me I do it in lots of places with my friends and on my own I will always love dubsmash.
1771,Alamocitymama,"June 1, 2015",3,"Please Indicate which ones contain profanity We have so much fun with this, but it's like a profanity minefield. You never know which one is going to drop an F bomb or something of that nature. I have young children and I would like to protect them from this, but there's just no way of knowing until you listen sometimes. For instance, tonight my daughter and I were searching ""miss you"" to send one to my husband who has been away for several days. I was bummed when two or three out of the 10 I listened to contained profanity (but it was not noted in the title/label)."

One time I forgot to update the app so it updated it for me. On the thing it said that it would fix bugs, but instead of fixing bugs it created them. I had to literally go into my settings find the privacy section turn off the photos and then turn on the Photos in the dub smash app in the setting. One of the stupidest and stressful nights of my entire life. I am really tired and I'm glad I deleted the app. Should you keep this app, sure knock yourself. Like I said it was fun."

1794,La'shelle96,"July 12, 2017",2,"Hate the update I had some really funny dubsmashes and they were my favorites but when I updated it deleted ALL of them and deleted a lot of the sounds that I liked so I can't even remake them. Since the update the video lags with the sounds AND there were a lot more categories to choose from to listen to the sounds, now they have really crappy categories to look into. They need to make the categories the way they used to, to make looking for funny dub sound easier. I loved it before the update now I wish I never updated it."

There are a few things that bug me about the app but one thing stands out the most, MY VIDEOS! Every time I look for a video it takes me a really long time to find it. I personally think there should be an easier way to find your videos. I have so many videos on my ‚Äústory‚Äù and it takes so long to find certain ones. I think that the app could really use an easier way to find your videos."

That would make the app 10x better. Also, add some popular songs or stuff, but the whole thing so we can pick what part of the song we can play. One last thing that would make it better is making the songs a little more longer. Can you please do at least one of these. Thanks. Have an awesome day."
1797,keke11under456,"October 10, 2018",2,The reason why people are deleting the app You guys need to fix the quality on the app and we need the rectangle again because the square only shows half of our bodies and we need to show our whole bodies and that‚Äôs just not working for us that‚Äôs not just coming from my point of you is coming from a lot of people‚Äòs point of you on Instagram because we were Instagram being serious what did your mom is done so please I would really appreciate it if you guys fix or update the quality and update the the square to a triangle

Then when the iTunes song finally works, I try to make the video but it says error, and doesn't let me.

One thing though, I wanna do the app with my family but there are so many cursing ones I probably should just delete the app. My suggestion it that in the beginning it could ask if ur okay with cursing like a settings thing. Besides the cursing, it's definetley a lot of fun! Like it could say like child mode or adult mode."
1832,Mcgrubbins,"October 1, 2015",4,"Entertaining !! Unique App, not only can you lip sync to songs, but also sound bites of popular commercials, movies, reality shows, etc.  Only issue I see right now is for occasionally the app won't let you save a completed sound bite due to not enough memory...when you know that is not true & you have a lot of memory on your phone and you haven't saved a lot of your favorites to Dubsmash either??"

However, I have had to delete it from ALL of our devices in lieu of the explicit language. There are SO SO many fun, family-friendly dubsmashes available but when I allow them to use the app unsupervised they inevitable end up playing a clip that has either expletives and/or vulgarities that are extremely inappropriate for minors. My suggestion: either develop an app for kids (like Dubsmash Kids) or find a way to CLEARLY mark explicit clips and create a way to filter them or block them within the app."
1835,Bossynaya,"February 24, 2016",4,Should save on account The dubsmashes should be save on the account not the devices because if i lose my phone and i log in to dubsmash i would like to see the old videos/dubs from my  phone i made on new devices which mean i would like the update to be with being able to see all videos from the first time i made the account and videos from other devices that im logged into
1836,t2xjh,"May 1, 2016",2,"what happened tbh i used to love dubsmash, it was great to make dancing videos for challenges and just regular funny dubs that i could create as well. but then the new update messed everything up. its hard to understand and it crashes frequently. for example, i was trying to preview one of the sounds from a soundboard and pressed the x button because i wanted to preview to stop but it just ended up deleting the sound :( plus viewing your dubs off of your profile is difficult too and i dont see the reason why we need to chat with other people that use dubsmash and have ""friends"" on our profile. i liked dubsmash when it wasnt really classified as a social media where you had to have friends and stuff like that, you could just make your own videos and share them on ig or somewhere else. but now, its just not the same."

My only problem is that when I don't know what I want to make a dubsmash of all the recommended ones are lame. They need to create a popular dubsmash option that lets you do all the now popular dubsmashes. But that's my only problem. Yall should totally get this app
1843,Annebelle671,"August 2, 2015",4,Lots of laughs! I've had lots of fun with this app. I like the feature of searching for a specific topic or words. I do find a couple of irritating cons to it though. I think there should be a limit as to the number of duplicate submissions per category. So many of the same person saying the same thing or recording same song. Redundant. I also find much of the sayings and language very demeaning and offensive.

My friends and I also have dubsmash wars on weekends when we aren't together.  Be careful though for young ones, there can be naughty words in some seemingly innocent sound clips, i.e. Sponge Bob.  The video can also lag a little, most obvious while blinking, but no big deal."

I also wish we could see other peoples musicallys or dubsmash. I would love this app so much more! Plz help make this happen! Also I need more space you can only make 150 dubs and I need more!

1854,Rebecca Alvarado,"August 27, 2016",1,"Lost Dubbs I'm starting not to like this app more and more every day. First of all i lost all of the first Dubs that I did. There was probably over 20 of them. And they are all gone now which is pretty sad because if I had known that dub smash was going to be deleting them then I would have saved them all to my camera roll. And now when I try to make new dubs and I hit save to my dubs they're not there, it only saves a maximum of 29 dubs. So if you try to make you dubs and try to save them to my dubs on the app you can't.  The app is not getting better it's actually getting worse."

Even though I can save it to my photos and there‚Äôs a folder named Dubsmash I would prefer to save my private dubs to ‚Äúmy dubs‚Äù.
1856,Jazz_dancer,"June 23, 2018",5,"Please update I want it to be able to save to my dubs. It only goes to moments. I would also like it for you to see mutual friends rather than searching for long hard names. No one can get new friends with constantly having to search usernames.

1857,Ri Haruhi,"June 30, 2018",2,"Same problems as everyone with one more I have the same issue as everyone else, that I cannot add dubs to My Dubs to keep them private. However, the biggest issue is that I cannot find any of my friends. My theory is that I can only see people who made their account before the update. My friends and I only want to send dubs privately to each other, but thats not possible if we cant add each other (despite we all have accounts). Please fix and we will begin using the app. Thank you!"

Such as better grouping of quotes, more quotes available (will come with time I'm sure), and a Parental Control option to filter out bad language. Regardless, it still gets a FIVE STAR rating."

I deleted the app and went to the App Store to read up on it. READ THE PRIVCY PAGE!  The company says it will basically use your personal information any way they want. Their privacy page is based on a German privacy act, I couldn't find it in English. From personal experience Germany is all about collecting information on citizens."

One improvement would be to start the voice a second or two after hitting the start button.  That would make the first of the recording easier to match to.
1872,Danielleabn,"June 4, 2015",3,"Fun app but needs ""explicit"" label on some of the sound bites This is a fun app.  You can browse through and make favorites to save for the future. I do find there are vulgar ones and they aren't labeled as explicit and should be. I would hate for my young kids with phones to be exposed to them. And anyway who would really want to see a Dubsmash video with such a harsh and abusive tone?  Add more filters and take out some of the random sound bites that are not really professional sounding."

After getting over that I decided to give it another go. And then the latest update happened, and every time I click on ""save to my dubs"" IT DOESNT SAVE TO MY DUBS. So now I've lost even MORE. There should be a ""recents"" or ""history"" area where dubs go if they don't ""save"" (especially even when you've hit...SAVE) OR make it so we can recover lost dubs! They have to be somewhere in the worldwide webs of the Internet."

It literally cut the heads off my videos, deleted some recent ones, and i can‚Äôt even have friends on there anymore. This is a total and complete downgrade from the previous update.

There should be a better selection of sounds to lip sinc to. There are so many glitches when I am looking at my past dub videos. I would like to bring back the selection of saving my dubs privately and not having to share it in my moments all the time as other users are saying.  The updates are not bad. But they are not good either.

When I downloaded an app I expect it to work and not mess up like this
1917,London Swindell,"August 1, 2018",5,No dubs Dubsmash is acting weird when I opened the app and went to see my friends dubs there dubs weren‚Äôt there nor were mine and when I went to go look for my favorite sounds it was none in there so y‚Äôall need to fix this and bring back the old one or sum cuz it‚Äôs lagging and NO it‚Äôs not my phone it‚Äôs the app
1918,Brianna.@,"October 23, 2018",3,Well ... theirs another thing The app is cool n all like the new update is great but when I want to look up certain songs or clips I can‚Äôt find it . Instead it uploads other things that I‚Äôm not looking for and never known existed. I feel like the creators or people who helped upgrade the app deleted it from the create button but I‚Äôm not sure . So I hope you guys could fix that please maybe in your next upgrade .
1919,Mizz SDP,"November 18, 2018",5,This is one of my main apps on my phone I love Dubsmash. I was a fan of it since like 2016. It‚Äôs one of the main apps I go on everyday. The best part of this app is that you can choose different sounds and post LIT VIDS. The one problem is I can‚Äôt follow or add people anymoreüò≠üò≠. But hopefully we can get that feature back shortly.
1920,Iirebekah,"April 23, 2015",4,So ridiculous but so fun. This app is so ridiculous but it is so much fun simple and easy to use. Can do anything from lip syncing to dub short sayings. My only complaint is that there is no feed that you can see other peoples dubs. It would be fun to have a social interaction like IG or vine where you can upload and share in the app and you can see other people who create them.

If the language was cleaned up, I would give this app 5 stars for sure."

If I sign into my Instagram or snapchat all my history is saved but if I sign into my dubsmash on a different phone all my videos are gone. What's the point in having to sign in if it doesn't even save my videos to my own account? Would give 5 stars if it saved
1924,nsk1999,"May 27, 2015",4,"amazing app, but‚Ä¶ whenever i'm done with a dubsmash recently, they don't save! i make a lot of dubsmashes but unless there's a limit to the amount getting saved to the app, i don't know why they haven't been saving. i tried deleting a couple but they still don't save. if there is a limit, I would appreciate if you please make that so there is no limit. thanks!"
1925,Bobert the dude,"May 31, 2015",4,Good app but.... This app is really fun and hilarious but when little kids want to make a dub there is a whole bunch that swear in them so that really disappoints me. I don't know who would want their kids listening to people swearing. Why would something have to swear or be inappropriate to be really funny?! But really good app overall I love it. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

1928,Ritacakkes,"October 28, 2015",4,"Hours of entertainment This app is great for those who are bored and need to kill time then you end up with hilarious videos you can look back on. Two things I would change though. Tags on the dubs so we could more easily find them if we don't have the exact name.

It's amazing but I just have ONE teenie tiny suggestion, everything is perfect, the dubs are funny, the qualities great, i love how you can add those stickers and text but I think dubsmash would be 100% better if when you used the front camera there would be a front facing flash, it would make life so much easier.

Every time I finish making a hilarious recording, when I try to save it a message appears. It gives me 2 options ""Not now"" or ""like us on Facebook"", the not now button doesn't work. It won't let you save it until you like them on face book ( so desperate for likes I guess ) and when you go onto to face book try to exit and go back to dub smash the recording is lost. This app is so disappointing in customer service."

1952,Bladtez,"June 22, 2015",3,"Awesome app but has one problem The app is awesome and I love it. Wish the app could extend the time for uploading sounds. So the problem is that when you are uploading a sound and go back cause you change your mind, the sound will keep playing no matter what you do unless you restart the app. It's annoying to have to restart the app after or changing your mind of uploading."
1953,Karissamarie,"June 30, 2015",4,Good app I really enjoy this app. It's really fun to do with friends and it's funny.

But other than that it's one of my favorite apps!! :)

1985,IHATEWORLDCRAFT,"July 14, 2015",2,"Give me a break Oh my gosh are you kidding me. People are messed up, and caught up with cussing that is just horrible to say. The creators of this app should do something about this. Seriously. If you are reading this don't get the app there's more than just cussing that gets on my nerves. yes there are a few funny or goofy ones to do but really. I'm a Christian a strong believer in God. Now you see how I capitalized God well these people don't. I'm standing up for what's right, hopefully you will too!!!!"

I also wish you could cut out the inappropriate sounds because I wouldn't want a young child playing a bad one. But otherwise, your game is awesome and I loooooovvvvveeee it!!!"
1987,KINGJae55,"December 16, 2016",5,"Came Back I used this app when it first came out, had to stop because I did become too busy to come up with any more ideas. When I came back, it became even better and more easy to use in just over a year of hiatus. Amazingly well done."

1989,Is_that_her,"October 15, 2018",4,1 more thing I think the updates added were amazing but I think that people who use Dubsmash should be able to make the whole screen fit there device instead of only having half of there body in the recording.  I hope these changes can be made.  üíô
1990,Nicolaslind,"January 28, 2015",4,I sense a new social media sensation! This app is a really cool idea. Honestly this app could pass as the new Vine. It has a lot of potential and developers/makers of this smart idea should make it a social media app! One that you can view other participants videos! Some of them are really funny and could potentionally be made with different sounds that are insync to the senerio occurring. Great Idea!
1991,Dameetis,"February 6, 2015",5,Next social network trend! Probably one of the best apps I've ever downloaded next to Instagram! This app opens up so many doors for aspiring actors and the database for sounds is almost endless. Great app!

1992,Trolplolo,"March 22, 2015",5,Dubsmash is awesome I love the fact that i can sound like the famous thing everyone says in school! I like that fact that if i cant mouth the words i can say it out loud to make it look better and dubsmash blocks out my voice so it can look way better!

1993,NE Mom35,"April 9, 2015",5,"So much FUN!! My son showed me this hilarious video dub app and I can't quit playing with it! It's so funny & many choices to never get boring. If I had to say one negative thing, it would be to keep the really nasty ones out. Like ""F--- my p----. ""F---it hard"" (or something like this) for example is not appropriate for many, let alone a teenager."
1994,A humble iPhone user,"April 12, 2015",5,"Great app This app is so fun. There is no other app like it that I know of. I have spent countless hours making videos with the kids I watch, as well as by myself in my spare time. Not only is there a wide array of songs and sayings to choose from, you can upload your own. Highly recommended."
1995,Clara the gymnast chick,"July 15, 2015",4,Great but what? So I love this app and I use it all the time and it's amazing but (this just started today) when I try to search certain things it goes to my home screen and when I re-open the app it's like I closed it in the first place. Idk what's wrong with it and if it's just me or what but if it is someone wright a review too so I know I'm no alone
1996,trtrtrtr101010,"March 12, 2016",2,"Can't connect to iTunes Dubsmash was great until the most recent update. Now I can't record from iTunes, the option has disappeared completely without notice. I went to delete and reinstall the app thinking it may be a glitch. Upon reinstalling ALL of my dubs were gone- so save them to your camera roll! The sound recordings were still there but the videos were gone. Dubsmash is useless without recording iTunes."

I can‚Äôt even recorded my whole body because y‚Äôall updated.

2000,Amar khimji,"February 7, 2015",4,Good app but needs a few fixes The app is great fun to use and you can find almost anything you want on it ranging from old to new. The 2 issues I faced are that i cannot add new sounds to the library and that sometimes the application just closes without any notice. Please fix these issues to make it better for us.

2002,Bluestew,"May 21, 2015",4,Video Lip Syncing for Us A friend posted a quick video of her and her daughter performing a scene from the Wizard of Oz. I could tell they rehearsed it and memorized their lines. I was blown away when I found out that they used dubsmash to make the video. I downloaded it right away and now I'm having a lot of fun with it. You're going to have and share a lot of laughs.
2003,Grace is graceful wows,"June 17, 2015",5,Best game ever!!! Really fun and easy. Hundreds of songs to pick from. Just awesome. You can write words on your video and change what shade of color the video is. You can even make you own songs or use them from your songs and videos. You can put decorations on your video. It is AWESOME!!!!!
2004,Twegles,"June 22, 2015",5,"Great, but... I think they should add the feature of being able to add your own video from your own camera roll instead of just being able to make a video at the moment. Besides that, this app is absolutely amazing and hilarious! üòÇ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

Easy to use, and you could add sounds from your iTunes. You can't even pause sounds anymore if you don't want them, the app won't let you scroll until a track is done. Means if a kid is around and the dub starts swearing you have to close the whole app to escape it. It's ridiculous.

2011,GraceW,"April 15, 2015",5,"My favorite app! 1 request. This app is such a great idea-and absolutely hilarious. My only request is that there be a requirement to identify recordings with an expletive. Some titles seem innocent enough, but then you play them, and an expletive screams through your phone."
2012,Jon713,"June 11, 2015",5,"Its kinda addictive :) I really love it !, it's amazing you can lip sing to the Greatest voices such Luciano Pavarotti, etc...

2015,MrTJL71,"March 31, 2016",4,"Fun App I enjoy this App and would give it 5 Stars if it wasn't for the fact that sometimes when your viewing your profile and the different Videos you created, they will at times freeze when watching them. However, this does not happen all the time."
2016,Pnutmom,"December 28, 2016",5,Love it!! I personally love this app. My friends and I get a kick out of making silly videos. The fact that they are short is a bonus.

I seriously love this app and all the little things it has to offer! so many funny sounds and lines that are recognizable and just plain awesome!!

2021,Kmplatt94,"April 16, 2015",2,"Explicit words I would give this a 5 star. The reason I'm giving this a 2 for the explicit words. The age for this is 12yrs old & older. My son is 12, but I do not want him to make videos with the F... Word in it. Nothing about drinking and talking about your private parts. Either you need to change the age or put the explicit words in one category that needs a password to get in it. This is fun & funny, but kids do not need to make videos with explicit words in it"

2024,MintDani,"June 23, 2015",1,Would be great if it worked for me. I've seen tons of my friends videos from this app so I decided to download it. When i tried to register it said there was already an account with that email address. Funny because I've never used this app before. So I clicked forgot password. It said it sent an email but I never got it. Tried again and again. Then tried registering with a really old email address. Same thing. This app would be great if I could actually register or sign in.

I have tried to do reset password a million times and it says that it is an invalid email/username or password which it isn't.

2041,Cowboysnake,"April 13, 2015",5,Great App This is a wonderful app. I suggest a feature that allows you to pay to remove the watermarks. Not only would the developers make more money but then also I could remove the watermark on the videos making it look more professional.
2042,BmanTheColtsFan,"April 15, 2015",3,"Hilarious but needs more time I love the app but I get frequently disappointed when of think of a great clip and it's too long.  At least 15 seconds should be available, but really 30.  I understand why it's short, I mean, people would want to sing a whole song or act out an entire TV show.  But really, we need about 30 seconds to get some really good quotes out there."

2047,a meh costumer,"February 14, 2018",3,It‚Äôs okay I gave this app a 3 out of 5 because when I got it I thought yay maybe I‚Äôll do all the latest challenges but instead everytime i go bad to the trending page it‚Äôs the same challenge and also another way to improve this app is by making a slow option so people‚Äôs videos can come out perfect and they won‚Äôt be out off breath
2048,Mattstar69,"May 30, 2018",1,"UPDATE PLEASE I miss this app. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs due too the iPhone updates being harder to program for or if the app creators overhauled Dubsmash attempting to try and make a social media platform or one that could compete with Facebook,Twitter or Instagram but the app is borderline trash now. It freezes & crashes constantly. You can‚Äôt save your Dubs and if you upload audio it doesn‚Äôt become available until you log out and log back in.

2057,Flygal13,"December 3, 2015",5,AWESOME This app is hilarious. After seeing celebrities use it I decided to download it. I started getting really into and so did my friends! The ones with two or more people are the best. I would definitely recommend giving it a try. Warning: It might be addictive!
2058,am88j,"May 27, 2016",5,Addicted I started using dubsmash for a while now and i get addicted!! It's a great way to compose small videos of your favorite quotes or songs! I also used with my friends and had such a great time! I say give it a try you never know what will happen next!
2059,Hugghfghcfhcghcfhcfhcfhcfg,"February 12, 2017",1,I GOT RID OF IT IN UNDER A MINUTE WITHIN PURCHAS I got the app cause my Friend told me to try it out and I made my account and all that(it was easy)then I went looking in my account settings to find that I can't have a privet account so random people can just watch me and I don't like that but before I deleted it I made one and it is basically a musically but with out the different filming things like slow and that and then I didn't post it and logged out of the app and then I deleted the app and wrote this review.üò°
2060,Sublime_Life,"April 23, 2015",5,Love it but I've got a suggestion (: I'm totally in love with this app. I wish there was a count down option though. Like between 0-10 sec you can set manually in the settings. Would make it a little easier other then that I'm in love with this app!!!
2061,Andy Zaky,"May 23, 2015",5,Best App of the Year This is the first review I've ever written across the hundreds of Apps I've used and have been an iPhone user since the first day it came out.  This is one of the very best and entertaining apps I've ever used.  Zero complaints.  I would pay $20 for it no problem.
2062,Kdm8434,"August 21, 2015",3,"Wish there was a ""clean"" version for kids! My kids love this! They have fun sending videos to family and friends.

2063,Monkey-yay,"October 18, 2015",4,Amazing! (Except for a recent problem) Dubsmash is such an amazing fun idea! I love making them and showing my friends but unfortunately recently whenever I try send one to someone either from the app or my camera roll it says it can't. Please fix thisüôè

2066,Maddihall18@,"September 18, 2016",5,Addvice Hey dubsmash creator I think you should do an update so that when we make a dud we can choose to make it fast slow or normal like musically I have dubsmash instead of musically because I think dubsmash is better but please take my Addvice because it will make dubsmash betterüòÄüòÄüòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü§ìü§ìü§ì

And now we can‚Äôt even see our whole body on the camera and it looks weird all together it‚Äôs very small

My kids, who are 3 & 5, often play little games on my phone. I am afraid they are going to open the app and discover things and words I don't want them to know.

2071,Some Girl with an iPhone,"July 18, 2015",4,"Great Concept, Weird Glitch The app itself is fine: it's clever, creative, and hilarious. The only problem is that when I try to upload a sound of my own, it doesn't work. The app will indicate that I've chosen my ten seconds of audio, but it's just white noise when it uploads. Other than that, it's a lot of fun. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

2074,Miss Thang 123,"February 7, 2016",4,"Pretty good. Some issues. I really like using this app. It's fun to use with friends and family. But there's some issues.

We really want the old Dubsmash back
2080,TheDipstick,"January 20, 2015",5,Too fun Have had a blast with this app so far. Have spent hours with the family making some pretty funny videos. Not sure why it would be rated any less than 5 stars. It works great and some of the clips end up being hilarious.
2081,Megmo #13,"March 2, 2015",4,"Need to be able to upload videos from your camera roll The app itself is great but you should be able to upload videos from your camera roll instead of having to record yourself everytime, other than that the app in awesome"

2084,Sunflower seed luly,"September 27, 2015",1,Not so good Every time I would try to get in with my email and password it wouldn't let me do it and then it would and every time I tried to make a video it would freeze then it would kick me out then it would start all over again it's horrible I tried everything there was to try but nothing well I don't know if it's just mine or it an official problem well I hope you read this so then you can fix this problem that's going on
2085,PeopleFun,"October 3, 2015",2,"Umm...... Okay, I am 11 years old. My mom told me I can't have dubsmash because there are so many inappropriate things. This stinks because it is really fun. I don't understand why you just can't disable inappropriate items on this app. It's not fair to kids who want to have fun, but are underage. I hope you decide to disable curse words on this app. Other than this issue, I think it's a great app. I hope you decide to change your mindüò°"

2089,Very verry creative,"May 23, 2016",5,Update again plzz You guys should make it as if we delete the app then get it back the videos are still there cause it makes you not want to get it again if all your old videos delete

I love this app so much and it's so much fun, but I had to temporarily delete the app. When I logged back on, it had saved all of my favorite sounds, but not my dubs which really ticked off considering I spent a ton of time on them.

2093,Crazyreed,"June 22, 2015",5,SOCIAL NETWORKING APP Best app ever! Me and my friends make them all the time and they are awesome! But what if you built in the app a feed so it's like another social media app? That would be awesome! I know your team might not read this but if you do this would make dubsmash 10 times better! Thanks!!
2094,MEO_W3,"July 3, 2015",5,I am addicted! I love this app and I heard ppl talking about it and when I actually started using it I became addicted it what I do in my car when I'm waiting to go to work or pick someone up or even when u can't fall asleep at night. BEWARE of its ability to addict YOU TOO.üòÇ
2095,Nvm3!!!,"July 19, 2015",5,More Time I love Dubsmash but there needs to be like a countdown so we can have enough time to start instead of having people start it for us. And on Instagram you see people's arm move from the camera. We just need more time like 3..2..1 or more.
2096,<3 sports,"August 18, 2015",4,"Dubsmash is my life But, okay I guess this is new or something but you click that unicorn button and it shows my saved dubsmashes, but the more I go down the more I can't watch them and save them to my camera roll.

2100,dommjvw13,"May 29, 2015",4,"So much fun!! I love this app, it's fun to do when you're bored, just wastin' time, or just hanging  with friends! My only concern is that a lot of the dubs in the categories are overused, I'd love it if new dubs were automatically updated every week (e.g. ""Popular dubs this week""). Otherwise it's on it's way to being one of the greatest apps of all time!"
2101,Brykry,"May 30, 2015",2,It's fun but has major problems At first dubsmash was really fun but then its flaws started to unravel. Dubsmash takes 3 minutes to load before kicking you out so you have to go through all of it again. The worst part about it was that it deleted ALL of my dubs randomly. I had fond memories in my dubs and now I can't have them...I would advise you to save all your dubs on your camera roll or they will be gone forever.
2102,Alix1202,"June 5, 2015",4,It brilliant but the only thing is... It's like a really great app but the only thing is sometimes it says u don't have any storage but u have like all the storage in the world another thing is on some days the app doesn't let u save the dub even if u do press the finish button other then that this game is great
2103,Aech,"June 25, 2015",1,"Fun but glitchy I love sending people Dubsmashes and making them is even more fun. The problem is when I upload my own sounds and try to record, I get lots of errors. It tells me that I need to make sure I have an Internet connection even though I'm connected. It's really hard to make this work and there's no real way to tell if it will let me record over  uploaded sound or not. Until this is fixed, I'm going to have to keep the app at one star."

2107,Mb98608,"September 3, 2016",1,"Stupid update ruined the app Was an awesome, fun app... Too bad you totally ruined it by changing the format! Such a stupid update, can't figure out how to find anything, can't scroll through my dubs without watching every single one, recorded dubs aren't labeled anymore so you can't find a specific one, can't re-record easily. Oh, and not to mention it deleted all but 29 of my dubs... I had over 200! Thanks for nothing... Completely gave up using it & deleted off my phone. üòíüëé"

2109,rainbowgang1,"December 31, 2017",2,New Update Honestly this app used to be my favorite app. Like to where I probably have over a thousand dubs. So when your new update made it to where you have to go through the old ones to get to the new ones. I‚Äôm probably sitting here for 20 mins just to get to the one I made 5 mins ago. I highly suggest you make a new update to change that. Really love Dubsmash but that update is just a huge downfall!
2110,Madisyndinello,"April 1, 2015",5,Dubsmash Additions ? I love this app so much but I hate how you have to press the button and then the video starts right away. maybe you could add a timer so that the video starts 3 or 5 seconds after you press it so you can get to a spot or something !
2111,LanaeKay,"April 29, 2015",4,Hours of entertainment This game is hilariously fun!!! My only beef is I wish you could delete ones you don't like.

I just love it
2133,Krkl,"July 7, 2015",3,"It was fun until.... I just got the app and it's really fun but, then this add came that would not go away saying that I should like them on Facebook. I tried to dismiss it but it wouldn't go away and then once I liked them on Facebook anyways it still wouldn't go away. I can't even access the app now because the add won't let me do anything."
2134,Kelsay1512,"December 2, 2015",5,"Awesome Super fun with friends/family even by yourself it's pretty fun. :(But watch out for some of the younger viewers, some of them have a bit of bad language) I would definitely recommend it ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning may bring laughter to many: enjoy!"
2135,B-ROD 5,"January 2, 2016",5,Love the Dub! This is great if you are chillin at home or with friends. I don't recommend doing them in public because people will think your insane lol!! My husband thought I lost my mind when he caught me dubsmashin. When I showed him the replay he laughed hysterically. Super fun App! :)
2136,Cece34567,"April 25, 2016",1,Get it together This one day when I was trying to get on the app the screen where sign in or make an account so I signed in and then it took me to the sound board on the first page and when I tried to click on my profile the same sign up or sign in page popped up. So deleted the app to try over again and it did the exact same thing and it's extremely irritating because I want to see my dubs but it's not letting me!!!!
2137,Dub Masta,"June 24, 2016",4,"Dubsmash ROCKS! But... It glitches sometimes and it doesn't have enough memory on it. I need to delete dubs to make other ones, and sometimes it takes forever to load and record sounds. Otherwise it's a great game and i would recommend to anyone who likes to have fun!"
2138,marbet400,"September 4, 2016",4,Where are my dubs? Dubsmash disappeared from my phone and I when I reloaded it w the new version all of my Dubs were gone. Where are they?  Lots of fun over the past year with no ability to share it now.  Anyway to fix this?  Fun app but the fact that this happened is a drag.
2139,OnFLEEK1231,"October 13, 2016",4,Great!! Have some suggestions The app is great but i would add it so you could speed up ur vid and put filters on ur vids also you could just send to ur friends on messages instead of saving your vids on to the camera roll and then sending it to whoever. Yep dats it i love your app!! Hope you use my suggestions!! TYSM üíï
2140,Ny #42,"April 30, 2015",4,Needs one more thing The one more thing that it needs it that when you make a dub it should save to your account so that if you login on a different device you shouldn't have to lose all of the dubs that you made. Hope you take this into consideration!
2141,Dumb idiot man,"May 9, 2015",4,"One problem... This is a really awesome app, I love posting my sounds for others to dub. But lately, the recordings I post don't work.

How can this be fixed so that I can continue to make and save to dubs to the app?"

Every time I try to make one I try to save it but what pops up is like us on Facebook and I try to press not now and it doesn't work! I've already liked it on Facebook. The not now button doesn't work and I can't save my video. It ticks me off. Please fix it!

2152,Fforfatoomi,"August 10, 2015",4,AWESOME but one improvement super fun and entertaining :) only improvement would be to have the option to pause during the recording of a dubsmash to change the setting/character :( otherwise definitely would've given 5 stars
2153,Naznaz22,"October 31, 2015",4,"Need help but I love it .. Nice way to express your emotions , I love it, but from few days my dub app is keep failing to share some of my fav dubs, it share the new one but not those specific ones, idk y?

2154,Dust128,"November 23, 2015",5,"So fun! My kids and I have a lot of fun together making dubs and sending them to friends. One caution- many of the dubs have inappropriate language so don't just hand the app to your kiddo. Otherwise, an incredibly fun way to waste an afternoon!"
2155,Jada._,"December 28, 2015",5,This is the best app in the world Who would never wanna download this app? This app is the best you can do a lot of songs.U should keep making more  dubsmashes I hope all of the these people in the world get a chance to go and download this app! love this app so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
2156,[arkym],"January 23, 2016",1,User Interface This was on of the great set apps in the App Store by far. It's a ton of fun and when you get better red you can take a break and come back to a whole new slew of sounds. 
2157,Lelegotcash,"February 21, 2016",4,"Review for Dubsmash I really like the new edition of Dubsamsh because you can pause your video , you don't have to keep pressing the back button all you ha e to do is just stroll down and it'll just start playing     ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è the new edition so much thanks for letting me update it and I'll totally update to the next edition!!!!!!!!"

I don't have any problems with this app! Fantastic pass-time! My cuz-ins and I laughed for, like, 10 minutes straight! Whoever came up with dubsmash- THANK YOU! TOU ARE A GENIUS!"
2159,Icee Queen,"June 23, 2016",4,Dubsmash It's a good app but if you guys make it easier to view ALL of your dubs would be great because when you have so many it's crashes so maybe you should just let us choose which one kinda the format of the iPhone camera roll! Other than that it's great
2160,Smexorrlent,"January 26, 2015",5,So much potential This app has so much potential.  It could really be the best app around.
2161,A CaliGurl‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,"April 7, 2015",5,So much fun! This app is so much fun but the only thing I would change is for the app to load faster after you recorded your dub to watch it and it should be it's own social media like vine or instagram. Other than that this app is amazing!!
2162,E. Griffin,"June 12, 2015",4,"Addictive me and my family have had tons of fun with this app ,it is addictive, there's something for everyone, The app usually works pretty well in my experience, some of the dubs are a little bit off or don't have clean edges but overall we've had tons of fun with it. Great idea. and for free ‚Äì hello ..."
2163,Dubsmash user,"June 21, 2015",2,Was good until.. I've had this app for awhile now and I opened it up the other day and it showed up the get started page that I already did when I made an account. Logging in again with the same information ALL of the dubsmash's that I've done were erased and everything. Irritating that I made all those videos to create one huge video and never even got to do it.
2164,Erplederple,"July 20, 2015",5,Fun and Easy To Use My friend Alexis and I love this app...it's really fun and kinda pointless which is our kind of app...her and I always make Dub Smashes every time I come over and it's pretty fun...I would recommend this app to someone who is easily entertained and loves to laugh
2165,Evanator4EVA,"August 21, 2015",2,"Where's the deletion!!!!??? You guys said to just swipe left and it will delete but no! It does not work, many people want to delete their dub smashes, but since that doesn't work, many people will start to delete their dubsmash app. So please update it into a version that has a deletion option and a private account option as well, cuz some people don't want their account to be on public!"
2166,Kbarnett5233,"September 21, 2015",4,Addictive!!!! Wish there was a way to separate languages. Sometimes I spend my time scrolling through stuff I don't understand and I miss some good stuff that have titles I don't understand so I don't open unless by accident. That's the only complaint I have. Other than that the app is AWESOME!!!
2167,Hatter girrl,"February 10, 2016",2,"Newest Update , and just updates Here's a tip before you update dubsmash save all your stuff to camera roll because I thought since it's my account it'll save once I upgrade the app and it didn't so all those dubs from January are gone and I'm really mad , I need a new app to use . That will save my stuff when you update the app . Like this didn't happen before when I first updated the app ."
2168,alynstarburst,"June 17, 2016",3,"Update messed it up I love this app and I use it quite a lot. I've had it for some time now but after the newest update it is extremely slow. It takes forever to even play a sound. It also crashes a lot. It's really upsetting because I really love this app, but the new update has made it hard to enjoy :("
2169,KBDubs,"December 17, 2016",3,"New Update Hard to Navigate I love Dubsmash, but the new update is difficult to navigate. There are extra steps to save your video, so I lost a couple of really good ones in figuring that out. Also, the ""add your own sound"" feature seems to be faulty(?), not working(?), disabled(?)...not really sure what's going on there, but it's not working for me. Sad."
2170,Haunted c,"May 23, 2015",5,Great app but need some control Excellent concept combined with great app. Good that the users have the ability to upload their own sound files however they might need some control at some point to sanitize and monitor uploads.
2171,Lauren McAl,"June 3, 2015",4,"Good until .. It asked me to ""like"" the dub smash Facebook page so I did. Now EVERYTIME I finish a video I don't get a chance to save or anything It has the thing that pops up asking me to like the fb page which I ready did and there's no back button or anything. So it's useless at the moment."

2173,Always~Forever,"August 8, 2016",2,"Great app until your dubs vanish This app was the height of laughter between my friends and family and we saved all the dubs to the app because there were too many to save to our phones. Now with recent updates, all the dubs are gone and Dubsmash has lost a lot of users. Also with the new update, you get a lot less of what is hot and trending. Just stop updating what is already perfect!"

My i7+ burns in my hands because the battery runs so hard. The battery use detail shows that this burns 24% battery for 17 minutes of usage. The features within the app are not intuitive and features are difficult to find."

2177,Jalasiah,"September 20, 2018",2,"It freezes then exits app Usually when I want to do a Dubsmash it‚Äôll work, but recently I‚Äôve been trying to open the app and it would open it, freeze then close out of the app and even when it does work eventually it freezes up in the middle of a video or the end and close out the app. Please figure out what the problem is. Please and thank you"
2178,D'Zired1,"October 14, 2018",1,Change it back I get it the app is cool and all to see and is overall pretty. But I can no longer see my body when I‚Äôm doing Dubsmashes and have to struggle for a good angle to fit my whole body in that tiny square. Besides that the app is great I just ask to change the options of how you want your screen. I also like to post my dubs on my Instagram story and have it full screen but Dubsmash has discontinued the full screen. Thank you. üòäüíì

2180,Rolie25,"January 16, 2015",5,Easier way to upload sounds. There should be a way to just record sounds straight into the app. That would make this app bigger and better than the creators could ever imagine.

2184,Sueiejehjsksks,"July 21, 2015",2,"Great app but could use some tweaking I love dubsmash and its so fun to use but I really wish they would display the words on the screen as the audio plays! Also a 3-2-1 countdown delay when you start recording would be nice. It would be much more user friendly this way. A lot of the dubs are extra long with a lot of text, and although the sound waves are a nice touch they don't help much."

2201,chells07,"April 14, 2015",1,App quit working for me. So the first couple videos I did I was able to send or save like I wanted to. Well now after I make a video and I try to either send or save it to camera roll a screen pops up and tells me I have to like the Facebook page or I have the option of pressing Not Now. I have liked the page and even tried pressing Not Now but after every video I make the app gets stuck on this screen. Very frustrating.

2210,Gaming dork,"May 5, 2016",1,Fix this! I really enjoyed Dubsmash but the recent update ruined EVERYTHING! 
2211,GiggityGuy007,"June 27, 2016",3,"Please fix the crash issue Everyone's been saying how whenever people go make a video and try to save it, the app just crashes. It's incredibly annoying, and there's no point in having the app in the first place if this keeps happening. Bottom line: fix this soon, or I'm deleting the app."
2212,Urja1234,"July 21, 2016",1,They are losing all of my dubs üò°!!! I had over 50 dubs and all of the sudden their not there which is unbelievable and now I can't get them back which is terrible because those are memories with friends and family and the whole reason for dubs is to have fun and make memories but what's the point of having this app if it can't save them ? Overall completely disappointed an unsatisfied with costumer service !!!!!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
2213,Ceeroll,"May 21, 2017",3,"UGGGGGGüò° This app only lets you have 75 dubs and when this update happened it deleted most of my dubs that were my FAV. And if you don't delete any and make them they won't go on until you delete other dubs. This is so stupid just let us have all of the ones we want. I deleted this app, but besides this not the worst."

Sometimes I don‚Äôt like to post on my memories so I save it to my dub but it‚Äôs not there anymore can anyone plz tell me what‚Äôs going on?
2215,kxng.jayy,"November 30, 2017",4,I like the app but ... I enjoy the app the app keeps deleting my fav dubs. Then I have to try and find all the dubs I favorited and that takes forever then after that I favorite a lot of dubs it just delete them again and that‚Äôs frustrating. Pls tell me how to stop this or fix it
2216,Zariah05,"January 24, 2018",4,"Saving My Dubs Is A Problem Dubsmash is a good app , but I've been having problems saving my dubs to my phone. Every time it tells me to enable my photos on dubsmash, but it's already enable. I suggest adding the save button on the editing part of the video when you get to put your caption."

2218,TW‚ú®,"October 10, 2018",1,"The new update I personally like how clean the the new update looks but why did you shorten the recording screen. It no longer fits the whole body or phone screen. So now my videos cut either my face or the rest of myself off. And every time I make another dub, it upsets me and makes me dislike this app more and more. Other than that I like the new update just please but the recording screen back to its original size."
2219,NOTICE THIS‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è,"October 14, 2018",1,NOTICE THIS‚ÄºÔ∏è: The new update is cool and it shows a better sense of organization but the thing that I don‚Äôt like is that when u make a video u have to try to fit in that tiny square. Dubsmash should know that it is used a lot for dancing videos and it is really hard to try and dance and fit in that tiny square now. I would like if u could bring back the old way to record your videos. As far as everything else it is okay.
2220,Brose fish,"May 22, 2015",5,This App!!! We love this app. I have gotten many friends and family members just as addicted! My husband and I spend our evenings playing around with it when our children are in bed. It's keeps us very amused and entertained!!
2221,Ms JahGirl29,"May 25, 2015",5,My New Toy üòä I've tried to download it once before but it wasn't working right so I deleted it. üòê I am sooooooo awesomely glad that i decided to give it another try!!! üòçüòçüòç I now have a battle: Netflix vs Dubsmash. Which will take up more of my free time. üòî
2222,Jdfjmfkenfjfnjfnf,"May 26, 2015",4,Just stop The app is great in all but I've had to delete the App several times because the screen keeps coming up saying to like it on Facebook and whenever I press no thank you it doesn't work and doesn't let me do anything else.
2223,Sum84,"May 30, 2015",3,"So fun! But too much vulgarity/profanity This idea is a hit for the whole family. Lots of quotes and songs from top Disney movies. However, I can't let my nephew scroll through and pick one as he would see in appropriate words/ phrases. Other than that adults and kids can have a blast with this app!! Wish there was a clean version!!"
2224,Taylorswiftrocksiloveher,"June 1, 2015",2,Fun but it's a piece of sh** EVERYTIME I go to save the freaking videos it says to enable access to my pictures WHEN IT IS ALREADY ENABLED so I go to my setting and pic and turn it off and back on and it doesn't work! Shut my iPad off and back on and It worked one time and it's back to saying the same thing! It's really ticking me off this app is a piece of crap and this bug NEEDS to be fixed SOON if I'm going to delete it!
2225,SilverDragon39,"August 3, 2015",4,Great App This app is good and easy to use. One caveat though. I would not recommend this for children to use because there are words in the samples that aren't exactly family friendly. But other than that... Get it. It will make your life more interesting!
2226,HIHI ViGGLES,"August 16, 2015",5,BOMB!!! This app is amazing it's so much fun to send these to friends and receive them back!! The options are limitless when doing a dub smash. Only problem is that you can't delete them from your profile.
2227,Jtjhammel,"February 5, 2016",5,So much fun! This is so much fun to use. There's so many different options and you can make a lot of hilarious videos. You can even do it with several people with enough practice! 5 stars in my book.
2228,MrsLightBulb,"March 13, 2016",5,Dubsmash is my everything I loveeeeeeEEE DUBSMASH! It's just amazing all of the things you can do with this app!!! You can create the most hilarious videos and vines and find practically anything. It's my go to app when I want to have a good time. Thank you Dubsmash!!!
2229,Fusisincnxlncnjdudj,"May 1, 2016",5,Not enough space I barely have anything on my device and when I tried to make a dub it said that I need to clear up some space and I would like for y'all to fix thisüôÑ
2230,Nybrittan,"March 31, 2015",5,"Dubsmash This app is phenomenal, cool ,and easy to use. My husband and I make videos send them to each other or post them on our social media sites for fun. I have yet to encounter a problem while using this app I love being a dubsmash user"

2232,WestHills818,"April 17, 2015",5,Dubsmash Honestly just discovered this app the other day thought it was dumb because I didn't know really get the concept of the app but once I figure it out its the funniest most fun app I have on my phone I love it and suggest everyone get it!!!
2233,Jadehawk1,"May 15, 2015",4,"Kid appropriate vs inappropriate segregation would be nice. I like this app and making funny videos w the kiddos, but having a seemingly harmless clip, according to the name, turn into an uncomfortable 10 seconds of cursing and innuendo is no fun. Perhaps a parental control or at least a mark of Explicit (like on iTunes). Otherwise this is a great app, easy to use and fun!"
2234,Qwerty12457346,"May 3, 2016",4,"I liked it BEFORE What was dubsmash thinking with the new update?! I loved this app before the update, but now it's super hard to navigate and everything is just dumb. And there's no mute button on the videos anymore so it just plays over and over. And unicorns, really?!"
2235,Jaay ü¶Ñüå¥üíô,"June 28, 2016",4,Great But... It is great the new update is cool but the bad thing is it doesn't save your dubsmashes anymore like it used to like if you log in on another device and I think it should have like fast and slow and regular and lapse mode it would make dubsmash so much better
2236,The queen of Miami,"August 8, 2016",2,"WHAT KIND OF UPDATE???! I happily kept my dubsmash app remain in my phone. It took some memory, yes. But it was worth it cause I had all the videos saved in the app, secured somehow. And I don't know who got the brilliant idea that in the update the app will erase ALL of my videos in the app. I don't have none left. Anger and disappointment is a statement. I want my videos back and I'm pretty sure so do other people. I'm so angry. ‚Äì deleting dubsmash!!"
2237,Mayajo3,"November 19, 2016",4,Does anyone know this question So I think Dubsmash is great but I don't like the new update where you have to show all your dubs to your friends if you want to save them- therefore I think you should change it back to what is was before. I give it 4 stars.
2238,Betty‚ùóÔ∏è,"October 11, 2018",2,"i don‚Äôt like it as much anymore i missed the old dubsmash where we can go to the ‚Äú my dubs ‚Äú section. I also don‚Äôt like the fact that the format of the video is only in square form, a lot of people liked it better full screen. i would recommend putting those 2 features back on the app . many people are upset because of this."
2239,khmirah,"November 17, 2018",4,Volume problems It‚Äôs great but when I make a video when I‚Äôm finna post the video the sound isn‚Äôt there the column button just isn‚Äôt there so that makes it hard to know if my video is good or not and there is nothing wrong with my volume
2240,Elsamonkey,"July 4, 2015",3,Its ups and downs You can lip sink things that other people have made from different movies and stuff. And it's really fun but there are some downs. Some of the recordings have swear words in them or as the title. And I'm pretty sure that many people including me do not enjoy that. But if you stay away from those the app is much betterüëçüèª
2241,Cooliesummer,"August 13, 2015",5,Fix it I am a big dubsmash user but this new update has got to go i cant even record my dubsmashes because it wont let them play . Can you please go back to the original version . Thanks
2242,yukon_terry24,"August 21, 2015",2,What did you do???!!?! What happened to the delete option for your unwanted Dubs? This app might get better ratings if this feature was added back in when the next update arrives. 
2243,Djpalm5,"August 27, 2015",3,Could use language warnings My kids and I have had a lot of fun with this app. My only complaint is that when we're going through the dubsmashes some have unexpected bad language. I don't know if there's a way to separate kid friendly and adults but that would definitely get a 5 star rating from us!
2244,Chettahdude,"September 7, 2015",5,"Suggestion First of all, this is a great app. My friends love it when I make these, but I suggest having a pause button like in vine. I usually do dubsmashes by myself, and it would be awesome if you can pause your recording. Thanks!"
2245,Tb_13,"December 24, 2015",5,Dubsmash is the best app ever Dubsmash allows you to bring some the funniest quotes to life as your own. With the new update allowing you to type little messages across the screen makes sure you can clarify your dub.
2246,Crazy Maddie is Awesome14690,"January 5, 2016",5,"This is the best app ever created This app is so Awesome I have nothing else to say because there are not enough words in the whole world, even if I don't know about them yet I bet they still wouldn't be enough. Awesomeness, Mackenzie out."
2247,AlexNole,"March 11, 2016",2,"Great before the update Great app before the update, which now has taken away the feature of using your own music from your phones library. Either I'm missing something or the developers took away one of the best features for this app -- being able to add your own sounds for friends to use! Please add this feature back into the app!"
2248,vritterv,"April 1, 2016",5,Laughed and laughed! Really having fun with Dubsmash!   Can't remember when I laughed so hard.  Although I think everyone should have to submit their very first one when they just stared blankly at the screen while it records their blinking!!!

The other thing that bugged me is that dubsmah has deleted my videos one time also . If you won't a high star rate from me then you have to get that fixed right away üôÑüôÑüôÑüòïüòïüòï
2250,Swift_Donkey,"January 31, 2015",4,"Adding sounds... Having difficulty adding sounds. Every time I attempted to add a sound, a message pops up saying ""An unexpected error occurred.

2251,Opinionatedwriter,"March 17, 2015",5,Great app one minor This app was purely amazing. It was great and I use it daily. Now me and all my friends have purchased this app. The best part is that it's FREE! This hilarious app is awesome. Maybe each category on the dubs could have an age recommendation because my friend clicked one that wasüò¨ GREAT APP!üëåüëèüëä
2252,TGIF 20,"March 24, 2015",5,DubSmash This app is the best app the could've made. I've always mimed words from movies and songs as if they were coming out of my mouth. My mom gets annoyed with me lol it's a none stop comedy and I love that new things get added constantly.
2253,Alischmel,"April 7, 2015",3,"WAS having fun.. I was having a great time making videos.. Then it asked me to like them on FB or press Not Now. At first I pressed the Not Now button and it wouldn't do anything, so I tried liking them on Facebook. Well neither one worked so now every time I make a video it won't let me continue saving it or sharing it. Such a bummer."
2254,Celo_saint,"April 10, 2015",4,Opinion Nice and easy to manage app. A few improvements would be a plus though. 
2255,Yukonsoup,"May 7, 2015",5,Medicine Truly a good time when using and watching others. I think it's awesome if you could read what is being while it's being said that would set it over the top. It rocks and love using it !!!!
2256,Ach1218,"May 9, 2015",4,So fun! I stayed up WAY too late making video after video! I love how you can press start/stop on your own timing and can remake the vid as many times as you want/need to get it exactly how you want it! I wish the movie quote clips were arranged by movie title though. Otherwise! Genius app!
2257,Dubcistic,"May 11, 2015",4,"Dubsmash I like this app a lot. My particular wish would be that there was a little more control, and organization of the library of sound bits. "

Also the quality is very horrible , and i can barely see myself . After this horrible update I‚Äôve deleted the app and rated this app 1 star . DO BETTER !"
2260,johhnthomas,"May 29, 2015",5,Lovely bits of hilarity Before I had this app I was in a low place. Thanks to dubsmash I can smile again. There are so many was to giggle here.

2261,olivia_ojso,"June 27, 2015",3,"ughhhhh!!! I had this app and LOVED it, but then I had to delete to take pictures on vacation so I would have enough data until I could upload them to the computer.

2262,Jenna30235,"July 8, 2015",5,Yaaaas I'm really liking the whole captions with photo/video trend that's going on. There's another new app called Captionable that has the same sharing/captioning kind of feel. Definitely would recommend this!
2263,WanderlustSNW,"July 29, 2015",5,"Dubsmash is funny AF So yeah, easy to use and great soundbites preloaded or record your own. Great app that helps you makes hilarious, short videos. Only thing, I wish I could see other peoples vids on the app. Maybe set them up like the Vine format üòú"

2266,Ejsutt,"September 21, 2015",4,Could use some change Being able to pause and restart during recording would be very useful. As well if it were made into a social media rather than just a recording tool.
2267,FunGal1691,"January 27, 2016",3,"Please bring it back to the previous version I dont understand this version because when you make a dub smash and you don't like it, you can't go back.

2268,Okay but not okay,"August 26, 2016",5,Lost All My Dubs I recorded a couple of dub smashes with my best friend and we wanted to go re watch them but i went to go look and they were ALL gone. It was an completely waste of my time. This new update is ridiculous üòíüò°üò°üò°

There is no point. DUBSMASH IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SOCIAL MEDIA APP! There were other purposes to it. Most of your users can from dancers. You took away the filters, and I don‚Äôt know how to use Dubsmash now! Your users are going down because of this dumb update. The highest to 0 is 1. If it was up to me you would have a zero.

2273,Pajhina,"May 12, 2015",3,"Fun app I love this app and would give it 5 stars, but more than half the time when you create a video, preview it and see it's right, when you go to share it the audio is no longer lined up with your speech. Fix this and I'll adjust my rating. "

2275,The Chaos Monkey,"May 23, 2015",4,"Good times App works just like it says, although since clips are user submitted and named doing a search for something specific can prove frustrating. Regardless, this is about as much fun as one can have effortlessly annoying one's friends with endless video assaults."
2276,EKAKJD,"August 30, 2016",4,"Good enough? They should add a fast mode like on musically. I wish that they had it all the time. If they did, I bet more people would get app. Or a least some kind of other mode like a slow one. A fast mode would still be a lot better I bet."
2277,Lil najah,"April 5, 2018",2,"This App Is Trash now üöÆ Well What happened to making the dubsmash in a square boxed video instead of a portrait boxed video ?

2285,Frost269,"December 28, 2015",5,"Stop being so needy for approval!!! Great, love it, needs better sound samples, maybe a search filter to better find licensed samples for the videos.

Id like to be able to save the videos to ""my dubs"" automatically, especially since I catch some of the best recordings drunk-- but forget to save emüòÇüòÇ"
2293,UsualDosage,"June 1, 2015",1,"Junk I never leave reviews but this app is so hard to use and buggy I felt I had to. What a shame. A cool idea executed by utter idiots. Protip: maybe find real programmers to develop your apps instead of dilettantes? App is hard to use, hard to select a sound, won't allow horizontal usage, and evidently doesn't think I have an Internet connection. What a massive disappointment this app is. So much potential. Maybe next time pay real developers?"
2294,Dcj2001,"December 19, 2016",3,Saving my dubs I mean the app is a good app in general. It's something everyone loves to use but here's the problem . You can't really save . It gives you the option to save you video and then when u go and check your gallery it's not even there. Which defeats the whole purpose . Still needs work
2295,Queen Tabbi,"March 17, 2018",4,Cool but need more improvement I love this app but whenever I want to do my own sound it tells me to 3 tags but it never works plsssss help ME!!!! 
2296,MoeBunny,"August 29, 2018",1,No way to delete account Someone used my email address to sign up for an account. I found instructions in their terms of use to delete the account but the path they indicated to follow didn‚Äôt exist (on their website).  I downloaded the app to try that way and wasn‚Äôt able to find any way to delete the account there either. Don‚Äôt sign up unless you want to have an account forever.

2313,Promprom,"May 10, 2015",4,"Needs refinements. I love this app! As others have stated before, there needs to be a better way to organize the sounds in order to weed out the bad quality sounds and keep the good quality/popular ones. Also a feed would be great!"

Every time I go to record a dubsmash the app crashes and takes me back to my home screen. Then I have to go all the way back to the recording and do the dubsmash again, very frustrating.

2331,Bah H. Bug,"March 16, 2015",1,Update delete's all videos!!!!! Used to love this app - but the updates have ruined it. They have a 'my dubs' section and 'my sounds' section making it seem like all those videos are saved (isn't that the point in creating an account???). Yet whenever you update the app it deletes all prior videos unless you save to your camera roll as well!!! so ridiculous and an asinine business model. At least tell people for God's sakes!
2332,Elsoybean23,"April 24, 2015",5,The New Meme! So. Much. Fun! My only complaint is there's no filter or no way to at least know what's explicit before listening. That would make it more family/kid friendly :) whoever came up with this app is a genius!
2333,Coconutsmom,"April 25, 2015",5,Best app ever This app lets me send funny videos of me to my best friends and they can send some back it is just really fun but I guess it can get boring if you do it to much but besides that it's really good so just don't play it to much
2334,Greeneknight,"May 7, 2015",2,Great app but has a bad glitch. I've had this app for over three months and at first i didn't have problems. Then about three weeks ago I would open the app. It would open and go to the main scree and then just shut the app down. I'm only able to open the home screen for two seconds before it shuts itself down.

2345,Acwwillis,"June 5, 2016",4,Fix this ! I would be making dance videos. And they are a lot of work to master so after at least 10 tries I finally get it. Then guess what...YOUR APP CRASHES. It just resets itself and I have to get it perfect again. It's annoying! Very VERY annoying.
2346,Ms.Lovin it,"June 21, 2016",1,Horrible Dubsmash has all these features and everything. That's great but every and I mean EVERYTIME I create a video and press the button next it says processing your video or something like that and the app just closes. I looking online went through my settings and not a thing has changed. I'm very upset because before this update dubsmash was the app I used twenty for seven. Please fix this crash. ASAP. Please and Thankyou. -Robyn

And I done really like the update because of the video view wise but I love this app but I like the older version kinda better with viewing my private videos and I can save it like that
2380,Marcela Delgado,"February 6, 2015",4,"I love this app but.. I love this app but I think we should be able to record several videos instead of putting them all together in another video app. The app is perfect, just think It will be better with that feature."

2383,Cottoncandygirl137,"April 19, 2015",5,Awesome Because of this app I have been procrastinating on homework and tons of other work. It's hilarious and lots of fun. My friends and I love to play on this when we're bored. Normally I never write reviews but this app is too good
2384,Ava loves cheerleading,"April 20, 2015",5,Love it but... I love this app sooo much and it is incredibly funny and fun but it only allows me to watch a few of my videos and so I have to delete some of the videos that I saved but over all I thing it is a great game!!!
2385,trybond,"April 22, 2015",5,Fun app Love the app kids and I have so much fun with it. Only problem is the ones who submit recordings of themselves voice instead of the actual acting scene. Other then that I love the app and have so much fun with it.

You could change the way the sound sounded, you could change the color of the camera and add a caption. You guys ruined the old dubsmash. I can barley do any of that anymore. You are losing tons of famous that use this app. No one likes the new update why not change  it back?"

I may still use it just for the sounds but ONLY for that I have to use a WHOLE different app (sc) just to put anything on there. Can someone tell me how to take this update off?!

2396,Kas987flga,"November 24, 2017",2,Getting worse with each update The original Dubsmash version was by at the best and most efficient. Each update has brought on a slew of problems and bugs. This latest ‚Äúupdate‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even load the sound preview.  If we can get back to the basics like the original DS version I think a lot of users will be happier.

When you make your video your quality of your iPhone camera goes down abundantly and that is a HUGE problem for me and the glitches are very troublesome. If you are looking to install this app I want to instill in you that you do not want to waste your time and energy to.

2402,Isaacnbriar,"June 4, 2015",4,"Fun app! It's a fun app. The only thing is that somehow, we should be able to filter through the dubs that aren't that great. If I'm looking for a ""Wedding Crashers"" quote, I don't want to hear every dick and Jane's version of it. I want something clean and the original. Other than that, it's a fun app."

2407,Kayla7704,"August 7, 2015",5,Amazingüôä I think it is great for when your bored but the thing is you need wifi. It's fun when your with your friends but you have to have wifi/data planüôà
2408,DiddlyDoo257,"August 16, 2015",5,DubSmash I love DubSmash SO much!! I've been doing it with my friends and family. We don't usually do the videos to make them good. We make them to entertain. The best part is that it's free and there is no ads. Thank you creators of DubSmash! ‚ù§Ô∏è
2409,Cutey Me 1,"August 16, 2015",3,I like the update but there is a problem I like the update but you can't delete. I need a delete button their are certain ones I don't want. Please fix the no delete button issue! If you had a delete button I maybe would have gave it a 4 or 5 star.

2417,decemberbaby_29-,"October 15, 2018",2,It needs improvement The new update is cool but we need to be able to see other people Dub-smashes and the size the screen is for dancers can throw you off and it is aggravating because you don‚Äôt know if you are in or out of the video so if you update again can you go back to some of the old things.

2423,A confused mfüòê,"January 2, 2016",3,"üòê The app is good but what's the point of making an account for it if when you log out or delete the app and redownload it, the dubsmashes you made are gone ?üòê That makes no since there might as well not be account for it if your previous dubs aren't saved üòê."
2424,Jshdhdhd I,"February 10, 2016",3,"Lag I really enjoy this app and I thought the pause feature was a great idea, however, whenever I make a dub, the words don't match up with my mouth.

2425,üòéüòÉüòéüòÉüò±,"June 21, 2016",5,Amazing I really love dubsmash. It's super fun sending them to all my friends. I do have a suggestion. Dubsmash should have streaks with people like snapchat does. And maybe even similar filters such as the dog or flower crown ect.. ‚ù§Ô∏è

2427,Skeet5449,"July 26, 2016",4,Good! The app is fun and easy to find everything. I like how you can send a dub to the people you follow. You can write on your dub. There is a lot of dubs with curse words and I wish there was more dubs that were more appropriate for kids but overall it is a very fun app.
2428,DrawmeYup,"October 6, 2016",2,"Needs filters and debugged. Be cool if you could add filters to it and in different parts of dubbing when you record to make it more dramatic. Also, it crashes. And, you could add the part back where you could upload a video that you already created, that bit the big one when you took it away."

2432,Skymini050703020804,"May 17, 2015",5,So dope!! I absolutely love this app. But something that would make it ten times better would be a timer option so u don't have to go right into the video you can get in place..
2433,Vicky Ieshia,"May 18, 2015",5,So much fun!üòÄ I love this app. Heard about it for a while but just started using it today. It's very fun. You can spend hours on it. The only thing I wish is that videos were longer.

I deleted it again and downloaded it 5min after I deleted it and it's still doing the same thing ughhh
2436,m91.sanchez,"July 4, 2015",4,"Good, but has potential Awesome idea, but they need to add editing features to make it more flexible. Has lots of potential if they develop it more! Would be cool if you could add it to other videos that have already been recorded, cut up sound bites, etc."

Long story short, its not appealing and I don‚Äôt like it."

2561,Chirag Pankhawala,"March 18, 2016",4,"My fav pass-time thingie! I love this app. Rarely saw any issues. I wish there was a play-pause/record/stop button integrated with iPhone volume button. Also, make a live feed to view hot new dubs that users post publicly."
2562,Byron reeves,"March 27, 2016",4,"Hilarious This app is pretty funny, love the variety that you can choose from the only issue I seem to have is that it will freeze often. It usually solves after closing the app and re opening it ."
2563,Airyy73,"August 22, 2016",1,"My Dubs Before the app updated to the new version, I did some videos and I sent them to my private dub space. I exit out from dubsmash for just a second or two, I wanted to go back and re watch what I did and it isn't there......üò† the new update probably deleted it as it was going cause now I did all those videos for nothing and I'm not doing it again.."
2564,miracle brownleeüòÜ,"November 9, 2017",1,Opinion about the new update Dubsmash was my favorite app I used to love it so much until its newest update it‚Äôs horrible like I wish it can go back to saving them in the Dubsmash camera roll not the phone and it takes to long to play a certain song I used to love everything about it.. come on Dubsmash I know you can do better by going back to the old version plz
2565,Jalinangel,"January 20, 2018",3,Add the feature to where you can save your dubs to the ‚Äúmy dubs‚Äù!! Every time i make a dub it says download or save to your camera roll. There‚Äôs no way I can save them to the ‚Äúmy dubs‚Äù section. I would like it if you guys added that feature back on your next update.
2566,fsvybj,"March 27, 2018",4,Add slow-mo button I would like to be able to go into slow-mo during my dubs. It would make the videos so much cooler and a lot more people would download the app! I hope you take this into consideration!
2567,JadaLB,"August 4, 2018",4,Glad I‚Äôm so glad you guys updated because I wasn‚Äôt feeling the whole can‚Äôt save your dubs on your account anymore without others seeing. You had to save it to your phone.
2568,Aijah.P.Best,"September 20, 2018",4,Eh Sometimes when I‚Äôm finished with a dub it glitches to where I have to delete it. When I try to make a sound it always say network error when my connection is fine.

2580,Bananas hannaa,"February 7, 2015",3,Great app!! I really like this app and it's a really good idea but one thing I think they need to fix on here is when you are recording there should be the words to what you are supposed to be setting up top so you don't mess up because some of the recordings are pretty long to memorize.
2581,ryphi12,"March 16, 2015",5,One of the most fun apps ever. I have already spent hours playing with this app and will continue to for a long time. I don't see his getting old any time soon.

And plus, this is going to make a lot of people go back to tik tok, including me!!!!"

2656,Litt102,"November 5, 2017",1,No saving Also we can't save our dubs to our camera or see who seen the dubs this is crazy we can no longer save our dubs to ‚Äúmy dubs‚Äù nor can we put emojis on it we also can‚Äôt see who sees our dubs and we have to go all the way to our first dub to see our last this is making me mad and if it‚Äôs not fixed I will delete and stop using the app .üò°
2657,SelfieQweenüëë,"November 5, 2017",2,Soooo what happened to ‚Äúmy dubs‚Äù I used to use this all the time. And I used to enjoy looking at my private dubs that were too goofy for anyone else to see. Please bring that back because I don‚Äôt have enough space to keep saving to my camera roll. I would‚Äôve giving this 5 stars like a month ago.
2658,TheOfficialDorien,"October 11, 2018",2,Update üëéüèæ This new update has many great features BUT... i am asking for you guys to bring back the video filters and revert back to the old aspect ratio that the dubsmashes used to be displayed as. This smaller screen of video that you shoot now is the reason why most instagram dancers/dubsmash users has stopped using this app!
2659,lily/leelee,"October 14, 2018",4,Change it pls I don‚Äôt like the new dubsmash update everything is fine except when u record it‚Äôs square I would like it back where when u record it‚Äôs not square
2660,Loveness2001,"August 12, 2015",4,Needs delete button I love dubsmash but it really needs to have a delete option because its very annoying not being able to deleteüòí
2661,Singersville,"August 15, 2015",4,"Great app and fun! Some content too explicit... I haven't updated yet and I'm kinda afraid to from the reviews I see...but, the original app I love! Just one prob...too much explicit content! Maybe we can separate the dubs that have explicit language in it?"
2662,Megs-a-mill,"August 19, 2015",5,Love this!! I absolutely LOVE Dubsmash!! It's so fun to just dork out with your friends (or even by yourself haha!) and create HILARIOUS videos! Love love LOVE this app!! A friend of mine and I have been having 'Dubsmash wars' and it's too funny to even explain! I won of course ;)
2663,2nd_St_Annie,"August 21, 2015",5,Love to Dub A friend introduced me to Dubsmashing and we spent an entire evening dubbing back n forth.  I was instantly hooked!!! I can't sing but I look so much better doing it this way. Props get extra points!!
2664,Wowzerzers,"September 9, 2015",3,Very great but language This app is awesome but it should have children's mode because of the language goes too far. This app has funny dubs. But just letting the parents know about this app and how it cusses in a very bad language. But there are still a lot of fun dubs for kids. Thanks for reading!üòã
2665,Satch623,"October 26, 2015",5,Great! But some Flaws. The app Dubsmash is amazing! üëç but the app freezes every once in a while and I have to turn my phone of like 5 times. Needs an update. ASAP!
2666,Swimmer428üê¨,"October 27, 2015",5,Da best!!! It is sooooo addicting. I love it because you an send random messages to your friends and it is really fun just to see yourself talking funny or something. I highly recommend this game.

2668,ninacavini,"December 25, 2015",4,So fun and addicting! I love this app but sometimes the video and sound don't match up and it would be nice to have more variety that isn't just mainstream pop/reality show/hip hop.. How about some more old school options!
2669,Chana brukman,"January 25, 2016",5,Funny sounds Dubsmash is so funny because you can make yourself lip singing to the real song it's really cool how it works that way .funny sounds make my day so put more funny sounds thank you üòÄüòÄüòÄüòéüòéüòéüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

2674,Bfamily2377654,"May 28, 2015",5,"Love it! This is by far one of my favorite apps! I wish there were more ways to edit the dub.  Trim, add more stickers at a certain time in the video, etc.  "
2675,Tara LegMac,"June 27, 2015",4,So much fun!!! Love this app! It hilarious !!!! Great fun between friends and I! But after some videos it won't let me record and send them. even if   it's not saving the video to my phone and I deleted a bunch of stuff. But still love this app!!!!
2676,GoingRogue,"July 14, 2015",5,"New Toy Dubsmash is pretty fun!! Doesn't have that many problems but with the couple of problems, they're easy fixes. It's my new addiction and I love playing with it!!"
2677,mickeyfan64,"July 16, 2015",5,Filter-Family/Explicit Love this app! One thing definitely should happen is need to label family/kid safe or explicit. Can not safely use with children present. Please make this happen :)
2678,Jennifer_Siegell_Severino,"July 23, 2015",5,Best app ever!! Omg! If you're looking for a lot of laughs download this app!! I have created a circle of dubbers within my network that keep me on my toes and make me want to improvise with props with my dubs! They should have a dub contest!!
2679,Dkjdhhshajkakdbakalsjx,"July 23, 2015",4,"Amazing!! But just ONE thing, I want to be able to pause the video but know where I left off so I can start it again so I can make the rest of the video in a different place. Does that make sense?"
2680,Naetimes2,"March 1, 2015",5,Nae One of the best apps in the App Store I personally think it's so much fun and hilarious I don't make regular videos no more.. Would be cooler if you could share video on vine or snap chat easier
2681,Tabitha Barrineau,"April 16, 2015",5,Love it! Great laughs and easy to use! The only complaint is that some of them are vulgar and have very foul language making it hard for my kids to use.
2682,Gmonay32,"April 18, 2015",5,Really fun. Wish there was a easier way to make the tracks Really fun. I wish there was an easier way to make recordings of quotes not already in the app.

2684,Aniyah Mcdowell,"January 30, 2018",5,Review I love the app but I do not like the update because you can‚Äôt save them to your dubs and only your moments and now it‚Äôs acting weird it‚Äôs no new trending sounds.
2685,Hey please change,"October 9, 2018",1,"Why? I am not happy with the update I can no longer send dubs to my friends or have friends on it, I can no longer pause it during the dubs which most of my dubs require, there are no more filters."
2686,tayy0415,"October 12, 2018",1,"Do not update!! I do not like this update AT ALL !!the videos are always flipped when you save them, they save in ‚Äúsquare mode‚Äù and the whole app is just pointless now I love the old update better because the videos saved how you wanted them to and you didn‚Äôt have to worry about you videos being flipped which makes the videos look dumb üò≠üëéüèΩ"
2687,yeeaa.sydd,"October 16, 2018",5,Go back You guys need to go back to the old Dubsmash for all the Instagram dancers more people stopped using your app when you updated it

2697,gxyleee,"May 7, 2016",3,"Having second thoughts ‚ÄºÔ∏èPLEASE READ‚ÄºÔ∏è I honestly love the app. But, after 5mins on the app it glitches out. I also liked the feature when you add a sound and ""select from ITunes"" but it's gone. I actually used it to make my dubs sound more quality."
2698,Viedlabxl,"July 22, 2016",4,"The update I tried to log in and log back out like you said but that didn't work so hopefully you'll figure something out because these dubs mean a lot to me, thank you."

2704,Marybethstansberry,"May 5, 2015",4,LOVE IT The reason i gave it only 4 stars is because I thought that I should have more options on what to say also I think that they should be able to pause it. How ever besides all of that it is great
2705,LumperJohn,"May 11, 2015",5,Yup Love this app. I hope whoever made it is getting rich because they deserve it with all the joy and fun it has brought me and all my friends. I wish I had thought of it.

2707,Super smokey 101,"June 19, 2015",4,Awesome! I think dubsmash is a great app because it is funny . But the reason that I didn't put five stars is because it has some bad words in it. So I don't think this app is appropriate for little kids . But it is still a funny nice app!üòç
2708,Todd in Detroit,"June 21, 2015",5,"Amazing I've never written a review before, but I'm compelled to say this is the best app idea I've seen in many, many years! Bravo! Many hours of fun with friends and family. Hilarious!!!"

2719,ABPayton,"November 7, 2018",3,The new update The new update isn‚Äôt as good because I still had old videos and it isn‚Äôt on my new update anymore. You should bring back the filters because I don‚Äôt like the normal lighting flash on the camera.

I haven't got on it in forever because it takes minutes to just open the app. And sometimes it opens then unexpectedly closes.  Not to mention (which btw outraged me) it deleted all my old dubs! And some of my new ones! IT DELETED my dubs I first ever made on my birthday with my best friend! It's ridiculous!! Actually improve when u update DUBSMASH! ROTTEN TOMATO!

2729,Evaaaü§©,"October 12, 2018",1,Horrible and won‚Äôt use it again. The new dubsmash update is HORRIBLE. It only lets you make square-shaped videos.

2891,dalami81,"May 11, 2015",2,"Fun, but... Two stars for how fun the app is, but the ""unexpected error"" issue keeps it at just two stars.

2896,Tommyservo,"June 3, 2015",3,Fun. But needs a couple improvements The one thing I would absolutely love is if this app were to increase the time limit just a little and add an optional countdown before the audio begins. Just a 3-2-1 countdown would be great to help me get ready for the performance.
2897,AmandaNM6289,"June 5, 2015",5,Love it! üòçüòç My only complaint is that MyDubs are no longer saving on the app (but I can easily just send them to myself in a message for now).
2898,Brianna Holmes,"June 21, 2015",5,A for effort It's a great app. I wish there were funnier choices in the comedy section because I like making funny dubsmashes. But it's definitely awesome aside from that.

3629,anime_obsession3780,"September 1, 2015",3,Just one problem for me. Dubsmash says to make sure I have an active network and I do. It's not accepting it though when I make an account and it's really bothering me. Other than that is a good app.
3630,SarahTruemper,"April 25, 2015",5,Always makes me smile! This app should bring a smile to everyone's face! Makes me laugh every time!
3631,KraftHP,"April 28, 2015",3,"Great, fun... Super vulgar though. Meaning, as I am scrolling through the many sounds, all the sudden there is an fbomb or other vulgarity randomly set in between all the other sounds."

5301,poptarts._.,"October 8, 2018",1,i dislike it so much üö®. this update is trash & very unbelievable ! i actually thought everything would be much more undated n well thought about ! but i guess not . i dance on this app ! not for sum stupid memes ! change the screen size back to 9x16 instead of square because it‚Äôs annoying ! this is much of a downgrade for this app . i thought this will be well planned but no . it was a waste of my 3 minutes updating it .! üëéüèΩ
5302,TT‚ò∫Ô∏è.,"October 10, 2018",1,"Update The new update is horrible, it causes your app to move slow and the quality look horrible. please keep it the same or make minor changes."
5303,alinnaü§§.,"October 11, 2018",1,HORRIBLE I used to love dubsmash because I liked the sounds but now since this update I hated it why do we have to make the video square? Why can‚Äôt we type our names this is bs I still like the sounds so I give it an 1
5304,hgdfh vx,"October 12, 2018",2,I don‚Äôt like the new update I don‚Äôt like it for iPhone 6s because you can only see half of the screen when you do a dubsmash. Please fix this
