0,spiralsun1,"March 19, 2019",5,Easiest best photo enhancement app This is by far the best photo enhancement app I have ever used. It is so much better than anything else I have ever seen in automatically and intelligently making your photos BETTER not just different that there really is nothing else out there that even comes close. When I see the lower reviews I realized that sometimes the reviews are just worthless. This isn‚Äôt a goofy Snapchat filter. It‚Äôs a serious digital portrait enhancement. Nothing else comes close.
1,JohnP95,"February 1, 2017",5,"Great Self-Picture Taking Application I saw this app when I was browsing through the Microsoft apps and I thought that I would download it and offer my thoughts after using it for a little while. I must admit that I am pleasantly surprised with how easy, successful and interesting this app has proven to be. I think this is one of those must-have apps for anyone that frequently takes pictures of themselves or with other people. The simple, subtle and noticeable difference that the Microsoft selfie app offers in comparison to a normal selfie generated from the iOS default camera is astonishing. I would recommend this app to everyone. Well done, Microsoft."
2,I Met Zach,"March 13, 2019",4,Turns volume down So far it works as advertised on my iPhone 8 Plus and I haven‚Äôt had any issues except one. I had iTunes running in the background and this app turned the volume all the way down.
3,Thunderbird74926482,"December 7, 2019",5,"Made me squeal for some reason Upon seeing the 3 star review I was somewhat skeptical that it was going to be anything worth getting. However it IS Microsoft and they know what they're doing. Normally I think I look horrible in photos, especially selfies. But when I used the apps features and compared it to the original I actually squealed because it was actually REALLY GOOD. That's kinda weird cause I'm a guy but still it's a good app"
4,LynleyGirl,"December 1, 2017",5,"Could the magic extend down to my neck? I thought this still didn‚Äôt work (file selection from camera roll or other places), but figured out it was something disabled in restrictions in settings- photos couldn‚Äôt be accessed by other apps under privacy.  I love üíï what the editor is capable of! Looked as if I had an eye job & laser facial. Wish it would extend to the neck area? Thanks!!"
5,jatm516,"October 16, 2017",1,"Needs to be updated There is a bug in this version (2.2.0) that will not let you select a picture. It tells you to go authorize access to photos in settings/Microsoft selphie, but that is not an available option. "
6,Luke J J,"July 13, 2016",4,"Microsoft Strikes Again I appreciate that Microsoft is really trying to develop a lot of apps for iOS. They have really upped their game with apps for Office 365, but they also have simple apps like this. I appreciate that this is a very simple selfie app. No bells and whistles. It just takes selfies and then tries to smooth out any minor skin issues. (If you need a full-functioned photo editor, go with something like Google's Snapseed. This is not it.) Keep up the good work, Microsoft!"
7,BeginnerLL,"September 24, 2017",4,"iPhone update struggles I love this app and use it to quickly edit my photos; however, the app seems to be struggling with the new iPhone update. It tells me I need to give access to my photo library, but under settings that option isn‚Äôt even available for their app. Not to mention, I‚Äôm able to open my photo library in the app, it just won‚Äôt let me select a picture."
8,AmyRene22,"September 24, 2017",2,"Please fix iOS 11 photo issue. Before updating to iOS 11 Microsoft Selfie was my favorite photo editing app. I NEVER take a photo in the app, only use it to edit apps from my camera roll, but after updating to iOS 11 I can no longer access photos from my camera roll. It gives a pop-up ‚ÄúGo to Settings > Microsoft Selfie > Photos‚Äù to give app permission to access photos except there‚Äôs no photo option there! Only camera. So please Microsoft correct this issue so my review can go from two to five stars."
9,Red_riding_hood,"October 23, 2017",3,"Doesn‚Äôt Work With iOS11 I used to love this app. But since the iOS11 update, can‚Äôt give the app access to photos anymore. It says to enable access in Settings, but no such settings exist in new iOS update. I‚Äôm very disappointed. I realize this is probably Apple‚Äôs fault, and I‚Äôve contacted them about it already (to no avail). But I wish Microsoft app developers would put a little pressure on Apple as well, or at least configure a way around this problem."
10,Jbellmorgan,"January 4, 2017",5,"So easy, fantasy results Make any picture look great with this simple app! And those pictures you took in the past that didn't turn out right- this app fixes those! So happy with this app! Thanks MICROSOFT!"
11,SimonKuz104,"April 19, 2017",5,"Better Than You Think I first thought this app would be pointless, but I still decided to try it. I made the right choice this make photos look so much better. If you like to take pictures I definitely recommend this app."
12,Chord of Death,"October 3, 2017",5,Great app needs update or else useless now Needs to support new version for the IPhone. Needs settings for photo privileges for the App. Right now you have to point and shoot with the app. It was working awesome until now.
13,Meeeebeeee,"October 5, 2017",5,"Please update !! This is my go-to app for editing pics but like many of the other reviewers, I cannot edit existing pictures w. giving the app permission, but that is nowhere to be found."
14,theblkbarbie,"October 11, 2017",5,iOS 11 update issue I can‚Äôt access it due to the recent update just like the other reviewers and I‚Äôm terribly upset please fix this issue otherwise your app is 5 stars in my book !!!!
15,Deesse11111,"October 12, 2017",1,"Please fix this! This used to be my favorite app for quick edits. Now I cannot open an existing photo in the app, there‚Äôs no option to give it permission in settings. Okay, fine, I snapped a few pics using the app and did the edits there. Saves to camera roll fine. BUT when I try to edit this pictures later in the photos app (specifically crop them), the photos app crashes! This only happens in photos taken with Microsoft Selfie."
16,Snowberry0710,"October 12, 2017",2,"No longer works with iOS 11 I used to love this app but since updating my iPhone to iOS 11 I am no longer able to edit photos stored in my phone‚Äôs gallery. As others have said, this option is not even available to enable in settings, though the app prompts you to do so. Very disappointing and frustrating. Please fix this problem so I can give this app 5 stars!"
17,ili3276,"October 22, 2017",2,I used to LOVE this app For some reason the app no longer works properly on my iphone8 . Unless I take the picture from this app it won‚Äôt let me pick the photos on my album. It prompts me to go to my settings and give it permission... would love to if it was a feature on this app. *major side eye*  IF there is a fix for this- would be interested in troubleshooting.
18,Andy grasta,"October 26, 2017",5,"iOS 11 compatible How about you guys make the ability to take full pictures ?? Why the square frame of the camera ? Also, how about a night mode ?"
19,slschmidt76,"April 4, 2019",5,Love this!! This is by far the best selfie app I‚Äôve used. It just works. I don‚Äôt have to do a bunch of different things to make the photo look great. It just does! Live the ease of use and how my photos look. Only app I use anymore.
20,BlueSun27,"September 23, 2017",3,"V2.2.0 doesn‚Äôt work on iOS 11 Doesn‚Äôt have permission to access your photos on iOS 11.  You can take photos in it and then edit it, but if you want to edit existing photos... kinda useless.  It‚Äôs an easy fix... so...just waiting for Microsoft to fix what was previously a great app."
21,Rene' iTouch,"September 23, 2017",1,"Not working w/ iOS11 I loved this app until the new iOS11 was installed. It works when taking pics, but doesn‚Äôt when you ‚ÄúSelect Photo‚Äù. When you select photo, you get a window stating that I have to give permission to access to my photo library in my settings. ‚ÄúSettings >Microsoft Selfie> Photos‚Äù.  This setting doesn‚Äôt exist in iOS11!!  Microsoft has to update this app in order to work."
22,BeBrittFit,"September 27, 2017",5,"iOS 11 non functional 5 stars because I love this app for editing existing pictures, but it hasn‚Äôt worked since I upgraded to ios11, please fix!"
23,Glazoore,"October 2, 2017",3,Great but.. Update: Love this app but .. when I try to add a pic it says to go to settings and allow to access photos. But then in iPhone settings for this app there‚Äôs no option for that. Only to access camera. All of this was after the update. Please fix!!
24,ÿ¢ÿ™ÿ±ŸäŸÉÿ≥,"October 15, 2017",5,update for ios 11 Hello. Why is not ios11 able to add photos from my gallery? Only photos taken with the program can be edited.
25,Crimes12,"October 17, 2017",2,"Read/write access disabled Following upgrade to iOS 11, the app no longer has the necessary read/write access required to access photos from the camera roll. App functions only as a camera alternative at present. Still waiting for an update to address the issue."
26,Branjopa,"October 17, 2017",2,"iO11 Bug Since the update to iOS11 this app can no longer successfully process the permissions to access photos from the camera roll. Like most people, I only edit photos with this app, I rarely take photos with it. Until this bug is fixed this app is unfortunately useless to me. Please fix, this was one of my favorite apps!"
27,Mr.Coconut luver,"October 22, 2017",2,"Loved the app, but I can‚Äôt use it anymore I really liked the features the app offered, but now, after years of use, it suddenly tells me I need to give the app access to my photos when that is literally not an option in my settings. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because of Apple‚Äôs update or what, but I‚Äôm frustrated."
28,Shreejit Sugathan,"December 5, 2017",3,Good app needs updates This is a good app but should be consistently updated to keep in track with other apps in the iOS ecosystem with latest filters and effects.
29,negar.v,"July 15, 2018",5,"The most usable and the best selfie app! I gotta say this is one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had with an app which I recommend to everyone! Easy, professional and efficient! Good job Microsoftüëçüèª"

32,HoneyK_,"September 28, 2017",4,One of my favorite camera app Since upgrading to the 8 plus. I‚Äôm having a difficult time selecting pictures to change the filter. Can someone please help.
33,BGreen1908,"September 30, 2017",2,"Please Fix! I loved this app. However, since getting the  updated iOS, it keeps asking me to give the app permission to access my photos in setting. But when I go to settings for the app, that isn‚Äôt an option. "
34,Em87b,"October 1, 2017",1,FIX THE ISO 11 Glitch I‚Äôm an completely dumbfounded as to why it is taking so long to fix this glitch after so many reports. The edit doesn‚Äôt always work or happen when you take a pic with the app and now we can‚Äôt edit pic in our library because there is no way to give permissions ... I see ratings tanking and no response from the company
35,sockbun,"October 5, 2017",3,"Fix it please! Love this app but with the new OS update you can‚Äôt edit photos from the camera roll. Under settings, there‚Äôs no option to give it permission to access pictures, only to save them."
36,Mdk2k4,"October 9, 2017",1,"No good after ios 11.0 update Have not been able to use it with camera roll pictures, error comes on to give permission to microsoft selfie in general/microsoft selfie/camera roll, even after giving permission is not allowing to browse camera roll pics, so I guess is goodbye to Mictosoft selfie,all good things always come to an end."
37,Womaninred80,"October 21, 2017",1,"What happened?? I used to LOVE this app for its ability to improve pictures, but since the iOS 11.0.3 update, it will not access my photos. It tells me I have to go into settings, Microsoft Selfie, photos to grant permission for access, but there is no ‚Äúphotos‚Äù in the permission area. Please update and fix because this app is worthless to me as is."
38,Guardiangell,"October 23, 2017",2,"Doesn‚Äôt allow you to select a photo anymore With the new update, it doesn‚Äôt allow you to select a photo anymore! And it‚Äôs too slow to use if you want to take a photo with the app... please fix it! This used to be my go-to app and now I am about to delete it! Please update soon!!!"
39,Shgcccnnxsfjhxhdxjxxkgz,"October 23, 2017",3,Loved it until recent changes I loved this app until recently. It currently won‚Äôt allow me to access my photos through the app; the option isn‚Äôt there in my Settings on iPhone.

44,Rmmc07,"October 7, 2017",2,Bug fix needed for ios 11 It can‚Äôt access my photo album anymore and therefore can‚Äôt edit the photo.  Keeps asking for me to go to settings/selfie/ photos and allow. But that‚Äôs not there.  Worked great till I upgraded to 11
45,Journeyled,"October 7, 2017",3,"Update your application Since iPhones are now on 11, your application is not allowed to access the iPhone's photos.  Prior to 11, we used it a lot to edit photos.  But no longer."
46,Bigmicman,"October 12, 2017",1,Does not work I downloaded it because a friend likes it but it never worked on my phone. Just says please allow access to your camera roll by going to settings however there is nothing in the settings to turn on... Waste of time
47,MFam4,"October 12, 2017",2,Can not access my photos Worked beautifully before iOS 11. Now I keep getting a window to go to Settings‚û°Ô∏èMicrosoft Selfie‚û°Ô∏èPhotos to allow access. Unable to do that. Please fix. Have had this app for 2+years and love it!

Then IOS made an update in September and completely stopped worked - can‚Äôt upload pictures as there is an error message and no way to fix in settings. Apparently the developers have given up on this app and have no reason to make an update.
49,kellykellykellllly,"March 4, 2019",4,"Why does it mute my phone? I adore this app for the smoothing effects, but it always mutes my phone when I use it, which is irritating."
50,Jase1125,"March 3, 2017",3,"Excellent No other selfie app comes close. This automagically does the same thing that photographers do - hiding blemishes, evening skin tones, etc.  one negative - it doesn't save full resolution images. That is disappointing."

120,Momsantana,"January 11, 2016",2,"unfinished. lacks support for brown faces. this app works like a very early beta that shouldn't be released to the public. I'm 19, and I have a pretty face. this thing airbrushes me to the point where it's comical: Google ""airbrushed Adam Sandler"" and you'll see what I mean. I also happen to be brown - on the lighter end of the spectrum, as far as brownness goes, but definitely not fair by white/""Caucasian"" measures. this app doesn't work with my skin tone. it lightens my face beyond recognition and leaves it unmatching with the rest of my body. your developers should be smart enough to know that paler face =/= better photo. basically, 90% of the photos I've tried look better before I run them through."
121,chia4855,"January 18, 2016",5,"Easy, Simple, and Effective This app is extremely user-friendly and it really does make your pictures more flattering! I think that the new icon is much more appealing to a general audience, but the previous icon was definitely more unique and memorable. Microsoft, I would recommend something that's unique and doesn't necessarily have a camera as the icon - that's old! The cute face was a refreshing change, but not good for everybody. A compromise??"

The default ""Natural"" filter works just like that app.  I appreciate that it also works on existing photos and not just new selfies.  Since I'm not sure if moreBeaute2 is supported/updated anymore, I appreciate having this as an alternative.  Thanks Microsoft!"

But in all serious, I really do like this app; as it makes my pictures look a lot better than before."
133,Tanyeahhh,"January 8, 2016",4,"Love it! Love this app! Curious as to why some pics in my photo album don't edit though. Only complaint/suggestion would be that the back button, after selecting a photo to edit in my album, would lead me back to the photo album rather than back to the ""take a pic, select a pic"" page. I would like to be able to view the photo in full so that I don't have to go all the way back to it. Just seems that would be the most efficient option."
134,Tony56813,"January 9, 2016",4,"PHENOMENAL APP...for my gf lol I really like this app, it cleans me up pretty well, a little bit too well. Sure my blemishes and stuff get taken off but so does a little of my facial hair??? Interesting feature, it makes me look like a baby lol. Would love to see a gender button maybe?? My gf's face looks more pretty with it, as if she had foundation. I however do not need that, and would like my facial hair back. AWESOME APP THOUGH KEEP THE UPDATES COMING!!!"
135,JosephHernandez,"January 17, 2016",5,I love the app but I don't like the new icon I really enjoyed the old icon for this app and it really made my apps looks great with that icon now this new icon looks like goggle I dislike this icon but in general the app is amazing  hopefully we can get more features like more filters and everything and another update icon for the app
136,summerGirl22,"January 18, 2016",5,"Great app! Miss the old icon Love this app. Best selfie enhancer! The old app icon was better though. It was cute and unique! And more relevant to a selfie app. The new one looks too much like every other photo app icon with a camera lens. I know the app is Microsoft, it's in the name, don't need the app icon to reflect this. Sorry but the new icon is generic and boring üëé"
137,Because I said so !!!,"January 26, 2016",5,Awesome app!!! I've been using the iPhone since they came out and this may be only the second or third time I've felt a review is worthwhile. 
138,Ei91788,"February 1, 2016",4,New icon is good That old icon with the person's face was annoying to see on my phone everyday. Thank you for changing it. 
139,oolgac,"May 29, 2016",4,Pretty good Works as you'd expect. Its a plain and simple selfie app with various filters. Has a light and dark theme mode for the app. Also has an option to turn off auto noise reduction. Can save and share photos to Facebook and other social networks. It could probably benefit from some more customization options for the photos.
140,RichieB07,"January 7, 2016",4,"Great start to a great app It basically is like the ""beautify"" setting on a lot of cameras, but this does it in a better way. The different filters, being able to adjust how intense you want it, and the overall job it does are amazing. If only it had 3D Touch support! And the ability to add more than one filter."
141,Ttytyyt,"January 8, 2016",4,"Good and needs improvement UI is clean and simple to use, but I would like to have the ability to set the opening page straight to the camera mode. Also I would like to have the option to use the volume button as the shutter button just like the default camera app"
142,B2468286838($&:7738:88183,"January 8, 2016",5,"Beautifully simple! This app doesn't have many features, just filters and exposure settings, but they make any picture look attractive, especially when you use the app multiple times for one picture."
143,~ilc~,"January 10, 2016",5,"Perfect! Very simple app, can touch up photos I wasn't able to do manually and generally doesn't look too airbrushed! It does have the option to tone down if you think the edit is too strong. It makes your photos look good, yet still very natural. I love it!"
144,Gaby alatorre,"January 10, 2016",5,"10/10 This app is so good! the only small problem is that when you click on a photo and you put pressure on it with the 3D touch , the app closes. All in all this app makes your photos look in a much better quality."
145,Jacy R.J.,"January 10, 2016",5,"So amazing!! This is super simple and easy to use! I love how it brightens your pictures up to make you look amazing, but it doesn't change TOO much and you can choose how much you want changed with a scale from 1-10. Anyway, amazing app and I'll be using it a lot! üòÑ"
146,Zamrano,"January 12, 2016",5,"So Good, It's like Magic Absolutely love this app... It clears alway all blemishes and airbrushes the pic to perfection! Best photo editor ever! Love the results, it's almost magical how the autocorrect nails it to perfection each time!!"
147,LilLaceyLace,"January 15, 2016",4,"Great! But... The app is actually really neat, it's almost like the perfect airbrush. It Also does wonders with Contrast and brightness."
148,BenTheJohnson,"January 15, 2016",5,"Good free app This app is really good at making you look perfect, for a free app. You should definitely try it, and if you think it looks too fake you can turn down or intensity. It's a very simple app, and only does one thing, but it does it pretty well."
149,____________brenda_______,"January 16, 2016",2,"I want the old icon back! I liked the old icon more. As for the performance of the app, it's nice. It makes people who are darker look airbrushed in an extremely obvious way. I would say I'm golden or honey colored, and I might be too dark to use this app. Also, I wish there would be an option to remove blemishes before the airbrushing takes place. I wanted to use this app because I do have skin problems, and it just blurs my acne. It's still so noticeable."
150,Guitarider17,"December 30, 2015",4,"Great for Simple Editing The app comes with 14 filters and allows you to either upload or take a photo, choose a filter, gauge the intensity and then save it back to our camera roll. Very simple for people who don't know how to utilize exposure/saturation/white balance etc."
151,Duhduh12345,"December 31, 2015",5,"Amazing and Works Perfectly! Pretty cool app that automatically adjusts the filters, lighting,etc to give you the best photo of your face. I'll be using this all the time, even downloaded for my wife too who's a selfie queen!"
152,Marcusmann1974,"December 31, 2015",5,"Phenomenal app I've used this app to clean up existing pictures from a recent NYC visit.  This app makes pics on the iPhone look fantastic - I can't believe it's a free app!!  Try it, you will love what it does to your pictures."
153,Jack the beaver,"January 11, 2016",5,Simply Amazing This is a perfect example of an app done right. Microsoft Selfie give you quick access to filters that make you look great even on your worst days. It's now my go-to app when taking a self-portrait. Awesome
154,DaniDicko,"January 12, 2016",1,"This is glorified filters This does quite literally nothing that hundreds, if not thousands, of other apps do. It is glorified filter application and insane uncontrolled editing. Sure, you can change the strength of the editing, but it takes away everything that makes someone human (the little lines, small scars, freckles...). After trying a few pictures, I promptly deleted. If I wanted to look like a robot, there are better options."
155,Mozzz,"January 13, 2016",3,"Decent Fairly simple app which works well for cleaning up skin blemishes and decent filters, but for some reason my photos are reverse image and there is no setting to change that. "
156,Terryannt,"January 17, 2016",5,"Best selfie app! I'm not really one to take selfies, but if I do, it's nice to have this app to use. You can just a bit of effect or go all out but even then it's not over the top. I like how you can also edit photos you've already taken."
157,brandonhoran,"January 18, 2016",5,"BEST SELFIE CAMERA! If I'm needing my front facing camera for a selfie, I go to this app first. If I ever forget, I upload a selfie from within the app to adjust. Even when I have morning face, it makes me look like a million bucks. So you should get it. I promise you, it's THE BEST!!!!"
158,dat_derpy_girl,"January 29, 2016",4,icon üò©üò©üò© Youre honestly crazy if you think im updating the app for that ugly icon. It just looks so generic now.

163,Sree53,"January 1, 2016",5,Too good!! This app has an amazing auto noise reduction picture. All the other filters are better than what you get with iOS. Finally another amazing app from Microsoft. Great work guys!!
164,PassingNotes,"January 3, 2016",5,would love integration with Photos app perfect except for that I can't add as an option in edit directly from photos - that would make it much more useful
165,BigRedFTW,"January 8, 2016",5,"So simple I can't believe it Unlike perfect365 and some of the other apps I've tried, this app works seamlessly - take the picture and it does all of the work for you. Pretty awesome!"
166,Francescalombardo,"January 10, 2016",4,"AWESOME Genuinely works well. The only problem is on some photos, it may not work or all it will do is make the picture blurry. But for most it really has a positive effect! I would definitely get this app for little (or big) tweaks  here and there!"

168,andreweller,"January 26, 2016",5,"Cool app, new icon is worse than old one The current icon with the windows color and camera lens is boring. The older icon was nicer and I liked the interactive nature at the launch screen. "
169,Lindsd04,"March 9, 2016",3,Great app but needs bug fix Really liked the app when I first downloaded it but they need to fix the bug that stopped camera roll photo improvement. Especially because taking a photo from the app is not always possible or easy.
170,Jiuhtghbf,"December 30, 2015",2,"Where did my freckles go?! This makes me look so fake. It's great at removing blemishes, but in the process it gets rid of my freckles. Sad, since that's my favorite part of myself. The face becomes very smooth, like a doll. The filters are too intense though and distorts the color. Instagram is a much better option if you're looking for a filter."
171,imohammedf,"December 31, 2015",5,"Great I really like this app on iphone, it is like the photographing system in the LGs' phones, so now I can use this system on my iphone without going back to my LG phone."

177,Emadpres,"January 17, 2016",4,Almost perfect except new icon Perfect app with simple user interface. I keep one star because of new microsoft-like icon instead of previous cute and outstanding icon. New icon is so generic and nothing is especial and nice about it !

274,cockyjeremy,"January 8, 2016",1,"Not good The only thing I've noticed this app seems to do (on every single picture), it's turn the skin softening up way too high. That's it. No idea why the ratings are so high for this app."
275,Myd2011,"January 9, 2016",3,"Simple and good Good and simple app. Has a flaw where the final selfie picture is not reversed, so e.g. the letters on your t-shirt would be reversed. Also, please add timer."

Honestly, the only thing I think is missing is some sort of timer. How about something around 5 or 10 seconds? Still, definitely a great app for being free to download and use which should be noted since alot of people nowadays believe others should spend hours of their lives writing code and give it to them for nothing. Thank you MS."
