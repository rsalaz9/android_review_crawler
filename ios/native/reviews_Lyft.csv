0,serenityblue,"June 30, 2019",2,"Misleading, messy and causes me to be late for work When I got a Lyft and the driver’s car smelled absolutely disgusting, like vomit, I reached out to customer service to ask for a refund. It’s been almost a week and no one has gotten back to me. It’s also ridiculous that there is no public number or email to reach out to. You can only get help through the app and then you have to answer questions about your problem so you can be directed to an FAQ kind of answer. You’d have to click a vague option to get directed to a page where you can write to customer service. But then you’ll probably never hear back. "
1,D o n n a,"June 3, 2019",5,"Your App Your app is not user-friendly. This is the first time I have it used Lyft. Trying to navigate to scheduling a ride ahead of time was cumbersome. I had to Google how to do it since it wasn’t apparent.  Also, after I finally was able to get that done, there was nowhere that I could find to confirm that it went through. I went to your help section and emailed you regarding this and ask for a response to confirm. First of all in your drop-down menus which I had to pick a selection from each, there was one section that did not cover what I was writing you about. Number two I never have gotten a response from that email. I would suggest that you have a chat section so questions can be answered right away. My driver was great, but your app leaves a lot to be desired. I would like to see an apparent place that you can easily schedule ahead of time. When I googled, it told me to look for a little clock. There was no little clock on my app. I had to Google even further to eventually find out how to navigate to selecting a future time. I am hoping that you deal with these issues to make it easier to schedule with you. Uber has it all over you as far as ease-of-use on the app. I don’t want to be insulting, but I would like to use Lyft more. Please improve your app."
2,sunte34,"December 9, 2019",2,"Lyft pink pass Please no one should fall for this scam this is not a deal lyft advertises that the lyft pass offer deals and 15% on unlimited rides. My fare price for 20mi is at max 28 dollars with heavy traffic and bad weather conditions. Now since I signed up for the lyft pass I received a 15% discount on only two of my rides. After those two trips the base price of my regular ride I use to commute to and from work only spiked up to 34 to 44 Dollars. I called and explained to lyft on how can my base price rise so high if all of my ride history for months never were that price ,now that I’m a lyft pink pass member. There explanation was that at that time the rate for drivers and rides were higher so I gave it a chance to see if they’re telling the truth or robbing customers money. I come to find out lyft did lie to me I’ve been checking every hr for two days now and my base price still is over 34$ there’s absolutely no way that the demands are high that it’s being calculated correctly. I canceled my ride pass and my base price is now back at 28$ at max fare. This is a complete scam and false advertisement. If you sign up for the lyft pass you will not be saving money that’s for sure all they’re going to do is raise the base price you were paying so you’ll still be paying the same price as before except your giving them a extra twenty dollars a month to do it. I hope that a law firm adds how much money is being stolen from customers and sues lyft for what they’re doing."
3,My5t1c_tac0,"August 29, 2019",5,"Love Drivers, Hate Algos I take a Lyft almost every day and all over the country.  Lyft is far and away a more responsible choice than Uber.  They treat the drivers better, take their safety concerns seriously, and reward them for providing a good customer experience.  Women drivers I’ve talked to overwhelmingly prefer it."
4,durph22,"October 20, 2018",5,"Used to be better I don’t know what’s been going on with this app, but it has been absolutely frustrating and getting worse. Today I requested a pickup, and automatically it asks if I want to be picked up at work (I’m assuming because I request there a lot), but today I was a few blocks away so I had to adjust where I wanted to be picked up. I set my current location as pickup and confirmed it. I got a notification when the driver was a minute away, I check the app, and he’s at my work. The place I made sure it wasn’t set to pick me up. So I cancelled the ride, asked for the $5 cancellation fee to be reversed, and tried again. I TRIPLE checked that my location was set probably and yet, the driver was set to pick me up at work, the wrong location. This time however, I clicked “edit pickup” and dragged the curser directly over my location, DIRECTLY, over it, clicked confirm and suddenly the cursor automatically moves a block away from where I placed it and then won’t let me change again. So I had to call my driver and give him my own directions to find me. My 10 minute trip quickly turned into much longer. I never had these experiences with Lyft before but recently they’ve been happening so often it might just be worth it to take the bus."
5,shivashivs,"November 11, 2019",1,"Non existent customer service I have used Lyft for years and in different countries and I honestly say that had the web got bigger the quality got so much worse . It’s like anyone can be a driver but no upkeep or checks are done . They can come smelling of weed or just dirty , speak to you however they want , be incredibly rude , txt driving . And the customer has no way of reporting it coz there like 3 auto responses available to contact you. Drivers cancel out rides on purpose or like one I m on right now didn’t stop at my location and will activate “ your ride is here timer “ before even stopping the car. I literally was sitting in my drive way and saw him pass by. When I called him , he didn’t want to drive back even tho he’s the one that didn’t stop at the right place . Last week your driver was so rude I refused to get in the car . He held my ride for 47 mins . I was trapped . Coz he didn’t want to cancel and I didn’t think it was right for me to do so. I have lost count of how many time the driver didn’t speak English to the point of not understanding left and right . Bottom line is you take our money and leave us with the rudest,  unprofessional drivers and give us close to no option to communicate with you. And if god forbid we want to cancel coz of one of these situations , we are charged. You figured out the algorithm into my bank account , but clearly have very long way to go with basic manners and customer service from both your drivers and your general services."
6,Farishtaaaaaa,"October 25, 2019",1,Fraud I normally use Uber. I trust Uber more than Lyft. One of my sister is using Lyft since 1 year and she’s fine. Yesterday I had a dentist and took off wisdom teeth after a while I downloaded the Lyft app and I made account then I booked a ride for $7.58 from dentist to my work it was a very important to get to my work before afternoon. I had to submit some important information to HR. I booked the ride and they gave me an stupid driver who was totally over than retirement age even though he’s supposed to drive deaf man.  After standing for 15-20 minutes the app shows he’s arrived and they were asking to look for gray ford 2011 David name old man. Tell me one thing how could I get to him when there was a parking lot and there was already all parked cars no one came there with Lyft tag on their front. I called the driver 4-6 times 3 times he picked up and just said HELLO and he hanged up. He did the same for 3 times after that he dropped my calls n didn’t replied my msg I send him that I’m in front of densit hospital where are you. Then he just maked 5 minutes and he left me there without replying without responding to my calls. In few seconds I booked another ride they charged me the fee without ride without getting me to my destination. It was a 100 times hate and regret for me why even I made the Lyft I hate it . Now I’m sending this review and their system isn’t allowing me they’re asking for nickname I tried 7 nickname they’re rejecting.. why? Bcz they’re scammers
7,SpANKY050,"February 4, 2020",4,Drivers Absolutely love using this app . The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the different types of drivers . Granted majority of the time I get great drivers . I’ve been using this app on and off for 3 years now . In the 3 years I’ve used this app I’ve come across 4-5 horrible drivers . I feel as though hygiene should b a MuST ! I got a driver today who was of the Indian culture and did not have any type of fragrance or deodorant on . I understand for some types of religion it’s a no no . But if your job requires you to interact with the public in a commercial capacity you should at the very least wear deodorant or powder . Something to mask the HORRIBLE smell !!! Other than that it’s a solid 4 star for me . They usually pick you up right at the location you put in. I would suggest the engineers or whoever to fix the location services . I have used just my location at times instead of typing in the adress to where I am located and 6 times so far I’ve been picked up in the wrong location . Aka up the block or up the block and across the street . Across the highway . So that part is bad . Other then those 2 issues and the fact that the drivers are people and have “ mood swings” I have no complaints . It’s a relatively good app all around.
8,kwadublin,"January 17, 2019",5,"Need an easier way to get receipts for expense reporting Been using Lyft for a while when it became my company’s preferred ride share provider.  The service itself has been great. My gripe is the receipts you get. The email receipts you send after a ride are totally useless for expense reporting. The format you use doesn’t allow the payment info to print on the page.  I even tried landscape mode and it still doesn’t work.  You have a zillion business users.  We need to attach receipts to expense reports electronically.  PDF versions that are concise and under one page are what we need.  As it is now, I’m forced to snap a photo/JPG on my phone and then convert it to PDF and then email it to myself. That’s nuts!  The email you send takes 3 pages to print, and even then, the format doesn’t have the expense info on it because of the crazy formatting you use.  I tried going to my account on your website and there is no ride history data to allow you to get a receipt there.  You guys really put no thought into making this easy for business users.  If I have to keep doing this I will probably just go back to Uber simply to get receipts easier. I’d gladly talk to anyone there about this.  Thanks."
9,dntrcjjfil,"June 26, 2019",4,"Don’t trust current location. Several times lately I’ve found that if I didn’t specify where I was by entering an address the Lyft driver could not find me. I asked a Lyft driver, who had grown up in Seattle what the problem was. He suggested I always enter an exact address, even if I had to look it up in advance. I did that this morning and tonight and had a better experience. If we add inexperienced drivers in a location to the problem of the satellite location you can be texting with a driver who is on the other side of the block and doesn’t understand you are waiting at the front door of the hall “Town Hall” Seattle, Wa. Not only that but this morning I entered an address where I was at a diner and the program auto changed it to Coleman Dock 2-3 blocks away. What gives?  I am writing on my husbands phone. I’m Dusty Collings. We are traveling together and we take turns calling Lyft. I think, & hope you can make some refinements to the experience. I don’t like having to pay for a driver who is in the wrong location and doesn’t want to drive around the block to pick me up. It wasn’t my fault and I had to pay the fee for standing him up. Not really fair. I have a walking disability and I try limit the number of steps I take. Thanks."
10,Than Davenport,"August 4, 2018",3,"Order process more confusing I’ve been using Lyft for about 2 years now and it’s a fantastic service. The latest update has done wonders for the graphic identity of the brand and it looks especially good on my iPhone X, they’ve done a good job of integrating the notch into the design that makes the whole app feel purposeful and user friendly. One thing they changed, however, and have made much worse in my opinion. They changed the order sequence from ~dropoff lovation>pickup location>size select and confirmation~ to ~dropoff location>size select>pickup location and confirmation~ this has made the buying order process much more confusing even for an experienced Lyft rider. The final order screen should always have the approximate dropoff time and the expected cost on it, in my opinion. With the latest update the final order screen simply asks you where you’d like to be picked up and honestly this makes no sense to me. The last purple button before you’re charged doesn’t even say “order Lyft” it just says “confirm pickup” which has led me to accidentally order a Lyft when all I wanted to do was check approximate times and charges for a Lyft I would be taking later in the day. I think if this aspect were changed it would round out the app perfectly and make it deserving of 5 stars."
11,Runnerguy45,"August 6, 2018",2,"Future Rides Have clear instructions and work flow for customers trying to schedule future rides. Honestly, it used to much easier to request a lyft for a future date. With the current home screen and user face, it’s hard to see the “schedule” touch point and doesn’t flow well at all. When I’m scheduling a future ride, I want to make that clear first thing, up front, immediately...not be lead on a scheme to accidentally request a ride for “right now” and have to pay cancellation charges. It makes lyft appear a bit shady. Uber has that title. Please revert to customer friendly, simple app services and not try to trick anyone into anything...I use lyft bc I trust it more than Uber. That trust has severely wavered with this recent update. Also a huge downfall: not having an immediately accessible service team. I needed help bc my app updated in the middle of scheduling my ride to the airport 24hrs in advance and, again, I could’t figure out how to request future ride in new update. It was imperative and down to the wire for me to request lyft and the time kept creeping forward (it wasn’t allowing me to request my trip any sooner than exactly 24hrs in advance somehow). I tried to talk to someone at lyft to no avail. I am a loyal customer and hope this message is heard! Otherwise back to old school taxis and I am your target market millenial!"
12,fulltime Uber Driver,"September 25, 2018",5,"Cheap Rides for Drivers and Terrible Customer Service!!! I’m a Lyft and Uber Driver for one year now. At the normal rate, Lyft pays Drivers a hair more than Uber. There is hardly any Primetime and when there is, it’s at a very low percentage except when there is extremely inclement weather. As a full time driver driving for both Companies, the only way to make a profit is through Primetime and Surge, period. A good example of how cheap the driver pay is from Lyft is earlier this week they had an available scheduled ride to take someone from Englewood Cliffs, NJ to Philly, PA for a payment between $101 and $111-that is offensive and highway robbery. That’s clearly a loss to any driver. By the time you factor in tolls, gas, wear and tear on your car and time spent not being able to pick up in PA until you hit NJ, it’s def not worth it. Their customer service is the worst, period. They outsource to the Philippines and they are ALL trained to be very polite but that’s it-no knowledge to assist you. Their scheduled rides are not guaranteed so although you are the “designated” driver, you are NOT guaranteed to get the passenger-outrageous! I hardly turn on my Lyft App and instead drive for Uber more which I might add isn’t much better."
13,fvsclothing,"February 26, 2019",1,"Before choosing this app you should know how awful the drivers are treated! This company has no respect for the drivers they will steal from you every chance they get via cancellation fees and app payment issues etc. when you call to rectify the situation they disrespect and talk down to you in hopes that you will lose your temper so they can disconnect the call. If you don’t lose your cool they leave you on hold for as long as it takes for you to hang up so you don’t receive a survey not that responding to the survey makes any difference...in my case I stayed on hold for 4 hours!!. Lyft is by far the most ghetto trashy ride share company out there. I can’t believe they want to go public with the type of unsolved issues they have with their operation. They expect drivers to give 5 star service to passengers which I do while providing less than 1 star service to drivers in return. They don’t even have a working telephone number, they make it extremely difficult to speak with anyone unless you write an email which they selectively respond to if you are lucky. They know most drivers that work for them don’t have many other options so they exploit that to the fullest. I done nearly 4000 rides in only a year of working for them all while maintaining a 5 star rating but this means nothing to them you don’t even get a bonus, thank you, or even a thumbs up emoji. What a sad company."
14,tgb35545864588,"March 21, 2019",1,"Rip off! Lyft no showed me twice in the same day. Each time I was outside waiting watching the app and how close the drivers were to me. Twice they came within 6 blocks from me and then the app stopped the drivers eta and routed me brand new drivers. Both times they started my arrival times all over while I was waiting outside( somewhat cold out). I’ve used the Lyft app for about a year. In that year I’ve missed my driver outside maybe 2-3 times. All times I was charged a $5.00 cancellation fee which seemed fair being I wasn’t outside when they arrived( they left). Now why on earth can the Lyft drivers then no show me and they don’t hold there drivers to the same standards they hold there customers to. My time is just as valuable as theirs. But apparently Lyft didn’t think so. I wasn’t given the 2 no show cancellation credits when they did it to me. Seems unreasonable that they can charge the customer a $5 dollar cancellation fee but we can’t get that same credit when they no show us. I’ll never use Lyft again. They wouldn’t even make it right either, instead they acknowledged the wrong and basically kept asking me the same thing over and over and over. Basically wanting me to just go away. I could care less about the money but it’s the principle. I’m a business owner and I can’t get away with screwing my customers over the way these guys do. Oh well I guess. I just downloaded the Uber app. Bye Lyft!"
15,Sirrbenson23,"January 23, 2020",1,"Great experience until........ I’d like to go and say that I was a huge fan of this app. So much so I barely walked anywhere or took the bus seeing how I’m 18 and a car is in my agenda at the moment. I lyft’d almost everyday to work for the inexpensive price of 11$ to get to and from work. Until one day I ordered a lyft 20 minutes ahead of my expected appearance at work seeing how the ride was about 6 minutes and this was a very very rare occasion because I would order 10 minutes ahead. So I get a driver and he approaches my home. For some reason my driver switches to someone further than the previous. This all happens in a 5 minute span so I don’t worry. I look at my phone and the driver is not moving at all. This happens for 10 minutes. My driver. Not moving an inch. So I decide to cancel the ride and just walk seeing how I’m already running a little behind and a lyft at this point would be wasting money. I soon see that cancelling costs 5$ which is around the price of my normal ride. So I expected a refund and to be short a dollar in this inconvenience. Nope 12 wasted on a lyft I didn’t even take. The app has the gull to have one of the refund options say “driver isn’t moving” while simultaneously saying they have driver their way to me so pay 5$. Morale I’d say is to not rely on lyft for work. Bite the bullet and take reliable routes for work, school, etc. leave the lyft rides for something more lenient."
16,SashaMonet,"March 2, 2020",1,"STOP USING LYFT ALL TOGETHER I have never experienced anything like this.I was almost about to be late to my job and I can’t be late so, I decided to call a lyft, everything went well I see my driver coming close so I wait outside, but he just kept going straight instead of turning, so I seen that he kept going straight and I called him, and he declined it. I thought he probably got turned around and had the wrong address so I called again, declined again, then I said to myself okay if he doesn’t turn around right here somethings up, he kept going, so I couldn’t cancel or else I would be charged and they didn’t reroute me until he was 8 minutes away from me, they rerouted me and the next driver was 20 minutes away finishing up a current ride, something has to be done because there wasn’t anywhere that I could go to on the lyft app to report that my driver wasn’t going the right way so I could get a new driver, which made me extremely late, I have the drivers number but not his profile picture :( The service is bad I try to report something but there isn’t a place for the report that I’m trying to do, my bank statement came in and it showed this I know charges with the same number as the lyfts item number thing and it won’t let me delete my card and then you have to email which take forever to respond, you don’t even get to talk to an actual person🤦🏾‍♀️NEVER USING LYFT AGAIN"
17,Lang99,"July 12, 2019",1,"Might as well go to Urber Honestly every rider has their own experiences so this is mine. I live in a brand new neighborhood that hasn’t quite made it on the gps yet so I understand it can get a little complicated. I make sure to leave a note or call the driver to let them know it’s the next neighborhood over and I even order my Lyft almost two hours before work just in case something happens you know? Well something happened. The driver Jogander read my pick up note and still didn’t follow it (annoying but understandable no harm done) so I call him and I’m literally on the phone for about five minutes explaining to him what to do (leave that neighborhood, take a right and just drive down till you see my neighborhood name. Simple right?) So he tells me he’s on his way and I’m waiting on this man not knowing nor getting a notification that he CANCELED and I was still charged a cancellation fee. So not only have I wasted time waiting for a ride that wasn’t even coming I’m also running late to work. I contact customer care and they refund me the fee but when I asked if they at least contact the driver or something for lying they hit me with the whole “well we refunded you isn’t that enough” bull crap. Honestly Lyft is still a type of job so employees need to be held accountable I’m going straight back to urber. It may cost me a few dollars more but they haven’t pulled this bs with me (yet)."
18,GAC79145,"June 22, 2019",5,Lyft should give bonuses to their perfect drivers I have used Lyft & Uber and I can easily say I will never use Uber again not because the drivers are terrible but because the UBER platform is horrible. In fact I deleted that app because of poor customer service. 
19,Mrs_Nichs0122,"August 19, 2019",1,"Total ripoff of a company I had to fly into Minneapolis for military training. There are three of us from my unit back home and since we flew and don’t have cars, we decided to ride together for dinner. Our hotel is on base and right next to the airport. Our lyft driver picked us up from the gate in which we walked to on a sidewalk the whole time wearing shoes we unpacked from our bags. The drive was fine, so I was courteous and gave a tip. About an hour later, I get an email that I was being charged a damage fee of $25. They claimed they had proof of damage as shown by pictures of mud in the floorboard of the vehicle. The pictures did show such, but what the pictures didn’t show was a time and date the pictures were taken. In the email it said the pictures were time and date stamped, but when I asked for them to send those to me, all I got was that the evidence was there. Also, the so-called evidence in the picture showed the mud being dry, which is hard to believe it could be from us if the pictures were taken immediately after we got out as stated. I asked to speak to a supervisor and wasn’t granted that request either. This company is garbage and I will be taking my business elsewhere. It’s such a shame to be taken advantage of simply because we are from out of town and people think the military just has money to waste! Don’t let this company rip you off people!"
20,ArlenHills,"July 15, 2018",1,"Unreliable I waited over 30 minutes for the driver to “complete a trip” on the way to pick me up...at this point, the car started very slowly heading in my direction, and the arrival time kept going up the closer the driver got to where they were supposed to turn to pick me up, but then they passed my location and continued on, appearing to have no intention whatsoever of picking me up. I decided since I’d now been waiting 45 minutes and could have had a taxi pick me up faster, that I would go ahead and cancel and find a ride through someone other than Lyft. This would have been my 3rd time using Lyft and the other two times were slightly sketchy, in terms of creepy drivers. But since I had a 10% discount for having a 5 Star rating, I wanted to use Lyft anyway. I can tolerate weirdness to an extent...but not showing up when they agreed to pick me up is a deal breaker. So now my discount has expired and evidently they did me a big favor by not charging a cancellation fee??? If anything, I think the driver should have to pay me if they accepted my ride and completely blew me off. Sorry but if I’m told my ride will be there in 10 minutes and 45 minutes later, the driver is passing my pickup point without slowing down or any indication they’re coming back, etc...yeah I will cancel and use Uber or a taxi. And I expect to never be charged for canceling for such a reason."
21,fedup rider,"July 21, 2018",2,Drivers not picking up scheduled spot I have had many instances lately (most recently last night) that drivers hit the button that indicates they are at my identified pick up spot and in reality they are not AND I am being charged wait time.  This has become increasingly frustrating and in some instances when the driver wasn’t at the pick up and I called to question instead of trying to find me they just cancel my ride.   This puts me at the end of the que and I have to wait AGAIN for a ride.  The most recent ride that did this to me was last night when I scheduled a pickup and the driver (I only have his phone number because Lyft doesn’t leave me the information of drivers that cancel) couldn’t find my pickup location even though it was clear on the map where I was.  He wasn't at the pick up location but hit the button indicating he was so I called and he kept telling me he couldn’t get to the pick up spot when in fact there many cars driving past me.  I patiently waited and after I called him 2 times he canceled my ride.  I had to get another Lyft and wait another 18 minutes- after I had already waited for 15 minutes.   This is becoming common and will make me think twice before requesting a Lyft in the future- drivers can’t seem to read maps and understand directions.
22,FunniestWriterOnTheInternet,"November 6, 2018",1,"STUPID Cancellation Charge I hope the programmers find themselves in my situation one day. I’m currently standing out in the cold rain, I’m soaking wet and I’ve been working a long long day, and I now have to wait 15 minutes for my driver, and he just called and told me he’s going to stop for gas, so it will probably be more like 20 minutes until he even arrives. FURTHERMORE I can’t cancel the ride or I’ll be charged $10 and he can’t cancel the ride at all from his end. Whoever came up with this system is in contention to be one of the most exceedingly moronic idiots on the history of the planet. AND now another Lyft driver has literally pulled up to the curb I’m standing at, but I can’t ride with him because the app is SO unbelievably inflexible. So I’m here with a seemingly infinite amount of time to write a scathing review or your STUPID, useless app. It’s stupid and useless and also you should pay your drivers better. Do you have brains in your heads Lyft programmers? Do you hate your employees and customers? I’ll be deleting this app as soon as I finish this one last ride (if it ever happens) and I strongly urge you, dear reader, to do the same. Switch to Uber, or get a cab, or heck, you’re probably even better off walking if you have 20 minutes like I do. Thanks for reading folks and if you happen to be a Lyft programmer or exec, then please take my suggestion into consideration."
23,Ash Chaps,"January 12, 2019",5,"Do not pass GO! Collect lyft! Above all other ride services, I have to recommend Lyft! Prices are more reasonable, response is immediate and without a doubt, ALWAYS, within a reasonable time frame for pick up.  I have rarely had a snore personality driving me from point A to point B.  These people are kind, out going and all around cool.  This is a service industry job.  Please remember that. Whatever your reason for requiring a transport, remember that they are providing a needed service and while tipping isn’t required, I stress that you deliver it.  They have NO set income and provide you with a convenience you can’t find through public transportation. Take care of those who take care of you.  The universe reciprocates kindness in the least expected moments.  Also, Uber is a money hungry monster.  Lyft is a competitive career with so many people employing themselves through it. Remember remember remember! These people deserve a couple extra dollars for their hospitality. Be kind to others. Be true to others.  Be grateful for your advances.  And always share your love!  Hope this was helpful and encouraging! If not, here’s a get out of jail free card.  USE LYFT!"
24,Edmond Bear,"January 18, 2019",4,"First ride this morning I had breakfast and set up my first ride with Lyft. The system told me who my driver would be and that he was 10 minutes away. I was watching his progress and it kept telling me he was finishing up with a previous ride. I saw that he turned south onto Hefner Parkway and heading south. The arrival time kept getting longer. 13, 15, 17 minutes then I noticed he had gotten onto I-44 and was heading east. I texted the driver and let him know that I had a 9:30 Dr appt and as it was after 9:00 were we going to make it. He told me that the ride he had gave him the wrong address. He kept getting farther and farther away. Needless to say I was growing very unhappy with Lyft and had never encountered any problems with Uber. I canceled the ride and placed another order. It was 9:10. The lady that picked my up helped to ease my frustrations and made the ride to the Dr very enjoyable. I do not understand why the first driver couldn’t have texted me and let me know there was problem so I could ask for another driver. It all ended all right and I wasn’t late to the appt, 9:28. If he had only texted me, it would have saved a lot of frustration. I have used Lyft 3-4 more times today and everything went like clockwork."
25,miraftab,"February 27, 2019",1,"Very rude and unsafe drivers Driver didn’t finish the ride for me and forced me out of his car in heavy rain about 10 minutes away from my house. There was a very strong odor in the back seat where I was sitting. I nicely informed the driver that there is bad smell coming from the back seat just so he can take care for next passengers. He replied very rudely that I smell! I thought I didn’t hear him right so I said what do you mean? I didn’t say you smell, I just gave you a friendly feedback about your car. But he instead repeated what he said rudely and then asked me to shut up and instead lead him to my address! I got really offended by his action and didn’t feel safe at his car due to his aggression to the extent that I was about to call 911. I told him that my address is in your map and just follow the direction. He then asked me if I live in that area which I declined to answer. He then forced me out of his car in the heavy rain and incorrectly claimed that he has finished the ride. I was left stranded in the streets with luggage after having a very long flight. "
26,Chris cro,"March 11, 2019",1,"Great experiences until...... I have been using Lyft for a long time, it’s my preferred ride share service. Never had any issues, until one day I left my phone in one of the rides I took. After about 2 minutes, I realized what had happened, and there is a way to contact the driver for lost items, so I tried that route. The driver did not answer, and I know that his phone was on the dashboard for GPS use because I was in the front seat. So obviously he saw I was calling. After countless calls, voicemails, texts, and messages sent to Lyft corporate through the website help center I received no response. I was finally able to reach the driver after a full day, and it was extremely sketchy. He answered the phone and did not say anything for about 20 seconds. He said that he did not see it and he would check again and be in touch. Never heard from him after that. After hours of trying to reach the help center by phone, I was told the Lost and Found team does not have a phone line they can be reached at, and to fill out the form on the help center website. I had already done that numerous times, so by now I’ve lost all hope. Lyft customer service is an absolute nightmare, and I would highly encourage anyone to use Uber as I know they are making strides to improve their customer service, which is more than I can say for Lyft itself. Avoid at all costs."
27,BitterRice,"May 28, 2019",1,"Bye Lyft! App told me driver would be there in 2 minutes. Didn’t show up for at least 10. The ride cost $30 for a 7 mile ride. My destination was pretty much a straight line east. My estimated time of arrival at my destination was about 25 minutes according to the app. Driver tells me he has to pick someone up. Fine. Next thing I know, we’re headed north. Way way up north. Before long we are on a highway. Now we’ve traveled the same distance that should have gotten me home by now. I end up taking the grand tour of the Bronx which is no where near where I live. I live in Queens. The driver is then directed to take a major toll bridge to get into Queens. Finally 70 minutes after I ordered the Lyft I finally get dropped off at home. Oh and we never did pick up anyone. What a waste of time and money. Do I blame the driver? Absolutely not. It was the Lyft GPS that directed him to take the longest, most round-about route possible. When I reach out to customer service what do they do? Give me a $5 credit that expires within a week or so and scold me for picking a pooled ride. In a very condescending tone this service rep reminded me that the best way to avoid my experience was to order the deluxe ride next time. I’ve been using Lyft for over a year and always use it over Uber. That has now changed. I have deleted Lyft and will be giving Uber my business instead."

Now each time this has happened lyft was swift in refunding my money and generally send me an email of apology. I know not everyone’s perfect but they guys at lyft are always on point with any problems or concerns. I’ve had an incident where a driver tried to kiss me and was refunded the full amount along with an email. I’ve never had the app crash but I have heard there are problems from time to time. Guys I don’t care about that kind of problems because you’ll have that with any app or technology from time to time and as far as I’ve heard they fix it in a timely matter. So I can’t find one bad thing to say about lyft. Uber doesn’t take my debit card so they lost out on my business to lyft and I’m so glad I ended up here instead. There are promos that help from time to time and it’s very easy to contact lyft if I ever need to. Thanks guys for being on point with your customers.
29,KHucks,"September 23, 2019",4,"Nobody’s perfect but ANYTHING is better than Uber The title pretty much explains it all. I’ve been using Lyft since their cars were driving around San Diego with big pink furry mustaches on the grilles. Tourists always asking what’s with those cars? And I would be happy to explain and show them what Lyft was all about. People always comparing Uber and Lyft and always having SOOOO many horror stories about Uber and I would ask, “Why didn’t you use Lyft?” And the answer is always the same, to save a few bucks. Well I promise, especially in San Diego, Lyft is ALWAYS worth the extra dollar or two. Only reasons I didn’t rate five stars is because it seems Lyft isn’t being as picky about their drivers. I used to count on Lyft for always having native San Diegan’s for drivers, not so much anymore. I liked it a lot more when my drivers new the area and paid attention to the road, not their navigation app. Also, it doesn’t make a lot of sense that the price to get from Point Loma to Downtown has quadrupled in the last few years. I’m not exaggerating, I’ve checked my statements. After asking multiple drivers about this I feel it’s safe to say they have not gotten any raises. Reason for this?"
30,jazzOH,"November 24, 2017",1,"No CUSTOMER CARE, just rip off passengers & GO ! I have used LYFT off & on over a year now, originally they were my go to opposed to Uber because when I did have any issues w. a ride or driver I was always helped within a few hours (if that long). Lyft no longer has that human to human contact and sadly now I have received MULTIPLE (at least 8+) drivers who have PURPOSELY found ways to attempt to get paid through cancellation fees through this app. This was my last straw, I normally do not write reviews however I just witnessed my driver mark himself present in my location 2 mins prior to arriving then called him (because they never call you) and asked if it was an effort to get a cancellation fee for him to say un huh on the phone and cause me to be charged w. that exact fee .. which was more than the cost of the ride. Now I have to wait more than a day to receive that money back or contact my bank because Lyft no longer respects their consumer. SAVE YOUR TIME & YOUR MONEY! ! Find a ride sharing app that still has some sort of human contact or at least responses within an appropriate amount of time if their drivers are abusing their policies. They responded to this review and still haven’t responded to any of the 3 complaints I’ve had to file w. them in the past 2 weeks. 😭AGAIN, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR YOUR RIDE SHARING OR ONLINE RIDE REQUEST!"
31,Jasmine@23,"September 5, 2018",5,not up to date I dont know whats going on with lyft but the map that they use for gps is not up to date or maybe its their software. I live in a city  where there is 2 of the same streets in 2 different parts of town. so i get that part of the confusion but on my lyft app its says i am going to my correct location but on the drivers end it says im going across town. Thank God i have enough sense to  double check and guide the driver to my correct location. And get this this is not the first time this has happened  and yes i filed a complaint because the first incident was not pleasant. After not using the app for a while i decided i dont feel like taking the T home let me use lyft. They still did not solve this problem. And I know everyone in this area who uses them have this problem. I rather pay the extra money with Uber atleast they get the address correct ( which at one point they had the same problem but they corrected it). 2 stars from me and i will be deactivating lyft. so warning to everyone if you know where you going and you notice your not going in the right direction speak up.
32,DoItGurl,"September 6, 2018",5,"Newark, NJ Lyft experience I have had great experiences with Lyft which is why I still use the service. HOWEVER, this past weekend (Sept 1st-2nd), picking up from Newark Penn station changed that. None of the drivers shoulders up within the time the app stated. There were too many horrible drivers: poor attitudes, disrespectful, and not willing to follow the traffic light or the gps. Two drivers began cursing to show their anger—one because a light wouldn’t change fast enough, and he made a left turn on the red light with me and another passenger in the car (Viktor—LEKL70)! The other driver was cursing because she went to the wrong side to pick me up, disregarding where gps told her I was (Ufaefeea—K22KBY). She also was terribly rude, wouldn’t make an effort to come to me so I offered to walk to her and by the time I got to her, she hung up the phone and canceled the ride. Between 2:36PM and 2:55PM, I had 5 different driver changes/updates. Finally, Helen (U82-GZG) showed up and was a delight. Lyft, this is unacceptable. While there are taxis available and they are not better with price, [some of] their attitudes are and they are right there waiting."

34,tzajc,"November 8, 2018",1,"Application issues. For reference, this is a critique of the app itself, the drivers I have had were pleasant, efficient, and took the safety of everyone in high regard. As far as the app goes, in order to match one with a  driver faster, it often matches riders with drivers more than 10 minutes away, and may or may not match them with a different rider who’s closer, while this is something designed by all ride sharing apps, with Lyft the issue is unpredictability, resulting in riders waiting longer or shorter than expected, and are at a higher risk of losing rides. Furthermore, less than their competition, Lyft does not update for traffic issue as well, trips that were expected to be 15 minutes can take 40 minutes due to traffic. The final point of interest is in regards to location pin, whatever services Lyft uses to show where a rider is located often are farther off, and doesn’t take into account road structure: these last few trips, drivers have shown me that they were directed to the back of my apartment building, near the woods located nearby. With all these on s day to day consistent usage over these past few months as I’ve used the app, I have decided to discontinue my usage of Lyft. I appreciate the courtesy of your drivers, and wish you success with your goal of providing service of your customers-Tom."

Drivers can literally sit in there spot for what seems like hours when your waiting for a ride or even head the entire different direction! All the while Lyft still tells you the driver is 3 minutes away. After a 30 plus minute wait and multiple driver refreshes just let us request a new driver when they are obviously busy. It’s bogus when you have to take a $5 charge for someone who’s going to take 10 minutes to even leave the spot they are in. You’re nail biting every time you order one of these hoping you actually have a driver. My father had a situation where he scheduled a driver then come the next morning when the drivers supposed to arrive the app is looking for drivers and switching finally after about 15 minutes of a driver not moving. He missed his flight that day but I believe after contacting Lyft got credit towards his account. Cool they will do that but a $30 ride isn’t the price of a plane ticket. People aren’t dumb, we know when the driver Lyft selects isn’t coming within minutes. Just let us cancel  without a charge if the driver isn’t coming in the timeframe you tell us. That’s it. Lyfts great otherwise but this issue is just boiling over from how many times I deal with it. Please please please find a fix to this Lyft!!!"
37,A.k.9,"January 30, 2020",4,"Obnoxious drivers I’ve been using this app for a while and have had issues a handful of the time. The first time I experienced an issue was when I requested a Lyft and the driver didn’t bother to come to my location. He kept driving passed where I was and cancelled my trip afterwards. My ride was then picked up by two different drivers and the same thing happened. I’m guessing that was a glitch in the software that day. Today I ordered a Lyft shared saver. Context: I’m at the hospital and needed to get picked up. I walked all the way to the pickup location only to see the driver went to a location of his choosing and didn’t notify me. When I called him, he gave me attitude and told me to come to where he was. Mind you, that location was at the other corner of the hospital property. As I was 10ft from him, he cancelled my ride and drove off. I made sure to take a screenshot of where he was vs where the app told me to stand and his info. It’s too bad that we cannot rate drivers unless the ride is complete. I’d give this ride driver a 1 star if I could. "
38,Ridiculous App Nickname,"February 29, 2020",4,"Lyft Satisfaction Survey When in need of a ride, Lyft is normally very reliable and I have gotten wonderful drivers most of the time. However, when leaving home from Decatur, GA., I experienced a driver (Juan) who accepted my ride request and had me waiting approximately 15-20 minutes and then he wound up dropping my request. My request was to the airport, so I cannot express strongly enough how every minute counted. After his terribly inconsiderate cancellation, I was initially assigned to another driver who was 13 minutes away. I cannot tell you how very frustrated I was with Lyft at that moment. Fortunately, Lyft then found me a closer driver (Lashon) who was only 4 minutes away. Lashon was GREAT and got me to the airport in plenty of time to catch my flight but I still can’t get over Juan accepting my ride request only to have me waiting in vein for 20 minutes wasting my time AND jeopardizing me catching my flight. I would certainly like to see him reprimanded and definitely want him BLOCKED from ever picking up another ride request from me in the future! And this guy supposedly have a 5 star rating? I don’t think so. Very disappointed with that terrible experience 👎🏽"
39,Kyleigh a Math Tutor For Hire,"February 25, 2020",5,"Best Tampa transport in FL Especially Ybor I have quite literally taken hundreds of Lyfts from Old Temple Terrace to Ybor and never once have I had a driver that hasn't been kind and accommodating. We prefer to get out a little before the main walk through of Ybor so our driver doesn't have to navigate the causeway of drunken idiots rambling along 7th as that is largely a pedestrian walkway. On our way home, our drivers are just basically kind to us even if we aren't 100% sober which we greatly appreciate. We have never felt taken advantage of or used by our drivers with this app and I think it has to do with the company ethics over Uber, which pay their drivers the minimum but can't live without tips, vs. the no pressure extra tipping system of Lyft. However, please tip your drivers if they provide the basic services you require as we all live in the  hellscape of late stage capitalism and must rely on each other to take care of those in the service industry. Thanks for reading if you got past ""late stage capitalism"" and stayed with me. And thank you for tolerating my run-in sentences!"
40,Kiggers,"December 5, 2017",5,"Lyft is on its way to creating a professional driving culture Overall I’ve been satisfied with the quality and professionalism of drivers.  Clearly Lyft is working with their team on ensuring drivers are prepared to act as a representative of Lyft rather than someone who simply has some time to pass and takes said person from point A to point B. The added accommodations of bottled water, mints and reading materials all make a difference - I wish all drivers were required to provide this.  Still - some drivers are clearly more interested in providing stellar service and treating this as a job than others.  That being said, I wish there was a way for Lyft to allow for a user to request a particular driver for a month since many users have made a connection with a ptocular driver here and there. If even be willing to pay $1000 a month or more to secure a particular driver that I have made a connection with since I use Lyft 14 plus times a week. It would be a great convenience for those who don’t want to have a car but have the comfort of a set driver."

The changes to the interface has affected the overall accessibility for the visually impaired. This application was not the most accessible prior to the update, but it was usable. Now, the application has become more stressful to use because certain things are more difficult to bring up such as the option to split a fair and other things. The previous version was at least consistent and I knew where to find things. This update rearranged certain functions of the overall experience has made using this application quite difficult to say the least.

They continue to tell me a charge to my MasterCard was not authorized when the bank for my MasterCard told me the day of the incident that the charge WAS authorized. All I would really like is an apology and for someone to look into what must be a system problem. - I added the Lyft app and attempted to use Lyft as it came highly recommended. I requested my first Lyft at LAX after collecting my bags and was told by the app that Lyft was having trouble with my payment method. It said “try another card,” so I had to enter  another card at the airport, and got the same message. I thought if had to do with being 3000 miles from home and maybe they blocked the cards. Called both banks and was told everything was fine with them. One of the bank reps specifically said that the charge came through and the bank AUTHORIZED the charge, and I got the message from Lyft that the card was a problem. My brother got me a car, and the driver was great, but I spent an extra hour at LAX for no good reason because of Lyft. I’ve read online that people have been experiencing this since at least 2013.

We had a professional yet friendly conversation that entertains a quick ride to where I needed to go. He drove safe and I feel comfortable riding in the vehicle. Also, I made reservations for a ride but it was unsuccessful, I was not worried because of the fact that Lyft communicates through text message. So, I was informed throughout the whole process.

It is only to get the app developer’s attention so that some serious changes could be made in be app meant for passengers. Being a Lyft Driver, I had the inconvenience of an irate customer who did not think twice to check for the license plate of the ride he had requested from the app and somehow had three ride requests cancelled before he got into my vehicle out of his own frustration. The passenger, being a 63 old, huge & hefty man, who had a hard time walking five steps towards his Lyft ride was completely unwilling to get out of my car even after realizing he GOT THE WRONG RIDE the fourth time around. I do realize and am guilty of the fact that I had to drop him home which was only 8 minutes away by being offline and missing the rides which could have paid me a lot more than the wrong one. This is a humble request to the developer to PLEASE add a feature for the passengers which will force them to verify the license plate and the driver in the vehicle before the journey begins as this could end up being a lawsuit by keeping this loophole exposed for passengers. Sooner or later, the passengers will find out about this and someone out there will find a way to use this for their advantage."
45,summersyntax,"September 5, 2018",2,"App needs work, Ride/drivers great Dear Lyft - I hope this helps to improve your app!  I tried to edit my ride, then cancel. The app had automatically imputed my home (understandably!) instead of my intended pick up point at the car repair spot; when I realized this, I tapped ‘edit’ which only shows a map instead of my pre- designated destinations - the addresses which I don’t know - hence pre- designated.  Why doesn’t the app list them with an option of a map? Or easily allow one to choose that list? Could not quickly find this option - not user friendly.  When I tried to cancel, it showed ‘fee waived’ but without saying I had only 2 minutes to cancel - this should be clearly stated with a warning in RED.  Thinking the fee would be waived, and I had time, I tried calling the driver; he was no help since he only goes by the inputed map and didn’t know the street where i wanted to meet for the pick up.  So I canceled - but then the app showed he was coming anyway, which was confusing since later on I discovered I was charged the cancel fee - plus, it asked to rate the ride - the driver was faultless here and got 5 Stars.

I’ve been using Lyft for awhile now with out any problem until recently. When the Lyft had arrived as soon as I opened the door the driver asked me for my age. I was thrown off by that question because I’ve never been asked that before. I asked why and he said because I looked underage and he wanted to see my ID. I told him that I wasn’t giving him my ID because I don’t have to. He cancelled the ride and ended up calling someone from Lyft to tell them what had. He told the person on the phone that I was underage which is not true. I then asked the person that was on the phone are you required to show ID to the driver. The person on the phone told me no that it wasn’t required. Even though the driver asked for my ID multiple times. After that had happened I tried to get in contact with Lyft which was very had. Their customer service is absolutely horrible. The next day I received an email from Lyft saying that they had deactivated my account because of feedback say that I might not be of age. And in ordered to reactive my account I would need to send them a photo ID. Which I did. I wouldn’t ride with Lyft anymore and would never tell anyone else to use the app. Use Uber instead.

I liked being able to check a location to see if there were cars there just by moving the pin on the map. Now you’ve updated the app and made it just like Uber and can only see the cars closest to where you currently are. Very often we are bouncing from place to place to place on extremely busy days and like to see en route if there are going to be cars close enough for us to accomplish what’s necessary in the time frames needed. I can’t do that anymore because you think you need to be like them.

After 5 min i got a notification that the lyft was cancelled and I’d be charged $5.  I immediately called the driver who pretended he could not hear me and hung up.  I called a 2nd lyft  and the same thing happened except the guard spoke to the gentleman and told him he was parked in wrong location(limousine parking) and instructed him on where he should go but the driver never came and was charged $5 again because 5 min had passed. A 3rd lyft was requested and after a few min the driver cancelled!  After the 4th attempt, the guard called the driver and spoke to him.  The driver said he was at terminal A.  For whatever reason the lyft app was directing the drivers to terminal A instead of B and I have incurred $10 in charges that I feel I should not have been charge.

We realized it just as soon as we walked into St. Patricks Cathedral and ran out to see if we could catch the driver but had no luck. We then contacted Lyft to see if they were able to call the driver and ask if he would be able to turn around. Apparently, Lyft has a policy in which they are not able to contact drivers while they are “in drive mode“. So, we began with the lost and found process and figured that the phone would be returned to us within 24 hours, which is what we were told. Long story short that 24 hours turned into Lyft never being able to get ahold of our driver and the phone not being returned. A $20 Lyft ride turned into a $500 Lyft ride. This incident happened about a month ago and we still have not received a phone call from Lyft. I will never use this company ever again for their lack of customer service. Be careful with any belongings you have, there is a huge chance Lyft will not help getting them back to you if you mistakenly leave it in a vehicle!!!"
55,hahshhjskshshajaj,"December 30, 2018",5,"Doesn’t work I tried to schedule a ride for 20 minutes in the future. Every time I tried to set the dial to the time I wanted, the dial scrolled back to the current time. Apparently 10 minutes in the future was acceptable to the dial, however. After waiting more than ten minutes, I checked to see whether my ride was on its way. It wasn’t. My ride was scheduled for tomorrow (the app gave no indication of this when I was scheduling). At this time, I scheduled a ride immediately. Before it could arrive, I changed locations and tried to update this in the app. The app has a feature for updating pickup location, but this doesn’t work either. Every time I scrolled to my new location on the map, the app scrolled right back to the old location, and also wouldn’t let me just type in the new address. I tried contacting the driver via text and call, but she never responded and never showed up."

After pressing the button to confirm the pickup spot, I cancelled it immediately because I realized that I could just get one later due to how early it was. I was told that there would be a one time no cancellation fee as I cancelled it immediately. I contacted Lyft in the app to get my money back as the transaction was never cancelled and was told that the money would be accredited towards my next ride. I was charged for the next ride that I took a few minutes later despite being told that I wouldn’t be. I contacted Lyft 2 weeks later to make sure I’d get my money as I wanted to see if the transaction would go through. After a few emails of them telling I wasn’t charged, they then said that it was the right charge and I wouldn’t be getting my money back. They erased the ride from my history since it wasn’t a completed ride and then tell me that I should send them information about the driver from the history that they knew wouldn’t exist anymore. When I mentioned that I would contact my bank, they stopped responding to my emails and never replied after that. It’s been 2 days and I still haven’t been contacted again. Is this even legal?"
57,Ehhh it's ok I guess :/,"March 6, 2020",5,"Worst service I’ve ever had Lyft doesn’t check drivers vehicles or the drivers themselves, I’ve had multiple drivers arrive in cars that are safety hazards; no seat belts, doors not being able to close completely, and they harass me to give them 5 stars and a tip. Not to mention the service is terrible, I’ve been late to work on several occasions because Lyft fails to give the correct pick up and drop off times, often picking me up so late I’ve had to call into work. It’s ridiculous the amount of money I’ve spent canceling rides because of the fees they make you pay when in reality it doesn’t cost them anything to cancel. Drivers often finish other rides first and take an additional 20 minutes to arrive for pick up. You’d be better off using Discount Cabs. Uber gets a bad rap but honestly Lyft is just as terrible. Overpriced, inexperienced drivers, and overall just not a good way to spend your money. Will definitely not be using this app any longer, it’s went completely downhill over the last couple years."
58,Tierraaaaaaaaaaaaa,"September 19, 2019",1,"Passenger Timing Lyft is not mindful about getting their customers to their destination on time. It’s like y’all can seriously care less and it’s just too obvious that y’all so focused on being money hungry that you will literally make a driver back track for someone that’s 8 minutes away. There are times I was picked up between 7-7:10 am & ended up missing 2 trains because I arrived at 7:55 am for a destination that doesn’t even take more than 6 minutes to get to. All because y’all rather get money from Joe, Shmo, & Toe so you guys will pack a car up tight AND make the driver back track. One time I even had a driver pick me up and drive 2 miles away from my house and LYFT made him turn around to go more than halfway back to pick somebody up. It’s really sad because this is something your drivers and passengers complain about quite frequently. I am completely DONE with using LYFT in the morning for work because messing around with y’all, I’ll be late picking up and dropping off people all across town. UBER pool adds passengers that’s already in the direction we’re going, y’all completely snatch up people that’s not even close to the original route for the passengers already in the car.

59,Frustrated Blind Rider,"July 2, 2019",3,"Frustrated Blind Rider I use Lyft every day. As someone who is legally blind and cannot drive, I rely on Lyft and Uber a lot. I also use a guide dog. Multiple times, I have run into problems with drivers cancelling for no reason after they see me walking with my dog. They have been trained to know that they have to accept riders with guide dogs, so drivers have learned to not say anything and give no reason at all so they can continue to deny service with impunity. And they do get impunity. As someone who has often followed up on Lyft’s investigations, I know the driver faces little to no repercussions for their actions. I’ve also noticed that blind friends who cannot visually spot cars often have drivers turn impatient on them and cancel the ride after they call and explain they need verbal directions to the location of the car. This is especially frustrating when the driver has parked far away from the actual destination. This is unacceptable. Lyft doesn’t allow you to rate drivers who cancel on you, so there is no recourse for the abandoned rider."
60,Gan596,"February 17, 2018",1,"Find Something Else Easily the worst rideshare service I’ve used. Rides are regularly cancelled and the customer is charged a fee, despite it being the drivers who cancel, riders will regularly be booted from scheduled rides without notice requiring them to request another, and on this service I have experienced drivers making disgusting comments about women, race, and gender. And I’m not talking some mild nonsense, but vulgar language so bad that I felt like I needed to shower after the ride. Repeated complaints  about this to Lyft do nothing. Further, the drivers themselves are unsafe, rude, and generally have so much difficulty with English that communicating is near impossible. As someone who fully understands the difficulties of learning a second language, I feel for them. But at the same time, if you are not even conversant enough in the local language to be able to answer a simple phone call to find out where the ride is located, there’s an issue. Particularly when that leads to the rider missing the ride and being charged a fee. "

Lyft took away the option for the customer to deactivate their own account through the app or online. This is convenient for them as it make it difficult for people to cancel their account. I have been on hold twice on the phone to find all of this this out, and the phone rep was rude to me (telling me it was my fault someone stole my card?!?!). Previously, I have urged people to use Lyft, despite them being more expensive than Uber, but I will never again use Lyft until their policies are changed. They have made this situation much more difficult than it needed to be.

62,carolina1601,"June 1, 2018",1,Fraud Ride!! I ordered a Lyft ride this afternoon and the driver was super friendly and nice. I was running late and not really paying attention but he engaged me in conversation to the point that i started talking to him. I just Mentioned being in a rush because i was running late. Well i go into work and 2 hours later i get a notification saying my ride has ended. I’m like oh yeah let me go rate him and as i go in to rate him i see a charge for 102 dollars. He never ended the ride and drove 90 miles away for 2 hours. Lyft refunded my money but still charged me fir the original ride and a 10 dollar credit but that’s not going to give me peace of mind to use it again. I would have not even checked if i hadn’t gotten the notification and wanted to give him a good review. After that happened it didn’t give me the option to rate him so he can do it again to someone else. A 5 dollar ride turned into a 102 dollar ride. More then likely that will be my last Lyft ride. Oh and they said he forgot to turn it off. I called my friend who says it’s impossible because it keeps running while you are connected and if he was still doing the job he would have noticed not getting request in 85 miles. If not he would of disconnected from Lyft.
63,oh well cc,"August 6, 2018",4,4:30 PM I sent a customer review about the app because it was not performing as it should I pre-arrangedOn the app the night before a pick up for today’s schedule pick up I will go to confirm and make sure that everything is going according to my schedule and the request is gone no text from your company stating that I was was too early to book a Lyft within 24 hours? So I decided to try again and book my pick up then the app begin preform oddly it booked my pick up and my destination on the same address and then it told me that he couldn’t do that it did that several times and finally begin to work right but that was way frustrated because it was at the end of my workday and I had things to do I sent you all an email and have not heard from you and this is my second complaint about the app today although my driver was great and be new tire city he did a great job to command our traffic and made and got me home safely and that’s the upside the app is the downside hope to hear from you you can see
64,Copybuffer,"October 15, 2018",1,"OK...I’m done with this app and LYFT.  I tried to like you, I really did. My attempts to use Lyft are always to and from airports in different cities. And most times I’m on this app and their major competitor’s app comparing price quotes and driver availability. Then I want to schedule a ride for a pickup time. Have had drivers who ignore schedule time and accept the request right away and show up an hour early.  If I choose to take the “line jumpers” ride to avoid a cancellation fee I’ll invariably get a notice that another driver has accepted the original pickup time is showing up in a few minutes. By that time I’m at my destination. The app apparently isn’t smart enough to ascertain the requested route has been fulfilled. And not a very intuitive way to cancel the redundant ride to add insult to injury. Or drivers will accept a scheduled ride way in advance then when I am notified they’re 5 min away and text them to reinforce the scheduled pickup time they’ll try to get ME to cancel and collect a fee. So driver training appears to be an issue or perhaps the drivers have figured out there is reward or no consequences for “claim jumping” scheduled rides. I’m done...even the automated “here’s a credit” for the mixup ends up being a lure for the next frustrating experience."

He came around a corner and there was a man standing up on the shoulder with a large object  in his hands. He threw it and it hit my friends windshield dead center, shattering the entire windshield. Keep in mind that he had a Lyft passenger in the vehicle at the time of this happening.  Luckily it did not come through the windshield but regardless of that it caused a serious safety threat.  My friend is a good driver so he did not lose control of the vehicle or anything but he was unable to complete his drives due to having a shattered windshield.  This is where it gets disgusting.  He took the vehicle into the Lyft hub on Monday only to learn that not only did he have to pay an additional $70 for his rental fee due to noy getting all the required drives but. THEY ARE MAKING HIM PAY $150 TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD. He feels defeated by this company and it is appalling to me because they should feel grateful that nobody was seriously injured or worse and they want to screw him completely over.

You see cars on the map that was like they’re available it says three minutes and then when you hit the button you get a nine minute car time. I have tons of screen shots to prove it. What is that about?! Stuff like that happens all the time!! I think Lyft puts fake cars on the map to look it like it’s more populated than it is. Or, cars that have already been picked up are still left on the map to make it appear tot he rider there are more drivers out on the road. They have to be falsifying the supply. "
68,Tiffanywiffiny,"June 22, 2019",5,"Racist Drivers - No support from Lyft I just had a driver come to my apartment building. Stop. Look at me. Then when I walk towards his car, speed off and cancel the ride. Lyft has offered no support on the issue. I also doubt that I’m the first black person that this piece of trash, Rachid has done this to. Makes matters worse, I needed to pick up my car from the mechanic with a half hour. I was standing outside of my apartment in angst hoping the next Lyft driver wouldn’t be a racist piece of garbage. I am deleting the app and going back to Uber. One of the reasons why apps like these have done so well is because they’ve supposedly operated under anti-discriminate practices unlike cab companies which have often refused rides to black people. Guess this is the same principle...and not that it should matter but I live in a very nice area and the location that I was being dropped off to is also a nice location. Pathetic racist trash should not be employed in positions that require them to interact with the general public."
69,Prafulla.,"September 25, 2019",5,"Lyft is amazing. I am legally blind with a very limited vision. As a result, I can not drive. So, I frequently use services of Lyft. Since Lyft is accurate with it’s GPS and prompt, I love Lyft though they don’t give me any offers. I just have one suggestion that Lyft developers should add in app communication with the driver which will be even easier for people like me having vision issues and who use ipad (for reading convenience due to its bigger view and font size compare to any phone) for Lyft app and Separate phone. Also, Lyft should also start accepting travellers having Voip numbers such as “Magicjack” numbers which is very convenient. If Lyft starts accepting “Magicjack” numbers, then I don’t need to have a separate phone and can therefore get rid of my phone which I use mainly for lyft communications. I am not comparing but Uber accepts traveller having Magicjack numbers which is why I find it more convenient and use it more frequently these days. I hope Lyft management will consider these 2 things. Thank you."
70,short she wolf,"August 1, 2018",5,"Problems using the application The current version of the application is nearly impossible to navigate if you are a visually impaired Customer. Are use a mixture of vision and a feature on the iPhone called voice over (synthesized speech). This enables me to figure out where I am on the screen. Unfortunately, because of the current version of the application, voiceover sometimes cannot locate what the blind or visually impaired Customer needs to find. For instance, I have a great deal of difficulty just trying to figure out how to rate the driver‘s performance. There used to be a map that would show the drivers progress when in route to the pick up location, however, that map is no longer available. Even though I am visually impaired, I can see the map to some extent. Additionally, that same type of map would be visible on the screen when in route to the intended destination. That is no longer there either. Some version of the former interface needs to be restored."

73,Sdr1624,"November 17, 2018",2,"Glitches Most of the time the app works well. I just got back from traveling, and used it a lot while away. One time, though, I got charged a cancellation fee when I watched the driver go right past me and the app clearly showed him blocks away while the 5 minutes counted down. Tonight I was waiting at the airport for my ride home, and after waiting 8 minutes was notified the driver was here while the map showed him driving in circles at a different terminal. This time I took screenshots, in case I got charged again. I was then matched with another driver, 11 minutes away, but a few minutes later that dropped and I was matched again with a third driver 10 minutes away who finally showed up. Waited 25 minutes total at the curb just to get a ride while everyone around me was getting picked up in a few minutes. The app help center doesn’t let you complain or ask questions except in a limited set of circumstances, hence this review. When the app works, it’s great, but when it doesn’t, there’s no customer service and no way to contact them. Incredibly frustrating when it’s late at night and you just want to get home."
74,asdfg67890,"April 4, 2019",5,"I always feel safe with Lyft As a woman especially, safety is the most important factor to me whenever I utilize a ride sharing service. With Lyft, unlike Uber, I have always had a positive experience with drivers. I have never once felt unsafe on a trip with Lyft, which is different than my numerous Uber experiences. Perhaps this consistently positive experience is due to the background check that Lyft makes its drivers pass or the way they train their drivers? I’m unsure of the reason behind this discrepancy, but I do know that I’ve never had a bad Lyft experience. This element of consistent safety and professionalism is the reason why I use Lyft above all other ridesharing apps. The only downside is that compared with Uber, in some cities, there are fewer Lyft drivers which translates into longer initial wait times for drivers.

He literally didn’t move within those 5 minutes why should I be charged for something the driver is doing? There should be a system where if the driver doesn’t move at all for a certain time they should be charged or at least if I’m going to cancel I shouldn’t be charged a fee. That way I’m not there in the same spot waiting for someone who isn’t even moving. I didn’t go searching for the driver in that parking lot because I do not move from my spot when I order a lyft so that then I’m not told that I wasn’t even at the destination.

They claim that because the driver brought my “lost” groceries back, they charged me but my groceries were never “lost”, they were stolen. Lyft locked out the “contact driver” tab after the first attempt of use and seems to have a long and tedious email process for all other forms of support for riders (customers). I am highly upset, and despite talking to Lyft constantly about this issue, they stand by their flawed reasoning. Lyft has failed to implement a fair and just policy for stolen items and don’t even have an investigational protocol. At this rate, drivers can always drive away with your items as you are unloading and claim that the you “left” them, in an effort to gain some sort of bonus.

Many times they have past the spot I was in and I cannot contact them and tell where to go even though it’s on the map. Some drivers are clueless but more so on the Uber app. They also should let you see the ratings on the drivers and us and let us decide if we want that driver or not so we can pick another one. Some drivers are not good and I’ve had some horrible chats with some that don’t even talk and are rude. Also if you want to block drivers that you had horrible experiences with we should do be allowed to do so. I also think they should offer more rewards programs.

It’s not my responsibility to police Lyft’s employees and it just feels petty and dishonest (nobody likes a tattletale) to me. I choose instead to not rate them and give them less of a tip that I typically do, which always is $10 cash on a $27 ride. I appreciate your service and really respect my drivers.

We spoke over the phone I explained in great detail where he needed to go inside the garage at lot C. He insisted he was in line at Lot C, however he was not inside the garage he was in the general pick up area, not in the designated lyft-Uber area. I watched on the map simulation as he circled the airport four times missing the entrance four times or more. I received the threat from Lyft that I would be charged for missing a pick up, apparently he pushed the button that he had pick me up. This was a lie, I called a second Lyft, once I figured out that I had been abandoned by the first driver.   As a second driver arrived, the first driver also arrived just ahead of him. He picked up two other individuals that called Lyft.  No apologies at all from the driver who abandoned me. I jokingly warned the passengers they might be in for an adventure. When the second Lyft driver and I were exiting, I witnessed the first driver apparently lost circling the garage looking for the exit.  I was charged a five dollar penalty, and will apparently be downgraded for my five star status. I consider this to be both theft and defamation of character."

Except for the occasional rude driver. The one thing I will say about Lyft is that it is definitely a step up from checker the service is far quicker than checker and far more professional. 
90,WilliamChuck,"July 7, 2018",5,"I was harassed by another Lyft driver When I came out of door 20 on level two of MCO airport in Orlando, there was a car with a lift and Uber trade dress. He asked me if he could help me by offering me a ride. I shoot him I already had a Lyft driver coming. He insisted that lots of bad things happened at the airport and he would gladly take me if I would cancel the first left. He then began to show how the other driver was driving in circles to drive up the price. He strongly suggested that I cancel and promised that he would be able to get the cancellation fee back for me. I never saw this guy near his phone his car was parked and he continuously ran around in circles addressing people directly. I know that this is not the way that lift or Uber does business. When Andy finally did arrive after circling the airport three times according to the app, he was very nice and only took two wrong turns to get us to the hotel. He was nice enough to allow me to charge my phone in his car."
91,hdhfyjctgshjfu,"July 20, 2018",4,"Disappointing experiences lately I used to love Lyft but I’ve been having some disappointing experiences lately with the drivers. Today I waited for over 20 mins at La Guardia because the driver accepted the job, drove past the pick up point, never answered my calls or texts and never came back. I didn’t know what to do and was so tired from traveling so after several attempts I canceled the ride and requested a new driver. I was charged a $10 cancellation fee for something I had no control over. I sent in a complaint and am waiting to see how it’s resolved. Last week I also requested a car and the driver called to ask where I was going. After I said Queens, he said his tire was punctured and I should cancel the request. Seriously???? I understand that drivers are now doing these kinds of things because they don’t want ‘short drops’ because they don’t make as much money. This is very disappointing and frustrating especially after having traveled all day and just wanting to go home and rest!"
92,cantenter a nn,"August 5, 2018",5,Lyft My first driver -Claudio -couldn’t find my house (which is on a private way and does not show exactly where the house is on GPS) but I was trying to explain how to get here and because he did not have a clear understanding of the English language he was having a lot of difficulty. Finally he just hung up on me. I see another driver has taken over for him. This time I walk down to the Main Street so the driver could see me. Of course he immediately put in my destinations address into his GPS. I say no no no no just go down Route nine till you hit Stuart Street. Why would you go any other way? He followed my instructions and I was only six minutes late getting to my destination after the first guy couldn’t even find me for the first 15 minutes. So needless to say I was disappointed with Lyft service for my ride. But in defense of Lyft my ride home was way faster and the driver followed my instructions to get to my house (way faster than GPS).
93,ploi4862,"October 24, 2018",1,"Terrible customer service and values I was falsely accused of throwing up and damaging a car and was automatically charged by Lyft without consulting me first or even receiving a statement from me. The request that the driver sent said she specifically identified me for the incident and Lyft just took her word for it and charged me. AFTER I told Lyft that I live on a college campus and would be glad to hand them security surveillance footage of my dropout did they agree to refund me my money and say they're still ""investigating."" If I did not have that evidence, I would have just have $150 stolen from my bank account like that. What's stopping other drivers just randomly charging me or other people for damage and just having Lyft take money straight from your bank account and THEN investigating??? Also when asking how I could be properly compensated and the driver receive repercussions for falsifying a claim, they just gave me a shrug response and basically told me that they just took her word for it and found me guilty  and didn't even apologize. No compensation and no consequences for drivers who do this.... What happens next time if someone doesn't have security cameras on them all the time?"
94,alternativemusic,"October 28, 2018",1,"Was robbed. No refund. Worst customer service I got robbed and people used my Lyft. I contacted lyft and told them only to call me.

The people who robbed me were black and I am white, I know I get Ubers and lyfts for other people occasionally but I always contact the driver to let them know it won’t be me so how were they even able to pull it off? I also wanted to get drop off information from that ride so I could give it to police. That was denied. And how could they deny that when it’s my account? They then said I had no account with my email so i couldn’t even log in after my phone had been stolen even though I sent them screenshots of lyft receipts sent to my email. After being ignored for a phone call, having it dragged out for a week, denied information about rides on MY ACCOUNT, having them tell me my account doesn’t exist, and not giving me a refund on a ride stolen from my account and letting them know I would be sending my customer service nightmare story to somebody with a travel blog I can officially say F—- Lyft. Your customer service is the most garbage I’ve ever seen from any company."
95,Fìgarõ,"February 8, 2019",3,"It’s okay Well, I’ve been using both Lyft and Uber for a while, I’ve switched to Lyft because it honestly seems like I get more drivers and I’ve noticed Lyft often has it a dollar or so cheaper often times, so that’s nice. But, the map is my issue, a lot of drivers seem to get turned around because they follow the map. Also, the time predictions aren’t very good at all. In times of no traffic, it can estimate drivers coming within 5 minutes, but often it takes 10, that being said the time predicting my arrival tends to be off as well. I’d say 60% of the time I find myself at least 10 minutes late if not later. The drivers clearly follow the speed limits well, this is not their issue. Idk where the map comes from, but I personally use google maps on my phone, and sometimes during a ride I’ll check maps to see what the real time is, and it’s always very accurate. Within 2 minutes at most. And google predicts the traffic and everything too, I’ve never see Lyft accurately predict the the time based off the conditions of driving."
96,virlie,"June 7, 2019",3,"It’s okay, but the app itself needs work. The service is great, but there have been countless times that the app will say driver is 5 mins away, for as long as 15 minutes, or two minutes away and two minutes have come and gone, your pick-up still isn’t there. "
97,Dkn3,"November 14, 2019",3,"Changes to drop off time Recently I’ve started having a big problem with lyft. It isn’t usually the driver’s fault, so I still give good reviews and tip which may minimize the extent of the problem from the company’s perspective. But when booking a ride it shows the price, estimated pick up time and estimated drop off. Immediately after I order, the pick up and drop off times increase and I if I try to cancel I’m threatened with a cancellation fee. In one example this week, my drop off ended up being twenty minutes later than the estimated time when I booked the ride, and it wasn’t a shared lyft. I could have just taken public transportation and saved money instead of paying for lyft based on the expectation of a faster trip. The app should do a better job of estimating pick up and drop off times so riders can make an informed decision before paying. It knows where it’s drivers are and traffic patterns so barring an accident happening while en route, 20 minutes shouldn’t be added to the drop off time for what should have been a 35 minute ride."
98,VickyGonzalez7,"December 30, 2019",1,"Dangerous I get theyre trying to help with saving money but its pretty dangerous to have the person “waiting” for their ride to walk to a pin point the driver thinks theyre picking up the person which frustrates both people. Its also dangerous for a women (like myself) to walk a block from where i originally was waiting and dropped off far from where i pinned to be dropped off. An example to give, was that i pinned my pickup at the uber spot at the grove and it made me walk a block away to the driver and the driver was upset thinking i was taking my sweet time to get to them when really i was walking towards them when they could have just picked me up where i was and going home i noticed it wanted to drop me off a street away which i live in a dangerous area and its not safe to walk anywhere so i explained to the driver whats going on and they were nice and understanding to drop me off to the real spot and thought it was also dangerous for me to walk to my house. Something has to be changed to make it safer for others, i felt that it was fine as it was before a simple picking up the person from their waiting spot till they get dropped off where the person wants"

I asked the driver how to input the last stop and he said I didn’t need to, that I’m he would just wait and take me around the corner.

I’ve been using its services very often now for like 2 months, and everything is good, but a good amount of my drivers have arrived extremely early. I don’t mind, but it kind of makes me feel bad having them waiting although they chose to come like 10 minutes before the pickup time, and I’ve even had some call me to see if I was coming out when it wasn’t even near the pickup time frame. Besides that, the main reason I’m giving 3 stars is because the recent update doesn’t have the schedule a future ride feature anymore. I searched and searched and couldn’t find it. I like to schedule my rides the night before so it can be taken care of before 7 am comes, or some hours before 11 pm just in case. Though, now I have to risk not being able to get a ride or not being able to get one at the right time because I can’t schedule ahead of time. This has caused me to now ride with Uber. If the feature is brought back, I’ll start riding with Lyft again."

Once the driver arrived she didn’t even answer me when I asked why it took so long. When I requested her that I am running late and have a flight to make she just said ok. On top of that she decided to take her own route to minimize the distance to travel where as the app was telling to take a longer route and could have been more time effective. When I asked her than got a cold shoulder and she continued on her drive. I was delayed by more than 25 minutes because of this and missed my flight. When I contacted the customer service I was told that the fare was calculated correctly which may be true but the delayed costed me missing my flight. Customer service didn’t even say anything about other issues which I sent in my feedback. The car was dirty like hell. Have pictures to show the same. Lyft just doesn’t care what customers think as long as they are cheaper possibly.

Got his information then he dropped me.  The third driver he was five minutes away when he dropped me.  The next person was twenty minutes away.  Now it would be a half hour after the scheduled time.  She assured me she would not drop me.  Tawana was great. I missed muy metro by seconds but another one we just ten minutes away.  So there was no problem because I know to put in flex time and add thirty minutes for Lyft to show up.

However, it has been my experience that driver’s pick up others and make stops along the way to pick you up, after already accepting your ride request. This is very annoying and infuriating at times, once a driver agrees to pick you up for a specific time, they should not make any other stops. Not only is this unprofessional, but it has made me late to work on multiple occasions. I tried requesting a ride as far back as 30 mins or even an hour in advance, but drivers still failed to get me to work on time. Also, sometimes it can take up to 20 mins just for a driver to say that they’ve accepted your ride request, which is fairly inconvenient for people needing to be somewhere at a specific time. Please do something about this, when you order a ride to come pick you up at 4:30 and the driver confirms that they will be there at that time, they should not arrive at 5:00 due to stops along the way."

106,jeromeoeoeo,"August 14, 2019",5,"The best ride in town, but room for improvement! I love that I have Lyft as an option!!! The lack of public transportation in Nashville is easily seen. Lyft is a fast and affordable option, especially with the discounts (if they don’t expire before you are able to use them... that should be looked at closer!). I’m even ok with the raise in price according to demand. The shared rides are a great option! They may take a little longer, but you get what you pay for... My biggest concern about Lyft is how quick the driver is able to report you as a no show. There should be a minimum of 3 minutes (5 would be better!) before you get stuck with a $5 late fee & have to wait for another ride. Also the charge you see should be what you pay... there have been times I noticed the price raised up as I was booking my Lyft. I can cover it, but it’s annoying when I see that. "

I have only had a couple bad experiences with drivers, and they always work with me and I always tip them generously. But the fact that the company gives you $1 off rides as a promocode is rediculous. New riders get these $10 off and $5 and 50% off coupons that get them from point A to point B easily, but where is all this work to retain customers that keep buying rides? I’ve spent over $180 in the past few months to get myself out of situations where I dont have a car to get home with, and to be honest I just feel like the company only wants more and more users to spend their money once or twice instead of having customers that spend hundreds on transportation. That being said, I’ll have to give this 4 stars because the people that work for the app are always wonderful and always have great conversations on the way. However, the company needs to work on customer retention."

One driver made me walk six houses down almost to the end of the block and said he was gonna departure if I didn't meet him even thought I paid so it wouldn't be carpool. Then, another driver canceled right before he reached me and I had waited 10 min. But this very last experience was it for me, the driver calls me all ride saying that he had passed me and he would turn around one more time before leaving. First of all, I was the only person standing in front of my building and he had not honked or stopped in front of me. So I told him that I didn't see anyone, he then stopped at the corner of the street and I stood my ground. If we are forced to pay high prices the least these drivers can do is be courteous. Then, once I got in the car he attempted to change his attitude but he was speeding trying to just drop me off. We almost hit two cars and then a police car hit their sirens behind us. Seriously, drivers should be trained before even being allowed to drive for your company."

Walked out and walked down a five acre driveway only to find out the lyft was not here but on the way. Got down to the road and mail box only to find out that the lyft wasn’t coming but another was on the way within nine minutes. Thirty minutes later I had to reorder another lyft due to the second one saying they were there at said location but not being there and I suppose they canceled!! This is ridiculous, I watched on the app both the first and second lyfts heading my way but never showing up and was never informed that the second canceled even though I was waiting at the mailbox ready to go! After ordering the Third lyft I was questioning if that one would show up at all!! Luckily it did and the driver David was exceptional but your apps lack of respect for the the customer and customers time has me questioning if I want to even suggest others using this app. I feel let down and slightly abused by this evenings lyft services besides the fact that David came to our rescue.

Made me guide her the entire way because she didn’t want to take the toll. What if I didn’t know where we were going either? She was driving down the middle of the road almost the entire time. Half way thru our ride she asks my friend and I if we had to go to the bathroom and we said no. She said “I do, so I’m pulling over”. Fine. You gotta go when you gotta go. I get that. But, she made us go into the Chevron with her, then when they’re toilet wasn’t working, she made us walk across the street to jack n the box at 10:30 pm to use their bathroom, but they were closed. So we finally found a grocery store that was open and went there. She left us in the car and took 15 minutes. Overall, she made us almost an hour late. When I had emailed Lyft to see if I could get my money back or a partial refund for the inconvenience they said no everything was calculated properly and my total wouldn’t be adjusted.

I was trying to have him pick up my fiancé at work and he called because he was lost and was unwilling to listen to me give him accurate directions. He hung up on me and I am requesting the $5 that I was charged be returned. When he stated he arrived, the map showed he was not near the pick up area (about 3 blocks away). He stated he was not familiar with the area and was impatient then hung up. His number was a Pennsylvania number. Especially if you are hiring drivers who are from out of state, ensure that they can follow directions. I had to get another driver after and the whole situation stressed me out completely. This is the worst week, my grandma just passed away, my car situation fell through, and your choice in hiring this Lyft driver/not taking time to train him caused me stress and money that I need. This is not what I have ever experienced with your company. Please return the $5 or help me cover part of the costs of the Lyft I need for tomorrow. That’s all I’m asking. It was unfairly charged."
112,Riding in Houston,"October 16, 2018",3,"Good and bad experience Chose Lift over Uber initially, based on a big TV review done here in Houston. Used Lift for a year and was generally happy with it until recently, when two bad experiences in a row happened within a two-week period. In one, I almost missed my flight, in another, waited for a ride at the airport for almost 30 minutes while my driver was stuck somewhere out of contact and I did not have my reading glasses handy to figure out how to ask for help using the Lift app and fearing that my phone battery would be dead soon and I would not be able to request another lift. On the good side, Lift’s customer service has been good after the fact: in one case, they reviewed my complaint within one day and made a fair corrective action; in the last case with driver not showing up, the system recognized the immobility problem and allowed me to cancel the standing request without a penalty and order another ride. So, my overall feeling is that Lift as a system is not bad, but their driver selection could be better."

For example, this morning it showed me arriving at my destination at 10:00 am, which is when I needed to be there, but once I called the Lyft it THEN added in the time for the driver to get to me, pushing my arrival time back by that amount and making me late. I could have gone to the train and arrived at the same time if I had seen that in time to leave for the train, but it’s often down to the wire and by the time I see the updated arrival time it’s too late to cancel the ride and take the train.

The first one: the driver was tailgating during the entire ride. My two friends and I were not pleased so I rated him at the end and left a comment about the unsafe driving. Later that night, I took a ride alone . The driver was nice at first and as the ride went on, he asked me and then insisted to “hang out” before dropping me off multiple times. I got scared when he took a longer and less direct route to my destination. I felt uncomfortable and did not rate him after the ride ended, instead, I sent Lyft customer service a message through the app, which took at least 2 days to get a reply.

The app is not operating real time about availability and time. It also now takes them around 10 minutes to even arrive. I called a Lyft and it said 11 minutes away. Mind you, I live in the middle of Los Angeles. Literally right outside DTLA. I wait for 11 minutes and then the driver cancels and auto pairs me with someone 6 minutes away. At this point I’m waiting almost 20 minutes for a Lyft to even arrive. The map doesn’t move. The driver isn’t communicating. And when I thought leaving 30 minutes early would get me on time to my meeting, I’m now pushing it. The Lyft never arrived in 6 minutes and since the map wasn’t moving, I called an Uber that got there faster. It was more expensive, but willing to pay more if it means I’ll get to my engagements on time. Next day, I am meeting client. same thing happens. So I guess call your Lyft like 30 minutes before you actually need to leave and hope they don’t arrive sooner. Gone are the days of them being there in 1-5 minutes.  "

For the second time in a month, the first on Uber and tonight with Lyft, he responds to the pick-up and then cancels at the pick-up when he finds out the ride is more than 5 minutes or outside of Breckenridge, CO. He is gaming the system to the detriment of other drivers and the frustration of customers. Because the vast majority are none the wiser, they don’t know to capture his name or have any way of seeing who just canceled their pickup leaving them standing at the curb. Because I had this experience with the same guy within the last month for an identical pick-up, the prior on Uber, I was suspicious when the a grey Caravan popped up this time so I did a screen capture in case it was the same guy. He is gaming both Lyft and Uber in exactly the same way. We’ve heard from other drivers who have heard similar stories of this guy from other customers. I implore you to take action and ban him from your service.

The last person I was tracking drove right by andissed her turn...  That's when I said screw this and screw Lyft. If I'm going to miss my flight because of this....mind you it's not like I last minute scheduled this... I scheduled this two weeks before my flight so.... Can't say they didn't know. Uber showed up within 4 minutes ,and get this... Took us to the airport... For CHEAPER!"

She doesn’t drive, so this is her sole mode of transportation on a daily basis. There have been MULTIPLE times that the driver never showed, didn’t call, didn’t answer our calls, and canceled the transaction. When this occurred, Lyft actually CHARGED US $5 for the cancellation! Can you believe this?!?! We stand around waiting for a ride, the driver doesn’t show, and we get charged? That’s unbelievable. And good luck trying to get any help from Lyft when this happens.

(I like Lyft better than Uber) only once in the last year have I ever had a problem with not getting picked up. I’ve also left 2 cell phones and a cell phone charger in  Lyft cars and your system for notifying the driver of what I left works well. All 3 times I got my item back in a timely manner. Only problem I have with you guys is that you keep switching the way I call for a ride; I’ve always just put in my pick-up location first and then put in my destination. This time you asked where I was going first and when I then put in my pick-up location I couldn’t figure out how to start the trip. Somehow I eventually figured it out. But when you change something, even if you think the new way is “better” remember that some of your clients are older, and don’t take well to changes."

Luckily when I immediately ordered a Lyft car now Everything was absolutely fantastic. This was my first Lyft experience and the first driver was horrific and the second driver was fantastic.

I have heard numerous horror stories from my friends and even worse ones from people on the internet about Lyft drivers who have at best made them feel extremely uncomfortable and at worst RAPED them.

They seem to always choose the “scenic route” and not the fastest/shortest route. Not sure if this happens to everyone -of course it depends on whether the drop off location has multiple routes to select from- which Las Vegas, NV does, but two times today I’ve had to provide the driver with an alternate way because the driver’s Lyft map, the highlighted route, added 2-3x as many miles as the shortest/fastest routes (yes, I did type routes because there were multiple shorter/faster paths to choose from). I just recommend riders pay attention to Lyft’s given route & provide your driver with a faster/shorter way, if available. Might save y’all some time & money. Overall a great option to get from Point A to Point B, a little more $$ than Uber, but less issues than the Uber mobile app, for me anyway. Safe riding y’all!!!!"
128,Naturalist To Be,"September 22, 2019",3,"Changed car and driver three times. I usually have a good experience with Lyft, but today in Orlando not so much.  But maybe Lyft was just trying to sort out my perfect driver.  First the app tells me one driver is on his way. Still on his way. Oh, he’s right there; you have five minutes.  In the crowded area around door 14, is it this white Toyota, no, maybe this one.  Then with still some time before my five minutes is up, the app takes that car description away and gives me another.  Don’t find him, call frantically, don’t leave until I find you.  Then suddenly car number 3 pops up.  That person actually shows up.  And I’m off to my destination with a good driver and good conversation.  All’s well that ends well, but still, Lyft, don’t do that.  An added note.  In Texas with license plates on the front, yes, five minutes.  In states with no plates on the front, either figure out a better way for passengers and drivers to recognize each other or give more time, especially where the curb is crowded."

They claim they “credit” your account, but guess what? Your “credits” expire! The cancellation fees you get credited for Lyft’a poor service, EXPIRES. They also allow drivers to use fake names on their profiles such as X-Funk. I reported this man for having overly tinted windows, hiding his face behind large sunglasses, and demanding I put my laptop backpack in his trunk. No other driver from either Lyft or Uber has ever asked that. When I reported this man to Lyft, I was reached out to through text message to tell me they would “take this as feedback but could not do anything and hoped I would understand their professional decision.” What I WILL be doing is contacting law enforcement to report this to protect young females from using this service. I will also be reporting the theft of my cancellation “credits” that were illegitimately taken. Stick with Uber and save yourself the trouble."

I am still owed $20 from two tolls and that does not include several tolls overtime totaling more than $50 that I could not get reimbursed because I previously needed to wait 2-3 business days for the toll to post on the account. I spend at least $1000 in tolls for ride-sharing per year and I do not see sufficient effort from ride sharing companies to compensate drivers for their specific business expenses. My maintenance is multiple times higher and gas isn’t cheap. Customer service for drivers has taken long to respond. Many things need to improve.

After the ride (I was on my way to work, which requires professional presentation) I immediately reported this to Lyft as a safety concern and never was responded to. Two days later, I get a charge on my card for “damages” with pictures of a strange foreign substance smeared about the back seat. Not only was this not me, but I’d be fired if I showed up to work with strange stuff like that, so there’s no way I could have done that. I tried to file a dispute via email after getting hung up on the phone twice while on “hold” and the “2 hour max” response time took 7 hours where they basically told me not all damages are intentional but they’re still gonna charge me.

At the same time, I also messaged lyft to see if they could help. They were unable to help me but still forced an additional and unexpected “lost and found” charge on me almost an hour after I resolved the incident including a well deserved cash tip for the driver. I contacted lyft’s support and explained the situation; I told them I‘d like to explain the situation in more detail over the phone. They dismissed my written explanation and said that they “are unable to make outbound calls” and that “[they] can do text or email which is the fastest and most efficient way for [them]”, despite the opposite being true.

136,Kidd_412,"May 31, 2019",3,"Okay. It’s good to make some quick cash for little things like groceries or to get your nails done but there are some cons worth mentioning. Lyft does not pay for the driver to pick someone up. For instance, someone may be a 5 minute drive away from you and uber does not pay you for the 5 minutes you have to drive to get someone. Also, you don’t know where you will be going until you pick the person up. They can be going 2 minutes down the street or 25 but you won’t know until you get in the car. Then at the end of the ride you get paid. You can drive someone for 15 minutes and get paid $5-6 not including travel time to get them as I mentioned before. I drove from 8-5 and made $80 in one day which is not really good meaning I got paid roughly $10 an hr. I think Lyft is in favor of the people using the service, they want to make it cheap for people to get around but it’s not really worth the mileage, gas and strangers in your car at least from my experience so far."

I have contacted their customer service 4 times and no response. You can’t call anyone, the only thing you can do when you have a problem is send a message. I want to speak with a real person but it seems like they only care about getting their money and have no interest if the customer is happy or not. I also was upset I ordered a ride the other day and it said 6 minutes but my 2 teenage girls had to wait in the cold for more than a half an hour and nothing was done about that either.

I called Lyft costumer service the next morning and finding there phone number was a chore in itself. I then asked for 50$ ride credit, because regardless of how their drivers act as a company they should make sure to treat their customers well and provide compensation to riders if they charge users $5 if we cancel rides. I was told this was not possible and I asked to talk to a supervisor. The supervisor told me there was nothing she could do as they already refunded the $5 charge they CHARGED ME!  As a publicity traded stock their costumer service should be a high concern! I have used Lyft for 7 years and never contacted costumer service once,  but when you need them they are ABSENT!!!!

Why I was charged the same amount of the ride excluding the tip, the conversation continued with supervisor confirming to me it happens with every ride, as a conclusion if I took a ride which will cost me $40 , a total of $80 dollars will be deducted separately then I will get back the other $40 dollars later!!!, and and insisted it was not a charge, however from my end it is already Deducted and I will loss access to my money until it will be posted back to my account!!, this is bizarre, and frankly not acceptable."

I’m literally waiting on a driver right now who’s finishing a 10 minute ride. I love drivers and they get me to places on time but this definitely needs to be fix.

This has happened multiple times and every time I try and contact a customer service rep about my issue, they are not helpful at all, the person is short and assumes that I do not understand what is happening, rather than excepting that they have made a mistake, they act like it is normal to take out an extra hold on your account, and they do not refund the money until you contact them multiple times about the situation. If it was a normal hold it should happen the same day as the ride and the original charge but instead it happens a day later, or in my recent case, a few days later.

But the last two rides that I have taken, overcharged me for what I was quoted, even more than what the final amount was whenever you go to tip your driver. My first ride was quoted at just over $6 And I tipped my driver, my second ride was quoted at just over eight dollars, Yet when the charges hit my bank both of them were $15 charges. So then I try to go contact customer support, well unfortunately there is no actual number for you to call, you have to go through this whole online process of finding the perfect topic to choose in order to submit your request. I feel like the customer service is extremely lacking because they don’t give you her direct line through it you can call someone.

I just find it weird that during the coming of this disastrous storm they would steal from peoples accounts and then not even have a number to call regarding the issue.

He said NO because his GPS told him to park by the road outside the fences of my job and he DROVE OFF. The worst part was he didn’t cancel the ride so it looked like he picked me up. I stood there for about 10 mins with no way to cancel the ride and no lyft customer service to contact. I then decided to re-download and set-up Uber which took another 10 mins.

So I sit there asking anyone I know to just simply take me to work because lyft is acting up."
157,Shanayguy,"June 6, 2019",1,"Used to be good Lyft has horrible customer service. I was quite loyal to Lyft given the only other option was Uber. However, Lyft has proven to be challenging to work with in their customer service department. I dislike that there are so many loops one has to jump through to get to a rep. I also dislike that they link you with drivers more than 10 minutes away but say it’s 2 or 3 minutes away. Additionally, I’ve had to wait 30+ minutes on 3 occasions. For which they credit you a $5.... I had to lodge a complaint about one of their drivers for trying to keep me as rider when they were more than 20 minutes away at SFO. I asked that he release me and he said he couldn’t which was a lie because previous drivers have switched me out many times. All Lyft customer service did was say we’ve logged your complaint and you will never be paired with this driver again. Wow. The driver also has a 5.0 rating... despite his harassment to me trying to convince me to wait 20 minutes. Worst off, if you  cancel for something like that, Lyft tries to charge you a cancellation fee!"
158,Shadowinside,"August 18, 2019",5,Prices changes I’ve been using lyft for over than a year  before the prices from my job to my house would be 5 dollars and a few cents although where cases where I would be charge 7 to 8 dollars . Yes I would find that confusing but then I would see that lyft would return the over charge and I appreciate it. Now thought that prices keep changing it’s always from my job to my home at night . There are days where is $5.90  other nights are $6.90 $6.80 $6.78 $6.79 on August 10 was $7.67 and the days after that was $6.78  I’m requesting luxury cars so help me understand why prices keep changing  when I take the same route after work. Yes there have been some instances where some drives take a longer route idk if it’s on purpose or not. I’m just confused about the prices changing each night. Please explain further on this thank you.

160,Raymoore81,"April 6, 2018",1,Thieves save your money & call a cab! Inflated prices every other day it’s a higher price for the exact same distance you previously used. When I first tried this app every thing was easy to book and prices were cheaper than a cab. But then all of a sudden on the 3rd week of using them the problems began. From price gouging to drivers giving themselves tips to now the most recent I book a driver for 3 stops and it’s clearly on the map thing they use. So the driver takes me to the first stop and tells me that the ride is finished and that if I needed them to take me to the remaining 2 stops that I would have to reorder and repay. The worst part about these thieves is that there is no number for you to call and resolve any issues they want 3 part essays sent to an email address that does not respond right away. Boo! In my book that is called a thief! I will gladly be going back to using cabs at least I know for a Fact my small children and I will not have to walk miles in the blazing sun to get to the destination that I paid for!

I contacted lyft to complain about both driver and they both insisted on giving me refunds (one for $11 and the other for $56) now I know it was not their fault but they insisted. They assured me that the money would be on my account in 5-7 days. It’s been 10 days since the first rides refund was “sent out” and I haven’t gotten anything so I’m almost sure that I won’t be getting anything for the second ride.

My first bad experience involved a driver who made multiple racist comments during our ride. I reported this and never heard anything back from lyft. My second bad experience was for a LyftXL for 5 people. Our driver showed up in a car with only seats for 4. He would not cancel the ride, so we had to pay the XL fee even though we only received a regular ride. This left one passenger unsafe without a seatbelt. I reported this to lyft as well, and just got a generic robot response thanking me for the feedback. After multiple replies, I never received more than a super generic response. Customer service is very flawed! We paid $35 extra for the XL ride that we didn’t receive. This happened to me once with the *other* service, and I was reimbursed. Will be sticking with the other from now on, their customer service is much better. I understand that mistakes happen, but your customer service team should be there to make the situation right, and lyft did not do this."
164,Peppah1976,"March 17, 2019",4,"Lyft from Princeton MA to Worcester airport Driver who drove was great and friendly but scheduling the ride in advance with Lyft was confusing. The  day i scheduled the ride it wasn’t confirmed until late at night but not by a specific driver. Then the next day it said it was not confirmed and then wasn’t until about a half hour before I needed to leave for my flight. Then they changed drivers after confirming as if the first person decided it was too far to go. So I wasn’t sure I even had a ride until 26 minutes before I needed to leave. For more than rural areas like princeton there should be some method to assure riders they will actually get picked up. Especially since the service is fairly new to our area. Maybe an email to reassure would be in order. As it was I had to have a backup plan in case Lyft didn’t come through, which some folks might not have the ability to have a backup."
165,Like Gigi ah,"May 8, 2019",5,Customer Service lacking So I used to have a pair of AirPods. I accidentally left them in a Lyft drivers car. I have gps tracking on them so I saw where they were last. I contacted Lyft. I got a stock/canned response. And then was never able to connect with the driver. Now I understand that Lyft is limited in what they can do to the drivers and the driver was a crappy person. I just wanted them to be helpful or at least talk to me about the situation. Instead I got a few responses the first couple days saying they would reach out to me if the driver responded to them. Then when I asked for any update the responses have now stopped? I asked to talk to a person and they shut up real quick after that request. In general I liked Lyft better than Uber but if I can’t even reach some one when I have an issue I can’t support a company like that.

We were charged a $286 damage fee, for according to the driver, a damaged seat belt. We know for a fact we did not damage this mans seat belt. And we knew something was off because the driver seemed irritated when our cell phone fell in the back seat and bounced off the plastic on the door. We apologized to the man and said is everything okay? He scoffed and mumbled under his breathe, rolling his eyes. Upon receiving this fee, we contacted their support team, and they were completely unprofessional and almost unwilling to even listen to our side. They stated their decision was “final”. They didn’t so much as even call us personally to get our side of things, just simply wrote it off as our faults and that was that. We know for a fact that we didn’t damage their seat belt. And honestly, unless you have recording cameras in your vehicle, how is there absolute, definite, concrete proof? Was there riders before or after us and maybe he didn’t notice this?

After a moment of getting the text he arrived we walked around the block and found him on the side of the el Cortez, not and the Uber and/or lyft pickup. Once inside his small ride which was summonsed for 4 people he refused to pick up the other half of our party and told us they have 2 mins to get here where I am. That other half of our party text me that they were outside already even before I had ever received a text my ride would leave in 3 mins. And again he refused to pick up at the correct location which was in the valet and/or registration area.

I’d rather leave 1 star, 1/2 a star or a plus or something available for those who do something extra over what is expected. They might be more courteous than the average driver or drive more smoothly than the average driver or something. I just like to be able to have some way of giving that driver the tiniest bit more credit than the average driver that just does an all-around good job.

After finally finding the car we confirmed the car was for us and got into the car. The driver told us to get out of the car because “we took too long” and he had dropped our request and picked up another ride from another customer.

I checked it and ignored it thinking it was a phishing email. I logged on the app out of curiosity to see if there was a ride. Sure enough, there was a ride that was made and complete from costa mesa California to garden grove California. I contacted them not expecting them to refund me but just to tell them what happened and request that they un-pair my PayPal form the app as I could not find a way to do this on the app. I told them I already deleted the app and just want my payment method un-paired so no one else could take a ride and charge me 28$. All I got was a generic email stating that I took the ride and they can not do anything about the payment and if its fraudulent call my bank. I tried emailing them and saying sternly TAKE MY PAYMENT INFORMATION OFF THE APP. They then spammed me with 14 of the same receipts from the ride in question over the span of 2 minutes, today the 12th of November.

I don’t understand why if I want to rate a driver four out of five stars, the app says “sorry to hear that”, and wants to know what went wrong.  Worse, it won’t let you submit your rating unless your pick something that was bad. Frequently nothing went wrong at all. The ride was fine. But unremarkable. The driver did his or her job. Well. But five stars worth? Cant we save that rating for the drivers who are truly exceptional?  The way the feedback function is designed in the app I bet the overwhelming majority of drivers get five stars because no one wants to bother with the additional work the app requires if you don’t give five stars. Which means there’s no way of differentiating your drivers who are truly unique, talented and special from those who are just fine or ok - just not great."

By that time I am close to $40 out in fares because My average ride is never under 20 bucks which is the whole point of using Lyft is it not ? if you’re running short on time, you call expecting to get to your destination sooner not later. So my question is what is the point of utilizing the service if you cannot get there on time, costing  more than if you were to just deal with the New York City subway service instead. But I guess this is the typical and overall culture in New York, big companies get to take advantage, providing lesser than service, and, the rest of us just have to deal with it and keep paying them.

The explanation is simple - Lyft drivers are able to find out where their customers final destination would be once they get close, and if they think it’s too close, then they drive through departure (which is at a different floor) so Lyft won’t notice and since you can’t see them, you can’t catch the ride and then, Lyft charges you a $5.00 fee.

Yes I made a complaint you can look that up. Never was it responded to or even compensated regrading making the report. Another time it was a full grocery bag of meat fresh from the deli also expensive and very difficult to replace.

I called lyft and was talking to someone and they used the excuse that it was a busy night and that they didn’t have enough drivers. As a rider your safety isn’t a concern of theirs at all.

Well that makes everything okay, causes leaving a rider stranded is there method. I used Uber to get home and got there safely, no thanks to lyft..."
194,notanez,"January 8, 2019",1,"Lyft app did not function properly causing me to waste my money I put in an address to go to my destination and as I got to my destination, I realized that I was arriving to a different destination. I added a stop so that my driver could take me to my actual destination but it would not accept the address I was trying to put in. Lyft kept “correcting” my address but it in fact made it difficult for me to get to my destination. When I went on google maps, the address worked perfectly fine and took me to my desired location unlike Lyft. This goes to show that the address was not the problem, it was the Lyft app. I put the correct address the first time and had to pay extra when it was not my fault, it was the Lyft all’s fault. I deserve a full refund because I triple checked before ever confirming my destination and yet, Lyft still managed to put in the wrong address even though I had the right one. I plugged in the same one on my maps to make sure that I was not wrong. I am just thankful that my Lyft driver was literally AMAZING and helped me out."
195,PDI Corps VP,"February 12, 2019",3,"Pete The gps for the app is not good, at all. I’ve had to call my drive, on multiple occasions, because the gps was not taking them the proper location and freezes frequently, they don’t always know where I’m going so they have to ask. I don’t have that problem with Uber, so I know it’s a software problem. Also, the drivers are allowed to accept jobs from their home. That causes massive delays. An estimated pickup of 7 minuets easily turns into 15 minuets... or even longer at times. This issue, however, I do have with Uber as well. But what Uber does is allowing you to cancel the trip if the wait is longer than first estimated. I had a driver who decided to drop off the previous person (shared ride) before picking me up even though she was supposed to pick me up first, and I had to wait an extra 10 minutes, and of course could not cancel without being hit with a fee even though the driver made the mistake."

198,dezygns,"December 25, 2019",4,"Good app. Reassignment of drivers is confusing. I’ve been using the app sporadically for some months. This week we are in Disney & needed the app frequently to go places where the Disney buses don’t. Today we requested a trip and the driver was reassigned 4 times.  It was confusing because I had never had this happen before. I initially thought two separate drivers were going to come & didn’t want to pay twice! Then another reassignment came in and I ended up texting two of the three drivers.  Neither responded. Finally we cancelled the trip because a bus came. The cancellation fee was waived because as it turns out, traffic was so tight that they were having trouble getting a driver to us. It would have been nice to get better communication about this while it was happening.  I do like tipping directly in the app.  Also like the ease of entering the destination."
199,ParanoidManiac,"August 28, 2019",4,"Lyft service, and improvements For the most part I enjoy using Lyft in due part of the drivers. However this review wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the only complaint that I have. In which a rider is on a shared ride, almost at their destination and suddenly have a notification that a passenger is added, in the other direction. Now I’m normally a person that prepares things ahead of time and try to save money as much as possible, subscribing to the service and utilizing shared saver as much as possible but the service somewhat defeats the purpose of using it if you are only brought in the opposite direction, wasting a lot of time that could be used productively. The only solution I could think of is utilizing a similar system in Uber, in which drivers have the option to exclude who to drop riders. Thanks for listening on to my rant and I hope the service improves!"

The scheduled pickups was convenient feature that was added but taken away stupid move by lyft. Another convenient feature that has now been taken away was the ability to add a second stop to a regular Lyft ride, that was another stupid decision lyft made. I learned this feature was no longer available at 2am when my driver put me out on the street at what would have been my first stop. After being put out I had to request another lyft which led to me spending 10-15min in the cold of night waiting for another driver to complete my trip. Horrible experience. The second stop feature was a great feature for me I could stop and check my P.O. box get back in the same card and continue to my final stop rather that was back home, work, school, doctor, or dental appointment.  The app was just fine before the updates. If it’s not broke then don’t try to fix it. The app was perfect now it’s just an upset"

The first exit miss, he said he was from NY (he was actually driving in a private car with a New York license plate WITHOUT A TLC which is ILLEGAL) and isn’t familiar with the routes in NJ though he had the GPS right in front of him directing him. And on the second exit miss, I then spoke up and found out that HE HAD PUT IN THE WRONG ADDRESS IN HIS GPS!!! I literally put in the correct address when I ordered the ride and all he had to do is copy and paste it but he then stopped on the highway to re-enter the correct address in his GPS. NOT ONLY THAT, but even when I needed to put some small luggage in the trunk, GUESS WHAT? His trunk is all full of drinks and stuff that he seemed to just have shopped and there was barely any space for my stuff. Long story short, he drove an additional 4 miles because of the exits he missed and plus the time wasted to go back. Anyways, I contacted Lyft and asked them for a refund. TERRIBLE experience..."

I feel bad for the drivers with the cancellations too but I’m not about to waste my money AND be late for work.

204,MagMor00,"January 8, 2019",1,Damage Fee I got charged $25 for “damage” that was done to the car. The “damage” was mud all over the carpet from the back seats which is 3. This Fee came as a surprise after a long night at a festival. The lyft driver was parked near a curb right outside the venue where there was mud on one side and dry on the other. I got in through the dry area to not step on mud because My shoes would’ve gotten dirty too. This venue was packed with people so the lyft driver was stepping on it to make some cash for the night at that same venue because it had a lyft pickup station. He filed this “damage” fee hours after I got my ride after he picked up more people from that same venue. Lyft couldn’t provide more info like the time the claim was made and how many more rides the same lyft driver made the same night from the same venue. There was a big amount of mud all over the 3 back seats that couldn’t have been me at all and Lyft decided not to reply back and no refund was made. Guess I’ll have to ride Uber from now on because claims like this aren’t made from drivers for extra cash.

The app offered me an upgrade for a dollar extra with the new customer discount to upgrade to a luxury vehicle. So I said sure why not and purchased the upgrade. Next thing I know I got charged almost $15 for the ride which is bs. I contacted Lyft support and explained my situation. I was presented a certain upfront price of which I expected to pay, and was charged a different price from what was presented. Lyft support just told me the price looks correct. Even if the price was correct it’s not what I agreed to pay. The agent just explained again the price is correct, and before I even have a chance to reply stated if you don’t have any other questions aside from this then have a good day and closed the ticket immediately. I’ve been a customer with Uber for years now and I’ve never had this issue before. My first ride with Lyft and this happens.

Today I was charged for a ride on two different cards and when I wanted to ask about this there was absolutely no way to reach out to them. No hope for a call. The app itself had me message customer service only to be told they can’t call me and didn’t address the issue I was telling them about at all. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I get the “I let them know and they’ll email you end of conversation” text. Their website also only made me fill out a form just to not be reached out about issue I’m dealing with... this app makes it impossible to get customer service or any kind of help. Not to mention two rides before this one I got dropped off at the wrong spot by one and left there in middle of the night, when I tried to get customer service then same results and I gave up due to the frustration.

209,eden and joy,"October 15, 2019",5,"Pleasant and educational experience This is the first time my cousin and I have had the opportunity to ride via Lyft utilizing the self driving system.  Both driver and other person were very knowledgeable informative and accommodating in replying to our questions regarding the automated driving system. We felt safe when the car was in auto mode. It was able to sense the stoplights, pedestrians and even the car that changed lanes in front of us. The only thing that we think needs improvement is to have a gentler manner of braking while on auto mode. It would be more pleasant if the braking was done more gently. We will certainly be willing to try it out again whenever we can.  Thank you for educating us with the positive features of this new way of taking public transportation."

Second, I was a passenger in my friend’s Lyft and this company handled it very poorly.

Lyft’s response was basically that he would get a warning. I filed a hit and run with the police, which is pending. My friend and I both contacted Lyft right after it happened, and I was told someone would be in touch with me. Well, its been 5 days, so Im guessing that theyre trying not to report it to insurance. I had to go to urgent care, and this is not acceptable. Also, my friend is no longer able to access the messages that she sent to the company about this incident through the app. Another barrier to safety is that unlike uber, you are not able to access the license plate number of the drivers.

However, the countdown clock that runs when a driver is waiting to pick me up is stressful and unnecessary. Sometimes, I have to order a Lyft in advance of arriving to the pickup location, this is simply to plan ahead, so I don’t have to wait in the weather for it to arrive. For example, when I’m taking a train somewhere, then I have to arrange a ride from that station to my destination, I’ll order a Lyft and try to time our arrivals to the pickup location. But the time estimates are not always accurate, so the Lyft will arrive before me, and then this countdown timer starts and immediately frustrates me. I’d rather a Lyft driver wait for 6-7 minutes in his/her climate controlled car, than me arrive and wait in the weather for 10 minutes for them to arrive at the pickup.

233,DWXJ,"September 2, 2018",2,"Can’t get a ride back?? Took my wife to Birch Run, MI for our anniversary, just a quick getaway.  For dinner and drinks after we wanted to go to Frankenmuth.  We were able to get a Lyft no problem, ride there was great, driver was cool.  Fast forward to 11:00, tried getting another Lyft back to Birch Run.  No drivers around.  We literally tried for a half hour or more to get a driver with no takers.  My gut tells me there weren’t a lot of drivers in the area in the first place but the application just tells you the rides are full.  Lyft should provide a warning to you if your going to a location that doesn’t have a lot of drivers.  I think that is common sense and more than reasonable.  We were able to get a ride from one of the servers at the bar we were hanging out.  Awesome kid, very thankful for him.  Not thankful Lyft kept us hanging.  Y’all need to step up your customer service.  Riders shouldn’t be left stranded.  At the very least warn us and we can take the risk of not."

Then the drivers refuse to pick up their phone calls or text messages. In some cases im happy they didnt pick up because i reached the point of just cursing them out. They drive past you, and then next thing you know the driver doesnt look like he or she is coming back..... then a ride that was supposed to be 8 mins turns into 48 min wait???"
235,Mz Ria Ria,"October 29, 2018",4,"Reliable yet Unreliable Lyft is reliable in terms of prices in comparison to Uber yet, they are unreliable in terms of driver service. I have had several drivers to cancel on me or not be on time as to when they say they would be. Idk if it’s because some of them are racist and do not want to drive for black ppl, and I say they because the drivers who’ve cancelled on me have all been Caucasian. I have NEVER had an Uber driver cancelled on me. I just feel you shouldn’t been in a public service industry if you don’t want to drive ALL people because that is very wrong, there needs to be a thorough background check of drivers. The only reason they got two stars is because of the lower prices, but as the old saying goes “You get what you pay for” So even though Uber might be slightly higher, it’s worth in terms of quality and reliability."

But the drivers have all been very good to me, very kind and always very professional. I’m grateful for my interactions with them, because I am a people person, and that is important to me. As far as the Lyft app is concerned, I have no complaints. It’s very straightforward to use and I knew my charge ahead of time. Only one small thing; it’s probably obvious how you can change your pickup time, but I was unable to figure it out! But I did communicate my delay to the driver and it all worked out fine. I highly recommend it for anyone, but especially for someone who is skittish, it’s probably the most pleasurable ride you can arrange."
237,DrinaDream,"August 5, 2019",4,Unable to state pickup time Lyft is great! The only issue I have is that you can’t set it up ahead of time or leave the driver a note with the pick up time because they come right away. For a single mom of two who is usually putting my kids to bed and don’t want to have my phone out and checking the arrival time to book  every few minutes or getting ready to leave work and trying to check while trying to finish task at work it gets tricky. This morning I almost got charged an extra $5 because I attempted to put a few minutes after pick up in the driver notes which I got an alert saying he read but the driver still came almost right away. Maybe in the future we will be able to schedule our trip ahead of time and that would make things much easier and this app truly amazing!

For the average person I guess it isn’t, but I’m on a fixed income in an area that has a pretty high cost of living (though nothing like, say, LA or NY). So an average of about $16/ride is a LOT for me. I’m not “close” enough with h my neighbors to ask them to drive me around. I have no friends in this area. There are no family members within several states. My husband very recently left me. So what else am I to do? When one is disabled, options are severely limited!

But rather the APP should alert the passengers that they better verify that this driver will take them I had two rides fail  as I was getting into the car. First one we both agreed to cancel because his EV battery did not have enough range.

There was a promotion after I just downloaded the app and signing in that I would get $5 off for 10 rides. I went to check on something and came back. That promo was gone and nowhere to be found. I have to get to work so I just went through with the first $5 off for the first ride only. Then I enter my debit card saying that they won’t charge you until after the ride. For some reason it didn’t go through so I end up using PayPal. And they end up charging me before my ride got here. I was waiting for a ride then 10 mins later I have a different driver on the way. No complain I actually like the driver and they drive safely on the roads. It is freezing outside now -24 so I’m appreciate they coming out to get me in this weather.

248,Arrrrriiiiiiiiiii,"May 14, 2019",1,Do not ride with Lyft!!!!!!!!!! I do not recommend Lyft drivers are rude and I had a terrible experience with one of their drivers. A women drove me to my work and I accidentally left my key and I followed policy reported it stolen and I contacted the driver by phone and the driver was extremely rude and wa yelling at me saying that I she was working an couldn’t help me but that she did have my key with her. After waiting for some time she said that I had to pay her for gas that was 20 dollars to bring it to me apart from the 10-15 dollars Lyft charges for the return of lost items. The Lyft policy is that they charge 10-15 dollars for the diver to return items it was insane for the driver to want to charge me an additional charge to bring me my key. Then she went on about saying she would only take cash and that I had to decide that day because she was going out of town. After going back and forth with Lyft customer service and the driver I was told my key would be mailed to me months later I never got my key and I was blocked from Lyft.
249,Diva E!,"August 13, 2019",4,"Lyft Review - Mostly Friendly I find that I prefer Lyft to Uber or other transportation services, the drivers are friendly, the cars are clean and well maintained. Mostly positive experiences and in my experience Lyft tends to cost less than Uber (as well as offering promotional savings). There has been a few occasions where it was frustrating that Lyft notified me the driver was there - and the driver was no where to be found and I would call the driver to get clarification and the driver would not answer phone - that is frustrating; or if the driver answered after multiple calls - it was evident that simple communication was an issue (ESL) and I would have to cancel the ride. Lyft has been good about refunding the $5 drop fee when the driver can’t communicate or find your location (this easily happens in places like the Med Center or Galleria area)."

252,Dani dani 12093487,"October 17, 2018",3,1 critical issue I use this app pretty often during the semester and today there was a serious safety issue. My friend ordered a lyft for us and the app said it was a Volkswagen. Then the app said the driver had arrived but instead a Toyota pulled up. It had a different license plate and everything but even when that car looped around the app followed that car. I refused to get in the car given that it had a different plate and model and convinced my friend to cancel the trip. She only hesitated because there was a $5 fee to cancel. We shouldn’t have to pay more money if we feel the driver/ car that arrived is different than what the app displays. It’s also a safety issue in my opinion. I don’t know who to contact about this but I hope this gets taken care of. Both that that lyft driver had a completely different car and that we had to pay for a trip that I felt was unsafe.

In 30 minutes I had 4 drivers not show up or cancel on me.  They have a rule where if the passenger doesn’t show up in 5 minutes, they charge the passenger and the driver gets $10.  This only encourages them to park blocks away and not pick you up- which is exactly what happened to me- twice!  I tried calling the drivers and they didn’t pick up.  I had to take a metro ride home in the rain because it was clear that LYFT WASN’T PICKING ME UP.  This left me feeling abandoned, stuck and like I couldn’t get home.  To make matters worse, THEY DON’T HAVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  I’ve e-mailed with 5 different “customer support” people who just keep telling me that the charges were correct.  I can’t talk to them on the phone, even though I gave them my number, and they won’t reimburse me for the rides that never showed up.  I will never use LYFT again and no one else should!!"

There were a lot of other app ride cars but I was looking for a Jetta. What does a Jetta look like.  No worries. Margarita got out and called my name.  Whew, that was easy. She helped me with my 49 lb suit case. Lol. She was super friendly and made me feel like we were friends. It was a pleasant half hour ride home. Turns out we had a lot in common. I was a little nervous being a female traveling alone after midnight but it was a great experience. I felt totally at ease with Margarita. Five stars all around.

The rides get a bit expensive after the promo expires so cherish the promos!! It’d be nice to get some kind of incentive for frequent users. For whatever reason, the app shows the option to schedule a ride but it doesn’t work. I’ve deleted and redownloanded the app and downloaded the app on someone else’s phone and it didn’t work. The location feature is improving. I’ve had maybe 3 sour drivers and two other drivers(men) who had women with them.

I like 1) the driver often turns up at my house, so I don’t have to walk, which is great 2)I’ve had a couple really nice drivers. On the down side-in the past when I tried Lyft I’d had trouble with Lyft drivers not turning up at the expected pickup spot; or waiting too long to be told where the driver would be, only to suddenly have it announced he was THERE, simultaneously with the location being revealed-3 blocks away. Nerve-racking. Even now I don’t think the routing is always optimized.

I do like Lyft better still but it should focus on being higher quality than the competition instead of getting more drivers without quality control. For the most part the drivers are good but it’s inconvenient to order an Lyft and see the car is dirty and have to cancel and already wait 5 min so have to pay $5 just because i don’t want to sit in a dirty car even tho i have already wasted my time waiting.

I have had three incidents when my driver’s lyft app stated I wasn’t pick up even when I’m sitting in the car already. Some drivers will attempt to take you home although they’re not getting paid for that particular ride. Whereas other drivers will refuse to and then there’s some who will leave their passengers in the car to go outside to hit the pinpoint just to get paid for completing the ride. May I suggest having a system that suggest both the driver and passenger confirming that they are both inside the car possibly. And also you guys should have a phone number to a call center where you can be reached at if something traumatic happens I’m not gonna be eager to type and wait for an email. You guys need to figure out how to beat your competitors or hire me like seriously.

My wait time goes down to 7 minutes, then to 6 minutes, then back to 8 minutes. Then I’m assigned another car that is to arrive in 7 minutes. Same thing again. So I end up cancelling because what initially looked like a pick-up in 2-3 minutes on the map, results in my getting assigned a driver far away with an ETA of 7-8 minutes, that actually is 12-15 minutes, unless they switch drivers on me, in which case I wait even longer.

People are so wrong about their customer service because they’re amazing and every time I have ever had a problem and emailed them they have always resolved my issue going above and beyond. As long as you keep updating the app when it needs to be, it works right. Lyft wait times are usually always quick and reasonable, not to mention the price you pay for your rides are cheap! I hope one day lyft gets even bigger than Uber because the company is amazing! I love lyft, I was always stuck walking all the time commuting to work because cabs are way to expensive. Lyft is a life changer for sure!"

I switched from Uber to Lyft a couple of months ago, use the service at least twice a week, and have never had any issues with drivers arriving promptly and at the correct address. On my most recent ride, I was set to be charged a $5 cancellation fee because the driver supposedly showed up and had to wait more than 5 minutes.  However, HE was the one who never showed, didn’t answer any of contact attempts, and never tried to contact me at all. Lyft agreed to credit me back the $5 and it was much appreciated. With so many of these services these days, it’s almost impossible for them to take accountability and admit to a wrong. Thanks Lyft for correcting something that wasn’t my fault!"

We went back and fourth for 15min. And then he finally did what I asked. Today I needed a ride from the mall I had my sick husband drive me and I told him I’ll take a lyft back. Same thing. I argued with the driver for 15min about where I was. I walked about a block to the opposite side of mall with still no luck.  He didn’t seem to want to move and come to me and I wasn’t sure if I was just walking in circles because the landmarks we were pointing out to each other did not match. Finally I just canceled the ride and asked my sick husband to pick me up. My hubby found me with absolutely no problems. My phone battery was at 19% and ended up at 2% after arguing with the driver.  What a jerk. He wasted both of our time and he lost money."

281,Chess bunko,"July 29, 2018",5,App service Too many times I been waiting for my car and the driver never shows. I can see him going the wrong way and when you call they don’t answer. And if they do answer they ask me to cancel the call. Why should I cancel the call if the driver is the one Not showing up. Also when I do get a car and let say it says 6 minuets after waiting a few minutes now they replace your car with another car and 6 minuets more. Now by the time the car shows up I have already waited over 15 mins. Also some drivers don’t even confirm if it’s the right passenger. It’s happen when they just pick up anyone without asking the name or anything. Service needs to improve or I won’t be using this app anymore.
282,ThaiSinger,"August 3, 2018",1,"Stranded multiple times due to app malfunctions The Lyft app won’t let me change my payment. So, after getting a new debit card, I can’t use Lyft. When I tap “add new form of payment,” it says it has been added successfully. Then when I go back to the home screen I get an error message saying “there was a problem adding your form of payment.” I have checked with my bank and the problem is not on their end. My bank has not even received any attempts from Lyft to charge my account. This is surely a problem with the software of the Lyft app. But when I contacted Lyft about this problem they just said “Its likely a problem with the bank but give it a couple days and try again.” They never even checked with their engineering department or submitted any error reports to have it looked into. That is awful customer service. This problem has left me stranded on more than one occasion when I was depending on Lyft and it has never been fixed."

The first ride my iPhone fell out inside the car unbeknownst to me, or the driver - when I discovered it missing I immediately sent out a ringing alert ping on my iCloud account. The driver heard the phone pinging and drove back to where he left me off. I could see from my computer screen he was close to my house, so I went out to the street and there he was waiting with my iPhone - that’s integrity right there! He could have not returned it - it happened to me once with an airport express ride. But, he returned it and I am one grateful  son of a gun! And yes, I tipped him well and was glad to do it! Thanks Lyft for hiring people who care about their ridership!"

I didn’t believe her, but as I opened my app a few times, my two stops I had requested kept changing and addresses I have never thought to type popped up. I know I had the right address at first because I double checked it 2 times. I noticed it had entered in the house next door, so I changed it before I hit save. Then I double checked it saved it correctly and it had. I then requested an extra stop, and it was a bit confusing at first, but it all worked out. As she told me her side of the sort, I looked at my phone and showed her that I had the two correct addresses in, we compared and they really were different.  Then I get my receipt, and the wrong addresses were entered in. The app charged me way less because of this, so I paid her a 15 dollar tip. Not the best app."

What I got a really big kick out of, was being able to watch the driver in real time on the Lyft App map, while he is on his way to pick me up. Watching the little car moving on the map was way cool! Plus it tells you how many minutes before his arrival while watching the map. So cool! From the time I asked for a pickup in the App, it was about ten minutes before he arrived. The driver was a good guy and it was all around a better than positive experience. Best of all was the rates! I was very surprised at how little it cost to go where I was going, considering the price of gasoline etc., etc..  Hands down FOUR+STARS!"
286,surlycat000001,"December 18, 2018",1,"The worst at locating actual addresses People running the Lyft company, you shld sue whoever programmed your app. It NEVER sends the driver to the location of the address entered. The last *several* times I used this app I had to walk around looking for my driver, who was sometimes a while block off or around the corner of a leave city block, quite a distance from the address entered. 3110 Thomson Avenue in Long Island City Queens, for example, is not in the middle of the very long, heavily trafficked 31st Street. When I’m sick and it’s raining and I call Lyft, it isn’t so I can walk around outside for 10 minutes looking for a guy. When I’m carrying a box of holiday junk from work and call a Lyft to make my way home easier, I don’t want to walk around with my big box of crap looking for a guy. I want the car to come to the address. You are losing me as a customer and hurting your drivers and by extension you are hurting your own business. Wise up. I’ll be using Arro from now on. Bye."
287,druiz44,"February 27, 2019",2,"Going down hill I’ve been using Lyft religiously to and from work nearly everyday and as of late the app has been horrible. I rarely give bad reviews, in fact I always give 5 stars unless the driver really does something that’s unacceptable. I gave 1 bad review, the drive stopped at Walgreens before picking me up while I was waiting I could see the car stopped at my local Walgreens which is only 2 minutes away. It took the driver 10, because he made a stop and I was late for work. So I wrote a review and gave only a few stars. After that, I don’t get paired with a driver quickly and when I do, they’re 8-10 minutes away which has NEVER been the case. I’m disappointed, and feel the company has lost tough with its customers, the same customers that left Uber for something better. Moral of the story is, I’ll be going back to Uber. At least they respond to poor reviews and will look into incidents."

My last week has been particularly frustrating. I waited in Raleigh Durham for a Lyft. Put my bags in the trunk and buckled up. But when the driver realized I was going to Burlington, he got out of the car and got my bags out and told me he wouldn’t drive that fat because he would drive back empty. The Lyft app offers NO OPPORTUNITY to report him. He canceled the ride and I had to start over. This morning I scheduled a Lyft for 5:20am. At 5:15 I was notified that my driver was 25 minutes away. The driver who accepted the ride on Saturday changed his mind. Again, the app left me NO OPPORTUNITY to report the incident. I had a flight to catch. At 5:20 am I should not be stressed out over a ride to the airport. I am extremely disappointed but complaining with the good drivers who fixed the situation is an unfair process ."
289,cjkar94,"October 9, 2019",4,Rude Usually I have awesome drivers. Sometimes if I have an emergency or need to get home when it’s late and I have my kids sometimes drivers cancel and I get that. But they cancel so I don’t get charged and can get them home. Tonight I had a very rude driver. Randell. He refused to take us home and he also refused to cancel the ride and made me get charged. I asked him kindly to please cancel and he said he wasn’t going to and was going to wait so id get charged. It’s 825 pm. It’s just so very rude to make me get charged for a 22$ ride. When I have my kids. You have to be heartless to have the person get charged. So disrespectful he was. I can’t report him or make a report on his rude disrespectful behavior since he waited the 5 mins to charge me for not being there thou I was. And lyft has no call number which is so inconvenient.
290,LadyB238,"March 15, 2018",5,"Great service I use the service twice a week to go to a class about 20 miles from my residence. The drivers are very professional, very helpful, and they enjoy chatting and meeting new people. I’ve met lots of interesting and great drivers, and one of them has become a close friend. I pay very fair amount, and I am totally blind, so a Lyft ride to the grocery store doesn’t cost me a whole bunch out of pocket. The driver waits for me patiently as I enter and exit the vehicle as it takes me a little bit of time since I’m completely blind. Bus stops are kind of hard to get to from my residence, so this is a great alternative and doesn’t cost a whole lot. If you have the money , a right is very convenient and just a tap away on a smart phone. Great service."
291,sdkca1949,"September 4, 2018",5,Customer service Lyft looks out for me.  I’m in a strange city with an odd driver — Lyft takes care of me. If I’ve had a good experience— Lyft let’s the drivers know.  And with a bad experience Lyft takes care to settle the account and deal with the driver.  It is miles and away the easiest online ride share app and I don’t have to spend all my time doing nonsensical data entry.  I know where and who my driver is at all times and the payment structure works great. They know where I am and where I’m going as an extra. It seems like they treat their drivers better than other companies too.  I’m a 70 year old woman who has been using Lyft all around the nation for about five years.  I’m committed to them over any other ride. I’d take a taxi before I’d use Uber.
292,Mel Mir,"December 9, 2018",5,"It’ll get you a ride. But there’s some issues. My last couple of rides were too close. For instance, when I am to chose a ride, I pay very close attention to the ETA of both Uber and Lyft’s pickup and drop off times. Also the rate. Sometimes, Lyft states that they’d be faster. But that MAY NOT be the case. So when I agree to Lyft’s ETA and press the confirm button, the ETA changes dramatically! Not at all what I had agreed to. Then when I try to cancel, I can’t. There isn't an option to do so. So next thing I try to do is try to find customer service, and find out that all I have available to use, is email service. So this is my only issue I have with Lyft. Hopefully they can fix it. Cause I like to have both options (Uber and Lyft) available."

I was given promos and instead of being charged the price it said it would be after the promos were applied, I was charged the full price of every ride instead. Only two of those many rides had the extra money that was taken off put back into my regions account!!! There are yet still 3 pending charges that the money have not been added back on from these discounts lyft gave me! Do better!!! Fix the issue to where if you give people discounts on their ride, the system will only take off the exact promised amount. Not the whole original amount as though the promo was never applied then try and put the extra money taken back into people’s bank accounts !! This is just messy and ridiculous !"

Didn’t realize it was shared until after I was in the car and stopped to pick someone up and drove all over Seattle in Friday commute traffic.  This was extremely stressful, I got car sick and cut it way to close to flight departure.  If direct rides aren’t available it should stay this, especially for people going to airport.  It took three times as long to get to airport and it was beyond stressful!!!  The driver had to drive like a bat outa XXX to get me there on time but the app should be more clear!!!"

I was able to watch the little car icon as it traveled the five minutes for my pick up, the drivers name was on my screen. When he arrived, he rolled down his window, and politely introduced himself. He was driving an SUV that looked to be extremely clean and to be a recent year model. I’m very tall and he had adjusted the seat before I got in the vehicle. All our conversation was friendly and upbeat. It was a little bit like having your next-door neighbor pick you up and take you home."

I really like Lyft as my best option to go without my car, when I have to do it, also the best price, promotions and I really like the service. The app is a little confusing to make “future reservations”, it doesn’t show you when you’re done and you can mistakenly make another one because it doesn’t tell you, you are done!. That happened to me and I don’t want to get extra charges or make someone to go to pick me up by a wrong reservation made in the app. I wish the app finishes the process of the future reservation saying 1“you have a reservation plan at ..,” "

That changed today when I left my phone in the car. I wasn’t home so I didn’t have access to my computer. It was really hard to get a hold of customer support. The website kept directing me back to the app. Basically we had to Google the phone number. Hold time was insane. It was about 45 minutes after I left the phone before we could get a human on the line and then they kept insisting they wanted to text me information. The driver was a total sweetheart and ran the phone back to me when she realized she had it, no thanks to the company. Of course I tipped the crap out of her. :-)"

My ride arrived at the wrong pick up location because the app did not register my actual location.  I had to call her to explain that I wasn’t there. So I had to direct her over the phone around the streets I live in. It was so inconvenient because the drive had another two passengers with her and they were in a time crunch. I felt embarrassed. This is highly unacceptable. I’ll return to Uber next time. Uber has never disappointed me and allows for easier communication directly from the app."
302,LoniNai,"August 6, 2018",5,"Great....but some new updates are tiresome I love Lyft use them all the time. The only issue is that prior to the update I would schedule a pick up every morning for work and if by chance a driver cancelled a new one would be sent automatic just like when you order a ride for immediate pick up. Now though if an appointment is scheduled and the driver cancels  mins before, the app now requires you to request a new driver. For most this isn’t a big deal but because I live in an area where Lyft drivers aren’t readily available it’s rough especially if I’m not near my phone at the time of the driver cancels an am unaware then at by that point I’m struggling to get a ride to work. But I still love the convenience and the prices cheaper then Uber for sure."

What I don’t like is the misleading (and sometimes downright untruthful) deals and discounts they run. I downloaded the app originally because I saw an ad on Facebook offering $50 free ride credit. When I got everything running, all I had was $5 credit. After contacting Lyft several times and getting no response, I deleted the app. Here we a couple months later, and I redownloaded it after getting and email boasting 50% off your next 10 rides. Well, that’s not entirely true, because the most they’ll let you save per ride is $10. Ok fine, whatever. But, one of my rides from today was only $15, and they still charged me $9 after the discount. I don’t know who’s doing the math or how they’re doing it, but it’s shady.

I scheduled my ride 3 days ahead and the morning of, it was reassigned twice, gave me notification the driver was there, then rescheduled again - ultimately leading to me needing to make an unnecessary 40 mile trip because I wasn't able to be where I needed to be. While all of this can be chalked up to bad drivers - the customer service team is IMPOSSIBLE to get a hold of. There is no number, just an option to have them call you (they wont) alternately, you can email them (but this process is convoluted, hard to get an exact reason that matches the complaint) and they generally don’t respond.

So even though Uber was cheaper next time I will still use Lyft because of the driver being so dang on weird an quiet he smiled at the end an turn as if I was going to tip him NOT. I’d rather pay more to be comply so Thanks Lyft for having such nice drivers but I’d love it if u compare your prices cause Uber is wining in that department.

307,NY quitter,"April 5, 2019",5,"Cheaper & better than Uber now. I generally took uber until I noticed that their prices seemed to go up SIGNIFICANTLY. Now I always compare uber & lyft & lyft is generally $7ish dollars cheaper for a $25-$35 dollar ride. That’s a lot. The final straw was my last Uber ride showed that the ride started before she got to the house. I didn’t know what happened but when I looked at the bill it was much higher than the quote & Uber wouldn’t do anything about it. Now I exclusively take Lyft. Most of the drivers I talk to also like Lyft better. Lately, Lyft sends me coupons but they’re cheaper even without using them. "

Yesterday I was trying to get to work and the person who picked me up chose such a inefficient route that I was over 10 minutes late when I called them half a hour before I needed to be there (it's just over half an hour's walk from my house, and maybe a 10 minute drive). However, lyft feels that the $11 they charged me for this ride is fair and are not going to refund me despite making me late for work (which, if any of you work retail, you know that lateness is basically verboten).

It’s difficult to use the app when it changes to me so often. I understand updates need to be made from time to time but if Lyft would make a greater effort to try and keep the app is similar in appearance from the last update that would be greatly appreciated because it can be very intimidating to turn the app on that you’re used to using and then it’s very different and you trying to get a ride to the hospital or have a Lyft pick your mother up from the airport because you can’t get away from work or whatever it is.

I was assured by a few individuals that Lyft goes beyond measure to assure the safety of those in need of a ride. Our driver was absolutely amazing! He proved everything I heard previously to be true! His vehicle was so clean. The AC was on. We felt chauffeured indeed!!! James wasn’t weird! If he played music at all it wasn’t awkward. He didn’t drive with a road rage, crazy shifting lanes, not looking, or texting while transporting type of mindset. Giving this beautiful human being a tip came so easy. He handled my daughter and I like pearls. I can’t express my thankfulness enough for Lyft as well as the driver. This is top notch service. Thanks y’all! 😊"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because if you live in a big city they charge you less money if it’s just you for a ride but if you live in a small city and a lot of people don’t use it they charge you 5 times the amount for just 1 person and they don’t give you the option to pick if it’s just 1-2 people for the ride they have it for up to 4 people when it’s just you riding. I don’t think it’s fare and I understand it’s people jobs but paying over 60 a week to get to and from work just for 4 days is a lot. But it’s good and will get you to wherever you need to go and all of the drivers are nice except for 1 George from Florida he is a scammer.
318,Joe123412345,"November 5, 2019",1,"They hire dangerous drivers and don’t care After making my friend and me wait for a half hour, their driver cancelled in front of my face so she could take advantage of surge pricing and take a more expensive ride. The driver was rude and defiant in the process. I contacted Lyft and they couldn’t have cared less. We had to stand in freezing cold temperatures for another 45 minutes until an Uber, not Lyft, driver came to pick us up which created a dangerous situation. I understand this stuff happens with big companies, but to not take any responsibility after the fact and basically ignore the dangerous situation their driver created is the definition of corporate immorality. I would highly recommend using a different method of transportation. This company is beyond irresponsible. Also, how much does your shady company pay apple to keep your app rating at 4.9 stars (all you have to do is look at all the horrible reviews of this sketchy company to tell this is an inaccurate farce)?"
319,Magrubey,"March 5, 2020",1,Awful in app support Attempted to go to the airport. Selected the airline from the list and ordered the ride. Driver took me to a police enforced restricted area in the back part of the airport and expected me to get out. Mentioned on ride that it didn’t look like we were headed towards the terminal and he responded with “I am following this gps to the location I was given” and kept driving. Then once we got to the middle of nowhere he made me change my drop off location. It charged me more money and made me late to the terminal. I reached out to support and they said I changed the drop off location so it was my problem. I explained that it was not my intention to change the location and the entire situation again and they said I entered the address wrong. I explained I chose from a dropdown and still it was my fault and problem. Worst customer service experience. You don’t blame the customer when it’s very clear it was an app/gps/driver issue.
320,Sallsberrrryyyy,"January 10, 2018",2,"Seriously gone downhill It really bums me out because I like Lyft as a company, but it looks like I’ll have to go back to Uber. Lyft Line is consistently pairing me with people who are completely out of the way of my (and their) destinations, pairing me with drivers too far away when there are plenty of others that are closer and an overall decline of decent drivers. "
321,LadyFresh_1220,"January 31, 2018",5,"Wait time and cancel fee too high I been using this app for about a month and have an issue. Several times I had to wait over 10 minutes for a Lyft it started out with a 8 minutes wait and then switch drivers 2 times the wait was way over the actually wait for a driver. couldn't cancel my ride since they charge $8.99, there is nowhere within the app to call customer service or talk to a live rep. Today January 31st I took another lyft and the driver, within the app, stated he was at the location which I was standing and when I called he was three blocks away. No compensation and again couldn’t cancel because of the charge. I think I might have to stick it out with Uber."
322,(Cookie,"July 26, 2018",1,Was it working so well that you trashed it? When I first started with Lyft the drivers were vetted. Not only were they required to speak English but they actually had to endure a visual inspection of their vehicle and drive another vetted Lyft driver. Today anyone can join with just a background check. Lyft is moving away from safety and that short cut will be it’s down fall. Tuesday I had a driver who didn’t speak English. Not so bad except he got lost and I didn’t know what language he spoke. Normally I use google translate because this is all too common in Boston- getting lost-because Boston wants to be extra with it’s Street logistics. But I had no idea what language the guy spoke and missed my appointment. Lyft gave me a ride credit but I would rather that they go back to vetting their drivers and since a lot more people are driving who are learning English maybe they should take a helping them learn and give them with a tool to translate to the country’s language!
323,Nickname: Create,"December 23, 2018",5,"Phenomenal I cant speak more highly about Lyft. It’s a truly ideal, convenient and professional service, and it couldn’t be easier to use. Perfect for anyone that is in need of immediate transportation, or even consistent, general transportation. It’s especially niche for anyone that lives, works, and or spends a considerable amount of time in areas that are remote, and lacking in a regular, local forms of public transportation, that’s available 24/7. My experience with Lyft has been absolutely phenomenal, not just then and again, but again and again. I couldn’t be happier with my decision to try Lyft, and I will continue using their services henceforth. Thank you Lyft for the wonderful experience that you’ve continuously provided me with."

Or ride so many times and get a free ride would make me happy to use on a long distance ride if needed. At a time I can save like 5 free rides or when I really need them. Also I don’t like having to sign in with phone numbers and email verifications because I’ve had so many new phones and updates things get lost or unobtainable/hard to retrieve. Mostly I like the services. Where in my car declines I have to re-sign up with the card all over again sometimes my phone is dying and it’s very annoying I would like to be able to continue to use my card even if I declined the first time second time third time I have a lock on my card when I’m not using it so confusion happens once in a while
325,creative guru,"January 3, 2019",5,Wrong Card Charged Love using Lyft and have been a loyal customer since 2016. I’m sad to give a lower rating but I have been running into a issue a couple of times that has been frustrating. I have 2 payment options I use for Lyft. One is my personal card and another is my company card. I always check on which card is being used since I have both. I recently been seeing issues where I select a payment and then it defaults back to the wrong card. Which turns out to be my company card. This has caused major difficulty to continuously refund my company for such small amounts and they the process to refund them is difficult to do. Wish this wasn’t an occurrence in the app.
326,SCAMMER DRIVERS,"February 8, 2019",1,"Beware of scamming drivers I was scammed by a driver on New Years Eve. A driver told Lyft that I threw up in his vehicle on NYE which was a complete lie because I haven’t even gotten to the party where the drinks were, the driver was driving me to the party. So I was completely sober during my ride and I had a witness to prove it. However, the driver provided fake photos to Lyft of vomit therefore it was my word against Lyft and of course Lyft favored the driver. Lyft then charged me a $100 cleaning that I refuse to pay and now I no longer use Lyft I use Uber. Please bare in mind I am also a Lyft driver. All in all beware of these drivers, this is a scam that drivers use often when they have a passenger they make like. They keep these old photos of throw up and just send a email to Lyft and then Lyft gives them a $100 clean reimbursement. It’s complete bs because if you don’t take photos as a passenger there is no way to win the case because the driver has photos and you don’t. BEWARE OF THESE SCAMMING LOW LIFE DRIVERS!"

This Easter Sunday no cabs were available for 45- 1 hour so got a Lyft, it pinged letting us know he was at our home but he was no where to be found. We were down to have him speed by three mins early from down the street no where close to our location. I tried calling since he was leaving early and was at the completely wrong house for him to refuse to pick up. My boyfriend was a hour late into work and written up and I lost my intire shift and holiday bonus. When I contacted asking to be compensated I expected ten percent off all rides for may or equal compensation for our loss for me to be issued a five dollar credit which wasn't even half the cost of the ride. When I emailed them back telling them how underwhelming that was I was blatently ignored. No longer a customer and wouldn't recommend them."
328,DORIS the CNA,"June 17, 2019",1,"I RATE LYFT AS A NEGATIVE 5 STAR RATING When I booked the ride ... the window that accepts the ride payment opened up. I entered the CORRECT CREDIT CARD information to charge the ride to. LYFT decide to ignore the Credit card number, expiration date, and CVW and charged the fees to my personal credit card. I am a CNA and was helping my 90 plus year old client get a ride to the airport to meet her deceased husband’s body. She needed to catch the flight with her husband of 64 years, that passed away hours ago, to get them back to NJ for the funeral. I have emailed countless times over 2 days and get back the “sorry, but we cannot help you and charge the correct card accordingly” message. WHY IS THERE A WINDOW TO ENTER THE CREDIT CARD data when they use another card already on file. This smacks of credit card fraud. I’m changing my CREDIT CARD number right now! "
329,Jcm302,"January 23, 2020",1,Beware of High drivers I was picked up by a Lyft Driver that has obviously high but don’t know what substance. I was asked by her if she could get gas right after I got into the car. I thought it was strange but obliged. I asked her if she could find one that was on the way. She used her GPS system to find one but still got lost and missed the exit. After she filled up we started to head out and I left the rest to the driver. During that time I was in my phone and did not notice her driving IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION on the freeway of my destination and pretty much at the same location. I told her to stop and let me off as soon as possible as I felt pretty uncomfortable staying in the vehicle. I immediately called LYFT and all I got was an “investigations”. I also still had to pay for the ride that left me nowhere and back at the same area. Never again will I trust this company or it’s employees. Please is Uber never once had any issues with drivers.
330,Tanisha10,"June 2, 2018",5,"Highly disappointing! This app is based on such bad engineering! The new update is too much to handle for the app itself. You ain’t just upgrade UI, you need to level up your game from back end too. My experience at 2am on a good weather night in Boston has been pathetic - I waited for a car which could not be tracked just when a minute was left and then they switched to another car, same happened and then third car was coming on my way and yet again it would vanish, that’s when I cancelled, uninstalled and started hating the app. It won’t be too long until people will only use uber and not try to save few bucks and waste whole bunch of time. I am very, very disappointed in Lyft."
331,NurseBea,"August 25, 2018",4,"Great Transportation Option! I like Lyft quite a bit. Living in a big city, it’s rare I have to wait more than 3-4 minutes for a ride. Drivers are usually very nice and I like the options for tipping (or not) as well. My only complaint is when there’s a particularly bad driver, there’s no option to rate them zero stars, so you have to give at least 1 star. Then, the one time I did that, nobody contacted me to find out what happened (but they did contact me the time I rated someone just 3 stars... go figure!). I had to pay for the guy(driver) who was a complete jerk of a driver (and, if I cancelled mid-ride, my loss - but I still needed to get to the destination, so I had no choice!). "
332,Doc Stephie Rae,"September 11, 2018",4,"Nice option to get ride in a pinch Drivers were nice, one car needed a good vacuum. one day I saw several cars nearby for pick up, in a hurry I chose the closest one, but then it disappeared. So I requested another, eta20 minutes, got ready and 20 minutes later that car was 21 minutes away, so I requested again and they gave me another driver 20 minutes away when there was one closer, so I turned down that ride because they were too far away and picked one closer, knowing I was already going to be 15 minutes late for work. Maybe it was operator error and I didn’t confirm the drivers or something but dang they could make the app idiot proof. Even one driver couldn’t figure out he had to confirm that he picked me up so we get his gps to navigate to my destination!"

335,Rubybz,"October 22, 2019",5,New customer I’m two rides into doing business with Lyft and have been pleased with their service.  The communication to their customers and their drivers is admirable.  I had scheduled a ride to O’Hare Airport two days before my departure date.  I was a bit nervous if this would work.  Lyft communicated with me via notifications of receipt/confirmation of my request.  I was prepared and ready to go at the scheduled time when I received a notification of when the driver would be at my home.  It was 20 minutes later than requested.  After five minutes I received a notification that another driver would be there within minutes!  Great!  The detailed info on the driver/vehicle is much appreciated!

I have been denied multiple times to speak with a supervisor. I have been lied to multiple times by the call center and not allowed to speak to a supervisor or manager. My Lyft driver kicked me out of her vehicle in the rain on a busy highway after refusing to follow the gps. After requesting her to follow the gps she became irate a violent. Using profanity and making threats. Which at that time I was forced physically to exit the car to avoid any other physical altercation. After such the driver tried to make me get in the car which I refused to do I would like this issue resolved and I would like the driver terminated because of her reckless action and complete disregard for customer/ client safety. I would like the matter resolved or I will be forced to get a lawyer involved about Lyft drivers putting their riders in dangerous situations.

Notification at 5:30 that he was arriving inn1 minute, no car license # or phone #. No Lyft. Next notification was that he was about to leave - he had been on the next block, while I was out in front. Without a driver phone, you can’t communicate with Lyft, either to get confirmation or let them know of problems. They’re just an app - drivers should get the lion’s share if they can’t facilitate better communication."

My recent one I was almost charged(got my money back thankfully) $30 for a normal $10 trip and I know that because I done from and to many times(both ways) and reason it was $30 because he didn’t stop my trip after he drop me off and drove another 40 minutes to a place that was like 15 minutes probably from my original spot. Then I had a driver who I felt was driving unsafe. Kept driving past stop signs and even could of hit us with a lower bridge if it didn’t stay up luckily. It even said to stop after it and still didn’t do that. Then I had a driver who I was waiting for said he picked me up but I wasn’t even in car or near location and it’s hard to find Lyft or anyone I should say in that matter to get picked up so of course I had to cancel him and ask for a new one.

She started having some minor new/different complications so we decided to call for a ride. John was able to calm her as he explained that he too had some cardiac medical issues. It really soothed her to know that she isn’t the only one going through these things. John was a very safe driver and extremely respectful. The only thing I would change about the ride is that he took the long way home when we were  about a mile away. The ride took 5-7 minutes and it could have taken just 2 minutes. No complaints though. John was wonderful.

I believe you were made aware of this. After almost three hours of waiting. I went on line and signed up for myself. At the age of 93 I managed to get connected with Cindy and finally arrived at my daughters home. I believe you have made a correction in your information and any of your drivers in the future will find the front gate of the complex on Junipero st next to the Costco parking lot not on Willow.

344,Shaylaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,"January 10, 2019",2,"*** I have never had an issue with Lyft until I was recently charged $15 for a “damage fee” when I didn’t even do the damage. If the driver says that you did something to their car, then you did it no matter what. They automatically take the money off of your card. They do not reach out to you or anything before doing it. Lyft is very easy and convenient, but be really careful and pay attention to everything and check behind yourself because you can easily be lied on by the driver and the money goes straight into their pockets. Even take before and after photos if you wanna be a little extra. I contacted support and everything and they did nothing. I was charged for no reason. $15 May not seem like much, but when you end up having to pay a driver $26 after one, less than 12 minute, single ride(for no reason), it seems crazy."

This was my first time using any ride share app, and I saw a notice in the app that indicated I would be notified when a driver accepted my schedule. However, I became a little worried after not receiving a notification before my 8:30 am schedule. Since I was headed to catch a flight at the airport, I almost grabbed a nearby cab, when suddenly at 8:30 am the app notified me it was trying to find me a driver. Now that I understand better how it works, I won’t be anxious next time. Although, it would be nice to have a notice at least 10 minutes before so you’re not thinking something’s wrong and your ride is not coming."
346,Disgruntled in Minneapolis,"March 2, 2019",3,"Lyft not as it once was Reliability for a very avid rider of Lyft has become a thing of the past. In the past month alone I have been late for work far too many times as a direct result of a scheduled ride (1 hour in advance mind you) that has blown up in my face. I completely missed work on one occasion. It is not because there are no drivers, that would be understandable. It is because the drivers I initially get, for some unknown reason will be switched to another much farther away driver, over and over, until I am now 15 minutes to a half hour late. This is unacceptable. I have switched back to the more expensive and less driver friendly Uber for most of my scheduled rides to and from work, simply because I cannot rely on Lyft in Mpls., and will continue to do so until the Lyft app stops burning me."

We have always relied on Lyft as we’ve convinced others to do the same. We took a Lyft for my husband’s birthday, the following day, we got a “$100” damage fee for “vomit” in the car. Mind you, we are all in our thirties, responsible adults, and would NEVER vomit in someone’s car! Completely out of all of our characters, we’re not children. When disputing with Lyft, which was very aggravating since there’s no direct number, my husband asked them to send photographs WITH the time stamp marked on the photo to show proof it was us. Once he asked for that, they stopped responding (it’s even 3 weeks). Lyft not only lost my husband and I which were loyal members, but also the other passengers  as well as our friends who we shared our experience with. We will never take Lyft again and will continue to share our experience with others."
349,NinjutsuDrew,"January 22, 2020",1,Lyft can charge you up to $250 for damages without anyone having to prove you caused it. Every ride is a gamble.  Their Terms of Service indicate that when you use the platform you agree that all a driver has to do is report damages and you will be charged up to $250. It does not matter how those damages occurred.  All the driver has to do is upload a photograph and your account will be charged.  It is at the sole discretion if Lyft.  This is terrible policy and you should not want to use a company with this type of predatory language in its ToS.

Recently, I moved back to a big city and didn’t have a car so I needed to start back up. When I tried to order my first one, it said my account had been suspended and to contact support. I emailed them and it took a week to get a response. And when I did, all it said was “we’re sorry we can’t reopen your account.” I replied asking if I could have an explanation as to why and all they said was that legally, they couldn’t give me any information and I was no longer allowed to use the platform.

The company needs to train its drivers to be sensitive to things like frustration (the kind that is not their fault), headache, long day, etc, as well as stressing the importance of a clean, dependable vehicle. This can be done and everyone, including drivers, will find each transaction a little more seamless and satisfying. I love the idea of having a ride at my fingertips and for reasonable prices. I might, depending on how tariffs affect leasing prices, just drop my car and Uber or Lyft everywhere.

Lyft was my go to driving service only cuz I would have more chances to find a female driver versus Uber however lately it’s been ridiculous. Every time I would cancel my ride in hopes to get a female driver the next I would get a fee for canceling the ride and that adds up so much to the point where the fee would cost more than the ride! Now I get they do background checks and junk but as a female who has major anxiety being in a car alone with a strange male with the possible outcome that the ride won’t be safe does not sit well with me! Not only have I heard stories of female passengers being in danger by a male driver I was one of them as well. I shouldn’t have to pay for multiple fees for being safe than sorry! Lyft needs to get it together and find a way where female passengers can only request a female driver if they do not feel safe about being in a car with a male driver!
359,May 53,"February 16, 2020",4,"Better prices, better service... adios, Uber! Without fail rides have been less expensive than any other rideshare company AND the drivers have consistently been polite, prompt  and respectful. 4 instead of 5 for a few reasons: 1) You can’t call or text your approaching driver. (Yes, it’s illegal to talk/text while driving. But when they’re lost or about to leave as you’re coming toward them, the ability to reach them would be very helpful!) 2) No gift cards (for the friend you want to help but can’t be trusted with cash!) and 3) Shared “search” time.. do i have 2 minutes or two seconds until it tells me to be 4 blocks away? Never know! (Way less than awesome).      All things considered, Lyft is still miles ahead of the game."

362,vnvm,"February 17, 2019",2,"Why can’t any rideshare app be honest about arrival times? This is a problem with Lyft and its biggest competitor, but seemingly a bigger problem with Lyft. The “your ride will arrive in” times are widely and likely intentionally underestimated. It’s not uncommon to wait 10-12 minutes for a ride that’s “1 minute away.” And in many cases, they’ll cancel and you get to start over again. To add insult to injury, you’re given no more than 5 minutes to find them, cross the street (because they often can’t be bothered to come directly to you), and get in their car- under threat of a “no show” fee. Lyft needs to be better about respecting its riders’ time. I understand the desire to make your service seem faster than it is because you don’t have as many drivers, but just be honest. And don’t fine us after we’ve been waiting for longer than 10 minutes."

PLEASE create an option to BLOCK a DRIVER due to conflicts of interest. I don't want to be assigned with him ever again and if this has happened to me, I'm sure it's happened to others out there. I know there's the option of giving 3 stars or less at the end of a ride to avoid having a driver again, but there's no way I'm getting in a car with him in the first place, so I need another option that's user friendly. I want to feel safe using Lyft, so how about updating the app to take into account that a passenger might already know a driver and not feel safe getting a ride with that driver."
364,Unhappy Lyft Rider,"February 15, 2020",1,Horrible Service in Davenport Florida I entered a pick up and destination location less than 10 miles away.  The app said the first driver was only 3 minutes away and then the app said it found another driver about 13 minutes away.  The second driver got lost about halfway there.  She did not respond to many text messages or phone calls even when the app showed the car stopped on a dead end street.  I canceled the ride after about 15 minutes passed and no apparent progress in getting back on the proper route.  The app showed the next driver also stopped making progress about half way. After the app kept finding several more drivers at least 15 minutes away I gave up and scheduled a round trip ride to meet my wife and return to the final stop.  Took over an hour and forty minutes to get my wife to a destination that should not haven taken more than thirty minutes.

I have reported this issue like three or four times already. Each time I get some BS about how it’s not Lyft’s fault, but google maps, or waze. But the truth is that the ONLY time this is EVER an issue is when the map and directions being used are in the Lyft app. I can’t upload a screenshot because there’s no app feedback available.

I rely on Lyft and Uber to get to and from work and most of my paycheck goes into these two apps unfortunately. I requested a ride and due to the high number of customers no one was able to pick me up which would be alright if they didn’t take the money for the ride which I never got. No company should be able to withhold the money YOU make for their services and not offer what they promised. This isn’t anything wrong with the drivers but with their services. As I was writing this I was given a measly $5 bonus credit which is barely a 3rd if what’s needed to get to my work. Wouldn’t recommend and Uber is a much better alternative. If you can’t get a ride from them they at the very least will not withhold your hard earned money from you."

I’ve never had a bad experience with any of my drivers and the app has never jipped me with money unlike other ride apps. I’m completely satisfied though I wish I would get promos... I don’t think I ever have and that’s truthfully the only thing Uber has on Lyft. I don’t ride much so maybe that’s why but definitely try Lyft our if you’ve only ever used other parties!!!

For the amount of hours these people work for you, you would think you’d treat them better. You basically kill yourself and for next to nothing. Do not do this unless you have your own car otherwise you will be over paying for a subpar car you’ll never own (gas sold separately). This is the perfect scam and basically slavery.

I’ve been sitting here waiting for 20 minutes for my driver who was supposedly 6 minutes away when I scheduled the ride. This has happened the last 5 or 6 rides I’ve called. Not only that but all of my rides are $15 or more to go 3 miles or less in Denver. I’ve even been charged $30 for a ride less than 3 miles! Not only that but for some reason the GPS system constantly wants the drop off location to be in back alleyways.

The driver flew by us and immediately I got the message that the driver reported to the system “The passenger didn’t show up” and I was charges $10. Immediately my friend started to contact the customer service to communicate the situation. We never got a response.

Am getting late to my destination and the drivers are confused with the app and gps. I need to be contacted since there is no apparent place to voice a complaint or to request a call back. What’s the use of having a automated voice to tell you your not speaking to a person and there is no way to do so.  This makes no sense. Your trying to blame the driver for a defective service and app. All around can’t wait for Florida bct. To get better buses and more of a nyc transportation Scheme the system you have is it so terrible it’s scaring me and the person or passenger that I placed in your drivers care this is becoming ridiculous I think live needs to man up and give them the rider or the passenger more control and opportunities to request or talk or feedback simply put the app stinks I think Lyft is pulling a scam and you can’t blame everything on your drivers
380,bagboii,"August 23, 2018",3,"Accountability For every great experience with Lyft I’ve had many terrible experiences. My biggest complaint is Lyft’s ability to hold riders accountable. Far too often I have drivers cancel and charge me a $5 fee rather than completing my trip. I’ve had riders accept my trip and drive in the opposite direction & tell me to cancel (which also results in a $5 fee). When you report to Lyft most times they’ll credit your account. Which is also frustrating. Rather than refunding you, they give you a $5 credit which means in you HAVE to continue to use the service even after having bad experiences. This is also unfortunate for the next driver because they won’t get paid because of another drivers actions. I wish Lyft would hold their riders accountable and have better customer service."

For the sake of not having to submit additional information, I had rated someone a 5 to avoid this. Realistically, I wouldn’t want to do that again in the future (just to stay honest to the service.) I also wish there was a way to provide feedback and tips to drivers at another time (not right after drop off).

I know driver’s prefer Lyft, but I’ll be damned if Uber doesn’t provide a better overall experience. Lyft drivers seem to have to ability to cancel rides and just eff you over in general while Uber drivers seem to honor the rides they accept and arrive after accepting the rides. Lyft drivers accept rides and then go get gas after accepting. Or they drive by and see your going to the airport. Then they cancel the ride if they don’t wanna go to the airport.  The dirty little secret with Lyft is that they remove the driver from your history if you or the driver cancel. You can only rate rides taken so no bad ratings can be given to Lyft drivers when they are horrible about accepting or declining or canceling rides. Lyft drivers treat your reservation like garbage.

He had gone at least 2 blocks from my destination. He then told me to get out and just walk. I ended up having to walk in a heavy traffic area with no side walks and when I contacted the customer service they took at least two days to get back to me and send me an automated message stating that they couldn’t give me a refund because I gave him a rating of 1 star. I think that is unfair that the driver did not follow the gps, did not drop me off at the correct location, and yet still gets to keep my money. I will not continue to use their services. You just lost a loyal customer Lyft."

Also, the estimated arrival time need to be more accurate - I had rides saying arriving in 3 minutes but showing after 10-15. Make it automatically to offer an option to switch to another driver if the original one is late and not nearby. Also, scheduled rides needs more options. I had a scheduled ride that was 20 mins late and driver was not responding to my messages. Had to cancel and order a news one - I had to pay $5 cancellation fee. That is just plain wrong. Quality of drivers is inconsistent and having additional features in the app driving the behavior will weed out the bad ones and drive the customer satisfaction."

Another driver a got lost watched it on the screen so late and when there couldn’t see my son( 6’5 260 lbs ) we figured out  wrong building ( spoke very little English).

The other problem was that I had a luggage and notified the driver that I would need to be putting a large luggage in the back. She then replied back saying how her car is too small for a luggage and that I would have to cancel. I asked her to cancel because I didn’t want to pay for the $5 cancel fee. She said only I could cancel the ride. So I not only paid for the ride service but also the cancellation fee. I don’t think that’s fair on my part and that if the driver can not accommodate for the needs of the passenger, then the passenger should not pay the fine for cancelling. I don’t think I will be using Lyft in the future."

I made the mistake of losing my phone in a Lyft Vehicle the other day and I immediately told them to contact the driver and report my phone as missing. They were unable to contact him and refused to call him to confirm if my phone was in the car, telling me they can only do that if I file a police report. I was extremely disappointed and worried about my phone, but managed to track it down through an iPhone app. The driver was very nice and had no idea Lyft tried to contact him. Please be careful when using Lyft because they have terrible, terrible support. Use an alternative that’s slightly more expensive but insures your belongings can actually be retrieved."

The second driver we got was awesome but I’m still not sure how the charges on this are going to work.  Not a smooth experience. The second driver saved us and was awesome. Got us to the airport on time. I wish there was a phone number to call and talk to a customer service person."

Most drivers understand that and come exactly where I need them to other are complete morons and they say they won’t come or they will not answer they’re phone when I call to give them the correct location to come to. I think lyft needs to improve there gps because that’s a huge inconvenience for ppl who have places to be and then they charge cancellation fees

In my case, they sent 2 drivers, one at the a.m. time and one at pm. Then they charged me $10 fee for “NO SHOW” on the ride I clearly did not schedule. And since there was no confirmation sent I was not even aware that was happening. In my dispute of charges I got a lot of stock robot answers that never addressed the issue, although they did finally refund the $10. The driver was fine, and on time."

I still couldn’t cancel my lyft.  So I went to Uber app and cancelled Uber. And i had to pay a cancellation fee.  All because lyft wouldn’t give me an accurate time to pick me up

We were unable to get a car in time at that point to make it to a reservation that we had. I tried to contact Lyft and was cycled time and again to their help website, which had no selection applicable to my situation. When I finally got a hold of a number to call, I was hung up on by their system before being able to speak with anyone.

Although I really wish they would change the Instant/Express Pay feature to make it accessible for Express Drive (Lyft Rental Car) Users... don't understand why they cant allow you to use the express pay once you've covered your rental expenses for the week???

With Lyft, parking is a non-issue. The one thing I wish they’d change is that they need to add an option or filter to the requesting feature for people needing smaller cars. I have mobility issues that prevent me from being able to step up or climb into an SUV or minivan. It means I have to cancel a ride and re-request whenever I see that a big car is coming. A bother for me, and for the drivers too, I’m sure. I’d like to be tagged as someone who needs a regular-size, close-to-the-ground car every time."
435,NMoreno88,"September 14, 2018",5,Upgrades The app has been great. There are some ideas I have that I think could make Lyft even better. Why not offer a monthly subscription for those that use it everyday? The benefit for customers that do that should be half off rides and after a certain amount offer a free ride. We spend so much money on this app. The rewards are great already but I believe this will help improve customer lives financially. I also suggest that you guys add more possible destination options. You guys offered a extra stop more than Uber a year ago but now they’re offering more. You guys should match the same amount they have or offer more.

But it was going to be until Monday even if I received my money back. Even though I received my money on time. What a horrific process for American taxpayers.

Also apparently now drivers are allowed to cancel rides on you after 2 minutes and fake attempts to contact you. And fake meaning drivers pull the calling someone just to show they called but hanging up soon as they hear the first ring on their end. The drivers will literally call you for a second so that it’ll show on their call history that they called. and hang up and claim it as contact but I’ve screen shotted and have had them request the driver showing them a screenshot of how long the call was which shows proof that they do fake out calls that you have no chance of picking up. And that when you call back the drivers don’t pick up.

Also the cancellation fee is a bit much.. if we end up not need a ride any more than we're not using the service so why charge us anyway? Lastly you guys need to step up on the contact info.

We tried to call Lyft, but they don’t have a customer service number. After an hour of trying to email Lyft explaining that this is a false charge, their only response was basically “we don’t believe your excuse, we believe the driver”.

Tonight was the last straw, I was waiting late at night for  almost an hour long because a driver kept going in the opposite direction, I had to cancel the ride, and they still charged for me the cancel fee. I am beyond livid about the service this company provides."

457,Jeremy999876,"February 10, 2020",3,"Time estimates never accurate The service is great, but every time I use Lyft, the estimated wait time after placing my request is significantly longer than the expected wait time displayed prior to placing the request. Really feels like a bait and switch. I was at the airport last night and the app said there was a 3 minute wait for a car but when I placed my request, the assigned car was 20 minutes away. That is not acceptable. I world have either placed my request earlier it used Uber. There is no point to providing estimated wait times if they are not going to be within a couple minutes of the actual wait time. Very frustrating.  This is not a 1-time issue either. It happens every time I Lyft.  Will reduce my use going forward as a result."

I put in for a ride and the said it was here , but it wasn’t so I called him, he said it said Travelodge, he said ok I’m coming, but an other car poped up that they were coming , but again he went to Travelodge, an other car poped up tryed call him and he didn’t answer, so I canceled the ride and started over. Then a car came. Finally . I was charged a cancellation fee , do not feel I deserved that. Espically after a good week with lyft. Please look into this and reconsider! Thanks Flo"
459,toniobonet,"August 15, 2019",5,"Issa Decent App I have always used Lyft because personally my experiences have been way better than Uber. Lyft is the only app I’ll go with for travel and I wouldn’t replace it for Uber (not to mention the small price difference). One thing I do dislike though, is some of the glitches that the app can throw at drivers and riders. I’ve encountered situations where the drivers app wasn’t telling them where to go because It said I hadn’t been picked up yet. Another thing that I recently come across was an issue during a two stop ride, once I was picked up the app had told the driver and I (rider) that we had already been to my second stop."

Lyft has been a great transportation service for me since i use it for work everyday, but lately it has been awful, and i never get any responses to the emails that i send. I have had many issues with certain drivers and there has been no feedback from Lyft. I have paid for rides that i have not taken and drivers have gone the wrong way and run up the meter and i have been charged for tolls and longer routes. A nine min ride from work to my home turned into a 45 min drive from a nine dollar and some change charge to like 25 dollars! And i never got a reply. If this continues i will not use this service anymore and definitely spread the wrong of lack of care for customers and drivers. I would just love some feedback. Thanks."

463,thelonegrape,"September 20, 2018",1,Promos/ gift cards handled poorly The way they handle gift cards is really stupid. They have you enter them as “promos” and then on the ride you are choosing it makes it look discounted and you are getting a deal. It isn’t really discounted though it is money you have on your account. So they can trick you into thinking you will be paying less because it is isn’t explained up front.
464,Maverick78,"September 22, 2018",1,"Technology Fail! Tried Lyft for the first time for a $45 trip with my wife and daughter.

After a few minutes of trying he said “I won’t get paid, you can’t ride, get out” and kicked us out of his car and left us to find other means of transportation to our appointment. After he drove off he then started the trip without us in the car! I promptly cancelled it on my end which incurred a $5 cancellation fee!! I had to call Lyft and wait on hold for 30 minutes to get the $5 refunded, and they offered a $10 free ride credit that expires in 2 weeks. We were late to our appointment because of Lyft."
465,Awesomebill from dawsonville,"September 23, 2018",5,Unbelievable We sat on the street for 15 minutes waiting for drivers to pick us up. Multiple drivers started driving the opposite direction as people showing up after us got picked up by other ride shares. Cycled through about 5-6 drivers before we finally got picked up. Usually never have issues with lyft except for when I’m downtown by the chase stadium. Drivers should be instructed on how to navigate the downtown Phoenix area and be alerted as to when the baseball games are ending. For gods sakes there is an actual designated lyft drop off spot tht we were at that all the drivers literally couldn’t get to. If streets are shutdown THE APP SHOULD TELL THE DRIVERS.

Then, they charged me $9.70 for a ride which is not the issue but then they tried to run my card for $44 saying it was prime time, which DID NOT come up at the time of my ordering the car. If this would have prompted I definitely would not have ordered the car and canceled it. Not to mention the driver took the wrong route and saying it was my fault. "

I accepted every ride, stayed online, did my job, then arbitrarily got screwed out of my bonus because of an app glitch.  This app regularly fails at times that actually put me as a driver in danger.  The Uber app almost NEVER HAS THESE ISSUES.  Lyft likes to find excuses to pay less, or not at all.  Lyft also likes to blame the driver’s network or phone, while Uber simply continues to work just fine and pay better.  Lyft has changed for the worse over the last year I have driven for them.  I think they may have finally broken me.  I quit.  Don’t use this app- this company is ripping its driver’s off and even putting them in danger."

And drop off everyone first, even though I was the first one in the car. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE??? FIRST IN LAST OUT?????? This app has made me late for work so many times!! I have tried to leave extra early and still end up late. Hate this app. Has literally added so much stress to my life. As I sit here, in this lyft, already aware that I’m going to be 30 minutes late because of this horrendous app, I want nothing more than to erase it from my phone and stop wasting my gigs, time, money, and anxiety.

It turns out they only allow 3 credit cards to be listed at a time, and apparently you need an act of Congress to change or delete them. I also don’t like how I can’t go back and change my driver rating after I submit it. In fact, there is only a short window to give the rating and if you miss that, you can’t give a rating.

The line routes have been very poor for about a year now, but I kept giving that feedback after every ride, hoping things would improve. They haven’t.

But they keep telling me the same thing everytime I call, that they can’t do anything about it, and we’ll update me as soon as Corazon respond to their e-mail. Coz for some reason lyft can’t do outbound calls! Which is crazy especially on emergency situations! One thing is for sure lyft is making it so easy for drivers to steal from the passengers!!!

I've had so many rides where they picked up several people and drove them all over the place before dropping me off. Often after picking me and being almost half way to my destination the the app will have the driver turn all the way around and go back to where they picked me up to pick up another passenger. Sometimes they will drive right past my destination to drop off another passenger way across town then come back to drop me off. It's so crazy! 
482,Logic lunatic,"August 22, 2018",2,"Nice service mostly but despite scheduling ride the day before I was left stranded in another town I scheduled rides with Lyft a day ahead of time going both directions on a trip out of town and back. Lyft accepted the scheduling, leading me to believe that I would have a driver for each of the two rides. I had no problem getting to my destination, but there was no driver there to pick me up on the way back. In fact, the Lyft app only started trying to find a driver for me one minute before the time they were supposed to pick me up to take me home. Because lift didn’t provide the schedule driver they promised I was left stranded in this small town 25 miles from home and had to put my safety in jeopardy trying to bum a ride from other people nearby. And I had no way to get in touch with Lyft to report this."

Or I’m having to call to clarify. As a result, I’ve cancelled rides, I’ve been late arriving to my destination and at times it doesn’t seem like my app/phone and the real time activity synced; which can lead to safety issues.

Now the driver has the choice to reject or continue, but the app is just wrong. It shouldn't redirect if you are that close to the destination, especially if it's the opposite direction of the destination. It makes no sense to me.

This is normal with lift line but he proceeded to go back to the exact same place where he picked me up and picked up another rider.

I looked back on the Lyft app and seen that a dude name Kevin was about to join the ride. He asked me friend did I cancel it and no I did not cancel anything nor did I touch anything . We’re trying to get this situation together on the phone. Long story short I ended up having to take her to work myself. I’m not going to give him the money because he didn’t take her to work.... I’m not giving him a tip ... I felt like he tried to play me . I pray that Lyft is reading this because I want my money back and it’s like no way to get in touch with y’all . Y’all need a hotline not a email ... I needed to reach y’all ASAP .

I travel for work, so most of the time I have no clue what street I’m on, and quite frankly don’t have the time to QA the search results anyways.

Revised: September 24, 2018. Not tried to select more than three destinations since my previous review, however the app has changed and it is not as easy to figure out as before.

502,disatisfied customer 120,"November 4, 2018",1,"Delayed 20 min due to app error When the driver came to pick me up, the pick up point was set on a road that was blocked off for a street fair.  Because the driver could not get close enough, we were delayed 20 min trying to figure out how to adjust the pick up point.  When I finally did by accident, we then had to make another loop around the block to reach the new point as I could not accurately adjust it.  This was a really stressful and avoidable error that made for an unnecessarily complicated trip to the airport.  Please update the app to allow for the driver or passenger to override and confirm they are picked up.  Relying on the GPS that is waiting for the driver to reach a pick up point on a road that is blocked off when I’m sitting in the car just wastes my time and patience.  Will be using other ride share apps to avoid the headache in the future."

The reason I'm giving the app 3 stars is because once in a while, I (or a friend) will request a pick-up, wait for over 5 minutes, have a new driver assigned 3 times, and I'm not able to cancel the trip without being charged the cancellation fee.  If we end up getting the driver changed that many times and have to wait longer each time a new driver is assigned, there shouldn't be a cancellation fee.

512,Sw33tLemoN,"September 17, 2018",3,"Cheaper, but ETA needs improvement I enjoy the service, because it’s a cheaper alternative to other ride share services (I use about 4 times a week). However, the ETA times are consistently greatly off. Making the cheaper cost null to me. I’ve had to cancel several rides due to a pattern of unreasonable times. Example: Lyft estimates I can have a driver within 7 mins, I get an actual confirmation of around 13 mins, then the driver arrives 8 mins later than confirmed. Often, even with a shorter ETA like 8 mins, 5 mins of real time will pass and the ETA will still say 8 mins. Because this happens so often, it seems intentionally misleading and I find this to be really unfair to users. I hope improving accuracy is a priority for the developers."

I know others who have used Lyft so I figured why not give it a try.

514,jepenipinipi,"January 17, 2019",1,not what it used to be I originally got this application for rides to and from work and I used to be very convenient. however over the past month I have had issues with lateness because the times on the app are inaccurate in picking up and dropping off. It could tell me that my driver is going to pick me up in two minutes and I could take 12 minutes. The same would happen with my drives a drive though it's supposed to be 15 minutes could end up being 40 minutes with no warning. finally the last straw was when I noticed that there are transactions pending in my account for rides I did not take I have deactivated this account today after attempting to contact customer service multiple times and will not be using anymore. I hope for future clients you will consider the impact of these things.

The actual wait time is at least three times the initial estimated wait time you see when searching for rides. The cancelations and negligence on the driver side are getting more and more ridiculous too. They can drive past you and say that you didn’t show up, or call you and say that they’re on their way but speed past you. The only reason I’m giving it two stars and not one is because I often hail rides in NYC and I get that the traffic can get crazy, but seriously, no improvements?"
516,Famous One,"April 9, 2019",1,Was the best thing on my phone until a week ago So everything was great. I used shared ride probably everyday after work. This past week they added a saver plus shared ride option- basically it’s Lyft pool requiring you to walk to meet the driver- the problem is this makes my shared ride I’ve always taken now 20% more and I can’t always walk at the end of the night because of an injury.... now I feel like I’m being charged a premium to take my usual ride because I can’t walk. Moreover my route is short- walking to anywhere and I might as well just walk to my location. Add that to the driver who wouldn’t pick me up at my location that I take every day and then tried to claim he picked me up when he didn’t... yeah I’m thinking I might as well take the subway. The random price hike to loyal riders and the increase in shady drivers is not okay.

Once we were getting close to my destination the driver almost missed where he had to turn and slammed on his brakes which caused my drink to fall out his cup holder and spill on the carpet of his car. He reported me to Lyft and Lyft charged me a $50 damage fee.

The app was great with a picture of my driver and his car and a moving visual of right where he was when he was driving to me. I didn’t have to guess when he was arriving at all-I knew! He was there within five minutes too! The young man who arrived to pick me up was my first Lyft experience and it couldn’t have been better! I felt like one of my grandsons picked me up! His car was nice and it was clean. He was courteous and gave me facts about the city and ideas of places to see. He made me feel comfortable and safe. Thanks you Lyft! I’ll use Lyft from now on!

Also sometimes it allows you to make changes during the ride and sometimes not.  I also don’t like that it doesn’t even tell you if a driver has been assigned until like 10 min before you have to leave, and that’s in a major city where there are plenty of drivers.  It’s very stressful not knowing if you are going to make it to your flight/interview/audition/whatever until the last second.  "

Your App matched me with a driver who you said was 4 minutes away instead of one of the drivers that was already there waiting in line for a matched trip.  Then my driver had to wait in a 15 minute traffic line behind drivers that didn’t have anyone to pick up.  This is totally lame. And it gets worse, your people on the ground told me to go one location and another one of your people told the driver to go to a different location.  I’m there wading through traffic with my luggage to try and catch my driver before he gets sent off and away by one of your other people on the ground (after waiting 20 minutes for him to get there).

I tried twice - scheduling at 12:00 - and each time it said my ride would arrive right away - like at 10:37 - and I had to cancel because that was too early. I finally called one of the drivers and told them what time I wanted to be picked up and that worked. The app still dinged me $5 for the cancellations. My gripe is with the app, not the service.

They do not have a good gps system, the app does not clearly show drivers where to pickup passengers and drop them off, even when they write in the address or pin the location. Designated lyft areas in areas like airports are not made clear by the app or drivers. Drivers are then not understanding of these issues and the impact they have on the riders. Customer service is unresponsive or will transfer you several times forcing you to retell your issue over and over again. Customers are not listened to on legitimate issues and bad drivers keep driving people."

530,Tzigane2013,"October 29, 2017",4,"Not as intuitive as Uber I’m knocking a star off because it’s not as intuitive as the Uber app. I try to use Lyft instead of Uber when possible, but I don’t understand why the app doesn’t guess my location and destination as well as Uber. For example: I was looking at Dick’s Sporting Goods in Google Maps, leaving from the Kimpton Hotel. In Google Maps, I clicked to open the Lyft app. To specify my pickup point, I had to type in the entire hotel name and let it search. Then it asked me for my destination. Well duh, where do you think I’m trying to go? In the Uber app, as soon as I typed the letter K, it would guess I was at the Kimpton, and would already be quite aware that I’m trying to go to Dick’s."

It seems like you can still do so to some degree for dropoff, but if you want to schedule a ride later and don’t know the EXACT address you’re out of luck. Say you’re at the theatre but want to get picked up a bit further away from the entrance so you can avoid congestion, or if you want to select a part of the street that a driver could easily pull over at, or if you’re inside a specific part of a public park, or if your “you are here” GPS is unreliable. Now you too can enjoy the frustration of trying to figure out if random areas even have map addresses! Never thought I’d be going back to Uber, but this is a stupendously unhelpful update. If this isn’t fixed by the next update, I’m out. Give me back my drag-n’-drop map pins, please."
532,Deezyf.,"May 1, 2018",3,Not dissatisfied but not entirely happy Overall I am good with the service Lyft provides but there are a few drawbacks at least that I've encountered. My drivers normally seem to come to sooner than expected or much later. It could be the drivers but for much as I encounter this I assume the GPS tracking. Just today it picked up my location as on the freeway when I was infact in my home about half a mile from there. My app is currently up to date as well as my OS. For the most part I encounter awesome drivers and use the line frequently so I am pleased with the fact that y'all offer cheap rates and still come to my door unlike your competitor so not all the way bad. Maybe look into for tracking. Btw I'm using an iPhone SE if that helps.

There have been some glitches, with drivers that never showed up, or said we were “no shows”, or drivers that cancelled the trip before we could find where they were waiting.  I had one instance where someone “hijacked” our ride, until the driver realized the wrong person had gotten in.  The drivers ask if you are “name”, rather than asking you your name.  This would cut down on “hijackings”.  We have also had drivers who let us off at the wrong location."

Today I had a driver whose app would not let him complete my pick up, and he was forced to cancel a full share pool because your app does not provide live and real time support for drivers. He attempted driving near the spot multiple times to try and complete my pick up. The second driver could not navigate properly to pick me up and drove the complete opposite direction of myself and the pick up scheduled before me.

Then, the $4.99 ride pass I “bought” last night actually never went through. Then, the apps map was really inaccurate and my driver had a hard time finding me and my drop off spot. Then when I arrived, it sent me another notification saying ANOTHER ride was on its way, one I did not schedule. I quickly cancelled— however how is this the normal experience for an app that’s supposed to function? This was not user error, the app is dysfunctional."
536,Poodie1122,"June 3, 2019",2,Protected There have been a lot of bad things going on with rideshare services. I want to know how are you all going to make your customers feel safe. How is it that someone who don’t work for you all can get someone’s information and pretend like they are the driver and pick them up. Either your software is easy to hack into or you all just don’t care. You all are in the news to frequent when it comes to the passengers safety. Sex trafficking is a really big deal in today’s age and rideshare services are a easy way for someone to kidnap you into it. I have been a customer since you all came to Atlanta and it’s very frightening to see that people are scared to ride the service because of safety issues. Something has to be done as soon as possible. Safety is a big issue.

From driving aggressively, unfriendly , and on quite a few occasions the driver never showed up and just continued to drive around. Another thing that has happened on multiple occasions was that the driver said they were at my location when they very clearly weren’t then when I tried to call/text the driver I would get no response. Then when I would cancel I would end up being charged a fee and then having to contact Lyft to correct it. It gets old after awhile. I feel like Lyft is basically hiring anyone, I use to choose Lyft because I felt like they had higher standards but now I’m not so sure."

I’ve been a lyft rider for a few good years and love what they represent in comparison with the competition. With taxi apps it’s been the reality that all my problems had to do with tech issues. Considering how many drivers work, shifting slightly the ratio between driver and testers and techies could change a lot. And I expect a company they tried to be a real different than Uber  to wait before pushing more algos that just try to inhumanly/blindly Maximize profits. Today I’ve been waiting for 15 minutes for a ride, and had to cancel the ride and order Juno after seeing the driver was not moving for 4-5 minutes and didn’t respond to calls and keep getting confusing messages from the app by texts to my phone about changes etc."

Today I was alerted that my driver was hard of hearing before he showed up. I appreciated getting that cue because knowing that made the drive better. If customers could put something pertinent like that and it would come up as an alert to the driver before the driver arrived (e.g. customer is partially blind.

We asked if it was cleaned to her satisfaction so we wouldn’t be charged, she said yes it was and left.

Then get another message saying Eric was coming, when he got there I told him my story and he said they switch driver. That went well, but after the ride I got a message that I was being charged $5 for making the driver wait ten minutes. Not happy,  "

560,Charlie Stronghorn,"October 25, 2017",1,"Company allows drivers to extort customers I use Lyft as my primary form of transportation and literally spend hundreds of dollars a month on it. Last weekend we briefly left a phone in a car on accident. The driver made us pay him $50 to get the phone back. Yeah- you read that right. He extorted us to pay him $50 to get our phone back. I even recorded the entire situation. This by itself isn’t evidence of a bad company, but when we called Lyft we were certain that they would do something to make amends. Nope. They didn’t even ask which driver did it. They hid behind their 1 billion page end user agreement, and said it wasn’t their responsibility. They even refused to refund the ride, and took a defensive tone practically hanging up on me. In the end, they gave us a $15 credit in a $30 ride with a $50 extortion fee. Never using them again."
561,Tavomunk,"November 12, 2017",1,"Pricing and prime time Before you would get a notification that it was prime time and it would also reflect it on your receipt, but as of late that was changed. If you put in your pick up and drop off location the prime time notification will not pop up in fact it will be hidden behind the price and it will not reflect in the receipt either. I had to go through hurdles just to get through customer support and even then the whole process felt horrible, and was treated as if I wasn’t a long time loyal customer. I’ll give them props where it’s due, they did refund me the prime time charge but it took me a long time to find the right method to request for a review. The reply was also fairly fast had to wait less than 8 hours so it’s not that bad either, but overall horrible experience with Lyft’s new system."
562,Blind iuser,"July 18, 2018",3,"New changes to the way Lyft app works You made some changes to the app that make it harder to use with voiceover. It’s harder to find my next line when I want to add a stop to my trip or to verify that you have the right pick up address. As a matter fact, it looks a lot like the Uber app now.  This is one of the reasons aside from the higher cost that I don’t use Uber anymore. They are not as aware of how we use their app."
563,mountain grade,"July 30, 2018",4,"Navigation I’m a first time user. Overall I’m impressed. My critique is the address inaccuracy for their gps system. It poorly reflects on the physical location. I lost my first ride because the driver was directed to a locked emergency gate at airport facility. Once that was sorted out, the gps dumped us in the middle of a Blvd after we blew past my hotel with a clearly labeled address in plain sight. However the trip to my destination was seamless. Quick route changes based on traffic. It warned the driver of a car on the shoulder before we could even see it. Very efficient in that manner. "
564,GentleGim,"August 8, 2018",5,Great service but often goes to wrong place !! I was going to write this but it happens now more often than it doesn’t. I will cut and paste an address into the app and somehow the driver is given a different address. Worse. I took a very expensive Lyft to catch a ferry because it would get me there in time for a 2 hour earlier ferry than the cheap train would   The Andress was correct but somehow the App took us to the wrong side of the river. I was forty feet from my ferry but could get o.  By the time I got to the actual address it was pulling out and I had to wait the full to hours.  Lyft refused to take ANY responsibility.
565,meles72,"September 20, 2018",3,"Terrible routes, confusing pickup In general the Lyft drivers are quite nice and drive safely. But many do not know the city, and the GPS system used by Lyft is terrible. It frequently gives indirect and longer routes. An extreme example was a few months ago in Philadelphia, when our driver got on the highway to go from 2nd and Walnut to 16th and Walnut—a straight shot and 10 minute drive that we had taken on the way there that took 40 minutes of circuitous driving and sitting in traffic on the way back because the driver insisted that the GPS said he should take the highway. But less miserable examples happen all the time. Though taxis are hard to get, those drivers know the city and always take the quickest route."
566,Salgud,"September 26, 2018",5,"Great for a ride for myself, but can’t pay for a ride for someone else! Lyft really needs to add the ability to arrange a ride for someone else. I would like to send a Lyft to pay for my daughter-in-law’s transportation to school in the morning, since her car is in the shop, but now I have to drive all the way across Denver to take her there myself! Lyft is missing a lot of business by not having this ability. They also need to have some way to get in contact with customer service rather than a bunch of very specific menus that have nothing to do with my issue! Terrible customer service!"

I had a minor glitch issue with my app during a ride i was activity taking and I addressed my issues after my ride, lyft quickly responded and took consideration into my request and fixed my issue immediately. I highly recommend this app to anyone that needs loyal and safe transportation to their daily destinations."

EVER, and the app asks for my address and I give it exactly... well app sends the driver to the school playground area next to the apartment complex in which I live. So I had to haul all my work bags out to the front of my complex which was not a small task then the directions it gave her to drop me off at work were totally wrong and I had to give her directions almost the entire way. The application gave her 97% wrong info from pick-uo to drop off. So it was a horrible experience when I was already totally stressed out using something that I’m not familiar with. "

She watched the first driver on the map not move for 15 mins so we had to order another one which happened to be the same driver that wasn’t moving. This happened twice. She didn’t want this driver and he was the one that kept trying to come. So I sent it from my account and this time they just did not show. The driver called and I tried to explain to him where we were and he kept telling me that we weren’t outside and would not come to where we were. I am NOT happy about the situation because my daughter ended up being 45mins late for work. So one star for the rides that never showed and not being able to speak to a live person about the situation.

I see one can just have 3 stops in a route. This really is the one complaint I have about this app. Every other aspect of it is beautiful and wonderful. Adding more than 3 stops is the most demanding request I get from passengers. To compensate till there’s possibly a change, I just take them wherever they need or want to go with their guidance since I’m paid by distance and time anyway. But having the ability to add up to 5 stops would be appreciated to resolve confusion and add to the user experience."

Had a bad experience today with a ride, and based off of my comments and review, I got contacted by the Lyft customer service (within 1 hour after my ride) and they apologized/gave away more free rides to me and also followed up with the situation.

My immediate reaction was that my card got hacked. I contacted Lyft asap and told me they have the account who stole my card number on hold. Number one, why won’t you delete an account that stole another individuals card information? And number two, where is my refund? They told me to call my bank (in which, I did so) and they told me that they couldn’t do anything because Lyft, the company themselves, had power over the payments in my bank account. I emailed and asked for a refund. I still haven’t gotten anything. Lyft cannot he trusted. Uber is better. I never and will continue to never use Lyft in my life, be careful where you take your card kids. (Also, Lyft, I’ll still be waiting for my refund. 😘❤️)"
573,SmallBlondeOne,"October 12, 2018",2,"Drivers abusing “I’m here” Ever since lyft implemented the passenger penalty for driver wait time, I have noticed that several drivers have abused the “I’m here” button and stated that they had arrived when they had not, only to show up minutes later. I have to pay a fee for the driver waiting even though I was actually the one waiting. Lyft should have thought through this function before implementing. Drivers should be reviewed or penalized for continuing to drive (per GPS data) after they click “I’m here”. Passengers should also have the opportunity to click something to report the driver if they say “I’m here” and the passenger is at the meeting point and the driver is not there."

Sleep deprived, and wearing hospital pajamas because blood had gotten all over my clothing, having a Lyft ride home was a welcome sight this morning.  The $17 fare was reasonable and they were there in 11 mins. The first driver was assigned and then it was switched to another one that was closer. They notified me to look for his glowing sticker.  It was almost like having a friend come pick me up, but I didn’t have to wake up anyone I knew, at such an early hour 6:30am. Driver was pleasant, his music was soothing. I thank you!

575,Benjamin_L_R,"November 12, 2018",1,"Scheduled rides don’t show up, rides get address wrong, overpriced Multiple times, rides to the airport that have been scheduled the day before never actually get fulfilled. It says a driver is being requested for 15 minutes but never finds a driver. Even though we live in a major city and requesting a ride normally at any time of the day gets a driver within a few minutes. Additionally, most of the time, the app sends drivers towards the correct address but directs them into dead ends nearby in the neighborhood instead of down the correct streets. Last, rides in my city are ridiculously overpriced. When my knee was injured, and I had to request rides often, it was routine to get charged more than $15 per mile, even outside of rush hour. Uber was almost always cheaper, more reliable, and more likely to have drivers not get lost"

I like how there are deals for new users and throughout your time of using the app.  While I did have a no show fee waved recently in Las Vegas, I had to pay the fee for the next ride I missed which was problematic because my guest and I couldn’t get to the pickup location that was on the complete other side of the hotel in time.  In general though, drivers have been friendly and I like the deals that I have received, even received a discount recently due to the app saying my ride didn’t complete in the time that was planned."

578,AllyB127,"November 18, 2019",2,"OK If you don’t NEED to be somewhere I don’t think Lyft has almost ever been right about their arrival times (not just with shared rides). Seems like they make it look like you’ll get somewhere quicker than Uber when in actuality they’ll get you there in the same time if not later. Customer service is BAD so just cross your fingers that you won’t have any issues. I’ve continued to use Lyft because they’re said to be safer and more caring than Uber, however, over the years, any time I’ve had an issue, they end up blaming me in some way or another. After 2 consecutive poor rides that have gone ignored by customer service, I will be wary to use again. Use Uber unless you don’t care when you get somewhere or if you want a pleasant customer service experience."
579,Aarp status,"August 26, 2019",4,AARP status This was our first time using this apt. I didn’t realize there were two pick up areas at McCarran airport. We called our first driver right away to ask her to pick us up at terminal 1 area rather then terminal 3. She said we had to edit the information and was not very helpful or understanding. We found a nice young lady nearby to help us. She tried but it showed that we could only edit our drop off point. Our only option was to cancel because there was no way we could make it to terminal 3 on time. So we had to pay the fee. Then the nice young lady helped us order a new ride. Therefore the 4 star rating because of this experience.
580,caitlynphillips,"November 1, 2017",5,"Do not use the pool option These ride share apps are convenient, until you’re in a hurry and the driver keeps picking people up and dropping them off before you. Whatever algorithm or whatever is being used is flawed. I live in Washington, D.C. and traffic here can be pretty bad. To go 3 Miles has taken over an hour in a pool. If you are in a hurry do not even consider this feature as an option. Overall, my experience with lyft has been positive, but the prices keep creeping up and it seems more and more often the service is ‘surging’. Still cheaper than uber 90% of the time."
581,LyncAdmin,"September 30, 2018",1,2 out of 6 success rate - Drivers in San Fran area abandon you I’m VERY disappointed in Lyft this trip. I’ve had to reach out to their near impossible support 3 different times. 2 times the drivers left us after 30 seconds of not attempting to find us and said we were a “no show” which then flags negatively on my account and charges $5. Their response when finally getting support “oh we are sorry. We will not pair you with that driver again”. Seriously!!? How does that even remotely help with customer service in a city I don’t live in and I’m sure I’d never be paired with them again anyway. I got abandoned 2 times that way in the not so nice area and had to walk about 2 miles in heels. Ridiculous! They then gave me a $10 credit which is a little laughable because it has an expiration of less than a month...seriously?
582,Murf4104,"October 8, 2018",5,Multiple ride share pickups at the airport... I don’t blame the driver or the APP for the decisions lyft makes. At times the multiple pickups on ride share are not close or don’t make sense.  The driver I recently had was instructed to go around the airport again to pickup another rider... that added 40 minutes to the ride which is absurd.

Second driver just canceled and wouldn’t answer the phone so I could tell him where the apartment is, this is ridiculous and I was late for work because of this type of inefficiency, all these drivers need to answer their phones, set up their voicemails and respond to text messages, especially when they are picking up someone who lives in a condo/apartment, this is very infuriating"

Ride customer service and got absolutely nowhere between emailing customer support and numerous calls requiring 4.23 hours of my work time to get my phone back. Customer service also couldn’t answer my questions nor update my account correctly and Almost impossible to reach. Words experience ever!! Needless to say the DRIVER handled it himself and brought my phone to me as LYFT customer service helped 0.

The Lyft drivers are amazing and always they go above beyond service. I personally drive Lyft as a college student and it’s a experiment I did my self.

589,Joshua_451,"August 2, 2019",4,Great convenience but This app is great for getting quick rides and the drivers are usually nice and talkative. However it’s best in the afternoon and night. Early morning not so much. I’ve used the scheduling for the early mornings for work and always request a ride the day before. And every time by the day and time that I need the ride the driver bails and I’m left having to find another last minute driver. This has happened on several occasions and I’ve been late to work because of it too many times. In other words it’s best to be used at 7am - around 10pm then rides are iffy or impossible especially if you need to get somewhere quickly.

I put in multiple address thinking hey maybe they don’t come to this part of NY but every address I put in it said Lyft not available here mind you I put address all over NY it made no difference. Delete the app off my phone put it back on my phone and it still says the same thing to this day! I used to like Lyft when uber was b n a pain or too expensive. I was in Miami I tried using Lyft my driver said they had picked me up and never picked me up I tried calling but no answer. And they just drove off saying they were in route to my destination. Canceled the ride and got charged a fee! I order another one and it did the same thing. Idk what’s going on with Lyft but this is unacceptable as a company!!!
591,zimrah,"March 24, 2019",5,Please update this app again. There should be a way to contact the driver on the completed trip screen if they never actually picked you up so you can find another driver instead of downloading a competitor’s app on the street at 3 a.m. and having customer service tell you the next morning that you have to accept the charge for the ride you never took in order for them to process a refund.

Then one day out of nowhere, with no warning, Lyft cancelled my account and sent me a message saying a driver said I took something from their car. That’s it. Nothing else. I emailed them, and they said they would be investigating the matter and this was their process. I was not only wrongfully accused of stealing by a Lyft Driver, and the company I trusted for years; but they never got back to me about such investigation, and never apologized for anything.

It went from saying we would arrive back at 1145 to arriving home shortly before 1 am. I didn’t see where we could rate the driver that stranded us. (I feel this should be an option because he was giving us the run around telling us all kinds of excuses). It was disappointing because it was a first time using this service. On a positive note the ride there and the ride back was great."

599,jstoves12,"June 10, 2019",1,Bad experience I called lyft support and described my problem as that I ordered a LyftXL and someone named Ayid came and picked my group of 5 up in a small Cadillac sedan when on his profile it said he would arrive in a large Toyota Highlander. When I called lyft support they had to transfer me 3 seperate times until they said they could file a report. Then I explained how unsafe and unreliable this was and how it wasted my time and made me and my group 30 minutes to our event and I asked Kimberly if I could get a credit or some kind of compensation and Kimberly assured me that I would be adequately compensated. So I checked my email AND I WAS ONLY CREDITED FIVE DOLLARS!?!? So in summary someone is either hacking into and using someone else Lyft account or an approved lyft driver is using an unregistered vehicle which caused me to be 30 minutes late to my event.  But THANK GOD I was credited $5.
600,CarlyeAnn,"January 30, 2018",4,Give the drivers more info up front! This morning was sketchy?!  Why?  Because the app doesn’t give the drivers the drop off location when they see the ride request.  This is super inefficient and makes for awkward rides when the driver doesn’t want to go from Piedmont to Pleasant Hill or vice versa.  Today’s driver just about asked me to get out - about a mile from my pickup location - because the painter was going to meet him at 8:30 blah blah blah.  Had he known where I was going when the request came through I would NOT have been put in an uncomfortable and potentially unsafe position.  Update the app.  Add this feature.  Set yourself apart from the other guy!

Nothing comes out of talking to their support team, it seems to be 100% automated and they have no idea what you’re saying.  Lyft has also taken $10 from my account on random occasions saying it is a hold fee, this has happened 5+ times and has sent me into overdraft once when I had very little in my account, resulting in overdraft fees. There’s no way to tell when they will take the $10 or when it will be back into my account, and when I spoke to customer service they couldn’t even tell me why they kept taking $10.

One hour later my son is still waiting in the cold no ride and problem not resolved."
606,lyft rips you off,"February 23, 2019",1,"Ridiculous how they rip you off I typically use Uber, but my BF and I were in Tahoe and needed a ride and Lyft was showing $12 for the trip initially (which is very fair) so I booked it, received a confirmation text, and was watching our driver make his way to us. When he was 4 minutes away, apparently the app on his end shut down and on my end went blank as well and suddenly we didn’t have a ride (when it was already confirmed and showed him almost arriving to us). We went to rebook and the price for the same exact trip TRIPLED in price. This is not ok and I will not support these business tactics. The driver himself was wonderful and I gave him a big tip- I just hope he gets all of it and am very upset with what Lyft pulled on us tonight. I don’t love Uber’s surge pricing, but at least they’re more straightforward about it. Shame on you, Lyft."

He was mindful of my needs and assisted me getting off the car and assisted me with getting my things off the car and waited 15-20 minutes at the pharmacy for my scripts to be filled. Took me to my dr appointment and picked me back up then took me to the pharmacy and brought me home. We had good conversation and he even asked me what kind of my music I liked and played good music and the music was in a nice volume as well. I would use his LYFT services again and again. He is just an awesome person."
609,Eye of the tyger,"January 25, 2020",1,"Not suited for travel to and from work apparently I used this app while my my truck was having issues. It’s not a reliable way to get a ride to and from work. I’ve had times where it finds a driver, schedules this 10 minute drive an hour out, and after half an hour of waiting says “finding a different driver” or something like that. Alternatively, I’ve had where my ride and my driver were there in a timely fashion. To summarize my experience, if you have a place to be at a certain time, or if you need a to finalize a plan for a ride by a specific time, this ride will not let you do that."
610,devcxyz,"December 15, 2017",5,"App went downhill The app seems to have gone downhill! I’m late to work twice this month! It’s ridiculous to match with a driver who took 15 min to come. I usually try to give additional 30 min because I take lyft line. Normal commute is 30 min so I already gave extra allowances, requesting rides usually 1 hour before I start work. Am I supposed to start requesting 1.5hour ahead of time then? I mean one time we were 3 exits away already and we had to turn around to pick up a rider... that’s just getting ridiculous. I used to prefer lyft compared to uber... I’m switching my daily commute to uber"
611,Chris P from the B,"May 8, 2018",5,"Lyft in my life I love you guys to death, I use uber as well and since I’m on a budget I always go with the cheaper option and 8/10 you guys beat the competition by $2 or more and on the few occasions your competition was cheaper the drivers were not on the same level as yours. I’ve never had a miscommunication or any kind of negative experience with any kind of your drivers and I’ve built personal and professional relationships with most of your employees . If I could at the moment afford to pay for Lyfts quality every time I would. "
612,Samanthialeann,"October 8, 2018",5,Wonderful Customer Service I absolutely LOVE Lyft! I ride almost everyday sometimes twice a day and any and all issues or concerns that I have had were dealt with ASAP and to my advantage!! I have NO complaints at all. Very dependable and will get you to your destination very quickly. If by the chance you have a bad experience (which is going to happen) they are quick to fix the problem. Will continue to use as daily transportation! I Love the ease of the online help support I always get emailed within 30 mins after I reach out to support. Thanks for being such an awesome company!
613,GAMillerick,"November 20, 2018",1,"Constantly getting incompetent drivers I'm not exaggerating when I say that every single time I request a Lyft, I have to cancel (and get charged for) at least 2 before I am successful. Either the driver pulls up on the wrong side of the road and refuses to come to me (I live in a city and it's not safe to just walk through the middle of the road hence WHY I AM CALLING A LYFT IN THE FIRST PLACE) or they are going in the wrong direction for way too long with no sign of coming toward me. I'm so sick of Lyft charging me and wasting my time and money because their drivers can't figure it out. Switching back to Uber immediately. Also annoying when I get into the Lyft and the driver asks me for directions....? There is a MAP. And where do my cancellation fee ""credits"" go? I've never been able to use a credit before? This app is a load of BS and I'm over it."
614,Good Ol' Pops,"January 5, 2019",5,"Easy to use I normally use Uber but this time the rate was cheaper with LYFT so I used it. I was able to quickly download and set up an account and found the app easy to use and very accurate. The only thing I didn't notice was a pickup notes feature to let the driver know, for example, where you are in a shopping plaza etc. I'm not taking any stars away though because it very well could have been there or the option to leave one could ha e been in a menu but it was starting to rain and I was in a hurry to get a ride so I didn't really look that well."

I’m getting really frustrated with this situation. This has just started happening in the past few months. "

Plus the wait time was 3 minutes and ended up 15 minutes and you first sent me to 75 East 93rd street and then the driver was in 84 th between park and Lexington!! Think Via has a better system but after 6 years trying Lyft as I own the stock and the wait time for Via has gotten very long and their prices have gone up a lot and they are now charging every one the congestion fee!! I hope this works or I am going back to Taxis!!!
617,NiceNotStupid,"February 12, 2020",1,Some of your drivers are Horrible and should never ever be employed I don’t know what kind of messed up and incredibly misguided hiring process you guys have but some of these drivers are complete psychopath and should never ever be hired to work with the public like this. I have been disrespected by several drivers. I even just had a driver say they were outside my place when I have been standing outside for 10 minutes. Then I called him five times and they didn't answer. I'm texting them over and over saying how I need it desperately get to work then finally they drive next to me with only 30 minutes on the clock and say I'm going to cancel you you're too high maintenance. What the heck. That's so unprofessional and disgusting. That woman needs to be fired and never hired in customer service again!!!
618,lovelylinette,"October 13, 2019",4,"Lyft pick ups Areas that are bus stops and where the curb is painted red, drivers won’t stop there because they could get a ticket. I was stand beyond the bus stops so it is legal to stop there but the drivers don’t always see me and turn to avoid the bus stop, but that causes me to have to run back, cross the street, lose time and creates extra drive on my route. If lyft took note of red painted curbs/bus stops where it is illegal to stop in SF and move the pick up locations to where drivers can legally stop, it would be more efficient and less frustrating for both driver and passengers. It happens frequently and causes tension between drivers and passengers."
619,babBn6be99,"October 12, 2019",1,"Driver did not show. It is a recurring problem. In NYC At 65 2nd Ave at a prominent restaurant at 9 pm. A driver was located 4 minutes away and then in20 seconds I got a message that the driver was there. I looked for his car up and down, across the street, around the corner. No car. No Akmal! No license plate of type/color of car. I was warned that he would wait only 4 minutes or I’d be charged $5. I called him. No answer. I txted him and told him the name of the restaurant. No response. I kept calling but no answer. 5 minutes later another message from a different drive. He showed up 2 minutes later. Will Lyft charge a $5 no show fee? It has happened twice before. Contesting this is not worth the hassle. I don’t have the time to prevent being ripped off. But I won’t use Lyft again. I think it’s a scam. Someone should investigate this."
620,LadySabe,"September 14, 2017",5,Unfair It's truly unfair to the rider that you cannot know your rating and are penalized for things you are unaware of and out of control. I am always polite to drivers and came to find out I had a low rating after riding only 6 months with lyft. The driver I had last night was kind enough to share this with me because he couldn't understand why that would happen. I suggest a revamp of your system and a way for riders to defend themselves against unfair ratings especially if the treatment involves harsh rides which I wasn't understanding why it was occurring and long wait times.
621,Emmer Dngrn,"September 25, 2017",1,Please never use lyft Please never use lyft unless you’re okay with having your belongings stolen from you. I’ve always preferred lyft to Uber. From now on I will be going Uber. My lyft driver cancelled on me while my items were in his vehicle. It’s been days and the company support is no help with resolving the issue.  Lost and found can only send the driver emails in hopes that he responds. They cannot directly call him and speak about anything. I cannot get one representative on the phone to handle my issue in a professional way. I’m at lose of between $40 to $50 and the company tells me there’s no policy to compensate my loss. How can you have drivers and even customer service representatives that cannot help you and cannot be trusted.? I will not give any more money to these horrible people. Not even the supervisor has been help.

To me the drivers are nicer and I’ve never heard anything crazy happen to riders like uber. But still there should be some extra safety help. I think that you guys should add an discreet emergency button like if your lift driver is taking you the wrong way or being suspicious. And I recommend when you click it asks you whats going like is your driving being rude,suspicious,etc. or if your driver is going the wrong way and not following your directions but all in all great app just a suggestion though."

I had tried to set up a ride with UBER  and the driver was going to take 15 min and then canceled on me right after I waited 14 min! Getting another Uber was going to be another 15-20 min wait so I tried LYFT and WOW!! WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!!! My LYFT driver came in 4 min and he was AWESOME!!! He was SUPER friendly and had an immaculately CLEAN car and he also LISTENED to me about taking a shortcut/backroad to get me home quickly in rush hour traffic!! His name was PHILIP and it was at 5:30pm on busy SUNNYSIDE RD in HappyValley-THANK UOU PHILIP FOR THE GREAT RIDE!! I will NEVER use UBER again!!

Had an issue once when a drive came to pick me with a unregistered vehicle, he also drove without his seat belt the entire trip. I noticed when he was about to drop me off, he turned on the lights. I asked if he had his belt off the entire trip and he replied saying it was uncomfortable for him because he was not familiar with the vehicle being a rental. I went out to get his license number and it did not match the app, now this part was on me but when he called out for me I felt no worries but now I verify every ride on all platforms. I sent in a message all I got back was apologies and we will ensure it never happens again, no feedbacks what so ever."

I stood in the street to flag him down and watched his car with the 8BJE009 license plate go around me and drive off without even trying to pick me up. Lyft could do better keep people like Ershad from doing things like this to their users. At least make sure both parties are at the pick-up location or something..."

Also I’ve graded the ride repeatedly to not pick me up on the street off the highway bc it’s unsafe and dark, to which they constantly send my car to  pick me up there, smh. Again Frustrating!!! I went to Lyft from Uber bc it had better share-ride service. Now I’m contemplating going back to Uber. Shape up Lyft or you’re getting shipped out."

Most of your drivers are polite and keep their cars very clean. If and when there is an issue, I really appreciate that I can reach a Lyft representative within a very short amount of time and actually speak/chat about what’s going on (as opposed to sending emails and waiting hours and/or days for a response).

640,Cyharim,"February 11, 2019",2,"Unreliable scheduled rides The more I use the scheduled ride feature the more it becomes unreliable. I’ve had so many late rides that I even started putting that into consideration when scheduling a ride by putting scheduling 10 min earlier, so it was scheduled for 25-35. It gives me a driver that will arrive at 45, who is completing a ride near by then after the driver completes ride, I get cancelled. Then it takes forever to take a new one and finally someone else who is completing a ride nearby takes it and arrives at 49. Unlike Uber it’s not a guaranteed ride and you don’t even get compensated for a driver being late. Lyft may be cheaper but because it is so unreliable at this point for me that I might stop using it.

Then, check, and it shows that I am not logged in, so I log in and it takes me back to the screen that has no option to delete and have to click Help again, which takes me back to the screen with the nonexistent button and shows I’m no longer logged in.

The service and the app are easy to use in cities everywhere, the prices beat the other guys, and for the most part drivers are top-notch. My only complaint with the app itself is that I initially had a business card and a personal card in the app, but kept accidentally putting rides on the wrong cards; it’s a user error but I’d like the app to make it easier to separate the two.

Sometimes emergencies happen or dangerous situations and not everyone has the money for a ride at the time and lyft allows you to pay later. Of course you can not do this more than once you must pay for the last ride before having another one but I love this concept."

Strongly suggest you make it easier to schedule a time for pickup instead of present screen that doesn’t allow one to determine pickup time. Or at least give space for alternate time.

But then, after ten minutes’ patient waiting, I realized the app had not contacted anyone. It was merely “requesting”, even though the interface looked exactly like a driver was on his way, except that it wasn’t really “requesting”. It was simply frozen.

Uber only gives you 2 minutes to get in before they tack on extra charges for your ride. I use Lyft for when I get groceries. It takes more than 2 minutes sometimes to load a car...

Customer service did not provide any sufficient evidence towards a $50 charge aside from a photo of a napkin and a paper plate. A $50 charge is typical for someone throwing up on the outside of car. I’m not able to understand how those two examples are even close to similar, and yet we were charged $50. Customer service should be in service of the customer, due to this terrible interaction I have deleted this app and have advised 17 others to delete this app as well. This issue could have been resolved with appropriate customer service to remedy this situation. Instead it resulted in loosing 18 loyal customers and I’ll continue advising others to not use this service."

She says Lyft pays her more and costs the customer more than Uber does. Demand for Uber is higher. I prefer Lyft because of the unpleasant stories about Uber’s corporate culture. If Lyft treats its drivers better, I’m willing to pay. Also, the Uber app interface is confusing if you want to schedule ahead, as I did. I had to pay Uber $5.00 for a late cancellation (3minutes) when I hesitated on the app. I won’t go back to Uber for that kind of treatment. I had no trouble doing the same thing on Lyft."

I went outside with my bags about 10 minutes early and no one was there and the app said “looking for drivers”. When one was found it said they would arrive in half an hour. Then they disappeared and the app said “looking for drivers” again. A new driver came on -half an hour away. Then that driver called and said they were an hour away. You cannot rely on Lyft for a scheduled pickup. I’ve found no way to contact Lyft. You can only contact and leave feedback for your driver. And it’s not this 3rd driver’s fault.

Things are harder to find now and this has inconvenienced me as well as many other visually impaired individuals who will probably resort to using Uber being that this app has lost much of its familiar functionality.

It keeps sending the drivers to one specific area that is a dentist and NOT my address. I’ve never used that address, never been to that dentist.

I was unaware that The Lyft GPS had not picked up the correct pickup address so the driver went to Sargent Drive instead. Neither of us knew how to correct the information so I was forced to cancel and pay $5. I easily got another driver but feel I should not be required to pay the cancellation fee.
666,Caibuck in Hanford,"November 9, 2019",5,"My opinion of Lyft We have utilized Lyft more than the “other”, due to price and availability.  Our usage is primarily when we visit daughter in Chicago, and getting to and from airport in our hometown. Rides back and forth definitely beat parking fees and driving home late at night after travel. Chicago is a matter of rental car, and parking availability. We always compare prices and driver availability, and Lyft is almost always the winner. Will continue to compare. We feel ‘better’ about using Lyft versus the uncertainty of cab costs and nowadays driver availability is almost as good as a cab."

There is no way to include directions for the driver in the app. Also, my flight was going to be delayed, but I could find no way in the app to contact the driver and alert her to the change in plans. It would be helpful if these features were added/updated. My driver,Monalisa, was lovely and very apologetic for things which were not her fault. This rating reflects my frustration with the app. I would give Monalisa 5 stars."

Some of the good drivers are kind enough to call ya to give us heads up about the complete miscalculation of arrival time. This seems to be happening every single morning around that time. My son needs to be at school by 8.30 am, and Lyft seems to be unable to provide reliable transportation at that time. We are probably going to try Uber to see if they have this area covered better in the mornings."

Our driver was there but didn’t see us running and waving so we missed it. He didn’t even try to call us. So we tried again - the app showed another destination we were supposed to walk to so we gave up and started walking. Driver called me and I explained the app problem but we were already frustrated and didn’t want to back track again. So another $5 charge. So - not using Lyft in the French Quarter again."

It is a bit easier for Google to provide this info since all factors can be controlled whereas you should know how long the wait is to get a ride. But you can base it on historical data for the pickup spot and availability of cars nearby. Having to wait till I need a ride and find out when I’d reach the destination is a pain and wastes quite a bit of time. Hope you consider it and get a leg up over Uber and other competitors.

I would hope that this is an isolated incident and not what the future hold for Lyft. I hope that I never experience this again. I can not fathom why it would take a driver who is only 2 minutes away, to never show after an hour. To say I am disappointed does not begin to describe my feelings. What is even worse I could not readily locate a phone number for Lyft  for assistance. Is there anyone monitoring these drivers and noticing when there are lengthy delays to speak with the driver, or send another driver and update the customer?"

However, in light of all these kidnappings and harassment, especially with the risk companies like lyft take hiring strangers, there should be a way to keep people safe. I think the company should implement a safety button on the app for the rider. I mean, lyft should do way more extensive background checks in drivers and require a lot more than just a car, a license and the app. But I think giving the app and emergency button, I also have a plan for this myself, would highly improve the over feeling of safety for passengers!"

Very sweet, fun and energetic. We had 4 people and 7 bags in a sedan and he said “no worries, we will make it work”. And we did. We even stopped thru in and out burger on the way to the airport.

684,$lurpy,"December 25, 2018",1,Not for the people First off what’s the point  of allowing separate payment options if you’re not going to charge any but the first one. My sister asked me to send for her a lyft and she gave me her card info to which I put in the app. I then selected that as my method of payment but not long after the charge hits my account instead of my sisters . I contact support they say there’s nothing they can do they already charged me no big deal. Except it happens again and this time it overdrafts my account and my bank was eager to slap a fee on right on top of it. So yeah lyft will get you overdrafted on Christmas that’s nice. Also they find little reasons to charge you a little extra here and there honestly this company is falling out of favor heavily and will no longer be on my phone as we begin the new year.

When she was trying to start over, it was hard for her to see the back arrow against the background of the map. She had some other issues I couldn’t quite figure out over the phone, but the gist is that she simply couldn’t see the navigation options.

On top of that, the other rider was dropped off first Dyer he was picked up second. This instantly got under my skin. Especially because the company adds the ride without any consent of the driver.

The icon wasn’t there, so I couldn’t do what they advertised themselves as capable of doing. What’s worse, I couldn’t find a functioning customer service number to call to address the issue.

Second, In another experience, I got charged a cancellation fee. I did cancel, because the app said it would’ve took 15 mins for the driver to come to me! It’s fair to cancel without a fee, right? Each and every time they give me credit back but I don’t want credit. It clearly wasn’t reasonable to charge me to begin with. You can’t even fight the fee because they have automatic responses, not by a real representative. It just seems like Lyft will charge you whether you’re right or wrong.

I’ve had traumatic experiences and I just wish they had an option for people to get a ride from who they’d Feel more comfortable with. Like Women drive women or men drive men women drive men men drive women option etc...you should keep customer safety and comfort deeply in mind."

I’m guessing she didn’t want to cancel?  Then I had another driver accept and finish a ride for about 15 minutes, then cancel my ride.  I got another driver only 5 minutes away who then cancelled as well.  I finally got another driver who was also 15 minutes away.  After waiting about 10 minutes and seeing that he was still 12 minutes away, I decided to cancel.  Then Lyft charged me a $5 fee after waiting for a ride unsuccessfully for over 45 minutes.  After I disputed this charge, they gave me $5 to put towards my next ride.  I don’t want credit.  I want my $5 back.  Probably gonna switch to uber for a while."

710,milestome,"December 22, 2017",1,Do not use Lyft as they careless for both customer and driver I am a Lyft driver for almost 6 months. I was involved in an accident two weeks ago while driving two passengers. A vehicle was hit me from the back while I was waiting for a traffic light. My account was deactivated since then. Lyft would not let you know there is $2500 deductibles out of your pocket if you have any lost. And they would not let you know you have to wait endlessly for responding from support team if you need help. They would not let you know your personal Insurance company will kicking you out and you have to pay extremely high for finding another insurance company if you get caught using a personal vehicle to earn fees. Please do something as a responsible company for both customer and who earn money for them.

It’s not necessarily the greatest thing to do but sometimes if I would prefer a girl driver I can cancel so long as I do it within 2 minutes of having a driver selected.

Most specifically if they are dog friendly! Some people don’t mind dogs in their cars, and it would be great as a rider if I could indicate when booking a ride that I have my dogs with me, and then only be paired with drivers who have indicated they are dog friendly. But I could see that working for drivers who are car seat equipped, or even language settings! I think this would really help passengers get paired with the perfect driver!"

Along with Southern folk who act pure but are made of poor soil for they are not pure. So hopefully my remarks will be taken with a seriousness and proper understanding of the truth prevails.

I am no longer a customer due to my last ride-the driver drove like a bat out of hell, made me spill my drink on my uniform on the way to work, the drink also got on the seat, I wrote Lyft regarding the driver & they wrote me back to inform me they charged my card for damages to the drivers seat.

One of the drivers we encountered accused of us making a mess in the car which was there when we entered the car. Lyft then charged an additional $50 for the damage and the pictures they sent us showed us was two pieces of lettuce and a couple pieces of rice. Again not done by us and even if it was pictures did not warrant the $50! Also the driver shoved another passenger in the car after he was accusing we made the mess. After the ride, Lyft apologized for the shoving but kept the $50 which didn’t make any sense. We tried explaining numerous times it was false accusation and that shoving a passenger is not acceptable but all we got an apology and we had to pay! Will never use Lyft again."

When I got notification that he arrived he was unhelpful finding him on the phone. It was busy I understand but when I got in the car he looked up my destination and told me I have to get another ride because he wasn’t going to New Jersey tonight. So I got out hooked another ride and had to wait again. This may be the last time I use Lyft especially in Philadelphia. Too many nuisances like dirty cars floors windows and signs in the car suggesting I tip now while I’m in the car. I treat the drivers just like in a restaurant I tip when I’m at my destination or as soon as I can afterwards. But waiting and than being told to find another ride is totally unacceptable.

Once they got to me they declined my ride saying that they didn’t want to do an airport run and then they drove off with my suitcase in the trunk. I couldn’t rate the driver poorly through the app since they never actually completed my ride. I’ve also had drivers accidentally cancel my ride midway through the ride and then just drop me off early/take me bad to my starting point because they weren’t gonna get paid for the ride. I always carry cash and told them I could pay them that way. Still they wouldn’t take it. Just take a taxi instead. Much more professional and reliable service.

You never know if they will drop you off where need be it. I find that when I let Lyft know the issues they have no problem compensating for credit. So for that reason I will continue to use the Lyft. 90% of the time everything is good. I do notice there is a severe gps problem also.

BUT he went to the Walgreens in the middle of the block & called me. The text also said my driver was here. He was NOT. The delay made me late. I also had to get out of the Lyft mid block to make it to work. Lyft did not make good on the ride & did not rectify the situation to my satisfaction. They stated, “well, you took the ride.

I waited until I had to leave and requested a ride, which the app made it so easy for me.

I really want to use Lyft for my business rides because they have better rewards (personal credit and Delta miles) compared to Uber which I believe has hotel points for business users. Lyfts offerings are what has me wanting to use them over Uber but these software frustrations is making it difficult for me."

I reserved a ride with Simon Jr who drove a Nissan Altima at Newark Airport. It was a longer wait than usual because it was evening rush hour. I followed his progress on the app while I waited in the agreed upon location. Just as the app informed me that he had arrived he cancelled the ride.  I was quite surprised and annoyed as I had been waiting a while and it was quite cold out. I reserved another ride that I had to wait another 18 minutes for. This is not the first time this has happened to us. It has happened on two previous occasions. I am bewildered as to why a driver would arrive at the location only to cancel.

I got replied yes but he is dropping someone at jfk so he said wait 18 min instead of 12 so I did so but then after 20 min he never moved from jfk and canceled the ride and at this point he made my wife late to work now a 3 driver came and canceled 2 min away.. you guys need to screen the drivers properly and I won’t be using lyft anymore or drive for lyft anymore this is ridiculous.
738,Bad at singing,"May 29, 2019",1,False ETAs every time Lyft will tell you before you commit to a ride that you will arrive at your destination at a given time. Every single time you initiate the ride it will then increase your ETA anywhere from 5-15 minutes. I believe this is a predatory practice meant to entice riders and hide the fact the drivers are spread too thin. Also they don’t pay a large amount of their drivers a livable wage or protect them should they fall ill because they are “independent contractors.” I only use ridesharing apps when I I absolutely need to because I’m so opposed to their practices and it’s now near impossible to hail a cab in most metropolitan areas thanks to them. They’re monopolizing our commutes and being propped up by venture capitalism because they still somehow aren’t profitable. They’re just here to bust unions.

I believe Lyft resolves the matter but it was hard to reach them to correct the matter. Lyft needs to work on their methods of contacting them to resolve problems.

I’ve had several issues, however where the GPS “pings” my location inaccurately. This has occurred for both pickups and drop off locations. Obviously it’s more inconvenient for pickups, since I’m not in the car to help redirect navigation. Just make sure you double check the location before letting GPS automatically mark the location. It’s always been super easy to contact the driver to help relocate, and I haven’t had issues there."

Not only did they only charge me a $1, (the ride was gonna be 18$) I got a text from someone named Rob 5 minutes later, apologizing to me for missing my train and gifting me 5$ credit towards my next ride.

Recently I had a situation where I left my scooter in a drivers car. I contacted the driver immediately and also lyft customer service. They explained that they will contact the driver and will keep me updated. Fast forward three weeks later. It still has not been resolved. I was told that there drivers are independent contractors and are not required to keep in direct contact with them. That’s ridiculous! Then I was told that no further action will be taken and that I need to contact the police in order to file a report. Why should I have to do this if we know who has the scooter. You have all of his info yet you can’t reach him???? This makes no sense to me. Please do better LYFT

But recently I had a ride to my Phychiatrist with Uber where the drivers lack of knowledge of the area caused me to be late to my appointment. In turn I arrived so late that the doctor had left. Also they charged me a 35$ no show fee. I searched and searched for a phone number to speak to somebody at Uber but I couldn’t find one so my correspondence with them was all through email. They would not even give me a discount on my ride. That’s some pretty bad customer service. So from now on I’m with Lyft.

When the time came for me to leave I submitted request for another ride and told the driver what happened. I asked did she have a phone number because I wanted to file a complaint. She did not have a number and I was not pleased with how in knowledgeable she was.

But 9 times out of 10, the DRIVER does not know where this pick up area is. Multiple times I’ve had to cancel and request again, then end up paying premium prices for single rider service.

And it’s all a tactic to oppose and defame the city’s enforcement of humane regulations that would protect drivers.

Yet rides come in mere minutes generally. I have had to wait longer when the Lyft app thinks I am somewhere else. This happens most frequently at the Castro Valley BART Station. If I request Lyft while inside the station the app thinks I’m on the other side of the freeway. Drivers meander around and can’t find me. Then they text and I tell them where I am. Then they have to go around to find a way to cross the freeway. That’s why I give it only 4 stars.

I texted the driver my exact location then I called twice and the driver didn’t answer. Lyft charged me a 5.00 cancellation fee. I requested a refund and they said I didn’t meet the criteria to receive one. I responded I am entitled to a refund. Lyft is reviewing my request.

I live in Los Angeles and someone in Miami is using my account. I have never been to Florida. Lyft has done absolutely nothing and instead blames me for ""not keeping my passwords secure."" All they did was confirm it was my account used in Florida so there's nothing they could do. I've never lent anyone my account information ever. After googling for a bit it turns out there are other people this has happened to and most of the time they have to contact their bank and get a new bank card. Save yourself the trouble. DO NOT USE LYFT. It's not secure with your information. Apparently it's easy for hackers in Miami to use your account for rides at your expense and Lyft will do absolutely nothing."

Luckily it’s a small airport and the security is a bit more lenient than, say, JFK or Atlanta."

People got in my account and cloned my number. With that, they got access to my Lyft app payment (in which used my credit card). No big deal, I thought, I just need to change my password and delete my payment record. That's when I realized Lyft doesn't protect the app with a password. Anyone with your phone number and access to your texts can use your credit card to call rides. But the best part is that Lyft claims it can't DELETE MY CARD INFO. So they suggested that I just ""change my phone number"". So now I have to cancel my card just because they cannot deal with such simple task of having a password in their system."

Once in Indianapolis and twice in California the app would not load in the places Where I was stranded.  The California airport only allows Lyft drivers and not Uber but I could not order the ride because the app would not load when at the airport.  I tried setting up a ride before I got there but it would not allow me to do so.

The problem comes in with their mapping app. The routes they select often are not the most efficient by my standards. But worse is that all too often they send the drivers to the incorrect address. And when you try to contact the driver and change it it gets very difficult. I’ve had several rides this year lost and then have been charged for them by Lyft because of their incorrect address. On the plus side Lyft has always refunded my cancellation or non-show up fee when I objected.

The first one was early in the morning and my driver respected that and kept talking to a minimum. The second was later in the evening and he had candies for me and my friends to share. And the third ended my busy day by taking me home where we talked about how great Lyft was. Having done Uber and Lyft himself he informed me that Uber drivers only have to do 2 background checks and Lyft drivers have to do 7. He’d quit Uber recently and we both came to the consensus that Lyft is amazing.
825,Zackikazee,"May 26, 2019",2,"Losing business The actual function of Lyft is great, but god forbid you ever leave something in a Lyft. You can’t get ahold of your driver, you can’t talk to anyone at Lyft (THERE’S NO NUMBER YOU CAN CALL TO TALK TO A HUMAN), and the automated responses are way too slow. I am currently stranded at a ferry dock possibly for the next two days with no money and nowhere to go. This is because I was stupid and left my jacket with my wallet and passport in the vehicle, because my driver didn’t notice me running down the street right behind the car and yelling and waving. It’s also because she rejected my call 6 times in a row, and then the option to call disappeared from the app. "

When I contacted them they refused to call me and there is no customer service line for customers. Over email every question that I asked was deflected and never answered and I never got an email from the same person despite the fact that I have been emailing them for almost two weeks. The only resolution that I got was that I needed to talk to my bank about getting my money returned. Lyft will not take responsibility for money stolen using their app nor will they answer questions regarding their policies. Use at your own risk!!!! If you haven’t used it in a while delete your card information.

There really needs to be an option to choose not to update your ride because it often ends up taking longer to wait for the new ride. Also wait times have been.. really incorrect lately, it’ll say anywhere 2-5 minutes, and I’ll get drivers that are 15-20 minutes away.

Such behavior should not be condoned by any hospitality business, especially when its employees are putting others’ lives at risk. After months of neglecting our complaint, somebody finally responded with a nonchalant $7 refund for the ride and a guarantee we wouldn’t be paired with that driver again. What a slap in the face. Absolutely pathetic. Uber it is."

First, I think the lyft app should have gps directions. The app shows where you are, tracks you, and has a map, so why cant you add a blue line and a voice telling me where to go. I Also think, the scooters should have a phone holder bc I was trying to follow directions, but I couldn't see my phone to see what street I was supposed to turn down. I do think the idea of lyft is great and is very convenient. I would definitely recommend lyft to someone."

For starters, It shows you different wait times between when opening the app and when requesting a ride. The app has inaccurate wait times, which leads to cancellations. Then it shows whether your driver is dropping off a passenger before picking you up next... Like why? Why do I need to know this. It only annoys the hell outta me.

I’m not sure if it’s just giving the driver my location as being the closest big known business name or if it’s giving them the closest main road but when you’re in industrial park it’s really not OK that you have to run to get to your ride every day

In San Francisco, I’ll routinely get an additional pickup that’s completely in the wrong direction, and will usually have to cross Market St (which is a massive nightmare in this city) and then cross back to continue going where I’m going. My route will go from 12 minutes without pickups to over 40 with 2 pickups AND 2 drop offs before I get where I’m going. It’s getting really annoying and will probably switch back to Uber soon unless they correct these algorithms. "

It’s convenient and affordable. One suggestion to make the app more pet friendly is to add notification, flag, or a filter option to let the driver or the passenger that the ride is pet friendly. Otherwise the customer will need to contact the driver and confirm that the driver can accommodate pets, if not it’s an inconvenience for both passenger and driver to cancel the request and start over."

It truly served my purposes and all my drivers were awesome except for this one woman who made me walk 6 blocks because she did not know how to navigate through the traffic in her own city. She actually told me to get out of her car because she wouldn’t be able to get me there! What lady... and I was charged over $15 for that ride... all my friends caught Lyft and there were dropped of to the front door of the Hyatt. I was so upset but more importantly felt unsafe because of the unfamiliar territory. I almost never want to use Lyft again because of that experience. I’ll have to really think about this one.

866,acmilligan,"July 31, 2018",5,"Uber vs Lyft I find the lift drivers to be better well dressed and have their cars a lot cleaner and well-maintained.  They understand when you don’t want to be spoken to, and they also understand when you could use a listening ear.  But that just comes with practice at being a delivery driver some people don’t want to talk at all and others just don’t want to stop and you can be aggravating sometimes but if that’s what it takes to get a good tip then that’s what you need to do be courteous and respond to their questions."
867,jwphi,"September 15, 2018",5,"First time user Our son suggested using Lyft for a recent trip. Signing up I realize they have a partnership with delta airlines. Initial scheduling was confusing when I entered the wrong pickup address, didn’t know how to edit, so I canceled and entered again. Driver was on time, very friendly and made our trip better not having to park at the airport, not to mention the cost savings. Used Lyft again on the trip and another good experience.  We look forward to using Lyft again and very pleased with the service. Good first time experience."
868,Kittyhiss,"October 17, 2018",5,"Real pickup time? It always says 1 min away and in reality the driver is at least 10 min away bc they have to go a longer way to get there. Then, after waiting, the driver gets a different easier pickup and cancels halfway. Or, they say they are at the address when they are half an avenue block away and then they say you were not there and you get a cancellation fee. As a person with a disability, this is not acceptable. Tell the accurate pickup time, get your addresses correct, and have driver call before leaving."

They arrive quickly and let you know when they’re there on the map which is pretty convenient, if I say so myself! All the cars I have been in so far are in great condition they smell nice, no cigarette smell, Courteous, and I will obviously call for a ride again! Robert And Nettie in San Jose ca are great! Nadi waited for me to get my Starbucks for a good five minutes and she didn’t never once complained and she is very sweet!"

Recently, i ordered a lyft and it never came it just stood in place for 10 minutes straight! So I had to cancel it. Then I tried again but the lyft driver I got assigned to was far away, so it reassigned me to a driver that was going the wrong way , he/she wasn’t even on the right route to picking me up. So that got canceled... Last and final attempt , I was like okay finally someone on my route , when I got picked up the lyft that picked me up did not match the person on the app. A Courtney in a blue Lexus was supposed to pick me up instead it was a man in a white Jeep. At that point I was like whatever I want to go home but yeah. Lyft service has gotten horribleeeee!!!"

The app was phenomenal.. giving real-time update on driver’s proximity.. you can even see them on the map in relation to you. The destination arrival time was confusing because it wasn’t marked as such. I thought I was being picked up by the driver at the destination time. So after I confirmed, it told me the driver would be to me in six minutes and I had to scramble to make it to the pickup location. But it was a GREAT experience overall."
873,Perfectlyhuman,"December 26, 2019",4,4-5 stars for ease of use for newbie 4 stars since I still like making reservations via laptop and not pda and Lyft sent me straight to ‘pda app’.   So suggest adding website for those of us who don’t like putting vitals on pda for obvious reasons.  Otherwise was able to EASILY reserve in advance rides to and from airports from coast to coast with complete followthru.    Great experience.  Did have a little difficulty pulling up reservation on my Lyft ‘app’ as the Airbnb is better equipped for keeping trAck of reservations made and confirmed in advance.  So it’s getting there...overall great experience for first time
874,thisisbullnonsense,"December 21, 2019",2,"Supply & demand It is crremely rare to find a Lyft driver to pick me up from my home location because it’s located in South Jersey about 20 minutes into the pine barrens, so I can almost never order Lyft on the way someone, but I can at least order Lyft which has better prices and I would prefer to use to and from my destination, but I digress, Lyft is a great choice that I can usually take home, but it would benice to have some more availability, or at least more effort to pull someone even 30 minutes away. My hometown may be in the woods but it’s about 45 minutes from any city- which is minimally $50 to Lyft. Usually we go somewhere with a minimal $15-$20 cost, which I think would be worth it to some of your drivers if they knew it was available. Especially when the area I am from most people would tip incredibly well.  "
875,Unsatisfied Lyft Rider,"December 3, 2019",1,Stealing money from riders isn’t ethical My driver who goes by the name Worku didn’t show up to the main entrance of the hospital where I was to be picked up. I called him several times and he kept hanging up then I was charged a $5 fee for no show. I was where I was supposed to be and went out of my way to contact the driver to be sure we were on the same page. I assume he kept hanging up because it’s easy for Lyft to scam riders out of a ride by claiming the rider never showed up when in fact I was exactly where I needed to be. This isn’t the first time lyft has scammed me out of a ride like this and I’m under the impression that it’s a scheme that drivers are aware they can get away with and I’m onto it now. Going to start using Uber is this happens again.
876,Dannyll7,"November 26, 2019",1,"Might switch back to Uber I normally prefer Lyft, but I might have to switch back. I ordered a Lyft that was taken by someone else. I contacted Lyft support and my representative was trying to tell me policy did not allow him to issue a refund. After a bit he reviewed my situation and told me he couldn’t issue a refund due to proof that I changed the destination on the lyft. He said the iPhone that changed the destination was the same one that I used to order my last lyft, but he said it was an iPhone10,5 and I’m not sure what that is, but I have an iPhone 8. Also half of the world has iPhones how can you use that as validation. I actually saw how much I spend on Lyft and it was over 200$ this month alone. You guys just lost a customer over one puny situation."
877,KING of DISTRACTION,"November 18, 2019",1,Fix your algorithm already Have been late too many times because Lyfts rideshare algorithm thinks it is okay to accept other riders that are back in the direction your trip already came from? No logic here. Let your drivers choose to accept riders along their routes and don’t automatically assign riders like this. Even the drivers complain about the algorithm. 
878,skinnyleenie,"October 22, 2019",2,"Time estimations I believe your system is flawed and not coordinating this difference correctly for the destination estimates of customers added to as a Lyft driver’s destination after his current drop off. Being added after a current drop off has changed my drop off times on numerous occasions and now made me late to work a number of times. I don’t believe this is the fault of the drivers. In my opinion, when one of your customers chooses a personal Lyft ride (not shared) you should send them a driver whom is available. If this costs more; than that should be why luxury rides are available. I don’t really need a freaking hummer! I just need to get to work on time. Thank you."

How can it be safe for us to ride with him crawling around on a huge bus when it’s not for him to be tightly held in the backseat of a passenger vehicle in a strap-on baby carrier literally attached to an adult wearing a seatbelt?  It makes no sense.  Get it together, Lyft!  Your condescending, chiding email didn’t help either.  We don’t need you policing our choices as parents!"
881,Vieira Souto,"September 24, 2018",4,Lyft pricing and software issues You have no option for single rider since I do not want to automatically share my ride when I don’t know how much time the other passenger’s trip will add to my time.

Not all, but many drivers try to take a longer route to make money. I just recently went from the Bronx to Brooklyn and it took all of 38 minutes and $40 dollars using Via. When I took lyft for the ride back from Brooklyn to the Bronx they charged me $82 dollars, went by two airports no where near my house and it took an hour. AND ALSO THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER BUT A DRIVER SERVICE LINE ???? COMPLETE GARBAGE is how they treat their customers.

My life was completely in danger and Lyft refused to address the subject, or refund me my money- for a trip that’s supposed to take 25 minutes but instead took an hour.

When you place your point on the map, try to think of if you were the one driving so put it where you want to get picked up, like pick the side of the building where the front door is or where the cars usually drop people off at when they arrive at where you are.  The driver goes to where you put your pickup location.  Easy and simple."

What saddens me is that I take lyft to and from work everyday and there are no deals or no promotions for a person like me. I understand the help you guys give on far drivers or riders but for the short route day to day users we have no benefits. I’d like something where we can get discounted on short rides or a set fee for every ride for about a month without a membership fee. I know you guys will work Better and harder also to update your maps.

We finally got a chance to do a date night with out the kids and wanted to ride the scooters downtown. Each scooter we saw was a lyft scooter. The problem is that their scooters have a cut off time to ride. So after 10pm you cant use the “self service” transportation.

The only thing is, when I had to be picked up from work the person who got me took the wrong turn and it Took longer to get to my home then it was supposed to be and he spoke very little English.

Lyft has no way of receiving feedback from this situation on their site, and it’s happened to me twice.  Can’t use this service if the drivers won’t reliably come to the pickup point.

It took 10 minutes for her to get to us even though it said 4. When she finally arrived, she looked at my sister and said, “How old are you?” Confused, because this had never happened before I said “13”. She then said that she couldn’t go with me because she was under 18, even though I was 18. My friends have used so many uber’s and lyfts over the years even when they were noticeably younger then 18. I just stood there because I was kind of shocked. I canceled the ride which made me pay 5$ because it had been more then 2 minutes. Definitely switching over to Uber."

I wish I could choose the preferred gender of my driver. With me being a woman, when I take late night rides, I’d prefer to have a female driver. I know Lyft is always doing promos, but I’d love to see a loyal customer discount incorporated. For customers that maybe use Lyft everyday to get to work, it gets pricey. Maybe you can incorporate a discount for people that use the app more than 2 days in a row. And the discount would carry on until the “streak” is broken (A day is missed)."

Two years ago, the company diminished the rates per mile/minute, got rid of surge charges, and greatly diminished the amount one could earn on weekly bonuses. I used to make $1600 in a 50 hour work week. Now earning $1600 in 50 hours is impossible, even with the hourly and weekly bonuses. They also now limit use of the destination filter to twice a day, whereas it used to be that I could use it up to 6 times in a day. The only reason I’m giving them 2 stars instead of 1 star is because it enables me to work when it’s convenient for me."

It’s also quite frustrating to have to reenter the exact location of your pickup once you’ve chosen to order a ride."

If you don’t mind giving your money to an unscrupulous company, use uber. If you have principles then stick with Lyft but be warned this company is not much better.

I was at my hotel in Redwood City booking a ride to the airport, and Lyft indicated Jay in a silver Mercedes would be picking me up in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later Jay was still 1 minute away when he disappeared and Lyft told me to wait while they identified another driver.

I’d say about 80% of them are on the ball & know where to go & are able to communicate (I order Lyft’s for my 80 yr. old Mom)with me with specific instructions & then you get the other 20% of the drivers (like tonight I had to order twice because the driver was on the wrong street & I get CHARGED A $5 cancellation fee?!) I texted & called Yishi to ask why I see him on 5th St. when he was supposed to be in Pasadena? I told him where my mother was waiting & he hangs up on me & charges me?

After then I was getting charged the same thing I was paying already without the subscription claiming that there saving me 4 dollars saying it’s supposibly 24 dollars I always use it so honestly it’s bull crap doing the subscription costs 20 a month so won’t be using that again c: cuz I save nothing."
927,pollo picu,"November 4, 2019",5,The reality for drivers I usually choose LYFT over Uber because I assume the drivers make more money. But after talking to many drivers I’ve realized that Uber and LYFT have a ceiling built into the algorithm that keeps their hourly rat down.  Drivers who’ve been driving for 4 or more years remember the good old days when they could make 50 to 60 dollars an hour during surge times. Now they’re lucky  if they make $30 an hour at peak times. This should also apply to all LYFT and Uber employees. Including the executives.

After 20 mins I start looking for a way to contact lyft directly so I can cancel the ride without being charged and there is no customer service. Just those annoying automated messages. Ugh! Then 30 minutes, yes 30 minutes later a message pops up with info for a new driver. And I’m like what the hell is going on!? This is completely unacceptable. Someone needs to be communicating. It’s not the drivers fault either. Lyft you have to do better!"

There were instances where the driver would come from some far flung neighborhood and then pick up someone in a totally different part of my borough. Nothing about the sharing makes sense. The only redeeming factor is that it's slightly cheaper than Uber, but if I'm about to spend three times as long in a car - longer than it would take me to walk or wait for a subway- then you have failed. And being less effective than the NYC MTA is really saying something."

He then told me he has someone else now in front of us but please wait for him and it’s now 6:30 pm. I cancelled and my husband ordered a driver on his phone same thing happened and they switched the driver too. Once we got the name of the new driver he called her to get a more definite ETA.

I got a driver confirmed almost immediately.   The morning of my pickup the app reminds me of my ride and to be ready.   Ten minutes before my pickup it goes into search for driver.  It went through 5 drivers.  Each time pushing my pickup up later.  I was going to the airport.  I was picked up 30 minutes late.  I  almost missed my flight.

How is it $1.50 more to go to my address and then $1.50 less to go AROUND THE CORNER to an address thats FURTHER than my normal routine. I am on to you LYFT. Customers beware. They also start charging $2 cancellation fees or more when clearly you cancel in less than their “2 minute wait time “ and try to “return” it as credit. Hence the company still gets your money in their pockets. You have to FIGHT to have the “credit” returned to your actual payment method. No real customer protection either.

My drivers get lost not knowing there are multiple stores and which one to stop at. Just 2 days ago I had to keep crossing the street and running up and down the strip after my driver because he couldn’t figure out where the point was.

If you don’t cancel super quick you still get hit with a cancel charge, despite how inaccurate the advertised time was - so pay very close attention, especially AFTER paying, so you can cancel if needed."

My personal experiences in life have made me aware of the fact that I do my best thinking when I'm multi-tasking, doing more than one thing at a time. Lyft allows it’s busy customers to not  have to stop and take forever doing one thing the drivers who drive Lyft vehicles, are ready for you almost sooner than your ready for them... great service very reliable."

977,Kaykay460,"August 29, 2018",5,So much better than Uber I’ve been using both Lyft and Uber to compare two different services and now decided to stick to Lyft. Most of the lyft drivers I’ve encountered are more professional and kind than Uber drivers. Perhaps Lyft does better job with selecting their drivers to hire. I feel safer getting a ride with Lyft than Uber. I also don’t like how Uber only gives 2 min to meet the driver whereas I have 4min for Lyft. I feel like Lyft cares about the customers (passengers) and offers good user experience. Highly recommended!

But we stood outside in the hot sun for 30 minutes with a baby, while three other drivers gave up and literally cancelled the trips. I explained that we were at the Marriott’s Residence Inn to one driver and he went to Spring Hill. I could see on the map that he was close but he disappeared and a new driver was in route. Needless to say we arrived lave for an appointment that we would have been about 30 minutes early for if the first driver had picked us up."

980,Fhjiyshjordn,"May 3, 2018",2,"GPS feature is TERRIBLE I should honestly know better than to trust Lyft’s “predicted arrival time” feature at this point. It is so incredibly, consistently misleading. Most often, if I take a Lyft it is because I am trying to save time. Obviously the drivers can’t do anything about traffic conditions, so I don’t blame them, but I often have to wait twice as long for my driver to arrive to pick me up as the app tells me. Worse, my ETA will slowly creep up by an average of 15 minutes. If my trip is going to take 35 minutes instead of 20, that’s fine, but it would be helpful to know! I know traffic prediction isn’t an exact science, but this app almost ALWAYS gets it way wrong."

In the midst of confusion in a busy ride-share area of the hotel, I saw my name written in a whiteboard that was sticking out of her moonroof. My husband and I both chuckled and thought it was a nice touch! Since she is a native of Las Vegas, She proceeded to share some great places to visit while we were visiting Las Vegas!

989,tweeting diamond,"August 20, 2019",3,It’s to bad. They give discounts to those who barely use the service. None to those who use the service regularly. Inless you have a elite master credit card. Then if you take 5 rides you get a $10 credit. That us regular users who don’t have the elite master credit card pay for. An still don’t get any discounts. So Lyft doesn’t care about loyal customers inless again you have the credit card there promoting. So I don’t use Uber but if another company shows up you bet I will be checking in to them. Lyft don’t even send me a personal discount. Loyal customers should have been taken care of already.

994,foreignn96,"February 7, 2020",5,Safe. I don’t ride with Lyft anymore because it’s more expensive then Uber and it’s gotten expensive to the point I couldn’t afford it anymore and couldn’t get to work. It’s literally like a 5$ different. That’s a big jump. I use to be with Lyft because they had safe drivers. I personally like the Lyft drivers better then the Uber drivers. I took Lyft today because he was closest and it made me remember how nice the drivers are. Sometimes a little bit more expensive is worth it. For your safety.

I called the driver to make sure where he would be picking me up.

I waited over an hour for a car because getting a ride is terrible at LaGuardia Airport. My driver kept showing he was coming and started my ride. However, his car kept stagnating on the map. The driver kept dodging my calls and when he finally picked up, he said he was nearby. After over an hour, he cancelled the ride and the the app showed he had actually driven half an hour away! Customer service was non responsive and kept sending generic messages. I have spent hundreds on this app but they clearly don’t care to retain their customers.

I live on the west side of Telegraph Hill yet they always send the drivers up to Nob Hill when I am going to Telegraph Hill.

It’s not right to have a custom option if you can’t truly customize it... you are limited and let’s say someone wants to do more than the lowest amount yet less than the medium amount given? If it’s a low fare ride and you liked them, than adding more than $1 and making it a 20% or slightly higher tip is not allowed. This is annoying and slightly manipulative. Don’t like this change. I’m sure many don’t either."
1005,pleasemakesurethingsworkright,"October 27, 2018",1,Ridiculous company I accidentally left my phone in the car and realized it within 2 mins. I used a different phone to contact Lyft who then said their procedure is to submit a lost and found ticket and turn around time is 24 hours. And due to ‘privacy concerns’ they could not contact the driver. Not even considering I was from out of town and getting on an airplane in 30 mins. Was able to log into my phone carrier and get the number of the driver (after 45 mins) who was already on another trip that was out of town. The number wasn’t even her actual number so the whole privacy thing is BS. Luckily my driver went above and beyond to get me my phone back overnight. No thanks to Lyft. Never using them again.

Lifts response was to give me a $15 credit. I told them that on top of that I refused to pay for my Lyft ride that night(good timing that my credit card expired so I was never charged). I emailed them multiple times saying that they needed to remove the charge. They emailed me back avoiding the request and main issue. My final email weeks ago said that they need to remove the charge or I will delete their app and never use them again. There was no response. It makes no sense. They can’t charge me for the ride anyway but they would rather lose a customer over it.

As someone who uses a car service over 10 times a week that adds up to a lot of savings in a week/month. Who doesn’t love that? So it looks like I’ll be a regular Lyft customer from now.

Today I was told by a friend that lift has switched  the screen so that instead of the first choice being the economy it now shows a higher service level so you pay more per ride.

Adjusting the pick up point is a little wonky, as well, creating an imprecise method of creating a new spot.

When you schedule a lyft which I often do at night for the next morning a driver will accept and it will say picked up by the driver . Then the next morning 5 minutes before set scheduled ride the driver will cancel leaving you scrambling to try and find another Lyft at very short notice . I’ve actually been late to work due to this . I feel that the driver should in some way be penalized the same way the rider is when they cancel a ride on short notice .

Confusing because even if you’re not in right place the driver will he messaged you’re in the pick up zone. U need to get exact directions from lyft stating where the pick up zones are located otherwise it’s frustrating and you’re likely to just grab a cab. So lyft, be more clear with your pick up locations  for passengers and drivers."

I added my bank card to my account just to be prompted to add another with the same address “for security purposes” and so I did...neither of my cards were accepted so I then put in my credit card just to have the same issue, so being the persistent person that I am I went ahead and added my paypal account, and what do you know it didn’t take...I took an extra step by purchasing a gift card and that didn’t work neither, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it just to find that my gift card is no longer on my account!!

Obviously I ended up contacting customer support to get my stuff back and they called me right away. Hopefully I get my wallet back with EVERYTHING in it."
1037,KSRHDD,"August 2, 2019",1,"Needs updates I use Lyft fairly often. There are problems with almost every single ride. The maps are always behind the driver, the driver never knows where to find me/is always at least one block away from the pick-up spot, the pin drop is never accurate. This morning I was looking to request a ride and Lyft told me I would have a driver in 3 minutes, so I requested a ride. The driver did not get here until 15 minutes later and of course if I want to cancel the ride to see if I can get a driver before the app does, I have to pay $5. You can’t count on Lyft. Uber’s PR is awful, Lyft simply doesn’t work, anyone else want to step up and take a whack at this market? You won’t have much competition."
1038,Nyirra,"July 14, 2019",1,"Unprofessional First of all let’s start off with the fact that Lyft is expensive. Their prices go up every second. Just to go down the street they’re tryna charge you $10. When drivers mess up your ride, when they’re rude to you, when someone else takes your ride Lyft will not give u a refund. Why? Because they don’t care that’s why. We’re just a $ to them. I had a Lyft driver that made me super late to work because of his actions. He drove me half way to my job and drove me back home because he said his Lyft app still shows as if he didn’t pick me up. I complained about it. The nerve of Lyft to say they don’t see a problem with it, is EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. Lyft needs to do better, or Uber is gonna take all their customers."

There is no phone number to call to speak to a person in real time, only emails that never receive a response. This company has the worst customer service I have ever seen, and I will never use lyft again in fear that I will once again be charged for a ride I did not take/request and never be able to get my money refunded. Extremely frustrated and upset with my overall experience using Lyft."

This isn't directed at every driver, but drivers that don't seem to want to come to pick you up, or mark that they've arrived when they are still several blocks away is super lame. This especially holds true when it's late or cold out. I rely on cab apps in some situations, but I'm considering staying away until you guys can fix your vetting process."

And I use Lyft faithfully everyday and for me to be having these issues I can only imagine. I’m Lucky to get a Get Drivers Those I don’t mind giving 5stars and those that are rude drives like a bat out of hell car smelling like Marijuana!!!

The app was showing the usual interval of time to be ready for pick up. But at the top of that time still no notice that anybody was coming and I live in a remote place outside of city limits so last minute with stress I found another solution to go to airport with high risk to loose a flight to Japan. There was no way to call a Lift Helpdesk only web assistance. This is not acceptable
1043,jade0rade,"August 9, 2018",2,"Poor customer contact Since I have been using Lyft, the drivers have mostly all been great.  However, lyft always directs the drivers to pick me up at the back of the apartment complex, where the back gate/entrance is permanently closed.  This causes a huge inconvenience for both the driver and myself.  For the driver, because he has to waste his own time and gas driving back around to the front of the complex.  It has caused an inconvenience for me, because I have been late several times due to the extra waiting time caused by this error.  Whenever I speak to the lyft drivers, they say there is not a way for lyft to update the maps.  Surely there has to be a way?"
1044,iMngoMgc,"August 25, 2018",3,"New Update is Horrible Lyft apparently removed the option to cancel a ride before pickup, which is extremely frustrating because the app constantly pairs me with drivers that are 10-15 minutes away even though it claims there are drivers in the area (2-3 minutes away). It’s even more infuriating because often while rushing I’ll select a shared and by the time I realize it, I can’t cancel to switch it. This seems to be a new update because it wasn’t like this a few weeks ago but who knows? Lyft and it’s inability to match me with nearby drivers is becoming intensely bothersome."

I drive with Lyft in Jacksonville and wondering why a 12 mile trip in Florida cost about $10-$12 but in Washington(Seattle) the same ride distance is twice the cost($25)! Fuel is only .50 more a gallon and the economy is about the same so why the huge gap? I’m gonna forget about driving anymore until there is equal pay for everybody not just certain regions. Sorry Lyft but I smell discrimination based on territory with the same economic challenges. I’m thinking I’m done busting my derrière for minimum wages compared to out west! West Coast is eating Prime Rib & I’m doing little beans & wieners!

It should not take 10 minutes to request a ride, whenever I need to use Lyft, that’s ridiculous. I shouldn’t have to cancel and then request and cancel and request again. Come on guys. If you’re going to do this, do it right please. Also, the fact that you have the option to schedule rides and I can’t schedule the rides is ridiculous.

For example, If I ask the driver to come at 8 am, it’s going to schedule for arrival between 8-8:15am, adding 15 min buffer AFTER the target. This defeat the need to schedule. I might as well request as needed. It only takes a simple adjustment to have the driver start earlier and arrive earlier to better make the target time instead of leaving the anxiety to the rider."

He also mentioned you all do this all of the time and that if he would have denied the ride prior to my scheduled ride that you all would have fined him. He said that this is common and lyft does this all the time. His word for word statement was “lyft only cares about their money”. I just want you all to know that I spend good money using this service and I do NOT deserve this. I need to hear from management or lyft can hear from my attorney. Best believe I have all receipts and details to take this to the next level. Have a blessed day. Thank you!

It would save time if riders could select from drivers that have already indicated they will allow a pet in the vehicle. This could be expanded to include size/weight limits for the pet, and whether the pet can travel in the back seat with the owner or required to be in a kennel. My dog is small and very gentle, but when my husband has the car sometimes we need to run an errand or go to the vet."

Well apparently, what I paid was for the lyft I took LAST time, and I still have to pay the lyft I just took. This last time I used Lyft, was the first time I’ve seen it pay for the last THREE rides in a row, all at once. That’s about $36 dollars that should have already came from my card when I took the Lyfts weeks apart from each other. Figure it out, Lyft. Charge me before I even get out of the car."

It is easy to see on the app that there is no chance they are going to be anywhere close to 5 minutes. Tonight 9 minutes with several drivers closer, actual pick up time 25 minutes with no penalty.  We could see that our driver was more than 9 minutes out and still had to drop someone off. We know there are several drivers closer but If we were to cancel, $5 dollars.  We went out with 3 couples tonight. We were the first to request Lyft and waited 10-15 minutes after the other two couples were picked up."

I wouldn’t have an issue if the app says 15 or 20 minutes, I just don’t want to go outside to just waste my time waiting.

Many of the things I wanted to know came up as the trip developed like reminders, pay information, tipping etc.  I would recommend looking into finding a way to request a specific driver if coming into town knowing they were reliable and I felt safe."

I told him I actually couldn’t make it there on time. And the ride was cancelled by him and I was still charged $5. Yes i get it’s only $5 but he should have done his job because I was paying him to bring me somewhere. I don’t like that if he doesn’t do his job I still have to pay lyft.

So double check your address exact location and feel free to send a text or call your driver and point out any landmark to make it easier. Lyft’s drivers are far superior than other ride sharing apps for the most part. I believe they are vetted more strictly because I have had only positive experiences. They get customer service. A tip is always appreciated and valued!

And I'm sorry if I sound cheap but I am a college student and I don't have $5 here and there for Lyft to collect all the time.

I complained to Lyft about this and their response was oh , we won't pair you with this driver again. No apologies no refund nothing. They don't care. I mentioned I didn't want the driver to be driving but they didn't respond. Obviously they don't care about any passengers safety. All they want is your $$$.

I took screen shots of my route and it’s costs, then of the places the Lyft driver drive to that was not included in my drive, and asked for help to stop the charge. I received nothing from customer support. Lyft has been utterly unhelpful and unfair, so anyone who uses it, beware of that.

A particular recurring instance is the push notification that tells the rider that their driver has arrived and will be departing in 5 minutes. I received this notification during the ride, as I was being dropped off. The app is simply slow and does not update quickly. As a driver my passengers have received this notification as I am driving them to their destination, and it concerns both parties that they may be in the wrong vehicle / with the wrong passenger. Simply run diagnostics, user experience tests, and update your software to meet your demand."

Unlike Uber pool express, I’ve found that shared rides frequently take me far out of my way and that I arrive later at my destination than the app said I would be there by when I called the ride. I wish there was a way to provide feedback on the shared routes I get matched with and whether or not it was a direct route or if the shared ride took me well out of the way and was a terrible fit."
1085,S.Ch.92,"February 7, 2019",1,"Wrong addresses Never really had an issue with the app until recently. After choosing the correct name of my locations twice, the addresses have been wrong. The worse thing is that on one of them, it didn’t allow me to use pool or my promo codes, and because the address had been wrong, I ended up spending three times more than what it should’ve been with pool to the right address. The customer service just thanked me for letting me know of the ‘app error’ and that I should pay more attention to the address. If I’m typing in the right name of the location, and the App has the wrong physical address, why should we be penalized. After getting no resolution, I will be going back to Uber"

1088,TomAtlanta01,"April 29, 2019",5,Maps and closest location Just used the app for the first time. Tried to change destination to a nearby Starbucks near the end of the ride.  Was surprised that the app did not show me the possible Starbucks locations on a map nor the distance to the ones suggested. Ultimately I was guessing at Starbucks locations from the written list and editing the ride until I stumbled on one close to me. Not helpful in finding nearby retail locations (like a Starbucks) while en route.
1089,GreyscaleTyphoon,"May 23, 2019",3,"PLEASE MAKE A “NO TALKING” FEATURE!! I usually love using Lyft, but if there was something that would drive me away, it’s 50/50 chance I may have to talk to someone uncomfortably for an entire ride especially if the driver is the one instigating several conversations. Sometimes, I’d like to get into a car without feeling the anxiety about talking to a driver or coming off as a jerk for saying “I don’t want to talk, please”. An easy “Talk/No Talk” feature would take away that fear. I don’t care if I have to wait extra minutes for a driver who won’t talk, but if that’s what it takes to feel comfortable then I’d rather do that."

This happened to me twice today with different drivers going to the same place .... And it's not the first time. Management should take note of this situation.

I understand the drivers are independent contractors, but Lyft provided NO support or advice other than ""we'll let you know if they reply"". So for all I know, the driver was responsive but was given someone else's number instead... infuriating."

The options in the help dashboard miss the basic one of reporting a problem with a scheduled ride.  And NY Lyft drivers don’t call you, even though they have ur number. Not all will answer you if you call them.  Have had issues with not getting picked up more than once.  And having to eat the cost.  Otherwise, like the fact that it’s pickup is at specific locations, good pricing, clean cars, friendly drivers.  When it works, it’s awesome."

Again as I am happy with the service provided I am disappointed but I get no 50% off ride snow 25% off rides no free rides no kind of help for all of the business that I have given to Lyft."

I used to take lyft everyday, at all different times of day, and never have the prices ever been more than $20 for a 5 mile ride in Boise. Today I took a $15 ride up to my grandmas house to do laundry and then 2 hours later it was $35 to take the same trip back home. The same route the same distance. I have never spent that much on a lyft before, I’ve been using it since 2016. Then the customer service was rude and refused to reduce the price at all. I was a mile away from the nearest bus station and had two baskets of laundry. They basically trapped me into paying double because I had no other way to get home. I’m switching to Uber. They have much better customer service."

It’s annoy and I don’t want to be rude and tell them to do it themselves so can we please just cancel at their request? 
1104,AKJackle,"January 19, 2020",1,Overcharged I was drastically overcharged for a ride. The surge price wouldn’t go down and I needed to get home so I was forced to pay 25 dollars for a ride with no traffic and only 6 miles. I’ve been a loyal Lyft passenger for years but they managed to make me hate them. I spoke to customer support over the course of about a day trying to have them fix this but they absolutely refuse too. If they say they are user friendly it’s a lie because they surge up the prices with false reasoning and expect you to pay for it. They also try their hardest to avoid talking to frustrated customers and it’s a hassle to get somebody on the phone. Never in my life have I felt taken advantage of by an app like this but this is unacceptable.
1105,lakeeee00,"December 5, 2019",4,I like Lyft but I don’t love it I was always a Lyft user but switched to Uber for convenience. I don’t think Lyft is as convenient. For one I hate that Lyft sends way too many text messages when I also get push notifications when I order and get to my Lyft. I think that there should also be an option for NYers at least (I cant speak for everyone) who may need a car ride more often than not to get certain discounts or passes because it can get pricey especially at “peak hours”

Mind you I used to pay about $7 when I first got the app. Not only that but they don’t offer loyalty discounts. Today alone I spent about $70 on Lyft. You would think that they would hook it up at least once in a while and give a little discount since I use the app every day. At least Uber offers discounts like 20% off next five rides when they see that you’re a loyal consumer. F that I’m going back to Uber. You need to pay lyft to get a certain discount and then when you compare the price with Uber, they’re still cheaper!"

If I’m stuck in a bad area waiting for a Lyft, why do I have to wait 15 minutes for one that 3 miles away, while there’s one sitting right in front of me with an empty car waiting to get a ride request.  I was told by Lyft support, that the way it works is, whomevers been driving their shift the longest get first priority on ride requests. Even if The driver and passenger are 5 miles apart.  I’ve been late to work multiple times because the app tells me driver is 4 minutes away while in reality the driver is 15 minutes away.   So frustrated"

Whoever is in charge of there app QA is obviously on vacation. 50% of the time the app won’t work right after a update. I have asked drivers about this they just lol and say yeah mine has problem now too after the latest update.  When it works and if your not in a rush is works great. Seems to be whenever I am in a rush I have to cancel because they are picking up another person like 15 minutes the opposite direction. I can normally call a Uber and get to my destination by the time they cruise by. Please fix these issues lyft. Your a great option besides Uber when you work!
1111,PlayerPlayer311,"October 22, 2018",5,Better than Uber Lyft actually allows you to schedule a ride and set your actual pickup location. Apparently Uber simply calls for your ride at the time you selected. No guaranty that a driver will be available so you could still end up being late. Uber also changes the pickup location to some random place you can’t find. Or they expect you to drag your luggage to this mystery location they selected. I’ve had much better experiences with Lyft. Love it.

Then they canceled. Had to take a solo ride because no time to wait for another share. Cost me an extra $20.  Second was a ride from airport. First driver was 9 min away. Never even approached the airport then canceled after 7 min. Next driver picked up one passenger then got lost driving around airport and drove away. Third driver finally picked me up 40 min after my original pick-up time. Would have been faster and $30 cheaper to take the bus. Stick with Uber.

Now that i have recently just turned seventeen and I had to be kicked out of the lyft that I order to get to work to find out that you’ve changed your policy when you have both my email and phone number. This upsets me because I spend my money to get to and from wherever I’m going using this app. I was always respectful and thankful for the ride because I do not have reliable transportation to my job or to whatever place I am going.

1144,dancer12121213,"October 4, 2018",2,"Photographylover24 I always use this app, however, some people who drive the lyft need to understand professionalism. I had to use this app to get to a specific area of the city. However, when I was looking for my car it texted me that my ride was a few minutes away and I saw a lyft pull in and opened the door for one of them thinking it might be my ride. When I opened the door asking for the drivers name, the guy shouted “ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! YOU HAVE THE CAR AND MODEL IN FRONT OF YOU WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?!” It was just a mistake I made because my signal was going on and off and I assumed that car may be it. Very unprofessional and super rude! Please train the drivers into professionalism."

It has been a wonderful experience. Thank you"
1146,Comiczloph,"November 7, 2018",3,"No point in doing Ride Share Ride Shares are supposed to be cheaper while Lyft basic is supposed to be faster. I’ve been using Lyft for a while and it is progressively getting worse. The prices are going up along with the wait time for a ride. The last few times I needed a ride, it always takes about 15-20 minutes to get a ride. Even if it is Lyft. Either it’s because no one wants to drive in the area or because no one works for Lyft anymore. But it is definitely inconvenient for those who are going to class or work or anything that has an appointment."
1147,Javin M,"April 14, 2020",1,No point in scheduling rides I arrive at a specific location everyday at a specific time the app gives the option to schedule ahead of time so I do! But for the past week I’ve had the same problem every morning! My ride gets pushed back or the driver is over 15 mins away when i arrive at my location. I live in Atlanta where it’s heavily populated so you wouldn’t think I’d have to wait over 15 mins for a ride i SCHEDULED!! Yes it’s amid the COVID pandemic but wheres the customer service and the up holding your end of the bargain?! I’m outside waiting FREEZING because Atl has the most unpredictable weather for a ride I’ve had to reschedule over 5 times for a ride that was originally scheduled for 6 am SMH
1148,Marrietta K,"February 12, 2020",2,"Inflation of Prices Prices are the worst since they became popular. $22 for a 10-15 minute ride. Thats over $1 a minute. Prices were so much more convenient before Lyft grew popular. Also, my ride arrival times are not always accrue which can turn a 5 minute wait for a driver turn into a 10 minute wait especially if the driver has no knowledge of the neighborhood. So unfortunately if my driver is taking longer than the initial 5 minute wait I am stuck with that driver or charged a cancellation fee because the ride was supposed to be 5 minutes out. I’m so disappointed in some policies. Still a decent app just not as great as before."
1149,husaSab,"December 23, 2019",1,"Lyft is really unfair! It should not deactivate drivers for no reason! I have been seeing that a lot of drives are deactivated mostly for no reason. Why does lyft do that? As a customer, I hate seeing that those who drive me, take care of me and my safety, make me set in their personal car and put their lives at risk, are treated so poorly. Customers are not always honest so why lyft only listens to them and not the drivers? If lyft keeps on treating their drivers this way, the customers will soon boycott lyf. I wan lyf to listen to the drivers and give them a chance. Drivers have families, please do not deactivate them without listening to them. Please take an action and let the deactivated drivers have a second chance."

In that case they should pay you if driver does not get to you within one minute of promised time."

Also it cost waaay more than it should’ve because of the destination being off. The driver was very unsure how to approach the problem since the driver uses a different app and she said she needed me to change it. Frustrating & now im going to need to always have the exactly correct address even if in a pinch i dont know it! How do you edit destinations!?!?! Thank you

We tried to tell him where he was going he was combative and aggressive. He should not be working for Lyft.  He does not embrace the Lyft culture and should not be representing this company in any way that is respectable. He should not be working for Lyft.

Flight got in at 7am and put in the address where I’m heading into the app correctly, lyft comes and the driver tells me that the address I placed was the airport address which doesn’t make sense since I put in the correct address. Spend extra time and Money in the car than necessary and charged more than I needed to be charged. Customer service did nothing! and you can’t even call them depending on the situation no direct call number for them. I would recommend using a different app such as Uber if you’re coming in on earlier flights to the city"
1154,KingZuus,"April 2, 2019",3,"Convenient, But Not Enough I will say that the app is convenient when it wants to be. Lyft rides are usually cheaper than Uber when you have coupons and free rides. Sometimes Lyft will send two drivers. ETA very off needs to be synced real time. However, I must say that the app will take your money for whatever reason, or process payments for rides you have not taken. I have had the issue about twice already and upon talking to customer service they only offered a 5% off discount for both inconveniences. Very disappointed. Overall convenient. But has its faults."

This happens all too often, especially early morning. Also, an option to accept or decline a new driver. Sometimes it’s good that a 25 minute wait has turned into 5, but sometimes I’ve planned for that 25 minute wait and now I’m rushing when it pops up a new driver down the road that just turned on their app."

Some potential for growth - app can be glitchy and drop rides for no apparent reason, tips are limited and need more flexibility to tip drivers more initially and/or add on tips, help center feedback options include only set list and are mostly negative - leave room for positive feedback and option for “other” because chances are you haven’t thought of it all. Learn from your customers! Thanks for the service"

Feels like a trap, specially because if you cancel the ride you get a better match. It is seriously becoming really annoying to the point where I’m considering not using the service anymore."
1158,Scott Bradley Shrock,"October 4, 2019",4,Quality Most of the cars are excellent however the Uber/Lyft cars are in extremely bad shape falling apart rattling smell extremely dirty smells of burning oil. The cars I have been in that are Lyft only have been new clean comfortable. What happened to them regulating the cars age miles and passing emissions testing. Seriously the quality is dropping rapidly it’s becoming as bad if not worse than the yellow cabs. I wish they would pull the high mileage dirty nasty cars off the road and make people comfortable and feel safe and know they will get to a location on time.

1161,Lyft is trash,"June 25, 2018",2,"Lyft is trash Other than them probably being like $1 or $2 cheaper than Uber, they’re alright. They think the only gps they can use is one called waze, which never gets your location pickup or drop off correct, & which is 100% inaccurate.  Google maps works better and it’s something they need to use. A lot of the drivers have issues, meaning I’ve had some run red lights, some sit outside my location drop off a little too long which is weird, and some with nasty trash filled cars shouldn’t even be allowed to drive Lyft. I ALWAYS complain just about every single ride and it’s a pain so i don’t even recommend."
1162,TonoSensei,"August 10, 2018",1,"The app is ok. But the service In all honesty I would have liked to give this app more then one star however, I can not because I can never seem to get drivers to stop and actually pick me up. I’m always outside way before the driver comes and out of the 5 rides I booked, only one driver actually stopped to get me. The others canceled before even coming and flew right past me today as I was waving to him. I don’t think it was a GPS issue it’s a driver and app issue because if you aren’t of a certain demographic then there will be huge issues with the service thusly, in my opinion, it failed miserably.  If you are going to provide a service to the people, then please pick up all people smdh."

I would suggest to advice some drivers to watch their body odor. I know sometimes it is cultural and it is a sensitive subject but it can get very unbearable in certain occasions. Of course it is not everybody, but I didn’t want to give names since it is a sensitive topic but a reality that must be addressed. It is my only complaint. Other than that, I am a happy customer!"

You all should work on your pricing. Also since i dont have a car I always take lyft you all should have codes for people that rides lyft daily. You guys pricing is insane."
1166,Serj-Review,"November 9, 2018",1,"Long waiting Very bad service, I was waiting at LAX airport, the nearest driver was 20 minutes away, and they only let me know that after I ordered and paid. That's a ridiculous amount of time for ordering a car at an airport, it should be a matter of minutes. Saw a guy coming to waiting point C where I was, he ordered an Uber there and 5 min later it was there. Actually saw a lot of Uber there, feels that they are more prepared to service their customers than Lyft. Lyft needs urgently to improve their algorithm to find closer drivers or hire more drivers if the app is not a problem. That's not the first time it happens to me there at LAX, after a long trip from China it's unacceptable having to wait 20 min for a ride."
1167,Pinashion,"November 9, 2018",5,Dogs in car I was shocked to be refused a Lyft in a dark parking lot because I was carrying a tiny Chihuahua dog. I couldn't drive my car into the parking lot because of road closures due to the fires. I was left stranded on foot to rescue my dog. The driver suggested I ask one of the homeless people in the cars on the beach to give me a Lift to my car. He refused to help me get someone else. He said Lyft doesnt take dogs. Incorrect information! Another Lyft car promptly arrived and accommodated me. So I was grateful this Lyft driver cared about my safety thank you Peter.

If you can’t handle your liquor you shouldn’t be drinking simple as that. Now as for my review I feel that drivers should be taxed for cancelling rides when they are close to pick up. I had a guy cancel my ride when he was already at my location and I didn’t take long to get out either! It should be a discount for riders. What if I was late to work because he canceled? I love this service and it should be looked into.

I have to talk to her on the phone til the ride gets there because she’s afraid to be out there by herself waiting when the cars can just cmon 1 min more and just get her from the house!! Especially inconvenient when the weather is bad!!
1175,ItsMe_Vee21,"December 17, 2019",1,"Lyft has CHANGED With the new updates Lyft has now I dislike it. At the beginning Lyft had a good reasonable price for shared rides (I get it, prices will always go up). Now shared rides are literally 2 dollars difference (give or take... more give than take) from a regular ride all by yourself. When I have picked my destination and my location it is making me wait 2 minutes for a driver? The Lyft driver would always pick me up right on the pinpoint or least close by, now I have to walk!?? I don’t mind it. I love to walk and all but I’m getting Lyft really early in the morning for work, I don’t want to walk 3-5 minutes that early in the cold and dark to get to my pinpoint.

The estimate of arrival in heavy traffic appears to be the same as the estimate of arrival in no traffic. I have seen 1 minute wait times at an airport as recently as yesterday and had to wait 30 minutes! Absurd. Not waiting that long, but getting such a ridiculous estimate. Of course if I cancelled and took public transportation or a taxi I’d get charged because my driver was “only 1 minute away”. "

I’ve had friends that said they were offered discounts just for being long time riders and I haven’t been offered no type of discounts. I feel like lyft needs to do better with that because taking lyft everyday and everywhere can be quite pricey. Other than that, it’s not a horrible app just could offer more discounts to long time riders."

Each time I called the driver but they were unable to find my location. I had just gotten off the cruise ship at the Brooklyn terminal. I think every driver should know how to find that spot.

When I ask them if they can call lyft to state their problem and request compensation, but they chuckle and say “there is no one at lyft to help or pick up a phone”. Please provide better support for you drivers. It’s employees like these who keep my business, not Lyft as a corporation, and therefore you should try harder to provide them support and assist them."

Second why is the accuracy of the passenger pick up on the lyft map is so off, Uber app is almost 99% dead on showing where the passenger is to pick up. If Uber can do it lyft can do. Oh another thing is that why is there no privacy mode for how much you earn as soon as you end the trip? I don’t want passenger to see how much I earn, if I want to see it I can tap on my account later to see it. Give the app some privacy for the driver."

I tend to not overspend money and as a result mostly use the pool option when requesting a ride. Even though i understand the option implies a highly likely chance my route will be somewhat altered by a co-rider’s route, Lyft tends to not only pick up various co-riders for a relatively close destination but they also tend to choose pickups that detour my ride by sometimes up to 15 minutes. On the other hand, using Uber Pool, detours and the amount of co-riders pick up were consistently smaller."

After updating my card three times,v after four of the useless error messages from Lyft, somehow my card finally was accepted.

So the wait time is way off and closer driver can’t or don’t take the ride.. The driver I just waited 20mins for was driving all over the place and there was NO tag saying he was finishing a ride at any time… I tried re-requesting the ride and numerous times a driver over 10min away was allowed to accept the ride when there were 3 drivers on the map roughly 3-5mins away.. I done use it this service!!!! If people could rate rides they were forced to cancel, none of your driver would even have 4 stars. This app/system is very broken."
1199,chinadolln,"March 5, 2020",4,"Needs Some Improvements I love the Lyft app because I don't drive and need to get around. However, the app could use some improvements. The app runs extremely slow and you can't tell if your driver is actually going the right route because the car isn't moving on the app. It also doesn't display a real time location. You could be off by a lot if someone were to actually need assistance. With everything going on in today's society, the app should be made much more safe."
1200,LoveTravelAlways,"May 26, 2019",4,"Love it, I understand. Gps issues. Like I said I get it. Super populated area, crowded networks, the position will never be correct. But when I am outside the drivers car and it says my driver is still minutes away and that my location is moving into different buildings when I am standing still. A little annoying but yeah I get it and it is a great app with great service. BUT can’t give it 5 stars cause sometimes it says I am in the water waiting for a ride?? That be cool though, just use lyft for a lifeguard lol. Really a 4.9 star."
1201,ELisburg,"May 30, 2019",5,Suggestion I really enjoy lyft but one thing I would really like to see in an update is a button for “I feel like talking” or “I don’t feel like talking”. Some drivers really like to talk and sometimes I am all for it but others times I’m not (like taking a lyft after a long plane ride and I’m tired) but I feel rude not talking back and the driver isnt taking the hints. Nothing against the drivers it would just be really cool for driver and rider to know preferences right upfront!
1202,Stringy1,"March 4, 2020",4,"Great features but scheduling 😔 There are many positives like being able to leave a note when making a request. But....the same day scheduling needs improvement. In particular, if I schedule a pickup within an hour, the app will send a driver right away and I cannot cancel the request to try again.  My only option is to try to contact the driver directly and, depending on the driver or his/her mood, I might have to leave before I’m ready. But otherwise the app is pretty good."

I love that my loved ones can see where I am, the drivers always make sure I am who I say I am, and I get to where I’m going quickly and sufficiently every time. Also, it helps tremendously to get discounts here and there because I use it so often. My only critique would be to have more discounts available; pretty pls and thanks a bunch ❤️"

A driver responds that they are on their way...then disappear and I get charged 5 bucks because they didn’t show up!  It took me 45 minutes and 4 drivers to get picked up from hospital last Saturday.  Today was the same horror story.  I leave notes about location, so there’s no excuse.  The drivers who are really good are going to suffer from the others inability to do their job.  I hope it improves.  Otherwise I will have to go back to Uber."
1206,Mom24monsters,"November 10, 2019",3,"No watch app, but it is very accessible. I still have a problem with the fact that there still is no watch app. It was great when there was, and you would think that since the Apple Watch came out with the cellular version so that people wouldn’t have to have their phones with them at all times, Lyft would think about this and make it so that people wouldn’t have to have their phones as appendages, but apparently not. Lyft has move backward in time and regressed to only requiring phones. Other than that, the app is accessible to Voiceover users."

After receiving a second message that I was about to incur a no show charge with time expiring and being unable to reach the driver by phone, I cancelled the ride.  "

When I got in the vehicle he asked me how my day was going? And I responded why are you parking 200 yards away from my house? He then told me the ride was over and to get out of his vehicle...I didn’t got out of the vehicle and called Uber when I complain to Lyft customer support they told me I would not be paired up with that driver anymore and later that night they tried to hit me with $150 fee for spitting in his vehicle when I threaten them with legal action and they reversed their course I will never use Lyft again and I advise all my friends to do the same

I’m not leaving the airport. !!???  Really dude??? Guess my old fashioned way of thinking that a job is more than money, that It’s about helping other people, is out-dated.

1215,Jcst98a,"October 30, 2018",5,Neglect I’m so disappointed in lyft. Recently I took a ride to a city less than 20 minutes from me. The driver went to manhattan instead and made my fare go from about $17 to $70. I complained to lyft and they only reimbursed me $15. It is not my fault that I had the correct address in my lyft account and the driver chose to go into a different state to scam me out of money. I even contacted lyft and they have ignored my complaint. I have officially hopped back to Uber because at least they respect their costumers.
1216,Soaked Passenger,"November 9, 2018",5,Reyna Reyna was the first driver to pick up the ride. Upon her arrival she refuse to take me and my daughter stating I said it was one passenger which wasn’t the case. When I requested a Lyft the ride chosen showed 1 - 4 passengers never was I asked about the number of passengers. When I tried to explain she insisted I said one passenger. She would have been the reason I never use Lyft again. However Abu was very nice and courtesy. His customer service was impeccable because of him I may consider using Lyft again.

Got to my destination in a timely fashion and I’m home now. And I feel good not driving while under the influence.

1223,DebbieCakez,"March 6, 2020",2,"Unreliable Every time I use this app I get quotes for a driver who is at least 10 minutes away from me and told that it’s “the closest driver to me”. However I know that’s not true as I’ve been in the car with a Lyft driver and still had to wait for a different driver, only to have that driver cancel my ride on me. The app is unreliable and causes more confusion than anything. The only reason I didn’t give it one star is that it’s cheaper than Uber but I’m starting to realize that Uber is worth the extra money. Don’t use this app if you need to get somewhere by a certain time or if you need to make multiple stops!!"

The LAX new pick up area and system gives a false sense of urgency which is spiking the rates.  Mine is usually $47 to get to and from LAX and Fullerton, CA.   At baggage my quote was $47, but once I took the shuttle to the new pickup place my new quote was suddenly $132!!! I waited 2 min., checked again and then it went down slightly to $93.   I want at least $50 back.   You’ve lost my business and I travel a lot, as do my associates.   Very disappointed."

The return driver took me to an address on the other side of town. We got into this big discussion that I entered the wrong address. This was not the case. I’ll be overcharged and there’s no “person” with whom to speak about this issue. This was my first time to use Lyft. The app is confusing.

For example one drive had 2 phones and used Uber during my ride home. All I could do was poorly rate the driver .  I do appreciate your service and hope to see improvements .

When I checked the app again, it said my ride was Done & charged almost $10??? I have no idea what happened & I saw no way to message driver at that point.

On our way out of LAX, we had a driver cancel the pickup. Today we had a driver cancel the pickup at BUR.

I immediately got a message from Lyft telling me I was being charged for a “no show”. I re-entered my request for a ride because I needed to get where I was going and had no other option. A new driver, Jose, then picked me up right away and took me where I needed to go. I believe Natalia was a scam artist who just wanted the no show fee. I will see if Lyft will refund that charge, but will likely NEVER use LYFT again, despite how nice Jose was, because Lyft offers ZERO customer service."

I’m really glad I was able to tip the driver through the app since I rarely carry cash. I really enjoyed this experience and will continue to use Lyft in the future!
1255,Ominus 8400,"July 16, 2019",5,"Take Lyft at your own risk! First of all - the App is trash.  Can’t call in an emergency.  Didn’t update me about a ride I needed today to the airport.  I booked ride at 8:30.  . . waited 2.5 hours.  Finally, a friend stopped by and took me.  The app didn't even have a “ history” record of my trip request.  Okay so I am a Delta Skymiles member - Lyft is a partner so I will write them a letter. The “settings” link in the App is absolutely bogus- doesn't show anything relevant- trip settings, etc."
1256,Jes H.,"July 12, 2019",5,"Never a bad experience! Lyft is the only ride share service I have ever used because I’ve had no reason to try another one. It’s not too expensive, the drivers are always polite and have clean cars and even the music is always enjoyable. I have had awesome conversations and have even been prepped for a job interview while on a Lyft ride. I always recommend this service to someone looking for a ride share. It’s always a pleasant experience."
1257,Lynne pf,"July 6, 2019",5,"Great service At this point we have had 4 Lyft drivers beginning our summer vacation. Every time the drivers were friendly, polite, and precise on getting us where we needed to be.  All the cars were clean and comfortable. "

1259,HankHeim,"June 23, 2019",5,"First Time Users Beware I’m a middle-aged guy used to scheduling taxis hours in advance of a pick-up. So, for my first time use of Lyft, I thought it odd that the schedule-in-advance feature was hard to see. Then, after scheduling, because the app did not give me a “confirmed” message, I hit the Confirm button. My ride showed up in 15 min, not two hours later as I thought, because I had essentially booked twice. I had to pay a $10 cancellation fee. VERY unintuitive."
1260,Maxie Maxwell,"September 11, 2018",3,"The Lyft app is growing unfriendly to the blind. I have been using Lyft for about two years now, ever since I lost my sight. In most ways it is superior to Uber; however, after an update this summer, the app has been a little hard for visually impaired people to use independently. Specifically the price of a ride is not being transmitted through voiceover on the iPhone. When I swipe to the field, the phone only says ""price breakdown,"" rather than read the actual amount, forcing me to get a sighted person to tell me what I am paying. I don't like this. I hope it can be corrected."
1261,lori3168,"September 14, 2018",2,Scheduled ride I did not receive any confirmation that the ride I scheduled ahead of time was scheduled so I went ahead and scheduled with Uber who sent me a confirmation email.  Then in the morning I got a notification that my Lyft ride was coming in an hour. I tried to find out how to see if it was really scheduled but could not find that choice on the Lyft app. When I went to the contact us choice there wasn’t a choice for my issue so I couldn’t get help.  I was able to easily cancel
1262,CarRamaFarva,"September 14, 2018",5,"Never second-best I’ve had 100% totally reasonable, functional, as-expected service from Lyft and Lyft drivers. Sure, some transactions are unremarkable, but many are, may I say, exceptional. I don’t know what you may expect from a ride share, or the accompanying app, but for my part, I’m well satisfied. Lyft will have my endorsement for their consistent good service until they give consistent bad service, which I DON’T see as imminent in the near future. Nice job! Use Lyft with confidence!"
1263,ReverieLove,"September 15, 2018",5,"Rides slow like turtles Drivers should be required to have FAST-TRAK passes in California. It is a major inconvenience to have to wait in the traffic, watching all the cars flying by the traffic in the Fast-Trak lanes."
1264,Celene says,"September 24, 2018",5,One area for improvement I use Lyft everyday and prefer the functionality of the app to others.  I also like that i am not charged until my ride is over.  Lately however i have experienced less efficiency .  Driver arrival estimations are not correct and often continue to increase significantly after the ride has been requested.  Lastly all drivers should confirm that they have the correct passenger before they pull out.
1265,isoeditor,"October 8, 2018",5,Fantastic service but beware of cancellation fees My experience overall has been fantastic. But I also had two bad experiences in one day. That’s when two separate drivers didn’t show up and then charged me a $5 cancellation fee for no apparent reason. I also had a third instance where two drivers showed up for me. One of them tried to charge a cancellation fee. I’ve used Lyft about 20 times and the vast majority of my experiences have been positive.
1266,lesha🤳🏽✍🏽,"November 3, 2018",3,Ugh Is not that bad but I don’t like how every time I put my address where I’m at it sends a different some to the driver and the be at a different house and we both be looking for each other and I always get over charged for a wait fee when I was the one waiting because they gave the driver the wrong address is mad annoying cause I get charged for something that’s not my fault and is like no way to contact them Linda stupid same with Uber like this use to be helpful to me but now is became more of a problem lately they should really fix it
1267,Lonugkwv297,"November 19, 2018",5,"Works like magic! App works great. Service is great. Pickups are typically within 5 minutes in any city location. The app allows tipping after the ride is complete but is not required.  And the app can be set to only track your location while in use, not in the background, unlike their big competitor which tracks always or never. Sorry, there is no valid reason to track my location when I’m not hailing a ride. So long Oooober."
1268,Stubbysticks,"January 20, 2019",3,"Enhancement request: underage riders & car seats As a driver I’ve found a couple of important things riders generally aren’t aware of so it would be nice to present a message when requesting a ride to confirm two things: 1) that at least one rider is 18+ years of age and 2) if any riders are children requiring a car seat by the laws of that state, that they have one to use. "
1269,Ant Pete,"January 22, 2019",5,Better than the Uber one Update: TIPPING ON APP NOW STARTS AT $2.00! I used to tip in cash then add another dollar on app but not any more.

1270,person who can't read details,"February 26, 2018",2,"The Algorithm is Unreliable It seems that every time I need to get somewhere at some specific time, no matter how much in advance I order my lyft line, it manages to make me as late as I would have been had the train been running at minimum speed. I would be on a  traffic jammed highway, well on my way somewhere and the algorithm would force the driver to get off, waste about 20min and then get BACK onto the same traffic jammed highway. I have yet to ever arrive somewhere when the lyft ETA said I would get there. At the very least, give me a realistic ETA range when I’m looking to order the lyft line. It makes me really hate this otherwise good app."
1271,smcard,"April 10, 2018",5,Payment issue My husband uses lyft to go to work at 5am most mornings. We had an issue yesterday where it nearly tripled the miles and charged my account $48 instead of $13 that it usual is. Long story short couldn’t use lyft this morning because it was asking me to confirm that payment which I refused. Contacted the support and within hours the charge was removed and I have a free ride now. Mistakes happens it’s how the company handles it that keeps the customers.
1272,Richard042114,"July 19, 2018",1,"Thieves I’ve ridden with this company 3 times the past week. I check my bank account and see 6 different charges for different amounts. They took money from my account outside of the rides received. So I email them with proof, including screenshots of my bank app that showed several debits from them as well as screenshots of only 3 rides. They denied they took the money when my bank app and bank representative both clearly proved they did. I disputed ALL of the charges charged by Lyft and got ALL my money back. Don’t give your credit card or bank info to these people. They take money from you when they please and deny doing so, even with proof. They thought I wouldn’t notice. Steer clear."
1273,Duncan Mowatt,"July 25, 2018",3,I love lyft but line is awful. First gotta say that lyft is the best rideshare app out there from a ethics standpoint and I will always use them vs Uber. 
1274,Tarakelly,"July 29, 2018",3,"Used to love it- feeling like I’m being neglected now Lyft was absolutely my first choice to get all around Brooklyn. About two months ago it started having drivers in the wrong spot not picking me up, then they wouldn’t cancel, I got charged for the ride and it never showed up in places I’m at all the time. Recently I’ve had drivers complain to me via text that they’ve traveled a long way to get me and why am I not there when they’ve taken more than 20 minutes over the estimated time that they said they were going to be there. They blame it on the app."
1275,mickaelsonnnn,"September 5, 2018",2,"Estimated time and route not accurate I called a lyft pool to airport. It was showing I would be share the ride with another person, which was on the way. When I got in it was picking up and dropping off other ppl non stop, only driving around the city. I understand it was a pool and I would be joined by other people. But shouldn’t it be more accurate about estimated time? You can’t joke around with ppl going to catch a plane, saying 0.5 hour but actually even more than one hour. It needs to think about the first rider. If you are going to travel for a long distance it doesn’t mean you must share with 10 ppl!"
1276,sunday chef,"January 10, 2020",1,Nothing was send to me that my ride was scheduled Uploaded the app and set up account. I scheduled a ride for the next day to the airport and did not receive any email or text nor anything in the app that confirmed my scheduled ride. I soon found another way to the airport so I went to cancel my ride but I couldn’t find a way to cancel. I thought maybe the request didn’t go through since I hadn’t confirmed my email address before I set up the ride. I received a text the next morning saying my ride was going to pick me up at the scheduled time. I was able to cancel it before the pick up but it appears the total amount of the charge was not refunded. What a sham! Uber it!
1277,queasybee,"December 12, 2019",5,"18% Tip Minimum? Why don’t you pay your drivers better? App suggests a tip after a ride, which is nice. But the options are 18, 20, 25%, which is ridiculous. (You can pick “other amount” but even that’s weird as they require dollars only, no change.) "
1278,Al_s_m,"October 26, 2019",4,Some drivers are just better I have to say that overall Lyft is great. 
1279,The Original Hawaiifornia,"September 20, 2019",5,"Love it, but... In my opinion, the only thing wrong with this app is the ETA it gives before I confirm the order.  I hate that there is a significant difference in ETA between before I place the order, and after I place the order - sometimes it’s a much of a difference as 30 mins.  I think it would be great if passengers were given the ability to order rides based on their arrive-by time, then give the driver’s ETA based on the travel time."
1280,Gamblingt,"April 4, 2019",3,"Safer options There should be a way to see how long a person has been driving and how many drives they’ve done. After confirming a Lyft other than contacting them through calling their phone, a chat option should be available. Just in case they forget where you said would be standing or sitting. Also sharing your ride, how long it will be, pickup/drop off location and who the driver is with car description and license plate should be a thing. Being able to call 911 through the app would be helpful in emergencies"
1281,This is a unprofessional app,"April 5, 2019",5,So Convenient I am new to this due to the fact that i always had my own vehicle. You never realize how much you rely on being able to drive until you can't. This company has made the whole experience a pure pleasure. The app is very user friendly and has the communication with your assigned ride an ease to contact. Great drivers makes for a great company and the guidelines that Lyft adhere to are professionally focused which shows. Thank you.
1282,my4always,"April 22, 2019",2,"Lost a customer Customer service is a joke for starters... I spent so much money with lyft and it was convenient for my son to pick his sister up from after school... here comes the harassment about my sons age (17) and never had any issues till recently some of the drivers would question his age and refused to transport him!! One stated he was under the age of 17, then weeks later another stated hes under the age of 18!! To call customer service and ask and complain of the professionalism and guidelines, the lady kept telling me he’s considered 17 and under!!!

All of my drivers have been pleasant and has made the experience a very good one. My driver this afternoon (Gwendolyn) was friendly and made my ride home an awesome enjoyable surprise. I chose to hand her a gratuity tip rather than pay through your app. Not sure how many more rides I will hire Lyft for but I will definitely recommend your services to friends and/or family. Thank you! 🙂
1284,BDNFLNZ,"May 29, 2019",4,"Confirmations Directly after scheduling a scheduled ride with Lyft, Lyft should confirm that ride with the customer directly after he or she schedules it. ie: Thank you for scheduling your ride with Lyft. We have your requested ride scheduled for tomorrow at 12:00. It’s like someone asks you a question and you say nothing. You don’t know if they even heard you. In my case nothing was confirmed back to me until approx 60 min prior to my requested ride resulting in a double booking. Confirm me the moment you received my request and have seized my funds !"

The notifications of when the driver is coming and the ability to track the car’s location in real time are phenomenal features.

You call the Lyft and it shows oops something went wrong. Then it proceeds to continue to look for nearest driver. It does this for a couple minutes until it finally shows up with oops something went wrong again. Out of frustration, I switch to Uber and order a ride and within a few minutes I’ll get a text saying my Lyft driver is here. I have. Wrong visibility as to who my driver is or where they are. This is ridiculous and hope this gets fixed. Lyft will start losing customers if this continues to happen."
1292,KuramaKitty,"February 25, 2018",2,It’s okay but let’s talk about how waiting 10 minuets for your ride. First of all the app is okay it’s just whenever it’s early in the morning that I get this problem. I’ve never had this happen quite often but it’s becoming a issue. I get drivers that are so far away and my destination isn’t even that far I would say it’s 7 minuets away. I get ones that are in Downtown LA or even Burbank and I have to wait like about 8-15 minuets for my driver? Like what’s that all about? I use to wait 2-4 minuets super early in the mornings and now I don’t. Please fix this! I arrived late to work because of how long I had to wait for my ride to come.
1293,The Battalion Couch,"October 15, 2018",1,"Lyft Shared Ride kept me waiting 30 minutes On 10/15 at 2:40pm I ordered a lyft shared ride and the app told me my car would be there in 7 minutes. For the next 30 minutes, I watched my driver via the app drive past my pickup location in Sodo to West Seattle, Georgetown, etc, consistently updating my estimated time of pick-up to within the next 7 to 10 minutes. I tried calling the driver twice, no answer. I was stranded in the middle of nowhere, 7 months pregnant. There is no customer service to call or contact and see in real time what’s going on. Constantly updating pickup times so that it’s under 15 minutes while the driver is clearly being assigned multiple new trips is DISHONEST."
1294,JincyB,"October 22, 2018",4,Only one problem This app is amazingly easy to use and impressively efficient. I love the way that you can communicate with your driver and that they count down exactly how many minutes away he is. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that the GPS does not accurately pinpoint your current location. I used it twice today and each time it said my starting location was an entirely different address. I had to erase it and retype my correct location.

They always find me smoothly and even living in a town home where a unit number is required, they still find me at the fastest pace. Thank you Lyft! I will ALWAYS choose you first!"

I couldn’t get a ride or in contact with anyone. It kept saying “payment method not available”. My phone was about to die. Had to go back into the airport to plug it in. I downloaded the Lyft app and had a ride there within 5 min. The driver was great. The Uber customers??? — Probably still waiting at the airport.
1302,Lilhomieace26,"November 21, 2019",3,Time I use this app almost every day.  Before I used to love it but now there are times I get completely frustrated with it. The app is always giving me drivers that are almost 20 minutes away and it always makes me late for the destination I am going to. This is just ridiculous when you open the app it shows all the cars that are close by and when you request your ride they give you one 15 minutes away. They need to fix this. Other than that it’s a great app and the drivers are wonderful people.
1303,FixThisHorridFrameRate,"October 23, 2019",4,"Great- but could be better I think this app is great because it’s reliable, and works well. I think my only complaint is you can’t ask to be picked up at a certain time. You just have to order the lyft when you’re ready, and hope the driver can be there sooner then later. That makes things difficult if you’re trying to get to work on time, but overall.a good app and service. I’ve used it in both the US and Canada, and always had a great experience."
1304,Zeta Sigma 1036,"September 27, 2019",5,Liars and cheats Don’t drive for Lyft. Drive for Uber. Lyft will not honor their word on sign on bonuses and I was lied to by employees. You can’t even call to talk to anyone from the company by phone. They rarely respond to inquiries to messages sent through their help form and their Facebook page won’t help you if you’ve already put in an inquiry. Uber has always gone out of their way to make sure their drivers are taken care of. Lyft is a bunch of liars and cheats.
1305,Ze007,"August 14, 2019",4,"Always inaccurate as to driver arrival Not once in all my rides with Lyft has the time for the car to arrive been correct. In the mornings if I need to use it to go to work, the app says the car is 3-4 minutes  always, but that usually translates into 10-15. I can see where the driver is to my home is farther than a few minutes, but none the less. It’s not traffic, often there is none, but inaccurate information information. Otherwise does what it should"
1306,CReinhart,"July 21, 2019",5,Maps A ride share app is only as good as its location data. Lyft regularly sends my driver a block or two away from where I am.

1309,Madison is Great,"June 19, 2019",4,A Couple Suggestions The app works great as most feedback already suggests. A couple suggestions I have are: 
1310,MMosher04,"September 4, 2018",1,"Impossible to Tell Impossible to tell if I even have a ride coming. I requested over 30 minutes ago, from what I gather the ride said it be here in 12 minutes. It’s been 50. No email confirmation, no phone or text confirmation, yet my bank account was charged immediately. How can you charge me for a service that I am not even receiving. I would pay if I actually had my ride. This is the second time I’ve tried using Lyft and this is the second failure. I push the request ride button, it finds a driver in the area, then goes back to set up ride. Horrible app, horrible experience, lost out on 2 days of work because this is poorly constructed."
1311,littlemiss1963,"September 6, 2018",5,LYFT IS SUPERIOR LYFT is the superior ride share option. It is obvious they have a pro-active and positive work culture from the top down with both customers and employees in mind as their priority. 
1312,CaptHatch,"September 7, 2018",5,"Convenient & easy to use Downloaded the Lyft app to use in getting around downtown Atlanta for the weekend.  The app was easy to use: registering was easy, scheduling rides was easy, everything was super smooth.  All my drivers arrived exactly when scheduled and were friendly & knowledgeable about the area.  Fees were very reasonable: about $7-8 per ride. This was my first time using a ride share app & I was very pleased with the results.  Highly recommend it."
1313,Katherine Rockingham,"September 16, 2018",4,Lyft Review I am a first time user today. Received a referral from family and to have $5 off first ride. CONS:The cost was the same as someone else who uses Lyft from the same location going to the same area. Cost was raised and “ slashed” .Ride should have been around $3. This is False advertisement to get more customers. PROS: Very quick to locate a driver. Driver was punctual . No problems during transport .I appreciate the text updates and driver license plates and photo ID of the driver. Can be a bit expensive even for short distances.
1314,Catieecakess,"October 25, 2018",1,"Needs to be better This app is going to be going out of business soon. You guys have so many people on this app that do not even speak English, some of your driver’s cars either smell like a brewery or a marijuana dispensary, or your drivers don’t know where they are going at all. I’ve literally almost gotten in near death car accidents simply because the driver doesn’t understand what I’m saying. You all should really develop some kind of feature that lets the person pick whether or not they want a bilingual driver or not or if they want their driver to speak or not because this is getting very annoying. Fix the language barrier or I’m never using this again."
1315,Dlewis7375,"November 13, 2018",5,"Safety I ride with Lyft because I feel a sense of safety, they have not failed me yet.

Tip for service! "
1316,beelzebubby7,"November 20, 2018",1,"Frustrating I hate only a few things more than I hate lyft. Drivers have cancelled on me after wasting my time waiting on their arrival, and it’s near impossible to get a driver to pick you up in downtown Seattle. They’ll accept your ride on the app and never arrive. For which you are not charged, but again, my time matters."

I went to look up how to schedule in the help section and I was doing it right. My daughter tried it and realized that you cannot schedule Lyft XL, your help section should have stated that. We were going to the airport and had a lot of bags. I do not like that I cannot talk to a person. Drivers have told me they were having problems with the ap. I am in my 50’s and I like to be able to speak to a person in customer service. Ap’s are only as good as the person that created it and people are not perfect."

What used to be $3 is now $6, even without a surge. They went from a company invested in the personal growth of the driver and experience of the passenger, to one that has even higher prices than uber. Its a shame because while I used to use lyft without a single doubt, now I check for other alternatives to get to my destinations."

Aside from a canned robotic reply that stated Lyft will appropriately deal with the driver and make sure he doesn’t pick me up again, the company has done nothing to right the wrong that occurred. I have not heard back, they have not reached out to let me know how they will rectify the problem they caused."
1322,McRoth,"June 21, 2018",5,New arrival time display confusing A recent update to the app made the arrival time at destination more prominently displayed than pickup time. This caused confusion (and panic) because it led me to think it would take 30 minutes for my ride to pick me up. Please switch the emphasis or make it more clear. When I request a ride my primary consideration is when will driver pick me up. I generally already know how long it will take to get where I'm going.

We are very happy with the drivers that we have encountered with Lyft!"
1324,hbf420,"August 24, 2018",5,complaint I’m super upset. I got a lyft pool to go to downtown....the app took me to the aventura mall to pick up someone... that was totally out of my way. I’m wondering what’s the criteria to share a ride with someone. How far can the drive go ? When I requested it was saying that my drop off time would be 8:42...I got at my destination at 8:50 because the driver cancelled the other ride. I wish the app gets fixed and we only pick up people in our route. Thank you.
1325,Felcitee,"March 9, 2020",5,TAKES DRIVER SIDE ALWAYS. I ordered a Lyft for a customer at an establishment I work for and apparently she “urinated” in the vehicle that was 1.86 mile drive after coming from a restaurant. I got charged $100 for what looked like water and not even being the passenger. I would just stick to Uber. I deleted the app and never plan to use it again. I truly believe this was a case of discrimination considering the passenger was an elderly African American woman and y’all can assume the driver with his nascar dodge.

However, now that I’ve been using it, I’ve truly enjoyed the peace of mind it gives me. I get door-to-door service, I don’t have to worry about parking, and drinking and driving is never a worry. I’ve been lucky to have consistently had pleasant drivers that were polite and helpful. "
1327,Ji99y,"February 5, 2020",1,Horrible customer service I’m 17 and need rides to work and college almost every day. There is a rule that you have to be at least 18 to ride alone in a Lyft but this was stated nowhere when signing up or linking my email to my account (that has me listed as 17) . I wait 12 mins for my Lyft to arrive and as soon as I sit in the seat I’m asked if I’m 18 . Thinking nothing of it I said no and she explained that I could not ride alone . I was kicked out and forced to cancel the ride and pay a the $5 cancellation fee and when I tried to get my refund they said it wasn’t refundable . Very poor service everything was automated and wouldn’t pay attention to my particular vulnerable situation .
1328,pjrbikeguy,"January 17, 2020",1,"Where is you so called service Lyft. Companies that hide behind technology are the very worst examples of human beings on the planet. Period.  I have been a long time customer and supporter of Lyft until today.  I had several rides I had to cancel because drivers were all 20 plus minutes away.  Was I in the middle of nowhere?  No. I was in Los Angeles, near a metro train stop.  One driver even called me claiming no internet service so he couldn't cancel the ride.  Total BS.  How can he accept rides if no service??But of course there is no way to complain to Lyft because they don't give you a method to reach them live.  Total cowardice and shouldn't be able to call themself a serious business."
1329,spend your own money,"January 6, 2020",5,"Custom Tip not so custom Lyft has changed our ability to use anything other than increments of dollars for tipping. I find it irritating that one cannot tip 15% on a $10 ride. To be pushed towards rounding up vs rounding down is a poor use of an optional feature. I’m more bad at Lyft than the driver, but it is the driver that may suffer. Or benefit. Who knows? Depends on the mood. I’d rather do cash at that point. Or maybe lift should just pay drivers fairly."
1330,mikeyy kaz,"January 2, 2020",1,"You can be charged DOUBLE without being notified If you select a fare the price can DOUBLE in the time that it takes you to select a pick up location. You will not be notified of the change in price and have no way of knowing the price is changing until the end of your ride when you are billed. And when you try to talk to customer service they will do nothing for you and stop replying to your requests. The company will refuse to admit any flaws and will not do the bare minimum to take care of customers who they have wronged. Do yourself a favor and use a better ride share program, one that takes customer satisfaction seriously."
1331,Michael from the suh dude,"November 15, 2019",1,"Bad algorithms, bad drivers Algorithm gives you an incredibly “generous” ETA at first, which proceeds to become more and more delayed. As for the drivers, far more than Uber drivers, they’ll cancel on you within 20 seconds if you’re not already outside. No call at all, no “hey I’m outside” message like Uber drivers give you, just straight canceling, forcing you to wait for another driver. If this had happened just once, I’d leave it up to just one uncourteous driver, but no this has happened easily on 5+ occasions. I only recently switched from Uber because of the Delta Airlines promotion they had, but I’m switching back to Uber immediately. It was a awful run, and a waste of time"

However, now that I need a reliable ride to work I’m frustrated and disappointed with Lyft’s service. The estimated arrival times are always much longer than predicted (says 4 minutes, takes 20), and the drivers switch 2 or 3 times - and not always for someone closer to me. I live 3 miles from downtown LA, not someplace remote. I’m sure there’s morning demand, but on more than one occasion I’ve waited the estimated time for the car only to have the car/driver bail at the last minute and be replaced with another 20 minute wait."

I am very unhappy about this. And I can’t reach anyone over phone to settle this, besides email and all they keep telling me is I was only charged for the ride once...

It’s hard to plan trips when you don’t know if your ride will be on time or not. And this has been happening more and more recently. They used to be good so I don’t know what happening. Also there’s been a bug for a few weeks now where the car on the map does not move and the time does not go down when the driver is actually moving. Please fix this.

1348,ischysia,"June 27, 2019",5,"Handicapped Options You guys should update your app to where you can let the driver know if you are on crutches or need a wheelchair because recently my mother used Lyft to get around and she paid the ride fee and had to uncomfortably sit in the backseat of a small car while she held her crutches next to her. Also, the app should let the passenger choose whether they want a female or male driver. This would make the app ten times better! Think about it."

But last weekend lyft charged me a 10 dollar cancellation fee for a ride that was 6.49 dollar. Like wth???? When i tried to tell my side of the story because i felt wrongly charged i couldn’t get in contact with anyone and the app made me fill out a form where they deemed that i was rightfully charged. So if a driver says that I’m not outside when i am it doesn’t matter because they are always right huh? I truly felt scammed out of my money and because of that i deleted my lyft account and app and will never take lyft again. I’d rather stick with Uber because at least they actually listen to my claims.

I use lyft every time over uber so that I can accrue frequent flyer miles on my delta account, however the cars always take longer to come than estimated, I am often paired with other riders who are getting dropped off in the opposite direction, and I am ALWAYS dropped off significantly later than the estimated time. Overall I am very frustrated with lyft and while I always get from point A to point B it is never a pleasant experience as I am always late. Also lyft takes longer to pair you and have a car come than uber so they should work on getting more drivers."

I would have taken the bus. Please, Don’t waste my time like this! The only reason I’m using your service is to decrease my commute time to an appointment or work or wherever, not to wait over 20min for a new driver that is “closer” to me.

Lyft is inattentive to its users and does not care if something stressful or scary happens to you during your ride. They see the bad reviews and cover them up just as they seem to do on Apple. It’s ridiculous and I can tell you for sure this isn’t a 5 star service it’s bottom of the barrel. Try Uber, stay away from this."

My opinion and stand firm by it what if it was them, or their daughter or mother for Gods Sake! Haven’t used you guys in years I guess I see now why.. prices to high and drivers afraid of riders.

This was my first time ever using a ride service, and I had thoughts that it would be uncomfortable and weird riding with someone I didn’t know, but Brett kept up with my conversation and I felt comfortable. Thanks guys, I’ll be using this app again"
1380,CEThomas101,"November 17, 2017",5,"Needs a lot of improvement For my elderly parents this app is very hard to use. It should have a way to store various addresses so that it can be easily entered.  My father comes and goes to the same place each time, unfortunately there is no way to enter more than one scheduled driver.  Three days a week at the same time twice a day and yet there is no way to schedule that.  For some with slight dementia it’s hard to remember what to do."
1381,LondonLassie,"July 17, 2018",5,"Such a wonderful deal ! What I love about Lyft is they are here when you need them. We use it quite a bit for our entertainment dates and our dinner dates when we want to have a few drinks . No worries about getting home, very reasonably priced, though one time it was a bit pricey due to demand...... but still cheaper than a taxi and far more convenient and reliable. All of our drivers have been delightful and considerate. Thank you!"
1382,pikasof,"July 23, 2018",3,"Serious drop in route algorithm quality I loved lift. Loved. I prefer it to Uber and taxi etc, but ever since I started using Lyft almost 5 years ago, the way they make it inconvenient to entice you to take their pricier option is obnoxious. For a route that should take 20 min, add 10 minutes bc driver is coming from 2+ mi away, another 5 min because a passenger was added, and another 10mins bc said passenger’s route is clearly out of the way. For a 3-4$ service that is supposed to be fast, I might as well have taken public transportation bc it’s 30-40 mins straight."
1383,JenaeS,"July 29, 2018",1,"Read this!!! I appreciate the service Lyft but some of the drivers are mean nasty rude ignorant people, as a paying customer who works hard for money I demand to be treated with respect. Not only am I paying customer but I am always waiting outside early for my Lyft driver, only for the driver to ride past me two or three times before picking me up or not picking me up at my pickup spot but across the street down the street but not where I am same thing with my drop off I can never be dropped off at my destination foolishness. Lyft has credited my account a few times and for that I am grateful but in all honesty I feel like the more I leave a bad review the worst my drivers get how is that fair"
1384,idiolect,"July 30, 2018",5,"Nice alternative to Uber, but sloppy drivers Service is mostly fine. In Brooklyn and Queens, at least, it has been impossible lately to get a driver to pick you up at the address you provided or the suggested address Lyft offers. I’m tired of having to cross traffic and walk a block or more, often with packages, to meet some driver who can’t be bothered to pull over at a clear location. If you don’t mind that hassle, the service is ok."
1385,pick up time error,"October 9, 2018",5,Error on pick up time I rated it 2 starts because it shows you can schedule a pick up time you schedule and it sends driver immediately. I tried 2x and same error I had to cancel my ride twice and on top of that I was charged a cancellation fee. Also tried a third time Lyft app said pick up time 345 but driver was on my house in 3 min??? This is so confusing to top that off you can’t speak to a customer service representative???
1386,lgbbygurl,"February 28, 2020",2,Cancelling So I take Lyft almost everyday to and from work and ive never had a big problem until today i ordered a ride and it would take the driver 15 minutes to reach me because he was finishing another ride so I decide to go on uber and see if their charge was similar w a shorter wait time which it was when i went to cancel my lyft i wasn't allowed because the driver had apparently been driving 3 minutes to me already which is a LIE! The driver was driving to their first stop still not towards me I should’ve been able to cancel the ride without getting charge $5 for it!

1388,breakabone12345,"January 11, 2020",4,"Price and route I live 1 mile from MacAthur BART station.  When requesting a ride the app quotes a price based on going about 3 miles ($9.66) because it chooses to send the driver on a roundabout way using the freeway.  When instructing the driver to take the straight shot way on 40th Ave, w hi chi again is 1 mile, I am still charged $9.66!!! SMH...this just be one of those rides where the driver gets screwed by Lyft and Lyft pockets the difference.   Now that Uber has changed their policy it may be time for this “only Lyft-we” to think about switching"

We decided to try Lyft to go in and out of the city to see a show at the theater and it was an excellent experience. The app is easy to use the drivers ,were lovely ,they were on time ,they drove well ,and were friendly and pleasant and I was particularly happy that they were women for a change. "
1390,1088402PO3,"February 13, 2019",4,New to Lyft I’m new to the app and the lyft experiences all together so this would be a premature review. The app wasn’t as clear as it could be considering the price changes min by min sometimes. The first time I booked it was late because I didn’t press “confirm pick up” which I thought meant confirm you’ve been picked up. I took a chance on pressing it which is how I found out. My ride would have never came had I not took a chance. I’m still learning and will change my review if necessary.

1393,Hrald Junior,"April 2, 2019",5,Heralds Review Thank You Lyft for your great service. I am mobility restricted and appreciate your pick up service at the end of my driveway. Your drivers are friendly and polite and allow me access to the front seat to make my entering and exiting the vehicles so much easier for me. Your prices are the most reasonable and that helps since I no longer drive. Thank You again for all your services do to make life that much easier.
1394,A2-Susan,"May 9, 2019",3,"App is Very Glitchy I’ve always had pretty good service with the app.  Today however, it was super glitchy.  It gave a slightly wrong pickup point, so I tried to change it.  It gave me the option to change, but when I went to see if it changed, it hadn’t.  Then it gave me another driver.  Again the wrong pick up point, and tried again to change to no avail, so I just cancelled it.  Then I finally got my third driver, and I was able to enter the exact address, and all went well.  Felt like a circus animal in using this app today."
1395,Pureskrilla,"July 31, 2019",5,"Sometimes great, sometimes not so great. I have noticed that, especially at airports, it will initially show drivers being with 2-3 minutes only to have my trip picked up by someone 10-15 minutes away. Highly frustrating. Also- not all of the drivers have toll access, which does not make sense. My trip took an extra hour beyond what was originally quoted. This makes it almost unreliable."
1396,Scott8877456,"July 28, 2019",4,"No-show driver scam? Lyft app said driver for my latest ride had arrived but driver’s location showed on a different street. I tried to call the driver, but my call went directly to voicemail and the mailbox was full, so I couldn’t even leave a message. Driver left after 5 minutes and I had to pay $8 to cancel the ride so I could request another. Feeling scammed and will protest as soon as I figure out how. "
1397,bayareamoneycounty415,"June 24, 2019",2,"Why?? I ordered a lyft to get to work but then it was requesting it for like 7 minutes & the driver never accepted the rides. So then I cancel the ride to just get a ride from my friend & on my way to work I look down & it says “Jonathan is 2 minutes away.” When i clearly remember cancelling the ride. I hit cancel, it said it was cancelled. So i don’t understand why after that there was finally a driver on his way. Please fix this. I had to pay a 5$ fee because i never noticed that a driver was on his way. It’s really stupid that i cancel the ride but then I suppose drivers still see that I’m I HAD requested a ride."

I used to Taxis a lot. I do not mean any disrespect toward Taxi Drivers but I always felt like I was taking precious time away from Taxi Drivers; I waited in secluded, exclusive areas in San Francisco and Taxi would be no show; I waited in the rain; I waited when I had emergencies; I was treated based on how far I was going. Lyft, Lyft is on it!"
1399,NatashaMcF,"June 16, 2019",5,"Uber versus Lyft I do not usually write reviews online but I feel like this one is necessary. I have been helping my mom from a different state for a few months and had been using Uber for her transportation. She recently moved closer and as I put in her new address for pick up, I was notified that Uber “is not available” in my area. Thank you for expanding your maps and allowing pick ups in rural areas. I will use Lyft exclusively from now 🌸"

You know this stuff happens. I also wasn’t notified about the fee until this am, when the ride occurred last night which means had I completed the tip last night, it would have been without full information which is just wrong. Why would i tip the guy if he is already receiving an excessive lost and found charge?"
1401,AustinVegas88,"March 26, 2018",2,Fix payment configuration options The app is fine for intended us. My issue is the latest version (as of this review) still doesn’t provide payment option config and flexibility.  Meaning I can’t delete a payment method once I’ve added it to the app.  I have a now canceled card still in my payment area that LYFT continues to try and validate w their $1.00 fee charge method and it’s denied every time (because th card is canceled).  Stop trying to validate a dead card and give me the option to delete this card from my payment methods area.  Otherwise the app is good.   I’ll update my review once this is resolved.
1402,HappyNotEstatic,"July 20, 2018",5,"Nothing short of Great Since I have been in Las Vegas working, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences ride sharing with Lyft. Prices are lower than the competition prices. No names there..Great drivers and courteous. Excellent alternative to the bus or other options. Also the option to share a ride with another patron is awesome because it also lowers the cost. Time limits aside, that’s what I usually choose and has worked out great thus far."
1403,Scoot2125,"August 22, 2018",5,Something is wrong with your maps. Your maps had me 2 blocks from where I actually was. The driver called me and I told him where I was and I have no clue why it’s said I was at the location he pulled up to. I tried calling him cause once again he went to the wrong place and wouldn’t answer his phone. I called 3 more times and nothing. I texted him the address and he never responded then canceled on me. Now I am late for work.
1404,forever40,"August 25, 2018",5,Very Professional and on time It was my first Lyft ride so I have no comparisons but the driver was on time and made me feel comfortable with light conversation. The vehicle was clean and the drive was smooth. I got updates of my scheduled ride and when it would arrive as well as a picture of my driver and his vehicle which helped me spot him right away. The whole process of requesting my ride and payment was super easy! I will use this service again!

It seems my assigned drivers are often far away. Other passengers come and go and I’ve been stuck now multiple occasions way way  past the estimated pick up time. It always shows 7 minute, 3 minutes, 6 minutes, etc while taking 40 minutes, 25 minutes, etc and I’ve had no recourse or anyone to talk to. Guys, this is at all times of day in various cities and locations. Please improve your pick up times and driver/passenger assignments."
1407,EngelEliz,"December 18, 2018",1,"Hacked. Christmas cancelled. I chose Lyft because I have had many convos with Uber users who got their card info compromised, discovering $300+ rides charged that never happened. Their bank accounts drained until the fraud claim was completed at their bank. Well this morning at the grocery store we were declined. We then saw that overnight a number of $200+ Lyft charges had drained our bank account. Looking at my ride history, none listed were ever above $50. I am a discriminating online shopper and rarely use my card for purchases. I suppose that the only way I will ever use a ride app again is if a prepaid card is involved. We can’t get gas or food or gifts now."
1408,enzo414,"January 4, 2019",4,"Wait Times There can be some long periods of times that the closest driver is no shorter then 18 minutes away in normally high presence areas. It also seems during those periods, the drivers will accept you in their cue but either don’t move from where they are or drive away from you instead of just denying you and you end up waiting even longer. Otherwise, when this is not happening, I am extremely happy with Lyft and prefer it over Uber."

I live one exit away from work and am now at the point where calling I have to call for a ride one hour in advance and still can’t rely on a ride. Scheduling in advance literally makes it worse. You also can’t cancel your REQUEST and have to wait 15 minutes at a time to try somewhere else or get charged a huge no show fee. I work at a medical facility that needs me here on time and this service has become totally in reliable.   Don’t be fooled by great reviews. All of them are from drivers trying to promote themselves. 🤬
1413,Don in Wakefield,"February 18, 2020",2,"Short notice! After scheduling my ride 2 days in advance, I got a text 5 MINUTES BEFORE PICKUP that the ride was canceled due to a question of the credit card I had on file!! There was no indication what the problem was, as I re-entered the same info and it was accepted. We were able to get another ride, but such short notice could have put us in danger of missing our flight. Lyft should have notified me of the problem way before the scheduled ride, like when I first booked it. Also, I could find no phone number on the app to call and ask what was wrong. Poor management!!"

The app had a quick and easy way to connect with the driver to get it back. The one thing I wish the app allowed is to give you a driver contact once you have scheduled a ride and a driver picks it up. I have had a few occasions where I’ve had a secured driver of a scheduled trip drop it minutes before the scheduled pick up, leaving me hanging at the last minute."

At this point I see NO REASON to put up with Uber’s constantly changing policies (all designed to squeeze out one last dollar). And for who?  The drivers aren’t well paid. On one evening Uber cancelled my ride 4 times in a row, charging me $5 for each cancellation. That’s an extra $20 in fees and I never ever got a car!  Forget Uber. Just use Lyft."

1424,Kyle m27,"April 30, 2019",2,"We've found you a closer driver For the record I typically have no problems with Lyft. However ever since they updated the driver matching algorithm, which I think was introduced around the new UI overhaul, I get stuck in driver swapping purgatory. I'll start with a driver who's ten minutes away when they're five minutes it will swap to someone who's 7 minutes away. This will happen 2-4 times during some rides. The kicker is this typically happens during prime time so if I cancel I'll get charged more and typically get charged a five dollar fee. It's interactions like this that are forcing me to use Uber again."

The drivers consistently make you walk to them even though the point of the GPS system used to track your location should come and pick you up where you are. Avoid these apps and just get a car or take a regular green taxi. They don’t care about the customers, just taking your money."

If a customer will be longer than 3 minutes they NEED to order another lyft! There needs to be an option where there is a countdown/timer just like a pickup! This would cut down on wait time for other passengers wanting rides because drivers are not spending 20 min waiting for someone at mcdonalds like i did because it said i could not cancel or i wouldnt get paid!

Now there are no drivers closer than 20 minutes away and they can’t seem to follow the gps. Getting lost multiple times and making me late for work.

1431,amappy,"March 30, 2018",1,"Zero Care for Customers I would advise anyone looking for a safe ride service look elsewhere. Lyft takes ZERO responsibility for the actions of their drivers, including but not limited to unsafe driving, mindless driving (not paying attention to the GPS making rides take twice as long), and stealing property. I quit using Lyft over a year ago after I felt very unsafe with one of their drivers who I did not feel was in a state of mind to be driving. Instead of investigating this issue, they simply unmatched me to the driver...allowing him to go on and drive others disregarding my concerns.

Rides end up starting roughly 2 blocks ahead of your pick up location and 2 blocks after your drop off location. This inaccuracy combined with surge pricing, you end up paying $11 for a ride advertised as $6 when you hailed the ride. I have been using Lyft 1-2 times everyday, for over a year. If I was living with this inaccuracy all along, I have been ripped-off big time. I have emailed customer service 2 business days ago, no response yet.

They have absolutely no phone number you can call. Instead, they force you to submit an inefficient Support ticket which will get no follow-up to you the customer and which requires you to spend several minutes on their reCAPTCHA before you can even submit the ticket. You can only send driver one message total and can’t edit it, and that has to be done through the app so hopefully you have a tablet. I finally used Find My iPhone and the driver brought it back to me. "

If a driver had been assigned in the next two minutes, they would almost certainly have arrived after the pickup window AND I would have been unable to cancel because you cannot cancel scheduled rides once they have been assigned, which I assume applies even if they are egregiously late (didn’t want to find out the hard way)."

I travel the same course everyday and everyday my trip fare changed and it continued to increased. The same trip in uber is way cheaper. I try my best not to use Lyft because to me it’s a scam.

Got into the vehicle and she immediately cancels because she doesn’t want to drive me to the airport and the app doesn’t tell drivers where passengers are going when they accept. This is absolutely ridiculous and now I have to wait another 20 minutes who hopefully won’t cancel on me. I may miss my flight completely because of this.

It was $200/ for X amount of rides as long as they were under $15 dollars. My bill for Lyft is more than a car payment and hardly any rides are over fifteen unless it's a two trip.. Please offer this to your loyal daily customers because we're the ones that are keeping your company going. And trying to stick without the hassle of calling Uber. Thank you
1506,mariascut,"July 31, 2018",5,"Where is home/work change address Lyft are you for real ? Where is the option to change home/work address? People are using this app and have to google how to change home /work address? Most ridiculous thing ever ! Why there no profile option where u can actually store your most used destinations etc ? From this point of view Uber is a 5 and you, ohhh well 1. Work on it!"
1507,NotDamaris,"August 2, 2018",5,"Better than Uber! I have been a Lyft rider since Lyft first came to the scene and it gets better and better every year! I use to have both Uber and Lyft on my phone, but I deleted Uber and kept Lyft because Uber is terrible. They do not do background checks on their drivers! How can a company do extensive like Uber not do background checks on their drivers!? Anyways, Lyft is amazing and I wish more people knew about it! Please Lyft, invest more on publications!"
1508,Cedargreentree,"August 19, 2018",5,Car View Map The app is easy to use and keeps me informed. I especially like seeing my driver’s route to pick me up—eliminates any concern about “Do they know I’m here?”
1509,ghdyhn,"August 22, 2018",4,"Great....but... Ive been really happy with Lyft this trip Yo the city! The drivers are great! Safe and friendly! However, twice in the last two days I’ve been charged five dollars without actually getting ride. Once, driver couldn’t find me and didn’t answer when I called. Then today the locator was way off and driver was about four miles from where I actually was. I called and he told me to cancel. I did and was charged five bucks again!! The fare was less than the charge! 😔"
1510,Phillytf,"September 20, 2017",5,"So far so horrible!! Plain and simple the Lyft I’m requesting does nothing but give me a weird sound that ultimately means no. I’ve deleted the app, I’ve logged out, my iPhone has the most recent update, and yet I can’t get a freaking ride. I’m not sure why this is happening and I’ve reached out to their slow non-responsive email support team with no resolve. I’m stuck b/c I refuse to use uber and can’t get to where I need to go. Thanks for nothing Lyft🤦🏽‍♂️"
1511,Adelez,"September 21, 2017",5,Every ride has had great vibes! I love Oscar. You'll definitely have a great ride if he picks you up. He is so nice. I'm under the impression Lyft takes care of their drivers in regards to respecting them and paying them decently well. Because so far everyone I have ridden with has been really great. Everyone takes care of their cars and has waters and is just really polite and engage in great conversations. These are of course just my experiences. Two 👍🏽👍🏽
1512,iceicejick,"October 19, 2017",5,"Great App! Lyft works just the way I want, providing rides that are fast and friendly. The app is way simpler than Uber and is more comforting. I will definitely be using Lyft more. The drivers tend to be nicer and I have had consistently nicer vehicles in a higher level of service. The UI has gotten way better and arrival/destination times are steadily improving. Try to make the destination search more robust, but that’s my only complaint."
1513,Xzgdt,"January 28, 2018",1,"THE WORST CONSISTENTLY THE WORST DRIVERS ON THE ROAD. Why on earth I would let myself call a lyft again is beyond me. Your drivers are clearly not vetted. Some psycho FOR THE SECOND TIME drove us completely away from our destination. and when this guy heard us mumbling in the back seat that his route was awful, he CALLED 911 ON US BECAUSE HE “DIDN’T WANT A BAD RATING”. maybe provide a handbook or something, i don’t think that should be protocol right? holy crap, worst service ever. And this is following an incident about a month ago with a driver who took us to the middle of nowhere and wouldn’t let us escape the vehicle, then reported MY ACCOUNT and getting me suspended after screaming threats at us out the window. HAVE SOME STANDARDS! NYC YELLOW CABS FOREVER!!!"
1514,SinisterMittens,"February 5, 2018",5,"SO FAR SO GOOD Enjoying it so far. Hoping some sort of inventive or credit awarding system can be added based on how much you have used lyft, how much you have spent on lyft, how much have you sent for others to ride free, and possibly a point system ranking on how many reviews and comments/feedback you have giving as many don’t really care about that part once the trip is over with. Thanks for everything"
1515,Mrs. Frustration,"April 29, 2020",3,"Unpredictable and unreliable Before the pandemic shut things down, I had no problems requesting and getting a ride! Now there’s not a lot of drivers and the ones that are out, Lyft keeps adding new riders to their que! Request a Lyft and it will say 18 minutes away and that the driver is finishing a ride near by then when it gets to 8 minutes away, they take that driver from you and look for another one! It’s not fair especially when you are trying to get to work! Sometimes you can’t even get a driver!"

When I set up my ride, Lyft shows four or five cars around me- I’m practically surrounded. It says my driver will be here in two minutes. Then suddenly, all the images of cars disappear, and now someone several miles away is my driver, and will be here in five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen..."

1519,Artseenerd,"December 12, 2019",4,Great Lyft always seems to apply promos often enough to where i want to continue using them. The app never seems to be buggy when i use it and it is easy to navigate. Although i believe adding and removing cards/credit cards should be a bit easier. I have had difficulty in the past. I also love that you can track down previous rides if you’ve left items in the driver’s car! That is definitely beneficial.
1520,FF Ace,"February 22, 2019",1,"Drivers robbed me I was on a diner cruise with my wife, and ordered a lyft as we were tying up to the pier since it was raining. Drivers who were sitting out front waiting for this cruise to end and give rides. First driver canceled immediately, second driver reported me a no show within a couple minutes of receiving the fair. This report charged me money. I had to re-order a lyft, this time the fair was increased in price due to the heavy volume of people now ordering rides."
1521,Madison6080,"March 17, 2019",5,"MY DRIVER WAS WONDERFUL Mohammad was truly a wonderful driver - he went straight to my residence & was extremely polite & interesting to talk to.  After reading so many horrid reviews, I am thrilled with this experience.  I am disabled & he was wonderful about my suitcases & walker.  I would like to request him in the future.  He was delayed with a previous fare plus not having the previously assigned Driver available.  It was worth the wait to be driven by a truly kind & caring Gentlemam."
1522,traveltropical,"March 22, 2019",4,Scheduling a ride I frequently need airport rides at odd hours and want to schedule them ahead of time.   Once scheduled though I cannot find a way to look at it again until the time comes for the driver to arrive.  This makes it difficult to confirm I booked it properly or to change it if something comes up.  Please educate me how to view the scheduled pick up or make the app more intuitive with an easy link to find it again.   Thank you
1523,metrocouncil,"April 8, 2019",5,"Driver going to leave notice,  before customer sees car It makes you worry when the car has not yet arrived and the app says the driver will leave in four minutes, and you haven’t even seen the car or driver yet. I think he arrived on the other side of the street and had to make a U-turn, but the app was saying he’s going to leave that’s a little scary. Otherwise everything was great."
1524,Boxxxxxx,"May 4, 2019",1,"Bad service design, if you let your drivers pick and choose a customer last minute Too many times, drivers choose not to drive me after learning that my destination is not in the popular areas where they can pick up new customers after drop-off. I only live 3 miles / 12 minutes away from Harvard University. After waiting and to be ditched when they get to me and see the destination is insulting and a waste of time. It’s back to Taxi days. If that’s how it is, then there’s no difference between Lyft and Taxi. Today, I saw the car that I was waiting for and they canceled and picked somebody else right in front of me."
1525,RootieW,"December 5, 2019",5,"Mostly terrific.... My motto is “Thank God for Lyft”. Mostly I’m grateful that I can easily get around town, go to work or appointments even though some vision problems in my left eye prevent me from driving. Out of 100s of rides there have been a few negative experiences. The worse was a young Chinese woman who really didn’t speak English, but mostly it’s been timely, very useful, pleasant and often has lead to truly interesting conversations."
1526,Ree Vewer,"November 26, 2019",1,"Terrifying rides I have repeatedly gotten into cars with drivers since I started using Lyft that were more frightening with every ride. Unqualified, surly, angry drivers who drove recklessly or were just generally terrifying, picking up other riders from extremely sketchy neighborhoods who were covered in tattoos, clearly gang members from gang neighborhoods, on the way to a very non-gang area, that’s not my idea of a shared Lyft ride. I have completely lost confidence in this app and in this company to provide a reasonable service to the average rider. My last ride I felt I had taken my own life in my own hands and had no control over what was happening. I will never ride with Lyft again."
1527,ushebdhdj,"November 3, 2019",3,Left at the airport On Friday I waited for my Lyft rode- a black Jeep Cherokee - nothing. I waited and waited and called finally reaching the driver. He had left with out me and checking the app it showed that I was in the vehicle!!  Wrong!  I called the driver again and he claimed to not actually know that I wasn’t there but chose to bill me anyway!!!Worst of all the faulty LYFT APP prevented me from reordering another ride as my initial ride that I was supposedly on was not yet over! ! I ended up having to walk a mile to get a cab and then having to spend lots of time disputing the LYFT charges!!! Horrifying!!!!
1528,Mtlshop,"August 9, 2019",3,"First trip with Lyft. Just signed up with Lyft at airport. Usually use Uber. Driver took 12 minutes longer then what the app said. No problem, there was traffic. App said he was at the pick up location but he was not. Never showed up at the airport pick up location. Called him and he said okay, wait 2 more minutes. Then I got charged $5 and he wouldn’t answer his phone again. And the app started over."
1529,dave king V the goat,"June 17, 2019",5,"Love and hate For the most part I have wonderful rides and experiences with your drivers but for the last 2 days a couple of your drivers are horrible they cancel rides, go to wrong places and don’t reply to text messages and can’t even read them or understand. I am calling lyft now and if I am not compensated for my couple last rides I will not be using lyft anymore I will go back to using uber"
1530,HG's Well,"September 7, 2018",4,No promos anymore I’ve been a Lyft customer since 2014 when they launched in Buffalo for a couple of months until ride sharing services got scrapped in Buffalo. They used to offer pretty good promos every once in a while. I got some again after they relaunched in Buffalo in ‘17; but ever since then there’s been nothing even though I’ve used it pretty consistently. I think that’s definitely a benefit I would like to see being offered for a customer who sticks with them.
1531,taym94,"September 12, 2018",5,Lyft is better than Uber! I have been using lyft for a long time and I love it so much!!!!! I love how fast my ride picks me up I’ve never waited longer than 7 minutes and my driver always finds thefastest  route to my home. If you are trying to decide between Uber or lyft go lyft! The prices are great and they always have amazing deals going on like 20% off for the month and other awesome stuff. I will always use and recommend lyft!

1533,DBarnsNY,"September 15, 2018",5,"Always issues Lyft’s service is great but the app is a real roadblock. Talking to a driver right now about all the times his directions are wrong, arrival estimates constantly change after booking a ride, drivers appear to be making circles constantly when they don’t. Cars are rescheduled without notice. Not sure where this became a complicated process. Lyft probably just needs to focus on the customer again."
1534,Sdfhhvd,"September 29, 2018",4,"Terrible App design This app is probably one of the worst designed apps on the market. If you want to change any of your settings, be they your home address or custom destinations, god help you. I accidentally mistyped my home address and it wouldn’t let me change it from the beginning, and is seemingly imposible to change after setting up the app."
1535,PNWEli,"October 29, 2018",1,GPS issue As someone who used this app for over 3 years I had a lots of issues with app. Must important is GPS issue. For pick up always should I walk to other points I don’t understand why app is confused about my address. Other problem is yesterday i scheduled my ride for 5AM but app sends my driver by 4:30AM ( which is 30min early😡)
1536,jgmaynard,"October 29, 2018",1,"Garbage App, Garbage Company! These multi-billionaires care nothing about their customers, and they don’t hold to standard business practices. Have a credit? Doesn’t matter - they won’t honor it unless you have enough in your bank account to double the cost of the ride. Want to return your credit to the person who gave it to you? Doesn’t matter! They won’t do that either!"
1537,Natalie Cowan 11',"November 20, 2018",5,Needs some updates It would be helpful if there was a special instruction box that you could enter in info such as gate codes and apartment numbers so you could communicate before hand. So you can put instructions to the driver. Maybe the names of the people they’re picking up if you ordered the uber for a friend. Give the drivers better instructions to find you. But all in all it’s usually the cheapest.
1538,fittobesquare,"December 24, 2018",1,"Criminal drivers I took a ride with Lyft and the driver stole my purse, keys, wallet, everything...then locked me in my car and took off with all of my belongings, leaving only my phone behind so that I couldn’t track him.  There was no number to contact him and no number I could call for Lyft.  My only option was to send an email.  I was stranded with no car keys, my alarm going off, and no way to get help.  This is a horrible company for customer service and they have criminals working for them.  There should be a phone support!   I am working with the police but my safety has been compromised and I am left without my belongings.  Horrible nightmare.  Please beware!!!"

1540,Mdalabih,"January 5, 2018",1,Used to work It used to work. For the last week however after I request a ride it tells me that the driver has arrived when the location shows they are several blocks away. Then my drive starts when I’m not even in the car. Cancelling it is difficult. Riders are just picking random people. Especially in busy cities it seems. Now try to call Lyft for a complaint... good luck. You can’t even submit a complaint unless it is one of a list of complaints they approve from a select down menu. In other words if it is not something they want to track they just don’t want to hear it. One start. Deleted the app.
1541,ctgb._,"January 11, 2018",4,"Great low prices but “Payment Method” Problems I only have a debit card , and I put my information in and it says “Please update your payment method” & I don’t understand why it says that too me when I make sure that I have money on my card before I use the app. Please update it so that it accepts Debit and Credit Cards just like Uber does. But I hate using uber because I spend $10 or more every time I wanna go somewhere. I like using Lyft and want to continue to using Lyft. So please update it."
1542,Ancient Millennial,"February 6, 2018",3,"Totally unreliable service I use Uber and Lyft everyday, I had been using Lyft more because of the bad press Uber has gotten but there is a noticeable difference in service. Nearly every morning, one or more Lyft drivers accept my ride request and cancel before they arrive. They’ve made me late for work on several occasions and my boss has even mentioned it to me. I have tried calling earlier to give myself twice as much time to get to work yet they still manage to make me late. I’m deleting the app and sticking to Uber, it’s the lesser of two evils."

1544,Stephy 2K,"July 24, 2018",3,"Lyft I started using Lyft because Uber could never find my apartments. I like Lyft but I will say that their drivers and cars are shady. I’ve been in countless cars that reeked of weed and cigarettes. I’ve had drivers proposition me. I’ve been in an accident...Spilled my coffee on myself when a driver tried to avoid rear ending someone. The whole gamut. I think Lyft works, but they could definitely work on recruiting better drivers that take care of their cars and are more proud of the work they do. It’s a little disappointing. I definitely feel I downgraded by choosing to support Lyft"
1545,Tatis23,"July 31, 2018",1,"Problem with follow up The Lyft driver was exceptional, but at the drop off one of the passengers left a cell phone. Tried to stop him but couldn’t get his attention. After going to lyft help online, we called the number, they called back right away, we told them the problem and they said we take these situations very seriously, we will call the driver and get the situation straightened out. The woman said they would call back later in the afternoon or the next day. We heard nothing and went back to lyft help, never got a call from them. "
1546,pangry14jan1991,"August 3, 2018",1,Wrong drop off I was going for my interview and hoping that Lyft would drop me at right time and at exact address .. sadly Lyft dropped me at wrong address and even when I told driver it isn’t the place where I had asked for drop off he said this is the address that his app shows and it was raining.. so imagine he left me there and after searching and searching finally when I reached at the destination I was late for 20 min I had to walk for 20 min following the gps..because of which I didn’t get to give the interview .. so people next time when u order a Lyft make sure ur driver drops u at the right address .. because even few min matters I.

Lyft allows me to align who I am with what I do—one can ask for no more in a career! I am grateful to Lyft on both fronts, as a customer and as a driver.

Today, for Lyft, as a driver as well as a passenger, I am very disappointed. The first driver, I waited 6 minutes, did not come, instead I think he of Lyft cancelled and provided me another driver. The first driver was 3-4 minutes away and waited him 6 minutes, the second driver was 8 minutes away, I waited her 23 minutes and still she  was 3 minutes away. Since she was 3 minutes away maybe for 8-10 minutes, I cancelled the ride. This is totally shame. I think Lyft or the drivers should fix their problems as soon as possible. This causes passengers to chose alternative companies."

Nothing to do when that happens. Coming in this trip from the airport cost me about double and I’m in the same area? So was it because the driver took an alternate route to run up his fare? No idea. Generally tho it’s a good service, there’s been two times when the person was not very bright and had difficulty but I can’t complain about that they did the best they could lol"
1550,Thrust702,"September 16, 2017",1,Don't Believe the hype. Lyft is actually the worst ride share company of all. I'm a 5.0 star driver after driving for a full year. I wake up to be deactivated one morning and have never had a ticket or complaint. My background hasn't changed either. They won't even talk to me now. #Lame it's like they've unfriended and blocked me. Rich men sitting in the hills as we run our cars into the ground for them. As soon as they get their driverless cars they are thrilled because nobody can write reviews or complain. Lyft money doesn't always come before morals and you should be ashamed to act like you are any better than your competitors because that is far from the truth.
1551,James whitt,"October 2, 2017",5,"Why Texts? I just installed Lyft because my Uber account is not working on my new phone and am tempted to delete it right away. It keeps sending me text message updates about my driver. Why can’t it use an in-app notification? Now I have to go to my texts, click open a text which contains the same information as the app. Just because it has my phone number doesn’t mean the app should abuse it!"
1552,Docror B,"February 8, 2020",4,Ease of identification of vehicle from FRONT in busy Airport. As vehicles in Florida don’t have front license plate there should be something in front of car that shows to the clients when the vehicle approaches from front in a very crowded vehicles in the area. Lyft just can’t text saying “vehicle is there and will leave in 5 minutes and no-show charges will incur”. Such message never comes from Uber and if u want to compete with U we u better not try that as u will loose customers. 🙏🏼
1553,Phillypsychic,"January 14, 2020",1,"Disappointment Unfortunately, when there’s a problem/mishap there is no way of contacting customer service. January 14, 2020 I requested a Lyft to my surprise  the driver said there was NO address only a street... how is this possible? when I put in the full complete address. We debated back and forth and could not change or add in the address, nevertheless, the driver put me out of his vehicle, where there was not much traffic, train tracks, I was extremely far from my destination. As a long time customer, I’ve never felt so violated & disrespect, not to mention having to pay double to order another driver to pick me up. I expect compensation,"
1554,Flamingjellyfish,"December 21, 2019",5,"Better than Uber It’s not perfect — sometimes the pick up location is a little off, sometimes you get a driver who’s too aggressive — but basically it works. Sometimes I’ve had some really fun interactions with drivers or other passengers. "

But if I enter blogs next door 105 etc. it come to the correct block. But wrong doors.  Only if I chase car (in snow etc) or call driver do they see me.  And several drivers do not understand. And tell me their Rnglish is not good understanding w/o map being correct. Right bldg number and position are the problem.  Otherwise drivers all great
1556,Hockers123,"November 5, 2019",4,Maps and directions for gated communities I have a pretty good experience with Lyft and drivers are always very pleasant. The maps the drivers use and instructions for getting to the exact pickup let you down. I live I. A recently gated community and there are no instruction options to help the drivers for that last piece of the arrival. Txt don’t always seem to get through and not all drivers answer their phone so I suggest improving the app and map to help them.
1557,Vegas N,"October 14, 2019",1,No-No Last Driver hit his arrival timer before he arrived at designated pickup spot. He started timer as he arrived at hotel line and in traffic. I almost got a did not show charge and he hadn’t even arrived at designated ride share pickup spot. I had like 30 seconds left before he could just take off. I pointed that out to him and he got irate. I was charged a no show fee already by Lyft the day prior with no call and confusion on pickup spot. I didn’t want another and if you would take off the one I did get it would be nice. Would you send out message to all drivers to NOT start timer until they actually arrive at the pickup location correctly
1558,Bayah_Bear14,"September 29, 2019",1,"Disappointed Why is that every time I request my lyft in certain times they’re ALWAYS UNAVAILABLE?

I understand he was doing a ride and was going to take awhile. While he was almost 10 minutes away??? HE PASSED OFF THE RIDE AND WE HAD TO WAIT AND WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO ACCEPT IT. NO ONE DID. So i went to Uber and within 1 minute we were accepted, very friendly man. I’m so disappointed with lyft this is the 3rd time you’ve let me down.

Also there’s no contact to reach a live person and that’s really bad!

Lyft drivers were going to the outside of my Apartment complex every time I scheduled a ride, and would leave when they didn’t see me, I tried calling the drivers each time but some didn’t answer, or some would answer and I would tell them they are in the wrong place, but still fail to come to where my address is. I have been charged several fees for that, and only refunded on one. I am very upset about this, and will not be using Lyft anymore if their drivers can’t follow a simple address/directions right."

Charles had went went out of his way to make sure I had a pleasant safe and comfortable ride with him 😊😊 therefore I am giving him five stars awesome experience !!

1568,Ace🎱⚓️,"July 11, 2019",5,Lyft Shared I hate lyft shared. It should be an option to ride by yourself without making stops. If there is an option I cannot get to it. It’s very time consuming. Whenever I request lyft that gives me enough time to get to work on time. But then all these shares come up and makes me extra late for work. I know that if I have this problem a lot of other people have this problem as well.
1569,karen of colorado,"June 24, 2019",5,Great driver tell the lyft In Indianapolis Lyft  needs to improve lis act. I had to wait an hour and a half to go half a mile. Once Brandi came she was great but Lyft did not find a driver and did not communicate with me . At booking tone they said it would be 45 minutes to an hour.  Then no contact. No news til brandi arrived. This after 90 minutes  waiting. This lack of communication is not acceptable. Shame on you Lyft!  you are capable of much better!

1573,cab generation,"November 24, 2018",4,"Airport protocol? I’ve only used Lyft a few times, But requesting a Lyft from the airport was slightly confusing.   Typically, I confirm my pick up address, and I notified that someone will be there within a certain amount of time.   But being picked up at the airport requires a two step confirmation, which wasn’t very clear. So I sat outside for 15 minutes not realizing that I had to confirm that I was at the airport, and then also confirm that I was in the pick up zone and ready for a car"

When the ride is over you will be asked to rate the driver and select a tip amount. I do that and then I am presented with an expense report screen that I don’t care about so I close the app. Then I get text message asking me to rate the driver. I always assumed that this was automatic. I just went back and discovered that half the drivers were never tipped. I still have no idea how I am supposed to rate and tip so it is actually recorded.

Lyft used to be good with drivers arriving on time, plenty of local drivers and accurate gps maps. It’s been a few months now where I have noticed that once I book a car, it takes a while to find a driver and they tend to bounce around switching drivers until one finally accepts the ride. I’ve had multiple situation where drivers arrive and cancel right in front of me. We are not able to report this or rate those drivers. I just had this happen to me literally right now AGAIN! I’m switching back to Uber."

The biggest problem I have with the app is there’s no way to rate the route like there used to. Only the driver, which is unfortunate. Especially since lyfts algorithm for shared rides is pretty bad compared to Uber. It CANNOT be trusted to get you to work on time. I’ve learned this lesson multiple times. Don’t take a lyft line if you have a meeting. "

And getting drivers to be as nice as they used to is impossible."

There are a lot of nyc transplants moving here that don’t drive and theres a lack of drivers here  You also need at least 1 -2 drivers available before 5 am   I need to get to the city sometimes at 6 am or 7 which means I’ve got to get to metro north at least at 4 and 5 am and there’s nothing that early in the morning. I am forced to use Uber and I don’t like Uber. Help me get to work!!!!!!!
1584,Aireyale Sanders,"October 9, 2018",3,Might not use this anymore...... I've been using Lyft for about 2 years and never had a problem with it to 2 weeks ago. I schedule my ride at 10 am for 2:45pm I had to be a work at 3 and the company cancelled my ride 5-10 minutes before my ride was supposed to be here so I had my mom schedule me one and it was confirmed and a guy told her he never confirmed it and I could've still been on time but instead he went back to the company and cancelled my ride. This was the 3rd time in 2 days they've cancelled my rides! 🤬
1585,Also Fed-Up,"April 10, 2020",4,Update PU / Drop Off I typically use LYFT because the pricing is better but my last ride the price changed last minute due to the issue with the Pick Up and Drop Off settings. The app wouldn’t recognize my drop off and it had me being picked up and dropped off at the same location. How can the app allow this?? I also had to go to my maps to get both addresses because the “map” in the app didn’t recognize the correct addresses.
1586,sherbertt2717,"February 15, 2020",1,Half the time the purple locator isn’t at pickup spot Just had a horrible experience where the purple locator for pickup was no where near where the pickup location but 5 mins away from pickup location. Ended up charging me a $5 cancellation fee which is incredibly unfair. Reached out to customer service only for them to shut me out saying they follow GPS. I wanted to show them a picture showing them that it’s no where near where my pickup location was. Thankfully my second driver knew to actually drive to my pickup location instead of following the purple dot locator. Very frustrated - this isn’t the first time it’s happened. :/

1588,Kris20009,"January 3, 2020",4,"Generally great I often take lyft to and from medical appointments several times a week and to work.  However, Lyft has a bad habit of deceitfully saying a ride is a short distance a way when it’s clear the car isn’t. This has an impact on me making my appointments and getting to work on time. Other than that, the rides are generally nice. Some drivers need to learn to read the passenger’s mood- getting is to talk won’t necessarily change or increase your tip."

I wasted a lot of time trying to get a lyft home but when the driver pulled up they cancelled the ride. This happened twice in a row and wasted 30 minutes of my time because the app took a long while to find the drivers that would then only make me wait for them to pull up and cancel. Users should be able to report drivers that do this within the app. If I were able to see my rating I may be able to see if I’m being turned down because of a bad rating, but unlike Uber the user can’t directly see their rating in the app."

On shared rides even if you order first and it goes out of your way to pick up and drop off someone else the gps for Lyft will do it. I have never had any of these experiences with Uber. I hate to say it but Lyft is the worst service for getting a ride somewhere. I’ve had a few of the most foul drivers, and inappropriate ones as well and all only through Lyft. I think they have lower standards and guidelines. I’ve actually never had a good experience through Lyft and I hate to say that. I literally hate being this person but this is a constant thing."

I’m not certain if it’s the tall buildings which is affecting the GOS but I almost was never found or the ride wasn’t where they would say they are. In fact one driver left me stranded because her GPS said she was there but she wasn’t. The app also showed me the wrong direction to walk! And then I got charged a no show fee!!! All in all decent app but I might need to switch to Uber when I’m in a bigger city as my friend used them and had no issues. But the rest of us using Lyft had tons of trouble.

So clearly lyft thinks they can charge more bc they big now but, trust I spend 1000s of dollars on this app. Secondly, the routes become more insufficient by the day.

I did have a male driver and try to cancel it and didn’t know if thats a feature or you are stuck with whoever picks you but I’d really appreciate to be able to cancel if I don't feel comfortable with the driver. I know I do have anxiety and it’s likely a personal problem but if I could cancel within the first few seconds of seeing who my driver id appreciate that.

1600,Yogabutt11,"April 5, 2018",3,Need closer pick up times For the most part I really like using Lyft. It’s the only app I use for rides. I live in LA and the biggest problem I have is that Lyft often times has a wait of over 15 minutes for a ride. They pick drivers who aren’t close enough and then with traffic the wait can be up to 20 minutes. This is really bad. I call a Lyft 30 minutes before I need to be into work (10 minute drive at most) and still end up being late. I hope you can do better or I will be using you less.

Our next driver, after telling him what happened, stated some drivers cancel rides because they only see the ride distance after they are at the guests pick up location. Having someone pull up and then immediately speed away was a very unpleasant interaction and prejudicial behavior. This type of driver behavior needs to be addressed to avoid these interactions from happening again."

Please add back that feature for the drivers and add a penalty for last minute cancels (like you have on riders). Losing 25 minutes when trying to make a flight is about as bad a ride experience as someone can have. Back to good ol days of scheduling a cab pick up for me!"

I’ve had multiple incidents where I’ve tried to cancel a ride and been unable to do, then been charged. The routing for Lyft line is terrible too. There have been times where my ETA has been increased by as much as 30 minutes because Lyft has inefficient routing that often adds people in the opposite direction that I’m going in. They should also really think about integrating traffic data in the ETAs they give you. By not integrating traffic it sets the rider and driver up for frustration by giving unrealistic ETAs."
1631,Shellfish22,"October 1, 2018",5,Difficulty contacting left by phone. Why is there no customer service person able to take a phone call when you’re having a problem. My mother is 92 and uses Lyft often however she would not know how to navigate on the Internet to write a review or call with a concern and then go to a website. You should have people who are there to answer the phone
1632,MR!3579,"October 3, 2018",4,"Feature Request Overall, the app works well and is very similar to other ride sharing apps. I have a feature request: ride preferences. Sometimes you have drivers who are overly chatty at inopportune times such as early AM and late evening. It would be handy when requesting the ride to be able to select “feeling chatty” or “a quiet ride” that way the driver does not inadvertently annoy a rider who just wanted a quiet ride. This could also even help a driver earn a bigger tip!"

HOWEVER, the instructions on where to meet at Ontario airport were unclear. The signage at baggage claim needs to specify that Lyft drivers cannot go to baggage claim and must stay at the departure doors. And the Lyft app took us east instead of west to our destination. It’s a good thing that I knew how to get there on my own. I will not hesitate to call Lyft again. It’s almost like having someone you know give you a ride."

Lucky Teddy my last driver was kind enough to come pick me up, but after a long day of flying and arriving at my home airport the last thing I am looking forward too is to be stood up by my ride. Lyft needs to have a better system for making the drivers not discriminate based on ride distance!!!"

1637,Beefmister13,"February 16, 2019",1,Lyft maps wrong location I used lyft for the first time cause I was at a ducks game and supposedly lyft give you $5 off after the game for a ride but it was the same price that my Uber was to the game so either they are really high priced or they did not give me the discount. Also the Honda center was in the wrong location on there maps and showed it on the on ramp to the freeway so I had to walk a block to there pick up location once I realized it was an on-ramp I had to edit the pick up and had to walk back the block to a different location that was still not the Honda center parking lot. Not a fun first trip maybe I should stick with Uber!

I’m not sure why this app kind of punishes me for checking to see how far away a ride will be when we have to be at work at a certain time and then I go back in a few moments later to actually get the ride then it’s 20 mins away and my boyfriend can go on his phone and it’s ten mins away......why can’t we schedule a lyft for certain times so this doesn’t happen???

I’ve just recently downloaded and used the app and have had been charged for lyft rides that weren’t me. I’ve spoken to people in my community (friends and family) and they have had the same experience with being charged extra lyft rides on their banking statements. They need a better MORE SECURE system.

Came to realized that lyft app was the one because there was no difficulty. The rides can be pricer then uber depending where you’re heading to but you get a $5 off on your first ride if you use the count “Pinkballons”. So far the drivers are really nice and friendly.
1643,TDRock,"July 30, 2018",3,"Works Fine, Stopped asking about Notifications However now I’m having the problem… In a recent upgrade the Lyft app finally made it so that you can see the price for all the ride options. Similar to the way the Uber app is, you can see the price for a Shared and regular and the fancy rides all at once. However every time I log out of the app, when I log back in it reverts back to the old style of the Lyft app. I’ve upgraded the app about three times now since the new design and it keeps doing that."

Unfortunately I use them like vehicle and never receive discounts or promotional emails. My mother always received email discounts off her rides. There needs to be a special program for “everyday” Lyft riders. The special promotion plan doesn’t work for me either because I take more than 25 rides per weak.
1645,lyft lies,"August 16, 2018",3,"Needs to be easier to pick a pick up time. Good ap. I think it’s relative but one of the MOsT important factors is asking for a pick up time and this was not easy. I was immediately assigned a driver and a pick up time of 5 min. That was way to soon. So the driver had to cancel it so I didn’t get charged a cancellation fee. Then I got assigned another driver who was 15 min away. It would be easier if I could easily choose my pick up time when I schedule, before I confirm and submit. And trying to pick a Nic name is RIDICULOUSLY difficult!"
1646,Pretti_shell,"August 18, 2018",1,Charges with no show and no pick up There’s no phone number for customer service or to contact anyone 1st. I had requested for pick up. I can see the driver was still 3 Mins away from entering my complex when he put “Arrived” he didn’t try to call me and 30 seconds later charges me while I’m still standing where I was waiting to be picked up.  if there’s unauthorized charge you have to write through the app to resolve it then they will review. Thanks to Douglas I was waiting for another person to pick me us which I used UBER for since I didn’t want another problem with Lyft. I really wished there was better customer service

1662,NEVERLYFTAGAIN,"August 25, 2018",1,State fair BS We just requested a Lyft to the same spot we got dropped off at in a lift and she was sent to the other side of the fair grounds. WHY that would happen or WHY Lyft would have 2 pick up/ drop off sites especially when we were RIGHT NEXT to the sight we got dropped off at and had no Idea about the other one. We got charged WAY more because she had to come to the other sight. Had I known I was going to be charged so much I would have cancelled and called an Uber. As a loyal and frequent Lyft user I feel as though I have been duped and made to pay more simply because Lyft can’t get it together and send it’s drivers to the right spots. Livid.
1663,Wkbweb,"September 6, 2018",5,Which side of the street? We’ve used Lyft several times during our trip to NYC. Works really well. The only catch in New York is that the app will say the driver has arrived but you can’t see them. Sometimes they’re down the street or across the street or waiting around the corner of a large building. We figured it out but it wasn’t easy. Once we found the driver all went well.

I contacted lyft through email stating my concerns. They emailed me back asking for specific details of the ride and stated they they would email me back. Lyft then charged me and never emailed me back. I’ve used other commuting apps and have never had to deal with such unprofessionalism.

I think back to just how reasonably and caring she was about my well being... she is a fantastic communicator... made me feel warm and at home in her vehicle for the duration of our trip... when it comes to someone working this late this is the kind of employee anyone should be chomping at the bit after...
1693,disappointed customer 376,"July 25, 2019",1,"Unable to solve account issue Lyft is unable to help solve account issue. Reaching out to support team is not useful at all and they disabled my account without providing any reasonable explanation. As a ride-sharing platform, Lyft is expected to provide great service and convenience to the general public. However, as a customer, I was really disappointed after contacting support team time over time. I asked for further contact information about what I can do to solve the problem and they just said I will be no longer to join the Lyft platform. It’s not what a service company should do and what customer would expect."
1694,Moneymcduck,"July 13, 2019",5,Great app great driver App was very easy to use. I set it up the night before my trip.  Nice that the driver has a pic you can look at as well as a pic of the car.  I like also that you can easily call to talk with the driver if you are having difficulty finding the exact pick up point.  Driver was friendly and professional.  This was my first time using Lyft.  I will use it again for sure.
1695,SeanDog88,"July 12, 2019",5,"Beats Uber hands down!! Lyft is simple and easy to use. I love it. I ride to and from work. Friendly drivers, comfortable clean vehicles. I also love the new option to tip while I’m riding. This is a great idea instead of having to wait after. However, there does need to be a fix to where when I tip while riding, it doesn’t ask me to tip again after the ride. Other than that, great app and the best!!!"
1696,Chi Pu Pu,"June 25, 2019",1,"Do NOT buy the 10% off unlimited rides Smart Savings Plan! I bought the 10% off unlimited rides Smart Savings Plan, and it supposes to help me save money. At first, it did. However, Lyft started raising the original price for my rides. (My friend searched for the same departure and the same destination at the same time, but got a much lower price than I did. ) So I actually spent more money even after 10% off. After buying this ride pass, Lyft just knows you are going to use the app more often and they can force you to accept a much higher price for every ride. To sum up, do NOT buy the 10% off unlimited rides Smart Savings Plan!"

What a pleasant experience to feel confident in your driver going across town in a busy city! Not only were both drivers pleasant & informative but punctual, professional and a pleasure to meet! Thank you Lyft for choosing first class people to make your business work well."
1699,the'guy,"June 12, 2019",5,Very professional and friendly We just landed in SF international airport at midnight and searched Uber but the fee was $78 to get home so we downloaded lyft for the first time and it’s only $48 instead.  We booked lyft and the driver was there less than 10 minutes later.  He waited for us for about 25 minutes to get our luggage... didn’t complain or anything.  We’ll definitely use lyft more often. 👍
1700,Alicia 187,"October 9, 2018",3,"Excellent service and prices Compared the competition “Uber”, Lyft is so much better. Drivers are more friendly and can follow gps directions. With the exception of one driver I had a horrible experience with; he threatened to put me and my child out on the side of the road. Prices are so reasonable as well. I tip the drivers because the prices are so awesome. Lol I love riding with Lyft!"
1701,jluphl,"October 21, 2018",5,"Lyft lets you go places Lyft has changed my life letting me go where no cab would take me. Living in the city, I have access to public transportation, but when I have luggage, need to get somewhere quickly with door to door service, or at night, Lyft makes it possible. Love the option to add destinations to a Lyft trip so I can pick up and drop off friends. Also like that I can call the driver if needed."
1702,Eliseeekennedy,"November 16, 2018",2,Location accuracy The fact that lyft takes your money if your ride waits to long is fine but the fact that most of the lyft drivers dont even pick up the phone to help spot the rider. Ive called multiple times and ended up having to chase my ride because  they rode past my location which is A LOT when your “driver departs in 60 sec.” when I was driving for lyft I ALWAYS answered my phone calls especially because I KNOW the number lyft uses to connect me and riders. It makes me feel lie its an easy way for people to make extra cash or an innocent mistake.
1703,Disappointed Viking,"November 17, 2018",5,"First Lyft experience favorable My wife and I previously were Uber riders.  We decided to switch to Lyft after being billed for over $4,000 in fraudulent charges by Uber, which the credit card company had to write off.  I found the Lyft app user friendly and straightforward.  Our driver arrived within 6 minutes.  He assisted us with our baggage.  The car was clean and in good condition.  Definitely using Lyft again."

1705,knottyhero,"November 30, 2018",5,"Keeps getting better I’ve become a fan of Lyft from other share ride companies. I have hope for future for this company. They hired the former transportation secretary of the President Obama administration. I expect good things to come.  In closing, I would recommend criminal background checks and drug testing. With the legalization of marijuana in states, I do not want to put my life in the hands of a “high” driver.  Keep up the good work!"
1706,Cherrybombxxoo,"December 5, 2018",2,Very time consuming I was a very big fan of lyft but lately they’ve been slacking BIG time. I’d wait 10 to 15 minutes for a ride and right when the driver is three minutes away I get replaced with another driver leaving me to wait ANOTHER 10 to 15 minutes that I don’t have to spare. They used to inform you when your driver is being switched but now they just do it with no prior warning. It’s become extremely time consuming and when you need help on the matter they already have preset questions that don’t relate to the problem. Please fix this lyft!
1707,Happyostrich,"January 25, 2019",2,"Honesty Problems They lie about promos, they lie about fees, they lie about the time itll take before tge driver arrives. It’ll give an estimate of 6 minutes then when a driver is selected it’ll be more like 20. Over and over. I got a 5 minute cancellation fee, after about 30 seconds from when it picked a driver. I complained and got a credit, but on my next ride the credit had disappeared. I went back and forth with them, first they said it expired 3 days before I was granted the credit, then that it expired 2 weeks after. I deleted the app. I got enough people trying to rip me off."
1708,IJustWantTheBusNow,"January 31, 2019",1,"Quality has been in sharp decline for years. It’s a real shame what’s going on with these rideshare apps. I prefer to ride lyft over uber because the cars are usually cleaner, drivers are better, and routes more efficient. And I don’t mind paying $4 more over uber for those perks. That used to be the case. Nowadays there is a 40% chance the car you’re getting into you’ll want to get a tetanus shot when you walk out of it. The re-routing has gotten so bad, the drivers having gotten more frustrating, and the pricing having only gone up. Most of the time, I just wish I took the bus, which now paradoxically seem cleaner."
1709,V Kalunian,"April 28, 2019",5,"Drivers cancel rides I like lyft but it is frustrating when drivers cancel rides last minute. We would schedule a pick up and it would say a few minutes, then turn into 15 minutes, then the driver would cancel. This kept happening one night and it is ridiculous. Why except a ride when they are just going to cancel....."
1710,Livid133,"January 22, 2018",5,Tips I would like to post it while I’m in the ride so I don’t have to pay cash. How do I do that so they know they are getting a tip?
1711,cocoraquel,"April 9, 2018",1,"Riders beware I’ve rode with lyft plenty of times. On my birthday I rode with them, then two days later I had to look in my bank statement to see that had charged me 150 dollars for a damage fee. They then told me in an email that the driver said I puked in his car. Then after arguing with them because they had no actual proof only what the driver said, they told me I would have to wait for the money to go back into my account and that the driver misnamed me. Horrible customer service! The customer service guy literally said, “yeah we made a mistake but the moneys going back so what’s the problem still?” Definitely uninstalling and sticking with Uber!"
1712,genevievetoo,"May 31, 2018",1,"Service has gone downhill Unfortunately, I have to agree with a lot of the other recent reviews - Lyft has really taken a turn for the worse. Customer service is not only totally impersonal now, but it also takes a very long time - IF they get back to you. Also a lot of unprofessional drivers - on the phone, don't know the routes and take MUCH longer drives, one guy didn't even realize he was picking me up when I opened the door! They have a lot of great drivers too, but I've just had so many bad experiences lately that I just don't think I can use them anymore. I don't know what's happened, but it's a real shame."
1713,War35785,"July 27, 2018",5,"Recent issues In the last 1-2 weeks I have observed VERY long wait times for a car to arrive. A car from across SF is selected rather than others that appear right next to me. Example: I was in SOMA and lyft gave me a car in north beach with a 15 min wait...the supply can’t be this bad in SF, I’m guessing matching algo issue. "
1714,KLR95125,"July 29, 2018",5,"Shoreline Awful experience for pick up at Shoreline. We seriously waited at least 45 minutes for our first Lyft driver. The whole time, the estimated time was 5 minutes. Meanwhile, 45 minutes later, we are almost the only ones still waiting for a ride. I finally called the driver and he told me to just cancel. Everyone else was getting picked up no problem. Ridiculous."
1715,Marilyn_Monroe_Blonde,"August 7, 2018",5,My opinion of Lyft I have switched to Lyft primarily because of the ease of using the app . Especially the “cancel ride” feature which is not hidden away as one other popular car service . By the time I am able to find the “cancel ride” feature it’s already past the time limit and I get charged .
1716,Travel Sam,"September 9, 2018",5,Kauai - Aloha style We used Lyft 3 separate occasions while visiting the island of Kauai. We always had prompt pick up service under 5 minutes and delivered to destination within trip time. ALL drivers were courteous & friendly with conversation. Jimmy was so nice taking my Aunt & I to the airport- and even loaded & unloaded our luggage.

I don’t own a vehicle any more so transportation is scared for me and my children so for your ride share company to be there is definitely a plus ! Thank you guys again ! And keep up the Good Work.!
1718,sacgabble,"September 29, 2018",5,"Excellent Driver, I road with Ruben he was such a kind and observant kind of driver he knew all of my likes and dislikes just by our conversation. I rated him 5Stars because it was not about him it was about his passenger and how I was feeling he didn’t know that I was going through a sad time in my life. But what he did know is let me make this lady’s trip a good ride because I am concerned about how my passengers are at the end of the day."
1719,aTRUEreviewer,"January 26, 2020",1,"Get Uber I would 1,000,000% unequivocally never use or recommend anyone else to use this app.  Lyft first off does not care about their customers at all.  In fact, they’ll charge you for a ride you never got, leave you in the middle of the night stranded, and then tel you if you want a ride you can pay for another one.  They also made no attempts in reaching out to apologize or anything for the issue.  Just offered me a hilarious $5 credit.  I would give this pathetic company zero stars but I have to give it one star.  I’m not a fan of Uber really either but I’d definitely recommend Uber over this dreadful service."
1720,Cut70,"January 25, 2020",5,"Fast Pickup Lyft is consistency faster finding a ride than Uber. Big or small markets they are superior. I have to assume all drivers use all applications to find users, but Lyft must be their first pick. The drivers over the past year tend to have cleaner cars, and have been more pleasant.  Overall Lyft has been a better  option, especially when demand for rides are at there peak."
1721,Puzzled driver,"January 19, 2020",4,Pickup location Getting to the right pick up location was very confusing. Life needs to use a different description for how to get to the pickup spot. Having two locations doesn’t help. We missed our first ride because we couldn’t get to the right spot. The next try we had to wait longer because I wanted to make sure we were in the right spot. We were not the only confused people either.
1722,Nayr2000ca,"December 22, 2019",3,Needs work on driver assignment Lyft is similar to Uber the main draw back is who they driver they match you to.  I have been matched many a times to a person that still has to drop a passenger off no where near me. They pair you well before the drop off location. 
1723,Milehighscuba,"November 25, 2019",2,"Battery drain and unwanted alerts The app is a major battery drain and why does it need location services when not using? Why spam alerts when it has not been used in weeks and months. I use the app when traveling 2-4 times a year but receive near daily alerts from the app. Checking battery drain even though it is not used drain is high when compared to other transportation apps, data use was high as well. My solution is to delete and pay for the extra data when I determine I might need it."
1724,MMHEQ,"October 29, 2019",5,Great app! Easy to use and intuitive! So many options for payment and pickup make it easy to ride.

I look forward to whomever will end up being my driver, as each one has a special story of their life experiences. They’re also good listeners, even while they pay attention to the traffic situations. My son introduced me to taking Lyft and I’m convinced it’s the best!"
1727,Keytothetruth,"October 8, 2019",3,Potential to be great The routes created by Lyft are ridiculously off. Not only does it waste my time but also wastes the drivers time. I’m exhausted just thinking about the route troubles I’ll face in the future if I continue to use Lyft. Get more accurate or be prepared to lose more customers to other competing services. Only positive thing I have to say is the prices are a couple cents sometimes a couple dollars cheaper in comparison to other ride services. That just might not be worth it in exchange for peace of mind.

I don’t care about how you had to give away your 12th cat and can’t afford spaying. I just want to get from A to B in silence without having to be rude sometimes

I haven’t had issues the few times I’ve used Lyft in the past, but now that I’m injured and on crutches, I was really hoping to use them to help me get around the city.

I also enjoy being able to pay through the app and being able to give feedback through it. "
1749,Struckshade,"September 17, 2018",5,"Convenient & Practical The Lyft app has been a real lifesaver for me in the past.  It’s easy to use and has great features. I love that I can watch my driver actually arrive in real time.  It’s also reassuring to be able to ID your driver/car and get a price upfront.  It could be improved by adding a feature to repeat a request for a particular driver and provide more promo codes.  Other than that, kudos to Lyft!"
1750,Sofakingpretty,"October 6, 2017",1,"Horrible drivers Well now I see why the other ride share app is preferred. I put in a request 2 hours before I needed to be at the airport. The driver arrived and looked shocked when she saw I had a carry on. She began to whine about how much traffic there would be and how she hadn't filled up on gas. I told her it would be okay if we stopped for gas. As we continue driving, she then states that she has an appointment coming up soon and that the car she has isn't even hers. Do your drivers not know how to read before accepting a ride? Now I'm scrambling to find another ride and I'm probably going to miss my flight. Thanks a lot."

1752,Summer0740,"March 5, 2020",1,Hidden charge I took a Lyft with. 25% coupon from work to home. I was quoted that after the 25% off it would be somewhere around 12-13 dollars. When I checked the next day I was charged over double that. I disputed it to have a costumer service person tell me I wasn’t quoted. As if I am a liar. I disputed it again and then was told that I was charged a prime time charge that can sometimes be a HIDDEN charge. I was not offered a refund or a discounted rate for anything. My whole experience with their costumer service was terrible. You can’t be charging people double without their approval and then not do anything for them.

1754,k8-70,"February 15, 2020",4,"Everything is excellent but need a bit of idiotproofing First time using Lyft and in a new city (San Francisco), from SFO. While the instructions how to get to the pickup spot were probably absolutely correct they did not match the limited signage inside the airport. For example, “level 5” was nowhere on any signs. For a location like that perhaps someone needs to walk it with the eyes of a tourist right off a flight to make your directions absolutely idiotproof."

It’s really sad how the app is getting worse and worse. I have been wasted hours of my life waiting for a cab at times (when I had no other means of transportation). Most of the times it’s not even the driver’s fault. The app crashes at the worst times ever. This one time I booked a ride and it showed me that the car is 6 mins away, literally after three seconds the car moved to a totally different spot, indicating 16 mins away."

But, I have found in the last month or so I’ve had trouble getting a ride whether or not it’s a shared ride or not. I have waited as long as 45+ minutes for a ride. When I wrote in about my disappointment all I got was an email reply telling me they are working on making things better."
1758,LightsWillGuide,"October 15, 2019",1,This is not above their ridesharing experience but about their iOS TOS. So Lyft I’m not going to close my account but I did delete the app.  When you change your Terms of Service in your iOS app without allowing me to either email myself a copy for future review or select the text and copy and paste it into a text editor I’m not going to agree to your updated TOS.  I have deleted the app.  I haven’t closed the account as I will periodically check to see if you have changed your TOS update accept process by allowing the aforementioned provisions.  If you do I will redownload and if not then I will wait until you do.

He was trying to get us to hop in his ride!!! We denied it!!! I’m so glade I can see who is picking me up!! I can verify the car as well as the licenses plate!!! I was able to connect with my driver!! Otherwise things would have gotten mixed up and ended bad!! She was so nice!!! Thank you ma’am for everything!!!😍😘
1760,HottRoddHairGodd,"February 11, 2019",5,This changed my mind Normally I hate public transportation of all kinds.  Recently I’ve been forced in a few situations with no way to get to my destination. Mind you I have two vehicles of my own.  Both times I got good safe drivers that were nice and the conversations were great as well.  Now I think differently about using anonymous transportation such as Lyft.  Thank you for the remarkably good experiences.
1761,bikenblues,"February 24, 2019",4,App charged us $5 when we were scheduled for 30 minutes later! What the heck? The app scheduled us for A ride 30 minutes in the future. Then the counter started clicking and only gave us five minutes to get to the curb! What the heck you told us we had 30 minutes and then changed it to five minutes and then you charge us five dollars because we didn’t make it there in five minutes! I want refund.
1762,Chandeliz,"March 13, 2019",2,"Constantly switches drivers on me I use Lyft to bring my son to school. It constantly switches drivers on me and makes my son practically late for school. For instance, I put in for a ride 20 minutes before my son has to be at school. It gave me a driver, switched it once, then said the driver was like a minute or two away, and I reopened the app and the app was putting in for another driver..... He has to be there by 7:40, but latest he can be there is by 7:55.... this is ridiculous. I get like 3 or 4 driver changes every morning. It wasn’t like that like a week or 2 ago."

Come 7:48am I get a notification that Lyft is searching for a driver. I thought driver was suppose to be ready in front of my house at 7:50-8am. Turns out they notify right before time. I might as well just requested it the same day. Either way I love Lyft and it is a life saver. Still great service and super fast and available pick ups!

I’ve never experienced this using Uber. This glitch is happening to me as I type this out right now and I have no idea where my driver is my app is updated and everything I’ve tried closing and starting my app up again and turning off my phone and nothing works and if I cancel it I’m gonna be charged the cancellation fee. This has all caused me to be late to work.

I’d be much happier paying the extra dollar or two to be able to be driven the extra couple of blocks.

Apparently the hotel moves Lyft pick ups to another area instead of the main Lobby but I was not informed that I should go to a different pick up spot. Luckily the driver was kind and patient.

It won’t save just keeps telling me to input payment method.

However, almost every ride I book has a long wait time. The wait time initially communicated always gets extended, and once it does I get charged a fee if I cancel it. This is frustrating because I can’t often wait an extra 5-10 minutes for a ride that I could have booked through another company or a local taxi I can hail on the street."

1779,meghottman,"November 30, 2018",3,App fail I used Lyft for the first time this morning. I typed in my home address correctly. As verified by the confirmation texts the app sent me. And yet the app sent the driver to a completely wrong pickup location a couple miles away. Luckily the driver answered my call. And was willing to still come get me. But he missed the pay for those extra miles and it cost me about twenty minutes prior to a 8am seminar.  Not a good start with this app and makes Me nervous to try again if I have a time sensitive trip to make.

Also why do you allow your drivers to candle light a ride after we’ve already been waiting for them for over 10 minutes!!! I’ve literally been waiting for some one to pick me up for 30 min going on 35. Which means that I won’t get to my destination until I actually get picked up.. praying that no one cancels on me again. Not only is is a waste of time for us but I doubted I’ll get compensated for wasting my time.

Or, simply driving away from where the agreed pick up location is.  When this is the case, and has been on multiple occasions, there is nothing I can do as a rider.  The only option that Lyft gives is paying them $5-10. Why would you think that is acceptable?  No means of contacting Lyft. Also, I’m given no way to communicate the experience with these drivers that have acted totally unacceptably.  This total lack of accountability for drivers and Lyft itself is ridiculous."

My account was suspended because a driver put in a false claim.  On top of that, while my account was suspended, they charged my card AGAIN, an “inconvenience fee” for a phone the driver never even mailed. They don’t have a number you can call either. All correspondence is done via email. Never again.  Drivers lack accountability.  It’s easy for them to make claims against passenger but not vice versa.  Lyft automatically sides with drivers, regardless. Don’t waste your money on these people."

Most of the time drivers will not come to pick you up most of the time and you have to pay $5 when that happens. The driver marks you as “picked up” and there is nothing you can do.

1818,Bambino001,"December 16, 2019",1,"Terrible service. No accountability I’ve had the issue where drivers receive my Lyft pool request and do not come to pick me up. When I call them they ask me to cancel the ride. It seems like they’ve figured out a loophole where they dry to force the passenger to cancel before entering the ride. When this happens the passenger (me) is forced to pay a few (usually $5) for the drivers time. So to sum it up, the drivers have figured out a way to penalize the requester for ordering a Lyft Pool without the requester having any opportunity to rate them. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Lyft is too big to not find a solution."

Their drivers are absolutely terrible and the estimated times are never accurate. It took two drivers to finally pick me up at the right location just to drop me off 45 minutes late to class. I’m sick of this app and it’s drivers. The GPS is terrible since launch date and drivers are constantly blaming it. You should have fixed it by now. Stick to Uber for a better ride. It’s a bit more expensive but with none of the errors
1824,Brian X.,"November 8, 2019",4,"Overall good, drop-off time not reliable The drop-off time is not dependable, not because of traffic, but because Lyft keeps adding more and more passengers for picking up and dropping off. Even before you place the order you think the latest arrival time seems reasonable and fit your schedule, you should not count on that. I think Lyft needs to make a better estimation if it plans to add more passengers for a trip."

I have nothing but good comments to share about Lyft."

The same NPR story noted that Lyft profited from marketing itself as the “woke,” alternative to Uber. An attorney representing Lyft-related sexual assault survivors spoke to the lack of accountability on the part of Lyft, and their failure to implement more key safety measures; i.e. video monitoring of rides, the option for female riders to hail female drivers, etc. Failing to make a service safe for 50% of its customer base IS NOT WOKE.  I am writing this 1-star review because of Lyft’s failure to protect women, and I am proceeding to delete the app from my phone."
1827,academydredu,"August 9, 2019",4,"Nice app but the first reported arrival time always wrong The app has improved in accuracy. However  The arrival time at the point of booking is sometimes significantly less than the actual time of arrival.  I recall that I only have five minutes to meet the driver but the driver appears to have a 15 minute window to arrive.  So far this has not been a problem,  but if I ever find myself in a hurry and there was a closer driver, I will be very annoyed."

Not only can I not print it effectively, opening in browser is also messed up. I can’t fathom how this could be so messed up unless they are actively trying to make things as difficult as possible."
1829,Geisha666,"July 10, 2019",4,"Good to use but..... The service is good however, I think you guys need to update your GPS because it takes a long time to go into the correct route so the drivers always have to ask me where I’m going exactly because the map is giving them weird directions, or it’s taking ten in a circle rather than giving them the best route to take. I’m pretty sure you guys are getting good money so update your map systems jeez."

That guy, also had no idea where he was going and I never got picked up. Overall, a totally miserable game experience, do not recommend to anyone, lyft drivers are completely incompetent and this app is a waste of your money.

You can and will be charged for damage to a driver's vehicle without your knowledge just so the driver can get a tip in my opinion. How much for damage you ask? $100 plus what your ride cost. Could be up to $250 they say! I don't think it's right especially when you can tell the driver must have already had the damage to their vehicle and they are just using old pictures to say you did it! Unacceptable and hoping for a refund if not I'm going to stop using this service and I use them often. Smh
1834,Wayouttahere,"January 7, 2019",4,"Arrival time Lyft is good and reliable, the only problem was the estimated time of arrival. It was approximately 12:58 and I asked for a lift. The estimated arrival time was 1:18 which gave us about 20 minutes to get to our location of pick up. The driver arrived within 4 minutes and when he called he said he couldn’t wait. Had to cancel and pay $5. Wish that was a little more accurate! Other than that it’s been a good experience."

Why subject yourself to cab drivers who charge too much, are impersonal, and are very rude? I choose Lyft any day over Uber. Why? Because the service is phenomenal! Customer support is always willing to help you out, and they treat you like a normal human being. Do yourself a favor and just drop the cab habit! You’ll save time and money."

I also tried calling the driver to explain and let them know I didn’t need a Lyft, but I was sent to an automated response from Lyft that was entirely unhelpful. Also, the fact that Lyft doesn’t have a customer service line anywhere is weird and very annoying. In short, stick with Uber."

You do know I am not at home so likely don’t know EXACTLY where I am, right? Isn’t GPS supposed to work better than this? It is making connecting with the driver clumsy and more challenging than it should be."
1842,jules8119,"August 28, 2018",1,Extra fees I haven’t used Lyft long but I’m not a fan. My $6 ride ended up costing me $57 because one of their drivers didn’t turn my ride off and drove around on my card racking up money. I contacted help and they said they’d issue a refund in 5-7 days. Their driver stole from me and that’s their solution. They then gave me $20 credit for my next rides to be free. Well they ended up not being free because I was charged $36 in pre approval fees. So for the 2 days I roads with Lyft my account is down close to $100 but it’s ok with them because it’ll be back in 5-7 days. I’ve been using Uber for over a year and haven’t had 1 problem.

1845,mknxo,"October 4, 2018",2,Shared Ride Option I find it very annoying how lyft operates their shared ride option. If I’m the first person to be picked up I should be the first one to be dropped off. It’s very irritating when I have to sit through multiple pickups & drop offs before I get to my destination yet I’m the first one to be picked up. I understand that I can always choose the option where I can get an individual ride but that’s still no excuse for the shared ride option. I got places to be and I don’t find it fair that I have to go around the whole world before I get dropped off.

I would love to have sent this directly to lyft customer support but couldn’t even simply do that through the app. Unfortunately I now have to go back to the almost equally terrible uber.

I love out the way and there isn’t always a driver in my area so I could wait for a ride a end up late or choose a ride and not be ready because they live in my neighborhood lol
1891,2FourSam,"December 24, 2017",5,"Taking my money There's has been several time when I use a Lyft & when my ride was over, I had to pay more for my ride then what was posted before I caught the ride. If this keeps happening I have to delete the app, because that's not the price I accepted before requesting a ride, and it's the fact that it happen more than a few times already."
1892,Mickymnm,"March 15, 2018",5,"Gone Downhill I don’t know what has happened, but it has become impossible to get a ride in DC within a 15 minute window. My ride gets switched three times before the real driver arrives. I’m constantly late even when I plan ahead. In the last three weeks this service has gone downhill in the worst of ways. Don’t send me a nicer car for rewards. Send me on time drivers."
1893,zzddhht,"June 20, 2018",3,"Gave 2nd chance Gave it a second try only because my phone battery was in the Red. Share ride was a NO Show - how hard could it be to find an Orange Chevy in a sea of black and white Toyota’s, etc??? I verified I was in correct place. I was in pick up area when ride Request was made. Paid $5 to cancel after waiting a half hour and phone battery too low. Paid much higher price (lower demand) for another ride request. At least I made it to destination. I think I’ll use Uber next time"
1894,Sherrie T (Tikvah),"September 5, 2018",5,"Riding with Lyft I began riding with Lyft on August 2, 2018 because was a service my son-in-law used occasionally to attend weekly Sabbath services in Georgia. I have had approximately five rides  with Lyft which began in the state of Missouri into state of Georgia.  This is truly a great convenience and service for those who may occasionally need a personal lift!  I have no intention of using any other personal transportation service unless Lyft goes out of business. :("
1895,sweetietray,"September 7, 2018",5,New App Update is Dreadful I liked it better when I could put the address in and have it be confirmed as I could move the pin exactly to where I was. I put in 2 locations tonight. Both managed to show me up the street from where I actually was. Your app isn’t good enough to do what you’re trying to do. I’m sorry but it’s not. Put the simplicity of addresses back in.
1896,ChrisBear73,"September 10, 2018",5,"I Like Lyft While it is never fun to rely on someone else for transportation, it is at least comforting to know that there is a reliable, affordable service available to us all. I would also note that, in my experience, between the two rideshare companies available to most of us lift is the cheapest- especially for short trips. Thank y’all very much for being here!"
1897,WokEmulation,"October 24, 2018",5,"Great app- Idea to improve I think if a feature was added to let the driver know better which side of the street the next passenger is at it would help safety and time delays, I keep needing to rush jaywalking across traffic when the driver stops on the other side and if I wasn’t able to do that in the only 1 minute of allotted time for a shared ride I would have gotten charged."
1898,unhappy rider 9,"March 13, 2020",2,Poor service I loved using Lyft until they changed policy on complaints and refunds. I had a driver cancel on me and pick up the wrong rider. (All within the same day)
1899,kenziemeaw,"March 9, 2020",1,Terrible. Always late. High drivers. This app is TERRIBLE! I downloaded it after my car was totaled because I had no other way to get to work and appointments. The drivers show up high all the time. The cars are messy and smell like weed and cigarettes. They give you people far away and lie about drop off times. Makes me late to work even when I leave half an hour early. Currently stuck in traffic and 30 minutes late to work riding in a Lyft after my first driver cancelled on me 5 minutes before they were supposed to pick me up. Extremely upset. Not using Lyft again after this ride.
1900,DaStrange,"March 1, 2020",1,"No more Have been using Lyft for 2 plus years recently every ride has taken an hour at least to get. I have to cancel and had to make an account with Uber even tho I pay 15 a month for the Lyft plus. I really liked the app but recently I’ve been left stranded for at least an hour. At this point for my safety I’m gonna delete it , I wish there were better ways to contact customer services but maybe since I live in the Midwest it’s not as good as a major city. Either way I shouldnt have to compromise my safety every time I need a ride. Hope y’all can figure out the problem. Good luck"
1901,Llamaman1234,"February 1, 2020",5,"Great drivers! Each ride came quickly, communication was used by phone with any questions for my location! Kind drivers and I felt safe each time!"
1902,nylberry,"January 28, 2020",1,"Safety ?? Lyft has been a good way for me to get where I’ve needed to go until I was harassed by a driver. He smelled me, offered me rides outside of Lyft, and flirted nonstop throughout the ride. It was super uncomfortable and when I got to where I was going, I immediately reported it to Lyft and left it where they asked about how my ride went. Lyft claims to care about your safety but instead of showing anything was being done, they disabled my account. You would think they would reach out or even give me a discount for my unpleasant experience! But instead they kicked me out and I ended up with no ride home. I’m now using Uber :)"
1903,Andy the duude,"January 21, 2020",4,"Slackin Why is it when I schedule a ride, a driver is found five minutes before I need to go, and said driver is usually <15 minutes away from my location? What’s the point of even scheduling a ride...? Also, there isn’t even a way to confirm if a driver has accepted your ride. This could be a really useful feature but it’s definitely not at its full potential and also keeps making me late."
1904,phx kim h,"January 18, 2020",5,"This was great! This was only my 2nd time getting a Lyft, the first time being last night, because my car broke down.   Both rides were great!

I will definitely keep this in mind for any future needs like this."

When someone did once before due to another accident. Other then that I have no complaints with this company.. but FYI you should hear both sides of the story before you just remove money from your customer account.
1907,Mykykate,"November 13, 2019",5,If you are in a hurry use lift instead I had uber but l need it to download ir again and is such a hazle but lift is so quick and it works with you apple pay it took me less than 5 min to download open and account and order a cab ..... since l am still unable to use uber.  If you come form out of country lift is easier to use and install than uber. Save the headache
1908,jackchatham,"November 4, 2019",5,Maps Google is surprisingly off . Spend time educating drivers and customers about appropriate loading zones! And location accurate location. “ my location’ is almost ALWAYS WRONG. Where I live I give the address across the street otherwise it will be a block away and even then it will be in the alley half the time
1909,Tfhgakdnz xb,"October 9, 2019",5,"Joey - Lyft review So heres the thing. To me, Lyft is theee best ride service app. there is never a problem with pick up and the wait is never too much! Dont use Uber just use lyft! Yess it maybe be a couple of dollars more at times but why pay for the horrible service that Uber provides when you can just get all star experience with a Lyft driver! "
1910,bdndbwfTzuwkd shaonahaya,"June 5, 2019",1,"HORRIBLE I have never written a review before which should prove how true this is. Not only does lyft have no idea how to create a shared ride, they also genuinely don’t care about their customers. They would rather waste my money and time to squeeze people into a route that makes no sense than allow their customers to actually get places in a timely, efficient manner. I have taken shared rides the past 5 times now and each and every time I was over 15 minutes behind my promised time. There customer service is a joke. If you have any self respect and actually value your time, take an uber."
1911,Bob46885335786545676477,"October 7, 2019",3,"Better for drivers but pickups unreliable I prefer supporting Lyft because I think they treat drivers and women better. But pickups are often hit or miss. Apparently drivers can game the system, pretending they have arrived at pickup location when they're nowhere near, so they can see the destination and cancel if they don't like it. Also it often vastly over promises ... ride in 3 minutes turns to 20, or longer if driver dumps you. If I'm in a rush, I take Uber."
1912,BooBop,"October 4, 2019",1,"Waited over an hour just for a driver to pick me up This was my first time using Lyft and it will definitely be my last. In total it took an entire HOUR for a driver to get to me, causing me to be 30 minutes late to an appointment. Every driver it would assign me was 20 minutes away, and then after waiting 15 minutes it would cancel the ride and assign me to a different driver 20 minutes away. This happened at least 3 different times. I’ll also add that I was trying to get a ride in downtown Bellevue, WA. A pretty populated city east of Seattle. It should not have been that difficult to find me a ride."
1913,Vtapes,"August 20, 2019",5,Lyft is better than Uber I use both services equally and it seems like Lyft drivers are happier in their jobs. The apps are basically the same. The only flaw and it could be me is when scheduling in advance to change the time(got an email my flight was delayed) I had to cancel the ride and redo the whole thing. There should be an easier way.
1914,wackermantush,"July 30, 2019",2,The option to drop a pin It’s too hard to drop a pin if you’re in a location that isn’t a popular business place or franchise. In my experience both as a Lyft driver and customer the service is most often used on a need basis along the lines of urgency and most times emergency whether a rainy day or vehicular problems which occur in strange places most often. If I may suggest including the option to “ping” ones location similar to the manner available in the top left corner of the more popular gps applications
1915,Aukauk,"July 20, 2019",2,"Unable to Cancel, Hard to Plan We were traveling by air and I wanted a pickup at 3:00 a.m. the next morning in my destination location. The app guidance for this is poor. I think I prevailed, but then worried that there would not be a driver at that hour. So I made a limo reservation. But then I could not figure out how to cancel the Lyft. I ended up getting a call while in the limo from the Lyft driver, and it cost me $10 to cancel. "
1916,popej6,"July 13, 2019",4,"Lift service and payments Service we like, but wish we asked whether we wanted our payment coming off my card versus paying cash plus tip and obviously rounding off to avoid change situations because we were surprised when we were dropped off and informed that payment was already taken care of, and that is why I hate giving my card information for EXACTLY those reasons"
1917,Texas MarcB,"June 27, 2019",2,"I really hate giving a bad review because it’s better than Uber and the drivers are awesome 5 stars hands down until I had a bad experience, but it’s not because of the driver it was the email from lyft. They apologized for my bad experience, I had one guy that dropped us unnecessarily a block away from my location, I just wanted to elaborate because up until this point I have loved every ride I’ve been in."
1918,Sosimpleames,"June 17, 2019",2,Trouble with timing and the scooters We love lyft for the drivers and clean cars.  The app has been inaccurate on arrival times.  The scooter rental has been horrible!  First scooter we scanned checked a different scooter and the number didn’t match.  I was still charged even though I didn’t get to use it.  Second time we attempted to rent 2 (me and my husband). The app doesn’t allow you to rent 2.  So we tried to cancel and it wouldn’t let us calculate the ride and we were charged again even though we didn’t use.  I do not recommend the scooter rental.
1919,msalexandria001,"June 14, 2019",1,"This the first review I ever write. THIS APP IS WORSE THAN UBER I had Lyft awhile back and I got my account suspended due to the card not having money one time. I hit up their customer service line a couple times to get it resolved and get my account back to being active, but I never heard a response. Finally I decide to give them another try with my new email, new number, NEW CARD, (that’s how long it’s been) AND IT WONT LET ME RIDE. Like???? I put my paypal, denied that asked for a card. I put my card, now it’s asking me to put another card on file with that same billing address??????? Wth is wrong with this app. And I thought Uber was bad. Sheesh"
1920,Catnhem22,"January 3, 2019",5,Better Than Uber I love Lyft. It’s a lot more cheaper and more convenient! Always way easier to use than Uber. With Uber I had many issues such as leaving items in the car and Uber drivers refusing to return them. Most were late and time was always an issue. But with Lyft I know I can order a Lyft and one will always show within minutes. I recommend Lyft!
1921,Anonymous Passenger,"January 28, 2019",5,"Wonderful First Experience I used Lyft for the first time today and had a wonderful experience. The app was easy to install and use and the notifications were very helpful. My driver arrived early, was very polite and professional, had a clean vehicle and drove safely. I arrived to work early and safe. My experience exceeded my expectations and would use Lyft again as well as recommended them. Thank you."

1926,broken down in LA,"April 30, 2019",5,First time trip on lift What a great app. Needed a ride to pick up my car in LA that had broken down. Used Lyft to get from the train station to the repair shop. My Lyft diver showed up In 5 minutes with a nice clean car and a very friendly attitude. We chatted as he took me to my destination. My overall experience with Lyft and my driver is very positive. I will definitely use lift again and again.
1927,michtoocrispy,"May 9, 2019",2,"Long waits, no ride Initially I had very good luck with Lyft, however recently I’ve had a very hard time getting a driver.  Once at the airport and once after a sports game I waited for more than 5 minutes as the app searched for a nearby driver only to return to the initial “request a Lyft” screen with prices increasing by $5-10 each time this happened.  On both occasions, I tried three times before giving up and requesting a higher priced Uber.   I will stick with Uber from now on to save time (and money as Uber prices continued to increase as I waited as well)."

I called her and tried to guide about the location, she started to blame me that i have entered incorrect location. The driver is blaming customer for her mistake. This is very unfortunate. I am unable to understand why don’t driver follow gps. Improve your system if drivers find it difficult to understand."

1931,AppGeek4now,"October 7, 2018",5,Great New User Interface I always had trouble using the Lyft app.  I thought it was not as well designed as its competitors but recently they changed their user interface and it is so much easier to use.  Bravo to the team that did the work.  Also the “robot” customer service chat feature is really really well done.  I am now going to be using just Lyft.
1932,bernalguy,"October 15, 2018",4,"Route map functionality Generally I have been pleased with Lyft service, however about 1 in 4 times the route suggested to the driver is far from ideal and takes some quick intervention from the passenger to avoid literally going the wrong way.  I have heard the same complaint from several friends who also use Lyft fairly regularly.  The company’s next upgrade should focus on improving the route mapping."
1933,jbfsaf,"October 24, 2018",3,"Share issues Generally good, but I don’t like that shares can reroute you out of the way from where you’re going, adding up to 30-45 minutes to your ride, even if you’re really close to your destination!!!! This is a pretty bad feature. I also don’t like that Lyft drivers cannot opt out of picking up specific share clients. I prefer Lyft to Über because it’s a more ethical company, but I do prefer that Uber gives the driver a choice of whether or not to pick up additional share clients."
1934,SwampDonkay,"October 25, 2018",5,"Great deals. Great drivers. Pre-gamed hard and needed a ride. Lyft hit me with 50% off to the bar; and picked me up in the Audi. I hopped out, and all the chicken heads were turning. Racked up a fat bill at the bar, and was then picked up by a semi-pro NASCAR driver. This guy made some last minute turns smoother than a newborn’s behind. Never once was I scared - like I normally am with Uber drivers. Not to mention I got 50% off back from the bar. MY LOYALTY STANDS WITH LyFT!!!"

1936,kiKi7070,"November 19, 2018",4,App The lyft app should make it more user friendly when trying to see what time the rider scheduled. I now know that you must hit the calendar icon to see the rides you scheduled. Uber makes it easy by providing a button labeled upcoming ridés. As a first time user I phoned a friend to find out how to see what I scheduled. The help on the app was absolutely useless. Good thing my driver was very good or I would have deleted the app and kept Uber as my only choice.

The contact button in the app essentially does not work. You have to submit through other entrance which is super hard to navigate. When u did finally submitted the msg, the customer services take days to write an answer back. When u do receive an answer, it is useless. In comparison, the whole process takes Uber a day to give u a satisfactory solution. I supported lyft as it’s good for the market to have competitors but now their service just became unbearable."

And had to wait in the freezing cold for 30 mins while my husband drove to come get me. I emailed them and the guy didn’t care he only responded regarding the charge. the only reason I didn’t use Uber was because I was having issues logging into my acct and didn’t have time to fix it.

So I just downloaded this app because I didn’t want to have to walk or board to my bus stop and have to take that because it’s so inconsistent sometimes.

I was told to get out of the car by one of Lyfts drivers because I made a snarky comment about his driving. Lyft offered two free rides as ""compensation"" but the driver is still out there driving. It took several hours to get home. Eventually a bus driver pulled over after I thumbed a ride. He was able to get me close enough to home so  I could walk the rest of the way. If you value your safety, or the safety of your kids, don't expect Lyft to take any action aside from placation. A terrible company and a complete let down when it really mattered."

1958,HILAZYHILAZY,"February 13, 2020",1,Thieves I got into the car BY MYSELF the driver was about to head off to my destination when the app said that I had more than one party and cancelled on me. Then charged my $6 even though I did not have more than one party. This is unfair and theft for taking money out of my account even though I did nothing wrong. Then instead of trying to help me the driver kicks me out. 
1959,Carl Dunham,"February 8, 2020",3,"Love Lyft, hate the app For some reason, even though I enter an exact address, it directs drivers to back alleys and other weird places.

1961,neka251994,"January 18, 2020",3,Lyft is pretty good I like lyft I use it everyday until I can get a car... only thing is there aren’t any drivers ever to take me home when it’s raining or snowing or when I have to be at work at 9am nobody is ever on the road to take me to work... also I don’t like how they keep upping the price when you chose the same destination you went to before the price should always be the same but they constantly change it and it just doesn’t make since or seem fair
1962,sk8nstreet,"January 16, 2020",5,Fun but different Well my experience with Lyft has been both fun and scary. My driver I had to Maggie’s farm complained about waiting for my the whole way there then when we arrived he said he would wait. When I left the store I watched him leave the parking lot. My next drive was so funny and apologetic about my previous driver I gave him a good tip because he made feel better

1968,dojaaa,"August 24, 2019",5,"Cool but could be GREAT I just feel like the app would be more successful based on drivers. I’m thankful for the great drivers I meet but there are some with bad attitudes, inconsideration for mother’s traveling with their children and also communication. Most of these drivers do not speak English at ALL and it makes it difficult if I’m a native and know the place and they’re depending on google maps."
1969,FIUIUOP,"August 18, 2019",2,frustrating Usually LYFT is faster than Uber so I use them more but as of lately it’s takes forever requesting a ride & then when I finally get one they send me someone who’s like 10min away almost every time. It’s very frustrating because somehow they end up Taking longer or cancel. It’s also annoying that I live literally 2 min from my job & I always get someone who’s so far & they take the mongers route & it takes them about 7-10 min. This app is getting ridiculously annoying & is rather just go back to Uber

Could be 5 to 10 minutes before they get to Arrivals pick up area at JFK   So it leads to confusion trying to track your pickup and then the system starts warning me the driver ‘has arrived’ and will leave soon which is not true, they are re-approaching in the correct level."
1972,thisisserioustrash,"May 29, 2019",1,"Doesn’t notify you during scooter rides Super shady practices. Why would the app send you so many notifications for example, when your driver is about to arrive, but they are the ONLY scooter app that DOES’NT notify the user that they have an active scooter session in progress. ALL other scooter apps notify the user that they have an ongoing ride. Lyft will let your bill rack up for the entire day. The app also glitches and WONT END YOUR RIDE. Make SURE you remember to end your ride and that when you end the ride it actually FINISHES, otherwise you’ll get charged $65 like me for having the scooter “locked” all day. Ridiculous."

1974,nicky6nicky6,"August 15, 2019",5,"Nice for the riders, but not the drivers I love the convenience & cost of Lyft, but it’s pretty clear that the company doesn’t not care very much about their drivers. They’re not paying them enough, the incentives/benchmarks change to frequently (usually to the detriment of the drivers) & they don’t offer any benefits. These companies appear to be way too focused on their bottom line."

Well this morning I set my drop off location as Ochsner Hospital Emergency Room on Jefferson Hwy, the drivers lyft directions were to the wrong Ochsner.

Truly unexceptionable, I had to call the man and tell him. “Look every other driver left me and cancelled on me, all I want to do is watch the Alabama and Oklahoma game.” He was hesitant at first because of my area, kinda understandable. Still man, you guys are a service to people who don’t want to get a DUI or even a crash man. Till this day forward, I’m deleting this account because never have I ever dealt with this from UBER!

After emailing to question the charge, Lyft sent me 4 photos of the trunk being dirty (with no time stamp), even though I have not been in contact with the trunk at all during my trip. After contacting Lyft again for more details regarding the damage, they never replied again. This is a completely fraud and I was shocked by how poorly they handled this situation.

1993,nat&dad,"July 30, 2018",1,Charged me 2 times for a drivers mistake! Lyft charged  me 2 cancelation fees for a drivers error at the airport. They refunded one charge but refused to refund the other. The reason for refusal from Lyft was the reason met their criteria. The driver canceled our ride by mistake while we were in the car with our luggage. He insisted we reorder a ride and select him because he accidentally deleted us. We had to press cancel 2 times because he was wrong about the solution to his mistake. It appears Lyft has zero desire to read my explanation of what happened even though I took the time to type it in the space they provided.

I saw on the app about six cars close in proximity to the terminal. My driver came in two minutes. Jose was very nice, picked up my large heavy bag and put it in the trunk, when we got to my house he took it to my front porch. I have had other drivers The ride was smooth and I needed peace and quiet as I was exhausted. 5 stars for sure."
1995,Boxella,"August 5, 2018",5,"Game Changer LYFT has truly changed my life and made so much of it so much easier, from safety to convenience and everything else. I also appreciate that LYFT grew slowly while developing with good background checks and good treatment of your drivers, unlike the competition flooding the streets with poorly vetted drivers just to get ahead."
1996,johnny pooperstein,"August 14, 2018",5,Unreasonable pricing Was pretty upset coming home from a trip to Nashville to find that my lyft was going to be over $100 when it is usually $45. I had to sit around for an hour until the price came down. I think it is ridiculous that just because you have a higher than normal volume that you increase your price by over double.
1997,bre philadelphia,"August 31, 2018",4,"No safety precautions for riders I had a man take me across state lines to a terrible part of New Jersey, Camden. The driver would not turn around until I told him my mother has my phone tracked so she can see where we were. I called lyft emergency support and was hung up on TWICE and they didn’t answer my tweets or emails until almost a week after. PLEASE BE SAFE and carry pepper spray or a knife when riding with lyft as their support staff cares little to none about you!"
1998,Keenake,"November 24, 2018",4,"Drivers that cancel short rides need to go We live a short distance from the airport.  Lyft ride is about $12-13 each way.  We are finding Lyft drivers that cancel our ride reap in order to re-queue and get a longer ride.  When it happens 2-3 times in a row, it means an extra 15-20 minutes in delay.  No way Lyft should allow this behavior to go unchecked and without consequences for the cancelling driver.  Horrible customer service."

I could track the entire journey from my phone seeing when they were dropped off. Loved it!
2000,phun-syze,"November 23, 2017",5,My one and only cab service I love Lyft I don’t think that I’ll ever get on a yellow cab again. It’s much more affordable and the drivers are very nice and hold very good conversation. One thing that I would like to see on the app is were you can request ahead of time/ set the time that you need to be picked up. Other than that I wouldn’t change a thing. Keep up the good work.
2001,cstuart1046,"June 24, 2018",1,"What a total letdown I used to love Lyft. Using it exclusively until things got bad. It started when I was cancelled on 2 times after waiting over 10 minutes thinking the driver was coming to me. When I got Uber I immediately saw a huge difference. Uber is cheaper, the drivers get to you in half the time and generally have nicer cars. The last straw was when a Lyft driver made me wait 45 minutes, confirmed the pick up when he was near a bridge and proceeded to cross the bridge and continue on his night. Also good luck trying to call them, there’s only 1 way to do it and it’s buried deep on their website."

I subsequently used you for two rides that I am happy to pay for.
2003,kay. white,"July 4, 2018",4,Penalized customers when driver does not show / lost Like the service however difficult to reach when a driver does not show up or on time. U pay the price and charged cancel fee.  This should not be the case when u turn right around and request another driver.  Stop penalizing the customer when the driver does not show up or lost  and u need to get to your destination.  Otherwise I like the service.
2004,KelseyBest,"March 2, 2020",1,"Unprofessional Driver drove off without calling or texting. He even looked me in my face as I walked out the door to lock my front door. Not to mention he called my phone AFTER he pulled off and I answered yet he did not say anything. On the app it showed as the ride still in progress. So he took my payment but didn’t even call/text to see if I was ok. I then called Lyft customer service yet the only thing they did was tell me to request another ride and my refund would be in a few business days. Wow. On top of everything, I ordered another Lyft yet it was cancelled and rerouted me to a different driver."

After 20 minutes the ride showed up. I asked him why he was late and he told me it was traffic. He mentioned something about being close to Paso Verde?  My bags were loaded and the driver told me that my ride was cancelled. I would have to call for another ride. I was calling from the back seat and was told to get out, I was affecting his income. Is this the Lyft way? I have been a loyal Lyft customer, is this smart for me."
2006,Lynn Marie 04,"January 13, 2020",5,"Better than Uber I use Lyft periodically during the winter as I’m not comfortable driving in snow. Each time I’ve used Lyft, the driver is ALWAYS on time, friendly, and knowledgeable of the area. I’ve used Uber before, and unfortunately it’s a hit and miss on the type of service you’ll receive.

I did elect shared so maybe okay I thought I’ll just cancel and select not sharing. But, when I get me a driver it would make me wait a few minutes while driver arrived and at the last minute change my driver automatically. Finally after my driver was changed 3 times, the driver arrived at 12:24.

2099,Compton01,"August 8, 2018",1,"No accountability Good luck getting anyone at Lyft to hold anybody accountable ever. Their self-inflated ratings on the App Store might fool some people, but anyone who has used them for a little while knows that they get tons of complaints about drivers being unsafe, rude, or just plain ignorant, but they never do anything to the drivers. I’ve reported numerous drivers only to have them show up again with an even higher rating than they had before. Lyft is just a money machine that doesn’t care about you or your safety. If you don’t believe me, why do you think they don’t have a phone contact line?"

2102,Tf do I even put here,"January 28, 2020",1,USE UBER the shared routes are horrible!!! shared rides are supposed to be with passengers that are in the same direction as you but it’s constantly taking you all over the place to pick people off. that is NOT on the way. I’ve spent 30 minutes in a shared ride to go somewhere 10 minutes away. I have been late to multiples appmts. One time the lyft went BACK to where I got picked up to pick someone else up...like who in Gods green earth is incompetent enough to take somebody back to where they got picked up from. Uber routes are a lot more straight forward and CHEAPER. just save your time and money
2103,804hiram,"December 28, 2019",2,"Just wrong Drivers are taking the liberty to show up at your house to then cancel the ride by just telling you, that they are not gonna do their job.

It’s so unprofessional what’s happening now a days with this type of service. I had to download Uber as all of this was happening and the first Uber driver that got the call came thru and I was able to make it on time, barely. 👎 for lyft."

He is a great representative of the company."

I contacted customer support and spoke with a manager who assured me I would be getting a full refund. I still have not received a refund and the damage team is not responding to my emails.

Also I couldn’t schedule another drive until the lady was finish with the drive it was a big hassle and a headache.

Can you imagine how I felt that I had to drive by myself to unknown place while I am sick! Moreover next day after my credit card got a lot fraudulent charges!

Luckily it was my first one so I didn’t get the charge for missing it, but gosh... it’s like he just wanted my money or something. Didn’t even bother to drive close to pickup 6 at all.

2140,Timera Danielle,"November 16, 2017",5,Pricing Uber is a cheaper app to use when going places compared to Lyft it takes a lot of money out of your pockets. Yes the drivers can be very nice but it’s not good for college students and people who are trying to save money. I was going to be charged $35 on a line lyft for a 10-15 min distance and on uber just $10 I saved $25!! The prices are ridiculous. Lyft will ALWAYS be more expensive.
2141,Hard to the max,"December 12, 2017",2,Cancellation fees! These cancellation fees are the worst idea I’ve ever seen on an app. A driver won’t be able to find me because they’re incapable of finding the blue dot on their lyft app and so they cancel a ride I’m waiting outside for and then they cancel and I get charged! I’ve lost maybe at least 100$ just from these cancellation fees! And if plans change a minute or so after you order a ride and you have to cancel your ride I hope you’re ready to pay that cancellation fee again. Take that off the app. Till then this app is horrible.

When using the iPhone X and trying to exit out of the app it will call a ride instead of exiting out. Have been charged cancellation fees when all I was trying to do is exit out of the Lyft app and it  instead Activated the request button because of the poor user interface in the location of the request an Uber button is that the lower or bottom of the screen where you would swipe on an iPhone X to exit out of the app. Absolutely horrific user interface

Drivers consistently ignore the address you type in and try to find you based on your GPS instead. Lyft customer service’s advice was to contact the driver for every single ride to tell him to come to the address I already typed in to request the ride. Uber lets you turn off this GPS indicator. There is no reason for it to be on for people typing in the pickup address instead of telling the app to identify it by their location."

I’m thinking he was gonna make a u-turn or something but no he just kept going I had to cancel the ride and order a new which was more than the first ride.

2241,famoussssss,"December 21, 2017",1,Charged my card multiple times DONT USE LYFT !!!!!! I stopped using lyft for a reason they charges my card multiple time. I only took 2 lyfts that was less than $5 and they were taking extra money off my card. When i added all the charges up it came up to $105 and i called them to complain & tried to get the money put back on my card but it was automatic voice & then it hung up so they're just taking money off of my card and i don't know where it's going to & why. If i was you i would stick to uber but lyft will purposely take money off your card & im going to sue.
2242,Crazy Heart x6,"January 23, 2018",2,"Prices Not what they seem I’m relatively new to the ride apps but now have enough experience to know that this one makes me mad in the end. Yes, it’s easy to use and yes they give you discounts to come on board with them, but to me it’s not worth it after that. "
2243,CB rides,"February 27, 2020",3,Scheduled pickups This part of your app needs work. I scheduled a ride 16 hours in advance. Wasn’t sure it worked my 1st time. Tried again & app said I already had one scheduled at that time. All the sudden 3 different drivers started to come pick me up right then. It was a frenzy of calls to drivers to cancel. None could help with how scheduled pickups actually work on app. Send a confirm right when scheduled ride is scheduled would help bring confidence that a driver will show.
2244,CoBuck,"February 3, 2020",3,No confirmation of scheduled ride? I would have thought that I would have received an acknowledgement email/text that stated that my 5am ride was confirmed?  It left me concerned all night that a driver would not show up?  I finally received a note at 4am. It was strange because the driver said she had picked up the ride within 2 minutes of my making the request the day prior. Need to close the loop in the future. I almost cancelled and was going to call a cab.
2245,ridesharescam,"January 5, 2020",1,"Ride share is awful The algorithm for the ride share continues to be terrible. Fortunately, our driver, Sadiq knew and declined additional riders because they would be out of the way, in one case at the airport, it would have taken at least 20-30 additional minutes to leave the exit and one back in. Another rider on the same ride was to go off the highway, retrace the other and take side roads the whole way, also increasing trip time by 15-20 minutes. They should do a little more research in busy places like NYC instead of just relying on an algorithm for closest driver"
2246,Phenom-a-mom,"November 10, 2019",4,"8/10 Recommend We all know how uber and llyft can be when poor drivers/humans are positioned in the drivers seat but every once in awhile you are lucky enough not to have a complete weirdo driving you around making you guess for choices and or safety. But lyft has always been a reliable means of transport with little to no altercations concerning me and a driver. If i had to chose one service, it’d be lyft"
2247,CN8500,"November 7, 2019",5,"Great experience This is my first time using Lyft. It’s so convenient. The app is very easy to use, very intuitive. Drivers show up when they say they will.  Great experience overall! I spoke to soon...we should be able to leave a review without spending 10 min trying to find an available user name. Not thrilled with this part."
2248,chicago runner 2019,"October 14, 2019",4,Second day with app My first day the driver didn’t pull up to hotel.  He wanted me to walk to side street to meet him.  Just ran Chicago Marathon.  Legs dead.  In the end I missed my tour which cost me 45$ and was charged a 5$ fee for not showing up for the ride. What???
2249,_carlie_,"September 23, 2019",4,Lyft review The amount of people that you are now trying to squeeze into single rides are not it. You honestly turn most of my personal 10 mins or less ride to 30-45 mins by adding 2 or more destinations that are no where near each other and then also dropping them off first. It’s honestly ridiculous but thank you for always getting me to where I need to be.
2250,KKDkiki,"March 19, 2019",5,"Best experience Douglas was the best Lyft driver!! So helpful and accommodating and super nice. The drive home was very smooth and was surprised how quickly I got home compared to a taxi from the airport that would take a long route and charge three times as much. Taking Lyft always from now on and thanks so much Douglas for the great experience. Your car sure smelled good and was super clean, too.:)"
2251,KB ATL,"March 23, 2019",1,"Left standing at Omaha airport “finding ride” I don’t mind the unexpected. But, Lyft, please be honest with riders so we can make safe decisions. I spent nearly 40 minutes out front of the chilly Omaha airport last night. 5+ times Lyft system went through all the motions for “find a ride match”that clearly didn’t exist. When a match was finally secured, the in-route mapping representation on how close by the driver was were not accurate. Very scary for female riders to be alone at 1am without truthful information. Not the drivers fault... but I will think twice before relying on shared ride services in less populated areas!!"

Twice in LA and once in New Orleans, nothing could be easier and more organized. All drivers were courteous and efficient. All showed up in 4 minutes or less. The Tehnology is excellent. It shows u were ur driver is on their way to pick u up and then on the route to ur destination."

On 3rd trip the car was coming down the proper side of the road and when he was about 1 block away I was switched to another driver coming down the wrong side of the street (a busy avenue in DC) took a while for him to make all the turns to get to me. Due to who I was with it would have been difficult to cross the street

However our interest in going to concerts or museums hasn’t diminished. Lyft picks us up at our hotel, takes us to the concert hall, and then picks us up after the show and returns us safely to our hotel! All for about what it costs to park at AA Center AND we avoid the long walk!"
2257,Crippled customer!,"July 31, 2019",4,"Great!!! I have a broken leg, I’m slow, from a small town, worried about the entire concept. He made me comfortable, waited for me for 9 mins!! After arriving at destination he waited for my husband to come out because I had never been there and wasn’t sure if we were in the correct place, he waited for my husband before leaving a crippled girl in the wrong area! That’s great customer service with a caring attitude."
2258,HAILEY YORK,"July 30, 2019",1,BEWARE of scam Lyft is irresponsible. I’ll rather pay the extra money and use uber. Lyft took 100 dollars out my account for a damage fee that I didn’t do when I contacted them they said they had evidence when all they had was a picture of inside a car. When I sent the picture to show them the drop off wasn’t even correct to theirs they said the driver identified me so I did it and said read the policy. When I looked up what to do I read that multiple people has the same thing happened sad that lyft can’t take care of their customers and their scamming drivers .
2259,badgers18,"June 19, 2019",2,"Cannot Disable Promo Notifications Removing this app and switching to Uber instead because Lyft keeps sending me notifications for different promos and specials. The only way to get rid of these notifications is to disable ALL notifications, which is inconvenient when I’m actually using the app for a ride. I’ve had no bad experiences using the app for a ride, but I don’t use it that often and don’t find the promo notifications worth it given there’s an equivalent service (Uber) without the annoying promos."

Because if you do I hate it!!! 😡😡 I do not want to talk to the driver during my ride. Don’t ask me where I live? how long I lived here? what’s my name? and where am I going? am I coming from work? am I tired? Do I have weekend plans? most times I just don’t want to talk during my ride
2262,DrummerBret,"September 5, 2018",1,"Fantastic Lyft has gone down hill. Drivers never show up where they are supposed to or don't show up at all! Was picked up by a DRUNK Lyft driver, was almost T-boned. And Lyft offered me $10 for my trouble. This is crazy, I've now also been put on hold to speak to someone, and have been put on hold twice for 10+ minutes then disconnected without speaking to anyone. I made it a point to only use Lyft as appose to Uber, but everyone I know that uses Uber has been having better experiences s I will be switching indefinitely. Thanks for nothing Lyft.... "
2263,MooreisbetterMichael,"September 8, 2018",5,"Thank you!! I really appreciate Lyft services because they’ve given me the ability to get home at times when I didn’t have the money or resources to get there otherwise, and then pay them back later when I could! Thank you Lyft from a very satisfied customer and keep getting people home safely every single day!!!"
2264,cryaninback,"September 18, 2018",3,GPS Lyft has to address the GPS issue. One driver kept telling me I was wrong and we kept going in a circle because he relied so heavily on it that he was mad at me the customer until I used my own GPS and showed him the route. He didn’t apologize even though he told me I should get out and walk. I didn’t but it was an uncomfortable and scary moment. Second driver had issues w GPS too but he seemed aware of the issue so he was more accommodating to another’s directions.
2265,BigIG1003,"September 29, 2018",4,"First time Lyft user. App allowed me to schedule my ride ahead of time. The cost of the ride is given. (I took a taxi into my hotel from the Charlotte airport; the cost was double and the ride was longer). I knew what to expect and wasn’t surprised by the final cost. The only thing I’d add would have been a way to communicate with the driver to let him know that I was ready early in case they wanted to, and could, come sooner. Good work!!"
2266,Laraine19,"February 14, 2019",2,"Left at the point of pickup!!!!! I ordered a ride from Lyft. Waited 15 minutes for the driver.  My friend and I stowed our luggage in his trunk and settled into the rear seat.  We were in the car for less than a minute when our driver, Mauricio, announced that he had another ride and brought us back to our original point. The second driver said we were cancelled because the first one didn’t like the short distance we were going and opted for a longer ride. This was very rude and unprofessional!!! I am not happy that LYFT allows this!!!!!!"
2267,iO'h0rus,"February 15, 2019",5,"Using this app is easy & painless Uber is my point of reference since it was the first (and for 3.5 yrs the only!) ride sharing app I depended upon. After several, consecutive, trouble-free rides with Lyft; I feel silly for not trying it sooner. So far, no complaints. User-friendly, and similar enough to the Uber app, making transition between the 2 remarkably smooth and hassle-free."
2268,Opieandozzie,"February 27, 2019",1,"Multiple No shows and cancellations - why bother Have had multiple “no shows” in other states for rides to the airport. Ordered a lyft days ago, get confirmation, then get a text day of “be ready”, followed by “be there in 18 minutes”...followed by a cancellation call. At least this time we got a cancellation call. “we are sorry we will give you a credit for a free ride”- oh ok will you “show up” this time?"

2270,mjkika,"December 8, 2017",3,"Frustrated... I signed up for your $5 off 20 rides for $20 and I find it a little too coincidental that ever since I did, every time I try to get a ride now the price is double to triple the usual due to high demand. I get that happens at times, but it’s seriously EVERY TIME now. So yeah, so much for that $5 off. I’m paying double what I usually do. Also, you guys still charge the regular price first and then remove the $5 off later. I’m just really frustrated with the service lately."
2271,justejute,"December 11, 2017",4,I like lyft have only had one bad experience and they refunded my ride without question. However the app is a little confusing and there are no notification setting except in the default iPhone settings menu. One complaint is the app notification icon never goes away even if I delete the app and download again. I have to disable icons manually for this app and it’s kinda lame tbh.
2272,Marquarius1,"December 20, 2017",5,"Needs work Upon first use, I was asked what should we call you when the Lyft arrives. But I was ordering for someone else. This app permanently put someone else’s name with my number. This also declined my payment information because of the genius who misplaced the question. Who is the Lyft for. Instead of, add profile name. Or add payment info. Or start contact info."

I used the get help link on the app, wrote an email to lyft only for them to reply “Please know that that we're unable to reverse the charge for the tip because the tip is automatically sent to the drivers once you provided one” when I never even left a tip!! sooo if you think paying $60 to go 4 miles is fare, download this app!! You’ll love it👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾"
2278,Remis2020,"February 6, 2020",5,Ride experience My previous lyft driver was great smooth ride and very polity. I left a long review explaining how certain lyft passengers get offended if the driven doesn’t talk and ‘entertain them all the way to their destination. Personally I think that the fewest words the better. Too much talk may eventually offend your passenger therefore getting a bad review. Small talk is great but no politics etc.
2279,eMvScr,"January 28, 2020",5,"Love this app! The drivers are nice and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.

2281,AprilsFo0L,"January 9, 2020",5,In general it’s great - but There is a problem when I have a meeting with more than enough buffer and a driver decides they don’t want the job - but keep putting off arrival time - so I have to pay for cancellation and resubmission. I find only if I call the driver do they feel compelled to cancel so I don’t have to pay. It feels like they game the system
2282,Jen Jen T,"December 25, 2019",1,"Driver MIA On tonight 12/25, I scheduled a ride to work. The ride was scheduled at 7:45pm and the driver was to arrive 15 minutes from that time. However, while tracking the driver about 5 minutes before he (Richard MKP790) was to arrive he cancelled the trip. This was very disappointing because it caused me to be late for work. I then had to reschedule with another driver. If as a rider I would’ve cancelled 5 minutes before the driver was to arrive, I would’ve been charged for late cancellation. What about the drivers? How are they penalized? Don’t accept a trip if you’re unable to follow through."

Prices have risen sharply for diatances that are not so long. Apart from this I have to wait too long because the contactors arrive because if I ask for a shared lyft they decide to send me to the driver who is further away. I am really disappointed of all the changes that have happened lately in the application, I hope they improve them or unfortunately they will have many fewer customers, including me in that."

The driver who was supposed to pick us up arrived excessively early, didn’t wait for me and left me 15 minutes BEFORE my pickup time and claimed he had picked me up when he didn’t. By him doing that it prevented me from being able to get another ride bc the apps blocks you out saying you are in a ride. Worst experience both ways ever.

Other than that service is comparable to Uber. Importantly, Lyft does NOT want to hear about any issues you have unless it fits in their buckets. Ride doesn’t show or schedule, you can’t lodge a complaint. Against a driver sure, but Lyft doesn’t think they could be the problem. I was robbed and the getaway car was a Lyft, sticker and light (off) was in window. Even with license, Lyft refused to work with me or police to follow up. They just don’t care."
2309,Tiffs_treats91,"March 17, 2019",5,5 star lyft!! Don’t miss out!! Super responsive. Was in a situation where my phone died and had no way of contact but this driver waited with no extra charge and even took the intuitive to find us. Very convenient in the situation I was in. Especially when I had a tired 4 yo with me. Will definitely recommend to all my friends. Thanks again Roberto!
2310,SpinSpin206,"August 10, 2018",4,"Air Conditioning Mostly good experiences. However there is an expectation that drivers arrive with the air conditioning going and windows closed, when the temperatures are as hot (80’s and 90’s) here in the summer. This should be a broadcast message to ALL Drivers. When I mention how hot it is their reply is they like the heat. Well it’s not about the drivers, it’s about customer service for the passengers? This doesn’t seem like an unrealistic expectation."
2311,asahbegovic,"August 21, 2018",1,"Worst customer service ever If I could give no stars I would, Lyfts customer service is the worst I’ve ever seen. Did not have issues with the drivers themselves when I did use the app however there were charges made to my card that I did not make myself. When contacting Lyft you can only reach them through email and half the time they did not respond until I would message them continuously to respond. In the end they did nothing about the charges because they never responded to my email- so I had to get my bank involved instead."
2312,Tropical C,"August 21, 2018",5,"Best Driving Service - Easy - Ethical - Very Good! You don’t have to look far to find headlines about the other major driving service using dirty unethical tactics. Nasty leadership at that company.   Lyft has great prices, good drivers and the company seems to be working to build the right way.  Use the company with character, hire Lyft for your next ride . . . and the next, and the next."

Improve your user experience so the above stops happening every time. GROSS"
2314,Artiuro,"August 30, 2018",4,"Lyft is my go to ride I used another service for a long time and decided to try Lyft several months ago for comparison. Except for one instance in Philadelphia where the app changed drivers a few times, which I’m sure happens, we’ve been very pleased with their service. We plan to stay with them because of their availability, promptness, and courtesy of their drivers,Prices are about the same."
2315,LA-PS Rider,"September 11, 2018",4,"Generally great but slipping I chose Lyft over Uber a couple of years ago when the latter’s corporate culture issues came to light. It’s been great but recently their operations aren’t keeping up... identifying drivers that are far away (so I cancel and rebook to get someone closer), dropping pick ups within blocks of where I am, and adding multiple stops when I requested a solo ride.  I’d like o stay loyal.  Hope they can self-correct."
2316,IvyMad,"October 2, 2018",1,Not satisfied I was really late for work because you all kept changing the driver and then I call one of your drivers a female and she was just two minutes away and when I said ok I have to get to work she flipped out saying that she is not getting a ticket for nobody and that I can find another ride cause doesn’t have to deal with anyone talking to her like that and I’m trying to explain to her that I’m not trying to be rude all I did was ask you how far are you from me and that I have to get to work she hung up on me. I paid $9.49 to get to work almost an hour late REALLY.

And they do these things without making me feel like an invalid. Thank you lyft for your compassion and care!"

The only thing I don’t like is that your rating is tied into whether or not you’re able to drive. I live in the south and am black, so sometimes I feel as though I’m rated based on skin color & not the ride."
2323,1request,"June 19, 2018",2,"Extremely long wait time Keep in mind that while there are times that Lyft is cheaper than Uber, Lyft’s wait times -especially for Pools- is much much higher than Uber. Uber at least has the courtesy to make sure users are provided service quickly and keeps in mind the convenient aspect of this business. Lyft will keep you waiting infinitely longer just to fill up its pool seats and even for regular rides, their drivers are less flexible and doesn’t seem to know the basic in and outs of the road."
2324,BOK2ROKJOK,"June 26, 2018",5,"Only way to get around! Being a non-driver, I love lyft. They are quick, and easy to get, unlike para transit services that I’ve used in the past you don’t need exact fair, you don’t have to wait a specific amount of time. With Lyft, you don’t have to make reservations a day in advance! When you want to get somewhere, all you do is tap and go!"
2325,SophiaW,"July 7, 2018",5,"Lyft is better than Uber Lately I’ve only been using Lyft, not Uber. In my experience, the drivers arrive sooner and they are nicer/more personable toward riders. So I guess this review is more about the service than the app, but the app is great/user friendly as well. I’ve simply never had a bad experience with Lyft, and I can’t say the same for other ride-share companies."
2326,navy1blue,"July 9, 2018",5,"Driver didn’t pick me up and wouldn’t answer his phone. I’m going back to using Uber. I waited 25 minutes for this driver at the airport. The app said he was there, and he wouldn’t answer his phone or text. The second lift driver said a lot of drivers do that if they don’t want to pick up a short ride. I was that airport for 45 minutes waiting for a lyft ride."
2327,Carlosfromearth,"July 25, 2018",3,Loads half the time while my other apps load perfectly Lyft app loads about half the time. Sometimes does not refresh while on a lyft ride. This is an issue when I need a quick trip or need to leave a tip to the driver. Message at the bottom of the load screen says “Still Loading” or “Poor Connection”. This happens while full bars and LTE. Other ride apps do not have that issue. Good when it works but lots of trouble when not.
2328,leeloo379,"January 15, 2020",4,"Adding a stop I love Lyft and the opinion to add a stop to the destination. However, recently it seems that the drivers are not being notified about a stop being added and it can cause tension when the rider shows the driver a stop was added but the driver doesn’t see it in their end. Please fix it so that drivers are being showed when a stop is added. Thank you"
2329,staverdhwy,"January 3, 2020",3,My experience Manually put in in the exact location where I was. But the app changed it to the location I was at the day before. I tried changing it. Calling and texting the driver with no answer. When I did get ahold of him I explained what happened he said ok I’ll be there in a minute. Then I get a cancellation notice and charged 5.00 and had to call another Lyft. I’m very upset. This was not my fault I tried everything possible to the error.
2330,Vagal08,"January 2, 2020",5,"Great experience. This is my first time using this type of service and it was a positive one.  Both drivers were super nice and easy to talk to.  I didn’t gave to wait very long at all.  I like the fact that the picture of the driver popped up, what kind of car it was and how long it would take then to arrive.  Very good experience."

Thank you and have a safe and prosperous New Year."

Took 10 minutes of waiting more in the cold and drizzle for another driver. Not a great start to my day when on the way to the airport. The second driver was fine, but I would’ve been better off driving myself to an off airport parking garage."
2333,shawnhank,"December 9, 2019",3,"Time estimates are way off Please fix the estimates. If the times are really this long across all the cities I’ve been to, then Lyft needs more drivers or I need to switch ride share companies and apps."

2335,Szilnan,"October 18, 2019",5,"Helps my Senior Mom My Mom can’t drive anymore and we work. Lyft allows her the freedom to still get to her appointments when we aren’t available. I love how I can track the ride and make sure she is safe. If you had a 800 number that seniors could call in to get a ride,  instead of just the app, I know more of her friends would use it."
2336,Lullaby child,"October 3, 2019",4,"Very helpful app, with a couple issues I really like being able to call a car and meet all the fabulous Lyft drivers. I just wish I had more transparency into what drivers are getting paid so that when I tip I know it’s not reducing what the driver would have otherwise earned. It’d be great if drivers who work over a certain amount could also qualify for employment benefits."
2337,Sillsguy,"August 11, 2019",1,"Driver canceled, I nearly missed my plane What’s worse is that when I called Lyft, they offered me five dollars in compensation. After arguing for more than 30 minutes, they gave me $20 off my next ride but I had to use it within 15 days. This is other BS. Their driver canceled on me while she was sitting in the street after I had waited 25 minutes for her to arrive. I had to order a taxi. It cost $20 more than the Lyft would have. And, I wasn’t sure that I would make the flight. This was a ridiculous and very disappointing experience. Lyft should’ve done more to compensate."
2338,Sir Longshanks 405,"August 4, 2019",5,Lyft driver The Lyft driver pulled into the wrong driveway and as I was walking over towards him he did not notice me and canceled the ride and took off. And then as I was walking down the street to catch up to him I guess it was too late the ride was canceled so he took off. I think you need a little more time for the riders to get to their vehicle. I shouldn’t be charged five dollars
2339,HH&CC,"July 25, 2019",3,"Driver selection and language My driver did not speak English at all. There was a problem with the destination entry and I was being taken to the wrong part of town. I tried to tell the driver but he did not understand. I finally reached lyft and they tried to tell the driver by speaking very slowly., unsuccessfully. Lyft explained to me that they did not have any Spanish speaking employees on staff to communicate with the driver and I should just request another lyft. I was charged for the errant ride😩😡"

He said I didn’t show up but it is not true. We wait for him more than ten minutes then he called me and asked where is my destination. I told him it’s about 40 minutes to the highland park. He said ok. Then I thought he is coming in one minute as the Lyft show. But then I got the news that it charged me $5 and the driver didn’t pick up my phone anymore. He is a lier and the lyft should do something about it.
2341,Davante Wilsom,"April 8, 2019",3,"LYFT DRIVERS ARE ALWAYS LATE AND SENDING NEW RIDERS I highly recommend everyone to use Uber. Lyft isn’t as reliable as they used to be. They’re always late picking you up by driving very slow, going completely different routes and requesting new drivers to pick you up which takes even longer. They used to be great, but now they’re awful. Never again will I be using lyft. If you use lyft, request pickup 30 - 45 minutes before your scheduled time for anything."
2342,bartender Lola,"April 17, 2019",5,Thank you Thank for everything and always being there. I understand about updates for payments but it did make me late for work and I use the same card all the time. Maybe shouldn’t have to update if it’s the same so often. But everything is always good thank you again.
2343,Port traveler,"May 26, 2019",5,"Lyft comes through! Lyft is consistently less than Uber, & the drivers are the same nice people. Rarely have I experienced a negative driver. Only negative is that they are not available in all overseas cities! Couldn’t use them in Australia & New Zealand. The competition with other ride apps is healthy, & Lyft should be in every city that the competition is driving!"
2344,Rebelhearts99,"May 28, 2019",1,In the business of ripping people off. I was miles away from home in LA and a driver claimed I damaged her door handle in her vehicle. The two pictures she submitted to Lyft show no sign of damage I repeatedly asked Lyft what damage is she saying was done to the door handle because I see nothing. Either way I would love to be enlightened even though I know I didn’t do anything to damage her vehicle in any way. Lyft refuses to tell me what damage was done all they do is show me two pictures of the same door handle and have taken $100 out of my account for this lady. So I highly recommend against Lyft.

2346,Open 2 Nu Experiences,"July 24, 2019",5,Great Experience Was hesitant at first but decided to try it. For so long I was afraid and  Never thought I’d used UBER or LYFT. I put my fears aside and Norm was very helpful and a great conversationalist. He called and directed me to the right spot even though the app said he’d leave in two minutes. He made recommendations of local places to see and try. I was VERY pleased with his customer service.

I just want to say he deserves a pat on the back & a raise if that’s something that y’all do

He was still down the street. After picking me up, The driver got lost taking me to destination because GPS routed him to go to airport first.

The map routing api is also completely messed up and has sent several of my Lyfts from unnecessary distance to come pick me up, but it routed them the wrong way and they had to turn around on a random exit.

Another thing that irks me is that they always give me half off rides for my next 10 rides. But sometimes when I use them a lot they just cut the promo before I make 10 next rides.

The company needs to find a way to hold their drivers accountable for canceling last minute. They certainly hold us accountable with a $5 fee so why not do the same todrivers as well?  If it’s not ok for us as riders to waste the driver’s time then it surely isn’t ok for them to waste ours.  I find that Lyft has become more and more unreliable due to last second cancellations.

We didn’t know how to inform any one, and we were too busy lugging our luggage to get there. We had to order another ride.  We still don’t know what we can do to get refunded for that charge."

That’s where Lyft ride comes in providing the need of a rider like myself. I’m glad the Lyft and Uber availability is a great option for a rider like myself. Keep the State government out of the passenger service."

2451,BKWDHAEL,"December 31, 2019",5,"Best Ride! Lyft is consistently the quickest, most efficient, and least expensive ride service.

2452,irritated ira,"December 17, 2019",1,Temporary holds I have been having the worst experiences ever with Lyft over the past few days. The final straw was this morning I was an hour and thirty minutes late for work because it took my funds and “temporarily held” them instead of sending the Lyft. That hold unfortunately was all I had left in my account because I spent $2500 on car repairs and was a big inconvenience because I had just enough money to Uber to work and back home and now they’re saying I have to wait 5-7 days to get it back. Now I have to figure out how I’m gonna get from work

The destination is only about 6 minutes driving, so it’s pretty close. But of course Lyft didn’t get me a close driver! They got me a driver that was 13 minutes away. Not because that was the nearest driver! But because me and the other person were going to the same destination. So I was extremely late because I had to wait 13 minutes to get to somewhere that was 5-6 minutes away. SO 1 STAR LYFT!!"

I told the driver that I was up the street from that location, he was nasty and refused to turn around. Then suddenly I got a bill for $5.39 because this driver refused to pick me up at the destination I submitted to LYFT.

Also I was in a share ride which ended up the driver dropping the other passenger off first.

You can have the cleanest exterior and interior and some people still will not be happy.

This can be frustrating but overall the service is alright. They do offer discounts every so often that make the app worthwhile, but if you are on a crunch for time, plan ahead and order a ride early."
2476,Dsitalo,"February 11, 2019",5,One of if not the best ride-sharing apps! Everybody knows this is the one real competitor to the other giant Ridesharing company and needless to say this is my favorite. Rates are usually cheapest here and riders are everywhere depending on which city you’re in. They also pay their drivers more and give more protection for their drivers which I really appreciate and stand for.

Since when do you make riders walk to their destination?"

He cancelled the ride while outside the strip center even though I entered the name of the nail salon and he could’ve entered to look for the signage. I switched the name of the location to the more recognizable restaurant next to the salon and the next driver found it fine but looking for a nail salon is not that difficult.  I hope I don’t get charged for the cancelled ride.  This is why I’m giving 3 stars.

Some drivers use this as their primary source of revenue?! How can you expect us to wait however long it takes until this slugest process takes? I’ll be driver for Uber until then. They don’t put you through this crap and the fares are higher."

Because there was no road that existed to go where Lyft wanted us to go. By the way. I had no problem with Uber the last couple days. But I decided to use Lyft because of a promotion. But lesson learned. It’s okay to spend an extra two dollars some days.
2521,Legendary305LMG,"May 20, 2019",1,"Safety Hazard Lyft as a company have little to no regard for screening who they let employ for services. I had a driver drop me off to my work and verbally expressed his disdain for my Agency. I am a government employee. This driver picked me up from near my home...you put two and two together. Lyft apologized but it is not enough. An apology did not make me feel safe again. Absolutely inappropriate and definitely bad for business. These drivers represent your company, you think on that. I will be writing letters to corporate. Maybe they will show some concern when there is another scandal on the news."

I kept my notifications on for so long because when I use it I wasn’t notifications but it’s not worth it anymore. I’m just switching to Uber and will probably delete this shortly, they literally never send me a notification unless it’s related to a recent/upcoming ride."

My 4 min ride, which was less than a mile, payed my driver about 50% of the cost I payed the platform. Of course I tipped so he could get at least $5 for his time and efforts.

Then the app informed the driver we were to go back to the airport we had just left to pick up another passenger. This added 12 miles and half an hour to our trip, literally doubling the time to get home and setting us up for more traffic! That is much farther out of the way than I expected for a shared ride.  Also, it was frustrating to go right back where we started from.  Ridiculous!! :("

I am boycotting Lyft ever since a driver kicked my boyfriend out after driving him for five minutes because the driver claimed “Lyft doesn’t pay enough” to drive to the destination. So my boyfriend was left stranded in a terrible neighborhood, harassed and followed by homeless people until an Uber driver picked him up. Lyft didn’t even reach out to remedy the situation after we contacted them. All they did was give us a refund. That driver should be fired."

Also they have the worst customer service I’ve ever witnessed. My account has been charged several times for rides I did not make, and the ones working at lyft clearly does not care about that even though you send print screens and proof of transactions made to them from you account. They don’t have a phone number so if you are trying to reach them you have to email them. Just look at the article about the lyft scam on ABC7 Los Angeles!"
2540,Mona LaMi,"August 21, 2018",3,Suggestions Drivers need to call before leaving. Sometimes the gps is off and gets confused especially in a big city like New York. Also the person requesting the ride should have the choice to say the driver didn’t show up verses the driver going to the wrong place and then the person requesting the ride has to pay a fee. If the driver wasn’t so easily able to get some money they wouldn’t be so quick to leave.

Even with all of the temporary outages on the subway, lyft does not meet that requirement. It's at least twice as expensive to take a lyft line (usually 4-5x a subway or bus fare), and it rarely takes less time. Whatever algorithm lyft uses to match drivers and passengers is objectively terrible, and the routes they suggest to drivers are deliberately inefficient."

I keep running into an issue where drivers accept the ride from really far away, then don’t move for minutes at a time. The issue with that is it costs you $5 to cancel a ride after 2 minutes, which means you’re left stuck there waiting for the driver. Might start trying out Uber for awhile. Think you can cancel rides for free on there if the driver isn’t moving or accepts a ride from too far away."

Although it’s early in the morning and his 10th hour driving he was very energetic and helped put my luggage in and out of the car! He was a amazing ! I really enjoyed his customer service and his smooth driving skills !
2596,CaptnCy,"March 30, 2019",3,Allow opting out of offers notifications! I love lyft in general but I am very close to uninstalling the app if they don’t provide a way to disable receiving the lyft “offers” notifications. I try to minimize notifications on my phone and with this app you can only either disable all notifications or keep everything. I need notifications for rides but don’t want them for offers I never agreed to be notified about.
2597,Nahre47,"April 11, 2019",1,"Worst customer service ever Lyft has the worst customer service and support team I have ever interacted with. First of all, their promo codes don't get applied automatically and if you try to fix this through a support ticket, good luck! Their agents don't even understand the issue and stop responding to you after a while. They don't have a phone number to reach at. They don't respond to their Facebook messages. With this kind of customer service, I don't expect them to hold up much against the competition. I for one am switching to Uber for sure."

Lyft texted me drivers number and said he would wait five minutes. We are walking from our room to guest lobby I call and speak to driver tell him we are walking his way please don’t leave us he responded he would wait. We were not even late but I thought we would be pushing it that’s why I called him. But right as we walk out door we see 1st driver take off. I was charged 5.00 for being late???????

Ex.: What if you don’t know where you are at exactly??

They should never be a fee for canceling a ride. There are so many reasons why a person might need to cancel like a kid playing your phone or the car that pulls up was wreaked or not the right car or they never show up... To be charged for this is wrong. I have had a guy show up on a motorcycle thinking it was cool to give Lyft rides on his motorcycle! Not okay.

I spoke to their customer service and they were incredibly unhelpful and frustrating to communicate with. They said they would update it and now they’re telling me to use the “set pick up location” button, which is precisely what I said I didn’t want to do. Lyft, please do better. This is ridiculous."

Even after manually entering address it reverted back to 18th St. I called the driver & he said he was on the way to 18th I cancelled & was charged $10. It was credited to my next ride. What NEXT ride?  I’m done.

I should have the ability after I book a ride to change the destination, if the driver cant drive to that destination, fine, another one can come pick me up.

If you do not want to pay $23 on a $10 ride, GO TO UBER. I am disgusted with how they’ve become. Stick with Uber because Lyft will disappoint you. I am disappointed with the service.

He said he could not turn down the street but there he was sitting on the side of the road and pulled away when I walked up to his car. The app should have a dispute button.
2668,TBZT,"November 7, 2018",3,"Additions to app If there is a spot to view scheduled rides I haven’t been able to find it yet - would like to be able to confirm what I schedule and to be able to communicate with the driver that picks up the ride. When scheduling a couple of days ahead of time, especially for a time sensitive ride, would be good to see what you scheduled and know that someone is coming to pick you up for sure. Otherwise it is great!"
2669,Jorge Montevideo,"November 29, 2018",5,"My Trip On Lyft The Lyft app worked near perfectly in arranging the trip. Only had to wait 12 minutes for the driver to arrive. He was very courteous and a very safe and careful driver. The only hitch, and this was a minor one, is that the app identified the trip origin as my next door neighbor’s address and not my own. Will use Lyft again when I need a ride."
2670,Dandilion7,"September 20, 2017",5,"Terrible After keeping you waiting, they decide to cancel trips, they underhandedly overcharge you, and drivers leave without giving you time to get to the front door which ends up in a $9 charge. Unless you dispute, you are charged. I have been swearing to quit them but today is the day. "
2671,MartyPaulCombs,"September 30, 2017",5,App traffic calculations are horrible Was trying to leave the area where a sporting event was occurring. The drivers which kept being recommended were caught up in so much traffic there was no way possible they could make it to my location in 3X the time which the app predicted. Hailing a taxi was more efficient.
2672,ELMO OWN3S,"November 20, 2017",2,"Used to love it I used to use this app almost ever single day to get to and from work, however since the new update the entire apps changed and so has the rider experience. It no longer notifies you when you’re in peak hours and getting charged more, you can’t add a 2nd stop anymore, and finally it seems across the board prices have gone up. I checked the same exact ride I was going to take on Uber yesterday and it was nearly $9 cheaper. Looks like I’m switching over."

Y get charged full price for a pool when picking up more passengers (pool is only a few dollars cheaper but when select 4 seats, Lyft asks to switch to pool for eco reasons)??? No thanks, i use Uber for cheaper rates and price adjustments when applied."
2674,chel Seagrin,"May 31, 2018",3,"Thanks for the “promo” These “promos” are a joke. “Refer a friend for 10 bucks off.” Actually, you just get $2 off every future ride you take. $2 doesn’t equal $10, but nice try. Also the person commenting that you can get 50 bucks off is either a driver, or someone working for the company. Just a 5 buck discount, which I guess beats $2, but at least be honest. Can’t wait to use this app to get to the airport, and then never using again :)"
2675,Polishpon,"June 5, 2018",4,"Good service, buggy app. I’ve never had a poor experience with your service, and I always get great discounts - however, the app drains my battery RAPIDLY.

It doesn’t make me feel safe that I have to wait for my lyft with a phone that doesn’t work."

I hope you put yellow cab out of business.

2686,Jamirz32,"November 5, 2019",5,LOVE Lift but... Love lift! It’s almost always a better option than Uber. Just wish there was a way to say you’ve tipped in cash. Maybe make that an option and only let it be recorded as such when the driver confirms? Or maybe the driver just says they were tipped in cash? It’s silly that tipping on the app is the “only” way.

It kept changing my driver, and also the pick up time (all of which were outside of my scheduled pickup window). All in all, the app woke me up before my alarm even went off, and it provided incorrect information continuously until the correct driver arrived within the scheduled window!

No option exists to expose both drivers for one-star behavior or our potential $5 charges for cancelling on app. (We said they could refuse to pick us up, but they forced us to cancel on our end by driving to the airport so we would be stuck with the $5 fee.) Experience was a complete joke and probably converted me back to being a lifetime Uber customer. Be wary before committing to Lyft’s post-IPO system!"

Once again Lyft did not disappoint in it’s incompetence.   I tried to add my standard American Express credit card and then a MasterCard and both times it was rejected. I tried to use the credit card scan feature and that plain did not work.  I guess the software developers at Lyft just want me to use Uber instead. Never had a problem with Uber app or software.

Beats the basic idea of using the service - when you are out and about. Pretty much - every instance of ordering a ride is when I am home or at a place which has WiFi. Can anyone suggest any hidden tricks? I am a techie and have been smh about this one.
2743,Crystalogan,"December 15, 2017",1,Waze is terrible I dont use the Lyft app like that because of all the bad experience I’ve had before. But since they we’re offering 5$ off I was like why not? I waited outside for 25 minutes while atleast 5 cars cancelled on me after 5 mins of waiting. One cab driver passed my building and when I called he put me to voicemail. And another cab driver went the wrong way and ended up in Brooklyn. I’m just going to stick with what i usually use and delete this app forever. ALSO waze is a bad gps app. It makes the drivers do more than they have too.
2744,Ke!!yCakes:),"January 22, 2018",2,MAKE BAY AREA DRIVERS GET FASTRACK I use lyft a lot of the time to get to work and it’s a gamble of if I’m going to be 30 minutes late or not if I have a lyft driver who doesn’t have the correct toll equipment. It should be a requirement for lyfts to use the tool equipment so I’m not spending my entire morning waiting to get across the bridge for double the time and being extremely late to work. If I could select drivers with or without a fastrack I would only select those drivers. Please at least make it an option.
2745,annonymouss,"February 16, 2018",5,Should add a filter for Dog friendly lyfts It would be a really helpful feature to add a dog friendly filter for requesting cars. Right now you could order a lyft and then when you get matched immediately call the driver and ask if they are ok with a dog in the car. It would be much better to have a toggle for dog friendly cars
2746,LS1SX,"April 11, 2018",1,"Poor Design on Payment Choices Had a problem with my debit card and instead of notifying me that the charge couldn't go through, Lyft automatically switched to a different credit card.

I highly recommend lyft!! :)

I prefer lyft, however, your app needs to function in a more user friendly manner and offer a ‘family plan’ option.  I don’t really prefer uber over lyft per se’ .. but their app is so much more user friendly.   I will use lyft from time to time.. but sadly will remain a frequent uber rider ONLY BECAUSE THE UBER APP IS MUCH MORE CURRENT & USER FRIENDLY."

Then he calls me to ask if I’m coming out or not. I said sorry a million times and said I’ll be there in a second I wasn’t expecting you so soon. Then he made a rude comment to me. I said well I’m sorry I’ll be there in a second. He said he would wait. I come out and I see him driving off and then I WAS CHARGED THE $10 fee because he left. Lyft and John in the 2018 Nissan Sentra are trash."

2752,Frustrated world traveler,"January 28, 2020",1,"Lyft drivers have become unreliable Lyft service has become extremely unreliable lately. And by service, I mean the fact that drivers don’t know where to pick up, have stinky cars, don’t know where to drop off, and frequently cancel rides. I have been a Lyft fan and have supported it over Uber, but now I find myself having to switch back to Uber out of necessity. I really hope Lyft can improve their service so I can continue using it. Having multiple cancels at a known location such as an airport or hotel is unusable"

Today I discovered that they don’t share the destination, leaving it up to the driver to accept the ride, only to confirm the address with you, with the option to decline you after making you wait. It could happened at any time of that day, esp at night if the drivers aren’t interested in taking you in the direction that’s not suited. So be extremely careful. Speaking from exp."

There is no place to type any kind of comments. My driver wasn’t not friendly and I wasn’t “unsafe.”  But listening to music for the entire ride that is filled with expletives and mainly the topic of drug dealing, wasn’t what I needed after a long flight arriving at midnight. Wish there was a way to offer this feedback to Lyfft as the driver was a nice guy."

I called a driver that was “fleeing” and he told me that, he did not want to pick me up, and was not going to cancel because it would hurt his rating. These tactics make it hard for me to cancel because I was not about to pay for a cancellation, while he drives in the wrong direction. This is terrible and should be stopped immediately."

I’m out of town so I had to use Lyft to take them to school. Jeff was awesome!! He spoke to me on FaceTime was very friendly and got them there safe and sound. Only thing different is I’d like a spot to be able to request specific drivers.

I made sure he knew to look for the “neons”   My man pulled right up. Thanks for the Lyft."

They even let you know when you will arrive at your destination. I love it."

Sure it costs money but there are promos you should use to make the rides cheaper. I love using lyft especially where I am at is a lot of land and long roads I don’t want to walk a block turns out a block is a mile long.
2767,Loyal Lyft Rider,"August 26, 2019",3,Review App lags a lot. Doesn’t give precise location for driver to pick you up and doesn’t show actual location of driver when viewing app to see how far away he is. Drivers don’t answer the calls when trying to contact them to give them directions And the notes section doesn’t allow enough characters to type in to give them precise pick up instructions.
2768,AnotherHappyGoLucky,"August 21, 2019",5,Love Lyft except scheduling I wish they guaranteed the scheduled ride.i always end up using uber for morning  flights to the airport.
2769,Alexandria N Fall,"August 16, 2019",1,"A driver scammed me and they let it happen. I had a very rude driver by the name of Maybet claim that I spilled coffee in her car when I don’t even drink caffeine. She was extremely rude and disrespectful to me the whole time and when I tried to contact the app about the situation they told me that her “evidence” was valid. I don’t know if she spilled her own coffee and blamed it on me, blamed me for someone else’s coffee spill, or just set me up to her extra cash out of me but it was the first week I started using Lyft and I will definitely stick with Uber now because of it. Don’t let them scam you too."
2770,disappointed2222qqq,"May 5, 2019",3,"driver didn’t show up Not happy about their policy of charging for not completing a ride without giving us a chance to communicate first. Our driver didn’t show up even though the app said he was there. We watched all 4 corners of the intersection. An Uber driver and a jerry cab could tell we were looking for a driver and tried to pick us up, but the Lyft driver never saw us if he was hiding there somewhere. Of course they charged us anyway."
2771,Cstarr329,"May 14, 2019",5,"Love it so far This is a great way to get where you need to go! It’s kind of like having friends who can pick you up anytime. The drivers are very nice.

2772,singer jay,"May 27, 2019",5,"Always cheaper So far, every time that I’ve compared left and Uber, Lyft has been cheaper. I’m completely satisfied. I only wish that they had tidbit info on the driver personalities on their homepage.  Makes for a more exciting ride when the driver speaks for the same language or has a similar experience."
2773,Cry0217,"May 31, 2019",1,Bad first experience with Lyft app First time using the app and waited 2 and a half hours for 6 drives to keep canceling on me. Then a driver called me and gave me an attitude swore at me and then hung up on me. Told me he can’t see details of my request till he accepts they should prob change that too. Finally got sick of waiting n cancelled the request n downloaded Uber. For 2.00 more Uber was so much more worth it!! The girl left right away didn’t have to worry about if they were gonna come or cancel every time. Never will use Lyft again! Worst experience!!

2776,Cavchar,"July 24, 2019",4,"Sharing The driver was great, but the fact that I had to sit in the car for over 45 minutes to be dropped off was not funny.

I will never drive this way again."
2777,MarkB312,"July 7, 2019",5,"LYFT is SUPERIOR to Uber! Always choose LYFT over Uber if you’re in Chicago. The quality of service on LYFT superior to that of Uber. They show up, are friendly, have clean cars, and most importantly never surprise you with random issues (Lyft never cancels, never have family members ride along, use their A/C, and are service focused). Comparatively LYFT is by far the best choice."
2778,nykasdf12345,"June 25, 2019",1,For not retrieving my phone I give lyft a 1 star because they have a poor system of reaching out to the drivers of an item that is lost. It’s been a week now since my phone has been left in the lyft drivers car and not being able to reach the driver. I can’t even get any information to contact the driver personally or even know if lyft is actually doing their proper job in trying to contact the driver. It is already bad enough that the driver is literally a bum driving for lyft and is proud to not be able to be traced California.
2779,Tekhnophile,"June 14, 2019",5,Great App I have been using this app for years. I have not had a bad ride yet. Everyone is friending and drive safe.

It keeps asking me to provide new cards every time I try to get a ride to work causing me to be late waiting for a different company or family to help me! I only have one card and I can’t provide them with what they want because it doesn’t exist and pisses me off every time I try. I’ll even schedule a ride and when the ride is at my house I can’t take it! Are you kidding me?? You have a card on file with money on it, why are you asking for another?? Stupid!"

By the 2nd day it turns out that Lyft GPS told its driver to stop elsewhere other than the correct spot as stated on the app. I was told to wait at an address and the drivers were told to stop elsewhere on a different street!  I was charged 3x for no show!! When I tried to call the driver I got an automated message from Lyft. I texted and NO RESPONSE! Horrible company! Made me late from picking up my car so I was charged additional fee!
2787,csawyer22,"March 18, 2019",5,"Lengthy wait times. The drivers always take up to 10-15 minutes to pick up and if they cancel, you have to wait another 10-15minutes. It can be an inconvenience if you have a limited time to be someplace. Still a better car service than uber in my opinion."

2789,MN for life,"April 29, 2019",3,Scheduled Rides What’s the point of even scheduling a ride? 9 times out of 10 the driver “confirms” the scheduled ride and never shows. You give a 15 minute window of pick up time and they never make that window. I use lyft to get to the airport for work every Monday and constantly have to wonder if I’ll make it in time to get through security because nothing seems to happen to the driver who fails to make the window

I never want to do that again. We left over 1 hour to get to the train on time.

Even when I do have WiFi it still barely works and then my location is completely wrong. They have sent me two different coupons for half off rides that I have never been able to use. How do I know that it is specific to the lyft app? Because literally every time I have to use uber and it works completely fine. I have updated the app and still no WiFi no lyft.

I’ve had great rides in nice cars and also terrible rides in cars that were clearly bought off Craigslist and sprayed with unhealthy amounts of perfume to cover up how bad they are. In the later case, customer support wasn’t very helpful to say the least. Say what you want about Uber but they stand up for their riders if there is an issue. In my experiences lyft does not."

The app for scheduling and monitoring seems sinple and effective. I think that Lyft is providing a good, fair priced service."
2816,Mr.Astonished,"February 20, 2020",5,"Do Not Depend on This App! As this app is getting better social wise, the actual timing is completely horrible. They are literally always saying they’ll be right there but really they aren’t. I once was fired because my Uber and Lyft was super late. Man I tell you, if you want a great report you better talk to your drivers. Seriously!"
2817,Lapita333,"February 3, 2020",5,When Lyft is a no show.... What is a rider to do when Lyft sends a text that the driver has arrived yet they are nowhere to be found?  Call the driver cell phone? They don’t answer.  Now what? 
2818,LLLPIX,"December 17, 2019",2,"App is so buggy Every time, without fail, whenever I take a Lyft, it says ""poor connection"" whenever the ride is completed and I have to delete/re-download it so I can actually tip/rate the driver. I have an LTE phone and I'm not being dropped off in the middle of nowhere. Forget trying to GET a ride back home. The last trip, I had to ask the hotel for their wi-fi so the app could ""connect."" What the hell? An app-base business with an app that only works when connected to wi-fi??"
2819,deered1010,"December 9, 2019",1,"Scammers They charged me cancellation fee and then refunded as Lyft credit instead of sending it back to my original payment method. Upon asking the customer representative about this, I was simply read the cancellation policy. I asked multiple times and I was simply told they can not refund to original payment method. How is this fair? I have had such an issue with Uber in the past and the charged amount was quickly returned to my bank account. I like Uber better and prefer it over LYFT any day. Lyft just is poor and copied everything from Uber."

2822,Naelly',"November 18, 2019",1,Ugh The wait times are getting longer and longer now my wait time is always longer than 12mins and they constantly cancel back to back they’ll drive for 15mins and cancel when they’re right around the corner I don’t get it and drivers shouldn’t be able to cancel if they’re that close it’s a waste of time and money and this app needs to get it together. this happens almost every-time I try to use lyft. It’s happening right now as I’m typing this review if Uber wasn’t more expensive I’d just use that
2823,M261996,"October 25, 2019",1,"Long pick up times Incredible I have to wait 15-20 minutes just to be picked up. On two occasions this wait time has severely inconvenienced me. I missed a train AND a flight. Something needs to be done. If I’m requesting a ride to the airport, it’s because I need to get there as soon as possible. Pairing me with a driver that’s over 10 minutes away is ridiculous. I am deleting this app because I missed my flight due to this. I know it’s not the drivers fault but lyft needs to fix this issue, since it’s happened more than once."

Having your own car is still the only way to reliably get around. (Service not bad when you can use it, thus 2 stars instead of 1)."

I’ve even had it warn me against ordering rides at surge times, and instead would recommend I wait a certain amount of time to save money.

My only complaint is that when I get a car from my apartment they often stop around the corner, which is still the right building but not the entrance. I don’t think that’s the drivers fault but a gps issue which I would hope Lyft would correct."
2835,ijuanmalopez,"April 16, 2019",5,"Unfair A very convenient service for the passenger, but no equal opportunity for the driver, the most important key of a company that makes a huge profit without investing a single vehicle with less value every trip, spending gallons of fuel on a long distance request to pickup a bossy dude for a five minute trip, and demanding special limousine service for miserable 3 dollar fare"
2836,Jabari8585,"April 19, 2019",1,Ride canceled When you miss your shared ride why are we not just charged the 6$. Why are we charged that plus whatever the ride cost was? That makes no sense I was just charged 17$ plus the 6$. I got my six dollars back but the thing is I missed my ride so why AM I still charged the 17$ & this is not the first time. Where I missed a share but what if some ones only commute is lyft. They have to pay the same amount again that’s double. If the person doesn’t make the ride just charge (US...y’all customers) the 6$ cancellation fee!

2842,Mybalancedlife,"November 1, 2018",2,Drivers keep leaving me Every time I request a Lyft from my address the drivers end up in the wrong part of my apartment complex to pick me up. I always call them to explain that I am on the other side of the building and usually I can get them to turn around and come to where I am. Last night 10/31 I had two drivers refuse to follow my instructions for how to find me and instead just leave. This is very disappointing. I’m not sure if I will be using Lyft anymore.
2843,#jbwhite,"November 2, 2018",1,"⭐️⭐️Only sometimes meets expectations I use LYFT nationally, the application itself is not bad, it tends to overpromise and underdeliver... In any business, that is not the direction you want to go. Telling a user that has been waiting 7 minutes for a “5 minute” wait/arrival time, then the current driver dropping you for the next closest driver in excess of 5 times is a total failure. Also, I have a personal and business billing. Your business billing reports are flawed and not delivered/presented in a user friendly version that is conducive to adding them to an expense report."

That really comes in handy. It’s so unique how the drivers have a Lyft glow light on there dashboard for u to recognize them. Very nice service to use at any time. Respectful drivers as well!!
2847,Chimike2015,"January 16, 2019",1,"Customer service not paying attention There was an upgrade to the app in November of 2018 that automatically tips the drivers. You can allegedly turn this off in settings. When I contacted tech support they said to go to settings and turn it off. I provided screen shots of the settings page and there is no way to turn it off. I was then instructed to update to the latest version.

I told them my account has been compromised and someone is using it under my name. No actions till date. I removed my credit card from account and blocked it. Now some unknown guy is making random trips somewhere in country and added new credit card god knows whose that is and I am getting call 2-3 in a day from drivers. I haven’t seen more unhelpful customer care in ages. Definitely worst service ever. I would probably sue for trouble caused.

2852,OGJohnnyboy,"September 19, 2018",3,Great app but a bit expensive Lyft is really great and the drivers are really but lately it’s been getting crazy expensive. Obviously the price of a ride will depend on your location and whether you choose a shared ride or your own personal ride.

First they connected me to a driver too far away then it took my second driver 45 mins to get here plus it had the wrong location for me on the System and would not let me change my address. This has been an experience that has made me not want to do any future business with Lyft. Signed a very frustrated rider 🤬.

They completely ignore this very bad safety problem. Lyft navigation is very bright white. When you drive at night it is blinding to the drivers and obviously then makes it unsafe for passengers. This forces you to use third party navigation so you have to juggle multiple apps. (Which also distracts the drivers, which is also unsafe!) Why do they completely ignore this problem."

2894,peoppen,"March 23, 2019",5,Lyft pick up review I usually always enjoy riding with lyft the o my negative is their navigation system - it is often incorrect - wrong side of the street - not near the actual address - if the driver is smart he figures it out - if he’s not he drivers away and cancels the ride .. I wish lyft would improve this feature !!!
2895,🧐😬,"May 8, 2019",2,"I thought u was better than this Lyft is very useful when I don’t have a ride available. However, today when my sister ordered a Lyft for the both of us, he told me that only my sisters name is on the screen so he can only take her and that he is not responsible for me. So he told me to get out of his car and I did. Usually me and my sister ride together in the same car, but it seems like an idiot was hired. My sister had also told me later that he doesn’t drive very well."

I missed a whole day work because my lyft was a no show but claimed she was there. I Canceled and requested another one and they gave me THE SAME PERSON AND SHE WAS A NO SHOW! They charged me a cancel fee twice🤬.  I got my refund but ever since then I’ve had nothing but problems.

2917,LynnM201995,"October 31, 2018",3,Exploitive Lyft Share is exploitive of all parties — charges an extreme amount of money (often more $ than an UberX) even when traffic is normal on a weekday in order to share your ride (often with at least 2 other parties) and add at least 30 minutes to your ride time. I used to take Lyft at least once a day and now myself and many friends have sworn off. Switch to Uber or Juno for more fairness to riders and drivers.

All the drivers I've had on Lyft have been brighter, better company, better drivers, and nicer people than those on Uber. Occasionally you do get a driver who speaks very little English, and  I hope Lyft encourages these drivers to learn English."

Lyft typically has lower rates in my experience as well, and I like that you’re able to tip your driver."
2922,NerdRedd,"June 29, 2018",2,Price Increase Lyft updated the app and the prices too! They also deleted the Apple Watch app which was useless anyway. I can't pay any more for a less than average service. The drivers are usually way behind time and the routes are very inefficient. I have to give my driver directions every time I get a Lyft to work which I am tired of doing because I want to relax and not be the second hand driver. The prices are now higher than Uber's after the update. Back to Uber I go!

2927,king of the viks,"July 27, 2018",5,Happy riders So after so many bad experiences in cabs in Vegas it’s nice that we can have a clean car with pleasant people that are working with a system that is upfront about cost and motivates the driver to get to the destination in the simplest way by having the price set ahead of time instead of lengthening the trip to get more money
2928,reptarted,"July 29, 2018",4,The latest update The new update is kind of tricky to get used to it seems hard to set or change your pick up location or destination and when I try to cancel ride it just goes to a new driver I’m just still getting used to it but other than that I’ve had great experiences with Lyft it’s helped me a lot pretty straightforward system

Drivers constantly cancel on me or take significantly longer to reach the pickup destination than the estimated. Riders should receive a five dollar credit every time a driver cancels. When drivers drive the opposite direction without canceling the ride they should receive automatic one star reviews or some form of penalty. This is the only review I’ve written and is solely due to the poor rider experience Lyft has created."

2940,musician500,"December 12, 2019",3,"Inconsistent When Lyft functions properly, it’s wonderful. When it does not, it’s infuriating. My biggest complaint is that you book your car based on an approximate arrival time, then it often immediately changes drastically.

2972,FBmessengerNO,"September 14, 2018",1,"Terrible App This app is terrible. I give you my address and I wait right outside. Using the address would get your driver right to me, right side of the street, a perfect pickup. WHY then do you utilize GPS? It is NEVER correct when trying to catch a ride downtown. Currently, I’ve been waiting for 20 mins, got canceled twice because drivers drive right past me. Had a driver call me once because GPS told him I was 5 blocks away from actual address. Stop pinpointing my cell phone location on the map and use the address I provide."
2973,Niqueyeezy,"September 25, 2018",4,Best thing ever It’s really great to have lyft! Way cheaper than Uber is some instances but is really great to have. Only I can say is the app did get a lil more expensive than normal not including the discounts I wish the pricing can be knocked down just a lil. But also the improvements they made are great love this app very helpful if ur down a car going to and from school all the above really!
2974,chris_teena,"October 2, 2018",5,Better than Urber I think that Lyft is a lot better than Urber. I’ve had Lyft for 2 years and I’ve had the best experience with them. Yeah I admit Lyfts changed a it’s a bit expensive but it’s worth it. Well I think it is. Urber takes to long. And some of the drivers aren’t that nice but Lyft drivers I had are way better. I refer Lyft 100%
2975,Mgd14,"October 4, 2018",5,"Great drivers works with Noonlight Ive taken many many uber rides but I’ve only taken a couple trips on Lyft. So far I’ve noticed that the cars are much cleaner they smell better and drivers are much friendlier than uber. Also the Lyft app can sync with the Noonlight app, which makes me feel much safer traveling around alone."
2976,Diesel1209,"November 2, 2018",5,"Prefer over Uber?... I prefer Lyft although the other ride service isn’t bad. I like that Lyft automatically apply the discounts from promotions emailed to me.  They don’t fill up my inbox with emails, and Im not responsible to remember to use their coupon...they automatically apply it to my fare after my ride? Sold me right there"
2977,RumDrinks,"November 17, 2018",5,"Iffy We ordered a Lyft and our original driver called twice but never showed up, took over 15 minutes.  That was on my wife’s phone."
2978,Raidinys,"November 18, 2018",5,"Ray The service was excellent, a little bad began when after scheduled more than 4 hours before, at the time of the ride, they message to wait for 24 minutes, then proceed to cancel an request again and give me 5 minutes wait a lot better, well satisfied !!"
2979,Success Next Stop,"November 30, 2018",4,Security I think that Lyft needs to provide more security to the app. If I were to change my number and forgot about changing my information on Lyft and someone was to adopt my old number and is a user of Lyft and they input the number into Lyft app they would have access to my credit card on file and that needs to change
2980,palarmstrong,"July 2, 2018",1,"Poor service and lack of follow up by Lyft Some how I keep getting drivers that say they are on their way, but instead they just drive in the opposite direction. When I call, they do not answer. Then I have to cancel a ride after waiting so long. There should be a way for riders to immediately report drivers for now coming to the pick up location and not answering their phone."
2981,Passion2017,"July 19, 2018",5,Like it!! I like Lyft they have gotten a lot better and they drivers are better with their customers service so I will definitely keep on using Lyft but I will say this I wish they give their existing customers promo codes and coupons for their rides so I hope they will do that very soon!!
2982,Misalati,"July 20, 2018",5,Better than uber Uber charge u right away once u request so if u cancel u have to go through the headache of money return ... but Lyft only charge after trip finish..
2983,divinetellsthetruth,"July 26, 2018",5,Confusing update This update is very confusing I was nearly stranded because my lyft account would allow me to change the wrong pickup location. Please make this more simpler because I enjoy your app but if it’s this confusing I will no longer be a paying customer.
2984,Theorgkey,"July 27, 2018",1,Never again My lyft account was literally just hacked yesterday. The person got $120 worth lyft ride even gave the driver a $30 TIP !!! Then they got another one lucky the lyft driver called me because they was waiting !! I told the driver i don’t know that person they need to get them out of they car . The driver still TOOK THEM i contacted lyft well there email . Since you can’t talk to a live person which is so unprofessional. They didn’t give me back my money and wouldn’t close my account I’m completely DONE with LYFT. If i can give negative stars i would .
2985,gabbyanderic,"August 3, 2018",1,Omg.. worst experience ever!! Please single ladies with children be aware that I got dropped off in the middle of nowhere with my toddler because the lyft driver said that was my destination and I had to get out of the car!! For some reason the app did not pick up my correct destination so I got off in an industrial park with no life around and the driver left me there even after I begged him not to leave me there!! Omg worst experience ever it was really scary and never going to use this service again!! Be careful please specially if using this service at night time!!
2986,Jennemanuel,"August 4, 2018",5,"Need a way to request a woman driver I’ve always had good experiences but I waste a lot of time canceling rides because As a woman, prefer woman drivers.

Tried calling the driver and the driver did not speak English, he did not understand that we were at a different spot. He said he understood, texted the correct address but then went to the wrong place and then canceled my ride. Extremely frustrating when the app does not put you where you actually are and then won’t let you change it"

A young worker at the Hollywood bowl help me get the Lyft application on my cell.  Right away they were there to pick me up and Joe was the friendliest! His demeanor helped me calm down.  Super nice and attentive! Forever thankful to Joe  and Lyft. My first time using it.  Won’t be the last!!!! Five stars and more!
2990,signedbyamanda,"January 31, 2018",1,No customer service is their customer service They send generic emails via zendesk which is just a click of a button without actually solving or helping you understand your issue. I contacted customer service and they were unable to provide me with any information other than you can’t use our app when this was my first time using the app ever. 😕 they pretty much said they didn’t care to look into it or care to further elaborate what the issue was. I never got this type of treatment with Uber.
2991,MacMac425,"February 25, 2018",3,"Good but incentivized bad driving behavior sometimes I use Lyft a lot and like it, but there is something I think needs to be thought through.  Drivers don’t want to end their streak, so sometimes they will pretend that they have picked up riders and force them to cancel, often at the rider’s expense.  If this happens (and it’s happened a couple times in the Bay Area) the driver should be dinged and the passenger should be refunded (in real money, not Lyft credit)."
2992,Susio13,"June 4, 2018",5,"Drivers Canceling It’s stupid that if we, as passengers, cancel a ride we get charged. Drivers can make you wait for them, show up to your place, tell you they’re here, and later cancel on you with no repercussions. Lyft SHOULD do something about that. It’s unprofessional and unfair! This happens way too often. #UberEverywhere"
2993,Kelz45!,"March 23, 2020",2,Higher prices It’s said that both Lyft & Uber are charging higher prices while pretty much everything & everyone is out of work. I spent double what it would normally cost me to get downtown to clinic in the middle of the day & there definitely wasn’t surcharges. It’s not at the drivers fault but instead of fault of the company to make money off the few riders they get which inevitably puts less money in drivers hand because people can’t afford to tip.
2994,BTravlin,"February 7, 2020",5,Convenient service. I don’t recommend buying a “pass” for $4.99 to get $5 off the next 10 rides. I checked price before then after I purchased the pass and the price went up almost $5 so there doesn’t seem to be any savings only perceived savings.
2995,HerbalDoll,"January 9, 2020",2,"Unfair price adjustment I paid $19 for a ride and the driver passed my place of living, so I had to walk about 5 minutes to get home. I reported the incident and asked for a price adjustment and all lyft did was apologize. They didn’t even honor the price adjustment for the inconvenience. They said unfortunately they couldn’t. I had been at school for 8 hours and was exhausted. They made sure they took my payment but didn’t care that my ride wasn’t completed. Not a pleasant experience."
2996,patrick thrower,"December 23, 2019",5,"Lyft took my money!! I requested a Lyft on December 15, 2019 and they took over $40 from my card after requesting multiple rides that were either turned down or never picked up. I’ve tried contacting these people but there’s no way to reach them. Do not use Lyft. That was my last request"
2997,Cleanophobe,"December 14, 2019",5,"My Lyft experience In general, I have had great experience with Lyft. The drivers are polite, professional, and friendly. However, Lyft needs to ensure that the drivers maintain clean cars, inside and out, particularly inside. I’ve now had three Chicago Lyft drivers whose cars were moderately or extremely dirty on the inside. That’s a deal-breaker for me."
2998,Drick j,"October 22, 2019",5,Fast and friendly Reluctantly I switched to Lyft from uber but as they say first time is a charm and I haven’t switched back to the U since! Always fast and friendly and cars are clean so I don’t know what else to ask for in a pick up service. Highly recommend over the big U!
2999,Lee to the roy,"October 10, 2019",5,"Driver appreciation Lyft works out well for me. Whenever I need Lyft to work or from work and heading home, it works out well. When times are tough it’s always nice know you have a transportation service like Lyft.

When I called lyft to see what could be done about it they seemed completely oblivious and clueless on what to do. They all acted like it was their first day on the job and very unprofessional. Only thing they said was “give your kids encouraging words”. .....YOUR DRIVER HIT A CAR AND KEPT GOING. With two kids in the car. Very unprofessional. Very not okay.

I know not all men will do something but I’d feel better and much more inclined to use this is I could request a female driver.

Aside from that. It was fine.

My driver was great and the app is efficient but drivers shouldn’t be able to cancel after agreeing to pick-up. One driver after having us wait 15 mins en-route to our location, cancelled when they figured out our final destination."
3007,AmyAych,"July 29, 2019",1,"Lyft Sponsored Event Fail Lyft sponsored an event “Polo Noir” 100s of people took Lyft to the all day event. At the end of the event, most of these people were stranded because not enough Lyft drivers were available. After an hour of trying, we finally got confirmation a driver was coming, then notification that the driver was 1 minute away. An hour later, the driver still had not arrived and our phone died. The on site Lyft representation made the rounds assuring people she’d “be right back to help” but never did. The Lyft tent was unmanned with a bowl of candy (I guess as an apology gesture)."

3012,Elimack19,"May 29, 2019",5,Amazing! A suggestion for improvement Using Lyft is very helpful and time saving. I believe all drivers should be tipped. One way to improve this app and the mentality of users would be to automatically include a 1$ tip for drivers. This shows that people in the service industry work for tips too!
3013,Duncan Vermithrax,"May 31, 2019",4,"still dysunctional in the French quarter yet again, where the driver is told to pick me up, is different than where i'm told to wait for my ride.  perhaps this a GPS issue, but, why are the issues different for passenger and driver?  dysfunction.  other than that, the drivers are generally professional, and the app continues to be cost efficient."

3051,PointLomaRealtorPaul,"August 16, 2018",4,"Ride types can be confusing The app is not clear in its Ride Share description and led to me being charged $5 to cancel and then forced to re order, increasing my wait time.

3052,LauraMeeker,"August 25, 2018",5,Missing Multiple Stops Feature It looks better but the app is now missing the multiple stops feature. I would prefer and old app that works as expected than something that looks cooler and is missing features.
3053,Bee Ache,"August 28, 2018",4,"Lyft App The App could be improved by making it more intuitive to set the date and time of pick up. It is too quick to call a driver immediately. Also, an e-mail should be sent to confirm a future reservation. Fortunately, I opened the app this morning to check my pick up time, and saw that I had set it at 10:30pm; we needed a ride at 10:30am."

Lyft exceeded my expectations and gave me a full refund for my last ride ($10) since I wasn’t able to apply the coupon. Great customer service!"
3055,Ryan LM,"September 2, 2018",2,"Be wary of Lyfts new policy on cancellations!!!!!! A couple weeks ago we noticed a lot of drivers pulling up to our building and then within seconds the ride gets cancelled as being a “no show”, which is $5 every time!  This is happening way too frequently and sometimes it appears the driver doesn’t respond when trying to confirm his/her location - it’s as if the drivers are intentionally not picking up the passengers so they can keep the $5 fee — very, very sketchy."

3058,Dahello123,"September 8, 2018",1,Lost item I lost my 300 dollar glasses in the Lyft. After we texted Daniel the Lyft driver 3 days in a row still no word from him. I had to contact their lost & found services. They couldn’t do anything about it because he “apparently” doesn’t have them. Yet the person I was with described the glasses he handed to the Lyft driver not knowing they were my glasses. They didn’t help me at all & I depended on them to receive my lost item. Right when I got out of the car I realized my glasses weren’t in my purse so I called & texted him but no answer. Terrible service.

3060,Meglet99,"April 4, 2018",4,"App is good but can be improved Overall the app is good. I find the wait times to be off, a 5 min wait could be 10-15 or 2 mins depending. In addition the app allows drivers to state they have arrived way before they actually do, this cuts down on their wait time and also allows them to not be at your destination but 2-3 blocks away."

It doesn’t even have a help for this or a number to contact for this issue it’s like pre set up of other issues so you can’t even write a it what it is you have an issue about! Ridiculous I’m going with Uber !

On both occasions the taxis drove straight past the address the first one stopped about 4 blocks away the second about 5 blocks. I called them they both stated I entered the wrong address. Apparently even tho I typed in the address the places they stopped were all of a sudden showing up on my app as the pickup address when it was just where they stopped. They drove off and each charged me a cancellation fee. They stole $20 from me. I immediately deleted the app.
3063,Bobthedragwhore,"June 13, 2018",2,"No cancelation The driver decided, after accepting my ride, to not pick me up. He called me and then without apologizing hung up on me in the middle of his own sentence (I’m assuming out of embarrassment). And then didn’t cancel the ride so I had to wait for 20 minutes and watch him on the app drive toward New Jersey before he canceled the ride and only then could I call another car. I understand why you can’t cancel Willy nilly but there are circumstances that it is necessary. Good thing I wasn’t on a strict schedule."

Five minutes after the driver was scheduled to arrive, Lyft notifies me that my ride was cancelled, and please request a new ride! I went to request a new ride, and the app says the soonest ride won’t arrive for at least 40 minutes! I won’t depend on these people again."

I was charged twice what I should have been charged for the ride, if I wasn’t going to ride with the specific driver.

I ended up having to cancel the ride and then had to order a new one, yet I was getting charged with a cancellation fee for someone who didn’t show up. Also, the first one I ordered was only $27.

Me my husband and kids got stuck in our car and we needed a jump and he took us to auto zone and brought us back to get the car he was really helpful in all types of way. Thank you so much again from me and my family."
3126,djhannaC,"November 21, 2018",5,"Lyft is the best! So far I have been taking lyft to go home from work and even to my dj events, they are safe and drivers and know when to carry out conversations! My friends would always tell me to take lyft and now I understand why. Friendly people. I give them 2 thumbs up and 5 stars! ☺️"
3127,agent8dsgn,"December 2, 2018",1,"Drivers are terrible This apps is supposed to make getting around easier. The only work is if you’re going local. Drivers still dodge airport drop off or pickup, they never show up if its to their benefit. These people are awful. Lyft needs to do something to penalize drivers that consistently doge pickups. L"
3128,akcheeks,"December 18, 2018",1,Be a Uber driver If you want to make money use Uber. When I first started driving with Lyft they use to have prime time all the time. I use to see prime time get all the way up too 500% -750%. When it’s real busy. But now you will be lucky if it hits 50%. It’s such a huge reduction it’s not even worth driving cause the rides are so cheap. It’s much easier to hit surges with Uber and they pay drivers way better. I make so much money with Uber I only pick up Lyft if it’s slow. I wish Lyft would go back to paying their drivers better
3129,Kfree35,"January 1, 2019",1,"New year's pick up issue Tried to get a ride on New year's and obviously there's a lot of people trying to use the app, but I tried to get a ride for two hours and every one that said it was coming turned before getting to me. I believe the app was having errors and giving the same driver to multiple users, which of course won't work since on the driver end they could only see one ride. This was super frustrating especially since the ride was charging 7x the normal price already"
3130,Lakalalalalalala,"July 19, 2018",3,"Great but unreliable service. Drivers are great but unreliable. Been about 5 times now where I plan a 10 minute trip to work 30+ minutes in advance and it takes the driver (sometimes switching multiple times) more than that to get to me, causing me to be late. I live in a big city with tons of drivers. Wouldn’t be a big deal if arrival times were more accurate, but they rarely are."
3131,rubybaetz,"August 1, 2018",4,"Cheap-ish Easy and Mostly Convenient Is simple to use and cheaper than Uber. They always send out surprise promos to frequent users. But the should be more accepting of cash, I understand being timid but trying to find an open store at 3 am within walking distance to put cash on a card as tired server is sometimes more trouble than its worth."
3132,kabro27,"August 12, 2018",5,"Amazing Lyft is ahead of the curve, i have never had a bad driver nor a bad experience with lyft. They offer promos randomly so it’s awesome to open up the app and see 10 percent off all rides or 20 dollars off my next ride. I don’t even use Uber anymore too expensive sometimes lyft is the only service i will use."
3133,LeeLee (Leilani),"August 16, 2018",2,Hate ride share I hate that you have to pay a pretty significantly higher fare for what is technically a 4 person ride just so your ride won’t be shared. The should give the option to have the 1 person fare but not have a shared ride. I will request a Lyft and it will give me a time estimate (I Lyft to work so it’s important that I have a time estimate) I’ll request it. Then it’ll add two rides and move my time a good 15-25 minutes making me late to work. The app itself is great though.
3134,Uni yolandaaaa5,"August 16, 2018",1,Just as bad as Uber If you are thinking you are going to get a better or alternative option you are not .Lyft is just as expensive as Uber now and even without fares . Both services charges a lot and Lyft is suppose to be the alternative and better option but it is no better than Uber . The cab is starting to become better than those two . Both of the services use to be really cheap and now both are just as really pricey. I would expect Lyft to be a little cheaper but it's just as expensive .
3135,Capt.America90,"September 1, 2018",5,"Lyft is better then Uber I've used Uber for the longest time and my experience has gone downhill over the last 6 rides. After Uber left me stranded one night, I downloaded Lyft and had a ride in 4 minutes. After my first experience with Lyft I immediately deleted Uber. My last 2 rides have been awesome."
3136,Nemoore67,"September 8, 2018",5,"Very efficient Today was my first Lyft ride by myself. It was so easy and I had to travel quite a distance. It was so easy. The app was super easy to use and the times they provide are spot on. Also, it was neat to be able to actually watch the trip on the app. Will definitely do again.."
3137,gruehd,"September 10, 2018",5,"Mr AK Farah Ms. Frewione was a professional driver. Not only she drives well but, she's a people, skilled person. She's compassioned, very friendly, welcoming, clean car with a smooth ride! "
3138,SunkoT,"October 3, 2018",3,"Sometimes there’s a response lag It’s fine most of the time I need it, but the app can be finicky. Example, I canceled a ride, but a minute or two later, I got a message the driver was on the way. I panicked, cause I really needed to redux and “schedule” a ride, which isn’t exactly intuitive, I had to consult the help menu, which surprisingly-helped. I hope Lyft will truly compete w/Uber as Uber’s prices have increased significantly in my area."
3139,AP Bio Teach,"October 3, 2018",5,"No more long term parking!! Lyft has changed the way I travel. Instead of paying daily rates to leave my car somewhere, I can get straight to and from my house and the terminal with no schlepping luggage into shuttles.  Drivers have always been courteous and friendly.  Really glad ride shares came along!!"
3140,Swankymoppet,"May 29, 2018",3,"Sometimes it's good. Other times it's awful When it works, it's great. My main complaint is about estimated wait times for cars. You agree to a 7 minute wait for a driver, and then it turns into an 11 minute wait, and then a 15 minute wait. You try to cancel but you can't after two minutes from making the request or you get charged a service fee. This is dishonest and unfair."
3141,BastaracheA,"June 2, 2018",5,Always a pleasure to do business with I must say i never have any problems with the lyft app! I always have a nice smooth sailing ride for who i get with drivers. I will stay on the business with your company and will be happy each time i get a great ride experience! Thank you thank you again lyft
3142,mc2la,"June 9, 2018",3,"Poor Internet Connectivity The last 2x I used this app to go to the airport it literally stops working when it’s time for me to rate the driver & tip them. I get a “poor internet connectivity” notice and it’s impossible to connect. I’ve had to wait for the email notice to come so I can then open the link and tip.  At the time all other apps work and my connectivity is fine. I’ve rebooted phone, closed app, etc"
3143,zetaj86,"June 16, 2018",5,Review It should be mandatory that you get a call when the Lyft driver is there. I have been charged several times because the driver put me as a no-show and I was standing in the location I was supposed to be at on time. That is very inconvenient and such a rip off. Other than that lyft is great!
3144,roseleeeeeeeeeee,"June 27, 2018",1,Crazy unbelievable I’ve been using lyft for a month not my card is -6 Because lyft charged more that’s what it says in my bank but when I go to the app and the same date no charges are seen they also charged my grandmas card to the point her card cut off because they thought someone was trying to commit fraud this is a stupid not very honest app the only reason I use it is cuz I have to for the next to months at least help a woman out and give me a discount if my card is going to be charged for no reason
3145,RRHISLE,"July 8, 2018",5,SCHEDULE RIDE IN ADVANCE LYFT lets me schedule my ride in advance for the next week and LYFT  will let me do multiple stops so I can pick up my girlfriends when we are using Lyft to go out on the town. Some Lift drivers have phone chargers in the backseat for your convenience and also water tissue and breath mints and sometimes a snack. LYFT DRIVERS are doing a great job!
3146,Daveby11,"July 14, 2018",2,"To Uber or not to Uber? Have had a lot of issues with cancelled rides, driver swaps, etc. Last ride our driver was arriving and you swapped drivers. Driver couldn’t take us. Caused a 10 minute delay and we were late for our meeting. On another occasion we were charged for two rides on the same request which we didnt take! One driver canceled but we were still charged. The other driver said he took us on our ride! Hate to do it but looks like I will need to switch to Uber."
3147,ExpMedia,"July 15, 2018",5,"Always Use Lyft The corporate culture of Lyft’s main competition is disgusting. It demeans women, minorities and treats its drivers badly. Moreover, its irresponsible experimentation with a driverless car resulted in the death of a pedestrian. Because of that, I began booking rides with Lyft. I have never been disappointed. Moreover, drivers who drive for both services tell me that Lyft is a much nicer employer than Uber."
3148,Manhayes,"July 15, 2018",1,"Terrible support Someone has accessed my account in another state and is charging rides. The company refuses to delete my account, remove the charges, or address the hack. Instead they quoted the ToS that I am accountable for any charges. There is no way to stop further charges so I was forced to call my bank and cancel my card. Will be filing a fraud report but unacceptable that it’s this hard to fix a hacked account. Even more frustrating that a company of this size has no phone number to call for support. Will NEVER use them again."
3149,HonestlyMelle,"July 18, 2018",4,"Neutral One of my drivers was very rude and another driver sat up and keep trying to talk to me about sex, why I like women and things of that nature. Then proceed to ask me to preform sexual acts on myself for him to watch. I don’t judge the company by those expectations however, it was unsettling. Overall my experience with Lyft has been alright and I do appreciate the other good drivers that I have had."

3153,Wilson berkshire,"May 1, 2020",1,Got fraudulently charged for ride i never called Fee days ago i noticed i got charged for a rode i never called in a city i’ve never even been to. I messaged Lyft concerned about this and asking for a refund and they refuse to refund me or actually investigate it. They keep saying they are confirming i took the ride but i’ve never even been to Cleveland and currently am quarantined in a completely different state. Anyways i would strongly suggest sticking to uber. The very few times i have had issues they have been fantastic unlike lyft.
3154,Nemi.,"April 29, 2020",3,"Good app up until a few days ago. I’ve never had any problems with this app prior to like two days ago, now it just continuously loads forever and never shows the actual home screen to put in the addresses. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app at least 5 times now, still don’t know what’s really wrong with it. Maybe it’s just my phone or service?"
3155,pink_rebel,"April 26, 2020",1,Worst customer service I don’t understand how it’s impossible to reach customer service. I’m giving one star because the customer service is close to non existent and the drivers make up their own rules. I have taken several lyft rides not shared or super saver with my family it s 4 of us all together (a regular lyf ride up to four people) and been turned down and refused by the driver. I can’t get any live customer service so basically I’m just wasting my money by continuing to give this company my business.

Thanks Lyft and you!

Thank you Lyft for getting me home safe."
3161,"LG, Esq","November 13, 2019",4,"A Lyft Newbie Scheduling rides could be simpler. First questions ought to be “Are you riding today?” If response is no-rider should be sent to page to select date, etc. Once a rider has booked something there should be a fast way to change time of pick up or even cancel. These changes would really help riders and probably drivers too!"
3162,Han_Fall07,"November 11, 2019",1,"Terrible customer service With no questions asked Lyft will take the drivers side. Your opinion doesn’t matter, and if you do have a complaint or need help, good luck reaching customer service or lack there of. When you finally reach someone after emailing 10 times, which is the only option of customer service they have, you’ll be brushed off. I’d rate negative stars if I could. I’ve never been so insulted or furious with a company in my life. I’ll NEVER use this driving service again. RIP Lyft."

There must be a way for a driver to accept a rider and then give a more accurate arrival time."

Yes rude, some hang up and don’t pick up calls. Uber is much better!!!! I’ve deleted this app and it will stay like that bc no matter how many times I download it the service never changes.

Great Service Very nice courteous drivers with very reliable vehicles about the app is very easy to use when you order the service you will have a car service within minutes it is so convenience and don’t forget to take care of your driver they do make your ride safer.
3202,SnarkySOB,"August 5, 2018",5,"Great App - When you can get a ride. I love the service.  My only complaint, while not service or app related, is that drivers cons gently refuse the ride because of my location which is only a little out of the way.  I end up forced into using Uber which I don’t like nearly as much."
3203,Not in tne Mood,"August 10, 2018",5,You need to fix the location part on your app If I am trying to put in the right the location it keeps changing it to the the location that you want it to go to. You guys charge me a $5 because of the location which is wrong!
3204,nursevgs,"August 17, 2018",5,"Life Saver I have had so many good experiences with Lyft, one day I had a blow out on the way to work, I pulled over and requested a Lyft I had a ride within 2 minutes and made it to work early. The longest time I have ever had to wait was 10 minutes and that was during a storm during rush hour."
3205,AdonisinDenver,"August 17, 2018",5,"Convenient, affordable and worry-free I don’t usually need one myself.  But my son often needs a ride. They there within minutes.  I like that I can track the ride and see who is picking up my boy.  He always tells me that they were really nice. Best of all...it’s not too expensive either! :-)"
3206,xiaoyu00000,"August 18, 2018",1,"Awful and infuriating. When you are in an unfamiliar city like NYC and need a ride, Lyft gives you literally only 1 minute to find your driver’s car, and even if you tried to call your driver to ask where they are, they won’t pick up and you’ll be charged 10$ for a no show, and on top of that they refuse to refund your ride. Absolutely ridiculous, at least Uber the drivers contact you to communicate where they are. Awful service and awful experience, you’re honestly better off with Uber."
3207,emmyjs,"August 25, 2018",2,Arrival time estimates are the worst Why does it always say a driver is 1 minute away and then 8 minutes later they show up? It’s the worst! I can get a cab faster than waiting for the number of times I’ve had to cancel and reorder. Not to mention the cancellation fees when it’s the drivers fault
3208,mchase23,"August 30, 2018",5,"Getting Left at school My Autistic son was left at school before the 5 minute wait time by a driver I called to make sure he would recognize my son. As soon as I hung up the phone, Samuel in the Dodge Avenger drove off. I had to quickly find another driver. Thank God one was in the area before my son got upset....."

3211,Lashay26,"September 20, 2017",5,Pretty Good Everything is great except I have had two issues with my card randomly not working. It'll work for a week and then it'll just not accept either cards I have on my account. It's frustrating to say the least. Please fix this bug!
3212,Cecil&Ezra,"November 7, 2017",4,"The next best thing to driving Almost no wait- CERTAINLY a lot quicker than a taxi in Atlanta- no parking drama (or fee) Nicer cars than most taxis. What’s not to love? I was having an issue with the app after I switched phones- but once I realized it had loaded onto the new phone with Cellular Data in the off position and fixed it- I was good to go. Lyft- socially conscious, never a supporter of Big Orange. 👌🏽💪🏽"
3213,Gkragland,"November 16, 2017",5,Drivers cancel and change too much Frequently I will request a Lyft and it will say 6 minutes then a Driver will cancel or something happens and they give a new Driver and I end up waiting 10 + minutes. This happens every other time with Lyft and never with Uber
3214,s.glass,"December 31, 2017",1,"Unfair fees I’ve used Lyft dozens of times, if not in the hundreds.  I’ve never had a problem before this, but today I’m extremely disappointed in the unfair fee that I was charged when a driver cancelled on me, despite not calling me, not answering my calls, not meeting me in the designated pickup, and then when I tried to contact support, I kept getting an error message.  There are too many other ride-share services that I can use to ever have to deal with being charged a penalty for something that was not my fault."
3215,FuzzerNutter,"June 4, 2018",3,"$5 Cancellation fee Seems criminal that a $5 cancellation fee is charged when you patiently wait 15 minutes for your driver. All along, you see their car parked 4 minutes away and they don’t answer their phone (3x) or return text messages. Not only frustrating but ridiculous that you get charged a fee on top of the inconvenience!!  I could not find a way thru the app to dispute this charge."
3216,Milah1017,"June 17, 2018",3,"Driver drove off while I was walking to him I was waiting in front of my building when the driver Eslam stopped down the block from it instead of where I was. He was there waiting for a minute when I started to walk towards him. But as I was walking down towards him he just drove off. I’m not even mad that the guy drove off, what angers me is that my card was still charged when I hadn’t even ridden with him."
3217,Suzannemicheale,"July 14, 2018",5,Thank goodness for Lyft When we were vacationing from San Francisco to the Cancun area of Mexico my husband got hurt. He was life-flighted to Miami. I needed a break to get out of the hospital to go buy toiletries stuff and I tried to register with Uber. Uber was kind of confusing to me and one of the nurses told me to try Lyft. Still today I do not have an app of Uber.
3218,Jep16,"May 1, 2020",5,"Schedule Texts I was taking a 6:00 AM flight  Its scary not knowing if the Lyft I scheduled days before was going to be there. But I started getting texts the day before confirming my ride. such  a relief to know not only that a my Lyft was scheduled but consecutive texts starting at 3:45 am confirming schedule, driver and time of arrival. Awesome Lyft Thank you"

Dude was nice and friendly even with what’s going on now and how business is slow and that it was a short ride he still was positive and didn’t complain. Thank you 🙏🏽
3220,nailah01,"March 10, 2020",5,I switched from Uber I switched from Uber. Uber’s app was always messing up and I never got any promo and my Uber points never worked. With Lyft I’m 2 rides in and I love it. I got 50% off my first 10 rides and the drivers are great. I also like that the Lyft sign in the car is big and easy to see.
3221,SRosenf,"February 23, 2020",3,"Ride from downtown New Orleans to Hotel on Feb 21 Evening The Lyft driver that got us was terrific; very professional and got us home safe, not to mention providing good conversation.  He he was the 4th driver called.  The first three cancelled out on us; one told us he couldn’t get to us and the third simply turned around and drove away from us without communicating or responding to our messages.  This is why only 3 stars instead of 5."

Anyhow, not a deal breaker, just that i didn’t expect the charge like this (same destination usually costs me about $25). Maybe if customer is ordering a more expensive vehicle, that should be double confirmed is what I am trying to say. Just a suggestion..."
3223,Kedubob,"February 2, 2020",2,"Cancelled and rebooked should not have a penalty Airports keep changing rideshare procedures, so it is easy for riders to be 5 minutes late to a pickup spot when leaving airport. An honest company that cares about its reputation vs nickeling passengers and drivers should not charge a cancelling fee if you rebook same route within 10 minutes, especially at surge time. After all, the driver typically gets another passenger immediately. So Lyft is double dipping. Out of spite I switched my next rides to Uber."
3224,Frenchgirl57,"January 19, 2020",5,"Reliable rides and interesting people I usually use this service with my husband on his app. We have never been disappointed. Every time that I use it myself, it has been reliable and I love the conversations with the drivers. Highly recommend Lyft!I"

Will call again but will remain ACUTELY aware that Lyft Drivers have the option to decline a pick up! I made a reservation... about 7 Drivers texted they were minutes away and then cancelled! So I wonder how reliable the service is...

I scheduled it in advance and everything. Trying to get customer service over the phone and no answer an eternal hold. This happened 2 days ago as well! Is Lyft making fake accounts and forcing $10 cancellation fee on people or did people really find a way to mess with the system $70 just to get to work!

Rarely have I had a bad service experience with Lyft. 99.9% of my many times to use the service have I encountered a “ bad seed” and on the rare occasion I did, Lyft customer service immediately handle it and all was fixed in a flash.

3229,Barton55 from Colorado,"October 19, 2019",4,"Lyft is the best ride service Lyft is the best service that has come around in a long time. Before, ordering a taxi was always a hassle and the drivers were always grungy deplorable types who always pressured you to give them a tip even if they didn’t deserve one. Now that I have Lyft I will never call a taxi again. Taxi cab is a dinosaur, soon to be extinct."
3230,Runksmash,"October 4, 2019",4,"Good service, with one small hiccup. Everything about the service and app is excellent, the only problem is the button placement. I was trying to schedule my ride but the button was too small and too close to the button to call immediately. Apart from that frustration it works well."
3231,elaine 1955,"October 4, 2019",5,Want happy at first... My first Experience my driver was somewhere else and I am at airport. I called another driver who came in seconds and got me and she smoothed out the first driver. Who I looked in my account and saw a cancellation fee of five dollars which I think that is wrong because I still got a driver so I did not counsel.
3232,philllyyty,"September 5, 2019",3,Disappointed Lyft charged me for a ride that was not completely and the driver declined my ride due to traffic he pick me up then turned around and left me two blocks away from my house and he lied about my where he took me I was charged for a 45 min ride when I was only in his car for less than 10 min with proof he didn’t take me anywhere and caused a lot of problems

3237,barbieri1,"July 22, 2019",3,"Shared routes are not efficient While I love Lyft, the shared rides have been horribly inefficient lately. It seems like every ride I get in, I am picked up, the rider starts to head toward my destination, and then turns around and goes in the opposite direction to pick up the next passenger. Living in San Francisco, there are so many people requesting rides that I don’t see a need for this and think the routes could be much more efficient"
3238,Edge of Bed,"July 2, 2019",5,"Amazing Service - I’m a believer! The service and price are both great, and the driver was engaging as well as knowledgeable.  I would normally go with Uber but found that only Lyft would permit me to schedule pick-up the night before. If I had only known, I’d have gone with Lyft as my first choice, and I will from now on!"

From the time i made the request to the time the driver was available was about 2 minutes. Robert was an excellent driver and traffic was terrible. I highly recommend Lyft over other ground transportation.

3249,mitcheyf,"June 12, 2019",5,Lyft is better than Uber. I have been using Lyft since I was in an accident a few weeks ago. The prices are better. The fact that you can always schedule rides unlike Uber where there has to be a driver in the area that does schedule rides is huge.
3250,Grushenka27,"December 14, 2018",5,"My first Lyft It was so easy. The driver arrived in 1 minute! The hardest part was recognizing the car.

I asked for a refund because I got out of the cab and didn’t complete my ride to destination but they claimed because it was already computed there was nothing they could do anymore.

Most of the time it seems the LYFT driver is understanding.  But I really wish there was a way to let them know they are picking up a senior and it might be a little more time consuming. But IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH MORE if they do give a little time and patience. LYFT could be so much more!
3262,ChilGirl,"September 20, 2018",1,Too many dishonest drivers I’ve been burned too often by dishonest Lyft drivers. Drivers that don’t show up but mark their arrival and then don’t bother to cancel the ride so I’m left standing at the curb for 20 min AND charged $5 for cancelling a ride.

In the past, you set your location and then your destination. Now it is reversed like Uber. It’s super counter intuitive and also requires more clicks. It also does one of my least favorite app things: the super casual voice. Instead of just saying destination, it says “TGIF where are you going?”. What if I was going to a funeral or the hospital? Apps like Lyft should have a neutral voice like the previous version."

What do I do to pre schedule a ride and how to I add an additional stop? 
3281,dans45,"February 18, 2018",1,Drivers will scam you!! Put in different drop off point after dropping us off!! My driver had not finished the ride after dropping us off at our destination and charged us $35 more than what it should have. We have tried to reach out to Lyft multiple times to review this ride and on our ride history you can clearly see our destination but then it was changed right after that. Why Lyft won’t reach back out to us after  this horrible experience is nothing more than a robbery.
3282,WhatTheRussian,"March 20, 2018",2,Great app for waiting If you do not want to wait for someone else to be dropped off before your driver comes to you... do not get this app. 70% of the time you will be matched with someone who already has a passenger and your forced to wait/watch other people being dropped off. Frustrating if your running late. 30% of the time you will match with someone who doesn’t have a rider but the wait time will be around 15min-20 so keep that in mind.
3283,jalissa o.,"May 22, 2018",5,Horrible navigation system they use. Your drivers always pick you up in the wrong locations and have nerve to start a ride when you’re not even in the vehicle yet ! Then you request a refund and lyft doesn’t want to give it to you ! Haha what a joke. Stick with Uber y’all !
3284,Jenniez 2471,"May 23, 2018",5,"New Customer I previously had been using Huber, I decided to give Lyft a try to see if there was a difference. The drivers seem very friendly and respectful. In both so far. However, with Lyft I can have a car within 5 minutes! I will definitely continue using Lyft!"
3285,surebutnotsosure,"May 31, 2018",3,Prefer to Uber Always choose this app to Uber but probably won’t take a lyft ride in awhile. Reached out to their support staff twice about an unsafe vehicle and a driver saying they were a Plus but only had seats for 4. A bit disappointed but ultimately will probably take a lyft again. It’s muni again for me. I myself work in support so understand the challenges/complaints but wish at least regarding safety they’d respond.
3286,Z. Neary,"June 4, 2018",5,Definitely a Lyft User Now Was able to schedule a ride the night before and had confirmation of the ride an hour before and when the driver was in route. Definitely a reliable source of transportation and will use again.

3290,JMSlaght,"October 7, 2017",5,"Easy and Cost Effective Having been using Lyft for approximately 6 months, every ride has been a 5 Star-quality, very safe ride. Each ride is very cheap and there are constantly promos to use. The drivers make conversation light and get you where you need to go fast and safely."
3291,Evan S Parker,"October 21, 2017",2,"One for two on the app working Worked once, but this time I tried to call a ride, and it stayed on the looking for rides screen with the radar pings for a few minutes. Tried to cancel the ride, and then it said someone was on their way. "

DO NOT DOWNLOAD I ordered a lyft was sitting in the car next thing i know they said thanks for riding with lyft etc while i am sitting in the car while i didn’t even get to my location. The trip was supposed to last 21 min but the driver kept on picking up other people. I had to get off the car cause there was no point in staying since i was supposedly at my destination. I had to order an uber to where i was going. On top of that i tried to email them contact then. I still haven’t get any response form them.
3293,Edwin Mani,"March 9, 2020",3,Hard to connect Why is it so hard to find a Lyft around me now. I feel like there are less and less riders around my area now. I use this app almost everyday to get to work and now I have to keep on leaving earlier and easier because each rider I connect with is further and further. I wish there was a way for you to be able to connect to a closer driver
3294,Luckyducky170,"March 5, 2020",5,"Next best thing. So I scheduled a ride from Uber the night before and it got cancelled due to a 4x higher rate the next day ($10 ride went to a $40 ride). I got into the Lyft App and got a replacement ride within minutes for only $9.50!! What??!!! Going forward, I will ALWAYS try Lyft first and will ALWAYS recommend Lyft!"
3295,Queststarr,"March 3, 2020",2,Driver stole my iPhone The Driver never replied and apparently was unreachable by the company for days? This was my corporate device and I find it odd that this person was so unreachable when I contacted the company and the driver no later than 25 mins from his drop time at my address. My entire workweek in shambles with missed calls and loss of personal information. I have wanted so badly to report the driver to the police I have his photo and LC# when an innocent follow up would negate this?
3296,KeepItDisney,"February 23, 2020",5,"Very Convenient. Wish prices were consistent. We take the same route often ( sometimes on each other’s accounts) and prices differ by up to $5. Wish price points matched up. Also, would like to have “Non smoker” driver as an option. 😌"
3297,Steve Whyte,"February 15, 2020",2,"Too long to get to us. I chose Lyft over Uber because the price was much better. Now I know why, 2 previous rides decided they did not want the fare so Lyft kept changing drivers at the last minute. We were lucky to get Edmond, who drove 10 minutes away to pick us up. Meanwhile Uber drivers were showing up at the same pickup point within, 6 minutes without changing drivers. Now I know why the fare is lower, can’t get a driver."
3298,5783926,"January 29, 2020",5,Excellent ap  & service. My first Lyft.   Whole process was very smooth including 3:30am when I couldn’t sleep worrying if my ride would actually come and I get text reminder that ‘yes’ I’m on their schedule.  I actually slept then.  Ap was really easy and helpful; driver prompt and friendly.  Great experience.
3299,Nickgurl_,"January 27, 2020",5,I recommend it over Uber ! Been using Lyft while my vehicle is in the shop. I really like that you can leave a message to your driver. Sometimes there is a language barrier with some drivers and it makes it difficult to meet. But it’s mostly cool! And like half price of uber!
3300,levee lover,"January 6, 2020",4,Like the drivers App needs work Tendency for app to change drivers after assignment is annoying. Providing feedback is hard to do (other than a few items that never fit the reason I’m reaching out). Setting pickup with pin drop is hard to get to.  No way to set a pickup time that I have found.
3301,Raychelle Hawkins,"December 12, 2019",4,Needs better location service The app is good but the location could be better on several occasions I have been somewhere and the driver said they could not locate me however I can only use the location Lyft gives them and no matter how close the driver is the app always s3 mins away
3302,DPetrushka,"December 2, 2019",1,"Lyft drivers complain about my drop off I love lyft and I’ve been a long time user, but as a customer I hate getting into the car and having my driver upset about having to drive in a direction they don’t want to travel in."

3304,Mazzzterrsssssds5555,"November 26, 2019",5,It’s better than competitors Honestly lyft is a good service. Only problem is at times it’s mapping is off when it comes to finding your driver or even where their current location is but that has bettered over the times of me using it.
3305,Kimberly ~~ B,"November 17, 2019",5,Good but could be improved A suggested option to be added to the app on each ride &/or on the rider’s profile is what type of ride would you like: 
3306,Panamena7,"November 17, 2019",5,"William was a great, friendly driver We handed him a cash tip, so please don’t look at the  ‘no tip added’. He was great!!

William somehow, found him and brought us both back to the Residence Inn. Thank you, Will!"
3307,mh_ny,"November 1, 2019",2,"Search bar needs to list closest options first Often there are multiple destinations matching my search term. The app search bar needs to list the closest option matching the search term first. It’s a pain to scroll down clicking on each matching term to see which is the closest eg “chase bank” “Utica Ave subway” etc. If you are in a rush it’s easy to see what you’re searching for, click it and not realize Lyft is planning to take you elsewhere"
3308,Mario Lovett,"October 22, 2019",1,"Over charged I’ve been riding Lyft now for about 2months now straight 5-6 days a week to the same place, and my price went from  around $7-8 dollars with this 20 percent discount for 10 rides, then after my price went to 10 dollar going the same place, then went to 11 and half dollars, going the same place, which now is about 13 dollars, and now I feel ripped off and feel like the price keep increasing? Why does the price keep increasing and I’m going to the EXACT SAME PLACE! Please explain why is that!!!!!!"

3310,Sum F3gi+,"October 16, 2019",4,"Recent Use Review As a user, the Lyft app has been reliable for most uses. The price is often better than Uber as well.

I have used Uber weekly for the past 3 years but I got a new credit card and had to change it in the Uber system and because i went in the system 3 times it increased my price each request. So i decided to try lyft. I am now changing. Great job!!!
3315,Bloggin the Bugg,"September 2, 2019",5,"Makes transportation easy! Lyft is my go-to now. I’ve used other services and recently took a cab, which was horrible.

3316,LamileyLpve,"August 10, 2019",4,"Price The price of my Lyft went high I’m not sure why. When I have promos the promos don’t give me a cost savings at all. I’ll sometimes stand next to my friends and when they order through Lyft it’s cheaper but when I do it, it’s more expensive. For me the competitors price is almost always cheaper so I haven’t been using it as much."
3317,dannak,"July 30, 2019",5,Better than Uber from what I heard I only had one issue with Lyft and that was when I was denied service because of my race but that problem was resolved swiftly. And other than a couple of waits of more than 5 minutes I’ve really had no problems.
3318,Jajsgjsk185,"July 28, 2019",3,"Pros and cons You can’t cancel a drive on your end without being charged $5. I had a lady doing circles in the wrong area. Wouldn’t answer my calls or texts, and I needed to make a flight. Had to wait 20 mins before canceling and having to pay the fee, since she refused to answer or do it from her end. "
3319,Pregosocal,"July 17, 2019",1,Poor pickup estimates and bad customer service Their algorithm is really off with pickup estimates and wait times are regularly much longer than the original provided.  Lately car quality is way down so their screening process has fallen apart. Also got overcharged for a ride and no apology when I was upset that it happened. They told me in so many words to go away and only contact them in the future if I had something nice to say about them. What sort of weird customer service is that?

I can see the drivers were around me. But lyft just end my request without a single reason showing to me. One ride was scheduled to airport and I had already wait 10 min for the driver. I almost missed my flight because I need to use other way to go to the airport after waiting unnecessary time. Goodbye lyft I will delete you forever and use Uber instead. Wish you good stock!"
3321,Outlandiekf,"April 22, 2019",3,Late I have gotten times when the driver never came!!! Like twice! With this app while waiting for the driver. This time it told me i would be at work by 1 and that I would only wait 5 minutes till the driver came. I had to wait more than that and the time to get to there was ten minutes later than the app actually said! Never had this problem with Uber.

3323,Uriaah Heep,"April 29, 2019",5,See all charges You should allow me to see all charges prior to choosing a tip amount. I should NOT be tipping and tax or surcharges included. That's a bad business model to follow. You force me to choose 15% because I don't see what fees are included. Love the rides. Hate not being transparent as to what I'm paying.

Not sure what’s going on but moved to Lyft a few months ago and very happy with your drivers and your platform.  Keep your drivers happy and take care of them.  They have all said good things about working for you!

They hate their job. Happy drivers=happy customers. Look at your reviews. Drivers leave people hanging trying to collect every single dollar that you cut from their pay. So people like me are stuck with a driver that doesn't show up Or parks across the street and lets the timer run out. Your lack of morals  has me paying for rides i never took because the drivers are always mad.

The assigned driver was two minutes away from my pickup location and the system found another driver for me with an arrival time of 9 plus minutes.  This driver could not find my location (tracking showed he was two minutes from arrival).  I got a third an a fourth driver.  All this added more than 30 mins to my pickup time.  Not the best customer experience.

It was accepted and assigned to a driver ( a person took responsibility for that ride ) on the day of my trip, it was cancelled by the driver and lyft automatically put it up for grabs. It was then picked up by a women named Audrea, she was 15 minutes out and then around 12 minutes later I hear the tone telling me my ride was re assigned...... almost missed my flight never using this stupid app ever again."

Keep improving Lyft!

I’ve had time ranges change wildly that do not make sense for how far away the driver or location is. From 4 mins changing to 6 mins then 10 mins and getting higher. Just give me the long wait time upfront versus messing with me! Every time this happens, I silently scream to myself, “Why is Lyft lying?”"
3363,blaireh1,"July 27, 2018",4,Like! I had to cancel a few trips because it kept getting my location wrong which was annoying but when I contacted them via Twitter messages they said they would remove the cancellation fee. I didn’t mind paying the fee but nice they were able to remove it. After a hectic day that helps
3364,Oowieowow,"July 28, 2018",5,"Always changes the time If u wanna use this as transportation to work I would not recommend. I’ll order a lyft and it will say 8 mins , then change to 11 mins , then change the driver and make me wait longer, it’s just never accurate with time at all"
3365,Death Puppet,"July 31, 2018",5,"Good prices, nice drivers I like using Lyft.  I used to think that I would hail the ride immediately if I went through entering the destination process, but the app will first let you know the price before it calls the ride for you.  Their prices are very good, and the drivers have been very nice."

Your driver either don’t come to my location They cancel on me and I have to wait I can’t find a driver or he’ll give me one driver in the middle of my ride or waiting for my ride to have theme switch the driver  in the middle me waiting. I’m not a happy customer
3367,boogienightout,"August 8, 2018",5,Too expensive I’ve noticed that I get charged more for rides than my friends do. I’m not sure how you do the pricing but it’s odd that two people in the same place could be going to the same location and would have two different prices.

Doesn’t show the requests under notifications either. All were during the ride as well so that wasn’t the issue. I even turned off WiFi so it used my data plan to open the split ride request in the app but still, nothing. I have screen shots showing the experience if they’re needed."
3371,Sxypony,"December 13, 2017",5,Decent..... I normally use Uber. But i tried Lyft because i got a free coupon. It’s cheaper BUT it’s because they pick up several other people with you. So basically i was late going to my destination because we had to make SEVERAL additional stops. ONLY use if time isn’t a factor.
3372,Twin9000,"January 4, 2018",5,Back track?! It’s really frustrating when you’re half way to your destination and another rider is added to your ride that is a block away from where you were just picked up. How is back tracking 10min or more the most economical?
3373,TumTiff,"February 9, 2018",5,"It’s gone downhill Lyft has gotten horrible, not only do I have to keep waiting a half hour for a ride but there never seems to be any drivers for lyft in the mornings.

3374,Sharonallisson,"April 24, 2018",1,"Why am I waiting over 12 minutes Why am I waiting over 12 minutes for a ride when there are 6+ cars literally on the same block as me or around. The pooling car ride pairing makes no sense! It always pairs drivers who are super far away. This annoys the drivers to, they basically have to go all the way back to where they originally picked up the first person. Also, lyft drivers tend to cancel trips if its crossing state borders (even though the other state is literally 15 minutes away)"

3377,ThisIsAScam14636,"February 27, 2020",3,"Lyft App This is a great app for when you need fairly priced rides! The real con to Lyft is you can’t cancel your ride, even if it’s right after you ordered it. Multiple times I’ve ordered rides but it didn’t choose the Lyft driver closest, so I was late to my destination. I wish Lyft would let you cancel if the driver is 18 mins away, so you could go to Uber and see if you can get to your destination on time!"

When corresponding with Lyft I was told there was basically nothing they could do about it - including addressing the $63 difference in fare for my ride to the airport. Surprised to say I’ve had much better customer service from Uber."

The nice thing and different than Uber, is that you’re assigned a specific driver from the moment of reservation; making the whole experience much more pleasant. Lyfts rates are much more affordable than Uber, allowing one to give a better tip!"
3383,kendra kenny ken,"December 29, 2019",2,"Drivers don’t get paid enough The payment for drivers is unfair. It used to be 80% goes to the driver, including surge pricing. Now- the driver gets a standard amount per mile and when a customer has to pay surge pricing, Lyft gets the remainder. Not fair. Wear and tear on their car plus gas plus missing important family holidays and working lots of night and weekends- they need to be paid right. I love the ease of use of the app and the service in general is so helpful."

3386,mixed_texan,"December 13, 2019",1,Flaky drivers in Houston I rated the driver high bc I’m not sure if it was the driver but the last 3 rides I’ve had to wait  more than double the reported time for the ride to arrive. The drivers will sit in one place idk if it’s they don’t want to do the drive or what but I’ve wanted to cancel. But i don’t think the rider should be penalized for a flaky driver it’s ridiculous and if it continues to happen I won’t be using Lyft. The driver told me today it’s bc the gps or the app froze or something but I also noticed he ignored 4 of my calls.
3387,vgchokxgxufzifzf,"November 12, 2019",2,"Bait and Switch Whenever I truly need to rely on a car service Lyft pulls a bait and switch. Multiple cars showing in the app less than 5 minutes away. Once I accept a ride it goes to a driver finishing another ride and 12+ minutes out. Then after 8-10 minutes the car cancels and replaces my ride with another driver 8-10 minutes out. I plan to go back to New Family Car Service, a traditional dial up service."

This resulted in me being late and missing my flight even when I scheduled ahead of time . If I were you I would pay the extra money and use UBER . Lyft was a cheap copycat of Uber and will not receive my business anymore."

What an amazing ride!
3396,velezjo92,"July 17, 2019",1,Worst company ever! Lyft has by far the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life! If you have any issues I hope you have at least a week to waste waiting for a response from lyft as they don’t have any numbers to call. I have been waiting officially a week now for someone to respond to a very urgent matter! There is no open line of communication between Lyft and its customers/employees. I will be advising any friends or family to stay away at all costs and use Uber instead.

3398,Febodubo,"July 3, 2019",1,"Can’t get my address right I don’t know why but lyft for some reason can’t figure out how to pick me up or drop me off at my address. My address is clearly in the app as being on street x, but the app sends the driver past street x and indicates they should drop me on the next street which is the back of my building. Uber has no problem so I use uber to avoid the hassle of having to remember to explain it to each driver so they don’t go to the wrong place - which isn’t their fault. Please do better."

I will see a 3-4 minute “driver”, purchase the ride, and then be pinged for a driver 8-10 minutes away.  Typically, the driver is heading in the opposite direction so the actual pick up time is more like 10-15 minutes. Lyft really needs to rectify this or I will be switching to Uber on a permanent basis."

Was assigned another rider 15 min away. I don’t understand how long I need to wait to get a cab. Uber never did this to me.

3442,Bradshuu,"July 31, 2018",1,"Hate the latest update I absolutely HATE this latest update. Please put it back the way it was. Before, I used to be able to move around and it would tell me how many Lyft drivers are in various locations throughout the country. Now, it only shows me drivers that are in my specific spot and I can no longer see how many drivers are in other areas. This is very inconvenient. Why would you remove this? Changes just for the sake of making changes is horrible practice."
3443,Ruffles15,"August 1, 2018",5,"Why I like lyft I like this company because, I am a disabled passenger with service dog and there have been times, when I have been denied service. When this happens, I call customer service and talk to a live person as to machine also, they have graciously compensated me financially at sometimes."
3444,lyft passenger mak,"August 3, 2018",2,"Time estimates to pick up are ALways off I have found that almost every time I look to book a car, it takes at least 5 minutes longer than the “estimate,” at times up to 15 minutes longer. Then today I put the airport in the destination spot and it took me 10 minutes completely out of the way. The app has some issues. Lyft drivers are always kind and very professional though."
3445,Tail chaser ( red fish tails ),"August 5, 2018",5,One of the best. If your in the Mckinney area and lucky enough to get Aaron or Cheyanne as drivers you will not be disappointed. I know it’s kinda tough to drive all the way to Princeton Texas but these 2 people made it worth the wait ( it wasn’t really that long of a wait ). Friendly and easygoing and a joy to ride with.
3446,The Great Baker,"August 5, 2018",1,Three requests I had to put in 3 request in order to get a ride. The first driver canceled my ride and drove off as I grabbed my luggage to head to the car. The second driver sat about 5 houses away and pushed the arrival button I didn’t see him until he drove forward to cancel the ride. I called him before he canceled and he didn’t answer. I was standing outside when he pulled up to the front of the house pushed cancel then drove off as I was calling to him. I almost missed my flight. This was a very bad experience.
3447,Mafe Zelko,"August 11, 2018",2,"I cannot use the app I just got a new phone number and I was trying to edit my profile and set the new phone number, but now the app asks me for my driver’s license (which I don’t have and don’t think I need it just to get a ride) to get an account, when all I want to do is get a freaking lyft ride. I believe the old phone number’s owner used to be a lyft driver but I don’t know how to solve this problem. I used lyft a lot and now I’m gonna have to download Uber meanwhile. HELP"

3450,Gameboy999999,"November 28, 2017",4,Not a fan of the new update I’m visually impaired and this new version is more difficult to see.  It eliminated some features like text describing the color of the car and being able to get a larger image of the driver.  Also can’t seem to add multiple destinations any more...  no more stops at Starbucks on the way to work.😟
3451,so happy i tried it,"June 16, 2018",5,"Satisfied! I’ve been using uber for 6 months twice daily to the same location.  After trying Lyft, I noticed supreme service and much easier location findings!  I don’t use uber anymore. I haven’t been disappointed since.  I’m so glad I started using it!  No uber"
3452,jmbruff,"July 1, 2018",4,"Better than Uber except for ONE FEATURE Lyft needs to create an online and App available process to download any/all history of rides for Corporate reimbursements. Uber has an online way to do this - very nice. If Lyft does already it is NOT well known and NOT easy to find. Make it simple, put it online and via an App and allow to download, print or email."
3453,RoyaltBanks,"July 3, 2018",5,No Response From Customer Service Pretty good on rides except for the hike in prices from different destinations and the no return response on questions or problems with pricing and rides. I received a email for %50 off rides for my 5star rating and they didn’t even award it. Bad communication compared to Uber.
3454,4Geist,"July 4, 2018",1,"Scam I’ve had this happen several times, the driver wouldn’t show up, the ride would be cancelled because “I didn’t show up” and they would charge me 10 dollars. I would dispute it and they would give me EXPIRING credit. Why should I potentially lose money in that situation? I would request my money to be put back on my bank account, and they wouldn’t respond. They basically force you to use their app, or you lose your money. You use their app, and you still lose money without service."
3455,Madison River,"February 14, 2020",5,Walk and save I selected “walk and save” and was instructed to walk 1.5 blocks to the pick up point.  The driver picked me up and then drove on a route that was less than 1/2 block from my home where I ordered service.  Why doesn’t the app minimize the walking distance?
3456,McInTycoon,"February 6, 2020",1,"Real Time Pricing Would’ve been nice to save $15 on a $45 dollar ride. Waited five minutes and the price dropped to $30, and I couldn’t cancel my current ride to get the cheaper rate. There should be a time limit that starts after the expected arrival time to show how late the driver was. I shouldn’t be charged the original fare fee after waiting on the driver. I should be able to cancel at no additional charge. This was very disappointing, and Uber way just be the way to go moving forward."
3457,Dūp,"January 16, 2020",4,"The App is Cool. Great app, however it seems to slow down and not be as functional when you need to do things like stop you scooter ride from continuing. I have been off my scooter and trying to get the app to respond for over a minute. Considering you are charged by the minute, this can be pretty expensive."
3458,Taysujuluv,"January 8, 2020",5,"Error needs fixed Been noticing the last week or so the app has been showing the pick up spot on the map at the wrong spot on the rider app. The driver goes to the right spot, the spot just doesn’t show up in the right place on the map on my rider app."
3459,Askin777,"January 3, 2020",1,"Quit using Lyft after several years I have been using Lyft and Uber both and was primarily using Lyft and spend few thousand a year on rides from Lyft. Unfortunately, I took a ride in Miami recently and was charged double 55 $ instead of 29 $ . Being a frequent Lyft user I brought this to the attention of customer service and nothing was done. As a result I deleted my account today. I ll use Uber or local cab companies from now on. Very disappointed with the overcharge and nonchalant attitude of customer service ."

3462,John From Warren,"November 15, 2019",5,"Clean, courteous and professional I have used both major app ride-share over the past year. The LYFT system seems to attract better drivers. All of my experiences have been positive with newer cars and drivers set to please their customers. "
3463,OGParker1$1,"November 12, 2019",1,Horrible GPS tracking Lyft always fives you the option to select between wayz and  google aps but google maps has always been hirrible with its satellite tracking as compared to wayz wayz will always default show you the quickest ruote google is opposite itll default the longest route and expect you to change route options you know the routes personally Wayz should be the default gps using app and google needs to be fully deleted or a major upgrade cuz google maps is horrible
3464,Brdygrrl,"November 4, 2019",4,"Good, with the occasional snag I take 2 rides a week when I travel for work, same route. Mostly great drivers who are prompt. Snags: Sometimes it locates me on the next street over and the driver gets confused. But my bigger complaint is that there isn’t a way to cancel a driver and start over, like when the car smells of smoke etc."
3465,Matte in SFV,"November 3, 2019",5,"Lyft is the best My experience fits with what I have heard from others and in news, Lyft is consistently better than the other big ride share. Better quality vehicles (drivers tell me that Lyft has a more thorough inspection process). In my area and where I travel, Lyft picks up very promptly. Go, Lyft."
3466,PortlandB,"October 31, 2019",5,"So convenient and they treat their drivers right Love Lyft! I’ve had great drivers, very clean cars (much cleaner than my own)! Easy to install the app and after that it’s incredibly easy to use. Highly recommend"
3467,ariiannnnnna,"October 29, 2019",5,"Lyft Review I really like this app, sometimes it could be easier than Uber just that when it comes to texting for the location to help with directions it’s kinda hard, Uber is much easier. Other than that it works perfect for me."
3468,RIA Vicki,"October 27, 2019",5,"Snow in Denver I first tried UBER and there were no drivers at 8am Sunday. Finally one came up, finishing trip but 20 minutes away. Checked Lyft and driver was there in 5 minutes. And even with an upgrade to better car I paid HALF the UBER posted rate! Happy to give the driver a big tip. Great service."
3469,f in DC,"October 23, 2019",3,Routing is not economical The mapping system for ride share does not make any sense! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been picked up and driven 10-12 blocks only to be routed back to my apartment to pick up another rider then dropped off 20 minutes later than my quoted time. Every time I get in Lyft share I regret not taking the metro because I’d get home faster and not spend any $$
3470,lovenoelle,"October 17, 2019",4,Direction needs improvement I take left to work and everyday I have to tell the driver to turn in the front. Because the gps takes them all the way in the back. And drivers should read the notes that would cut down on them having to call the rider
3471,711Albert,"October 16, 2019",5,Outstanding service. I was beginning to feel ill working with my insurance company and the car rental company taking forever to work things out. I ordered a LYFT and it was easy and quick. I got in the car and left my frustration behind me. I’m feeling better.
3472,Latin Coyote,"October 15, 2019",4,Lousy GPS My address shows me further away than my actual location. I have to adjust the pinpoint to make sure I’m picked up from my actual home address. And going home I have to instruct the driver the actual location of my home address. It’s very annoying. Lyft needs to use a better GPS system.
3473,Brittaney Huth,"October 6, 2019",4,Scheduling rides The app wouldn’t allow me to schedule a ride early enough to get me to the airport in a timely manner. Thankfully the met a driver the day before who offered pick me up earlier than the schedule allowed for. That is what I call customer service. Please adjust your schedule settings to allow for more accommodating times.

3475,jdkfngifjsbxbbfjf,"September 29, 2019",4,Great service. One complaint I love Lyft. My one complaint is that once I accidentally submitted my post-ride page before entering a driver rating and wanted to give her a good rating. There was no way to go back and provide positive feedback after the fact. The only option the site gave me was to give pre-written negative comments.
3476,Krap Nek,"September 28, 2019",1,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE: Phone left in car My wife left her phone in the Lyft last night. Their customer service was absolutely horrible. They keep telling her to check her app, but she can’t because the app is on the phone inside the Lyft. They wouldn’t call the driver to get us in touch with him. The driver was not picking up the phone as I was calling it. It’s been a really bad experience and very stressful. I’m sure this happens all the time, and I am completely surprised that Lyft do not have a workable solution for this scenario."
3477,freebs5980,"September 28, 2019",5,"Loving using Lyft! Although it’s been super unconventional having only one car now.

Just one example- I requested a ride and it told me they would be at the walkable location in 5 minutes, but that location was 11 minutes away from my home. I ran over because I could not afford to be late and the driver waited nicely for me. However the system just does not make any sense! How do I “walk” a 11 minute distance in 5 minutes??"

3486,Cacomyxl,"August 8, 2019",4,"Beyond Transportation My appreciation for Lyft is waning as it loses sight of its original mission to bring drivers together, create community around transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road. The company should be leading the way to elevate the status and wages of drivers and promote better environmental practices such as encouraging use of public transportation. Still better than Uber."
3487,Artfulalf,"August 2, 2019",4,The app has glitches I had to enter information twice..Several times....That doesn’t make sense. I hope I have not been changed twice also. Otherwise my Lyft experience was good. It would be nice to have a feature where I could let the driver know I have a walker or other special circumstances.
3488,Left at the door!,"July 14, 2019",5,"Reliable Lyff is so much more reliable than Uber. You show up quicker, don’t leave the customer guessing if you will really come.

3489,Pepsi Dew,"June 23, 2019",5,First ride Four of us ladies were stranded at the NH train station 10:40pm and needed to get back to Old Saybrook.

I look forward to this same experience with my next Lyft ride.
3490,Boroboym,"March 21, 2019",1,"Temmy  Fort Worth, Texas Normally I wouldn’t do this but, I am a very dissatisfied customer right now. I’ve NEVER had an issue with Lyft until recently. I decided to use Lyft when we went up to Dallas for 2 days and since we were not familiar with the area. For no reasonable reason, Temmy decided to deny service to us. We had his car door open and he said “oh no! I can’t take you guys” and decided to drive off with the car door open almost running us over! Fort Worth area beware of this man! He’s rude and doesn’t deserve a penny!"
3491,Tommy__________,"April 2, 2019",2,"Bait and switch Take screenshots of any promos they offer in the app before you take them. Made the mistake of accepting a promo popup that offered Lux at a discounted rate and found out later the charge was the full amount for a 30 minute long trip. Support was unhelpful. The first few times I’ve been offered a discounted Lux it actually did go through, so if you continue using this app always make sure you screenshot any of their offers."
3492,Alex from Piracicaba,"April 6, 2019",5,"Not happy lately with the app I always use Lyft, but lately I’ve have 2 unsafe drivers, 1 driving clearly under influence. Not to tell that price shown does not reflect amount charges. My last 2 rides price went up 3x due cirlces that lyft drives do. "
3493,nashirm718,"April 9, 2019",5,Latest updates awful My advice is have Uber as a backup. Since the last couple of updates the app freezes and you cannot see if the driver is on the way. Also GPS is messed up and customer care is a robot emailer.
3494,Billzftw,"April 26, 2019",1,The app is not working The app has stopped working for some reason. Even with the new update is still doesn't work. When you try to request the loading bar spins and stops and thats it. You can repeat this over and over it wont work. I wonder if its just me but my friends tried it too and its the same. And i i find it terrible that you cant even talk to representative of the company or even freaking customer service about it. Also i had a refund that i never got.
3495,Nirayah,"May 7, 2019",3,"Bad and disrespectful driver Most of the drivers are rude. They would argue with me,they would go to another address instead of mine then cancel my ride then Lyft charge me $5 cancellation fee or they would argue with me in front of my 9 year old child then ask me to get out of their car in the middle of the ride or they would call the police. That happened several times in a week."
3496,jeffvera8,"May 8, 2019",1,"Trash ""Refund"" Policy I ordered a Lyft by accident because I thought you could schedule a ride like you could on uber. But instead it automatically charged my account and since the Lyft driver was already nearby (I called him, he said he just dropped off a kid) I had to cancel it real quick which was $5 since he was ""less then 2 minutes away"". So it was $15 total for a ride I didn't even receive, and now I don't have a ride home from school. Plus I didn't even receive my money back. Cool, thanks Lyft."
3497,IHaveAClub,"May 23, 2019",5,Hassle Free I scheduled a ride for a friend since I was out of town and unavailable. The ride was on time. Inexpensive and hassle free. The driver called me with his ETA and to confirm details. My friend made her appointment on time and was very pleased. I've never used Lyft or any other ride service before. But I will use Lyft again and again.
3498,FranktheEngineer,"June 8, 2019",3,"Hard to use For a first time user, the app is not intuitive. Trial and error eventually got my ride booked, but it was frustrating as I was in a hurry to get to my destination. I suppose after a few times it will become easier to use, but why force me through that pain? My wife is less than impressed and says next time we’ll just take a cab."
3499,Yeonce,"June 19, 2019",2,"Poor Customer Service Hate lyft. You can budget to ride share with them as the price fluctuates whenever a ride to my job can run me $19 than the next day it’s $40 same distance, same amount of vehicles, etc... It’s also never picks you up in the right location it will have the driver pull down an alley and think I’m coming through the alley to get in the vehicle. They also have no customer service to call as well."

3501,just send my review,"December 31, 2018",5,"Still the best ride app Lyft support is always so quick and they understand the customers frustrations. There are never ridiculous surcharges, or hidden fees. The estimate total is always around about the price I pay. Don’t know how this app isn’t #1 in travel apps, it really should be."
3502,SCDMJJMML,"January 8, 2019",5,"Fabulous app The app is wonderful! The app kept me informed about the progress of our driver to the pickup spot.

I wanted to write and the address of pick up and instead I had to navigate a map to find my home and that was challenging and then I selected a pick up time and instead of complying to the pick up time they sent a driver right away and then of course that driver can’t be canceled even if we’re not quite ready

After he drove off, he reported my account and accused me of being a minor, so they shut off my lyft account. Now I have no ride to work, and am most likely going to lose my job. I can for sure say I’ll be using Uber from now on"
3510,ArryetLove,"October 18, 2018",5,Stop Upgrading Please stop upgrading the app. Leave it be. It just gets more and more confusing. Formats are unimportant. Only getting from point A to point B.

3517,Sandlady73,"November 15, 2018",4,Still a happy customer. Sometimes a driver will accept me then drive away from me instead of picking me up. So give yourself extra time when using Lyft. They do not charge you to cancel when this happens and you eventually get someone to come get you. That is the only problem I’ve ever had. I use Lyft often.
3518,Satified Customer From Milford,"December 21, 2018",5,Thumbs up For Lyft I needed transportation to and from work while my car was broke down and being fixed. The drivers always got to me very quickly and were very friendly. They provided a safe and comfortable ride and kept their vehicles clean.
3519,diogeneshamilton,"December 24, 2018",4,"Wish I could go higher Estimated arrival is integral to this app. Many, many times, the estimate changes multiple times or is just wrong from the beginning.

My fiancé grew frustrated and installed the app, requested a van, and someone accepted almost immediately. We were standing at the same place for pick up, headed to the same place, and neither of us have any reviews since we both just installed it for the Minnie Van service. I have already uninstalled the Lyft app—terrible service."
3523,karen_356,"September 19, 2018",5,"Great app....but Great app and user friendly, however it would be nice to see more options. Maybe a button to select how many passengers in your party or an option to select male or female driver (if available). Just a few more options would be wonderful Lyft!"
3524,zdrastvuytye,"September 22, 2018",4,Infuriating I would definitely recommend it unless your driver cancels on you after you scheduled it a day in advance. It’s annoying and completely unprofessional. The only reason I’m still using this app it because I’ve no other choice. This has happened almost 9 times in two months.
3525,Ersh2578,"September 27, 2018",3,"Why are your rider pickup points so wrong? No seriously.  Unless I'm at the airport, of late not ONE driver has arrived at the actual address I type in as a departure.  Since I see them using the same navigation app I normally use, I can't fathom what nonsensical coordinates you are sending them.  One driver in Boston refused to pick me up because ""I wasn't where I said"".  Please fix this.  It didn't use to be like this."
3526,SeedyEye,"October 1, 2018",5,"No car in LA? Yes, way! I was born and raised in Los Angeles and always hated the traffic. I moved away in my 20s and swore I would never return until I could afford a private driver to take me everywhere. In an ironic turn events, instead of becoming vastly wealthy and famous as I had hoped, Lyft was invented… Which I guess is the next best thing."
3527,Fran CIA,"October 2, 2018",5,"First time rider here I was skeptical about using Lyft. However i found the setting up my account with them for the first time very easy. The payment approval process was fast unlike Uber. I’m so glad that I turned to Lyft,  not only Lyft fare is reasonable the chosen route was simple, easy, and fast. The driver was super awesome."
3528,Erica in NY,"October 17, 2018",5,Love Lift But... I wish it was easier to send a car for someone else. They assume the place you are is the pickup location. I love Lyft. I love the discounts they send me too.   Lately I tried to send a car to the railroad in Merrick and the closest was for me to move the dot on the map.   Those are just suggestions. I love Lyft.
3529,Bartleboy2,"October 18, 2018",5,"App works flawlessly every time Make sure cellular data is enabled on your phone and double-check pickup address, since the app may misunderstand just where you are.  After checking those things, relax and enjoy the ride. This service is great!"
3530,Boocharlie,"July 4, 2018",5,Good during off hours Great concept but during prime hours could be more expensive then cabs so always check first also sometimes lyft is cheaper than uber and other times the opposite so it’s not a no brained but if the customer does their homework it’s a value
3531,mayheleno,"July 13, 2018",5,Not tech sauvy I am not good with technology; however on a recent trip taxi cost from airport to hotel was outrageous.. my son had sent me a link to the lyft app. So I located it on my phone VERY easily connected to it and easily ordered a lyft.  I have used it now for awhile and am very pleased with the ease in which I can use!!
3532,Kenneth Roberts,"July 13, 2018",1,"Lyft Line Car Stuffing Why does Lyft over-pack compact cars with passengers? It’s positively deflating to wait 15 minutes for your Lyft to arrive, only to see that every seat in the car is already occupied. With two large adults already in the back seat, your only options are to pay a cancellation fee and then call another car, or sit on a stranger’s lap. This practice of putting 5 people in a compact car is making me hate Lyft! To add insult to injury, Lyft provides to channel for customers to leave comments and suggestions. ONE STAR."
3533,Lovebyrd220,"July 22, 2018",5,First timers This was our first time using Lyft! We absolutely loved it. Our driver picked us up within five minutes of our request and dropped us off exactly where we need it to be! This saved us a lot of parking money. I think we will spend it on something yummy.
3534,MaeCircle,"July 27, 2018",5,"Satisfied for four years I started using Lyft when I graduated college in 2014. They offered a promotion of 25 free rides in Chicago, and I was drawn to the novelty. Lyft has become a staple of my lived experience since, having moved to three different cities and relying on it for transportation. Always safe and reliable - MUCH preferred over Uber."
3535,Jaylen Holt,"July 27, 2018",5,"Consistent I would’ve have given you a “5” star rating however, I was approach by the first driver boyfriend instead of the Lyft driver Jasmine which made me question my decision on waiting on the next driver Brad.

3536,aam50,"August 15, 2018",2,"Too many issues with their drivers Have had drivers not move one bit and made me wait and then finally they have cancelled and the app has connected me to a different driver.  The app gives an estimated time and should track progress vs that estimate and if the driver is not moving, it should take the ride away from the driver and give it to a different driver (or allow us to re request without hitting us for cancellation fees.)"
3537,Niknmanejeez,"August 22, 2018",5,"Pre-mature car call When changing app features, avoid introducing functions that cause problems. Today, on first time use after update, apparently the driver is immediately called when selecting origin, when I was not ready to call the driver yet."

Many 5 star ratings have been squandered."

3542,KayNoMMLM,"April 16, 2018",1,Faithful lyft rider will never use again I use lyft pretty much everyday normal rides are terrific but my husband decided to use lyft to move our new tv and the driver shattered my 55” tv and now lyft nor the driver wants to compensate for the damage done to my not even two week old television this is ridiculous I will never use this company again I can’t believe this company would do this but just be mindful other riders when using this place they aren’t very trustworthy when it comes to them screwing up ones belongings.
3543,GremBug,"April 24, 2018",2,"Stop raising your minimum fee! I generally like taking Lyft over other ride shares, but over the course of 6 months, you have raised your minimum ride fee multiple times - never bothering to notify the customer.  Unfortunately you’re in a space where customers price shop, so I assume the results of this inflation practice will reveal in time.  But try better to do right by your customer, Lyft - at the very least, a little transparency goes a long way."
3544,lives for chocolate,"May 12, 2018",5,"Where’s my car? I like the fact that you see your driver as they are approaching you.

I was really unhappy and displeased and I really heard great things about lyft but for it to be my first experience it wasn’t a good one...smh
3547,Yaw die,"July 2, 2018",5,Early ride We had an early flight and needed to be picked up at 4:15a.m. I was nervous that our driver wouldn’t show up and this was our first time to use a car service. Wallace showed up early and we were at our airport just before lines were long. Thank you!
3548,AloeCap88,"July 3, 2018",3,Notification Settings Can you please add a feature where we can turn off notifications for discounts and other push notifications that don’t have to do with a ride that you ordered? I know you want to increase usage but at least let us opt out of these special rate notifications without having to opt out of ALL notifications from the app.
3549,rickfish319,"July 3, 2018",3,"App font colors and scale not optimized to accommodate older, lower visioned folk. I m old r and lower visioned. After 40 folks need a font option and contrast that enables their ability to use devices. Things like purple text on black backgrounds may seem cool, but a complete miss for us older folk. Just a a profile check, would you like large font. My phone is maxed out but app servers do not scale their font like the web."
3550,Lulu in Chicago,"September 26, 2017",3,"What the heck? If a driver too far away accepted my ride, Lyft used to override it to give me a closer driver/faster ride to my destination. NOW, however, I keep getting these drivers over five minutes away accepting my ride and I watch them moseying over on the app - meanwhile, the bus I missed five minutes ago (which is why I opted for a Lyft) has two more buses go by. And I am late to work, which I was trying to avoid. 😡"
3551,jkitsmejenny,"October 3, 2017",2,"Horrible problems for NYC I am constantly waiting twice the time the app originally tells me it will take. Then once I try to cancel, it wants to charge me a $2 fee. Drivers almost never pick me up where it says I am. This may be the drivers' faults but I suspect it is the algorithm of the Lyft program. It is not accurate and constantly makes my drivers take crazy detours if you are riding on a Line. There are *much* better rideshare services available in NYC."
3552,Football fan 091994,"October 12, 2017",3,Discounts for everyday Lyft riders. I use Lyft very often and it’s a good source of transportation but maybe for those who ride it very often maybe we can get like a discount every so often? Or for a certain amount of times we use Lyft our account can have a discount on it? It would really help cause I spend so much money on Lyft and after a while the almost $7 for a ride adds up to a lot.

3559,foodboy767,"January 12, 2020",2,"First Driver Bailed; No Recourse Lyft drivers sometimes cancel their pickup after you’ve been waiting for 15 minutes. Tonight the driver drove right past us—no notice, no explanation, just rolled off to another ride, I guess. Lyft provides no way for a rider to leave a review of a dropped ride, so no accountability. I can see where this is going: ride share started out as a great idea. In a couple years, service and reputations will be so bad no one will use the apps."

3566,Vashti96,"October 3, 2019",3,Terrible GPS I’ve had to cancel so many rides because my drivers keep getting lost coming to my student housing. Lyft likes to take them in the complete opposite direction of where I actually am. I get where I need to go every third driver. Lyft was a lot better when I had first started using it two years ago. It really depends on the city you’re in for your experience

Don’t need to experience those drivers again."

I’m constantly getting ad notifications on my lock screen from the app, telling me about Lyft’s latest promo. Not cool. But if you turn off notifications, you miss your ride. I finally just deleted the app. Too bad because I’d use the service otherwise. But I figure any company that shows such a lack of respect for us doesn’t deserve our business anyway."

Everything was going smoothly until I got to putting in payment info. I got this message (Sorry, we are unable to accept this payment method. Please try a different card.)"

Strange because when I selected where I was going I selected my saved “Home” location which Lyft has used in the past without a problem. I noticed the wrong directions and was able to direct driver to correct location. He confirmed when we arrived at my house that the address we went to was the address in the app. Just not at the location in the app.
3577,jessssbbbbbbbbb,"July 26, 2019",3,navigation needs work There should be an option where you can choose which route you want to take so i dont constantly have to navigate the driver myself.

The second time the driver lied saying I vomited in his car and then charged me $100 for cleaning. I complain to there department and just got no real feed back and no way to contest the charge. If you use this service make sure you take pictures of the car before you get in and after you get out so they don’t cheat you like they did me.

3603,RubyNJeff,"December 1, 2018",5,"Best 1st experience!’ I took a chance and tried Lyft as I am not one of those folks who uses apps often. Turns out the app was easy to set up, schedule ride and pay. The best part was that the driver was prompt so I hardly had any wait time. Mr Hide was an awesome driver! I definitely recommend him."
3604,MikeMSY,"December 8, 2018",5,"Great. When It Works. Consistently good Five-Star experience with Lyft Drivers. Retired airline staff here, so I’m all over. Three stars for app that tends to deliver quirky (but tolerable) gps navigation to drivers. Minus -5 Stars if God-Help-You have to contact customer service. Condescending but articulate jack offs, human or algorithmic. Not sure which, but they/it are crap."
3605,Trucker Panda,"December 11, 2018",1,"Rip off to drivers All they do is provide the work and gps location. The drivers pay out for gas, insurance, stress, extras for more good rates. 2 different drivers I had was paid less than half of what I paid Lyft, and that’s just not right especially when there was 8 drivers around the area. So much competition that means fewer rides. I can understand lyft needs to make profit on the tech and items they send drivers but it’s a constant per ride income. They can afford more than half the dang charge."
3606,PawPaw1950,"December 13, 2018",5,"Quick, clean and friendly Requested Lyft from the resort to the airport and he was there in literally less than two minutes.  Much less expensive than a cab or resort driver. Have used Lyft before and will continue. They have never let me down."

3608,vinwepaw,"December 15, 2018",5,"Feedback Only thing that could be better is loosening the weight that the drivers feel to get five stars. Sometimes the old salty cab driver that kind of disappears and does the point a to point b thing is better. But in reality, 4.5 stars is probably more accurate"

They had taken a whole $100+ from my account and $60 more is still pending. I had to have my bank issue me a refund and cancel my card. This company will be sued because this doesn’t make sense. I haven’t heard back from customer service at all."
3626,mbisoux,"August 17, 2018",5,My first time I was in the hospital and was being released and needed a ride. I decided to try Lyft. It only took a few moments to download the app. The driver showed up in about 3 minutes and knew where I was going and already had the directions. Very pleasant and efficient.
3627,sugabear18,"August 18, 2018",1,Sad day My name is Jessica and today was my first day and time using Lyft. My ride was paid for both ways and the driver dropped me off and left 😵. I didn’t know what to do as well as this is my first time being in Atlanta Ga. He told me he was going to wait I have a sick child that I had to bring up here to the children’s hospital and I need him to take me back that’s what I paid for so Lyft took my money and I never got picked back up by the driver. So I had to pay for another Lyft 😡. So for now I don’t think I want to try Lyft again!
3628,peachesNJ,"August 30, 2018",5,I prefer Lyft over Uber Tends to be cheaper than Uber. Sometimes I can get a driver faster too. I also like when some drivers have the Lyft light in their car.

This has happened several times now and it’s very inconvenient. I switched from Uber to Lyft for the “better” service but now I’m not sure this is the case right now. Please fix this issue soon.
3631,IH8LyftBitch,"February 22, 2018",1,"This app is trash All these people giving the app 5 stars are either bots or just trying to get a free ride or something.

We typed our destination and it was 20 dollars just for us to go 5 miles smh, then we close the app and reopen it and it’s 10 dollars.. so which one is it lyft? I’m tired of your crappy service. USE UBER GUYS, IT’S BETTER"

I suspect there were many folks going to the airport (a more lucrative ride) which is why I was pulling the short straw. Are drivers penalized for abandoning for more lucrative trips? Living near west oakland has its advantages but safety and waiting 30 min outside is not one of them.

Granted the trip was cheaper than Uber to the airport but this was my first trip with Lyft...bad first impression . I had an Uber earlier in the day with a great driver in a car that looked like he cleaned it before he picked me up! Vanessa’s car looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed since she bought it! Has anyone else noticed that Lyft doesn’t ask about that? Uber does.

What’s so amazing is he drove back to me an hour after he dropped me off without me even knowing they were missing to return them to me.   This is what community is all about and why I love Lyft ride share.
3691,touchbenmeg,"January 19, 2019",3,"So far so good except.. The delay in gps and lack of overall view for drivers to see drop off location seems off.

IF LYFT KNOWS THERES NO DRIVERS AROUND OR THE CLOSEST ONE IS SUPER FAR WHY CHARGE ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. I used to like it when I finished the ride I gave the driver a review and boom it charged me and done. But noooo, now right after you request a Lyft with no one available they charge you. And Here’s the thing they might give it back to you after a couple of days. And that’s a MIGHT if you email them or not."

Called her and she just got request.  We were late to check in for our plane and half our luggage didn’t make the plane.  No where on your app is there a place for help in situations like this."

I was in process of getting into the car and the driver became irate and just drove off, as I still had the handle in my hand. My arm was jerked and pulled and I sustained a sprain. I will be reporting this to the authorities as well as the BBB. I’m completely outraged by Lyft and their service. Mind you this all happened after my first two drivers charged me a ride that I never received because they couldn’t locate me."

I tried contacting lyft several times to let them know that their driver is a creep and they should not let him drive for them, but no one ever got back to me. My cousin reported the incident to Lyft, and again, no one got back to her. The 1 star is for customer service, I would give them a 0 if I could. Absolutely terrible."

It preserves my dignity.

Personally I don’t think it is a smart idea to have someone walk to their pick up/drop off spot if that’s not where they asked to be picked up or dropped off. Anything can happen especially at night. That should not be included in the share ride. Or just cancel that option all together.

The price was reasonable and Susan drove safely getting me to my destination on time. The app was easy to use and effective. I received text messages confirming scheduled pick up and time of arrival. Good experience using lyft.
3769,daved25,"August 16, 2019",5,Confusing App This does not give the user enough information after you book the ride. I scheduled a ride a day prior and did not get notice if it was confirmed. Even the morning of the ride I had no idea that the ride was coming. Need to improve

Nancy, my driver, was so kind and patient because the GPS took us to the wrong part of the airport and she got me to the terminal, where I needed to be. Probably my fault for entering the destination choice.  But, Nancy was polite and kind and perfectly cordial and wished me a safe trip. I would ride with her any day!"

Today, I booked a ride for myself and my Beau. He wanted to park and ride...too much hassle and much more expensive. Vacation should be stress free. Lyft is just that...ease of booking, prompt arrival, and never felt unsafe."

They have been saying they were 2 minutes away for 15 minutes. The app told them to drop me off in my back yard or the ally. I HATE this app. I’ve been stranded because of this app. I have been put in danger waiting for a Lyft driver and I had to walk a block away to get to them when I put in a specific address.

3777,Truest Fasion,"June 30, 2019",5,Lyft was great. Now not so much. Lyft used to be an affordable competitor of Uber now since they introduced shared saver their prices have increased while maintaining the guise of them “saving” money with a cheaper option. When in fact it is only the cheapest option after the price spike.

Had a great ride with Mike today. So grateful this service exists. 💞"

Recently the app froze after I called a ride, it appeared the driver wasn’t getting any closer for 20 minutes and when I canceled the ride the app completely froze while the driver called yelling at me. I kept receiving texts about new drivers being assigned to me but couldn’t get in the app to cancel. Now the ride doesn’t show in my Lyft app but the fee is pending on my card. Just not as dependable as Uber."

One of them almost ran over me when he dropped me off, another said that she couldn’t have two stops according to lyft but the app has the option for two or more stops. Another one was very rude and his car smelled like a dead rat. This company deserves zero stars. Another time I had a driver who picked up the wrong person. I just don’t understand how many mistakes can you make."

I deleted the app, got a refund from Citibank  (hooray for citicards) and have been using Lyft since. Uber hired the new CEO and are trying to rebrand but it appears they just cut their drivers’ pay substantially so I’m sticking w Lyft. They can rebrand that."

My first order had to cancelled on me, but my second driver “accidentally” push the already dropped me off and took the other passengers, which was an hour ride and another hour ride to my destination. Lyft seriously need to fix their acts. FYI, I wanted to put a 0 stars but won’t allow me."
3786,transparency needed,"May 15, 2019",1,Stay with Uber I’m a new rider on Lyft but have used Uber for years. I’ve learned the hard way that Lyft will screw you. A recent ride with a 1 minute pick up 5 very short blocks from the original destination cost over $20 extra. No warning whatsoever was given. None. I could have stayed with the original destination and later ubered  back and forth for far less. On other rides  I had opted for the $20 deal to get $5 off each ride. Lyft boosts the price by $10 to give u $5 off. Total ripoff.

Only thing is, when I set account up, set it up with my PayPal account. For some reason it wouldn’t accept this as a payment. Will have to further investigate to find out why."
3788,Ehazel99N,"May 20, 2019",2,"Inaccurate pick up status and constant cancellations The main reason why I would choose Lyft over Uber is due to how close my ride was. Almost every time I select lyft, I wait 10+ minutes only for the driver to cancel my ride. This means I could have taken an Uber with a wait of 15 minutes and gotten home sooner. They lie about how close a driver is/if a driver will pick you up just to get your business. When in doubt, CHOOSE UBER."

Like “schedule” a pickup time, it’s grayed out in extra seat tab. I reset my credit info and saved new info but the info appeared not unable to be accessed by the app at checkout and without further explanation. To top that, it asked to provide another credit card with the same billing address as the credit cards already on file. Crazy."

It said my ride would be here in 18min, which is long for non rush hour times. I wait about 10 minutes and come back to the app saying the cancelled it...but my bank still has the money missing. This kept happening as I tried to reorder my lyft. This has happened again today, as I’m writing this. It’s a good app, but unreliable!"

My understanding is that multiple drivers have submitted complaints.

I don’t use Lyft that much but whenever I do 50% of the time there’s a problem I will go back to using Uber. Even though it’s only a couple dollars.

3850,Graynbushy,"September 28, 2019",1,Terrible service any more It used to be cheap and upon clicking the button to order the lyft I was notified the price would jump up 15$.  Then right before being picked up and hit with the charge to bring someone out to Denver airport a kid ordered one. Of course with lyfts mapping in ride share we had to go to the east side to pick him up and then he was dropped off first due to location. So not only did he get the cheaper ride more of his time was spared. I will never order a lyft again.
3851,Dolores1019,"September 27, 2019",4,More on time than Uber but safety concerns Lyft could do more to ensure their drivers aren’t under the influence of marijuana in states where it has been legalized as well as to encourage drivers to be impartial in the music or radio they play - highly offensive at times. However the app is always accurate and so I find Lyft more reliable.

Uber outperforms lyft in every obvious way except that lyft is essentially Uber’s underdog lol. I guess thats a reason to like lyft. Or 🤔 I guess keep it around so if another car service with a similar business model to Uber comes along then Uber can use lyft as a bouncer cause lyft was established first but still is an underdog to Uber 🤷🏻‍♂️So if I was lyft perhaps I wouldn’t care too 🤪

You guys should do ride passes for frequent flyers - put it this way - the ONLY reason I even use uber is bc they’re cheaper and offer ride passes for frequent users - other than that - I DESPISE Uber. C’mon Lyft - treat ya girl good and hook her up!

Unfortunately your app makes it impossible to figure out what my options are and how long my commute would take before signing up. The interactive map that’s embedded on a scrolling page after entering starting and ending location is impossible to navigate. Needs some interaction and UX design love.

Well he wasn’t there, and then when I try to contact him, he tells me to cancel and then the app tries to charge me $12. So now it’s stuck on payment screen for a ride I never receive with no way to try and get another drive. I took a cab. Will never again use Lyft. Their loss."

Two things could stand to be improved. 1 it could do a better job suggesting addresses based on previous trips. 2 you should be able to remove payment methods (credit cards) that you no longer want to use our don't want stored on their servers.

I used to use Uber before I used lyft but switched over because Uber no longer accepted prepaid cards. No big deal they offered the same services for the same prices. One year later Lyft prices are ALWAYS over priced. The app says they’re “busy” so I open up the Uber app to compare rates and they’re DOUBLE what Uber is charging. Permanently lost a customer. Will now open an account that Uber will support.

Then last night I called a driver, it said he was in route, and then all of a sudden the ride was over and I was charged $8. I read another review that said the same thing happened to them multiple times, so clearly this is a scam being done by drivers. I hadn’t even gotten in the car!! There’s no way to contact an actual person to get my money back, so now I’m just out $8. This is ridiculous."

4046,Rapid City Mary,"February 7, 2020",5,First Lyft Ride The Lyft app was very easy to use. We chose Lyft because a friend recommended it. She told us Lyft does a background check on their drivers.

They constantly send the drivers to the wrong place for pick up and when I call the drivers catch an attitude with me & ends up driving away because my 5 minutes are up. Even though I didn’t take the ride I am charged a $5 cancellation fee & I am charged for the ride. I would not recommend unless maybe it was an absolute emergency.

4108,aycorrigan,"January 22, 2019",5,App suggestions I booked a ride in advance which was much easier with the Lyft App than others. The only suggestion I would make is that it should show up in the ‘your rides’ section on the app. I was worried it hadn’t booked.

4111,Calypso25,"September 28, 2018",2,App can’t pin where I am then charged me $5 for their error I was in St Louis for work and the GPS could not find my location no matter how many times I tried. Your pin took the driver to the wrong spot and then you have the nerve to charge me $5 for cancelling due to your apps failure to work as it should.  I was late to my meeting and charged $5 for my hassles. That’s some quality customer service to go with a nonfunctional GPS integration.
4112,Cedar18,"October 6, 2018",5,"Short ride I would like thank Lyft for your willingness to allow very short distance rides.  I have a broken foot and can’t walk very far - I had an appt not far from my house - but Lyft pulled thru accommodated my need & got me to my apt, now I hope they get me home!  Ha!  Very nice driver as well!!  Thanks so much!!"

I will avoid using lyft as much as possible, only because the smells are overwhelming for me. Too bad, otherwise I love lyft and would give it 5 stars if you would get rid of the over-sweet stink! I would much rather have simple fresh air."

4116,MSigourney,"November 4, 2018",5,"Country ride, smooth as silk Lyft is fantastic, easy to use. Our driver was prompt, friendly & professional. An hour long ride could be intimidating although it turned out to be a great fall drive through the country to one of the World’s busiest airports... Smooth as silk baby! Thanks Mario."
4117,T.J.15,"November 12, 2018",1,Lyft service I was hit by someone driving for lyft. The insurance company they have is terrible. They alone have made me not want to use Lyft. It has taken almost a month and I still don’t know what is going on. Still have no information. It took 3 weeks to get a rental car from them. And they have treated me like I am bothering them and am inconvenience. If you put your name on something (Lyft) then you should make sure they are treating people the way you would as a company.

4119,skinnymule,"December 1, 2018",5,My lyft experience The drivers know how to use and read the app and GPS. That is a plus in Nevada. They are professional and courteous unlike Uber except for the driver that got lost and canceled my trip tonight. He should be either re-trained or fired. I hope to keep using lyft. Thank you.
4120,Kathitay,"July 2, 2018",5,Review It’s annoying when people won’t text or call to help themselves to a destination. Or return a text or call. Any call I’ve ever had on the receiving or giving end. Is because someone else took responsibility or didn’t.
4121,MH(JHTHUHHYNVFYH,"July 7, 2018",5,Quick installation. Easy to use interface. I had a roadside emergency between cities and installed Lyft to get back on the road. It went pretty quickly and I was able to get back moving within minutes.

My motorcycle has been broken down, and I needed a lyft...no pun intended, so I’ve used Lyft exclusively, and gone with these drivers, the longest distance was 70 miles from East Chandler to Sun City West, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every single driver. They have all been pleasant, courteous, interactive, and mostly fun."
4123,Adamfialadesign,"August 2, 2018",5,Convenient and reliable It's so easy to call a lyft from your phone and it is there within minutes to take you where you need to go. Almost all drivers are nice and fun to talk to. Extremely great app and a great value for each ride.

I wrote a report for Lyft it’s been two days and they didn’t even  reply my report, and the case was serious. So Lyft is no where near a safe company and I am upset that I have to say this and I do my best to only say good things because I know how hard it is to build a safe company and make people comfortable.

4127,rebitzman,"August 17, 2018",4,"Good, but...... The app has an annoying habit of changing from “personal” to “business” without warning and without any indication that it has done so.  This has led to several instances where I have been reprimanded for using my corporate card for personal use."

I selected a.m. in place of p.m. did not know this until I was notified my driver would be there at 12:15 in the morning. I was charged $10 even after canceling and contacting driver.

During the Corona slowdown, my driver told me that her husband was on disability for a hip operation and she was helping out by Lyft driving on her off hours.

The first driver went the opposite way and he wasted time and ended up canceling on me AFTER 15 MINUTES !!! Then the APP WANTS TO GLITCH !!! The next Lyft driver was better but I could never depend on driver’s accuracy because they are NOT punctual !!!! I NEARLY LOST MY JOB THANKSSSSS

Today I requested one at 3:30 to be at work for 4, the first person I got said two minutes away and disappeared and didn’t answer when I called her, so I needed to cancel the ride and request another which was 7 minutes away and took 10 minutes, making me late to work AGAIN."

But I will in the future. You jacked up my fare to double the normal rate. That’s right, a 100% increase!  There needs to be a fairness cap on peak pricing. 30% more?  But you can’t gauge the customer. As a result of an outrageous fare increase, I will make alternate plans. You got me to pay the high fare once, but now I don’t trust your pricing. And if I don’t trust you, then I can’t use you."

4146,Earthbound11,"October 22, 2019",3,Good but could use better safety features Lyft doesn’t have as many safety features as Uber does. The ability to share your ride with a friend/family member and having Ride Check are good features that make me feel a little safer which Uber has but Lyft doesn’t. Would make the app much better and make me feel more comfortable to use it.

4149,VagSoliloquy,"October 13, 2019",1,Drivers constantly cancel Ridiculous. I was waiting for over 40 minutes for a ride after multiple drivers either immediately cancel or drop off their prior passenger and wait there expecting me to cancel the ride. When I don’t they eventually drop it themselves and the cycle continues. This happened repeatedly for a 2 mile destination and a 11 mile one. I dislike the Uber company but I’m uninstalling lyft as this has gotten far too inconvenient.

4214,Footballowns,"August 5, 2018",1,"Algorithm problem 8/10 rides you’ll have a ride accepted by the driver. But then they will cancel or change rides, idk exactly what happens. You will be jumped from driver to driver and pick ups ETA’s be miss quoted with estimates. This ONLY happens with Lyft, not Uber. I like to use Lyft, but they aren’t good enough, quite often and I will end up taking a Uber, this NEEDS to be fixed. Otherwise Lyft will always be looked at as a joke from someone who is serious about this technology. Lyft, stop F****** around with this pathetic system!!!"

Nothing I can’t solve with a little vigilance, but it gets annoying when you’re in a hurry."

I had to get a new phone and lost a ton of pictures of my children. I even told him I’d give him $200 for keeping it to me. My biggest issue was lyft didn’t allow me to leave him a review. They told me it was too late to leave a review. So drivers get away with stealing my phone and no one would ever know.

It would be more of a convenience for me to schedule a ride twice a day rather wait around 20 mins sometimes 30 mins for a driver to accept the ride. It’s frustrating to say the least.

This was broken when we got to the vehicle and it fell off before we even got in the vehicle. Lyft has HORRIBLE customer service and refuses to listen to me via email and app complaints trying to explain the issue. Beware of their practice to scam the customer on an issue that was already a problem before we even entered the vehicle.

If they have difficulty with English they don’t understand directions on how to get to where they are to where to pick us up.

Long wait at airport when first driver couldn’t fit two bags into his vehicle. Then long wait until second car of the same size came when we had asked first driver to call for a larger vehicle. We were able to fit bags into it. All this took about an hour when we were tired from a long trip. Going to try Uber.

4294,Passenger1977,"November 28, 2018",5,First driver canceled...waited almost a half hour First driver canceled even though he called me so I had to wait for the next one.  Took like a half hour to finally get a driver.  I think it had something to do with their view on the app.  Second driver was great!
4295,Forza Motorports,"December 10, 2018",1,Unresponsive I’ve tried to use the app several times. I’ve managed to use it only a couple of times. Most of the times it freezes or is unresponsive. How are you supposed to depend on it if it does that? I am using an iPhone 7 and running the latest iOS as well as the latest app. No reason for it to be doing that. I was actually going to buy the 30 ride special that Lift offers but luckily I found out the app freezes before I bought it.

She didn’t respond to my second phone call and I have no way to provide on-time feedback to Lyft.

WHAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE CARS TO A 4 SEAT ONE? THAT’S SO UNFAIR TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND YOU DID THE SAME THING TO ME TODAY, IM TIRED OF SPENDING $2 ALL THE TIME, AND NOW IT WENT TO THE POINT WHERE I CANT EVEN GET IT BACK, YOU GUYS PUT SO MUCH EMOTIONAL STRESS ON TO ME THAT TAKING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION STARTED TO LOOK SEXY AGAIN.

I entered the correct address and on the confirmation of a driver picking up the ride it was changed. Was not happy about that but luckily a phone number is given so I was able to correct. Be careful or you can miss your ride
4310,sanjonur,"September 4, 2018",2,"GPS location incorrect I put the street address to my home, but because of the close proximity of a train track (just one line), the location pin shows up on the other side of the train tracks.

Now, good luck!  Why would they change such a successful app?  So unfortunate. Update: it’s truly amazing how such an easy to use and useful app has gone to such a difficult & useless app.  Even though Lyft is great - this app has greatly diminished their value."

The codes didn’t work and a ride was ordered without me even having an opportunity to understand what I was doing. I was afraid. I didn’t know how to cancel the ride. This app treated me horribly. No stars should be awarded.
4323,List Talker,"August 5, 2018",5,I Ride with Lyft I choose Lyft because the drivers provide excellent service. Lyft has accessibility policies that ensure equal opportunity for persons with disabilities and their service animals. Lyft informs drivers of their responsibilities under The accessibility policy and takes prompt and appropriate action in response to rider complaints.
4324,Rad Dar,"August 8, 2018",3,I overall like Lyft but The newest version of the app places your destination bubble right over the drivers path so you can’t see where he or she is coming from. I like to be convenient to where my driver is going to be coming from and without being able to see where he or she is turning makes that difficult.

4334,_sheisraven,"February 20, 2018",2,"Shared Rides Tweaks Lyft is a pretty decent app. My one complaint is the logistics behind matching shared rides. I don't mind sharing a ride; my issue is that often times I am paired with someone who is way out of the way. Also it seems that I am first paired with a driver who is 10min away. I'm willing to bet most people, like myself, don't have that type of time in the mornings. If Lyft were to address these issues, the service would be perfect."

4460,Change Agent,"August 11, 2019",5,Fake times Too often an available car says 2 minutes but it takes 15 or 20 minutes.  You should talk with drivers about “jumping ahead on to assignments” and then finishing prior assignment.

4464,aeioandu,"July 3, 2019",5,easy bookkeeping I like the service very much. Drivers are good drivers and interesting to talk to. A feature of the service which I particularly appreciate is the easy ability to generate a list of rides and costs to use for billing expenses.
4465,Zamora's6,"July 3, 2019",2,"Upset 😢 I’ve used LYFT and loved it! Lately though it’s been hit and miss. I’ve had to use UBER, which is always more expensive, but, only because I’m having soooo many issues with my app. Every time I’m trying to schedule a ride it says poor network connection EVERYTIME! When I can get a ride I’d rate them 5 stars but, right now it’s just frustrating. I get so many offers and discounts that I can’t use 😩"

Then my lift was cancelled somehow, history won’t show it until the ride is completed. I got to work 40 minutes late and i was fired. Completely unexceptionable. I have 2 young babies no car and no place to really stay. My job was keeping us afloat. So lyft really brought some hardship on me today."

4474,gbcdhsxnjamk,"May 17, 2019",2,Needs a lot of work Why aren’t we allowed to see how many rides they have given or their rating? Why does the app always make it look like they are five minutes away and then they pull up and yell at you because you’re not outside? Lyft really needs to get it together. I love that they send me discounts and are generally cheaper than uber but they need to work out some kinks in the system.

4488,pedro_blake,"April 8, 2019",2,"I spend a lot of $ with you You do not reward your customers anyway whatsoever. I chose your company over UBER 2 years ago. I’ve probably spent $10,000 on LYFT rides the past 2+years and received maybe 1 discount. Why not taking care of your loyal customers it’s hard out here without a valid Drivers License. Maybe even have rewards programs for the people that keep you in business. Im downloading UBER app again."

They froze an account for no reason so I wasn’t able to use it at all in another city & they responded back after I was gone. Ridiculous. U ber has been cheaper & better anyway. Don’t recommend until they get their crap back together. I used to tell everyone how much better lyft was but idk what happened to them. Money?? Sad.

Lyft drivers are of the highest moral standing and adapt well to differing social environments. Whenever I have felt as though I were in a pinch for a ride after closing time. You can rest assured I opened Lyft.

I don’t understand how it shows closer drivers but gives me the farthest one talking about “it’s the closest one” I feel like you should fix this because this is unexceptional  I always get to my destinations late. Uber would never.
4508,t_adele,"January 24, 2019",2,Can’t edit or cancel credit card on file There should be a way to edit a credit card that’s saved on file. The expiration date changes. Also I shouldn’t HAVE to be required to have one saved on file due to the hacking that happens to business and corporation accounts. I should be able to enter it at the time I order my ride. Otherwise the service is great.
4509,lelyxo,"January 24, 2019",1,"Horrible experience The services are bad. Most drivers are disrespectful and most of the time the car on the app isn’t the same. One time I requested a Lyft to pick me up and the driver end up calling me with an horrible attitude asking me am I 18, of course I know it’s was to be certain but after I repeated said yes and told him I have an ID he then report my profile. Customer service is difficult to reach so I ended up needing to call a friend. I now use Uber which is way better !"

It has pictures of my daughters whole life on it and I would love to have it back. What’s it going to take?"

Lyft gives the driver a 15 minute window of when they’ll show up, and the driver arrived 15 minutes after the arrival window (30 minutes after my scheduled time). Very poor first experience. Why is there no penalty for the driver arriving that late other than a bad review? Why don’t I get some form of compensation? He accepted the ride an hour before the scheduled departure time, and then shows up 30 minutes late?! Come on!"

4585,pdxpete,"August 3, 2019",4,Needs improvement One of the biggest faults I find with the Lyft’s software is that once you have made the arrangements for a car you cannot adjust your current location even if the software is off by two or three blocks. Very stupid.
4586,Pipm87,"July 20, 2019",5,I’ll tell ya. You give yourselves a bonus and your drivers a pay cut that carries over to pay a settlement for a strike. Your drivers work because they have to. Do better as a company. People who you need are hurting because of your company.

4604,ejwebs,"April 19, 2019",3,Beware of extra miles from longer routes Twice the lyft directions took us the long way and charged extra.   Booo really disappointing. So riders beware and bring up your own maps and let the driver know cause it’s the lyft directions that is doing this.  Our last ride we gave the driver directions and shortened our ride.
4605,Nikevaaaaa,"April 21, 2019",1,I do like lyft but... I’m tired of extra money being taken from me during rides and I’m tired of lyft drivers getting away with grimy acts like “forgetting” to drop off their customers. I do admit that lyft does reimburse me when my money has been taken from a “slow” driver or someone who “can’t find their way” even with a GPS. but not all the time. I just think lyft needs to start handing out warnings to these drivers because they’re getting away with too much.

We’re all for drivers having the freedom to choose but to do so after accepting the ride is pretty crappy. Especially when we’re waiting outside with groceries and 4 kids.

I couldn’t believe it. I also don’t like how you can’t see reviews of the driver picking you up. If anything we’re to happen while on the ride there is no way of reporting it therefore I don’t feel safe with lyft. For their prices they should change a few things!

4741,MariaFal,"August 26, 2018",1,"New update is awful I used to swear by lyft, but after the new update rolled out a few weeks ago, I think I’m switching back to uber. There was nothing wrong with the old interface. Now each time I call a ride the app switches the driver several times, sometimes to a driver who is further away, before finally settling on a driver. This is extremely inefficient, wastes my time, and irritating for both me and I’m sure the drivers too. Super disappointed!"
4742,xfdrttxdsdcxrgvft,"September 1, 2018",3,Inaccurate On a regular basis they show more available  cars than are actually available. I routinely book a car only to find out that there are not that many cars available and end up having to wait longer than expected. Cars also cancel on you or just don’t show up.

It is aggravating that my drivers are constantly canceling my rides and charging me cancellation fees when the gps sends a different pickup location than what was inputed. I have also experienced incorrect drop off locations. I take lyft so that I can safely make it home, I don’t appreciate being dropped off several blocks from my intended destination and being forced to make a journey that I intended on avoiding."
4745,mendy from tx,"October 5, 2018",5,We love Bernard Bernard was very friendly and helpful. He gave us ideas on places to visit while in town. He was also very patient while we found the pickup location in an airport that was unfamiliar to us and accommodated our luggage.

When I tried to redeem it through my email didn’t work so I was unable to use the discount and now I’m feeling a Little screwed.

4762,CrookedBean,"December 31, 2017",5,Much better This application is much cleaner and efficient as compared to uber. The UI makes sense to get around. I left uber because of how they manage their application and the news about their drivers. Overall awesome app. Staying with Lyft
4763,Rachel✌️,"February 4, 2018",1,"Was forced out of the car. When I got into the lyft, the driver asked if I was 18 and “allowed” to use lyft. She proceeded to tell me and my sisters that we needed to get out of her car or she would call someone to come get us out. I’m 17 and I have been using lyft for about a year and a half and I was NEVER told that I had to be 18. When you sign up for lyft, there is NOTHING that asks your age, and my parents were completely fine with me using the app to get where I need to be. WORST DRIVERS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!"

4770,Lala4609,"September 27, 2017",5,Lyft drivers cancelled ride often If you have kids under the age of 5 lyft will not give you a ride because you don't have a car seat. THEN MAKE SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE WITH KIDS BECAUSE ITS RIDICULOUS IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE AND THEY EXPECT ME TO BE CARRYING A CARSEAT FOR MY KID IN TOP OF HAVING TO HOLD THE HAND OF MY KID SO IT DOESNT RUN TO THE STREETS. AND NOT JUST THAT EVEN WITHOUT A KID SOME DRIVERS LIKE TO CANCEL THE RIDE BECAUSE UNKNOWN REASONS AFTER THEY ARE NEAR YOU AND YOU ARE WITHOUT A CHILD.
4771,Julyfs,"September 28, 2017",1,"Great app ""Uber is so much more expensive"", ""Lyft has more drivers"", ""the cars are better."" So many times that I heard these. Truth is: Uber care about their passengers. For over an year I have had multiple problems with Lyft, but I barely remember having any in Uber. Besides, I can't even count how many times Lyft matched me with random passengers out of nowhere making my traveling time extend up to an hour and half (with regular traffic). Well, there you go with your ""best app."""
4772,blackboxerbriefs,"October 16, 2017",5,"THIS APP... This service is not much different from Uber, but what keeps me from using this instead is the app! It freezes after requesting for a ride at the driver profile page and what keeps me from coming back."

4777,Slylilgirl,"February 25, 2020",5,Passengers It’s a great app but thinking about it what if we used it to get from A TO B with more than two people and some Lyft people don’t understand that there’s no button for it I just updated so hopefully it’s there now but heads up ⚠️
4778,UrchinVT,"February 7, 2020",4,"Good but no option to request a female driver The first ride share company to allow girls and women to request a female driver will clean up. I’m amazed that Lyft hasn’t. Other than the lack of that option and the fact that I often can’t schedule a ride, I like the app and use the service."
4779,only1uncle,"February 6, 2020",5,Jason Jason was very courteous and polite. It was storming during our route he was a very safe and cautious driver. He was very hospitable towards myself and the other passenger. I rate his services at a 5 if we had more men like him I. The world what a better place the world would be!!!
4780,McNab 3,"January 22, 2020",5,Very Quick Response Time I’ve never had to wait more than about 5 minutes or so for a ride. That’s extremely convenient. Thanks to you and the good drivers (about 10 so far).
4781,Nobooooo,"January 10, 2020",1,Uber is way better than lyft. Lyft treats their drivers bad. Always threatens drivers saying the account will get deactivated. Even if the passengers cancels or calls to cancel. Lyft also pays less than uber to drivers. Uber is and has always been the most preferred platform to most of the drivers. People think lyft drivers are nicer but no theyre only scared of the platform. Cant wait for lyft to follow juno and get out of NYC. They are hardly surviving the competition with uber here. Cant wait to say good bye to lyft.
4782,John's POV,"January 4, 2020",5,Reputable and Reliable I appreciate that Lyft actually pays attention to the reviews left on drivers. They care about the customer experience. The app is user friendly and updates locations quickly.
4783,HopIndy,"January 4, 2020",4,Lyft solid app Pretty seamless ride share app experience with lyft. Almost always has timing and location services right. On occasion the pick up street isn’t spot on requiring sometimes challenging calls with drivers to align on meeting points. But still I use it exclusively now for rides.
4784,SlyVerses,"December 21, 2019",4,Ride share app Good app usually good drivers and experiences just like Uber but a bit better for your budget. Not a 5 star because the shared saver option is just crazy expecting you to go on the side of a highway way to meet for a pickup spot! Then drop you off god knows where if your driver is cool.

I was super confused because the airport is only about 7 miles from my location. I ended up canceling to request another Lyft yet still no one was accepting the request! I was super bummed because I’ve used Lyft over Uber in the past.... but this time Uber won.
4787,Atlg67dh,"November 22, 2019",1,"Poor Payment Practices Lyft does not allow passengers to change payment type after a completed ride. Uber allows payment changes up to 30 days after. Additionally, it took a long time to find a phone number to call and actually speak to a customer service rep. Their customer service personnel are very condescending and unhelpful. Will not be using their services again and will switch to using Uber exclusively."

I canceled my ride and got an Uber instead."
4790,rhnnPhyllis,"November 9, 2019",5,Amazing Experiences The Lyft drivers really enjoy their job and go out of their way so you enjoy the trip. As a tourist they have great suggestions about where to eat. Very kind people willing to share the beauty of their city with others.

4792,Nettie 38,"October 30, 2019",5,Love Lyft Lyft is a answered prayer for many. Taxi rates were ridiculous and some drivers would take you on a scenic ride just to boost the price of the ride.

My drivers are always going on opposite directs from me and the app is always taking them in weird longer directions. I’ve had multiple drivers complain about this. So I’m left waiting double the time it would usually take. When I try to conceal once instead of being 5 mins away turns to 20 mins I get a 5 dollar charge either way. Please fix your app!"

Invariably this means heading West to go East and vice versa. The same us true for destinations, where we often arrive across the street from where we’re going. In a city, especially, it makes a difference."

Still no resolution after 3 business days aside from me never using Lyft again.

Now, every time I’ve taken Lyft, I get to my destination after 20-30 mins! Ridiculous! I could probably take the bus and it would be faster and cheaper mind you I own a car. It’s faster and more convenient for me to drive when it used to be the he opposite. If I want to be late for work I know to take Lyft. However, I WILL deactivate my account. I rather pay a taxi drive or Uber."

Drivers should have to disclose any cars that smell like smoke.  I should have the choice to opt out/in of smoking cars prior to the ride.  It’s too late once the driver arrives.

Tried to get a hold of left by phone to tell mom my problem and there is no way to contact you by phone.

I am finding myself calling each request to navigate them to my location. I understand there may be times in the city the gps may get confused but it has been quite annoying. I started using cabs in between and I never use cabs. Overall I enjoy lyft just a little less convenient this go around. Thanks!!

I set it up to go from my friends location to my house and  the app switched the address from my location to her location. I tried to change the address several times and it wouldn’t let me do it.

Just now got it back after a day of run around on the website & spamming the lost report for my phone. I get the private policy but refusing to give the drivers either number or email for contact is another story. The website wouldn't accept a different number than your account number so it was impossible to do anything. Never again!

4927,bucnoleman,"September 29, 2019",5,First time user for Lyft Great first impression for us. We really enjoyed our driver and had nice conversation with him during our ride. First time user so we have driver a cash tip instead of on card. Will definitely use Lyft again in future.
4928,S Foote,"September 24, 2019",5,Good service I have never had a problem using Lyft. The drivers are friendly and usually pick you up within minutes of placing a request.
4929,Nojyfied,"September 19, 2019",5,Too slow. Why do you want me to update every month. Lyft makes you update a 100MB app every month while you get drenched in rain on a crappy cellphone network. 
4930,Fit4Ever#1,"September 18, 2019",5,First time user Very easy to use app and informative so that you know exactly who your driver is and when they’ll arrive. I liked being able to preschedule my trip and knowing the price.
4931,whumpis,"September 4, 2019",1,"Lyft Drivers Sexual Assault is Egregious I just read the complaint filed against Lyft for not taking adequate action against sexual predators who are drivers and whose actions clearly violate norms and law.  Until they adequately demonstrate changes in drivers screening, publicly respond and update victims who complain, publicly remove drivers who receive complaints AND update safety features in the app to address risks (police button) I am deleting the app and encouraging my family and friends to do the same."

4933,VATSVATSVATS,"August 13, 2019",1,Lisa Clark This is the first I used lyft. I scheduled a time but somehow thru the schedule transaction my timeline was changed?? And  I had to cancel the first car just to schedule another car 5 min later that took 10 min to arrive. 
4934,srmons,"August 12, 2019",5,"Terrible After the person accepted the ride they came to the house, we got in, and then she told us she can’t go to that destination because it is too far. This is ridiculous, fix the app."

I missed work both times due to this and was nearly terminated as a result. Unbelievable to inform a customer of something so important with no time whatsoever to alter planning prior to the time service was needed."
4942,jt8913,"June 30, 2019",1,"Mischarged Fee from lyft I’ve been using lyft for over 6 years. I’ve preferred it over uber. However, I was mischarged for a damage fee I did not cause. I tried multiple avenues of communication to ask them to review the situation but I was not given a transparent response, and I was just told that they deemed the charge correct. They did not check the validity of the photo sent to them about the damage, or ask me for more information to investigate on the presented evidence."
4943,stephanie13042,"June 29, 2019",1,Never using lyft again. I had been charger for my lyft then I was charged again saying I had took another lyft when I had only gotten one ride. The guy who drove me his map didn’t show he had picked me up nor on my map never ridding with lyft again they are just taking money out of my account for no reason & said it took a while to get to my destination when it really didn’t take more than 15 or 20 minutes to get there.

Kinda flawed for someone who only uses one card for everything 😬. Didn’t think that through did ya Lyft? Made a report and everything and still no solution 2 weeks later. Anyways yep uber is better 😂."
4945,Milong123,"June 24, 2019",1,Disappointed Why have the “contact driver” option if I can NEVER get in contact with the driver. I understand sometimes they might be driving but I’m positive you’re able to reply back if you’re at the pickup spot waiting for me. What if I have special instructions or disabled and need an extra minute or two to get downstairs? We should have that option throughout the entire ride not just when we request it.
4946,joy's iphone update,"June 23, 2019",5,"Clean cars, nice guy, safe driver I can’t say enough about being able to get into a clean car and with someone who is responsible. I’ve had my share of riding in cars that I wished I had not gotten into."
4947,john.haggard,"June 21, 2019",1,"Pathetic Seriously? There’s no customer service? There’s nothing you can absolutely do, nothing. You’re at the mercy of whatever happens and whatever bone they from you. Driver never showed up you cannot cancel the ride and start a new ride. No customer service, no help, absolutely nothing.  The people who designed this app and the company behind it couldn’t flush a toilet."
4948,Ell910,"June 14, 2019",1,Lyft Review Driver didn’t communicate well.  He  canceled Lyft without giving us enough time to walk from the terminal to where he was waiting at and then charged us $6.00. While standing in the rain we tried contacting Lyft again to get a different driver and the same thing happened. I will never use this service again and I suggest that anybody else doesn’t use this service also. I used Uber and didn’t have this problem at all.

4952,rrandolph21,"March 21, 2019",5,"First time First time using Lyft. Driver was great and came quickly. However, we had to walk a block in the cold to Stand at some old closed building to wait on the ride. Like why couldn’t we be picked up a block away?"
4953,preconfirm,"March 24, 2019",4,For worrywart types It would be great to be able to confirm that a specific driver has signed up in advance (night before for ex.) for my predawn pickup. I know you work off immediate GPS data but still is there no option for committing to a drive within 8 hours say??
4954,jacygem,"March 25, 2019",5,Fabulous Ride! What a great service!  First time using and I will definitely use again and refer to my friends!  Driver was at my house in less than 10 minutes and was friendly and very helpful with my luggage!
4955,makeda42,"March 30, 2019",3,1st trip My first time using so a bit confusing. I requested a car and received three notifications that a car was there but no car was there!  The option to contact the driver did not work. No answer. Finally the 4th try worked. Thanks to that final driver who was actually at the pickup point.
4956,Scheherazade Lisa,"April 7, 2019",5,"Too many cancellations When two cars cancel every-time I book a ride and it takes an extra 30+ minutes to get a ride, not the best service"
4957,Rainbow Randy,"April 8, 2019",5,Lyft universe Fast and friendly drivers.. always nice.. And I appreciate the ability to update and recover my account even though I change my phone number because Uber wouldn’t let me do that
4958,lyft Tanya,"May 24, 2019",4,"Good not great Good app! However, Lyft needs to update the drivers ETA. The time it gives people is rarely accurate. Also, please hire better drivers and people that speak English. Many times my drivers barely can understand English and they miss turns and drop offs and it’s annoying."
4959,Desired99,"June 5, 2019",5,"Desiree Sometimes I receive great service than other times the rides are horrible!  Most drivers get to me not the time that is scheduled, maybe 10 to 15 mins late when the time tells me otherwise!"

His car was immaculate! He even waited a few extra minutes for me at the airport! Superb customer service !"
4961,PRNCSS98,"February 1, 2019",1,Price of rides If your prices were more consistent especially after I've already been given a price for my ride it would be a better experience. Nobody likes surprise fees and most of the time it's not the riders who makes the ride take longer the drivers never pick me up in front of my house and will take forever to take me where I have to go thus making my ride cost more. It's not fair things need to be done better.
4962,JW911W,"February 1, 2019",1,"Customer Service is Terrible After having an issue with the charges for a ride I took, I reached out to Lyft to remedy the issue. The bot couldn’t resolve my issue so I escalated it. Frances in Lyft Support reached out a couple days later and said “Our engineering team is actively investigating what went wrong and will be reaching out to you very soon.” It has been over a week now since that message, and no matter how I try to contact support, I have gotten no response."

4968,clearric,"March 10, 2019",1,"Use Uber Instead Use Uber Instead! Don't waste your time and money. One particularly bad experience I had with lift was on a day when it was sleeting out, cold and windy. The second lift, like the first, passed us and turned down an adjacent street, not even stopping at our location. We called and no one picked up. So we called again and someone picked up but no one spoke and I still got charged for missing the lift. Then we called with Uber and as usual no issues."
4969,tucker4403!,"March 12, 2019",5,A great service More pleasant than taking a cab. Our only issue is recently we have had many drivers drop us after accepting the ride due to the short distance
4970,Ireni0,"November 21, 2018",5,"Better than Uber Once you become a 5 star customer on Lyft, they will send you discounts, which Uber never does. Also if you compare prices between the 2 companies, Lyft is alway a few dollars cheaper per ride."

4974,Mimi Cindy,"December 12, 2018",5,Great guy! Leroy made my ride to the airport very pleasant. He’s a great driver and very knowledgeable which made our conversation last the entire drive. If the app would let you request a particular driver I would recommend him to everyone! Thank you Leroy!
4975,Gaslite PB,"December 13, 2018",4,Some Improvement Needed I’ve noticed that the GPS locator is not very accurate (sometimes a block or 2 off) and there needs to be a way to give specific directions for “unique” or special pickup locations (drive to the 2nd driveway and then turn into the parking structure).

Lyft was working fine for me until I realized my rides kept showing up at slightly different places than arranged, e.g. across the street, or around the corner from where I was. Then as I was crossing the street, or turning the corner, my ride would take off and Lyft would charge me 5$ cancellation fees. This has happened way too often. Sometimes, rides would just be no show. Where is my cancellation fee for that?! Uber works better. Forget about Lyft. Seriously"

5020,miasoko,"September 26, 2017",1,"HORRIBLE customer service I keep getting charged for rides that I did not take. I do not live in the LA area and all the rides I get charged for are in LA. When I asked customer service to help me, they just completely ignored my points explaining why I could not possibly have taken these rides, and asked why my ride was bad. My ride was not bad; I did not take any of these %#^&@* rides. Now I’m having difficulty closing my account. I will never ever take a Lyft again."

It’s not letting me use my account because I need to have payment bills when I already have it. Im using my dad’s card and he allowed me to. In fact he told me to use it even. Apparently for his card to work, I have to verify it which I already did. It said that I needed to contact support but that’s what I hate the most in here."
5022,enternetboi,"April 25, 2020",1,"Not Dependable AT ALL I use this app to get home from work everyday. Every time I come on here to get a ride- it takes 45-1 hour to find someone to take me home. I don’t know if they’re aren’t enough people around, but if that’s the case...I want my money back. The app will take my money a use it as payment for “the next ride” I don’t want a next ride, you guys couldn’t come get me the first time..put my money back into my account."

I get if the gps is wrong, but you shouldn’t just ignore my calls or the message that tell you what APARTMENT I’m in front of. I hope Kristen (the driver) reads this because this is especially for her. Other drivers are like this most of the times. Sometimes you find a gem who can actually read and find my address."

That is something that has to be changed for real because yall charge the bank immediately rather it finds a driver or not. THATS CRAZY!!! and you mean to tell me that theres no way to get my money back you it doesn’t find a driver! Thats not right at all."
5031,talkthirtytome,"February 25, 2020",1,The worst Lyft has discriminatory rates and fees that do not make sense. After waiting 20 minutes with drivers canceling or getting lost because of faulty routing—to request a new ride doubled my fares. It really falls on the company because the GPS within the app hasn’t been invested in and there is no reliable queue of available drivers. This is not the first time this happened and am certain it won’t be the last for other customers.

This isn't so bad on the way home when I can direct the drivers. I can NEVER use Lyft for a pick up because of this. I even had to cancel a pick up because my driver didn't know where he was and didn't speak english. I still want my $5.00 back.  Please do something about the GPS."

By the time they actually got someone there it was more than a half hour after I was scheduled to be picked up, and I nearly missed my flight.

The amount of times I've ordered a ride, and my ETA said I would be on time, and I ended up being 20 minutes late for work is unacceptable. They send drivers that haven't completed previous rides, so the pickup time is usually 20+ minutes out. They also do not answer the phone when you call, making it very difficult to coordinate pickup. Very disappointed!"

But they end up charging you more for premium prices when you don’t expect them and adding up to 5 stops on a pool. Maybe you get nicer drivers or whatever they promote but it’s a longer drive, worse route, and there’s no space to rate rides. Also drivers are way less professional.

When give them location to pick up they drive around everywhere why they just stop in one place. When try you reach them they already charger you $5 and cancel. It’s not good they know where to drop up or pick up. Deleting this app and Uber is better then Lyft. Lyft driver give very hard time for passengers. I wish I don’t give one star either.
5052,Fada~ngourma,"October 12, 2019",3,"Good The app is good and well payed out. But some important functions like adding a stop, round trip should have well visibles buttons.

5054,Rygar666,"October 2, 2019",2,"Reporting functionality The app clearly needs support to provide feedback on drivers when you’re not the passenger. I’m sure Lyft doesn’t want to police this stuff, but bad drivers are tainting your brand. So the ability to report cars on the road is important to weed out bad drivers. Seriously, it can’t be ignored and will only help your service in the long run. Add functionality in the app."

5110,AllieK416,"October 2, 2018",3,5 stars but... I love Lyft but I wish the customers could choose which Lyft driver to have from who’s available. There are some Lyft drivers that are crazy or rude and I want to be able to give money and have my ride from a driver that I know I like. Please consider updating to this. I know a lot more people would like that feature too.

5113,Macsagar,"October 12, 2018",5,Waiting time as long as 20-30 minutes App is allowing drivers to pick up a ride even before completing their existing ride. This is increasing rider’s waiting time to 30 minutes....ridiculous!!
5114,BS Miami,"October 20, 2018",3,Bait & Switch? Compared prices with Uber and Lyft was less expensive. So I chose Lyft. As soon as I chose Lyft the price went up. From $16 & change to $17 & change. When I arrived at my destination and went to write my driver review I saw the price had gone up again to $21 & change. Probably won’t use Lyft again. Even though I liked my driver and ride.

5135,Winter0218,"August 3, 2018",5,Best Get-A-Ride App EVER! Lyft is the best because it seems to have taken a leaf from the book of its competition and then added more details and user-friendly options just to ensure that their name stands out in the crowd. Try it and you’ll never stray.

I was so upset my 1,000 phone was stolen by the driver and they refused to help or look into it. Horrible customer service and will NEVER ride in a lyft again. UBER ALL DAY."

I don’t mind to pay more if the price increase and the service is better but if it continue like this I would rather take Uber."
5154,ian4256,"February 24, 2020",3,Language barrier and incompetence If you can get past that.... the app is cheaper than Uber. I’ve used it a few days and most drivers I’ve had tried to have ME cancel so I can get the charge. If they don’t try that most them don’t speak English or have any idea where to go even when given directions.
5155,mucha_lucha,"February 19, 2020",4,Good App decent service Like most ride share Lyft is hit or miss. They’re either nice clean cars with great drivers or old dingy cars with horrible drivers. I wish we could block drivers completely sometimes. I would also like a rewards and/or more discounts.
5156,D. Jallow,"February 6, 2020",2,"Slow, Rude Drivers My title is the reason I deleted the app. Some of the drivers were either slow to get to my pick up stop so they could get the five dollar fee (bc they had been “driving” for at least five mins).

There is nowhere to track or indicate if you are currently being charged on the app so you have no way of knowing!  Trying to get a refund :(
5159,DreadheadDes,"January 29, 2020",1,Horrible app This app is horrible when you’re on a time limit. Before you Confirm your ride it will give you a estimated eta but when you confirm the ride the time is always different than what it actually is thus making people late for things they have to do also some drivers will say 6mins and it will take them 20mins to get to the pick up location. Would not recommend for anyone to use

Anyway I hope it was automatic because I can’t figure out how to cancel"

They will be at the wrong destination not even following the gps and won’t answer the phone when you attempt to call or text the driver. They simply wait until they can cancel the ride and cancel it which is extremely inconvenient. Uber has the option where you can text drivers within the app which is very convenient.

5225,skutta3000,"February 15, 2019",5,Should engineer better! What is really sad is that Lyft’s algorithm is so flawless that in a rust request lyft can not compensate for these timelines. Lyft if you read these requested you should optimize and engineer a better way to make understand how to compensate the driver and the customer!
5226,socialworker8,"February 18, 2019",4,Appreciate the service Lyft has been very helpful for me as a social worker transporting women to doctors appointments when I can’t. I only wish we could request previous drivers or a preference of male/female driver. It can be scary for some of my girls (and myself when I use it) to get into a car with a strange man.

Lots of incredible drivers, but this company has got to do something about the fact that there is just about zero chance that you can get help if something goes wrong with the ride. God forbid you have to cancel because your driver has no idea how to operate your local airport and you’ve been waiting for thirty five minutes at 2am. Somehow that’s your fault, and you don’t get a refund."

The Driver tried to initiate sex with the girl he was supposed to be getting somewhere, and then continued to bother her and make her feel unsafe through the entire ride. And in the data from the ride you can see that this idiot stopped the car and also took twice the time the ride was supposed to be. If I was richer I would be slamming Lyft against the wall in court. #garbage"

5260,jasminehansel11,"July 27, 2018",3,Just one problem I love the app for the most part but I had a driver literally drive past me and leave and let my departure time run so I couldn’t order a new lyft and if I cancelled that one I would get charged.

It took me 3 times as long to get home solely due to this, in 8 degree weather. This is an ongoing issue.  Lyft needs to prevent this from happening."

5394,NicWaze,"August 29, 2018",5,Better App Experience I see some added changes to app; which I like .... new or to say better enhanced features ... which probably isn’t a major change but I like navigating on this site ...
5395,Jackson Creations,"August 31, 2018",5,Professional and Friendly Service! All of my rides have been so incredible. This service has helped my life a lot. When ever I have an emergency or just want a night into town I can depend on Lyft to be there. Thanks
5396,SSX333,"September 2, 2018",5,Location setting could be better When I put my address or set location on map it sends the driver to the next complex.  There is a brick wall between us.
5397,windy city 2018,"September 2, 2018",4,Difficult to reach a representative Overall lift is a very good service but there have been times where I’ve been charged and not picked up. I’ve had difficulties trying to reach a representative and be refunded. I’ve never been able to make contact with a rep.
5398,JayJohnnie,"September 2, 2018",1,Absolute BS I am usually a loyal Uber user but today I tried lift. I think it’s crazy that drivers can cancel on you without waiting the full 5 minutes. We literally ran to meet our driver and he wasn’t even at our pickup location. About 5 seconds before we got to his car door he canceled on us and then lied to our face! I will 100% stick to Uber that'll at least honor their policies and hold their drivers to a professional standard!
5399,JDagoF,"September 4, 2018",1,Total waste of time Try using this service and couldn’t get even the app to work.. added a debit card a credit card and a PayPal account and didn’t work and didn’t have me a reason why.
5400,Chintu1208,"April 29, 2018",5,Great New interface I am in love with the new interface that I see for Lyft now...I don’t know why my frnds don’t see it on their app but this is the best UI ever for a app I’ve seen also one of the finest travel app for pick and drop with reasonable prices.
5401,STBlomker,"May 10, 2018",1,"WILL NOT WORK WITH APPLE WATCH I’ve tried everything and this app will not work on my Apple Watch. I’m so disappointed because it’s one of the reasons I bought it. When I contacted Lyft customer support, their representative said it’s not comparable even though the app description said it is, and other people I know who have the exact same phone, watch, and cellular carrier can use it without a problem. How can someone working for Lyft not know how to fix this?"
5402,lulubk718,"June 11, 2018",5,"Reliable, trustworthy I could always count on lyfe any state I go to. I appreciate if I have a terrible driver they don’t match me with them anymore. I also appreciate the 10% off promo. That is a plus and make me use lyfe even more."
5403,Ayedianne,"June 19, 2018",5,Easy and reasonable price I’ve always used Uber but the drivers were rude and charged a little more than Lyft. With lyft my drivers are always friendly and accurate. Plus you save a few dollars
5404,Georgwil,"June 22, 2018",5,"Switching drivers Lyft app switched my driver after I waited 7 minutes for my driver to pick me up. My new driver was 10 minutes away, and if I cancelled I would be billed $5 at that point... hope the $5 was worth it Lyft!"
5405,SweetPeaDoc,"June 25, 2018",5,"Wonderful! I always use Lyft when I’m traveling. The people who drive are always so warm and friendly, professional and responsible, and I have always felt safe. It’s a pleasure to chat and get to know each new person!"
5406,DelaPrado,"July 13, 2018",5,"Easy and convenient Today was the first time I’ve used Lyft and it was a breeze to use! Driver’s are polite, quick to arrive, and helpful! This was much more affordable than taking a cab! I am very impressed with the service!"
5407,Betta4real,"July 25, 2018",5,"Consistent professionalism I use LYFT whenever possible when I travel because they prove consistently good, reliable & friendly drivers. Their drivers are happy to be LYFT drivers which makes for happy customers."
5408,MCM822,"August 6, 2018",1,"Do not like the new arrange a ride screen I do not like the new set-up. It is no longer user friendly for pick-up location and destination at all. You have to do too much to navigate to get to a section where you can actually type your pick-up location. It also no longer give clear notification that the ride is in route. It use to say that, it no longer does. I do kit last JR the guessing factor."
5409,New York Is Too Much Sometimes,"August 10, 2018",5,Lyft is better than Uber and yellow cabs Ride sharing is the future. Yellow cabs are the past. The government stinks for creating laws that cause hurdles for drivers. Screw the taxi union. NYC Taxis needs to get with the times and evolve to compete with Uber and Lyft. Otherwise they will disappear into the dustbin of history.
5410,Nikniknak,"September 19, 2017",5,"Hangs on ""locating nearby drivers"" I updated the app today and like many other users it's stuck on finding nearby drivers for 10 min.  When I finally cancel the search I get a $2 fee! It's the Lyft app."
5411,Heidjdojsixjcxozrandom,"September 28, 2017",5,Nice app. Good for college students This has a deal with my school for $5 off any ride to or from my school. I use it to get coffee from a Starbucks that is too far to walk to but still close enough to get to with the $5 discount.
5412,AMMarsland,"October 9, 2017",5,GPS is not working I called 3 different drivers and they have had no luck finding my pickup location using the lyft gps. I missed an appointment  because of this! Please fix this issue for everyone’s sake!!!
5413,Sheila0e,"November 19, 2017",1,"HORRIBLE SERVICE Lyft has absolutely horrible service, their drivers are rude and they cancel rides because they don’t want to take the trip and lyft does NOTHING to refund your money back. They have no live customer service team. They give you these numbers to call which are just automated recordings that just give you the run around about going online and sending a written report. And they dont respond in a timely fashion. Lyft is absolutely horrible."
5414,Raebae24,"November 19, 2017",5,Not working When i try to get into the app
5415,Squihy,"January 30, 2018",1,"Rip Off corporation/Management Well over priced. Usually twice as much as uber. But I can also understand the independent contractor part, but really? Who’s my fee going to; that independent contractor or the rip off higher up?"
5416,webjefa,"February 21, 2018",4,"LYFT app is fine until it does not work The LYFT app works well enough until it doesn’t. Several times I’ve encountered a problem where the app was down - with an accompanying vague message. I don’t know if this is only at peak times, but in any event it is very annoying."
5417,shelbyrosecurren,"March 19, 2018",5,"Good & bad Similarity to Uber, it is very frustrating that a trip cannot be edited. More frustrating than Uber is that to cancel to reset, I have to pay a $5 fee. This is absolutely absurd and will be the reason I discontinue my use of the app."
5418,Michaelthecre8r,"March 25, 2020",1,"Second card, same billing information? This has to be one of the most frustrating ignorant features I’ve seen on any app when it comes to security. I live alone and don’t have a second card what am I supposed to do? Someone crashed into my car and totaled it how am I supposed to get to work now? Replace this ignorant feature because it hinders many people from being able to use your app I assume."
5419,sturdysteppa,"March 1, 2020",4,Drop off? I would give it a 5 star rating but this drop off setting got to go if I put in a destination of where I want to go i should be dropped off exactly where I wanted and not a block or two away from I’m suppose to be at.
5420,Amperie,"February 26, 2020",1,Constantly cancels my rides Multiple times now it has me waiting for a driver for ten minutes then it cancels my ride. Send me another driver for ten minutes then cancels again. Has had me waiting for half an hour in downtown SF. Literally a block away from your HQ. You think they’d get it right in their home turf. Seriously?!  I am now typing this from my Uber which got here in three minutes with no problems.  I’m done with lyft
5421,chadillac910,"February 22, 2020",5,"Thankful I use these ride hail apps so much. Sometimes I’m so thankful everything is within our reach so fast. Even if the individual rides aren’t a perfect experience, you can’t beat the ease of use."
5422,Lqhoho,"February 7, 2020",1,"Does customer service exist I’ve been trying to add my Chase Sapphire card to this stupid app for 2 weeks. I’ve written customer service, I’ve sent them a screenshot of the error. I’ve signed out and signed in. I’ve deleted and redownloaded. How can something as simple as adding a payment method (and yes, I know how to do it and yes, the card works) be so flipping hard?!?"
5423,NewLyftFan,"February 3, 2020",5,"My First Lyft Ride Tired of shrinking taxi availability.  Tried Lyft for the first time today by scheduling a ride.  On time, clean (beautiful) car, personable driver.  Will schedule my next ride for later this morning.  Won’t be using a taxi to get to the airport on Thursday."
5424,Formernytapuser,"February 2, 2020",4,Great most of the time This app works well and the service is good most of the time. Only down side is when drivers cancel on you or are assigned from really impracticable locations and you have little recourse on your end to fix the situation.
5425,Dwhiy,"January 28, 2020",1,Lyft has just cut the driver pay by 50% Boycott Lyft!  They used to be a good company now that they went public they are greedy.  Lyft has just cut the driver pay by 50% to 50 cents a mile and are pocketing the rest.  The government deduction is 58 cents per mile.  We now are paying Lyft 8 cents a mile to work for them! I quit after 5 years!  Do not support these greedy people!  You can not get a hold of anybody to e-mail them or call them.  I need my tax information!
5426,Lilliana S.,"January 14, 2020",1,. What I don’t like is that they put a pending hold on my card even though I paid with the gift card that I purchased online and now I have to wait 5-7 to get my money back. They have to have a card on file unlike Uber where as I can buy a gift card online and apply the credits straight to the app without having a credit card on file and getting a pending charge for every ride I take.
5427,naomisangle,"January 12, 2020",5,Thank you Thank you for always having a fast reliable ride for me but I do take them so much id like to start seeing a happy hour or more coupons in this app
5428,Kushaiah,"January 11, 2020",3,Had a Spark when ya started but now u just garbage Lyft is too expensive when the weather is unfavorable.  It can be mildly cloudy with 20% chance of snow and the prices sky rocket. 
5429,funnystyle70,"January 2, 2020",5,"Great!! Me and my wife are here in Seattle on vacation and we have used Lyft a few times they have been great every time! Fast pick up times and great drivers, clean cars I would absolutely recommend them!!"
5430,DaddyNumber1,"December 25, 2019",3,"Flat rate I am on a budget and your flat rate to and from work is needed. When you took that away and raised the monthly membership to $20 appear to discourage from using you. However, since calling taxis at the base, they offer a cheaper price without having to pay extra per month."
5431,sagesiren,"December 14, 2019",5,"Best Ride App Love this service the best out of any other ride apps. Lyft is better than Uber in my opinion, the drivers are always safe and nice! I feel more comfortable with Lyft than any other services comparing to the price and time saver!"
5432,xfactor747,"December 13, 2019",5,"Good Drivers I have had good luck with my last 2 lift rides,only one rude one yesterday,who rushed my out of his car,because he had another customer waiting,overall a very good experience."
5433,Longtower,"December 12, 2019",5,It’s the way to -go-! Consistent easy to use interface that is often accurate 
5434,HangPlayer,"December 3, 2019",5,"Easy to use The app is extremely easy to use and I seldom experience glitches. I find the gps works well, even when not connected to WIFI, as compared to Uber."
5435,mxpwr212,"November 20, 2019",2,"Customer service is terrible I had a scary ride experience and the ability to report it effectively was difficult. The Safety department barely speaks english. The issue was lost in translation making a horrible situation, even worse. "
5436,beats hitchhiking,"November 14, 2019",5,"Hassle free and great value The Lyft app is so easy to use! In my experience, their fares are lower than some other ride services by as much as $20 or more. I have always had pleasant and friendly drivers with clean cars."
5437,sjs me,"November 7, 2019",5,Easy And good service. Thank you for the prompt service and letting me update the ride long after the drop off when I am done with the business of the day.
5438,Big mama tabor,"October 31, 2019",5,Scheduling pick ups I appreciate being able to schedule a pick up days in advance especially when I am out of town! Great option.
5439,Disco 65,"October 27, 2019",5,"Happy customer I have taken Lyft for at least two years now.  Always pleased with the drivers I have had so far. Clean cars, friendly drivers and prices are always reasonable!!"
5440,A2Babs,"October 25, 2019",5,"Messages to drivers It would be very helpful if you could deliver the text messages to the drivers with audio, so they don’t have to take their eyes off the road."
5441,random 32,"October 25, 2019",1,"Love the Drivers, hate the App I’ve only had pleasant driver experiences with lyft. I liked my drivers, but the use of the app itself and the algorithm is a nightmare. It has no sense of how close or far things are so it’s estimates are way off. When finding a new driver, it takes longer and longer and it never finds an available one when redirecting to a new driver. I hate using the app but again all the drivers I’ve had are great."
5442,Skarbeczku,"October 22, 2019",5,Easy to use Easier to call for a ride without the need to stop at a atm machine and pay for it. So far had friendly clean drivers  Will continue to use this app
5443,antigua268,"October 19, 2019",5,"Thank you, Bob!!! Bob you were super friendly on our short ride as we celebrated our second wedding anniversary! Wishing you all the very best with your recent nuptials. Thank you former your upbeat attitude and super clean car! "
5444,lcerrate,"October 17, 2019",3,Cancel rides There is no place in your app to ride about a driver that cancel you and make you wait 1/2 hr. 
5445,CathyJoDiaz,"October 17, 2019",5,"Lyft is EASY & Fast & DEPENDABLE!! 👍🚗👏 We travel a lot and I go to my OrangeTheory Fitness Class EVERY morning and Lyft has become my “Go To” way to get around if I need a Ride!!

5446,sidnfjeidbejdj,"October 10, 2019",3,App pick up location changes Had a lot of issues with changing my pick up location on the app. Took 3 drivers to find me and multiple phone calls. Need to get that figured out. It was after a dodger game so maybe that was the issue but was very frustrating
5447,Marcime,"October 4, 2019",5,Great 1st experience! So I took Lyft for the first time today! I was a little nervous but that all went away the minute I got in the immaculately clean car and the very friendly and helpful driver!!! Great experience!!! I will travel with Lyft again!!!
5448,meggjane8,"September 27, 2019",5,Just wondering Does lyft ask the driver to ask the passenger where they are going? It seems Like every time I get in the car they ask me where I’m going... I’m like it’s already in the app just drive please
5449,rileyrd,"September 25, 2019",5,Perfect ride!!!! Dennis is incredibly sweet and gets the prize for the best smelling car ever. Usually fragrances cause me to have terrible headaches but whatever he was using was insanely appealing! He is exceptionally pleasant. Thank you Dennis for being such a friendly and wonderful driver!
