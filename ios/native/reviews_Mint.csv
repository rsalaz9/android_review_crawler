0,YungWad,"August 27, 2019",5,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! I’ve been with several service provider sprint, at&t, and T-Mobile. I worked in a phone repair store and offered other prepaid services , I must say MINT has been the best ! For the price you get it for how can you complain. The block plans are what made me intrigued with the company and what they offer . I was recently laid off from work and got tired of paying T-Mobile nearly $150 a month for 1 phone on the plan . So I unlocked my iPhone 8 Plus and got a MINT started card . I Tried it out for a week with their trial and I must say , I was getting the same signal strength and data speed as T-Mobile . So I got the 3 month $60 promo plan with 8GB of data . Besides watching my data usage, I’m used to unlimited data the overall of the service is amazing . I’m glad I made the switch and definitely will be referring a lot more people to the company ."
1,Ashaleymusic,"August 12, 2018",5,"So excited! I recommend not porting your old number I tried porting my old number, which was a big mistake, this is a very cheap service and it comes with the price of activities your new number glitching out and making you wait days after you’ve purchased your plan. When switching from porting old number to taking a new number, that took 4 days talking to customer service to work out. So having said that, just skip trying to keep your old number and enjoy the benefits of a cheap and good service. $25 a month for unlimited 10gb is insane and I can hotspot it to my laptop. No overage charges and slowed down data afterwards. T mobile service! Which is no Verizon obviously but for the price it’s amazing.  Thank you Richard at customer service for being the only one who got it to work. Now that it works I’m so happy with it."
2,jkreth,"December 15, 2019",5,"Top MVNO provider Full disclosure — I am no longer a Mint customer, but only because I live in an area that doesn’t have good cellular coverage from T-Mobile (their coverage maps are overly optimistic/generous). I’m a fan of MVNOs, and I wanted try out the Mint plan, as they offer a price point that is an outstanding value. I had some difficulty with the initial port-out, but that was caused by Sprint telling me that my phones were unlocked, which wasn’t true. After solving the port-out issue, we got to try out the service. Unfortunately, it wasn’t right for our family due to our location, but true to their word, they refunded my purchase. Kudos to Mint for sticking to their 7-day money back guarantee. "
3,PLUVC1993,"March 5, 2020",5,Worth the change I was a little hesitant at first...I have had ATT for years and was paying $165 a month for two phones for the unlimited plan. The only reason I had the unlimited plan was because of daughter who is constantly watching videos on her phone. Well my daughter now has her own plan so it was time to start shopping for a new plan. My girlfriend has had Mint Mobile for a few months now and loves it. So I decided to give it a try....what can I say. I am sold...never have problems making calls or texting. The data I use is probably no more than 6 gigs a month because I am always on wifi....and don’t really watch videos on my phone except on WiFi. Now I pay $300 for the whole year for 12gigs of data a month. How can I complain....money in the bank.
4,Michael Kirkman,"November 23, 2019",1,"Poor Service & Poor Customer Service Waste of money. My service was great for the first couple weeks, then my calls were consistently dropped within 60 seconds, and I could not use data at all (when well within my limit). When going back and forth with customer service and even getting ignored at one point, I did everything to fix the service issue and it didn’t work. Then when I tried to get a refund I was denied and told their policy states I was outside of my window to get a refund. A horrible window of opportunity for a refund when the service becomes awful midway through the 3 months I bought and I tried handling within the second month, how can you not refund that? Don’t waste your time, the service is awful and they won’t give you your money back if you experience such poor service. You get what you pay for, but they could at least reconcile really poor service issues. If I could at least get my money back I’d be happy to remove this review."
5,arrrrt,"June 16, 2019",3,"Lacking Features I am critiquing this app based on my past experience with numerous carriers and their apps. What I quickly noticed about this Mint Mobile app is it’s strength is in helping you set up a new service and/or selling you additional services. It is EXTREMELY LACKING in easily informing you on the important information as to how much data you have used, texts used, and minutes used. I’m assuming that since texts and minutes are unlimited Mint doesn’t feel like we really need to know this."
6,J-LeTHaL-,"February 2, 2019",5,"I Love This Company I've been using Mint for two years now and as long as you can get a T-Mobile signal where you live they have the best prepaid prices around. I've never had any problems, their app and website always work, and their plan selections are great. It's good to see they are growing, which will probably bring even better deals in the future, and I'm really happy that the annoying problem I had where you always had to re-type your password every time you went to open the app has now been fixed. Not many companies listen to their reviewers and fix small things like that so it's greatly appreciated. You can buy a 12 month plan and feel confident knowing you're going to get your money's worth."
7,Brownbear628,"December 27, 2017",1,"Horrible customer service! Wifi calling not supported on iOS! Tried this out with high hopes of replacing my AT&T service but what a waste of time. I found out that wifi calling is not supported on iOS devices for some reason. When I called them to inquire further, they said they didn’t know if or when they’d offer that. That’s pretty much a must have feature these days because you rarely get full bars inside a building, especially when visiting remote areas with limited coverage. When I asked the rep on the phone to verify that my service cancellation request had been received and was being processed he told me he couldn’t see anything I may or may not have done through their website on his system. That means their site is not integrated with their call center systems! What a joke. I didn’t expect the moon given their low prices but this really is a chop shop of an operation."
8,gunderson00,"March 18, 2019",5,"Very good, all-around service provider Preface by saying I used to sell cellular service for the big 4 networks, as well as many MVNO pre paid providers, during my time with a nationwide electronics retailer. "
9,bboxx1,"May 12, 2018",3,"Setup and price is good, but I’d like WiFi calling for iPhone I purchased the MintSim trial kit for $10, and after testing it out and picking a plan, I was refunded the $10 back for the trial kit - Not bad! Setup was a breeze and porting my number from Verizon was pretty straight forward. The broken-down monthly cost of Mint Sim is hard to beat - it’s so great that I almost don’t mind the service being a bit spotty in some areas and getting 0 bars inside various buildings. I feel like this aspect could have easily been forgiven if I at least had a WiFi Calling option for my iPhone; however, this is not currently available for Mint Sim. I’m now looking into another MVNO that might be a little more expensive, but at least has WiFi Calling for iPhone."
10,YuriPetrov123,"January 26, 2018",5,"Simply amazing I was on a T-Mobile individual prepaid plan and I was looking for a way to get a T-Mobile (or, any other network’s) family plan price without the need to actually set up such a “family” with my friends. That’s when a quick Google search leaded me to Mintsim. It was an easy decision for me to switch to Mintsim because they were offering me more for less money (I am on a 10gb, 12 months plan now) and because that’s essentially the same T-Mobile network."
11,CRJ2018,"August 12, 2018",5,"Basic service for an unbeatable price The app works pretty well for account management. It's no-frills, just like the service. The whole point of Mint is to get T-Mobile service at a dirt cheap rate. DON'T sign up if you've got a complicated account with tons of lines and you travel internationally a lot. DO sign up if you want a simple bill for great service and you're willing to swap SIMs when traveling internationally. Also, you'll need YouMail for visual voicemails. I would say you need a little bit of technical knowledge to navigate the activation process (or ask your grandson to help)."
12,JDAY316,"September 29, 2018",5,Great service all the way around !! Customer service and cell service is awesome !! 
13,Jstelari,"April 11, 2019",5,"Great Service Mint uses T-Mobile network so the coverage is excellent. The price is great and I couldn’t find anything as good. Unlimited calls + 3GB internet is great for only $15. Initially you get that price if you pay 3 months upfront. Then I think you have to pay a whole year to keep it (otherwise it goes to $25, still a good deal). But $180 to not have to bother with a telephone bill is awesome. "
14,RadMatty,"February 3, 2020",4,"Works Great for Me! I live in a small town in rural southeastern Wisconsin and have great coverage in all the places I normally frequent.I have noticed some gaps in the coverage when I get really far out in the back country, but it is nothing that affects my day-to-day enjoyment of this service. I had no problem porting my number over to Mint Mobile. It was handled very quickly. I also am able to enjoy Wi-Fi calling on my iPhone. Thanks to this feature I am able to run with a 3GB plan and never come close to running out of data. I had some questions when I first started. I had no problem getting prompt help from customer service."
15,marshmallowworld,"August 18, 2019",1,"Horrible I have only three days left of the three months using this service provider. They have cut the data each month saying that all data has been used. I have never used more than six gb of data on cell phone plan and this a 12gb plan. I downloaded an app to ensure that the data use has been accurately measured. A huge discrepancy. I suggest not using them unless you plan on using only a third of data you pay for. Funny thing is when all the bars were solid black, data service never worked. When I called they said the phone is the problem.  "
16,DougEFreshyy,"January 13, 2020",5,"Mint is the new way to do mobile Mint provides excellent service at a fraction of the price. Do your plan the way you want to. This is the way it should be. Their app is very easy to use and incredibly convenient. They understand that we want things to be simple, straightforward and easy. No hidden cost, excellent deals and easy add ons. I have honestly been telling my friends and family about, yes it’s that good. Cell service is reliable and data performance is great. Thank you Mint Mobile for providing amazing service at a fraction of the price."
17,org'fb,"October 5, 2019",5,"Could be better, but satisfied Would be excellent if you supported e-sim. I can’t see why foreign companies (Ubigi) can offer e-sim for data, but a company in the USA cannot?"
18,rishmalho,"September 26, 2019",5,"They keep most of their promises So first up, I’ve been using them for around 6 months now & I live in a super crowded area. Impressed that the signal either doesn’t drop or recovers super quick."
19,McKenna Hodgson,"February 16, 2020",5,"App works well, service is even better! I enjoy the user interface of the app, ease of use, and color scheme. "
20,zhou_hye,"May 31, 2018",5,"surprised good services I used mint in 2017 and picked it again in 2018. Mint mobile has a lot improvement in 2018 and I am glad. They sent me a package with 3 SIM cards. Trial sim, original sim and replacement sim. This improvement is so so careful . I just started the trial. To be honest, the previous experience with mint was ok. The 4G data was slower that 4G data of other carriers but with half of the price . The rate was slower but bearable. Hope it is getting batter in 2018 for the data part."
21,jrusso01,"June 13, 2018",4,"Great Service Great service, and I really appreciate the upgraded account management screen. I would appreciate a widget for the today screen, though (if that’s what it’s still called). Also, I know this is probably very hard due to Apple’s control over everything, but I would also appreciate visual voicemail. WiFi calling would also be a nice plus. I also appreciate the developer response to my last review. I know it was probably just cut and paste, but it still made my opinion feel heard."
22,Jamesefe,"November 22, 2018",5,Best Value No Contract Service I signed up for Mint a month ago because I needed another phone line and didn’t want a contract.
23,Hashem Khadra,"December 9, 2018",5,"Excellent service I switched from sprint and got the 20 5gb got 3 month and I’ve been testing the speed for over a week, excellent service no issues what so ever and I’m getting 3 times the speed of sprint download is between 15 all the way up to 50 and upload is a bit slower however I didn’t feel it effected me at all wish I knew about them long time ago if ur area is covered don’t think twice it’s just says mint instead of the big 3 or 4 besides that reliable service at a fraction of the price"
24,smv1111,"April 12, 2019",4,"Switched from AT&T Loving Mint so far.  Switched from a shared AT&T family plan & am saving some minty cash.  I’d like to suggest an app feature for your next upgrade:  to be able to turn the data on/off via a button in the app.  AT&T has this in their app, and it is super helpful when I need to get my teenager’s attention or get him to take a break.  Also, as the bill payer, it would also be nice to pay/control multiple accounts/numbers through my app like a master account.  Thanks!"
25,cwru-kj,"May 2, 2019",1,8Go gone in 24hrs and no explanation I emailed them because I received a text saying that I ran out of data 24hrs after my data was renewed. It’s obviously a glitch. I have been a customer since September back when my plan was only 5Go I would never use the whole balance as I am always on WiFi. So if I can’t fully use 5Go in one month how come I used 8Go in 24hrs ? It does not make sense.
26,Prov3567,"August 20, 2019",5,"Finally off The juice I have been paying for the most expensive service for years. The reception at my home was getting worse and worse, so after a lot of research we switched to mint. It has been amazing!!! It took 10 min not the usual hours and I didn’t have to talk to anyone. Seemed almost too easy. Even my wife asked “that’s it?” They gave me a trial sim, which I loved so I quickly swapped to the permanent sim. The service is great!!! Do you self a favor, switch as fast as you can. Great service can come at a great price."
27,Aero Stone,"December 17, 2019",5,"A Mint Deal This cellular service is easily as good as the big names in the industry, like Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, etc. The only difference being that you pay for your plan upfront with a credit card, as opposed to being billed monthly, but I don’t mind that because my cell bill now averages just $15 per month for unlimited talk & text with 3 GB of 4G data speed. Why pay the big name cell companies 3X as much, when the service from MInt is just as good or better? It was a no brainer for me to switch to a Mint cellular plan."
28,boooyeah,"January 19, 2020",5,"Mint Mobile Is Very Minty! So far it’s worked reasonably well, it’s definitely not the best but for what you pay it’s the bomb! That’s a good thing for all you more seasoned folks! The first three months are golden! Their tech support is second to none! So far it looks like I’m going to be supporting Deadpool aka Wade Wilson aka Ryan Reynolds for the foreseeable future!  Hopefully Mint Mobile will start pulling enough new users to start a Cell Phone war and prices will go down even more! These phones really dig into your personal budget!"
29,TamimS2000,"April 2, 2020",5,Only the Very Best!!! I have used T-mobile before and let me tell you. Ever since I have been a mint mobile customer I never went back. Mint mobile is cheaper and still has the same coverage. The pricing is awesome too and not like other companies charging $60 plus per month. Mint mobile is going to wipe those old competitors out. Don't be surprised when mint mobile becomes the next big dog and its because they’re putting their customers needs first.
30,elFeisto,"October 23, 2018",5,"Great Service I’ve had Sprint, T-mobile, and AT&T. I haven’t had a single issue and while it is a little tricky getting minor issues resolved, nothing that mint could control, I am paying $25 a month and I can wait a bit for the issue to be resolved."
31,reag12,"December 15, 2018",5,"“Mint Mobile” vs “AT&T” I switched from AT&T and I got 3 months and I’ve been testing the speed for over a week, excellent service no issues what so ever I’m getting full bars signal (AT&T only get 1 bar and sometimes “NO SERVICE” from AT&T) wish I knew about them long time ago if your area if covered don’t think twice it’s just says “Mint Mobile” full signal and excellent reliable service for a fraction of the price"
32,arp734,"March 27, 2019",5,I love Mint Mobile! Meant mobile is awesome I love it! Meant mobile uses the T-Mobile network. If your phone is unlocked from AT&T for example you can use Mint Mobile. Cheap plans to buy in bulk. They even offer trial SIM card To test your device. And now they have Wi-Fi talk and text. Why stay with T-Mobile? Instead switch to Mint Mobile and pay for the same great service but for a whole lot less!
33,Agent Green Fox,"March 30, 2019",5,"Get Mint Mobile I am satisfied with the service Mint Mobile provides and love the pricing options. After switching from Total Wireless to Mint Mobile, I have cut off $200 off of my annual phone bill. "
34,burton.clocksin,"April 25, 2019",5,"Great service, and wonderful delivery Moved from H2O to Mint, and have been completely satisfied. I’m used to not paying a lot for monthly plans, but Mont managed to beat the price I was paying previously, and supported Wi-Fi calling, texting, MMS, group text messaging, and FaceTime, all of which H2O didn’t provide. It is great to pay a fraction of the price of large franchise companies, while still having all the perks. Great job guys!"
35,Captain Hastings 2008,"May 10, 2019",5,Everyone should get a mint mobile sim We are new to the USA and needed a US phone number and mint was by far the easiest and actually the cheapest option. I would recommend it to anyone even the international calls we need to make are ridiculously cheap so I would probably recommend to my friends who come visiting to hook themselves up with a US phone for the trip!
36,SamReview-,"December 8, 2019",5,"WiFi Calling and text is active ! I’ve read people reviews WiFi call and text are not active, the review from 2018. "
37,vj4gj,"February 22, 2020",5,"Your dollar really worth with Mint Sim I used to pay more than double than I’m paying Mint mobile to my previous service provider just for 2GB a month and even that 2 GB I wasn’t using well because the internet speeds were very slow when I really wanted. But with 8GB plan with Mint Mobile, internet on my phone is really becoming available and useful for me... thanks my dear green fox"
38,ebar 27,"January 22, 2020",5,Best switch ever! I had a friend that wanted to cut back on expenses and came across Mint Mobile. I decided to try it. I switched from AT&T which i was paying  about $75 a month. For the same service  i am only paying  $15 a month and loving it! The switchover was so easy to do. The service has been great with no problems.
39,Drake's iMac,"November 3, 2019",5,Better than sliced bread I have moved my whole family off Verizon to Mint.  Verizon was $280/month for family of 4 unlimited data.  Kids never used more than 12G. One 12G line is ~$280/yr.  You do the math.  Customer service is great.  I tested the service in the UK and have made international calls from US.  Works fine. I live in southern New Hampshire. My daughter is going to school in Atlanta. No complaints!  Thanks Mint!
40,22-89,"September 15, 2018",5,"Excellent service This five-star is given to the great and cheap service, Mint Mobile is the cheapest mobile service for the greatest service that I found in the United States at this point."
41,notjaden,"December 28, 2018",5,"Surprisingly— is great! I was sketched out by how cheap the pricing was. I never use data so I opted for $45 (3 months worth of service at 2 GBs/month) but I am a little confused as to why my next payment due is $69 instead of $45, but with that said the service works great and I’m saving a ton. The starter SIM kit came via fedex and was very cute. I had T-Mobile"
42,Kouponkween,"April 17, 2019",5,Great service I used to be a Straight Talk customer and decided to give Mint a try after many years. Service is just as good as theirs but has the added bonus of a mobile hit spot for much less than I was paying before. I just wish I could get a signal booster to go with as I’ve never gotten good signal inside the house.
43,Rosinski65,"March 9, 2020",3,Service is great. App not so. Been using Mjnt mobile now for almost two months. Had no problem. The older version of the app told you up to date data usage. The updated app isn’t accurate. It tells me I have more data available than what I used. This needs to be fixed. I know I used a 400mb but it still shows what I had at the beginning of the day not minus the 400mb. Also make the data usage 2 decimal points.
44,MXYoshi,"March 5, 2020",5,Great service and price Has saved me a lot of money in the long run. Buying data in bulk is genius and the app is easy to use
45,Stevoggg,"January 12, 2020",5,"I was scared I’ve been with Verizon for years and years playing my arm my leg and both heads for service. And for one payment that I made to Verizon I paid for a whole year of service with Mint, The activation process was a too good to be true feeling cuz it was perfect and simple. And I’ve had them for about a month and couldn’t be any happier."
46,JerBear48,"October 2, 2019",5,"Best Decision Ever I’m saving hundreds a year by doing this, I was paying 100 a month at Verizon for 2gb and my phone bill, so by paying the 300 left on my iphone 8 and doing the 180 a month for 3gb with Mint, I’ve moved from paying about 1200 a year to 500 up front which is so much nicer. It’s an even better deal if you already own your phone."
47,atomsnine,"August 12, 2019",5,"Solid Cellular Service; Clean App Both the MintMobile cellular service and their app are good quality. Cellular service is decent to good. From what I understand, Mint service rides on TMobile’s network so, from what I can tell, the cellular/LTE service is on par with a full-price-paying TMobile customer. A pleasant trial experience and a significantly lower cost made the decision to switch easy."
48,Burki590,"January 10, 2020",5,"Good Job, Mint! Mint makes it easy to switch: Great offers and pricing, easy and fast to set up, good service! Don‘t regret it so far and will recommend to others definitely!"
49,Mg1078,"July 2, 2019",5,"So far so good..... I’ll update later if I change my mind.  Live in Houston, not sure about remote coverage but were i’m at is decent.  For most younger folk set up will be a breeze.  About a week in and 1 thing is for sure, price can’t be beat, got the promo for 1 Andrew Jackson a month it’s unlimited T/T with 8gb data.  Hopefully coverage stays decent."
50,docmom4,"February 15, 2018",5,"YES! Finalllly! I have an Apple 5s & it works just fine. I didn’t want an obnoxious pymt, nor, do I need more than 2Gb...there’s WiFi everywhere. I just did several days in Austin on the Trial &had perfect service. Better, in fact, than Sprint. Just paid for 12 mos for $180 & I have NO MORE PHONE pymts for a YEAR!!! That’s less than 2 mos for Verizon💪🏼"
51,raichu.16,"June 20, 2018",5,Amazing! I got the 10GB plan and so far its been a dream. No issues with of the service. The data is fast and amazing. I am always getting good reception on the phone even at home. Highly recommend it to anyone! It saves lots of money! Customer service was also helpful when trying to set up my SIM card.
52,TPARK08,"July 8, 2018",1,"No success. Bad customer service. I used the trial and it worked fine. Then I tried to port my number over from Verizon, and all fails from there. It didn’t work at first and the app was saying it was in progress and then nothing. No confirmation on its progress or not. I reached out to customer service and they just blew me off and told me to try this and that. I tried doing what they suggested 3 separate times with no success. After hours of failed attempts, I gave up and just want my money back. Still no success and I’m awaiting my refund....."
53,rainbowparty,"March 18, 2020",5,Same service as many competitors for LESS Perfect for people wanting prepaid service. If you want prepaid go to this company.
54,Ken Ivey,"August 26, 2019",5,Easy to switch and glad I did. Great price and service. I had reservations about porting my number but it was a seamless process that took only a few minutes. (iPhone)
55,nybenzi,"October 20, 2019",5,"Awesome Unlike other prepaid carrier, Mint Mobile is the best. I have been using it for less than a month but find the signal and the sound quality are very good. You also get the best deal if you get 12 month plans. I find the company is very innovative. I highly recommend!"
56,DaddySnail,"March 21, 2020",5,"First app store review I’ve done And they are worth it. Stop shopping, Mint will take care of you. They even refunded me when my kid accidentally bought an extra year plan. No fuss. Great customer service. And offering unlimited data for no extra charge for COVID-19 is just the icing on the cake. Keep up the great work guys."
57,VMP74,"March 2, 2020",2,Bugs For the past month or so I have not been able to do anything on the app. At first it wasn’t allowing me to change payment or plan options. Now it’s not allowing me to sign in. It says that I have an incorrect password or account. After hitting IForgotPassword it tells me that it doesn’t recognize my phone number. I went to the mobile site through safari and was able to login just fine.
58,Cocoa 1966,"August 18, 2019",5,"New to mint This service is awesome, I haven’t had any problems , you just need to have your account number and pin ready and know the business hours of the carrier you are leaving and try to port at least a week prior to the end of your cycle, all these things keeps it simple. I AM ONE VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER, THANKS MINT FOR THE FRESHNESS."
59,Boh3180,"August 3, 2019",5,"Great quality service at ridiculous price! After being with one of the major carriers for many years, I made the switch to Mint Mobile and am very pleased. Only regret - should have switched years ago!!  Keep up the great service Please!!"
60,Posh Penguin,"January 22, 2018",5,"Easy Setup Easy setup — took maybe 10 minutes. I switched from T-Mobile so the transition was seamless and no change in network, which has been great. And to think just over a year ago I was paying $100/month for AT&T. Thanks Mint."
61,Mikejc Bay Area,"November 3, 2018",5,Painless Cell Service Mint is the best cell service I have had since my first phone way back when. Performs better than my old big blue and easy to check on usage. Can’t beat the value. Love the attitude of Mint as well. They put a little fun back in life!
62,terry.mcshan,"December 29, 2018",4,"Needs just a little help, but great!!! Great service and alright app. Just wish it would keep me logged in and that it would automatically show me my data minutes. Right now you have to go out and come back to check data. Also a widget showing the data would be great. Thanks."
63,Aju1117,"May 5, 2019",5,Working Greaaaaaaat! Going very smooth for the past two weeks since I switched and ported my number. The change was without any glitch and a confirmation came within 24 hours even though it said perhaps a 24-48 hrs time frame.
64,Timmy754,"February 19, 2020",5,YES LAWD I switch from T-Mobile and I am extremely impressed at the ease of access and the service quality.
65,lazrtek,"March 5, 2020",5,"FANTABULOUS!!! I am so happy with Mint!!! I almost cannot believe it! I am saving sooooo much money I keep waiting for something bad to happen and it hasn’t. I have good coverage, no problem with calls and I am now paying less than a third of what I paid before."
66,TonyAMx,"January 13, 2020",5,"It’s awesome!!! Es increíble!!! From the first day I had the coverage and quality excellent, plus a very affordable price. I spend money on other companies with so expensive plans only because I wasn’t in a family plan."
67,T34BPilot,"July 28, 2019",5,Incredible deal! Coverage has been great. Perhaps slightly better than my old Cricket/AT&T service. Also includes WiFi hotspotting at no extra cost. Phone number transfer happened almost immediately. No regrets!
68,dlashworthjr,"March 26, 2020",5,"Great service Been with them for almost 4 years now, could never go back to any of the big four. "
69,Jjwiggy,"December 16, 2019",5,Cheap and Surprisingly Good Very affordable and the service is better for me than what I had with Verizon and at less than half the price. I’m very satisfied already and impressed with the service. At this price I’m never going back
70,Nods clan,"September 16, 2018",5,Works great!! I’ve been looking around to a cheap alternative option for cellphone service. This is far cheaper with well service anywhere I go. I recommend this to anyone who has good Tmobile service in their area.
71,Valdene.,"September 27, 2018",1,Doesn’t wok when you try renew your plan Works fine until the plan expired and I tried renew. They debit my credit card and I’m with my plan suspended for one week until now. I’ve tried call the support team and they said to me that it is a system problem and they don’t have any dead line to solve it. For me this is unbelievable. 
72,bruny gb,"January 21, 2019",4,"Basically T-Mobile T-Mobile service without the T-Mobile price tag. Not 5 stars because the price I paid initially wasn't the actual price, just the promotional offer. Havent had any dropped calls yet or spotty service. Overall good experience."
73,DME_Ski,"April 10, 2019",1,"Trying To Reach Mint Customer Service I have tried contacting Mint because I’m am receiving tons of calls and messages for the previous owner of my new Mint number.  I have not heard back from Mint. I signed up for 6 months. Bad move on my part. I do not recommend Mint.  Other family members who have Verizon don’t get this happening to them.  Also, they get better data speeds.  Don’t get Mint.  They recycle the former customers numbers sooner than LEGALLY ALLOWED."
74,jemanko27,"November 23, 2019",5,Stop wasting money on major carriers Saved money and very user friendly app that was easy to install without talking to twenty humans on the phone (talked to no one!!) and kept my phone number in a matter of minutes.
75,Lilinpha,"April 25, 2020",5,"I love the UI/UX My friend recommended me this wireless company when I move to New York City, I really think is worth it. I can’t believe I paid $65 a month for At&T last four years."
76,Bholly8,"February 16, 2020",5,Better than att It’s cheaper than att. Service is the same and you can pay for an entire year if you want to. No worries about paying month to month. Easy switch over. Do it!
77,Emulaay,"September 12, 2019",4,"Customer service could be better Tried to call for a simple question about my shipping and gave up after being on hold for 20 minutes. Other than that, it’s a cheap plan, I just started so we’ll see how it goes 👍🏻"

90,PopoJoe1413,"January 1, 2019",1,"Too good to be true I received my sim for the &20 for the month holiday promotion and when I tried to use it, it wouldn’t work. I called Mint and they said they would have a tech contact me within 24 hours to fix the problem or they would send another SIM card. That was 4 days ago and I still haven’t heard anything. Looks like I will eat that $20 and go with some other carrier."
91,RandyRandersonman,"March 9, 2019",5,Great - Suggestion The app is fantastic! I’d love to be able to track data usage through the Notification Center. That would be helpful.
92,markbyrn,"May 13, 2019",4,"Intro Pricing Great The $45 for three months inc 3GB per month is great and it’s very handy to use on my backup phone.  The regular $75 price is too much though for that purpose, and so I’ll have to get a new another $45 SIM package if available."
93,Bigbear440,"May 27, 2019",5,Excellent service Don't know why I waited so long. Excellent service everywhere I go. I was paying one month at Verizon what I get three months on Mint. Definitely renew for the year service!!
94,Geri@,"August 7, 2019",5,Fantastic Fantastic service and price. Best bang for your buck. I transferred my number and here’s a tip. ... get your account # and any pin/ passwords used with your old carrier. My and my wife’s transfer happened instantly.
95,Joonnnahhh,"January 19, 2020",5,Perfect for me Since day one this service has been perfect for me and it’s been almost a year already with mint. I recommend it to everyone i know!

As far as viewing plans and pricing, purchasing, activating and setting up service the app is great and very user friendly. After you have service it’s features and use are severely limited. You can check your account status and next recharge date, change your plan or buy additional data, and check your total data usage and roaming (if you use that). You are not able to see detailed data usage, text usage, call history, etc. Adding those details would make it better. I’d also like to see an in-app chat for customer service vs being limited to phone or email for support. "

204,S Hayman,"March 28, 2020",1,"Hidden fees The app has a lot of glitches, it took multiple tries and even deleting and reinstalling this app multiple times before finally successfully getting my phone up and running. When ordering the “try the service” SIM cards, I ordered two, was charged for five, and actually only received three. I emailed the company and explained what happened. I was told that as long as I have the numbers off of the SIM cards I could get a refund. Well I can’t produce SIM card numbers for something I never received. As stated earlier I ordered two, was billed for five, received three. When I signed up for three months of service (after finding that the service coverage for my area is truly great) they slipped in a $6.25 “”recovery fee”. That was irritating, I mean it’s a pretty sweet deal to get three months service for $45.00 so be honest and tell me from the beginning it’s really $51.25. It’s still a sweet deal to get three months of service for $51.25 and I’d have more respect for an honest up front way of conducting business. After all the little hurdles I’ve had to get over, I’m still happy with Mint and it is going to save me a small fortune. Over the past two years I’ve gone from paying AT&T $700 a month to paying Straight Talk $45 a month to now paying Mint Mobile $51.25 for three months!! Not bad eh? And the service with Mint has AT&T beat by a landslide!"
205,pschotic panda,"February 20, 2020",3,"Works great, but could be better I enjoy the service enough to say I’d recommend it to someone, how ever service can be a little spotty, I noticed that it refuses to load certain apps. I can watch YouTube using cellular and have no lag with 720p quality. But on apps like letgo I sometimes need to message people on the go, my mint service couldn’t be bothered to even try to load the app. I also noticed that at times people have trouble hearing me on their side. Before I transferred to mint Mobil I had no problem with people being able to understand me. It would appear the issue is only outgoing as I can hear the other person clearly. Overall it’s very good for the price, I’d recommend it to someone who wants to save money. However if you need your phone for a living such as business or contract work I’d keep to the big guys for sake of making sure people can understand you let alone hear you. Of course this could be an issue with my area.(Tulsa, Ok)"
206,FilmWonder,"January 30, 2020",1,"Scam They send you a text saying you used 80% of your data.even if you turn off your data, turn off your phone, or remove your SIM card the moment you turn it on you will get a message that you somehow used all your data.if you reach a supervisor they tell you well you only paid x amount so get over it. Or if you try the trial version you need to download the app which makes no sense because in theory you don’t have a phone plan that’s why you purchased their SIM card so how would you have data to download an app???? Complete scam -D on the Better Business Bureau if you need further verification"
207,joonaskristian,"January 18, 2020",5,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE DANGIT!! SIM NOT COMPATIBLE. 
208,Fishahoy,"January 7, 2020",5,"Pretty Awesome I was skeptical at first, after researching it I found that it was the cheapest option out there. I even talked to the Best Buy mobile person trying to find a cheap plan; he even was astonished at how inexpensive it was. After using google fi for a bit I decided that Mint mobile was worth the inquiry. I love it, the signal and data have a great connection. If your looking for an inexpensive plan, then I suggest trying this."
209,Bmyqteepiedj2,"December 25, 2019",5,"Woo Hoo AWESOME I really LOVE Mint Mobile! I have not had one single or multiple issues with this phone service. I was paying over $80.00+ at AT&T for 12GB Unlimited Talk and Text now I only pay $25.00 a month for the same thing!  Only $300 per year opposed to around $960 to $1,000 a year that’s a BIG difference. No drop calls, no static, or sounding like your in a hole! Clear service. I’m so glad I found the fox! THANKS A BUNCH MINT MOBILE KEEP UP THE GREAT SERVICE. 10’s across the board. ;o)"
210,Dyne540,"October 1, 2018",1,Abysmal data speed .01mb/sec no ticket response In SF land of 4g lte. Service can’t load a website like Wikipedia. 
211,Twofiveking,"December 22, 2018",5,"I can’t wait to tell ATT to F off. Jesus 25$ a month seems unbelievable 10gigs a month is plenty I’m using 9 to 11 gigs now for 65$ a month on an unlimited plan with no hot spot. I even called ATT and said unless you renegotiate my price I’m leaving he couldn’t do a thing. I’m looking forward to getting my SIM card. It’s about time there’s a company that’s reasonable. I remember the days when sprint would charge me 25$ for a late fee. They still send me bills. Updated review 12/22/18 after 3 weeks with mint absolutely amazing service mint has saved me 40$ a month and the service works great. Att, sprint and all the other major carriers should all be ashamed of themselves for ripping people off all these years. They will all fold eventually and I won’t feel bad one bit."
212,frustrated_customer1343,"February 13, 2019",1,Does not work in western Illinois I was very excited to try this out however my zip code in Illinois is not served which makes Mint useless here.
213,赫赫赫赫,"March 17, 2019",3,Buggy. 4G LTE balance on iOS app now shows 0 Android app and web site both show the correct amount.
214,Jccmd11,"April 20, 2019",5,"Great service I had ATT, and it was $1350.00 for 2 lines, for 15 months. Mint cost $450.00. $900.00 savings, you have to pay in advance. 3 months and the renew at 12 months. I haven’t found any difference in service. You Keep your old numbers, that’s 3 gb on each line , talk and text all free. Awesome!!"
215,Geno Orl,"May 4, 2019",5,Service I switched to them porting my number over took less then 10 mins service is good spotty some places just like any other service prepaid but overall had them for a month and no disappointment here at all.so give them a try they have a trial so you have nothing to lose.
216,anon113399,"May 5, 2019",3,Great sevice. But Annoyed by few things You guys have great service at really cheap rates. Probably would have given 5 stars if it wasn’t for these annoying things. 
217,saintranger,"June 6, 2019",1,"New to Mint Mobile I switched cell phone carriers to Mint Mobile a little more than a week ago, it’s online only process is streamlined and functional. Initially service worked fine for my needs but lately l’ve notice a delayed response and buffering while trying to review home security videos. There app doesn’t include a means to communicate customer concerns or problems with Customer Services."
218,taqitasliya,"September 12, 2019",5,MB This is way better than Verison and ATT.   Until now I have never had four bars At my house and I live in Silicon Valley. Before Mint Verizon was the only one that worked out at the ranch where my horses live in case of emergency.
219,srulinax,"August 15, 2019",1,"Dumb app and tricky service provider There’s absolutely no necessary info into that app. Nothing that I couldn’t do through the website. Even Touch ID is not yet invented! And Mint service all together is very questionable. I had a kinda few different providers before and I know what 12Gb of data is. I barely used 7Gb a month on my previous plan. Here Gigs are melting with unbelievable speed. Cmon I don’t even stream any music, just some WhatsApp email and 5-10 min YouTube a day and my 12Gb ends up in a two weeks? Really?!? And same shot with roaming. Was in Canada few days. First my phone had a hard time to pick up roaming. It’s frustrating. When connection finally was established my roaming balance began to disappear even faster than my monthly data. I don’t even used it! All the time was on hotels WiFi. Small little foxy might be cute but it likes to steal your money. And you can’t really do something about it!"
220,Ipod2Guser7,"February 18, 2018",2,"No Wifi calling for iOs. I have really bad coverage when I’m in my basement or a really thick walled part of my house. Wifi calling not being included for whatever reason was definitely a deal breaker for me. But why just block wifi calling on iPhones??? You let android phones have wifi calling, I don’t understand."
221,TSo1990,"July 1, 2018",5,Great Works perfectly! But the $5 test kit on Amazon and make sure t-mobiles network works in your area. I’m completely happy with the service and have recommended it to all my family and friends.
