0,dcmsanto,"April 4, 2020",1,"Crappy CUSTOMER SERVICE! Crappy is an understatement! Air BNB is horrendous. Yes, I understand the influx of customers wanting refunds due to the Coronavirus pandemic. However, all of these customer’s should receive their money back. The option of travel credit is also not what I want. They are making it so difficult to get my money back in return because I haven’t given “proper documentation.” That is completely ludicrous! I have sent them documentations of my working in the hospital and my employer stating travel restrictions due to risk of contaminating patients with the virus. I’ve also sent them documentation of my flight being cancelled. My flight and other activities did really well in customer service and being able to return my money in full. But AIRBNB has been so difficult to work with. They have no common sense at all! They are still giving me a difficult time with getting my refund of my money to my card. They instead want to trick you into getting a travel credit for future reservations. Due to their lack of customer service, I told them I don’t intend to make future arrangements with AIRBNB. But they are dragging this on to the point where it’s close to my reservation date. All I want is my money back. I also fall under the extenuating circumstances category, yet still they have been so difficult to work with. And I don’t know what to do. They are really just off to steal my money."
1,Sam Battle,"August 31, 2019",1,The worst service ever!!! Hotels are way better! First off it takes forever for Airbnb support to get back in touch with you. I dealt with a place INFESTED WITH SPIDERS! And it took DAYS to deal with customer service for a solution. They then wanted proof and I sent a pic of one spider and they said it was NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE! Then I sent 4 pics of 4 different spiders and THEH CLOSED MY CASE WITHOUT A RESOLUTION! A hotel would NEVER make a guest prove an infestation to change rooms!!!!! And they wanted me to talk to the host about it like I want to confront someone about their spider infestation in Their home! Thats not my place! I paid hundreds of dollars to be comfortable!
2,$@h67,"December 24, 2019",1,"DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!! I had the worst experience ever! Every year my family makes plans to go out of town to celebrate Christmas, this year we decided Orlando, FL. I heard about AirBnb and decided to check it out. I reserved a house for December 27-January 2 and reserved it on August. I get a text a week before the trip saying the host canceled the reservation. The host didn’t let me know the reason and just canceled. I try contacting the host and he didn’t respond to my calls and text. I call customer service and they tell me it was an emergency and that my money is going to be refunded in 5 to 10 business days. They didn’t give me an explanation at all. I decided to get another house that was $1000 more, but I was ok with it since I had everything paid for and family from another country was coming. 2 days before the trip I get a cancellation message again about my reservation on the new place. This host was decent enough to tell me that he canceled due to the days I reserved for were already booked. Apparently Airbnb showed available rooms that were not really available. Called customer service and they didn’t give me any solutions, just sent me listings of places that were already not available or $5000 more in price. Give me a $200 coupon like that was any help at all. I’m never using this app again and I recommend you do the same."
3,Hoodoo2,"January 14, 2019",1,"Ridiculous So I signed up and attempted to book for the first time about a year later. In the mean time I had canceled the credit card I signed up with. So I attempted to book but it failed because of the credit card. I got an email, a text and a message through the app telling me it failed. I clicked the link in the email which opened the app but there was no indication of how or where to update the credit card. I finally found it, not in account settings, but (strangely) on the page of the failed booking. There was no option to remove a payment method nor to update a credit card. However there was a button to add a new payment method except the feature would not load. I just got the white page and the little animated dots. I tried restarting the app, restarting the phone, updating the app, and tried it on WiFi and cellular all over the course of about 12 hours. Nothing worked. So I logged into the website. There I found an option to delete a payment method but incredibly there was no option I could find to add a payment method. So I contacted customer service. The replied to my message at 4AM the next day but gave me no helpful information. I replied, but didn’t hear back from them for three more days. By then I had already booked with a normal hotel which, of course, was no problem. Good riddance Airbnb."
4,Dustpal,"March 5, 2018",1,"Why yes, I would like to stay 30 minutes away from my destination Something is wrong with the search engine airbnb uses. I put in a City and great, there's like 800 places to pick from. Problem is that most of these locations are 30 minutes away from where I actually want to be. As a traveler, this is mostly inconvenient. So then you have to waste your time checking through each posting to see which one is actually close to where you want to be. Please add a distance filter from the city center to fix this mess. Other room finding applications know how to manage distance, so airbnb is way behind."
5,Ashley K05,"August 13, 2019",1,"Don’t stay with AirBnB I am very disappointed with Airbnb. We had an ant problem in our house, and when I tried to resolve it with the host, she turned on me and blamed us. She said she went above and beyond and that is just not true. Since we didn't think to ""document"" the ants, Airbnb took the hosts' side of the conversation. That is so wrong and has made me never want to use Airbnb again. While the host insulted me as a person and said I was too demanding and minimized what actually happened, Airbnb was no better. They said they had to side with her because I had no pictures. I am sorry but who thinks to take a photo when your hand is covered in ants, and you are just trying to make sure they aren't all over everything you own, which for the record they were. They were in the bed, on my retainer, glasses, clothing, etc. It was one of the most disgusting things I have had to clean. Yes, that's right, we had to clean it because the owner didn't believe in taking a more drastic measure to clean then Windex. Airbnb's customer service was no good either. They made it seem like they empathized with me when they called to hear more information and that they were so sorry, yet they did nothing to rectify the situation. I will never stay with them again. Beware, if anything happens - DOCUMENT IT ALL, otherwise your words mean nothing."
6,Leaux3,"November 14, 2019",1,"Worst customer service ever Let me start by setting the scene.... I am 4 months pregnant and I have a 4 year old son. My fiancé’s bday was the other day and he had to travel to Miami for a work trip so we made a family weekend out of it. The hotel we were staying at was over booked so we decided to try to use Air B and B to find something cheaper that was still local. Downloaded the app, set up a profile and picked a place. Confirmed it and were excited out our new reservation. Not even 15 minutes later we get a message saying our reservation was canceled. Called the hotel and they said the never received the payment so we need to contact air B and B. I contacted them and the lady “couldn’t give me any info” so we waited for a “case manager” to call back. A couple hours later a women who spoke extremely broken English called and said they were sorry they have to cancel the reservation but we broke the terms and agreements.... which I don’t know how when we literally set up the profile properly and verified everything! And booked a place AND THEY TOOK THE NEARLY $200 OUT OF OUR ACCOUNT!!!!!!! They would NOT give us a further explanation at all and the lady would not work with us at all and HUNG UP ON ME! Needless to say they put us in an extremely tight bind and we will never use this app ever again. Beware! Seems pretty scamish."
7,sea225,"June 15, 2018",4,"So far it’s been good, but needs a little work! So far it’s been good, but still has some work to be done On the app ect. sometimes the app crashes or takes a while to update. I get messages way later like a day or 2 later on guests asking me questions. I did notice that it has not been sending the check In information to the guests so they get trapped out side the gate for a while because the messages don’t come in to my phone right when they message. Also I’ve been getting guests having a hard time keeping the booking I get them confirmed and then a day later it’s canceled on them. Guest call me a lot trying to figure out how to book. Maybe make the booking a little easier. Also if you are in a state that they pay the tax for you make sure to look in to it cause they only pay the state tax not the city tax. Wish they could pay that also each quarter for me. I give Airbnb over all a 4 cause it’s good just not yet a 5 yet. Work on app a little more and maybe put a system in that is like doc u sign. that way it just automatically sends the booking waver that we need each guest to sign so I don’t have to do it manually."
8,es-py,"December 25, 2018",1,"Do Not Do Business With This Company My family and I are stranded in an unfamiliar state thanks to Airbnb and their unwillingness to correct their mistakes. Thank you for allowing us to book a condo under construction. Thank for allowing us to find this out after thousands of dollars of airfare, time off and hours driving to the booking. Thank you for failing to send any emails or messages informing us of this issue. Thank you for acknowledging the mistake and shooting down any attempt to accommodate my family by booking us a similar listing even though similar listings were available on your app and website. We were forced to deal with horrible customer service representatives. If anyone at the company is reading this please invest in some workshops/training idk maybe a Christmas bonus or something because dealing with your representatives took this experience to another level of frustration. I would not be sitting here writing this essay if it wasn’t for the young lady I had the pleasure of speaking to last night. Thank you for this experience Airbnb! Who would have thought opening Christmas gifts in rental cars would be so fun! And thanks for the great advice of finding a hotel to accommodate 6 adults on Christmas Eve for 8 days in Orlando. The amount of options were plentiful!!! Thank you! Merry Christmas from our Ford Explorers."
9,ehowle,"August 30, 2018",2,"Cancellation by host Was recently cancelled on for one of our trips. There was absolutely no recourse. I went to your q&a and found out you have a pretty strict set of rules for canceling on the host, but no real strict set of rules on hosts cancelling on guests. This is absolutely horrible. The host only loses the cancellation. The guests lose all that they had invested in the trip - airfare, other places to stay, any reservations and down payments on things like prearranged things or trips such as boating, kayaking, entry fees, etc.  Also I could not leave an Airbnb review on the host. This is absolutely uncalled for. Both the host and Airbnb need to know the consequences of this action. And others need to know that the host cancels on guests.  Airbnb really needs to rethink this policy. If a host cancel, they should be responsible for any costs that the guests incurred. I have heard that hosts will cancel if they get a higher rental fee. Don’t know if that happened to me, but that should absolutely be forbidden and if one cancellation occurs, the host should be moved to the lowest ranking. They must be discouraged from doing any cancellation.  They have to be running this like a business. The excuse I got was the host had to leave town and could not find someone to clean it before the last guest before me. Really poor excuse!!"
10,guesswho!!,"December 28, 2017",3,"Good App, but could improve with some bug fixes Very nice App. Easy to book and communicate with host. But (the current version) could use some bug fixes. I use the App on my iPad Pro with the most recent iOS an when I scroll through my search results, the movement is extremely slowly, sometimes gets even stuck. Something is wrong here. Search filters are also not perfect. When I set for example my limit at $200 per night, the App shows me also accommodations above $200. Also, it would be great if the location filter would be narrower. If I search for housing in a certain town I don‘t want to see housing from near-by towns. Unfortunately, one sometimes only find out once you check the map, because the title often does not tell the location. Maybe adding a distance option would help (how far from target destination the search should be expanded). "
11,Smokentoken123,"January 2, 2018",1,"Nothing but problems I’ve had nothing but problems trying to make a reservation through Airbnb. My first reservation was cancelled due to me not completeing the verification process in time(long story short my account was set to eastern time instead of pacific time) I verified my account no big deal, I called customer service and was instructed to try and re-book, assured that my reservation would go through I did. I then received an email saying I needed to complete the verification process however when I clicked the link in the email I was taken to a page that said “You’re all set” and a button on the bottom saying “finish” I clicked the finish button and was taken to the home screen I assumed there was a glitch in the software somewhere. Three hours later I received an email saying my reservation was cancelled a second time for not completing the verification process in time. I was very confused as I had in fact completed the process and was not given an option to do anything further from the links in their emails. Now I’m being told by customer service to re-book my trip for a third time. I’m unsure if this is how they typically do business but I’ve received little to no help from their customer service team or the case manager assigned to help fix my problem."
12,"Cindy from Palm Desert, CA","May 10, 2018",5,"Loving Airbnb We used Airbnb during our recent holiday in Kona, HI and stayed in 3 different private units. Each was wonderful and had everything we needed including the loan of beach chairs, beach towels and umbrellas. We didn’t cook, but each unit was well appointed with everything we would need and next time we will enjoy creating our own meals at the units and eat out less. We enjoyed visiting briefly with each owner, they were all really nice but not intrusive at all. We went on two excursions recommended and booked through Airbnb. They were great and good value. I would recommend the Wild Dolphin & Snorkeling adventure with Captain Chase and the Local Brews & Poke Flights with Lottie and a wonderful chef and fun bartender at a beautiful golf course. They were both awesome and each was a small group of 5-6 people allowing us to ask our hosts questions and visit with the other guests. We will likely use Airbnb more often, it was super easy to book the units, more fun and less expensive than a hotel. When they say ‘Super Host’ believe it, book it and relax. I’m a fan and sharing our experiences with friends. Mahalo!"
13,DellDyn,"March 10, 2019",3,"Average Overall, I’ve had good experience with Airbnb, and I like the general set up. I do have two major major issues, and that is 1). with the tax collection. My county and total sales tax are 9%, But they only take out 6% and refuse to fix it. This causes me to lose so much money because I have to take it out of my profit and then file with the county and do my state taxes through an accountant because the system is too complex... Major inconvenience... and 2). This is my 2nd home. I do not want to rent it to just “anyone“. VRBO is better because they at least let you see the person‘s full name, and you can Google their information to make sure they are a real person, etc. There are so"
14,Ashley Feliz,"March 23, 2019",1,"Literally -5 stars if it were possible DO NOT USE AIRBNB. They have the absolute worst customer service. They deactivate accounts for no reason. They say you’ll receive a full refund and I have yet to see any of my money. They owe me more than $1,000... with that said please save your time and your money, don’t trust these people. My trip is supposed to be in 2 days I’ve had this booked for a month now and they cancelled my reservation and deactivated my account and I was told I’d receive a FULL refund. As far as the customer service all they say is that they’ll slap a label on it called “urgent” and that they’ll get back to me in 24 hours...got nothing. After I made my SECOND reservation after having my account deactivated, they then accepted my payment and a few minutes later I was told they cancelled my reservation and they’d send me a full refund I called them to see what was going on and where my money was and all they said to me was that he could do nothing about this, he has to send my case to another department and to “rest assured” it’ll be taken care of In 24 hours and as for my money.. as if it can get any worse I was told that my money is “technically in limbo” and that I need to contact my bank, contacted the bank and they said they haven’t gotten anything on their end... AIRBNB WHERE IS MY MONEY!?"
15,foxsoccerruinedstreamingsoccer,"April 20, 2019",1,"Worse experience than I could even imagine What a scam! DO NOT BOOK THIS!!!! It IS A SCAM!!! Unresponsive host ruined my trip to DC and made us late to the event we were in DC to attend. We tried to contact the host for check in instructions, and she did not respond, leaving us with no place to stay. We then had to scramble and find a friend to stay with after we no longer had a place to stay after we reached out to the host Tracy multiple times, via Airbnb messenger and phone, and eventually had to call Airbnb guest relations. The person on the phone (listed on the Airbnb as the host) said they were not the host and I had the wrong number. This is also on the shoulders of Airbnb, because of their negligence I did not know that there were several others who had similar experiences over the last couple months. I asked the very nice non-US based call center employee for an actual management response from Airbnb within 24 hours and never received the call. Airbnb offered nothing in reparations for their role in this issue, considering they have 4 other people who endured similar experiences and yet they gave no sanctions to this terrible host, and they gave me no warning about these issues they have known about for OVER 2 MONTHS, and therefore will be hearing from our attorney shortly for their negligence."
16,Emb 927363404,"April 25, 2019",3,"First experience with Air BnB is so-so I am traveling for just under a month and am using Air BnB for my travels. I am satisfied with most of my stats so far except one. This particular place was so dingy and run down that I immediately knew I did not want to stay there. Right away I contacted the host asking for the payment of my remaining two nights back so I could secure someplace else. She refused. So I contacted Air BnB and they too so long in figuring things out that I was well on to my next location by the time they said they had successfully negotiated a cleaning fee refund ($34). That was laughable. They told me I could dispute it further and asked me what was a fair compensation. I said that the fairest compensation was the two nights I had originally asked for. That would have been around $270. They negotiated some more and ended up refunding me $120. I am not impressed on the time it takes for them to respond and handle things, nor am I impressed with their negotiation skills. The place I stayed in was a dump and the pictures were a complete lie and they did nothing to fix that for future renters. I’ve now stayed in three other locations and I am very pleased with them. I like Air BnB but I don’t like their service."
17,julieandbobk,"May 13, 2019",1,"Terrible site/ company - no stars Spent multiple days calling or on hold with air bnb after they canceled a trip we booked for Key West. Their website allowed us to rent a unit that was not available. We were charged for the unit, then simply sent a text from another vacation site that our reservation was canceled.  No reason why! No one would tell us why, but it was glitch in air bnb software which no one would own up too.  Every case manager I was assigned too told me they would comp us a stay and send us new listings which never happened.  When a listing was sent it was not comparable to our initial booking.  Each day that passed the cost of the available air bnb units would increase in price, but no one would call me back to confirm another reservation.  Each case worker said they would call me back with in an hour.  No call backs! I am livid with air bnb, there are multiple sites that are a lot cheaper with the same units like VRBO, use them! Don’t book with this website!!  They are unreliable, they won’t care if you have a place to stay."
18,Robert Ryan,"May 29, 2019",3,"Problems taking photo on iPad Pro in landscape The app presents a little overlay where one can center the photo id capture, but running the app in landscape mode, the overlay was misaligned, with the overlay rectangle half off-screen. And when I disconnected it from the keyboard and rotated the device into portrait orientation, it put the overlay in the right place and everything looked rendered OK, but when I took the photo, it then grabbed the wrong portion of the photo. Bottom line, the photo capture got thoroughly confused with iPad in landscape orientation (which if you have a keyboard attached, is how we generally use these things). And when I first oriented the device into portrait, I happened to do upside-down portrait orientation (which iPads permit) and then the captured photo was upside down. Lol."
19,FoodVeggie,"July 13, 2019",1,"Horrible Customer Service!! If you can find a hotel or anything cheaper at a good price with even mild customer service, do it. Air BnB does NOT care about their customers at all!!! Dealing with Air BnB customer service has been the worst experience I have had with any business/support team. They can check the records and see that their staff AGREED with me and believed I deserved a refund for what was essentially unsafe conditions and poor communication from a host. However, after repeated attempts to receive said refund, they then claimed I had informed them too long after the reservation. They said this a week after my reservation but I had called DURING the first hour of check in for my reservation while I was AT the residence. I wish I had recorded their calls as they do yours, when dealing with customer support, and I would easily have enough evidence to show how they are misleading, careless about customer safety, and how they tell you one thing then flip to a completely different decision without the decency to call you to elaborate. They simply sent a short, rude message on the app. It is sad that they can agree with you (they can go ahead and listen to their recorded phone calls to prove it) and then message you something completely else and ignore the fact that they ever agreed with you. Ridiculous."
20,Bc2socal,"October 30, 2017",1,"Bad Customer Service Confusing app..  Great service until you run into the most minor issue.  I tried to modify a reservation and it turned into a complete nightmare of phone call after phone call with Patricia where I had to explain, reexplain and then explain again a very simple issue.  She claimed she needed to verify with the host and claimed she couldn’t reach him which was bizarre since the host said he never heard from her and was nothing but accommodating and responsive to me the entire trip.  I would recommend going directly to your host with any modifications or extensions of your trip or you’ll find yourself on the phone with Airbnb your entire trip, completely frustrated.  While she was nice she didn’t seem like she listened to a word I said. Now they continue to keep trying to take money for days I didn’t stay.  She claims she can’t reach the host but he’s a well respected doctor and we have mutual friends who are his neighbors so I’m inclined to believe his side of the story.  I would try home away vacation app instead (although I’ve never used, it but will be now). My family has properties listed on Airbnb and we will now be trying Home Away Vacation app instead as we don’t want or guests to have the same poor experience on their getaway."
21,Inn Bloom,"November 7, 2017",5,"♥️Airbnb I’ve been an Airbnb host and an Airbnb guest for over 3 1/2 years. I have hosted over 160 guests from all over the world, and all experiences have been wonderful. Not one bad experience. The places that we have stayed have been clean, friendly.... just exactly what we needed for where we were and what we’re doing. Again, as a host, I enjoy sharing my hometown with visitors and making them feel comfortable and welcome while enjoying the area. The extra money has been greatly appreciated as we live in an expensive area. Now with my husband retired, I am able to help with our expensive taxes and utilities, not to mention my health insurance which is extremely expensive since I am no longer covered by my husband’s employment. I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to contribute and be creative as a host at the same time, "
22,u may not like this but,"February 21, 2018",3,"Hard 2 c, find, use EVERYTHING. With this app is non- intuitive. Have they forgotten that “ease of use” , making text easy to read and find,  is what attracted people to the web in the first place? I drive LYFT/UBER too and I’ve taken Airbnb Programmers around S.f. Smug group generally.  Proud that they can “ force” u into certain behaviors. #AssinineArrogantBehaviors. I’ve said it before: clear bright text. Clearly organized pages and structure,  so we the users have an idea where ur going  as well as the program. Super-host” is meaningless. I’ve stayed in several “ super host” homes now, and all they did was set the bar REAL low so it is easy to hit expectations.  No difference between those folks and a hotel. "
23,yellow tail 23,"August 5, 2018",3,"Reimbursement- communication There was a guest I was hosting, they extended there stay for a extra day  after they checked in. I excepted the request and Airbnb gave the green light, I’m assuming to make sure the funds were available. That was on the Thursday they stay Friday which was the extra day and then checked out Saturday I got a email Friday morning at 1:30 in the morning saying the funds were not available. I then contacted Airbnb via email and the representative was saying if she could attempt to get the payment she tried she called then ask me if I would be willing to call the guest which I wasn’t at first then I decided that I could still reach out with a pleasant message long story short I got the payment through speaking with the guest. I asked to speak with the supervisor after messaging for four days waiting for the payment. The supervisor  called me back after the fact after I’d already retrieve the money and I feel like Airbnb wasn’t going to  reimbursed me.  I repeatedly asked the representative to reimburse me and then go collect it from the guest instead of putting me in the middle and I got nowhere I had to do it myself."
24,Asufhes,"August 13, 2018",3,"Good app except…… I enjoy all the features of this app. In fact I like all of the app with one gigantic exception… The calendar inconsistently works.  What I mean is when you open up your Airbnb app and you want to look at your calendar about 50% of the time it just hangs and will not open. All other features work but if you want to know who’s coming on what day your calendar won’t be helpful since half the time it doesn’t load. It doesn’t matter what phone you’re on it doesn’t matter if you’re on an iPad it doesn’t matter what computer… I’ve called over and over about this especially after seeing so many other people having the same issue. As a host it’s really inconvenient to not be able to see who is booking on what dates. Despite a history of this is a major issue for people, it’s still not fixed years later. So so annoying."
25,Zero stars!!!,"January 6, 2019",1,"BEWARE! Should you want a refund from a MOLD infested shack The worst experience EVER with their support team I have ever experienced. Recently rented a property in Puerto Rico of course you must pay in full, no problem excepting my money but when we arrived at the property it was nothing less than a dump not at all what the photos that were posted for the listing showed. Mold on the walls, floors, shower, smelly bedding, dirt dust missing floor tiles in the kitchen that expose the concrete below , a junkyard of a front yard, spiderwebs, clutter..... we could not even spend one night there. when I submitted the photos to THE AIR BNB they were passed on to three different individual case workers to who agreed that the place was disgusting and did not match the listing but she was not authorized so she transferred me to someone above her who never spoke to me once and ruled in favor of the host Who argued that this property was clean and nothing was wrong with it! which is completely inaccurate! In the end they are keeping our money and we did not spend one single night there this is for 14 days that they will gladly steel from their customers knowing that the place was A step above a rundown shack you may find crackheads squatting in. Airbnb might find them selves regretting to ignore the mold in the photos Porter Rico is part of America"
26,Awzum3,"April 25, 2020",1,"Unforgiving and Unhelpful! Airbnb did not refund any money for a situation that was out of my hands. I was studying abroad in Rome and planning to visit Barcelona from March 5-9, staying at an AirBnb rental. Our school mandated that we return to America on March 2nd due to the rising threat of Coronavirus, so we had no choice but to leave and could not attend our stay in Barcelona as planned. We lost all the money that we had put into this trip, even though it was not our fault. After contacting AirBnb support staff, they were not sympathetic at all towards our situation and they closed our case. We sent them all the right documentation that showed that we were forced to leave, but they did not care. Even with the credit card company involved, AirBnb still did not help us and we have not gotten any money back. We are students, so we don’t have a lot of money to begin with, and to lose that much money really is detrimental. I would have hoped that a huge corporation like AirBnb would be able to see that we are not at fault and that it’s unfair to take our money without giving some sort of refund, considering our safety was at stake. I will think twice before ever using this app and company ever again, because they definitely put their own greed before the needs of their customers."
27,D8796,"March 19, 2020",2,"App is fine. Customer is awful. Never had an issue using the app. However the company needs some work. A friend of mine created a group for us to look at cabins to rent, thus making them the ‘trip owner’, even though all they did was invite us to a group to share destinations with each other. We find one we all like, and I book it with my card. "
28,Some1withAcomputer,"July 16, 2019",2,"Push Notifications are Glitchy, amongst other things. Going on over a year now, and confirmed it with a newer phone, the PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DON’T APPEAR  half the time, if not less. (I.e the app badge, and banners). There were periods where was missing responses and threatening my response time stats because the app simply wasn’t notifying me that a message or inquiry has been received. Yes I’ve checked all the notification settings in the phone and app, and yes I’ve re-downloaded the app a handful of times. Still the app seems to spontaneously choose when to notify me of stuff. The work around is turning on texts and email as means of communication, but frustrating since now I’m forced to basically have triple versions of any given message, just to be safe I’ve mentioned this on the phone to them, but no real solutions were made obvious to me.

Their business I believe has saved my life and given me a chance to get back on my feet and be able to pay taxes again. Air is good for the US, State, local and citizen’s economy. Most of all.. my over 200 reviews tell the world that travelers like the idea of being able chose variety and unique spaces to relax at. But no competition can beat out Air’s experience providing quality app and customer service! Air is Super!!"
31,Mr. WAT112233,"December 25, 2018",1,"Choose another option I got the app, signed up, put in information to verify my account, and was locked out so they could review my information to verify. This is understandable. However, after two days and no reply, I contacted customer service and they said they could not help me and my account would be assigned to a case manager who would get back to me “shortly” to resolve my problem. Slightly irritating but still understandable. Two more days passed and I called customer service again and received the same reply, however they stated that they would get back to me within 48 hours from my original call. So now, 4 days have passed and still no reply and my case was not assigned to anyone. I waited another two days with still no response and had to find another site to book with as time was running out. NOW, OVER 3 WEEKS LATER, my vacation over with, I still have received no communication from Air B&B and my account is still locked, not even allowing me to look at the website. As, the company has grown you would thing they would expand their customer service, but apparently do not care to. Will not be using this service (as if I had a choice) in the future. There are better services out there."
32,takes too long to set up,"March 1, 2019",3,What a process to get started!!!! I got online to find a place to stay 47 minutes ago. I found a place right away and try to book it. When I got to the site where I finally do the confirmation it kept saying it wouldn’t except my card. When I got in touch with someone at Airbnb they said it was likely due to a problem with my bank. When I called the bank they explained to me that there was absolutely no charge from Airbnb and there would be no reason for them to refuse it so there’s no problem on their end. The guy at the bank told me he had issues trying to set up an account with Airbnb as well. The lady I was communicating with told me multiple times she had no idea what was going on and that they would never hold my credit card account for any reason. But when I finally downloaded the app and was able to create a profile apparently that was the hold up. In addition to that they didn’t want my credit card number and they did keep it on file. What a mess.  50 minutes later I finally have a place that would have taken 5 minutes on VBRO.
33,Long-time Fan and Follower,"August 2, 2019",1,"No longer supporting Airbnb due to discrimination I understand this is a review of the app - but would like to share my recent experience with Airbnb. A host left a review on my profile that was sexist and disgusting. Despite my entire history of perfectly treating Airbnb’s, the company refused to acknowledge the comment was sexist - conveniently, the two hosts were men and only acknowledged my partner (male), yet attacked me in the review. The Airbnb correspondent handling the case was also a man, who told me it was not discriminatory in his opinion."
34,Charlotte Dyess,"April 19, 2020",1,"Never using Airbnb or their services again With an understanding that COVID-19 has swept the nation, I understand Airbnb’s going through an influx of cancellations. That being said, the department of defense has issued a travel ban extending through June 30th. My fiancé and I had to cancel our wedding and flights to Florida and Hawaii due to this travel bad, as we are part of the military community. The venue and airlines, were understanding and provided us full compensation due to these troubling times. "
35,Horrible pop-ups,"April 11, 2020",1,"The worst customer support ever! If you’re planning on hosting you need to make sure you don’t use Airbnb! They’re the worst for helping you out. They don’t take the full amount from the guest and leave you hanging dry whenever there’s a payment issue. If they’re going to sit back and collect money from service charges, occupancy taxes, etc. they should also collect full payments from guests and release them as the dates approach. I had a issue with a guest staying 2 months and not paying anything the 2nd month. When I asked Airbnb about non payment they said they tried to collect and there was an issue with that. The guest ended up leaving in the middle of the night, stole numerous things, and didn’t pay. When I reached out to Airbnb they said they’d look into it. I had to do a reverse number search and come to find out this guest that was staying was defrauding people. AIRBNB Does a terrible job of actually filtering who’s using their platform. This lady has been convicted of nurse impersonation and battery and assault. Only reason I was able to find her actual last name was because I did my research. Stay away from Airbnb! They’re not there to help you at all. They haven’t even responded to me. It’s been a week!"
36,P. alexis,"January 17, 2020",5,Great customer service I had a potentially horrible stay at a host location. It smelled terribly of cat urine and feces as soon as the door opened. I set foot inside and realized the the bedroom light didn’t work and it was pitch black besides the flashlight on my phone. The front door wouldn’t close correctly unless you turned the deadbolt. Just ridiculous and smelly. Immediately called Airbnb for a refund and they responded amazingly. I provided pictures and video of the place and got a full refund and the host’s privileges were revoked. They also set me up with hotel accommodations for the night as it was late and no other Airbnb’s were available until the next morning. I spoke with the same person every single time which made customer service amazing because i didn’t have to retell my story and explain myself to a new person. The CS manager called me and emailed me within a very timely manner. It was all resolved in about 2 hours! I’m very happy with the service and will continue to use Airbnb.
37,tstecker,"June 10, 2019",1,"Support is thin at best, and hosts do whatever they want. The Air BB support is limited. I made a somewhat last minute reservation (1 week in advance) I was asked to pay additional money for tax direct to the host ($200+) None of the payment methods worked and no one answered the phone. Uncomfortable with the reservation I moved to cancel it. I was informed I would only receive $250 or the $1900 payment. Even though a booked it 24 hours earlier. I called Air BB support. Was put on hold for several minutes then told they would call me back. After 4 hours I sent a message which was answered shortly afterwards informing me that I would receive a call soon. 4 days later I called again. I was told that the payment request needs to go through Air BB platform and that the reservation could not be cancelled. Now stuck with a reservation I’m not happy with, I’m being forced to pay and move forward or forfeit $1700. I’ve had good experiences using this service but the last two bookings were not good. USE AT YOUR OWN RUSK! If the host is shady, Air BB cannot and will not help you resolve it to your satisfaction. Only the satisfaction of the faceless host. In this case a vacation company. Who never gave me a point of contact that actually worked."
38,HoneyBeee000333,"November 8, 2019",1,DO NOT BOOK WITH AIR BNB I booked a stay with air Bnb through a Guy named Vic in Decatur GA And was scammed out of my money. After booking a room for a week and the Host ACCEPTED my request AND payment; I contacted the host to receive instructions on how to enter the home and the host tells me the room is NOT available. The host then lies to the representative and tells them he said no such thing. The Representatives all (3) that I have spoken with all had NASTY attitudes and could not accommodate me for the POOR excuses and services that AIR BNB provides. Now I’m stuck outside in the cold with my children due to the negligence and poor services that this company provides. This is not the first time that this situation has occurred through Air BNB.I blame Air BNB for allowing people like Vic to continue to provide services and I Blame Air BNB For not allowing their customers whom spend their hard earned money to feel as though We are respected. They treated me like Trash and I would really hate to see someone else end up in a situation as such. So before booking with this company please weigh your options. They will give you a complete run around and there would be nothing you can do. It’s 30 degrees outside and now my only option is to wait on God. God bless America

All I hear are great things about these beautiful home, and everyone’s quick to look into Airbnb. I booked two different homes for my husband and I. My payment wasn’t denied when originally booking these places. BUT to complete my payment (pay the other half of my booking) my card is continuously declined. This is only after the host told me to cancel my entire trip I order to add ONE date. I’ve lost money, time. Airbnb is no help whatsoever and told me to just “keep trying” to make this payment. No one has apologized. No courtesy. Nothing. And my host continues to threaten to cancel my trip because my “payment isn’t being made”. If I cancel now I’ll lose 200+$$ never again. Hotels for now on. Update:: the second location we had booked for 6 days from now was just canceled by the host. No Airbnb’s in our price range are available anymore. And for a group of five a hotel is going to be double. Airbnb is a disaster. Ruined our entire trip, and literally profited off of it. Wouldn’t recommend anyone using this app, website or company until they make some serious changes to their policies and customer service."

My friends and I have been planning to book this specific room, and when we finally saved up, I tried to book it. My account was all set up, and when I booked it, it kept on giving me a “failed verification.” I sent a clear picture of my state ID and a clear picture of myself to have that verification cleared up. So I tried many times to book it, but it just wouldn’t go through. An hour later, I got an email saying that they couldn’t tell if I was the person on MY OWN ID. So I tried to get this cleared up asap and sent another verification. It takes them hours to verify. The beach house my friends and I have been saving up for is now booked by someone else, only because of this horrible app and how slow their process takes. I tried to keep in touch with the host of the house, but the host could not help me with this problem. It is impossible to contact the customer service, because it is not on their site. They expect you to get ALL of your answers from the Help Center, even though it DOES NOT provide everything. This leaves us no choice but to pay a grand for expensive hotel here in Hawaii.

45,Cougarwhiskers,"August 12, 2018",5,"Honest review Initially, Airbnb had many problems. Among them was poor customer service support. Recently, through their Twitter account, I receive nearly immediate responses to my Owner questions and problems. Yay! Their Service fees to guest have been higher than other sites like VRBO, however from an owner standpoint, they are currently not charging a 3% transaction fee on credit card and e checks that VRBO is charging, which significantly reduces owner profitability. They also do not have a screwy algorithm like VRBO that can significantly reduce visibility and page views. My only suggestion at this point to AirBNB is to include local and state taxes in the calculations for guest stays. These are now frequently required nearly everywhere and create confusion for guests in either having to post higher rental rates to include the taxes, or a surprise after renting that taxes are due by the guest. I have sincerely enjoyed working with AirBNB and have found the guests who have stayed to be informed, responsible and communicative."

49,app enthusiast 1,"July 28, 2019",1,"Terrible for hosts Airbnb as a publicly traded company is not mature with regards to its hosting functionality and support.  There have been multiple instances where I have been woefully unsupported as a host.  For instance, when a user made a stay extension request hours before scheduled check-out, with a declined credit card...airbnb granted the extension and requested that the host sort out the payment issue with the user...then airbnb charged the host $100 for “host canceling” the reservation that technically already ended, stating that they don’t have the functionality to cancel an extension specifically.  Or when my listing required an additional person charge, which a user lied to get around, not considering that the host checks guests in personally, and often hosts can count. In this instance, airbnb again said there’s nothing they can do, and that the host had to pursue the discrepancy with the user directly. And at the tail end of it, when the user writes an angry review that obviously impacts future profitability, airbnb refused to take it down..  If other hosts have had similar experiences and have suffered losses due to airbnb’s inept management and lack of accountability, there may be remedies to pursue collectively!"
50,Spazzfx,"October 3, 2017",4,"Great service, not so great app Air bnb has been extremely helpful for us over the past few months. We have an extra room in our house and we rent it out through Air bnb which has been very successful and making us some much needed extra money in tight times. It was also very helpful while we were traveling overseas. It saved us a large amount of money booking rooms not in an expensive hotel. There are some risks using the service since you never know what kind of person you are booking from and the space where you will be staying isn’t always as nice as it’s presented in the listing. "
51,Silverlake dteaming,"May 27, 2018",5,"A++ customer service Airbnb is a leader in today’s emerging app based economy. Not only do they provide fun, safe, and interesting places to stay, but their customer service is unparalleled. You can be sure that they will consider each case personally, and individually. The majority of my rentals have gone very smoothly, but every once in a while there is a hitch. Each time I’ve encountered a problem I’ve had an Airbnb employee contact me personally, make sure they understand the full situation on both sides, and come to a resolution in which all parties feel satisfied, and supported. Their customer support employees are obviously given the responsibility to make their own decisions based on individual facts, opposed to older, outdated models of customer services where employees are trained to respond with blanket statements, or form emails. Hopefully, other companies will follow Airbnb’s lead, and start to offer services customers can trust, and feel loyal to again."

54,uwishuknew1972,"February 17, 2020",1,"Not my favorite thing I was always hesitant to use this app because of all the extra fees hosts would impose. Booking fees, cleaning fees, etc. More than 1 location has extra fees themselves out of my business. I’m used to staying in hotels where CLEANING is included with the rate and it’s just been simpler and cheaper to book a hotel room. However, when I started doing more international travel and interested in experiencing these countries similar to what the locals experience, I’ve tried booking through the Airbnb app. My main criticism at this point is how quickly they take funds versus how slowly they release refunds. And the issue is not with my bank. Airbnb is holding my money. Nevermind that, by them doing this, might prevent someone from booking another place. Just ridiculous for them to keep funds for so long. I can’t recommend them or this app to anyone. Stick with hotels. I’ve had to cancel hotel reservations before and didn’t lose anything. Funds not even taken until the day of check-in. I booked the Airbnb a month before scheduled check-in and cancelled immediately. Almost 3 weeks later and I’m still waiting for my refunded money. A whole mess."
55,mixedmedia65,"November 19, 2019",3,"Changing my rating I’ve used airbnb very happily for more than a year as i’ve travelled around the US working as an RN, but i recently had a really bad experience with a host and airbnb gave me the runaround for two weeks before closing my case without even really talking to me. If they had been upfront and told me that i wasn’t going to get my $1000 back instead of leading me on about a mediation that was supposed to happen, i wouldn’t have been happy but at least i wouldn’t have felt lied to. Last time i talked to them a few days ago  i was told that another case manager would call me. Needless to say that didn’t happen. I use airbnb for the good people out there offering up their homes and there are still plenty of them out there. Be careful when you’re setting up long term rentals because it’s very easy to lose large amounts of money without anyone at airbnb blinking an eye about it. In fact, they seem to employ a lot of people who will say whatever they need to say in order to get you off the phone. Good service, poor customer support."

When we got there and were ready to check in, the host decided to let us know that the bathroom hasn’t been working and they weren’t home to fix it. We called Airbnb and they gave us a refund, and began to help us find another bnb in the area. 4 hrs later we have nowhere to go, a car full of our belongings and the person responsible for “helping us” left for the day without even letting us know she was leaving or providing an additional place to stay. Now 3 days later the host hasn’t been flagged and is still allowed to rent out their space with no bathroom, and the people working for Airbnb are acting all of this time wasted and inconvenience isn’t their problem. Luckily we were only a state away from our home and could figure it out, but we’ve used this company multiple times out of the country, and the thought of this happening in a setting like that and their staff talking down to us like us being inconvenienced is a burden on them is why I will never use them again"

The cancellation policy is not even close to being as good as vrbo’s cancellation policy, and I don’t think that the cancellation policy that is in place due to corona virus is fair at all. (Airbnb gives 50% MINUS the service fee, after you cancel 48 hours from booking) they have changed their policy to offer 100% refunds for reservations made before March 14th, and for the bookings that are before mid-April. It is not certain that the pandemic will be continue after mid-April and it will most likely be continuing in the summer. With that being said, those families who will have no choice but to go out of town to their reservations in the summer to avoid losing their money will be put in danger of the virus by this very company. I wish I had booked through Vrbo, who has an extremely flexible cancellation policy and lower prices. (They give a full refund of the booking if you cancel by a closer date before the reservation, and their prices are lower for the SAME quality of places to stay) I will not be recommending this app to anyone traveling and I will never be using this service again for my future travels. 🤠"

I asked him nicely and he started insulting me and being rude and unprofessional! I reached out to air bnb customer service and they agreed it was absurd but they told me I needed to deal with the host myself.. I ask him to return all my money and he declined, I spoke to another rep and she said she would call the host to find an agreement and said she would call back in 10-15 mins and never called me back.  For my first time using this app it’s been nothing but a headache and has given me so much stress.. so now I’m out $180 that they won’t refund for a misleading listing and a host that is disrespectful keeps my money.

Airbnb refunded the money from the bed bug infested house that they certified after 6 weeks. They never offered to cover any other expenses.  I decided to try them one more time.  After the third time, I rented a house that offered WiFi and TV. These are basic amenities for any house. The WiFi never worked and the TVs were Internet TVs so none of the televisions worked.  I had brought this to the attention of the host 12 hours before.  She would not do anything about so I complained to Airbnb.  Their solution was for me to leave the last night around 10 PM.

They refused my request even the host him self ignored it. I made contact with the team and they cared less for my issue instead they helped the host to take the money. I never got refund and I will never use this app again.

I will continue to tell my friends and family what kind of poor service we have been provided and will cancel every account I have with this disgraceful company. We drove 10 hours, had 4 people flying in from all across the country and have not been helped whatsoever. We have been given fake coupon codes, hung up on, assigned 4 different “case managers”, and told that we will not be reimbursed any money but rather charged more for last minute booking on a new place. While I understand things happen, the fact that such a large and well known company doesn’t have the ability nor the want to help their guests when THEY put us out last second is baffling and unacceptable. I will never be using Airbnb again, and I highly recommend anyone else considering them to think twice before they do, too."
69,lacey304vegas,"October 18, 2019",1,"Discrimination experience I loved Airbnb until they showed us their true colors and banned my husband and I because HE has a criminal record from 15+ years ago.. MY record is sparkly clean but since he is traveling with me they banned my account to. After thousands of dollars we have spent staying across the country using Airbnb.. we couldn’t believe how they treated us. MAYBE the background checks should be done prior to letting guests stay in peoples homes.. We are on a 7 week long road trip and are now forced to stay in hotels because we travel with our dog. This experience with Airbnb is ridiculous, and I will from now on advise everyone who uses this app to STOP spending their money on such a rude company. Banning guests without a warning by email, or phone call. Airbnb should have more consideration for others, and they should have a proper customer service phone number with representatives that actually can give you a straight answer and solve your problem the first time without giving you a runaround. One VERY unhappy customer with good lawyers is all it takes for a booming company like this to be.. haha"
70,101Micheal,"June 26, 2018",3,"Lost lists Overall, I absolutely love the app, it's easy to find homes almost anywhere. My main concern is the fact that most of my lists of homes have gotten erased. I spent an extensive amount of time saving homes in many, many different areas, when I went to check back on the lists, I realized most of them had been erased...which means that I'd have to take the time to restart all of them, which would end up pointless, because other lists would end up getting erased. I'll take a guess that there is a limit of lists on the app, which I must say is bs and I would recommend you guys allow people to make as many lists as they want. I have also noticed that the search engine doesn't provide a list of related areas anymore, if you are to type in a city or place. This causes issue because now you have to weirdly specify what exact area you are talking about. These are the only two main problems I see with the app, I would like to see these problems fixed."

I’ve been using them for years and did not have a problem until we recently checked into our Airbnb in Maui Hawaii. The place was riddled with bugs! They’re called coconut condos, do not stay there! Anyway, we had to cancel on the spot and Airbnb refused to refund my money. We couldn’t stay there, there were ants everywhere, I have video, but Airbnb didn’t want to see that. Then they closed my complaint ticket before we even returned from our vacation!! The told me in a message that the refund policy stated that there would be no refunds. This is all on top of us having to find a hotel to stay in the last minute. Then, THEN, after contacting AirBnB and telling them about the problem - THEY DELETED MY ENTIRE TRIP FROM MY PROFILE - which makes it impossible for me to go back and leave a review of the place we had to cancel because it was infested with bugs!!! I couldn’t even get arm others!!! AirBnB only likes great reviews I guess, but if you have a bad experience it’s “F*** you, no refund and you can’t share your experience.” Stick with VRBO."

73,emma13975,"September 9, 2018",1,"Bad Customer Service, Only Avoids Responsibility Reputation of a company is earned in crisis management.  Been a super host for a long time, and recently had a guest who left early and had reservation shortened.  We agreed with case manager to refund guest the rest of days the guest did not stay, yet somehow the case manager later cancelled the entire reservation and refunded the guest fully.  Now I’m left with no pay out for hosting this guest for days.  I’ve been contacting Airbnb customer service for quite a while, and the only response I got is that the case is being handled and they will reach out to me.  However, I never hear back from Airbnb within the time frames they promised.  I could never get in touch with the case manager who is working on this issue, and every time I called, representative on the call didn’t know what was happening.  I could only assume Airbnb does not want to pay host for hosting after Airbnb has mistakenly refunded guest in full.  If this is the way Airbnb chooses to treat hosts, I could only suggest other hosts to have a plan B, because once you run into a problem with any guest or with Airbnb, you are in it on your own."
74,Diahnn,"September 13, 2018",4,"Pros and Cons I love the business we’ve gotten from Airbnb and the personal links we can put on our listing to make sure our guests can’t book unless they meet certain requirements. I don’t like the fee Airbnb charges both our guests and us. They have taken more than $600 from individual renters over the summer. When I called to make sure that was right, I was told the percentage they take varies from 6-15% depending on the place and time of year. It seems only fair that the percent be the same across the board. "
75,rrrripppedoff,"January 14, 2019",1,"Allows people to steal your money. I booked on a Saturday night for a week in Asheville. I got normal acceptance and thought I was done. Oh no, I get communication from the host that now I must go through their approval process. Very long drawn out list of rules and some where I was supposed to send them lots of personal info. They have already said I had the room and they have my money. I was confused because I am a senior and was trying to do this on my phone and was tired. I have never been asked anything like this before. I just asked them if I had the room or not and told them I did not not understand what they wanted. I told them I wanted to cancel and they said I still had a legal obligation to pay them even though they had never once said that I was “approved"" for the room. I complained to Airbnb and was told they would investigate. Nothing from them but the host has since messaged me and accused me of being drunk, insulted and berated me all because I said I would not sign their additional paper work agreeing to all kinds of stuff I have never been asked before. I think this is fraud and misrepresentation."
76,Fitty Cents,"May 19, 2019",1,"Shady and worst customer services Apparently allows the host to cancel the reservations last minute that can cause or mess up your vacation plan. Top of that customer services come up with complimentary coupons of $10-15 what a freaking waste of your money, time and more importantly your vacation precious times for which you have paid so much more than Airbnb reservation fees truly the worst customer services. I told them to keep $13 that was offered to me cause host cancelled my reservations at 6:30 pm when my check in time was 3:00 pm. I was told by customer services that this perfectly okay for host to do and they will give me $13 to make up for it. I had a toddler and my wife traveling with me I had to just cancel all my plans for the day and find another place at 7:00 pm so we can at least have a place  to sleep and pay premium fees for the last minute booking. Way to make money AirBnb your business and corporate policies will be shared with in my friends and family circle along with on social media. Hope you made money and also I know you guys don’t care much about your customers much."
77,Marylupe89,"May 30, 2019",1,Bad service We rented a house in flagstaff the host name is Robert. It’s called house robert unique hilltop home. Our experience was terrible because once we arrived it was weird that the house had no curtains up till the third floor. When we entered the place there was a nasty odor. Another thing the host wasn’t honest about his post he didn’t mention that there was also another house in front and the back. With the house having no curtains there’s no privacy was so ever and if there was other people they would have seen everything. From the bad odor there was we decide to leave and we decided to call Airbnb the manager who attended us was Juan and he couldn’t help us because the host said there was no bad odor and we weren’t able to get a refund. We would have to have proof of the bad odor to be able to get a refund. It didn’t matter if we didn’t get a refund we able to post about our bad experience and it wasn’t fair that there was no honesty what so ever. We never had any bad experience with Airbnb this time it sucked that weren’t able to get the help that we needed which was a disappointment as a guest.

Then you start noticing in your trending neighborhood entire duplexes and apartments having a different guest every night. Then your cool little low key spot starts to have developers come in a remodel homes specifically for Airbnb homes but online the adds claim these developers lived in our hood for years and love the bodega on the corner. I don’t know who you Karen, I’ve never seen your high class here before. Then you try one of these new remodeled homes to put your parents up since you live in a barely affordable 600 sq ft home with spouse and two kids. When you help Gigi get her luggage into the 400$ a night swanky modern bungalow you notice an ant infestation. You call the SUPER host who doesn’t return call. You call Airbnb who tells you to contact host. Gigi goes to a hotel because of the ants infestation and Airbnb refuses to refund and the host blatantly lies. I live across the street Karen I saw you didn’t clean or check anything. I will not use them ever again. They’re ruining neighborhoods and lowering the standards of hospitality."
79,xxinfinity,"January 25, 2020",1,Doesn’t care about sexual assault I was the victim of sexual assault at an Airbnb location and was unfortunately more traumatized by AirBnB and law enforcement. I was put on extensive holds by Airbnb when I tried to report it even after I told them what happened. More than 15 minutes. And no one got back to me. I think they were just trying to get rid of me. When I emailed them after cancelling the reservation they sent me a very adversarial email demanding a police report and basically saying I was a liar. I actually went to the police and they didn’t want to deal with it and it was more traumatic because they didn’t think I’d drive back for the prosecution since I was from out of town and so they didn’t want to do any work on a Sunday when no one was at the office in this small town. I will never stay at an Airbnb alone and with a host again. And beware Airbnb doesn’t care about victims. FYI you can’t get a police report immediately after an incident and even so you just got a number for the report not the full report. They were obviously just trying to revictimize me with this ridiculous request.
80,Youthspent,"January 13, 2018",1,"The service fees and service are bad I overpaid for an outdated home. I accepted that. Instead of moving my stuff at the end of the reservation I extended it for 3 days. For some reason it did not save. I discovered this right after the original check out. I called the homeowner who said call air bnb. It has been an hour and a half. After the first 30 minutes I was told that I would need to speak to a case manager, she transferred me and I held for 20 more minutes. I was then transferred back to the original rep who said all the case managers were busy I asked to speak to a supervisor, and expressed my frustration at paying $170 for a service fee and when I call not being able to speak to someone who can help with my problems. I was told I was being put on hold and transferred to no sound just me on hold for over ten minutes. I hung up called back waited explained what had happened asked to speak to a supervisor and then I was told the original rep I had spoke to was about to call me back and I should end the call and keep the line open. I've typed this in the twenty minutes since then."
81,Meg2018!!!!!!!!!!!,"June 19, 2018",1,"Terrible Company I will never use Airbnb again. I had one bad experience and it was enough to throw me off them for good. When making a reservation you are supposed to receive the hosts actual address but I only received the protected address that gives you an idea of where they live but not the location. Turns out my host was out of the country and her 18 year old son was supposed to let me in. Well when I arrived in the vicinity of her neighborhood I spent over an hour walking around, calling, and messaging her with no response, no idea where to go, and no way to contact her son. I finally had to book a hotel room. At midnight that night I got a message back from her and was able to stay at her place the next night. I would have just cancelled if she didn’t have such a strict cancellation policy. It’s been over a week since I made a case with Airbnb and the host only gave me half my money back for the first night and I haven’t heard a thing from Airbnb’s customer service. So disappointed. I have seen so many complaints about hosts doing what they want with no repercussions."
82,bbdow30,"August 30, 2018",4,"Convenient but inconsistent Love how easy the app is to use, but the inconsistencies are frustrating. Hosts can enforce their own policies, but the app has its own that are misleading. For example, at what age does a child become an adult? Each host may advertise what they define as “children are free”, but the app asks for adults and children based on a child being from 2-12 years old. Also, our most recent host doesn’t charge the credit card immediately, but the app says 50% due up front. I didn’t know until I was committed to the reservation whether I was paying now or later. Some things may be minor to some people but deal breakers to others. I’m a huge fan of truth in advertising. Would like to see these details (including advertising ALL the HIDDEN FEES) up front so I can compare properties effectively up front and make a rational decision, rather than starting my relaxing vacation feeling frustrated or hoodwinked."

The host, Anais, wasn’t willing to cancel the reservation or refund me. I had called within 15 mins of my error, trying to explain that I made a dumb mistake because I was tired from the long drive. But the true hero here was James, the AirBnB customer service staff. He personally took care of the issue and was so very kind over the phone. I’m so very grateful, and people like James are the reason why I keep coming back to AirBnB. James, if you’re reading this, I promise I’m writing this review parked at a gas station!

87,hcoffeyy,"June 27, 2019",1,"They will disable your account I really loved Airbnb my first couple times using it and depended on it for trips. Out of the blue they disabled my account and could not tell me why. Their customer support team treated me with little respect and before I could get ahold of someone I was hung up on 4 different times. When I finally reached someone they told me there was nothing that could be done. A day later I receive an email from someone reviewing my case telling me they are not obligated to tell me why they disabled my account and I won’t be able to get it back. The only thing I can figure is I logged onto my account through a friends phone. If that is the case that’s very disappointing. Not to mention, over the phone, they made me repeat my personal information multiple times while telling me I’m being recorded. I felt like I was dealing with the cops or something, so strange. Anyways Airbnb is a complete disappointment and even worse, it’s happened to a lot of people. The fact they won’t even give you an answer as to why makes you feel even worse."

I cannot imagine a finer experience than to stroll Notting Hill with my guide Silvio.  Another couple cancelled, so I had Silvio as a private guide. He is warm, funny, and extremely knowledgeable about the area, both it’s history and it’s current hidden gems.  It lasted 3.5 hours and it was so much fun it felt like 10 minutes.  If you like walking, learning about the non-touristy sites of the area and music I highly recommend this tour.  As an added bonus, Silvio had a playlist with him of all different types of music, all of which had lyrics or cinematic connections to Notting Hill or Portobello Road in common.  And, as promised, Silvio sent me a copy of the playlist, pictures of what we saw, and trailers from films, the following day.  He is prepared, thorough and a very nice guy.  Highly recommended!"

As a first time user of Airbnb, I was a little nervous until I found out I could practically rent out someone’s apartment. I had thought I had to share it with someone which I didn’t like the idea of. Being an introvert, this option was perfect. I accidentally booked an apartment that I had to share with the host and I quickly canceled. Sadly, the host didn’t return the money. After contacting customer service, they swiftly returned the money out of their own pockets because they saw I was a new user and wanted my first experience with them to be amazing. I was ecstatic to say the least. After the initial mess up on my part, I found a great apartment for a great price in LA. Loved my stay in a clean apartment that was hosted my a professional host. Will definitely use and recommend to people again."

I meet many wonderful people from all countries, all cultures, all backgrounds and listen to their stories with an open mind and with pure love of humanity. I have learned so much About other countries and other cultures without having to leave my home. As far as Airbnb as a company, I cannot give them enough props. The very few times I have had an issue they have handled it over the phone courteously and efficiently They have an excellent Phone app which is so easy to use     Their program and pay routine was well thought out. I cannot ever see myself not doing Airbnb. I am retired and this is perfect for me. Yes, it’s work involved changing sheets and cleaning bathrooms but the payoff is immeasurable."

It was secluded, quite and absolutely beautiful. The bed was so comfortable I didn’t want to get up and run around San Diego. FYI - a lot of times I just stayed in the room ;) The amenities Ty offers are better then any hotel stay. Meaning: full common area usage that has everything a home would have and then some. Plus your room is equipped with a smartTv, streaming apps and more. Ty has even made sure each bathroom has little toiletries for her guest. Ty’s is now locked in as my preferred San Diego Airbnb. Ty was also very helpful with information about San Diego, recommendations to fix my personality and very responsive to my questions and concerns. I could go on and on.

94,TimIsenman,"January 11, 2019",2,"App has had no change in years, including bugs. This app is so poorly made, it drives me nuts. If there were a strong alternative to Airbnb, I’d use it immediately. Directions almost never work. Linking to a map application fails every single time. Navigation is poor, as is the photo viewing in different types of views. In some, you can click to view a whole photo, in others you can’t, and those times are usually when you especially want to see an image. Some data is also not saved on the app, so you need access to the internet to see things like conversations with a host. Really critical stuff when you’re traveling abroad with often no internet. This app is the definition of “death by a thousand paper cuts.” I’m only writing this in hopes the dev team will see it and review their priorities. I honestly have not seen a change to this app in three years, which makes me believe they are rebuilding the entire thing. I just reluctantly use the app anyway, because the alternatives are sparse."

We booked 2 months in advance and they cancelled out reservation 2 weeks before our flights left! Then when I went to rebook another place it was $200 more because they didn’t give us enough notice. They then didn’t get back to me about our issue until 3 days before our flight. This was the worst experience I have ever had and I will NEVER use them again. Do not use them if you have flights to leave somewhere. It’s too risky. Not only that the place I booked I booked directly with them after and save $400!!!! Airbnb is a joke. Use VRBO! Same thing but better. I’m surprised Airbnb is still in business the way they handle your vacations and make you wait last minute to panic. They also have 3 different teams and you can ONLY talk to customer service which can do NOTHING for you. You have to wait for an email from one of the other teams which do not get back to you until over a week later. I wish I could give this zero stars. It deserves negative stars.

She also told us about the history of the discovery of the buried ruin of Pompeii, the history of various attempts to excavate it, and so on and so forth.
