0,dcmsanto,"April 4, 2020",1,"Crappy CUSTOMER SERVICE! Crappy is an understatement! Air BNB is horrendous. Yes, I understand the influx of customers wanting refunds due to the Coronavirus pandemic. However, all of these customer’s should receive their money back. The option of travel credit is also not what I want. They are making it so difficult to get my money back in return because I haven’t given “proper documentation.” That is completely ludicrous! I have sent them documentations of my working in the hospital and my employer stating travel restrictions due to risk of contaminating patients with the virus. I’ve also sent them documentation of my flight being cancelled. My flight and other activities did really well in customer service and being able to return my money in full. But AIRBNB has been so difficult to work with. They have no common sense at all! They are still giving me a difficult time with getting my refund of my money to my card. They instead want to trick you into getting a travel credit for future reservations. Due to their lack of customer service, I told them I don’t intend to make future arrangements with AIRBNB. But they are dragging this on to the point where it’s close to my reservation date. All I want is my money back. I also fall under the extenuating circumstances category, yet still they have been so difficult to work with. And I don’t know what to do. They are really just off to steal my money."
1,Sam Battle,"August 31, 2019",1,The worst service ever!!! Hotels are way better! First off it takes forever for Airbnb support to get back in touch with you. I dealt with a place INFESTED WITH SPIDERS! And it took DAYS to deal with customer service for a solution. They then wanted proof and I sent a pic of one spider and they said it was NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE! Then I sent 4 pics of 4 different spiders and THEH CLOSED MY CASE WITHOUT A RESOLUTION! A hotel would NEVER make a guest prove an infestation to change rooms!!!!! And they wanted me to talk to the host about it like I want to confront someone about their spider infestation in Their home! Thats not my place! I paid hundreds of dollars to be comfortable!
2,$@h67,"December 24, 2019",1,"DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!! I had the worst experience ever! Every year my family makes plans to go out of town to celebrate Christmas, this year we decided Orlando, FL. I heard about AirBnb and decided to check it out. I reserved a house for December 27-January 2 and reserved it on August. I get a text a week before the trip saying the host canceled the reservation. The host didn’t let me know the reason and just canceled. I try contacting the host and he didn’t respond to my calls and text. I call customer service and they tell me it was an emergency and that my money is going to be refunded in 5 to 10 business days. They didn’t give me an explanation at all. I decided to get another house that was $1000 more, but I was ok with it since I had everything paid for and family from another country was coming. 2 days before the trip I get a cancellation message again about my reservation on the new place. This host was decent enough to tell me that he canceled due to the days I reserved for were already booked. Apparently Airbnb showed available rooms that were not really available. Called customer service and they didn’t give me any solutions, just sent me listings of places that were already not available or $5000 more in price. Give me a $200 coupon like that was any help at all. I’m never using this app again and I recommend you do the same."
3,Hoodoo2,"January 14, 2019",1,"Ridiculous So I signed up and attempted to book for the first time about a year later. In the mean time I had canceled the credit card I signed up with. So I attempted to book but it failed because of the credit card. I got an email, a text and a message through the app telling me it failed. I clicked the link in the email which opened the app but there was no indication of how or where to update the credit card. I finally found it, not in account settings, but (strangely) on the page of the failed booking. There was no option to remove a payment method nor to update a credit card. However there was a button to add a new payment method except the feature would not load. I just got the white page and the little animated dots. I tried restarting the app, restarting the phone, updating the app, and tried it on WiFi and cellular all over the course of about 12 hours. Nothing worked. So I logged into the website. There I found an option to delete a payment method but incredibly there was no option I could find to add a payment method. So I contacted customer service. The replied to my message at 4AM the next day but gave me no helpful information. I replied, but didn’t hear back from them for three more days. By then I had already booked with a normal hotel which, of course, was no problem. Good riddance Airbnb."
4,Dustpal,"March 5, 2018",1,"Why yes, I would like to stay 30 minutes away from my destination Something is wrong with the search engine airbnb uses. I put in a City and great, there's like 800 places to pick from. Problem is that most of these locations are 30 minutes away from where I actually want to be. As a traveler, this is mostly inconvenient. So then you have to waste your time checking through each posting to see which one is actually close to where you want to be. Please add a distance filter from the city center to fix this mess. Other room finding applications know how to manage distance, so airbnb is way behind."
5,Ashley K05,"August 13, 2019",1,"Don’t stay with AirBnB I am very disappointed with Airbnb. We had an ant problem in our house, and when I tried to resolve it with the host, she turned on me and blamed us. She said she went above and beyond and that is just not true. Since we didn't think to ""document"" the ants, Airbnb took the hosts' side of the conversation. That is so wrong and has made me never want to use Airbnb again. While the host insulted me as a person and said I was too demanding and minimized what actually happened, Airbnb was no better. They said they had to side with her because I had no pictures. I am sorry but who thinks to take a photo when your hand is covered in ants, and you are just trying to make sure they aren't all over everything you own, which for the record they were. They were in the bed, on my retainer, glasses, clothing, etc. It was one of the most disgusting things I have had to clean. Yes, that's right, we had to clean it because the owner didn't believe in taking a more drastic measure to clean then Windex. Airbnb's customer service was no good either. They made it seem like they empathized with me when they called to hear more information and that they were so sorry, yet they did nothing to rectify the situation. I will never stay with them again. Beware, if anything happens - DOCUMENT IT ALL, otherwise your words mean nothing."
6,Leaux3,"November 14, 2019",1,"Worst customer service ever Let me start by setting the scene.... I am 4 months pregnant and I have a 4 year old son. My fiancé’s bday was the other day and he had to travel to Miami for a work trip so we made a family weekend out of it. The hotel we were staying at was over booked so we decided to try to use Air B and B to find something cheaper that was still local. Downloaded the app, set up a profile and picked a place. Confirmed it and were excited out our new reservation. Not even 15 minutes later we get a message saying our reservation was canceled. Called the hotel and they said the never received the payment so we need to contact air B and B. I contacted them and the lady “couldn’t give me any info” so we waited for a “case manager” to call back. A couple hours later a women who spoke extremely broken English called and said they were sorry they have to cancel the reservation but we broke the terms and agreements.... which I don’t know how when we literally set up the profile properly and verified everything! And booked a place AND THEY TOOK THE NEARLY $200 OUT OF OUR ACCOUNT!!!!!!! They would NOT give us a further explanation at all and the lady would not work with us at all and HUNG UP ON ME! Needless to say they put us in an extremely tight bind and we will never use this app ever again. Beware! Seems pretty scamish."
7,sea225,"June 15, 2018",4,"So far it’s been good, but needs a little work! So far it’s been good, but still has some work to be done On the app ect. sometimes the app crashes or takes a while to update. I get messages way later like a day or 2 later on guests asking me questions. I did notice that it has not been sending the check In information to the guests so they get trapped out side the gate for a while because the messages don’t come in to my phone right when they message. Also I’ve been getting guests having a hard time keeping the booking I get them confirmed and then a day later it’s canceled on them. Guest call me a lot trying to figure out how to book. Maybe make the booking a little easier. Also if you are in a state that they pay the tax for you make sure to look in to it cause they only pay the state tax not the city tax. Wish they could pay that also each quarter for me. I give Airbnb over all a 4 cause it’s good just not yet a 5 yet. Work on app a little more and maybe put a system in that is like doc u sign. that way it just automatically sends the booking waver that we need each guest to sign so I don’t have to do it manually."
8,es-py,"December 25, 2018",1,"Do Not Do Business With This Company My family and I are stranded in an unfamiliar state thanks to Airbnb and their unwillingness to correct their mistakes. Thank you for allowing us to book a condo under construction. Thank for allowing us to find this out after thousands of dollars of airfare, time off and hours driving to the booking. Thank you for failing to send any emails or messages informing us of this issue. Thank you for acknowledging the mistake and shooting down any attempt to accommodate my family by booking us a similar listing even though similar listings were available on your app and website. We were forced to deal with horrible customer service representatives. If anyone at the company is reading this please invest in some workshops/training idk maybe a Christmas bonus or something because dealing with your representatives took this experience to another level of frustration. I would not be sitting here writing this essay if it wasn’t for the young lady I had the pleasure of speaking to last night. Thank you for this experience Airbnb! Who would have thought opening Christmas gifts in rental cars would be so fun! And thanks for the great advice of finding a hotel to accommodate 6 adults on Christmas Eve for 8 days in Orlando. The amount of options were plentiful!!! Thank you! Merry Christmas from our Ford Explorers."
9,ehowle,"August 30, 2018",2,"Cancellation by host Was recently cancelled on for one of our trips. There was absolutely no recourse. I went to your q&a and found out you have a pretty strict set of rules for canceling on the host, but no real strict set of rules on hosts cancelling on guests. This is absolutely horrible. The host only loses the cancellation. The guests lose all that they had invested in the trip - airfare, other places to stay, any reservations and down payments on things like prearranged things or trips such as boating, kayaking, entry fees, etc.  Also I could not leave an Airbnb review on the host. This is absolutely uncalled for. Both the host and Airbnb need to know the consequences of this action. And others need to know that the host cancels on guests.  Airbnb really needs to rethink this policy. If a host cancel, they should be responsible for any costs that the guests incurred. I have heard that hosts will cancel if they get a higher rental fee. Don’t know if that happened to me, but that should absolutely be forbidden and if one cancellation occurs, the host should be moved to the lowest ranking. They must be discouraged from doing any cancellation.  They have to be running this like a business. The excuse I got was the host had to leave town and could not find someone to clean it before the last guest before me. Really poor excuse!!"
10,guesswho!!,"December 28, 2017",3,"Good App, but could improve with some bug fixes Very nice App. Easy to book and communicate with host. But (the current version) could use some bug fixes. I use the App on my iPad Pro with the most recent iOS an when I scroll through my search results, the movement is extremely slowly, sometimes gets even stuck. Something is wrong here. Search filters are also not perfect. When I set for example my limit at $200 per night, the App shows me also accommodations above $200. Also, it would be great if the location filter would be narrower. If I search for housing in a certain town I don‘t want to see housing from near-by towns. Unfortunately, one sometimes only find out once you check the map, because the title often does not tell the location. Maybe adding a distance option would help (how far from target destination the search should be expanded). "
11,Smokentoken123,"January 2, 2018",1,"Nothing but problems I’ve had nothing but problems trying to make a reservation through Airbnb. My first reservation was cancelled due to me not completeing the verification process in time(long story short my account was set to eastern time instead of pacific time) I verified my account no big deal, I called customer service and was instructed to try and re-book, assured that my reservation would go through I did. I then received an email saying I needed to complete the verification process however when I clicked the link in the email I was taken to a page that said “You’re all set” and a button on the bottom saying “finish” I clicked the finish button and was taken to the home screen I assumed there was a glitch in the software somewhere. Three hours later I received an email saying my reservation was cancelled a second time for not completing the verification process in time. I was very confused as I had in fact completed the process and was not given an option to do anything further from the links in their emails. Now I’m being told by customer service to re-book my trip for a third time. I’m unsure if this is how they typically do business but I’ve received little to no help from their customer service team or the case manager assigned to help fix my problem."
12,"Cindy from Palm Desert, CA","May 10, 2018",5,"Loving Airbnb We used Airbnb during our recent holiday in Kona, HI and stayed in 3 different private units. Each was wonderful and had everything we needed including the loan of beach chairs, beach towels and umbrellas. We didn’t cook, but each unit was well appointed with everything we would need and next time we will enjoy creating our own meals at the units and eat out less. We enjoyed visiting briefly with each owner, they were all really nice but not intrusive at all. We went on two excursions recommended and booked through Airbnb. They were great and good value. I would recommend the Wild Dolphin & Snorkeling adventure with Captain Chase and the Local Brews & Poke Flights with Lottie and a wonderful chef and fun bartender at a beautiful golf course. They were both awesome and each was a small group of 5-6 people allowing us to ask our hosts questions and visit with the other guests. We will likely use Airbnb more often, it was super easy to book the units, more fun and less expensive than a hotel. When they say ‘Super Host’ believe it, book it and relax. I’m a fan and sharing our experiences with friends. Mahalo!"
13,DellDyn,"March 10, 2019",3,"Average Overall, I’ve had good experience with Airbnb, and I like the general set up. I do have two major major issues, and that is 1). with the tax collection. My county and total sales tax are 9%, But they only take out 6% and refuse to fix it. This causes me to lose so much money because I have to take it out of my profit and then file with the county and do my state taxes through an accountant because the system is too complex... Major inconvenience... and 2). This is my 2nd home. I do not want to rent it to just “anyone“. VRBO is better because they at least let you see the person‘s full name, and you can Google their information to make sure they are a real person, etc. There are so"
14,Ashley Feliz,"March 23, 2019",1,"Literally -5 stars if it were possible DO NOT USE AIRBNB. They have the absolute worst customer service. They deactivate accounts for no reason. They say you’ll receive a full refund and I have yet to see any of my money. They owe me more than $1,000... with that said please save your time and your money, don’t trust these people. My trip is supposed to be in 2 days I’ve had this booked for a month now and they cancelled my reservation and deactivated my account and I was told I’d receive a FULL refund. As far as the customer service all they say is that they’ll slap a label on it called “urgent” and that they’ll get back to me in 24 hours...got nothing. After I made my SECOND reservation after having my account deactivated, they then accepted my payment and a few minutes later I was told they cancelled my reservation and they’d send me a full refund I called them to see what was going on and where my money was and all they said to me was that he could do nothing about this, he has to send my case to another department and to “rest assured” it’ll be taken care of In 24 hours and as for my money.. as if it can get any worse I was told that my money is “technically in limbo” and that I need to contact my bank, contacted the bank and they said they haven’t gotten anything on their end... AIRBNB WHERE IS MY MONEY!?"
15,foxsoccerruinedstreamingsoccer,"April 20, 2019",1,"Worse experience than I could even imagine What a scam! DO NOT BOOK THIS!!!! It IS A SCAM!!! Unresponsive host ruined my trip to DC and made us late to the event we were in DC to attend. We tried to contact the host for check in instructions, and she did not respond, leaving us with no place to stay. We then had to scramble and find a friend to stay with after we no longer had a place to stay after we reached out to the host Tracy multiple times, via Airbnb messenger and phone, and eventually had to call Airbnb guest relations. The person on the phone (listed on the Airbnb as the host) said they were not the host and I had the wrong number. This is also on the shoulders of Airbnb, because of their negligence I did not know that there were several others who had similar experiences over the last couple months. I asked the very nice non-US based call center employee for an actual management response from Airbnb within 24 hours and never received the call. Airbnb offered nothing in reparations for their role in this issue, considering they have 4 other people who endured similar experiences and yet they gave no sanctions to this terrible host, and they gave me no warning about these issues they have known about for OVER 2 MONTHS, and therefore will be hearing from our attorney shortly for their negligence."
16,Emb 927363404,"April 25, 2019",3,"First experience with Air BnB is so-so I am traveling for just under a month and am using Air BnB for my travels. I am satisfied with most of my stats so far except one. This particular place was so dingy and run down that I immediately knew I did not want to stay there. Right away I contacted the host asking for the payment of my remaining two nights back so I could secure someplace else. She refused. So I contacted Air BnB and they too so long in figuring things out that I was well on to my next location by the time they said they had successfully negotiated a cleaning fee refund ($34). That was laughable. They told me I could dispute it further and asked me what was a fair compensation. I said that the fairest compensation was the two nights I had originally asked for. That would have been around $270. They negotiated some more and ended up refunding me $120. I am not impressed on the time it takes for them to respond and handle things, nor am I impressed with their negotiation skills. The place I stayed in was a dump and the pictures were a complete lie and they did nothing to fix that for future renters. I’ve now stayed in three other locations and I am very pleased with them. I like Air BnB but I don’t like their service."
17,julieandbobk,"May 13, 2019",1,"Terrible site/ company - no stars Spent multiple days calling or on hold with air bnb after they canceled a trip we booked for Key West. Their website allowed us to rent a unit that was not available. We were charged for the unit, then simply sent a text from another vacation site that our reservation was canceled.  No reason why! No one would tell us why, but it was glitch in air bnb software which no one would own up too.  Every case manager I was assigned too told me they would comp us a stay and send us new listings which never happened.  When a listing was sent it was not comparable to our initial booking.  Each day that passed the cost of the available air bnb units would increase in price, but no one would call me back to confirm another reservation.  Each case worker said they would call me back with in an hour.  No call backs! I am livid with air bnb, there are multiple sites that are a lot cheaper with the same units like VRBO, use them! Don’t book with this website!!  They are unreliable, they won’t care if you have a place to stay."
18,Robert Ryan,"May 29, 2019",3,"Problems taking photo on iPad Pro in landscape The app presents a little overlay where one can center the photo id capture, but running the app in landscape mode, the overlay was misaligned, with the overlay rectangle half off-screen. And when I disconnected it from the keyboard and rotated the device into portrait orientation, it put the overlay in the right place and everything looked rendered OK, but when I took the photo, it then grabbed the wrong portion of the photo. Bottom line, the photo capture got thoroughly confused with iPad in landscape orientation (which if you have a keyboard attached, is how we generally use these things). And when I first oriented the device into portrait, I happened to do upside-down portrait orientation (which iPads permit) and then the captured photo was upside down. Lol."
19,FoodVeggie,"July 13, 2019",1,"Horrible Customer Service!! If you can find a hotel or anything cheaper at a good price with even mild customer service, do it. Air BnB does NOT care about their customers at all!!! Dealing with Air BnB customer service has been the worst experience I have had with any business/support team. They can check the records and see that their staff AGREED with me and believed I deserved a refund for what was essentially unsafe conditions and poor communication from a host. However, after repeated attempts to receive said refund, they then claimed I had informed them too long after the reservation. They said this a week after my reservation but I had called DURING the first hour of check in for my reservation while I was AT the residence. I wish I had recorded their calls as they do yours, when dealing with customer support, and I would easily have enough evidence to show how they are misleading, careless about customer safety, and how they tell you one thing then flip to a completely different decision without the decency to call you to elaborate. They simply sent a short, rude message on the app. It is sad that they can agree with you (they can go ahead and listen to their recorded phone calls to prove it) and then message you something completely else and ignore the fact that they ever agreed with you. Ridiculous."
20,Bc2socal,"October 30, 2017",1,"Bad Customer Service Confusing app..  Great service until you run into the most minor issue.  I tried to modify a reservation and it turned into a complete nightmare of phone call after phone call with Patricia where I had to explain, reexplain and then explain again a very simple issue.  She claimed she needed to verify with the host and claimed she couldn’t reach him which was bizarre since the host said he never heard from her and was nothing but accommodating and responsive to me the entire trip.  I would recommend going directly to your host with any modifications or extensions of your trip or you’ll find yourself on the phone with Airbnb your entire trip, completely frustrated.  While she was nice she didn’t seem like she listened to a word I said. Now they continue to keep trying to take money for days I didn’t stay.  She claims she can’t reach the host but he’s a well respected doctor and we have mutual friends who are his neighbors so I’m inclined to believe his side of the story.  I would try home away vacation app instead (although I’ve never used, it but will be now). My family has properties listed on Airbnb and we will now be trying Home Away Vacation app instead as we don’t want or guests to have the same poor experience on their getaway."
21,Inn Bloom,"November 7, 2017",5,"♥️Airbnb I’ve been an Airbnb host and an Airbnb guest for over 3 1/2 years. I have hosted over 160 guests from all over the world, and all experiences have been wonderful. Not one bad experience. The places that we have stayed have been clean, friendly.... just exactly what we needed for where we were and what we’re doing. Again, as a host, I enjoy sharing my hometown with visitors and making them feel comfortable and welcome while enjoying the area. The extra money has been greatly appreciated as we live in an expensive area. Now with my husband retired, I am able to help with our expensive taxes and utilities, not to mention my health insurance which is extremely expensive since I am no longer covered by my husband’s employment. I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to contribute and be creative as a host at the same time, "
22,u may not like this but,"February 21, 2018",3,"Hard 2 c, find, use EVERYTHING. With this app is non- intuitive. Have they forgotten that “ease of use” , making text easy to read and find,  is what attracted people to the web in the first place? I drive LYFT/UBER too and I’ve taken Airbnb Programmers around S.f. Smug group generally.  Proud that they can “ force” u into certain behaviors. #AssinineArrogantBehaviors. I’ve said it before: clear bright text. Clearly organized pages and structure,  so we the users have an idea where ur going  as well as the program. Super-host” is meaningless. I’ve stayed in several “ super host” homes now, and all they did was set the bar REAL low so it is easy to hit expectations.  No difference between those folks and a hotel. "
23,yellow tail 23,"August 5, 2018",3,"Reimbursement- communication There was a guest I was hosting, they extended there stay for a extra day  after they checked in. I excepted the request and Airbnb gave the green light, I’m assuming to make sure the funds were available. That was on the Thursday they stay Friday which was the extra day and then checked out Saturday I got a email Friday morning at 1:30 in the morning saying the funds were not available. I then contacted Airbnb via email and the representative was saying if she could attempt to get the payment she tried she called then ask me if I would be willing to call the guest which I wasn’t at first then I decided that I could still reach out with a pleasant message long story short I got the payment through speaking with the guest. I asked to speak with the supervisor after messaging for four days waiting for the payment. The supervisor  called me back after the fact after I’d already retrieve the money and I feel like Airbnb wasn’t going to  reimbursed me.  I repeatedly asked the representative to reimburse me and then go collect it from the guest instead of putting me in the middle and I got nowhere I had to do it myself."
24,Asufhes,"August 13, 2018",3,"Good app except…… I enjoy all the features of this app. In fact I like all of the app with one gigantic exception… The calendar inconsistently works.  What I mean is when you open up your Airbnb app and you want to look at your calendar about 50% of the time it just hangs and will not open. All other features work but if you want to know who’s coming on what day your calendar won’t be helpful since half the time it doesn’t load. It doesn’t matter what phone you’re on it doesn’t matter if you’re on an iPad it doesn’t matter what computer… I’ve called over and over about this especially after seeing so many other people having the same issue. As a host it’s really inconvenient to not be able to see who is booking on what dates. Despite a history of this is a major issue for people, it’s still not fixed years later. So so annoying."
25,Zero stars!!!,"January 6, 2019",1,"BEWARE! Should you want a refund from a MOLD infested shack The worst experience EVER with their support team I have ever experienced. Recently rented a property in Puerto Rico of course you must pay in full, no problem excepting my money but when we arrived at the property it was nothing less than a dump not at all what the photos that were posted for the listing showed. Mold on the walls, floors, shower, smelly bedding, dirt dust missing floor tiles in the kitchen that expose the concrete below , a junkyard of a front yard, spiderwebs, clutter..... we could not even spend one night there. when I submitted the photos to THE AIR BNB they were passed on to three different individual case workers to who agreed that the place was disgusting and did not match the listing but she was not authorized so she transferred me to someone above her who never spoke to me once and ruled in favor of the host Who argued that this property was clean and nothing was wrong with it! which is completely inaccurate! In the end they are keeping our money and we did not spend one single night there this is for 14 days that they will gladly steel from their customers knowing that the place was A step above a rundown shack you may find crackheads squatting in. Airbnb might find them selves regretting to ignore the mold in the photos Porter Rico is part of America"
26,Awzum3,"April 25, 2020",1,"Unforgiving and Unhelpful! Airbnb did not refund any money for a situation that was out of my hands. I was studying abroad in Rome and planning to visit Barcelona from March 5-9, staying at an AirBnb rental. Our school mandated that we return to America on March 2nd due to the rising threat of Coronavirus, so we had no choice but to leave and could not attend our stay in Barcelona as planned. We lost all the money that we had put into this trip, even though it was not our fault. After contacting AirBnb support staff, they were not sympathetic at all towards our situation and they closed our case. We sent them all the right documentation that showed that we were forced to leave, but they did not care. Even with the credit card company involved, AirBnb still did not help us and we have not gotten any money back. We are students, so we don’t have a lot of money to begin with, and to lose that much money really is detrimental. I would have hoped that a huge corporation like AirBnb would be able to see that we are not at fault and that it’s unfair to take our money without giving some sort of refund, considering our safety was at stake. I will think twice before ever using this app and company ever again, because they definitely put their own greed before the needs of their customers."
27,D8796,"March 19, 2020",2,"App is fine. Customer is awful. Never had an issue using the app. However the company needs some work. A friend of mine created a group for us to look at cabins to rent, thus making them the ‘trip owner’, even though all they did was invite us to a group to share destinations with each other. We find one we all like, and I book it with my card. "
28,Some1withAcomputer,"July 16, 2019",2,"Push Notifications are Glitchy, amongst other things. Going on over a year now, and confirmed it with a newer phone, the PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DON’T APPEAR  half the time, if not less. (I.e the app badge, and banners). There were periods where was missing responses and threatening my response time stats because the app simply wasn’t notifying me that a message or inquiry has been received. Yes I’ve checked all the notification settings in the phone and app, and yes I’ve re-downloaded the app a handful of times. Still the app seems to spontaneously choose when to notify me of stuff. The work around is turning on texts and email as means of communication, but frustrating since now I’m forced to basically have triple versions of any given message, just to be safe I’ve mentioned this on the phone to them, but no real solutions were made obvious to me.

Their business I believe has saved my life and given me a chance to get back on my feet and be able to pay taxes again. Air is good for the US, State, local and citizen’s economy. Most of all.. my over 200 reviews tell the world that travelers like the idea of being able chose variety and unique spaces to relax at. But no competition can beat out Air’s experience providing quality app and customer service! Air is Super!!"
31,Mr. WAT112233,"December 25, 2018",1,"Choose another option I got the app, signed up, put in information to verify my account, and was locked out so they could review my information to verify. This is understandable. However, after two days and no reply, I contacted customer service and they said they could not help me and my account would be assigned to a case manager who would get back to me “shortly” to resolve my problem. Slightly irritating but still understandable. Two more days passed and I called customer service again and received the same reply, however they stated that they would get back to me within 48 hours from my original call. So now, 4 days have passed and still no reply and my case was not assigned to anyone. I waited another two days with still no response and had to find another site to book with as time was running out. NOW, OVER 3 WEEKS LATER, my vacation over with, I still have received no communication from Air B&B and my account is still locked, not even allowing me to look at the website. As, the company has grown you would thing they would expand their customer service, but apparently do not care to. Will not be using this service (as if I had a choice) in the future. There are better services out there."
32,takes too long to set up,"March 1, 2019",3,What a process to get started!!!! I got online to find a place to stay 47 minutes ago. I found a place right away and try to book it. When I got to the site where I finally do the confirmation it kept saying it wouldn’t except my card. When I got in touch with someone at Airbnb they said it was likely due to a problem with my bank. When I called the bank they explained to me that there was absolutely no charge from Airbnb and there would be no reason for them to refuse it so there’s no problem on their end. The guy at the bank told me he had issues trying to set up an account with Airbnb as well. The lady I was communicating with told me multiple times she had no idea what was going on and that they would never hold my credit card account for any reason. But when I finally downloaded the app and was able to create a profile apparently that was the hold up. In addition to that they didn’t want my credit card number and they did keep it on file. What a mess.  50 minutes later I finally have a place that would have taken 5 minutes on VBRO.
33,Long-time Fan and Follower,"August 2, 2019",1,"No longer supporting Airbnb due to discrimination I understand this is a review of the app - but would like to share my recent experience with Airbnb. A host left a review on my profile that was sexist and disgusting. Despite my entire history of perfectly treating Airbnb’s, the company refused to acknowledge the comment was sexist - conveniently, the two hosts were men and only acknowledged my partner (male), yet attacked me in the review. The Airbnb correspondent handling the case was also a man, who told me it was not discriminatory in his opinion."
34,Charlotte Dyess,"April 19, 2020",1,"Never using Airbnb or their services again With an understanding that COVID-19 has swept the nation, I understand Airbnb’s going through an influx of cancellations. That being said, the department of defense has issued a travel ban extending through June 30th. My fiancé and I had to cancel our wedding and flights to Florida and Hawaii due to this travel bad, as we are part of the military community. The venue and airlines, were understanding and provided us full compensation due to these troubling times. "
35,Horrible pop-ups,"April 11, 2020",1,"The worst customer support ever! If you’re planning on hosting you need to make sure you don’t use Airbnb! They’re the worst for helping you out. They don’t take the full amount from the guest and leave you hanging dry whenever there’s a payment issue. If they’re going to sit back and collect money from service charges, occupancy taxes, etc. they should also collect full payments from guests and release them as the dates approach. I had a issue with a guest staying 2 months and not paying anything the 2nd month. When I asked Airbnb about non payment they said they tried to collect and there was an issue with that. The guest ended up leaving in the middle of the night, stole numerous things, and didn’t pay. When I reached out to Airbnb they said they’d look into it. I had to do a reverse number search and come to find out this guest that was staying was defrauding people. AIRBNB Does a terrible job of actually filtering who’s using their platform. This lady has been convicted of nurse impersonation and battery and assault. Only reason I was able to find her actual last name was because I did my research. Stay away from Airbnb! They’re not there to help you at all. They haven’t even responded to me. It’s been a week!"
36,P. alexis,"January 17, 2020",5,Great customer service I had a potentially horrible stay at a host location. It smelled terribly of cat urine and feces as soon as the door opened. I set foot inside and realized the the bedroom light didn’t work and it was pitch black besides the flashlight on my phone. The front door wouldn’t close correctly unless you turned the deadbolt. Just ridiculous and smelly. Immediately called Airbnb for a refund and they responded amazingly. I provided pictures and video of the place and got a full refund and the host’s privileges were revoked. They also set me up with hotel accommodations for the night as it was late and no other Airbnb’s were available until the next morning. I spoke with the same person every single time which made customer service amazing because i didn’t have to retell my story and explain myself to a new person. The CS manager called me and emailed me within a very timely manner. It was all resolved in about 2 hours! I’m very happy with the service and will continue to use Airbnb.
37,tstecker,"June 10, 2019",1,"Support is thin at best, and hosts do whatever they want. The Air BB support is limited. I made a somewhat last minute reservation (1 week in advance) I was asked to pay additional money for tax direct to the host ($200+) None of the payment methods worked and no one answered the phone. Uncomfortable with the reservation I moved to cancel it. I was informed I would only receive $250 or the $1900 payment. Even though a booked it 24 hours earlier. I called Air BB support. Was put on hold for several minutes then told they would call me back. After 4 hours I sent a message which was answered shortly afterwards informing me that I would receive a call soon. 4 days later I called again. I was told that the payment request needs to go through Air BB platform and that the reservation could not be cancelled. Now stuck with a reservation I’m not happy with, I’m being forced to pay and move forward or forfeit $1700. I’ve had good experiences using this service but the last two bookings were not good. USE AT YOUR OWN RUSK! If the host is shady, Air BB cannot and will not help you resolve it to your satisfaction. Only the satisfaction of the faceless host. In this case a vacation company. Who never gave me a point of contact that actually worked."
38,HoneyBeee000333,"November 8, 2019",1,DO NOT BOOK WITH AIR BNB I booked a stay with air Bnb through a Guy named Vic in Decatur GA And was scammed out of my money. After booking a room for a week and the Host ACCEPTED my request AND payment; I contacted the host to receive instructions on how to enter the home and the host tells me the room is NOT available. The host then lies to the representative and tells them he said no such thing. The Representatives all (3) that I have spoken with all had NASTY attitudes and could not accommodate me for the POOR excuses and services that AIR BNB provides. Now I’m stuck outside in the cold with my children due to the negligence and poor services that this company provides. This is not the first time that this situation has occurred through Air BNB.I blame Air BNB for allowing people like Vic to continue to provide services and I Blame Air BNB For not allowing their customers whom spend their hard earned money to feel as though We are respected. They treated me like Trash and I would really hate to see someone else end up in a situation as such. So before booking with this company please weigh your options. They will give you a complete run around and there would be nothing you can do. It’s 30 degrees outside and now my only option is to wait on God. God bless America

All I hear are great things about these beautiful home, and everyone’s quick to look into Airbnb. I booked two different homes for my husband and I. My payment wasn’t denied when originally booking these places. BUT to complete my payment (pay the other half of my booking) my card is continuously declined. This is only after the host told me to cancel my entire trip I order to add ONE date. I’ve lost money, time. Airbnb is no help whatsoever and told me to just “keep trying” to make this payment. No one has apologized. No courtesy. Nothing. And my host continues to threaten to cancel my trip because my “payment isn’t being made”. If I cancel now I’ll lose 200+$$ never again. Hotels for now on. Update:: the second location we had booked for 6 days from now was just canceled by the host. No Airbnb’s in our price range are available anymore. And for a group of five a hotel is going to be double. Airbnb is a disaster. Ruined our entire trip, and literally profited off of it. Wouldn’t recommend anyone using this app, website or company until they make some serious changes to their policies and customer service."

My friends and I have been planning to book this specific room, and when we finally saved up, I tried to book it. My account was all set up, and when I booked it, it kept on giving me a “failed verification.” I sent a clear picture of my state ID and a clear picture of myself to have that verification cleared up. So I tried many times to book it, but it just wouldn’t go through. An hour later, I got an email saying that they couldn’t tell if I was the person on MY OWN ID. So I tried to get this cleared up asap and sent another verification. It takes them hours to verify. The beach house my friends and I have been saving up for is now booked by someone else, only because of this horrible app and how slow their process takes. I tried to keep in touch with the host of the house, but the host could not help me with this problem. It is impossible to contact the customer service, because it is not on their site. They expect you to get ALL of your answers from the Help Center, even though it DOES NOT provide everything. This leaves us no choice but to pay a grand for expensive hotel here in Hawaii.

45,Cougarwhiskers,"August 12, 2018",5,"Honest review Initially, Airbnb had many problems. Among them was poor customer service support. Recently, through their Twitter account, I receive nearly immediate responses to my Owner questions and problems. Yay! Their Service fees to guest have been higher than other sites like VRBO, however from an owner standpoint, they are currently not charging a 3% transaction fee on credit card and e checks that VRBO is charging, which significantly reduces owner profitability. They also do not have a screwy algorithm like VRBO that can significantly reduce visibility and page views. My only suggestion at this point to AirBNB is to include local and state taxes in the calculations for guest stays. These are now frequently required nearly everywhere and create confusion for guests in either having to post higher rental rates to include the taxes, or a surprise after renting that taxes are due by the guest. I have sincerely enjoyed working with AirBNB and have found the guests who have stayed to be informed, responsible and communicative."

49,app enthusiast 1,"July 28, 2019",1,"Terrible for hosts Airbnb as a publicly traded company is not mature with regards to its hosting functionality and support.  There have been multiple instances where I have been woefully unsupported as a host.  For instance, when a user made a stay extension request hours before scheduled check-out, with a declined credit card...airbnb granted the extension and requested that the host sort out the payment issue with the user...then airbnb charged the host $100 for “host canceling” the reservation that technically already ended, stating that they don’t have the functionality to cancel an extension specifically.  Or when my listing required an additional person charge, which a user lied to get around, not considering that the host checks guests in personally, and often hosts can count. In this instance, airbnb again said there’s nothing they can do, and that the host had to pursue the discrepancy with the user directly. And at the tail end of it, when the user writes an angry review that obviously impacts future profitability, airbnb refused to take it down..  If other hosts have had similar experiences and have suffered losses due to airbnb’s inept management and lack of accountability, there may be remedies to pursue collectively!"
50,Spazzfx,"October 3, 2017",4,"Great service, not so great app Air bnb has been extremely helpful for us over the past few months. We have an extra room in our house and we rent it out through Air bnb which has been very successful and making us some much needed extra money in tight times. It was also very helpful while we were traveling overseas. It saved us a large amount of money booking rooms not in an expensive hotel. There are some risks using the service since you never know what kind of person you are booking from and the space where you will be staying isn’t always as nice as it’s presented in the listing. "
51,Silverlake dteaming,"May 27, 2018",5,"A++ customer service Airbnb is a leader in today’s emerging app based economy. Not only do they provide fun, safe, and interesting places to stay, but their customer service is unparalleled. You can be sure that they will consider each case personally, and individually. The majority of my rentals have gone very smoothly, but every once in a while there is a hitch. Each time I’ve encountered a problem I’ve had an Airbnb employee contact me personally, make sure they understand the full situation on both sides, and come to a resolution in which all parties feel satisfied, and supported. Their customer support employees are obviously given the responsibility to make their own decisions based on individual facts, opposed to older, outdated models of customer services where employees are trained to respond with blanket statements, or form emails. Hopefully, other companies will follow Airbnb’s lead, and start to offer services customers can trust, and feel loyal to again."

54,uwishuknew1972,"February 17, 2020",1,"Not my favorite thing I was always hesitant to use this app because of all the extra fees hosts would impose. Booking fees, cleaning fees, etc. More than 1 location has extra fees themselves out of my business. I’m used to staying in hotels where CLEANING is included with the rate and it’s just been simpler and cheaper to book a hotel room. However, when I started doing more international travel and interested in experiencing these countries similar to what the locals experience, I’ve tried booking through the Airbnb app. My main criticism at this point is how quickly they take funds versus how slowly they release refunds. And the issue is not with my bank. Airbnb is holding my money. Nevermind that, by them doing this, might prevent someone from booking another place. Just ridiculous for them to keep funds for so long. I can’t recommend them or this app to anyone. Stick with hotels. I’ve had to cancel hotel reservations before and didn’t lose anything. Funds not even taken until the day of check-in. I booked the Airbnb a month before scheduled check-in and cancelled immediately. Almost 3 weeks later and I’m still waiting for my refunded money. A whole mess."
55,mixedmedia65,"November 19, 2019",3,"Changing my rating I’ve used airbnb very happily for more than a year as i’ve travelled around the US working as an RN, but i recently had a really bad experience with a host and airbnb gave me the runaround for two weeks before closing my case without even really talking to me. If they had been upfront and told me that i wasn’t going to get my $1000 back instead of leading me on about a mediation that was supposed to happen, i wouldn’t have been happy but at least i wouldn’t have felt lied to. Last time i talked to them a few days ago  i was told that another case manager would call me. Needless to say that didn’t happen. I use airbnb for the good people out there offering up their homes and there are still plenty of them out there. Be careful when you’re setting up long term rentals because it’s very easy to lose large amounts of money without anyone at airbnb blinking an eye about it. In fact, they seem to employ a lot of people who will say whatever they need to say in order to get you off the phone. Good service, poor customer support."

When we got there and were ready to check in, the host decided to let us know that the bathroom hasn’t been working and they weren’t home to fix it. We called Airbnb and they gave us a refund, and began to help us find another bnb in the area. 4 hrs later we have nowhere to go, a car full of our belongings and the person responsible for “helping us” left for the day without even letting us know she was leaving or providing an additional place to stay. Now 3 days later the host hasn’t been flagged and is still allowed to rent out their space with no bathroom, and the people working for Airbnb are acting all of this time wasted and inconvenience isn’t their problem. Luckily we were only a state away from our home and could figure it out, but we’ve used this company multiple times out of the country, and the thought of this happening in a setting like that and their staff talking down to us like us being inconvenienced is a burden on them is why I will never use them again"

The cancellation policy is not even close to being as good as vrbo’s cancellation policy, and I don’t think that the cancellation policy that is in place due to corona virus is fair at all. (Airbnb gives 50% MINUS the service fee, after you cancel 48 hours from booking) they have changed their policy to offer 100% refunds for reservations made before March 14th, and for the bookings that are before mid-April. It is not certain that the pandemic will be continue after mid-April and it will most likely be continuing in the summer. With that being said, those families who will have no choice but to go out of town to their reservations in the summer to avoid losing their money will be put in danger of the virus by this very company. I wish I had booked through Vrbo, who has an extremely flexible cancellation policy and lower prices. (They give a full refund of the booking if you cancel by a closer date before the reservation, and their prices are lower for the SAME quality of places to stay) I will not be recommending this app to anyone traveling and I will never be using this service again for my future travels. 🤠"

I asked him nicely and he started insulting me and being rude and unprofessional! I reached out to air bnb customer service and they agreed it was absurd but they told me I needed to deal with the host myself.. I ask him to return all my money and he declined, I spoke to another rep and she said she would call the host to find an agreement and said she would call back in 10-15 mins and never called me back.  For my first time using this app it’s been nothing but a headache and has given me so much stress.. so now I’m out $180 that they won’t refund for a misleading listing and a host that is disrespectful keeps my money.

Airbnb refunded the money from the bed bug infested house that they certified after 6 weeks. They never offered to cover any other expenses.  I decided to try them one more time.  After the third time, I rented a house that offered WiFi and TV. These are basic amenities for any house. The WiFi never worked and the TVs were Internet TVs so none of the televisions worked.  I had brought this to the attention of the host 12 hours before.  She would not do anything about so I complained to Airbnb.  Their solution was for me to leave the last night around 10 PM.

They refused my request even the host him self ignored it. I made contact with the team and they cared less for my issue instead they helped the host to take the money. I never got refund and I will never use this app again.

I will continue to tell my friends and family what kind of poor service we have been provided and will cancel every account I have with this disgraceful company. We drove 10 hours, had 4 people flying in from all across the country and have not been helped whatsoever. We have been given fake coupon codes, hung up on, assigned 4 different “case managers”, and told that we will not be reimbursed any money but rather charged more for last minute booking on a new place. While I understand things happen, the fact that such a large and well known company doesn’t have the ability nor the want to help their guests when THEY put us out last second is baffling and unacceptable. I will never be using Airbnb again, and I highly recommend anyone else considering them to think twice before they do, too."
69,lacey304vegas,"October 18, 2019",1,"Discrimination experience I loved Airbnb until they showed us their true colors and banned my husband and I because HE has a criminal record from 15+ years ago.. MY record is sparkly clean but since he is traveling with me they banned my account to. After thousands of dollars we have spent staying across the country using Airbnb.. we couldn’t believe how they treated us. MAYBE the background checks should be done prior to letting guests stay in peoples homes.. We are on a 7 week long road trip and are now forced to stay in hotels because we travel with our dog. This experience with Airbnb is ridiculous, and I will from now on advise everyone who uses this app to STOP spending their money on such a rude company. Banning guests without a warning by email, or phone call. Airbnb should have more consideration for others, and they should have a proper customer service phone number with representatives that actually can give you a straight answer and solve your problem the first time without giving you a runaround. One VERY unhappy customer with good lawyers is all it takes for a booming company like this to be.. haha"
70,101Micheal,"June 26, 2018",3,"Lost lists Overall, I absolutely love the app, it's easy to find homes almost anywhere. My main concern is the fact that most of my lists of homes have gotten erased. I spent an extensive amount of time saving homes in many, many different areas, when I went to check back on the lists, I realized most of them had been erased...which means that I'd have to take the time to restart all of them, which would end up pointless, because other lists would end up getting erased. I'll take a guess that there is a limit of lists on the app, which I must say is bs and I would recommend you guys allow people to make as many lists as they want. I have also noticed that the search engine doesn't provide a list of related areas anymore, if you are to type in a city or place. This causes issue because now you have to weirdly specify what exact area you are talking about. These are the only two main problems I see with the app, I would like to see these problems fixed."

I’ve been using them for years and did not have a problem until we recently checked into our Airbnb in Maui Hawaii. The place was riddled with bugs! They’re called coconut condos, do not stay there! Anyway, we had to cancel on the spot and Airbnb refused to refund my money. We couldn’t stay there, there were ants everywhere, I have video, but Airbnb didn’t want to see that. Then they closed my complaint ticket before we even returned from our vacation!! The told me in a message that the refund policy stated that there would be no refunds. This is all on top of us having to find a hotel to stay in the last minute. Then, THEN, after contacting AirBnB and telling them about the problem - THEY DELETED MY ENTIRE TRIP FROM MY PROFILE - which makes it impossible for me to go back and leave a review of the place we had to cancel because it was infested with bugs!!! I couldn’t even get arm others!!! AirBnB only likes great reviews I guess, but if you have a bad experience it’s “F*** you, no refund and you can’t share your experience.” Stick with VRBO."

73,emma13975,"September 9, 2018",1,"Bad Customer Service, Only Avoids Responsibility Reputation of a company is earned in crisis management.  Been a super host for a long time, and recently had a guest who left early and had reservation shortened.  We agreed with case manager to refund guest the rest of days the guest did not stay, yet somehow the case manager later cancelled the entire reservation and refunded the guest fully.  Now I’m left with no pay out for hosting this guest for days.  I’ve been contacting Airbnb customer service for quite a while, and the only response I got is that the case is being handled and they will reach out to me.  However, I never hear back from Airbnb within the time frames they promised.  I could never get in touch with the case manager who is working on this issue, and every time I called, representative on the call didn’t know what was happening.  I could only assume Airbnb does not want to pay host for hosting after Airbnb has mistakenly refunded guest in full.  If this is the way Airbnb chooses to treat hosts, I could only suggest other hosts to have a plan B, because once you run into a problem with any guest or with Airbnb, you are in it on your own."

I don’t like the fee Airbnb charges both our guests and us. They have taken more than $600 from individual renters over the summer. When I called to make sure that was right, I was told the percentage they take varies from 6-15% depending on the place and time of year. It seems only fair that the percent be the same across the board. "

Oh no, I get communication from the host that now I must go through their approval process. Very long drawn out list of rules and some where I was supposed to send them lots of personal info. They have already said I had the room and they have my money. I was confused because I am a senior and was trying to do this on my phone and was tired. I have never been asked anything like this before. I just asked them if I had the room or not and told them I did not not understand what they wanted. I told them I wanted to cancel and they said I still had a legal obligation to pay them even though they had never once said that I was “approved"" for the room. I complained to Airbnb and was told they would investigate. Nothing from them but the host has since messaged me and accused me of being drunk, insulted and berated me all because I said I would not sign their additional paper work agreeing to all kinds of stuff I have never been asked before. I think this is fraud and misrepresentation."
76,Fitty Cents,"May 19, 2019",1,"Shady and worst customer services Apparently allows the host to cancel the reservations last minute that can cause or mess up your vacation plan. Top of that customer services come up with complimentary coupons of $10-15 what a freaking waste of your money, time and more importantly your vacation precious times for which you have paid so much more than Airbnb reservation fees truly the worst customer services. I told them to keep $13 that was offered to me cause host cancelled my reservations at 6:30 pm when my check in time was 3:00 pm. I was told by customer services that this perfectly okay for host to do and they will give me $13 to make up for it. I had a toddler and my wife traveling with me I had to just cancel all my plans for the day and find another place at 7:00 pm so we can at least have a place  to sleep and pay premium fees for the last minute booking. Way to make money AirBnb your business and corporate policies will be shared with in my friends and family circle along with on social media. Hope you made money and also I know you guys don’t care much about your customers much."

Our experience was terrible because once we arrived it was weird that the house had no curtains up till the third floor. When we entered the place there was a nasty odor. Another thing the host wasn’t honest about his post he didn’t mention that there was also another house in front and the back. With the house having no curtains there’s no privacy was so ever and if there was other people they would have seen everything. From the bad odor there was we decide to leave and we decided to call Airbnb the manager who attended us was Juan and he couldn’t help us because the host said there was no bad odor and we weren’t able to get a refund. We would have to have proof of the bad odor to be able to get a refund. It didn’t matter if we didn’t get a refund we able to post about our bad experience and it wasn’t fair that there was no honesty what so ever. We never had any bad experience with Airbnb this time it sucked that weren’t able to get the help that we needed which was a disappointment as a guest.

I don’t know who you Karen, I’ve never seen your high class here before. Then you try one of these new remodeled homes to put your parents up since you live in a barely affordable 600 sq ft home with spouse and two kids. When you help Gigi get her luggage into the 400$ a night swanky modern bungalow you notice an ant infestation. You call the SUPER host who doesn’t return call. You call Airbnb who tells you to contact host. Gigi goes to a hotel because of the ants infestation and Airbnb refuses to refund and the host blatantly lies.

79,xxinfinity,"January 25, 2020",1,Doesn’t care about sexual assault I was the victim of sexual assault at an Airbnb location and was unfortunately more traumatized by AirBnB and law enforcement. I was put on extensive holds by Airbnb when I tried to report it even after I told them what happened. More than 15 minutes. And no one got back to me. I think they were just trying to get rid of me. When I emailed them after cancelling the reservation they sent me a very adversarial email demanding a police report and basically saying I was a liar. I actually went to the police and they didn’t want to deal with it and it was more traumatic because they didn’t think I’d drive back for the prosecution since I was from out of town and so they didn’t want to do any work on a Sunday when no one was at the office in this small town. I will never stay at an Airbnb alone and with a host again. And beware Airbnb doesn’t care about victims. FYI you can’t get a police report immediately after an incident and even so you just got a number for the report not the full report. They were obviously just trying to revictimize me with this ridiculous request.

Instead of moving my stuff at the end of the reservation I extended it for 3 days. For some reason it did not save. I discovered this right after the original check out. I called the homeowner who said call air bnb. It has been an hour and a half. After the first 30 minutes I was told that I would need to speak to a case manager, she transferred me and I held for 20 more minutes. I was then transferred back to the original rep who said all the case managers were busy I asked to speak to a supervisor, and expressed my frustration at paying $170 for a service fee and when I call not being able to speak to someone who can help with my problems. I was told I was being put on hold and transferred to no sound just me on hold for over ten minutes. I hung up called back waited explained what had happened asked to speak to a supervisor and then I was told the original rep I had spoke to was about to call me back and I should end the call and keep the line open.

81,Meg2018!!!!!!!!!!!,"June 19, 2018",1,"Terrible Company I will never use Airbnb again. I had one bad experience and it was enough to throw me off them for good. When making a reservation you are supposed to receive the hosts actual address but I only received the protected address that gives you an idea of where they live but not the location. Turns out my host was out of the country and her 18 year old son was supposed to let me in. Well when I arrived in the vicinity of her neighborhood I spent over an hour walking around, calling, and messaging her with no response, no idea where to go, and no way to contact her son. I finally had to book a hotel room. At midnight that night I got a message back from her and was able to stay at her place the next night. I would have just cancelled if she didn’t have such a strict cancellation policy. It’s been over a week since I made a case with Airbnb and the host only gave me half my money back for the first night and I haven’t heard a thing from Airbnb’s customer service. So disappointed. I have seen so many complaints about hosts doing what they want with no repercussions."
82,bbdow30,"August 30, 2018",4,"Convenient but inconsistent Love how easy the app is to use, but the inconsistencies are frustrating. Hosts can enforce their own policies, but the app has its own that are misleading. For example, at what age does a child become an adult? Each host may advertise what they define as “children are free”, but the app asks for adults and children based on a child being from 2-12 years old. Also, our most recent host doesn’t charge the credit card immediately, but the app says 50% due up front. I didn’t know until I was committed to the reservation whether I was paying now or later. Some things may be minor to some people but deal breakers to others. I’m a huge fan of truth in advertising. Would like to see these details (including advertising ALL the HIDDEN FEES) up front so I can compare properties effectively up front and make a rational decision, rather than starting my relaxing vacation feeling frustrated or hoodwinked."

Out of the blue they disabled my account and could not tell me why. Their customer support team treated me with little respect and before I could get ahold of someone I was hung up on 4 different times. When I finally reached someone they told me there was nothing that could be done. A day later I receive an email from someone reviewing my case telling me they are not obligated to tell me why they disabled my account and I won’t be able to get it back. The only thing I can figure is I logged onto my account through a friends phone. If that is the case that’s very disappointing. Not to mention, over the phone, they made me repeat my personal information multiple times while telling me I’m being recorded. I felt like I was dealing with the cops or something, so strange.

He is warm, funny, and extremely knowledgeable about the area, both it’s history and it’s current hidden gems.  It lasted 3.5 hours and it was so much fun it felt like 10 minutes.  If you like walking, learning about the non-touristy sites of the area and music I highly recommend this tour.  As an added bonus, Silvio had a playlist with him of all different types of music, all of which had lyrics or cinematic connections to Notting Hill or Portobello Road in common.  And, as promised, Silvio sent me a copy of the playlist, pictures of what we saw, and trailers from films, the following day.  He is prepared, thorough and a very nice guy.  Highly recommended!"

As a first time user of Airbnb, I was a little nervous until I found out I could practically rent out someone’s apartment. I had thought I had to share it with someone which I didn’t like the idea of. Being an introvert, this option was perfect. I accidentally booked an apartment that I had to share with the host and I quickly canceled. Sadly, the host didn’t return the money. After contacting customer service, they swiftly returned the money out of their own pockets because they saw I was a new user and wanted my first experience with them to be amazing. I was ecstatic to say the least. After the initial mess up on my part, I found a great apartment for a great price in LA. Loved my stay in a clean apartment that was hosted my a professional host.

I have learned so much About other countries and other cultures without having to leave my home. As far as Airbnb as a company, I cannot give them enough props. The very few times I have had an issue they have handled it over the phone courteously and efficiently They have an excellent Phone app which is so easy to use     Their program and pay routine was well thought out.

If there were a strong alternative to Airbnb, I’d use it immediately. Directions almost never work. Linking to a map application fails every single time. Navigation is poor, as is the photo viewing in different types of views. In some, you can click to view a whole photo, in others you can’t, and those times are usually when you especially want to see an image. Some data is also not saved on the app, so you need access to the internet to see things like conversations with a host. Really critical stuff when you’re traveling abroad with often no internet. This app is the definition of “death by a thousand paper cuts.” I’m only writing this in hopes the dev team will see it and review their priorities. I honestly have not seen a change to this app in three years, which makes me believe they are rebuilding the entire thing. I just reluctantly use the app anyway, because the alternatives are sparse."

They then didn’t get back to me about our issue until 3 days before our flight. This was the worst experience I have ever had and I will NEVER use them again. Do not use them if you have flights to leave somewhere. It’s too risky. Not only that the place I booked I booked directly with them after and save $400!!!! Airbnb is a joke. Use VRBO! Same thing but better. I’m surprised Airbnb is still in business the way they handle your vacations and make you wait last minute to panic. They also have 3 different teams and you can ONLY talk to customer service which can do NOTHING for you. You have to wait for an email from one of the other teams which do not get back to you until over a week later. I wish I could give this zero stars. It deserves negative stars.

If you are renting a whole place for an extended time it is probably great. For a room for the night it is not the best. We ended up in a kids bed for the night because we booked last minute, the host asked us to arrive late, and when we arrived she told us she overbooked and the room she advertised was not available. At that point it was late and we had no place else to go. In the morning she asked us not to write a review because she was getting divorced and didn’t want her husband to know we had been there. That is an awkward situation that you don’t deal with at a hotel. I also think it is hard to pinpoint the location of where you are staying if you are not familiar with an area you might end up in a residential area far (20 mins or more) from where you want to be."

According to the Barcelona police many Airbnb are used as a trap for visitors. One of most incredible parts of this journey has been the utter disregard by Airbnb corporate. No call backs, limited email follow ups, comically ridiculous solutions. The customer service is absolutely atrocious and clearly shows no regard for their customers. Please also note that while Airbnb covers damage to hosts it does not cover damages to guests. What is also shocking is that immediately after getting robbed (with the police suspecting a trap) Airbnb will continue to list that apartment on their website for booking with no warning whatsoever. Everyone be careful out there and if you can just book area hotel. Saving money now doesn’t mean anything when you have been robbed blind."
108,0988636,"February 23, 2020",1,Don’t Use Airbnb! I booked a room in the beginning of January for February and the day before my check in date Airbnb deleted the whole account and cancelled the reservation that I PAID MY MONEY FOR with no reasoning at all I called three different times all they would tell me is they don’t know and that I’ll get my money back in 5-7 days. Then I booked again and it comes to the time I’m suppose to check in and no ones answering I called the host text the host and all she didn’t answer so I called Airbnb ONCE AGAIN and they only told me to keep trying to get into contact and they will call me back in 15 minutes and finally the host contacted me saying she thought it was cancelled Airbnb contacted her saying that the page was deleted again with no explanation. I have lost over 300 dollars that I needed and no I have to wait 5- 7 days for all my money and I then had family from California come to visit with no place to stay it’s so unprofessional and they don’t tell you anything or give you a reasoning for anything I would rather get a hotel
109,ffjkkkllllmmnbvccdddf,"December 31, 2019",1,"Horrible Unreliable, they drag their feet to fix any issues I’ve ever had or extreme delay to reply to any of my concerns. Took weeks to get money back for one booking where a guy literally became mentally abusive and felt physically unsafe around  so I had to cancel the rest of my stay and that took weeks to fix! Not the most safe app if you’re a female especially as they don’t do much background Checkings on the hosts . Airbnb cares mostly about your money not safety . Also if you book a place and it’s status is “pending to be accepted” by the host they still charge your credit card automatically which is so stupid and inconvenient because now you have to wait till the transaction goes through and then get your money back to your account later.. while you wait you can’t really afford to use your credit card till you get your money back . Also the prices are consistently going up and down while they likely pocket that money .. Frauds!! Can’t wait till a better app comes around to wipe the out of business .. karma! :)"

111,Traveling Teatime,"September 22, 2018",4,Great choices I love the well described property listings. The many pictures posted on every home is a great way to help you decide which home is right for you. The things that I don’t like about the app is that you don’t get the exact city you want on the search. It will include homes in various cities all around. If there are a lot of homes to choose from this makes it difficult. They don’t post the name of the city on the first picture of the home where the title is. You have to click on that home and then you can see the city name. It wastes a lot of time while choosing a place. Also I don’t like that the price can display on the front page so inaccurately. It may say $100 per night but once you click on details there can be up to $150 or more in various added charges like cleaning and service fees. This also wastes a lot of time.
112,Ms. Hend,"December 2, 2018",1,"Terrible experience. My 30 B-day trip experience. I am so very shocked by Airbnb services. I’ve contacted them twice regarding a security issue I had with a host and they didn’t even have the courtesy to contact me back. Well, I am sure I won’t be using this service anymore and definitely won’t be recommending it to any either. Here in Qatar, no one trust it anyway and people been discouraging me from using Airbnb but they were right and I was very wrong to go against what’s better. I rented an apartment from an Airbnb listing only to find out that the apartment’ host doesn’t have a permit to actually rent the apartment, the lift was almost taken out of order and the internet was down for almost half of the trip oh and I arrived to an apartment where tile work was being in the process right by it. I basically paid for way too noisy place and services that I didn’t get. And guess what? That was during a trip I booked for my 30th birthday. Terrible experience to say the least. Also, they didn’t let me submit a review of my experience. TERRIBLE! 👎👎👎👎👐"
113,tucsonangry,"January 19, 2019",1,"Horrible This is the first (and absolute last) time my wife has tried Airbnb. Your site is, without exception, the most useless and user unfriendly site we have experienced. There is no help, the system is beyond confusing. It took us two hours communicating with the owner over the “reply” system just to finally get the reservation and we find out today that the reservation was canceled because my wife’s picture “wasn’t clear enough). We didn’t open the message in time and as a result we are now “homeless”. We needed the house to stay in while we closed on our current home and than closed on our new home -a one week difference. I am beyond angry with your useless site. I, clearly, will never use your site again and I will go out of my way to badmouth Airbnb and advise anyone who asks me not to use Airbnb. I will spread this experience we have had as often as I can. My only hope is that it will cause some people who might otherwise use Airbnb, not to.  I want to thank you for making a stressful time even more stressful."
114,customTUNE,"February 3, 2019",1,"Terrible Service - Host Stole From Me Airbnb doesn’t do well with customer service.  I am a new Airbnb user.  I booked a room for Valentine’s Day weekend.  My room was host told me to cancel the room because he couldn’t chance the book date and need to do maintenance . I cancelled and only received half of my money...basically if the host cancels they get a penalty, so being a new user they took advantage of me.       I made multiple attempts to contact customer service by calling and via message.  They said they have to escalate my call but never call back and via message they close my case.  I WILL never use Airbnb again and suggest you do not attempt to if you don’t want to be swindled.  Not only that...I booked restaurants and event based on my Airbnb...not it’s so hard to find something nearly as close or ideal.  Very disappointing.  Even the $40 coupon I received because my friend sent and invite to first time users I don’t think you could pay me to use this.  It’s simply customer service...at this point I see Airbnb doesn’t VALUE THE CUSTOMER."
115,Fan6758,"November 8, 2019",1,Horrible customer service! I tried to book a house which said it was available for an upcoming weekend. I was charged the full price for the house even though I was then told the owner first needs to approve the weekend (why am I being charged if I don’t even have the reservation?). Houses should not be listed as available if people cannot book them.
116,Ayauna,"March 21, 2020",5,"Still a Fan, and it Only Gets Better Since finding AirBnB a few years ago, I can’t imagine staying at any location other than those listed in such a game-changing experience. In the past I’ve used ”glamping” sites and ”Flipkey,” and I’ve had amazing experiences in those stays, but AirBnB’s listings have afforded me the luxury of staying at unique homes I’d never have the opportunity to stay at otherwise. I’m a writer and artist, and the landscape and tranquility of these spaces, inspired some of my best work. Whether I stay a short walking distance from my campus, or needing a spur of the moment mindfulness staycation,I’m an unwavering fan. I hope they continue to improve- find a medium which is beneficial to not only those who share their space or host, but to guests looking for the 5-star service we all enjoy."
117,bcamp87,"January 23, 2020",1,"I would give negative stars if I could I only used Airbnb once and it was the worst travel experience I’ve ever had. On top of that, you can’t get customer service to help you or talk to you at all!! I stayed at a house grossly misrepresented, the back door  didn’t have a lock, incredibly old and in awful condition, two rooms were not pictured in the listing and were hideous with furniture I was afraid to sit on and the electricity went out three times. I didn’t even spend the night, asked for a refund and even had my review taken down! They apparently cater to the renter and not the rentee. I sent over 15 messages because they don’t have customer service reps who will help via phone, they tell you to go online and you never get a response and I called three times with no resolution. I felt unsafe and wasted $500. I just deleted my account and will never use this service again. I hope you don’t have a terrible situation like bed bugs, safety, or inadequate housing because you will never get help, moved elsewhere or compensated."
118,Palmer640,"April 1, 2020",1,"Closed account for seemingly no reason- can’t contract support. I booked a week at an apartment close to work, I often travel very far for work. It was confirmed and went through, the money came out of my bank account and everything was in order. So I asked the owner when it’s acceptable to check in. I had a brief conversation with the owner about acceptable check-in times. Instead my money was refunded and then my account was closed. Airbnb cited a criminal record as the reason but when I checked with the background checking service, they couldn’t even find my info, when they ran a new check it cleared- meaning it was completely clean. "
119,kyfie,"July 23, 2019",1,Air b&b I will never be using air b&b again . We booked a place while visiting out of country and after it was booked and paid for the guy texted us and told us the address changed . We let it go and did it anyway. The owner of the building confronted us outside stating we were not allowed to be there and he was going to call the police . The air b&b is clearly not able to even be one and there were multiple false advertisements that occurred with the listing . Never should someone pay through an app like this and get threatened to be kicked out of what they are paying for . Or for that fact get threatened to have the cops called on them in a whole different country. Air b&b is not taking any of this as a priority or handling this seriously. We paid for a place and are getting threatened. This should be an automatic refund. This is just not acceptable . Be careful when you book through them and take note that they may not be helpful if your stranded in a situation even when you have proof it was all misrepresented.

121,Somethingbox,"March 16, 2018",4,"Love Airbnb as a company! App & site glitchy My SO and I have found the features and data collected by the app in concert with the site frustrating. It’s not consistent nor clear where certain features are for one. And once I start entering data and want to edit it later, I find some of it dropped! So it’s really unclear if the work is saved or nor or how to save it. Some things are just easier to type out on a full keyboard (like access instructions), yet I can only access that feature on mobile. Fees are also unclear and un-guessable. If someone requests a percentage discount, the site is no help in figuring out how to translate that to a dollar value to offer, which is time consuming and frustrating. The app really should be able to do that for us, but alas... "
122,EffAirBNB,"July 8, 2018",1,"Least User Friendly App EVER The app is totally janky, continuously loading random pictures while you’re trying to push buttons, so when you press a button the screen drops and takes you to a different place, and you have to start all over again."
123,MI weddings,"August 15, 2018",5,Trusting and trustworthy This is my 4th year as an Airbnb hostess. I’ve met THE nicest people and had some great conversations with people from all over the world. I appreciate the review and verification system Airbnb has in place because it always helps me in evaluating who to let into my home. Plus the rating system also lets guests know that I’m trustworthy too. Great reciprocal system. A bunch of us had to stand up to our township when some other Airbnb hosts didn’t monitor their guests and almost ruined the opportunity for all of us. We eventually got the government to create a policy that was Airbnb friendly. You may have to do the same. It’s worth it. Meeting great folks and earning income that helps me stay in my home are both important to me. I love Airbnb and am so appreciative of the opportunity. Thanks Airbnb!!
124,relaxwithmark,"September 10, 2018",5,"Loved the map option to locate bnb's close to my activities. I prefer a place to myself, rather than a room at a place occupied by the owner.  It was a bit difficult to discern which was which.  Impossible to tell via the location map, which I wanted to go by.  So I had to repeatedly look at both back and forth all night for hours, between the 'list' and the 'map'. It was nearly impossible to contact the owner to ask permission to check in early.  And a payment issue was not identified to myself, until I was almost there.  I had no booking.  And I had to scramble to figure out if that was true or not and re-book.  It all worked out.  But not until I borrowed a computer to better see why the issue was, since I couldn't figure it out on the app."
125,Just Anther Traveler,"October 16, 2018",1,"I’m Done with Airbnb I used to love Airbnb until I had problems trying to cancel one of my reservation. I got an email for Airbnb saying my trip was canceled but then they only gave me half of the refund and kept my reservation for a day (when the email and cancelation policy said I would be receiving my full refund and both days were canceled.) I messaged their support team through Airbnb and got NO WHERE. I even sent them pictures of the email I got from them, saying it was canceled. I then tried calling Airbnb and they said they couldn’t do anything because it was being processed through there “trip team.” They couldn’t even give me an answer on when they were going to contact me since they couldn’t transfer me over to them through the phone. Now, since it’s past the date to get the refund, they are saying that the host is denying my request to cancel the trip. I’M NEVER USING AIRBNB AGAIN. Just wait until you have a problem with one of your reservations and you’ll see how horrible those costumer service is!!"
126,Stranded in NY,"July 10, 2019",1,"Don’t book Used this service for the first time and the booking was a disaster. Superhost could not provide me with the apartment that I had reserve weeks in advance. Instead superhost Matt offered me one night at another location and the rest of my 6 day stay somewhere else. I agreed due to the fact it was late and I needed a place to stay for me and my family. On the second day I asked superhost Matt if I could leave my bags since I was going to go to sightsee and he said sure, without telling me that the place was booked that night by someone else. I had message him if someone was staying and he said no. He could not answer calls and there was no other way to reach him. Eventually person who booked place tossed my luggage out of apartment. Airbnb could not get me a place and I decided to ask for full refund which I did. However finding a hotel in New York was much more expensive and they refused to cover the difference . All they could offer was a coupon for 100 dollars. I will never use this service."
127,Itschmee,"November 4, 2019",1,"No One Upholding Standards Altogether, we booked 2 trips through Air BNB. The first one was awful and not as represented in the listing, so Air BNB refunded our money and gave us a credit towards another stay which was nice. The second place which was to make up for the first reservation was infested with cockroaches which we have pictures of. We reached out to the host who said she would refund us. After 2 weeks of no resolution, she said she had reached out to Air BNB and they were going to resolve it. That was 2 weeks ago and I’ve not received any type of contact or communication from Air BNB about it. My partner and I both took off work unpaid for each of the trips we booked through Air BNB, but did not get to enjoy any of the time. I will never use Air BNB again, and will warn friends and family from booking with Air BNB as well. We have since reserved a hotel room with a jacuzzi tub for a weekend, as we know it will be relaxing and up to par and will hopefully make up for the getaway we’ve been trying to have since August."
128,Dmscorpio83,"September 26, 2019",1,"Worst customer service EVER!! 2nd time using this service they claimed there was a technical issue with my account. After five days of not hearing back from a supervisor they sent me an email which claimed that I have a criminal history which I don’t. They don’t obtain social security numbers so I’m not sure why I get something from them about the fair credit reporting act. Then, the very next day after my husband had to create an account for our trip which we used and got the best review a few days prior, they terminated his account for violation of policy! All he did was book a rental, gave a really good review for the host and we got the best review ever back from the host themselves. The customer service in India is the WORST! No one ever calls you back and they give some BS excuse. VRBO has been around since 1995, so there are other options around besides this awful incompetent “company”. I’d be embarrassed to work for Airbnb. Think wisely before booking or hosting. Zero stars. Look at their Facebook first and decide for yourself."

Please keep in mind that i'm software engineer with 14+years experience and things like phishing/hijacking and etc. is impossible to do with me, so someone just took a photo fo my CC or something like this. So, i'm charged from Bank and transaction is already was done, I sent message to Airbnb and guess what they did? ) - Nothing ) 3 times i sent message and each time they are answering me - Please contact your Bank. That's all - no explanation, no detailed message, no sorry, no refund. I contacted to my Bank and they sent me screenshot of transaction, it's already done, so they are unable to make chargeback process, in this case responsible is only AIRBNB but they don't care, they are sending me message once in a week and just copy paste - please contact your bank.

We went for the Lollapalooza festival and being from Colorado, had absolutely no clue of what Chicago was like. We were really happy to find an app that could give us access to such CHEAP housing for a trip that could’ve cost us five times as much as what we paid! We’re both college students still saving for our education and would’ve never been able to do this trip without AirBnb. I recommend this app to anyone and everyone who wants to explore the world!

Get a taste of the neighborhood your visiting, if you need multiple bedrooms and a kitchen then airbnb is a great value! I was double charged once by the app which could have been a serious problem but lickily I had the extra money in my acct. they estimated the return would take a few days but it actually went back in a few hours. One thing I wish the company would adjust would be when youre searching for a place to stay, there is a price listed in the main search but when you click on the place, the prices sometimes change. I also wish that the host had limits at how much they could raise their prime rate over their base rate. For a holiday for example, some places quadruple the price.. i think thats a little crazy depending on location/time of year."
133,Merr1971,"December 30, 2018",3,Easy to use but always has bugs The app has really good UI / UX but it ALWAYS has bugs. Anything minor from a booking comes in and randomly you don’t get email confirm or more major like when you add a cohost to one property and can then see all your others....... even the ones you cohost for. That includes phone numbers and personal details of guests. I reported it 3 times nothing happened he can still se everything even after he’s been removed from that one property and has no properties on his account! What gets me is they didn’t see how it was important. Their clients data had been breached........ for that reason and until they fix it giving something that should be 5 star a 2 star for their lack of QA and any follow through on a big bug like this one. If you want me to be your QA I’ll happily accept salary until then get the people who get paid to do it to do better.

135,orange3232,"May 20, 2019",1,Cancellation policy is ridiculous! The app is ok but this is about their strict cancellation policy. I have used Airbnb a few times but this is the first time I had to cancel. I am still over a month out from the 3 nights we were suppose to stay. We had some family problems that arised so we had to cancel our trip. Go into the app to cancel and it says there is a strict cancellation policy which will be over 300 dollars that they will keep. Are you serious? So I paid pretty much 2 out of the 3 nights which  we won’t stay there plus a service fee. That is ridiculous. Who gets that money for doing nothing???? Now they can open that house up to book plus have my money. Why would anyone ever make a reservation with this place months in advance. Things come up all the time! I will never use the greedy Airbnb ever again! By the way we had other places to stay booked with this trip from another company and guess what I got alot bigger refund by far more than this place. Ridiculous!
136,Longing for Florence,"September 29, 2019",5,"More Than Expected If you want to know more about Florence than what’s on the internet or printed in the city guidebooks, Sabrina and Luciano are an excellent couple to meet. I thought my knowledge about the city was good because I used to live in Florence and had returned over the years for lengthy visits. There’s still much to learn, and Sabrina and Luciano are ideal to talk to about the city’s history, its present, and its nuances. They even shared with me the names of their favorite restaurants and the best locations to go to for astounding vistas of the city. Their enthusiasm for life in Florence is heartfelt. The icing on this cake? Their delightful selection of both store-bought and homemade small bites to keep your appetite satisfied. The experience with Sabrina and Luciano is the ideal way to begin a vacation in beautiful Florence. I highly recommend them!"
137,bethanybb1234,"July 6, 2019",5,Such incredible customer service I had a trip planned for NYC and the host cancelled at 9 pm the night before arrival due to “an emergency in the apartment”. I called Airbnb in a panic thinking I’d be homeless in NYC trying to celebrate my 21st birthday. They not only gave me a full refund on my trip they helped cover the new place since I wouldn’t have the refund to cover it for 5-10 business days and I am a college student on a tight budget. All I can say is I am so grateful for Airbnb and their amazing customer service support team for making my birthday trip possible once more. You all (and especially Jade!!) were incredible and I can’t say enough good things. If you’re worried about the risk of an Airbnb cancelling on you-know Airbnb will go above and beyond to make things right. Thank you all!!!

139,Jobott,"September 28, 2019",1,"Such a good idea, wish a better company thought of it Be careful and have a backup plan!!! They cancelled my reservation a week before my trip to Denver with a note saying let us know if we can help in any way. I said I could use help getting a new place to stay that’s not 200+ more a night than my original listing. They sent me one place with half the amount of beds and told me to send links to other places I would consider. I sent in links and got no response. I have been sending message after message explaining the original agent on the case is not responding. The response I get from that is that they are sending my case back to the agent that is not doing anything so he can deal with it. What kind of business cancels on a customer and then ghosts them after offering help? I can not express to you enough how important a back up plan is. List two places and cancel one a few days before.... it’s the only way to guarantee you don’t end up in my situation."
140,V'licious,"January 2, 2018",1,"Horrible Customer Service Before you use Airbnb, know that you cannot contact their customer service if you have an issue. They can only contact you. My host canceled out on me at the last minute. I wanted to check in at 11am, but she told me to check in at 5pm. She canceled at 4pm, while on my way to hers. When you cancel on a host, you pay for the inconvenience. When a host cancels on you, Airbnb only offers you either your full refund, or an additional 10% of your fees if you choose to book another rental with Airbnb, even if it’s more expensive. All other options were more expensive at that time of day, and when they called me, they told me I had to wait for Shannon, who was my case manager, to get to work, even though I was stuck with nowhere to go in -2 degrees cold. I asked to speak with another case manager and was put on hold for 20mins. I sent another request to be called, and its been 24hours, no one has called back or emailed.

141,TGorm,"August 5, 2018",4,"Some difficulty but overall positive ! Airbnb overall has been a very positive and successful tool in renting our home however some renters how a multitude of questions and there phone numbers are deleted from initial conversations. We understand that Airbnb wants to keep conversations within the system however sometimes this frustrates prospective renters trying to make choices quickly. Also, when communicating with renters who have booked, attachments have not been able to be sent through your system. We have a two page Welcome Package set up specifically for each renter with all the codes, directions and tips for them and we have not been able to include this on your website. Lastly, I have had to purchase a laptop computer as Airbnb doesn't seem compatible with iPad's."
142,JG5ME,"August 9, 2018",3,"So far, so....? For the most part Air BnB has been great, an easy platform to use and connect with guests to rent my home. My only issue is that their “great host protection” is kind of a joke. I had a guest ruin several expensive items in my home (a carpet and mattress) and I submitted photos and receipts within 12 hours of the guests departure for the replacements, which, due to the type of damage, had to be immediately replaced. It took nearly a month, of cycling through multiple people in Air’s resolution center, multiple messages, re-submission of photos and receipts and more messages out of my frustration and the result was Air telling me I needed a cleaning estimate for items I no longer had! The final ruling was they reimbursed me $155 on a $580 unexpected bill because I didn’t get a cleaning estimate. I rent my house to make extra money, not spend more. Big thumbs down for that portion."
143,Jqdang,"February 14, 2019",1,"Airbnb left me high and dry. Its a good experience when thing go right, but when things go wrong, it really goes wrong. Expect that customer service cannot help you. Expect customer service to reassure you that thing will be able to be resolved. Then hours  later They have no power to authorize anything. They will always side with the property owner even when they are wrong. And finally when they have you in a corner, they will charge you again for airbnb service charge. To what service I'm still not sure."
144,Stefanie09,"February 15, 2019",3,"Good overall but one major flaw I’ve enjoyed the Airbnb app and haven’t had any problems until now. I’m currently in Japan and I can’t read Japanese. When you message your host you can choose to translate the conversation but every time you exit the inbox and re-enter it you have to retranslate the conversation. Which doesn’t sound like a problem until you’re driving around, lost in the dark and the rain and you have to constantly exit the inbox to get it to refresh. And then you have to wait those precious seconds waiting for the inbox to refresh AND pressing the translate button while potentially missing a turn as you’re host gives you directions. Obviously this is a very specific problem to have but if they have the capability of translating the conversation in the first place they should be able to keep it translated."
145,Honeymoon gone wrong,"March 15, 2019",1,Be careful and take pictures of everything before and after you leave My wife and I went on a honeymoon to Hawaii and decided to stay in an Airbnb. The place was great aside from the bed was very uncomfortable and we barley slept. They sent us an email at the end of our stay asking we do not leave a bad review rather tell them if we had any issues. We wanted people to know that we didn’t sleep well. They said we left the place very clean. However days after we left a review stating the bed was uncomfortable we receive a notice saying we broke blinds and tried sticking they back up with paper clips and tapes and stained a bunch of sheets which looked to be bleach. We were accused of damages we did not do. Even though we fought it and asked to have someone from Airbnb call us they denied calling us and just charged us. I’m beyond upset for being blamed for damages we did not cause. I’m even more upset they didn’t have the decency to give us a call back to talk to us. Crooked.
146,Rysodone,"July 29, 2019",1,"SuperHost/Guest As a 2 year Superhost I am extremely disappointed with my experience with Airbnb! I am cute in tears now and very hurt and distraught because I’ve been in the phone with Airbnb for 2 hours calling Apple Pay, my bank, and several Airbnb case managers. I made a reservation that turned out to be fraudulent in the listing details and the host never responded. A representative assured me of a refund and then of course the host responds. Now I am out of a place to stay, my flight refund, and the initial refund of canceled reservation. I have had no help with. The case manager, HERBERD, I am on hold with currently is ONLY concerned with recovering a loss with Airbnb, so much so that he lied and stated that a merchant is my bank, when we all know that is the person I made the transition with. Airbnb please update your information and the knowledge of you representatives because you are ruining ppls livelihood, it has happened to my guests and now me. I am very very disappointed. I will be going to VRBO to see what they offer."
147,johnnym16823,"June 10, 2019",1,"Awful experience We recently booked a little mini vacation to Vegas and booked an Airbnb because it’s usually more convenient than a hotel. upon arriving to the Airbnb we were greeted with dirty dishes all over the sink, unmade beds, open Food in the fridge, and a clogged bathroom sink with hair on it. about 15 minutes after we got there another family walked through the door and proceeded to tell us that they had booked the same place for the same day and time (very uncomfortable and awkward situation) after agreeing to leave and find somewhere else to stay, we waited in the lobby for about an hour trying to contact Support with no response. After about a week Support finally got back to me about issuing a refund. we figured the least they can do would be to provide us with a discount or possibly even cover our next Airbnb stay but they refused to do anything else besides issue a refund. Definitely expected more from such a large we’ll known company. Never again."

The most disgusting condo I have ever seen. The odor and blankets stunk so bad. Jay said not to leave a review and he would refund me the money as we did not stay a single night in his filthy place. Spoiler alert: Jay never refunded us, contacted Airbnb and sent them pictures of his nasty place and they gave us 145 dollars.....not 758 dollars that we spent on this stupid place. First and last time I will ever use Airbnb. Everyone I talk to and show pictures too say they will never stay at an Airbnb either now. Customer service is a huge part of a business and Airbnb clearly don’t care about the quality of the rooms they allow on their app. Don’t trust the deceitful pictures because my pictures are polar opposite of the listings. You couldn’t pay me to sleep in some sketchy condo like Jay and Robins."

We had such an enjoyable day today with Sergio, our very knowledgeable friendly host who took us around the city and explained the amazing background of this very old city. He can speak many different languages so fluently so that French speaking visitors and English speaking visitors in our group learned so much and could ask him questions. He was so kind to take a group photo and some individual photos and send them to us along with recommendations for different restaurants to try. We enjoyed our stop at a small restaurant to sample port wine and pastries. We highly recommend this excellent and very reasonable tour with Sergio."

Just when you get used to where certain functions are, they move! I end up spending way too much time trying to find things. Case in point: directions to the listing.

Than I booked a location I feel you can’t go off of peoples review because everyone said this place was great. When I got to the location I already noticed mold on the ceiling and it was right above the bed. A few nights later the roof collapsed in where the mold was. The homeowners were responsive but they probably should of go that fixed before trying to book people for a health risk. And I feel in all the pictures they took they angled it perfectly just to so you won’t see it. Also the place was infested with a couple of families of roaches. I’m still in the process of finding a new place. Airbnb sounds like a great App but just for the headache and price it’s a lot more convenient to stay at a known hotel surprisingly the price is not that far off. I just recommend to do your research and contact the homeowner to see if the location has any issues,"
153,jdonther,"September 24, 2018",2,"Unfair review system Airbnb isn’t bad for finding a place to stay, but their policy on reviews needs work. I was accused by a host of stealing something in their review of my stay which I did not take. Through further exchanges they did not provide any evidence as to why they thought I stole something and said “sorry to blame you”, but also declined to remove or alter the review. After 48 hours it becomes permanent. Upon contacting Airbnb support about it they said it didn’t violate their rules so they would have to leave it up. Their claim is they want to be about trust and transparency. So the first thing any future potential host will see about me is “he stole something”. They will have to open the review to actually see my response, and even if they see that it’s still their word against mine. Update your policy so that if claims like this are made they actually have to give some evidence since they reviews are so permanent."

They said they would have someone email me. Days later.... still nothing. A week goes by and I call back again. This time, asking to speak to someone via the phone. Apparently they won’t allow it, but they assured I’d be placed at “top priority”. TWO MORE WEEKS go by, and I still have not heard a thing. My bank account was refunded the amount I spent on booking the place, which means that I now do not have a place because the people couldn’t get back to me. Called again. Nothing has changed. No answers. That is absolutely the worst customer service I’ve ever dealt with in my life. How do you not even send one email in weeks!? I’ve used the app before, but will not be doing it again.

Description stated lockbox for the keys. No lockbox walked in with open door keys on the counter. That was uncomfortable not knowing if someone had been inside. 2nd there was hair on the bath shower floor mat. Airbnb claimed it could have been corrected by the host. I said no way why would I want to sleep on that bed. Asked if they could reimburse me and they claimed they can’t. I asked  the supervisor if she would stay and she said no. Even then she would not reimburse me. Terrible, definitely worth spending the same amount a cheaper hotel. When Airbnb does not have you back when they host the name and site for the host to post their places. At this point it feels like a scam and nothing they can do. I suffered the cost of the night, cleaning fee and service fee when I didn’t spend more then 15 min in the place before leaving. Don’t recommend it, stay away."

157,Ram0177,"February 7, 2020",3,"Good application horrible support App is good and easy to use. However couple of glitches 1) be cautious when you enter your official email and is also a frequent traveler because you may not be able to delete the office email from the preferences and you’ll get zero support from their support team. They don’t want you to do this. Again by entering office email you get zero benefits too. All marketing gimmicks. The pain is, you’ll have to wait until the final stay is over (until your final booking) to remove the office email from the account, which is rather annoying and bothersome with all marketing stuff arriving frequently. 2) Another thing is there is no easy way to get the address of the location. It should be clear and visible in the main page when you complete your purchase. Hopefully they’ll correct this."

I’d often heard the rumors about Airbnb for years about how they just care about the money and don’t care about the safety or wellbeing of their customers. Unfortunately I felt that first hand yesterday. I told a host that his toilet seat was broken, his bedroom window didn’t close (in London) to make him aware of it and thought it better than telling him as soon as I was aware rather than when I left. He accused me of doing it and threatened me, said he was going to come to the house (a woman on my own). He became nasty when I told him I didn’t feel comfortable letting a man in while I was alone. I then got a knock on the door, I knew I had to get out of there ASAP! I contacted Airbnb 3 times in 24 hours. I’m yet to get a phone call from them. I received a text asking if I had stayed at the house, nothing more. Absolutely disgusted! I will be staying at hotels again from now on. I believe the stories about Airbnb now.

In the biography of the apartment we rented, it stated that there would be no other people staying there and that the host would NOT be there. Which is why I chose that place. When we arrived our host was not only late but then when he showed up he did NOT formally introduce himself nor show us the apartment. We had walked in and there he was just doing work like he was staying there. We then soon realized that indeed he was staying there. He did so without mentioning it al all. He was there the entire 9 days & was very disturbing to the peace that I wanted. And then when the stay was over 3 weeks later the host has the nerve to charge 1400$ for so calls damage? Damage?

Being able to book a whole house is so much nicer and less costly than a hotel room!! Finding the right option in the right location has been much easier than expected. The booking is super easy. All of the owners have been responsive and gracious. While not all places have been exactly my taste in decor they’ve been as advertised. The only time I had a surprise it was my own fault of rushing to book at the last minute and not reading the info correctly. It was smaller than expected but in great new, clean shape.

Staying in these places is way better than a hotel! Hosts have been wonderful and we’ve enjoyed home away from home.  Most recently, my daughter, grandsons, fur babies and I needed to evacuate the area for Hurricane Florence. I was thrilled to be able to find places to stay and the hosts were very accommodating.  I did hear of some free places offered to evacuees, but I didn’t find that to be the case.  I’m just happy my family and I had some place to go.

Seriously, an email? No common courtesy to call me about something like that. I had 4 children with me with no place to go when we arrive. I reached out to the number that was included with the automated cancellation email to speak with a real person about the situation.

I understand things can go wrong while renting an Airbnb... but dealing with it this summer has been a headache. I was so excited to stay in an Airbnb this summer, and was looking forward to a great experience but I would sadly not recommend Airbnb to anyone as of right now.

Airbnb did not ban homes in Turkish occupied Cyprus, Moroccan occupied Sahara, China occupied Tibet, or Russia Occupied South Ossetia. This is completely unacceptable.

Flash forward to 5 days before we fly out and I get an automated message from Airbnb saying our reservation has been canceled!!!! No reasoning for the cancellation or any word from the host. Thank god we got a full refund, but I will never use Airbnb again.

This can be rather misleading. I was about to reserve a stay listed at $40 but on closer examination I realized that the listing also had a $275 cleaning fee, putting the rental far out of my price range. Not to mention that there is no way to filter out locations with minimum night stays that hike the price of your visit. The has app has come a long way but these issues have been a major problem. It takes longer than necessary to book a place because you simply cannot filter out deal breaker options, which isn’t great when you’re in fix for a place to stay"

Another thing, when a guest leaves a review, the app wont allow you to  respond a comment  on their review. The only way I can do this is to go on my desktop. Also if I am reading one of my guests reviews, I try to click on the host that reviewed their profiles or listing, guest what? That also doesn't work and I also have to do that on my desktop. It’s not convenient. They are wealthy company with lots of $. I think they can afford to hire great programers rather than cheap ones.

We had left a review for a place we stayed at some good and some bad, only to see the good had been posted. The reviews are extremely important the good and the bad, and to have certain comments taken away because they hurt a houses reputation is wrong. It’s extremely unfair and misleading when trying to find a perfect house for a stay. That’s what reviews are for. So this review is to let those know who don’t know, that some reviews have removed anything that might hurt the houses chance of getting someone to stay. Anything you would want to know before selecting that house you might not be told because of this issue. Now I hope this review does not, not get posted because it’s not a good recommended review. It’s to help others be aware that their “5 star” house could actually be a lot less than a 5 star house."

I use them for work at least 3 times a week. Recently I showed up to an already booked and confirmed apartment for the week and when I got arrived, the owner answered the door and said he couldn’t let me stay because he “was sick”.  So I was then stuck with no place to stay for the next three days.  I called AirBnB support and Maria was so nice and calm.  They put me up in a great little boutique hotel right by my work in downtown St Pete.   It was a great three days and I am very impressed by how they took care of everything.  I continue using g AirBnB weekly and will do so for the foreseeable future."

191,IG: monaemodel,"March 15, 2018",4,"Great but with problems Airbnb is a great app no doubt BUT there are a few annoying things that I wish could be solved. For one, the fact that they hide phone numbers and emails through messages. I guess it’s to prevent outside transactions but as a traveling CNA who constantly looks for housing in different states on Airbnb, it’s nothing but a hassle. My company pays for my housing and they like to talk to hosts before I book so that everyone feels safe and secure with the transaction. EXCEPT Airbnb makes that impossible by blocking phone numbers until you book. Also, people come here for cheaper prices but some of the prices here are ridiculous. But that’s completely up to the host so oh well. Lastly customer support could use a huge upgrade."

Upon getting to the place late at night I found the house smelled and they had a cat on the home. I am allergic to cats and there for could not stay in the home. My cell service was poor in the area and this left me to wonder through town desperately looking for an open hotel room. I finally found an open room at one a.m. upon cancelling my Airbnb reservation and we informed that I would not received full refund because I had entered the residence and not cancelled 48 hour prior to my stay. I was informed in my denial email that if I felt this to be unfair I could contact Airbnb so after several hours of trying to navigate their extremely contour intuitive and convoluted app I found the number and called only to be told that they would not help me, not could not would not! Do not under any circumstances use Airbnb!"

I really enjoy hearing that my guests feel that this platform is so much more user friendly than the competition’s platform.  The others, they say, have hidden charges and then upon a necessary cancellation their funds are held for weeks.  Also, when there was a small computer glitch and it affected the income on a particular reservation I was able to talk with real, love humans and they graciously recognized the error was in the computer platform and they deposited the disputed funds into my account quickly.  I am very happy and proud to be part of the Airbnb community! Thanks for all you do."

I have been renting my properties on vrbo for 10 years never had any trouble with getting paid cause vrbo charges the guests as soon as booking is made, Airbnb charges after the guest have moved in so the guests can just cancel the credit card and live for free! All Airbnb can do is keep calling them. This happened to me. The refundable deposit is a joke, the guest is never actually charged the amount, if the host files a claim Airbnb will then evaluate and charge the guests credit card, well good luck with that! Guests can post any negative reviews, Airbnb does not asks for any proof, no pictures nothing, guests can write whatever they want. "

If me using your service was an issue because of my record THAN YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT BEFORE YOU TOOK MY MONEY. Here's the best part. They told me it can take up to 15 business days for me to get my money back. I DONT HAVE MONEY LAYING AROUND TO JUST BOOK SOMETHING ELSE ON SHORT NOTICE. As of right now you have successfully ruined my trip and caused me to put nearly 1k in flight fairs at risk. You need to either figure out how to have the funds back in my account NOW regardless of my banks policies as YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN MY MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THIS IS YOUR FAULT or you need to fix my reservation NOW.

After try time and time again I finally got with someone who would reply to me and it still took him a week to get my money back to me AND he treated me like I was stupid and didn’t understand anything. AND the only way I got my money back was because the host agreed to it. Airbnb’s policy was overly strict about the situation and just assumed people would be traveling again within a month. They don’t care about the customers, only the most they can make off of them. I’ll never use this god awful business again. VRBO just got a new costumer"

The search by location feature doesn’t seem to work right though, as you’ll only see a handful on the map even when the full list has many more. Also it would be nice to be able to eliminate certain homes from the list of results after you’ve reviewed them.  Right now, the issue is that all of a sudden you can’t login, you just get the A symbol while it loads but nothing happens. this is on an ipad. I tried to submit this issue through the help center, but you can’t put in help requests if you are not logged in, which is ironic if the issue is that you can’t log in."

Keep in mind if I had cancelled within 30 days I would have had to pay the full amount but the host can cancel anytime even the day before you arrive with no penalty.  Also - once you are cancelled you cannot write a review of that host.  This has happened to several people I know and was the reason I was hesitant to use Airbnb - they have horrible service experiences and don’t care about anybody using their services.  We were traveling for an event and places are all booked so we are abandoned completely.  We will stick with hotels and we recommend you never use this service."

My most recent, a private home in Cozumel, had a sizable error in the cost of my rental, not in my favor. It took a bit of time (communication over several weeks) and I had to stay on top of the issue with the support team, but it was solved and I ended up paying the correct price. The support team was really great and always I felt valued and appreciated. I think they must be well trained, both technically and customer service wise. For me, this is a sign of a well run company and one that I will continue to use."
204,BuonRotto,"September 4, 2018",1,"Scam This is a one star review for the company’s policies, not its app. Yeah, I’m that guy. We booked a home for my sister-in-law’s wedding months in advance, only for the owner to cancel our reservation when it was apparent that they could charge others twice as much. To add insult to injury, after we were dropped by the owner, we get ads on Instagram for the very same home for rent for twice as much money. To be fair, Airbnb is going to penalize the owner, but we cannot leave a negative review because we never actually got to set foot in the home. It’s basic breach of contract but this is the sharing economy where your state attorney general and the BBB have no recourse. So it is basically ok to do this if you can withstand a small slap on the wrist. This is a crime just waiting to happen for anyone foolish enough to try it. We were foolish ourselves. We learned the hard way. Maybe you’ll think twice before risking important plans."

And I was also very worried because my family and I didn’t have a place to stay. I called Airbnb customer service and was surprised I was even able to speak to a live agent.

208,jgraybird,"August 31, 2019",1,Airbnb customer service is a SCAM! We booked a Airbnb in Austin and it ended up being a scam account! And the owners of the legitimate place said that Airbnb knew someone was running a scam with their address and was supposed to contact the people who had booked through them. When we contacted Airbnb they were no help. Our first case manager TIAGO told us to contact available Airbnb’s in the area and he would watch the conversations from his side. After we did that he CLOCKED OUT! We didn’t know no one was working our case until we called back. Then once we had gotten a second case manager they offered us a place that is worth less and didn’t have enough available beds. This customer service is a true nightmare you better hope that nothing ever goes wrong with your service bc they will not help you at all. They left us sitting in the Austin summer heat for hours with no help.

However it’s just become a room listing place with ever increasing rates and fees that hotels are becoming better deals! The quality of places, owners, and especially the quality and pricing of rooms has become terrible. Prices for garbage places match or supersede much more quality places or even hotels. The b.s. rules of all these listers as well as all the fees have made Airbnb a non-starter, it’s such a hassle and at the end of the day you’re not really a guest on vacation at most places, you’re walking on eggshells trying to act proper on a holiday. Idk how the quality dipped so much, how the prices have spiked globally, and why it’s such a headache to sift through trashy places or fee riddled or tourist tax places."

I will never be able to thank them enough for offering such an amazing place for her to stay for such an amazing price but most importantly, I will never forget what amazing people they are!!

I just tried to cancel a reservation by using their in-app instructions on how to cancel, but mysteriously there was no cancel button. A customer support agent offered to cancel it on his end....as if I had any other option. He specifically asked if I was ok with only getting back half of what i paid, again, as if there was another option. He goes through the whole process. After the trip is cancelled, I ask ‘so how does the refund work?’ To which he responds that because there is still a balance (I have paid over $300 already) they won’t be refunding ANY of the money. This is the second time they have tried to pull some bs and not give a refund. Very disappointed. That’s just bad business."

All the hotels have free room service because you already pay for that in the room price ,only they charge a cleaning fee if you make a mess or smoke but you can’t charge cleaning fee with no reason in the front,my point is why BNB let to the owners put that cleaning fee too high if they already are charging the room,is like if Uber or Lyft charge with every ride a cleaning fee lol ,every ride is plus 10 bucks because you for sure let garbage in my car right?

If you want to cancel now you will have to pay a long term cancellation fee. As a customer it is very disappointing that customer service did nothing to help me in this and could not even offer a discount although they had said they would look for alternative housing only to do nothing.

I called Airbnb assuming it must be a mistake. They told me that it was technically allowed, but they would call the host and get her to lower the cost. They never did call her or call me back. It was too late to cancel my reservation, so we had to stay here in an uncomfortable position, and literally paying more than an extra night in cash on order to get a key.

Can aAirbnb truly inspect and ensure that submitted photos of each and every place are current? I have photos in my phone that prove they don’t. Twice I booked rooms in S.C. that were completely contrary to what was advertised: they had cats, were near noisy freeways, and one kept the thermostat at 76f in the summer. All of this I documented in the Airbnb app. Add to that their requirement of photos of your ID, yet they cannot accept digital images above a minimal KB size, which they don't disclose until after you take and try to submit; and then they debit your account before they verify your identity and book!

Send a message to companies like this that support lying, untruthful property owners over the customers that provide the revenue the rely upon to exist. Horrible, unconscionable, and untruthful.  You will never see a single dime from me, or the people I encounter that I converse with.  I will make it my mission to spread the truth about your horrible policies that are 100% skewed in favor of property owners.  Buyer Beware."

I got a notification from the lister the next day that the price was incorrect and that she wanted to charge me 3x the price!  I immediately called Airbnb and the gentleman that I spoke to said that the lister had to honor the price.  Six months later, in October, the lister again reached out and cancelled my reservation, which Airbnb had assured me they could not do.  I was distraught so I called Airbnb and was told that they instituted a $100 penalty on the lister...$100!  She was trying to extort $24,000 from me!  Why would she even flinch at $100.  I’m now looking for a place 6 months later with nothing available and Airbnb is doing nothing.  I was told a supervisor would call me back...I have heard nothing.  They need to be accountable to fix this!"

As a host the website and app is hard to use, even after they just revamped it. It was even worse before. Customer service and resolutions is where they are truly lacking.

After my listing was canceled, they were supposed to send me a discount coupon, they did not.  They then led me to believe they would pay for my hotel, and they reneged on that offer.

The app used to be my go to for places to stay. I’ve booked over 15 stays. The closest thing to breakfast was a cup of coffee a host made me. The price you see is not the price you pay. Most of the time its double that! The host are getting greedy with their ridiculous cleaning fee. A $60 cleaning fee for a $30 a night stay and the bed is an air mattress. most host don’t even change the linens.  I’ve found 3-4 star hotels for cheaper than that with full breakfast and no cleaning fees. I’ve not booked with Airbnb since March and I travel frequently.

260,ArnieBee,"November 1, 2017",1,Search option needs updating This app is great in some ways and horrible in others. For instance I am trying to search for tiny homes and the search box is apparently only for locations. I want to search all over the world for tiny houses. I don't want to have to type specific locations and then thumb through all the results to find the type of accommodation I'm looking for. It's a simple thing to be able to do and I don't know why it's not possible on this app or their website. Frustrating. Also the app told me my host left a review about me and I have no idea where to find that. I'm not an idiot and I can usually figure things out and I tried and tried to find these things without luck. Please fix this app and website because I love the service it offers but hate the search option.

I know of motels that are def not as safe or friendly nearby that still charge more than I ever would. so I guess what I’m trying to say is that sometimes ppl can go hard on you. Outside of that, it’s a really cool and fun experience that can also be creative.  I enjoy prepping the room with Decor and coming up w different ways for them to have a more charmed experience.  :)"

I don’t want to reject their inquiry outright because it not being salt water was not a deal breaker.

That’s all the vacation money I had saved up! I can’t change my days because my PTO has already been approved and there’s no flexibility. Now I have no money to book a hotel because AirBnB isn’t giving me my money back. I will now be spending my first vacation in two years on my couch.

It is unfortunate that the the web site platform and rules change frequently, for example cancellation policies. The managers do not trust their users to share direct contact info until after booking making conversation more burdensome than need be.  The various functions available on the web site are more difficult to access than other booking platforms.  The quality of customer service once you find it can be uneven, sometimes very good and other times barely adequate.  The user base on this platform is uneven as well for both guests and hosts but has improved greatly over the past 10 years."

The host cancelled at the last second and Airbnb promised us a new room free of charge at a similar value and then booked us a room that was actually double-booked and we found that out at the airport before our flight. Airbnb did not offer to pay for a hotel room or anything, just money back and we had to book a hotel room last second at a rate that was higher than Airbnb's. Moral of the story is that you can't depend on your Airbnb staying available or having a safe second option, be prepared for the worst."

I canceled according to the whole Covid 19 stipulations and here a week later have had no response from either party. Spend your money elsewhere with a reputable company. I will definitely be discouraging every person that I know from using the service.

The experience in being refunded for this awful experience has been a nuisance, and dragged on now for over a month. I thought AirBnB support might have the muscle to get the hosts to own up to and solve THEIR mistake, but it has only slowed the process. At some point someone has to be responsible for the guests. It may be my first bad experience, but it’s the big one that really tests if this company is capable of rivaling the professionalism of others in its industry, and I have been terribly disappointed."

That’s fine to except when you try to take photo of ID to upload it sends you to a blank white screen and stays there.

Resolving issues with Airbnb can take months on end. You get bookings of random people that come to your house for a few nights, party, steal things from your house, they break things in your house they leave your house trashed. AIRBNB claims to have your back on situations like that, however, I can tell you from personal experience and having hosted over 100 people, that when you reach out to AIRBNB and let them know that somebody had stolen an item from your house or broken a window in your house or booked a room for one person but actually brought in to people and a dog they make it impossible for you to recuperate your money.

I reported it to air bnb but they just blocked our chat instead of doing something actually helpful. So this person, who is aggressive and deceitful, is still posting fake ads on air bnb (Hong Kong) and Air BNB didn’t do anything about this.

So the most you pay the most you lose. Some people add extra charges after you already pay, they will take your money and accept your reservation and then will ask for more money for extra fees never mention in the description or agreement.

There is virtually no system in place to prevent you from getting stood up by an unresponsive host, as was the case with me. And if you should be unlucky enough to be visiting a place where accommodations are in high demand, you’ll likely have to book a place last minute that is way more expensive, and the best Air BnB will do for you is refund you plus an inconsequential inconvenience payout. The support staff is disorganized at best, negligent at worst.

I am appalled by the hosts as well as AirBnB support and even though I was eventually able to obtain a full cash refund the process was so painstaking that I will never use or recommend AirBnB to anyone again."

We are in close proximity to Death Valley, and the people coming through are on vacation; and mostly from Europe. We have seen over 60 people come through our home and we haven’t had a bad one yet. The review process works well, the guest reviews us, and we review the guests after they have left. This weeds out people that you don’t want in your home. I love doing this, we have met just some great people.  Highly recommend it."

I can always find something more comfortable and affordable than hotels, usually with our own kitchen to save on food expenses and better manage our diets. The variety is always amazing and each place bears the unique character of the owner and local culture. We can have independence, or find places with super hosts to be our local informants!"

Often the inbox does not update for a day. Every time we have a guest who checks in on day-light savings day, the app actually changes our check in time to one hour earlier (not sure how this is a bug but it needs to be fixed). Twice we have had issues with guests who we allowed to leave their bags until check out, having problems crossing paths with the incoming guests. I get text messages when there is a message from the guest which I used to be able to reply to, now I have to go into the app which is extremely slow. The app needs a lot of work."

It takes a bit to understand how the texting works and understanding exactly where the places are is difficult until after you actually book it. I want to know exactly where they are located BEFORE I book it but you have to read carefully, look at pictures provided and that helps pin point better where it is. Will keep using it as long as we are happy and right now, we are, but it takes some research on your part and comparing of amenities and location and price."

We lost the place to another group and now are without a place. Airbnb customer service was terrible, they did little to nothing to rectify the situation. Offering a simple coupon as if that would provide the solution to our problem. Also we wanted was our reservation to be honored. It’s honestly not worth the hassle.

Long time hosts have been saying how Airbnb has an obvious bias for guests return business to their platform than upholding the contracted rights & standards of the Host.  Airbnb has shown their willingness to act unilaterally against the interest of hosts with this Covid crisis.  And to continue the insult & scams, Airbnb then prompts guests who are not eligible for a refund to request one anyway from the Host informing the guest a host “May chose to issue a full refund”; effectively setting up the host for a fight with a guest that now expects an unqualified refund.  This is just the latest in a long history of bad corporate actions by Airbnb against their partner Hosts.  Now is the time for a major competitor to step in and offer a platform that providers real substantial teeth that protect hosts.

DO NOT BOOK here avoid this Scam they benefit from people!!!! Find another website where your money is secured and they are responsible of your booking.  Also the hosts can change any charges at the last moment just be AWARE OF THEIR SCAM. So sad because they used to have the best apps in booking houses and apts. Do yourself a favor a book your vacation somewhere else where your money is safe and your family. I had the worst experience ever!!!!

Somehow once Airbnb is involved, they cannot take back their taxes or cut of the service fee for  missed days for a refund.

Both of the host cancelled when we arrived and messaged the hosts to get the keys. The case manager who talked to us stated that both places shouldn’t have been posted, because they weren’t available for those dates. Then the case manager we talked to even went as far as to send us a link to a place that was supposed to be available, only after giving us the runaround for 30 mins. Then we book the place off of the link, and that place (which is another 20 min drive from where we are) is also unavailable after we booked it.

Well it turns out, if you have a misdemeanor they will cancel your account a week before your trip and anyone you are friends with. They told her it was because of her criminal record (she doesn’t have a felony), and then they cancelled mine because I tried to rent the same place once they cancelled hers. It’s pretty bs for anyone to do something like that to people. Thankfully there are so many other sites to use, and we were able to get a place booked that was cheaper and better than the place we originally had through Airbnb.

I asked multiple times to speak to a supervisor just to have the representative stop responding to me all together. Had to call again the next day and still nothing from a supervisor. Only offer I was given was a $200 coupon still leaving me with a $400 extra cost to book the same trip. Will not be using Airbnb in the future.

I am canceling 20 days before and they are saying I had to cancel 48 hrs after in order to get a full refund. I asked him to explain to me why he said “or 14 full days prior to check in” and now he’s telling me something else and I never received a response back.

I have been very fortunate to find excellent locations at reasonable rates, and hosts in major cities and small towns, to include popular tourist areas. Literally every host has been amazing for me. However, since Fall of 2018, the rates for rentals across the USA has skyrocketed, along with exorbitant cleaning fees, service fees, local fees. I’m now consistently pricing resorts in the same fee range as Air BNB rentals. Nice hotels are now more economical than Air BNB. The concept behind this operation was to offer something nice but at less cost than the standard big chain business oriented hotels. So, see ya later hosts. I know you don’t care about one person. A $150+ cleaning fee is outrageous. Your condo/house/loft/bunglaow isn’t that amazing."

Unfortunately the bad experiences have outweighed the good and we are considering staying in hotels in future with the exception of renting a whole home to stay with friends and family.

They did not notify me to provide notice. Rather, as I tried to schedule a last minute trip, I was informed I would not be able to do so without completing their verification procedure, which included taking pictures directly through their app on my phone.

It was clean and appointed with everything we needed.  Bathroom was small but very clean and well supplied.  Kitchen was equipped with coffee pot, toaster and hot plate. We loved the special touch of a loaf of heart-shaped sourdough bread, butter and some champagne.  Refrigerator was also stocked with simple breakfast needs such as milk, yogurt bananas and oranges.  Bed was very comfortable. "
346,SendingOutAnSOS,"May 5, 2019",1,Airbnb is spying! In the past I’ve had mostly great experiences with Airbnb but something has given me a major pause with both Airbnb and Apple. Yesterday I was running Safari searches on my MacBook for activities and restaurants in Miami for a friend. Then this morning I received a notification on my iPhone from the Airbnb app that I should finish booking my Miami trip with their app! I NEVER have done any inquiries on their website or app regarding Miami. This means that Apple and Airbnb are obviously colluding in not respecting the privacy of its customers. Guess what? I’m deleting the Airbnb app from all of my devices and may not use them going forward. Apple continues to disappoint and affirm my recent feelings that they blatantly lie and disrespect their customers unlike years past. Very disappointing.

We put a large downpayment on a place only to figure out that the cabin would no longer work for us. We contacted the owner of the cabin who said she was more than happy to refund the money because we were so far out from the rental date. AirBnB, however, refuses to return the downpayment to us which, by the way, the owner hasn’t seen a dime of either. We are still dealing with this ongoing issue that AirBnB customer service has been no help in. "

It’s so hard to find the checkin information on my reservations - which is something I have to do every time I make a reservation. They have an algorithm that clearly blocks certain places for certain users when you’re searching for a home... not sure how that’s determined.

I often find cancelling a place to be a hassle and you are often left at the whim of the Host. Airbnb should institute a no hassle cancellation policy with your many back on your card within 3 days. Airbnb should never give deposit or advance funds to the Host but rather put the money in Escrow. Airbnb should be the one dealing with the cancellation 100%. If you are within the cancellation period, it should be simple done and done. With a hotel reservation - directly with a hotel - as long as you cancel within the number of days designated, you know you will not be charged or will get your money back."

For example if the request is Aug 10 to Aug 15 and all the totals are calculated but the guest says they have 3 cats, in that case it would be wonderful to be able to adjust the cleaning fee right then privately or add a pet cleaning fee section.

406,Dragoncx,"April 4, 2019",1,Airbnb The guests is good to be a guest a host not so much guests can be a pain especially the one nighters they should not have such a privilege of writing things that are not true especially in America. I don’t think you should get paused just because guests gave the host a 2-3 stars. When you have many 4-5 stars. The host is paying airbnb for service shouldn’t matter. There paying for a service your should not get paused just because these people expect hotel perfection. This is someone’s home. Even hotels get 1-2-3 stars and still get there rooms filled up with bad ratings and charge less doesn’t matter people still rent them. So if the host is paying every time they get a guest there place should not get paused for paying for a service......

The host was unaware why I would not have received a full refund and suggested I contact AirBNB. I did. They sent me a link to terms explaining why they did not refund certain fees. Even now, when I look for these terms in the app, I cannot find them. These terms should be obvious during the reservation and cancellation process. Also, given that I ended up rebooking the exact same reservation, out of the desire to create a positive customer experience, AirBNB should have just refunded the money. I have booked with them several times and I have had nothing but positive reviews as a guest."

They did find another place and ended of covering the difference of 100$ or so but the options I had to choose from did not compare. The place I ended up staying at smelled molded and sheets and furniture sprayed with disinfectant spray (face started breaking out night 2). The handle in bathroom was broke and my 2 year pulled the handle and it flew off hitting her in the face leaving her with a small cut above here eye.

Guests can stay for weeks and Airbnb can choose to refund them and take money out of your account with no say from you.  They are a big company now, so you will never talk to the same person twice and they couldn’t care less about your property or concerns.  Not to mention their fees for guests are incredibly high.  Tons of work managing guests, who many treat your home like a hotel.  If you doubt this review, I highly recommend you try contacting Airbnb on the phone before you join, just to be clear on what you are getting yourself into with them before you’re stuck.  Best of luck!"

We have loved using Airbnb to travel and have unique experiences everywhere we go. I highly recommend this app and service. They make it extremely simple to communicate and book places very fast.

419,Medoizer,"December 13, 2019",1,"Useless This app and website are ridiculous. The prices that show up in the search listing are completely false. For example, a listing claiming $55 a night may only one have night a month listed at that price meanwhile all the other days are 3x as much. Listings can require two, three or more nights to reserve on top of outrageous cleaning fees! So if you reserve one night at $55 you then have to reserve two or more additional days at the higher prices. I’ve had houses cleaned professionally in the very city I’m looking to Airbnb in for a fraction of these cleaning fees. I’ve seen cleaning fees nearing $300. For a two night stay? I’ve never paid more the $80 to have a house deep cleaned. I’ll stick with hotels. These outrageous fees make resort fees look appealing."

The app functions perfectly yet it always needs a tweak or some kind of new feature that requires me to tell people more about my property.

However after years of being an occasional airbnb guest, I can say that the bad outweighs the good. Airbnb always leaves things up to the host when it comes to cancellations and refunds. I feel like Airbnb should step up and when necessary, refund both the host and the guest for inconveniences. I never feel safe with my decisions in the app because I never know if the home I’ll be staying at will actually match the description, and if it doesn’t, Airbnb doesn’t care. Their customer service is horrible. This company is making so much money but they don’t care to help the customers. I’m uninstalling Airbnb and never using it ever again."

429,MM-gg,"November 2, 2019",1,"Airbnb is not customer friendly Airbnb uses a rating system in which both the host and tenant can publicly provide feedback to one another, which both parties then use to prove their credibility in the future. Because of that, there is a built-in incentive to avoid confrontation, which helps explain why Airbnb hosts consistently receive higher ratings than hotels reviewed on TripAdvisor, according to research out of Boston University and the University of Southern California. If a customer has a negative experience on Airbnb, they might be better off just moving on instead of leaving a negative review. Choose the latter option, and you could come across as too demanding to other prospective hosts, or, in extreme cases, even receive a retaliatory review."

One in particular...bed type, this is crucial as king bed is usually a deal breaker for me. I’ve ended up just booking a hotel instead of AirBnB on occasion while looking for accommodations because I just couldn’t waste time searching for this info.

We don’t qualify for “superhost” even though we have 90%+ occupancy and we can’t even find our listing anymore  because we aren’t “plus.”  Now all of a sudden we can’t get bookings because Airbnb is a bureaucratic nightmare of not qualifying for puffed up programs (even though we are as or more successful than most host) rich people getting listings seen first and politics.

They agreed and reversed the charge and now they are recharging my credit card saying I lied and there is proof I stayed there.  This is ridiculous.  I have been a long time user of Airbnb and this is unacceptable customer service. I did not stay there I have a receipt from the hostel I was forced to stay in."
464,Anniferann,"May 14, 2019",1,"Left with no place to stay We booked a home, and confirmed with the host. Our destination was 8 hours always, so we stayed in a motel for a night on our way there. The night before check-in we received a message that our reservation had been canceled. We found out that the host did not instigate this. It was due to a violation of their terms of service. We can’t imagine what it was. We talked on the phone with their customer won’t tell us or do anything about why they canceled it. They also are unwilling to compensate us for the inconvenience. If you want to know you have a place to stay, your better off in a hotel. If I could give them negative stars, I would. They have lost our trust."

The kitchen is huge and perfect for lots of family/friends to gather!! The rooms are ALL very roomy and perfectly decorated! If I had to pick one thing I loved the most, it would be the bed😍 I don’t think I have ever been in a more comfortable bed away from home! We look forward to staying here again!"

Her lovely home is located centrally in Supetar, just up the hill from Beaches and restaurants.  The room is impeccably clean, with the lovely linens on the comfortable bed.  The air conditioning works! Lucija is a charming lady, and a fashionable kind of way.  She does everything with charm and style. She is from the island, and knows so much about it. She can recommend the best restaurants and the nicest walks.  We would not hesitate to stay with her again."

When on the way to the next reservation I received a phone call and email that AirBnB was locking my account. This left me 1300 miles from home with no where to stay. I have called and no one will tell me any thing, after talking with them on the phone, I received an email from them with a link to the account that I’m locked out of. All of my reservations have been canceled. Every time I call I get the same run around. I will never use this useless company again, and I would recommend another site to any one reading this."
469,Momof3cuties,"June 12, 2019",1,Airbnb does NOT protect their guests!  I will not use again. We had a horrible experience with our last Airbnb stay. The woman we rented from was mentally insane. She first added on cleaning fees a week before our stay and threatened to cancel if we did not pay. Then after getting to the place and requesting toilet paper she flipped a lid and said we were too demanding and wanted us out. Airbnb did nothing to protect us. We had to leave our spring vacation early with no where to go because if this. Airbnb should have contracts with people and there should be a reasonable and viable reason to make someone leave. This did not happen.  Airbnb hosts have gotten bad all the way around.  I won’t use again.

Yes, I wish I could forward new bookings to the cleaner. I wish cleaner could be paid from within prefs. It’s annoying to see a ""can’t connect to network"" message every time app starts, but overall it’s pretty good."

473,Emrecan,"December 23, 2018",1,"Hidden booking fees are on a roll, app does nothing to address the pain points As a guest, read every sentence you can on an Airbnb listing because you might get hit with many types of hidden fees that are not baked into the price the app gives you when you book. Hosts charge $10/night utility fees hidden in “House Rules” and you are forced to pay after booking. Or they ask you to pay to City directly the local ordnance taxes because they don’t want to show that on Airbnb nightly price calculation. There was a time Airbnb was better because hotels had resort fees etc in that hidden pricing, now Airbnb is allowing hosts to play an even more sinister game through various creative ways of using listing details... beware."

I understand if a person may not want someone violent or a threat in their home but in that case you shouldn't share your home. Not that I'm violent at all because I've been completely rehabilitated but I'm thinking how deep can this go. Can someone deny someone an Uber ride because they're a felon? I'm a husband, father of 2 and a successful business owner. I've paid my debt for things I've done in my youth and I've given back more to society than I ever taken trying destroyed in the past.

I arrived late at night and had nowhere else to go, so I put up with the smell and messaged Airbnb support about it after I checked out. They waited 6 days to respond and just told me I should have confronted the host about it while I was in their house (which would have been extremely awkward and not something that should be a burden of the guest) and then asked me to provide “evidence” of the smell because my word isn’t good enough. I suggested they contact other independent guests who have stayed at this residence to ask if they smelled it too. No response and no resolution offered yet. I’ll never use Airbnb again after this."

They are very good at taking care of the payment and the guests questions. Airbnb is the best choice for Cabin rentals. If you look at the reviews of some of the other apps to list your property you will see why I think airbnb is the number 1 app to use. We have been using them for almost 3 years now and are so thankful that we did.

486,ejehdhshajd,"December 19, 2018",1,Customer Service Their customer service is terrible. I’ve been using Airbnb for years now and the last 2 times I’ve had terrible experiences. They don’t have a good standard for their hosts. They straight up told me that since the walls in the room I stayed at didn’t touch the floor (the walls were about 4” higher than the ground) and someone could easily look into my room that it is private and doesn't go against their standards. I’m also a host on Airbnb and I’m contemplating even doing that still. I used to tell everyone about Airbnb and how much better it is than hotels but now with 2 bad vacations and their terrible customer service that does nothing to help the customers I’m not so sure.

488,KiteboarderDelray,"June 8, 2019",1,Airbnb terrible service and allows fraudulent listings I recently went to Montreal and booked a month in advance. One of the places I reserved was a complete fraud. Airbnb didnt do anything to verify the legitimacy of the listing. In fact there was no building at the location. The area was booked and last minute cost twice as much for an inferior place. It was late and once I got to the next listing the internet didn’t work and was shown as an amenity. I work online so this wasn’t going to work. I feel like airbnb cares more about $$ and the host than the experience of the visitor/tennant. Hours on the phone with them. Who wants to team up with me to create a better company?  Airbnb needs some competition.

I contacted Airbnb and told them what had happened and the support person I spoke to was completely nonplussed. He talked over me, told me he didn’t understand what I was explaining to him, and basically put the onus completely on me for agreeing to go to the event. Not what I was hoping for.

495,cmsolomac,"March 6, 2019",3,Fix Lists!! Please please please fix the Lists feature!! Instead of auto creating a (difficult to delete) city list for each saved home you should auto add it to the last used list (with option to change). When planning a trip in a broader area encompassing multiple zip codes it is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING that each home I save creates a new list. Even if I immediately “change” the list it still creates a new city-based one (bug?). Also it shouldn’t take 3 clicks to delete a list. Stick to the simple swipe to delete interaction. Quick and easy.
496,Faxtor_,"March 29, 2019",2,"Functional but far too overpriced. The app in itself is a great concept. However, having to deal with the refunding/rescheduling system is a pain. It is understandable that the folks would want a bit of the money if they’re clients backed out. However, it’s is disgusting that they walk out with more than half of the subtotal. The rescheduling system. Oh boy, that’s also scuff. The amount required to pay for a reschedule outweighs the inconvenience of the clients backing out. Overall, you are better off spending a night at an hotel. I would not recommend this application to everybody, only those who constantly trouble and whose budgets are not tight."

There are great hosts on Airbnb and great rentals but I have found places that look great in the pictures that simply didn’t meet the expectations. Some host stage pictures to make their rentals look great or clim to have working amenities while knowing that it is not true. It would be helpful if Airbnb could investigate the accuracy of the renters property description along with the identified amenities to better ensure their customers expectations are met and not surprised.

Then a few days before checkin the host contacts me and says I have to email a copy of my driver’s license. That’s an indescribable security risk that would expose me or anyone else to identity theft. AirBnB does that verification for them. Despite already being verified through AirBnB and trying to explain the terrible risk they are putting me at they refuse to listen. I contact AirBnB support. They confirm that it’s against their rules. But it takes them days to get in touch with the host. At this point it’s only two days to checkin. Despite it being against AirBnB’s rules the host refuses to let us stay there. So it gets cancelled. Now our holiday vacation is ruined.

520,Halimaryland,"October 19, 2017",5,Love AirBnB! I consider AirBnB one of my travel essentials. I’ve enjoyed all my convenient stays in homes across the country. In cities that run out of hotel space or seem over priced - AirBnB often provides an affordable and convenient option. The reviews make all the difference. There are exotic choices provided here as well. I look forward to trying something a little unorthodox - like a tree house or boat at some point (when I’m not traveling for business).
521,gabehDUH,"December 17, 2017",2,"Declined I’ve used Air BnB before...through friends only. Whenever I try to book, I am always declined because I don’t have any reviews. If we still choose to go through Air BnB, I then have to have someone in our group, with reviews, book for us and then put the cost on my card. Here’s the kicker, even if the host asks for all our Air bnb profiles only the person who books gets reviewed. If it is known that the reviews matter to a great deal of hosts the reviews should post on everyone staying at the Air BnB. As it is, the app has only proven to be a giant waste of time for me, especially when I need to wait 24 hours to be declined."

524,Beebullbrox,"July 3, 2018",3,App is convoluted Used to love the app now it is just convoluted. The home page of the app is just filled with too much stuff with no way for me to filter “entire home” vs “room” vs etc. or if there is I can’t seem to find it. Instead they insist on filling the page up with things to do places to eat etc. wish they would fix this and make the app more user friendly. I ended up staying at the Marriott instead of using abb because of the barrier to entry. I don’t have time to fumble through thousands of entries just because the developer won’t make sub sections.

Been a host with Airbnb for over a year now — a super host for much of that time — and I am still in awe of their intuitive, easy to use, fun to use system. It’s magic and part of the reason being an Airbnb host is so great! How they have enabled all of us hosts to run a full fledged business so simply from our phones (or laptops...but it’s the phone interface that blows me away!) is AWESOME!     They deserve all the money they’re making with Airbnb. What great value they provide!"

I ended up searching in the App Store and sure enough, there’s a newer version available which now provides similar filters you see in the web app.  So if something doesn’t seem correct to you, just check to see if there’s an update for you in the App Store.  All good now."

The rest of the payment was due a week ago and for some reason, it couldn’t take it out of my bank account even though i had more than enough. I checked with my bank and everything is fine on that end. I believe it is issues within Airbnb itself. My trip better not be canceled and if it is, i will need all of my money back. This is absolutely ridiculous."

I had to call AirBnB four times-and I still haven’t received a callback from AirBnB about my concern. I only received one message on the Airbnb app from a customer service rep after my third call. I promptly responded to the message and answered all parts of the question. After my fourth call to AirBnB, I was told that my case was marked as resolved even though the customer service representative (yes, you Andrei) never responded to my message and never called me back. I find this highly concerning. If you’re going to let people host others in their homes, have some decency and call people back. This is pathetic."

I will never use the app again. To the people going to Daytona beach NEVER rent the place Daytona inn #201 you will get bit by bed bugs! The hosts are TERRIBLE people and liars.

The host was still allowed to advertise the same rooms for the same night in other listings even though they said they were ""fully booked.""  AirBNB allows a single host to advertise multiple listings for their rooms showing that they are available with no consequence whatsoever. This allows for blatant discrimination and/or overbooking of the rooms.  I will just stick to hotels in the future so as to not have to deal with this nonsense."

Even when the host agrees to refund you in full, AirBnb will support the host when they change their mind and will quite frankly call you a liar and not even refund you the correct amount of money you are rightfully owed according to the cancellation policy.

My state has been on lockdown since March 16. I cancelled on March 22 for my trip in May 6-9. We are still under lockdown (as the state government said and unable to fly in or out).

Also, your information is not secure on this website and dealing with customer service is a pain in the A. Someone successfully breached my account and trying to get Airbnb to do anything in a timely manner is impossible. Even when you have a problem with a host, they make you wait an HOUR in poor conditions before doing anything. Their customer service for personal data information breach is the same. Nonexistent.

So my reservation doesn’t qualify for a refund because my check in was supposed to be on 3/13. ONE DAY OFF. Absolutely ridiculous.

548,Magabar,"August 31, 2019",3,"Room for growth First, the app has limited capabilities. For more involved situations you will need a desktop. Second, as a host and as a guest, I would say that Airbnb has unequal standards. I find them more guest-minded. For example, pictures of prospective guests are not shown until an actual reservation is made and accepted by the host. But pictures of hosts are available to anyone doing a simple search. While I understand the need to avoid discriminatory practices, I don’t understand how that’s a fair practice. Lastly, they take a long time to answer questions messaged to them."

It’s also super annoying to have to repeatedly redo the filters (what amenities you want in a place) every time you switch the area you’re searching in. Seriously, regular old travel sites do better than this. If there’s a simpler way to do a search, then it really isn’t obvious - meaning it’s not very well designed for the user.

The place needed maintenance work and I told him about it and he couldn’t get that it would’ve been a nice compromise to raise the temp. NOPE!

579,738284$,"May 27, 2019",1,ZERO buyer protection Airbnb does ZERO to help or support people who have had their reservation cancelled for no reason. I once had a reservation cancelled THE DAY OF CHECKIN. Airbnb left us to find our own place even though we didn’t know the area at all. It ended up ruining our vacation. Now I’ve had a reservation cancelled again even though the renter confirmed with me they were expecting us in July. Airbnb was flippant in answering my concerns and just said the renters “had problems with the listing”.. even tho I see multiple reviews clearly indicating they are still renting. I think they cancelled so they could up the price. Either way - Airbnb DOES NOT PROTECT buyers. PRICELINE EXPRESS HAS WAY BETTER DEALS AND MUCH MORE PROTECTION!!

After going through a verification (in spite of being a long time user) process that cost me hundreds of dollars in hotel bills waiting to for the red tape, six weeks ago, I went to book another Airbnb to escape the horrendous air in Marin for the weekend. They said I needed MORE verification. So I wrote them explaining I had just rented an Airbnb a few weeks ago and time was of import as the air we are currently breathing is hazardous. They sent a form letter in return. I'm pretty amazed at their callous indifference. I've never had a hotel make me wait three days before I could book. I'm done with this company."

In two separate circumstances, I’ve booked a place to receive a message from the host stating that their places were not actually ready for hosting. When asked to cancel, they both played dumb and told me to, but that would result in a partial refund. When I tried contacting Airbnb about this, I was on hold for over an hour just to receive the dim news that my refund would be given days later. Having an extra 200 dollars taken away from weekend plans ruined an entire travel itinerary. Never using this app again."

Moreover, I got bunch of gift cards left on that account. I’ve lost a lot y’all.

I booked two night at a location an the service fees are $79 to use the app for booking??! Are you serious?! Also when you are interested in a location WARNING DO NOT PRESS THE HEART!!! It will save the booking as expected but when you go back it’s more expensive!!! I’ve seen it happen many many many times with in seconds of refreshing a liked place or page. The app will know you have interest and then add more service fees!!! I really hope someone creates another app like this one with less of a service fee to use. Plus customer service is horrible.
601,Ozmania sebas,"March 25, 2018",4,"It’s a great App I’m using the app a lot for the past 2 years , mostly great experiences . I think the host should have a “must” list before posting an add or at least aware the guest that some of the basic are not included . Example I stayed in a house without bed sheets , in another without hot water in the shower and a few times  without internet . Default queries should show accommodation with the basics instead of all as come with default . It would help to improve basic services among hosts."

The host responded they had “lost service” and that’s why they couldn’t respond. Also, Airbnb provides no security measures or anyway to regulate hosts, and does not accept responsibility for their hosts if they are shady or untrustworthy. If you have a family and are looking for a SAFE and GUARANTEED place to stay, stick with a nice hotel or another house rental company. Never again will I use Airbnb, and I warn all others to exercise EXTREME caution when utilizing this service."

This was AFTER I gave them a selfie and photos of my ID. Do they think my own photo isn’t who is on my ID? I have no idea because they won’t provide any explanation. I don’t even know why, suddenly, they were asking for this verification when I haven’t had to do it before. They wouldn’t provide any explanation for that either. I haven’t done anything wrong and have only had good reviews from hosts. I guess I won’t be using this company anymore. It’s a shame because I’ve had good experiences in the past."
643,Hannalaci07,"October 20, 2018",1,Terrible I reserved a room in advance and at 3pm the day before my actual date to check in they cancelled because of plumbing issues. They called when I was at work to tell me the bad news. I finally got off work at 4:45pm to head home to call Airbnb to which it was at 5pm. I’ve been on the phone with them off and on from 5pm-11:54pm complaining about the situation and I still don’t have a room for the actual next day. I had to tell them to give me a hotel for their lack of professionalism. I don’t recommend Airbnb because nobody deserves to go through this crap. I don’t deserve to cancel my errands for my visit in LA dealing with this crap.

This service is a great marketplace tool putting consumer purchasing power back in the hands of the consumer, and giving property owners a way to make income on their idle vacation properties, but the constant errors regarding searches, never ending bubbles that spin endlessly while the APP is searching, never yielding a result of my search, and error messages when contacting property owners/managers is completely frustrating.  I’m new to this APP and service, and would love to use it more, but if I can’t get search results, I can’t book.  Yes, my iPhone and iPad Pro are new, and updated.

I also had a friend who rented her home through airbnb and one Guest made a complaint saying how unsafe the neighborhood was , when all other Guest spoke highly of it and they banned her account. Be really careful with this company, they are not for the people & will ban you for no reason. Your money could be behind them and you’ll be the one to lose."

There is an issue with app that the Inbox doesn’t work as it shows “Network Error: We could not reach your network”. It happen recently for the past 3 months since Nov 2017 and still no fix for it. It causes some trouble with my communication with host in my previous trip as I have to rely on email Instead of in app communication. Otherwise it is a great app and great service.

We as customers had to cancel, it wasn’t out choice, so we should be refunded. Why should the host decide if we have to pay? They obviously will keep the money! It goes to them!

With Airbnb you sent them a text, get some automated message back and then days go by without a response. Once I got to stay in a place with roaches and once the place was filthy. Impossible to reach someone through the app for days. You have to make a decision to leave and then good luck finding a place in the middle of the night. Hotels have guaranteed, this is a crap shoot.

Even in an emergency situation regarding a hurricane, Airbnb would not help me adjust my reservation.

In addition to the unreliability of its platform and hosts, I have now wasted a week (and $) in which I could have just secured a hotel reservation with peace of mind. Customer service in the app/email/phone is non-existent. This occurred in the SF Bay Area too. I assure you are better off booking thru a hotel and using their rewards program.

The last booking to Miami the host simply canceled and refunded the money with no explanation as to why they canceled. Now I have to book something weeks before the trip and with much higher prices. The added stress is often not worth the lower prices. I’m booking a traditional hotel now. I would advise others to do the same especially if they have a family accompanying them.

You can’t assert your side and dictate whether or not users can experience certain entertainment! Why only marine mammals? Why not ban all zoo activity? Don’t care about the apes in captivity?

I do like the comfort of being in a clean, well kept home rather than a cold, lonely hotel room."

The Airbnb app hasn’t let me down as far as ease of use to send and receive guest messages, consult the calendar, make changes to my listing, etc. The interface is only a little different from the website, so I don’t feel like I have to relearn it. So far, I’ve been delighted (about to celebrate one-year of hosting!)"

We were skeptical and just doubtful as a whole about staying in a place that is not a hotel in cities that really we don’t know! But ooohhhh my has it been amazingly great! We have had amazing hosts! We feel blessed! Will keep using it and mostly since we have some trips booked already! ♥️ Thank you AirBNB for making the experience great!

Recently, we referred a friend and neither of us were allotted the referral credits. I called in and was sorely disappointed while talking to their crew. They were unable to fully resolve the matter and it left a bad taste in our mouth. Very poor customer service."

As it is a service being provided, I do agree that a fee should be charged for aiding in connecting guests and hosts. However, I am not happy with the clarity on what that fee is. In fact, I do believe that we are being charged more than the very vague percentage range for services rendered. As I plan to offer my home in future summers, I will potentially look into other services for this reason."

They usually are very pleased which makes me happy too. The scheduling and functioning is easy. Airbnb has designed it to be that way."

You can’t even talk with any of the developers even if you are a host that gives Airbnb the business they need. Absolutely ridiculous.

Went to book a place for that night and it didn’t go through because it was apparently already booked. I got a hotel room and when I checked my email I had a confirmation from the hotel and Airbnb so I was double booked. Airbnb wouldn’t give me a refund and I thought they were going to call me back but never did. Spent 200 dollars for an Airbnb I didn’t use.

To find out the true price you have to click into each listing one by one and waste your time before you get to see the ridiculous $800 cleaning fee, or three different “administrative” fees etc. Poor user experience and just ends up being the same cost as a hotel."

I was given 0 refund bc because of the “cancellation policy”..they don’t care if it’s unsanitary or bad for your health ... getting your money back will never happen because the host is capable of writing a cancellation policy in terms that save them not you .

It just continues to look as if it loading or the option to list my place pops up and that’s it. Often if I did try communicating with the host via the app it would read error freeze and stop working until I deleted it and reinstalled it.

And if the renter is checking in on the weekend, when bank transactions are limited, I have to let them in to my property, without a payment. No details what is included in charge, until its processed. No proof of payment sent to the owners. Cancelation policy is too short to find new renter, if anyone cancels.

As a result the host cannot send me the GPS coordinates of their place and other important information. It also removes links, thinking the host is redirecting you to their website, sometimes even if the removed text was not even a link. Pathetic selfish service."

I informed in the cancellation note that corona virus was the reason behind cancelling and they still say that’s not enough. I will no longer use this app for booking my stays.

It was expensive because a family of 4 required 2 rooms. AirBnB allows us to book one apartment for the price of one hotel room. Our accommodations will be much cheaper this year and they are such quaint and beautiful apartments."

845,Piotr N,"May 20, 2019",1,"A very flawed app The iOS Airbnb app has a major design flaw that makes using it downright dangerous: it does not display check-in instructions! This section of the reservation is only visible on the full website, accessible on a computer browser. Thus, if you arrive at your destination and have no access to a computer, you can easily become stranded if the host is not home or cannot be reached. The app also does not display the exact address of the house, which is extremely annoying when you are trying to take an Uber or a cab."

Hosts can set cancellation policy, why should not a guest, it goes both ways AIRBNB! Who actually pays your bills?"

At lower connection speeds it’s almost impossible to access this. A lot of people access this app on the go when they may be accessing airport WiFi. It’s shocking how inefficient this app is on the go. 
850,Lori VVV,"August 10, 2018",5,Happy Traveler We love Airbnb!! Don’t think we will stay in a hotel again. It’s so easy to find a place to stay and make reservations. We love the idea that we have the entire house to ourselves and with traveling with a group of people we can hang out together instead of having separate rooms and the cost is so much cheaper than a hotel.
851,watchful from SF,"August 16, 2018",3,"Difficult The locations should be better organized. When you request Sonoma, the app should allow you look at options within a proximity of where you want to be. Searching Nd finding places in Novato Or Santa Rosa were not helpful and took a lot of time. Also there should be upfront clarity on whether a place is available. Getting charged 2/3 times / getting refunded/ still not knowing if you gave a place is an enormous hassle :(((("
852,Indigomar,"August 16, 2018",5,Simple and easy to use Overall I find the app and the Airbnb rating system very user-friendly and easy to use. I also like the simplicity of the payouts and the reconciliation process or lack there off that’s required. Very straightforward and simple.
853,Carlin ramos,"January 6, 2019",1,"STAY AWAY Went to an Air BnB with a broken BED (the ONLY bed) and the host was completely disrespectful and told us that we were an inconvenience to her. This is the type of people that Air BnB ALLOWS to be in the hospitality BUSINESS. We were trying to work it out with the host at first and ended up leave and spending more money on a hotel. To top it off - Air BnB isn’t even giving us a full refund. Completely unethical and disgust for the lack of safety. This hasn’t been the only awful experience, but this was the last straw. I’ll stick to a hotel where I know my TIME and MONEY will be valued. Stay away."

AirBnB, you need a map and location filter on your mobile app. When I am searching for places to stay, I want to restrict the location to closest as possible to my destination, and in my search results I get things that are an hour or more away when I change filters for price etc. The app is not as good as the internet web page where you can see approximate locations on a map. Because I rarely use a laptop, I don’t book. It’s easier to use hotel booking sites that have this functionality. Awful app."

Why can’t you just automatically update new messages in the chatting page? I can’t understand. And if I’m typing right now, and I click “view message”, all the words I typed will be erased. This is a very bad design"
859,Catforlife,"June 13, 2019",4,Difficult to use gift cards My only complaint is using a gift card is difficult and restricted. You have to load it through a separate link and the balance cannot be used separately if you want to pay half now and half later. I need to contact Airbnb about that because I think they zero out my balance even though it wasn’t applied fully.
860,West82,"October 9, 2017",2,Calendar issues The app can be very helpful managing our listing but I have to say that I can’t access the calendar three to four days out of seven. This is a big deal as I am out of the house most days and have fairly full bookings. Not being able to see my calendar from the road is a huge problem. I have contacted Air BnB for this and other issues that I have had with app access and pre blocked dates opening up without any adjustment from me. I have yet to get a response about either issue.
861,Cap'nTom,"October 17, 2017",5,A positive experience There is a learning curve during which a new host must learn to follow their instincts and be selective about who they rent to. I find that it’s better to miss out on a rental than to take a chance on someone that doesn’t seem to fit. Almost every one of my guests was a delight to host!  Airbnb hosting is a seamless relationship that I can recommend to anyone. It’s fun and profitable.

One time I had to actually go through Airbnb to have them help to try and get the money from my guests and it didn’t go so well. I expected to have support from Airbnb but instead they declined my request and favored the guests when clearly they had destroyed a piece of my furniture. I am very disappointed in their process and how they handled the situation.
866,in pines,"August 6, 2018",4,"Pushie You keep pushing your hosts to sign up more properties, and refer more friends. This is a very specialized field, you have to own a property that costs lots of money here in Calif. and want to do this type of business with that property. I feel it is inappropriate for Airbnb to do this forceful advertising to their host and host friends. "
867,xcowartjx,"January 15, 2019",1,"Money stolen by prejudice host Some hosts on here are prejudice against other ethnic groups and sometimes twist the rules and policies to cheat me out of my money. Has happened three times in LA. Twice I got my money back. This third time, I was kicked out of an airbnb because my son checked in for me and the owner canceled. They didn't return any of the $585 I spent and are still telling me they aren't going to refund my money EVEN after I paid for a hotel after that terrible experience. These people have no ethics or morals and do not follow policies. If you are non-white, beware who you deal with on this app."

As a designer, I found the hierarchy of some UI screens to be out of order. There’s also something a bit odd about hiding the Book It button while scrolling around the rental pages.

873,supermommy8,"April 27, 2018",1,"This is a scam business Airbnb and the host try to take the money from whoever accidentally book the place through their apps. First, they keep your CC on their app, second when you book the place by accident, they “throw the ball” back and fort” just to refuse to give you back the refund. I cancel the reservation just after 15mins I made the the reservation by accident and Airbnb said I lost 50% of my money due to the host policy. Even though Airline ticket still allow you 24hrs cancellation for full refund...if you go to Orlando, be careful with the place “Fantastic Town Home in Gated Resort” host by Graham"
874,Dama LT,"May 26, 2018",5,Great app I really like the app and all what it offers. Very friendly use. The only part that I really feel very frustrated is the id scanning functionality.

875,Mandambrown,"June 5, 2018",4,Needs improvement on host reviews Airbnb is a great business model. My only complaint is they need to fix their host reviews. Guests can leave a “good” rating of 4 stars out of 5 based on the explanation by Airbnb to guests. When a guest leaves a 4 star review Airbnb tells them they are leaving a good review. When in all actuality Airbnb is turning around and telling hosts that 4 stars is not a good review and they can suspend their account for not receiving 5 stars.

882,Crdabl,"July 2, 2018",1,"Whatever you do, don’t host Airbnb is an excellent way to find interesting accommodation all over the world. I recommend it in lieu of staying in bland hotels. However; I do t recommend becoming a host at all. Even as a “super host”, and with Airbnb’s supposed “host guarantee”, you are at the mercy of your guest and will never be compensated for egregious damages that may occur. Airbnb doesn’t appreciate their hosts at all, their staff is condescending and sometimes straight up rude, and they could care less whether you keep hosting or not. Without going into long details - stick to using Airbnb as a guest. You’ll be happier for it."

Can’t ask for much more that that.

Each of us got what we wanted to ride and the tour guides were great showing us points of interests.  The tour size was perfect (7) too!  We will definitely be back - looking forward to trying other great rides they have.
918,The Zaphyman,"July 24, 2019",1,"Cancelled my reservation the day of travel It’s July 24, 2019, and we made reservations two weeks in advance to go to Niagara Falls to stay at this castle oasis in Buffalo New York. At 11 o’clock at night when we were sleeping, Airbnb canceled our reservation and then didn’t contact us until 5 AM about the cancellation the day that we were supposed to travel! This is an unacceptable way to run a business in the hospitality field. I am considering legal action"
919,beachbumG,"April 16, 2020",1,Robbing people of money This place is a joke.  They will take your money that you worked hard for and not give it back. They allow hosts to bully people into not getting their money back. I DO NOT recommend using this app. They will Robb you of your money and will give you every excuse in the book as to why they can’t give you your money back. Do not use them. They will only take your money when you need it most. First and worst experience of Airbnb. I work at a high volume fl restaurant I know poor customer service when I see it. DO NOT USE AIRBNB!!!!
920,Noelle The Reader,"March 13, 2018",3,"Good app, annoying to search with Searching through homes can be tedious for long-term stays. I don't care what the price per month is — they have extra fees and long-term stay discounts, so that's not the correct amount anyways. You can only see the exact amount you'd pay on the full-screen desktop website; I can't find it on the app at all. Very obnoxious when I want to know how much I'll actually pay to stay somewhere."
921,alcibades____,"March 17, 2018",3,"needs a way to change credit cards! I tried to switch my credit card on the airbnb app but couldn’t because there is no way to do it. What a nightmare! When I tried to login to the desktop site, the app kept opening automatically I had to delete the app and then open the desktop site and then reinstall the app afterwards. Seems like a pretty basic function to me. Switch payment methods."
922,EricSacha,"August 22, 2018",4,Changed travel as we know it Airbnb has revolutionized travel. I’ve traveled to over 60 countries and started way before the net and this service. Having options from Airbnb is blessing for those who travel and want a local experience. 
923,The Bueno's,"September 22, 2018",5,This first timer is happy This was my first trip booking an Air B&B. I was a skeptic at first but after experiencing two different apt in another country I couldnt be more happier to share that I loved the experience ! So grateful for this ability because I was able to save a TON of money on hotel stay when given this option ! I am one happy camper !
924,kalispellhost,"October 5, 2018",4,Good but... When in your profile it doesn’t update even though you have been alerted that there is something new. Such as a new review it doesn’t show up I have to go to my emailed alert to read it. Also a little to many alerts for the same thing! I kept getting emails to list my property even though I had. And other such repetitive alerts.
925,PVBarbara,"November 13, 2018",1,"Weak filtering Seems hard to apply filters and trust they are applied. Filter function seems to disappear when you get Into the listing. They use little icons to show you amenities, but when you go to look at the detail of the vanities, they don’t put the icon with the amenity, so there really is no legend for the icons. Much easier to search Airbnb on a desktop than with this app. I would prefer a filtering functionality more similar to a retail shopping experience, where it shows you on the page which filters have been applied."
926,Dpriceddd,"December 26, 2018",1,Less transparent pricing I’ll remove this review.. or update my review if my concern is addressed. In a recent update to the app Airbnb made it more difficult for hosts to see the breakdown in payout once a guest books
927,Suzu555,"December 13, 2019",5,Denver stay was great! Wow!  Our stay here was beyond expectations!  The place was super clean - which is my #1 priority.   It was a sweet and cozy place   - in a good neighborhood - with everything we needed - and closer to the places we went to than we thought it would be - which was nice.  So glad we went to Denver - and stayed here at Lindsey’s and Michael’s - it was a wonderful few days!

930,rtc2495,"December 20, 2017",4,"Great but still bugged Airbnb is a great app to search listings in almost any decent sized city in the world. While the idea is phenomenal, the app still needs a bit of work. On mine the map for the different homes never loads (despite fast wifi) and once every three or four times during usage it'll kick me out and make me start over. Fix these two things and it's a 5 star."
931,canalera,"February 22, 2019",2,"Air B&B So far my experience with Air B&B has been very disappointed.  Most of the time the amenities don’t match what it says it is (e.g., hot water, cable tv, WiFi, washer and or toilet paper) or even charging more if they cannot fill all the beds. For instance in Panama almost every place wanted to charge me extra for the empty beds and this wrong.  Also not providing basic toiletries during the whole stay is wrong. If I stay in a hotel basic toiletries are provided during my stay.  I’m thinking very seriously not using Air B&B at all."

We confirmed on our end that it wasn’t authorized, and then getting any help from customer service with Airbnb was like pulling teeth. They have a promised turnaround time for emails — which they missed. When I called to follow up, they were unable to provide any assistance, and instead kept referring to a specialist, who had neither a phone number or email address. "

It comes back with you’ve already logged in using the email account connect using google...use google, plug in email address again and password again and the it loops me back to the use google to log in page.  Kinda frustrating and right now I don’t need the hassle. Fire whoever designed this “feature”"
934,Bala R1,"June 7, 2019",1,"App needs many improvements This app is missing some basic functionalities. It shows the property available and when we book, it shows unavailable for some dates. Any user will think that the booking is not done and book another facility. But the original booing also went through and we endup with duplicate booking and no refund if we cancel later.  The app can be smart enough to spot duplicate booking and alert the user.  Very basic and surprisingly Airbnb don’t think through when the build this app"
935,nightlord23,"April 11, 2020",1,Can’t get money back even after Covid is out a hold on our lives. A group of friends and I had plans to visit hawaii and due to covid everything got cancelled. However Airbnb isn’t doing anything for us in regards to getting our money back that we put down. We are all completely upset with this company. Don’t know about ever using Airbnb again. Greed is all I’ve seen from this company throughout my process of trying to get our refund. If I could give a review with less than one star I would. I hope Airbnb fixes this.
936,dotherustle44,"March 4, 2020",5,Great customer service My conference was cancelled due to coronavirus. Janine was extremely professional and great at explaining what they needed from mean terms of documentation. Once they confirmed the conference had been cancelled due to Coronavirus they processed a full refund. This is the type of quality customer service often lacking in big organizations like airlines.
937,TravelingSimone,"January 16, 2020",5,Great site I love Airbnb and use it while I travel in the US and overseas. Only improvement i would suggest is to make it user friendlier to update your payment information. Either make its own Dropdown-Menu or indicate that you need to click on the Go to accounts in the help menu. Other than that this app is great!
938,GiphyRulez,"October 31, 2019",3,Its nice but finding better deals at most hotels lately let me include cleaning fee into price displayed.  It’s been a frustrating user experience to find places that match what i’m looking for only to find out the cleaning fee is almost double the stay.  I’m finding hotels to be tje cheaper option lately and use this app less because of the constant work I have to do just to see what the real cost is on each property.

Quit trying to give me “insider travel tips” FOR THE PLACE I OWN A HOME!!!  Stop trying to broaden your offering and provide some half baked “experience” and focus on your core product. "
941,forthright Guy,"August 4, 2018",5,The better rental experience Airbnb customer service is far and above better than any other service that I’ve ever used. They are pragmatic and solution oriented and they do not have a top down philosophy. They actually listen and try to resolve things which are actually resolvable. I highly recommend them.
942,QuartkneeJeen,"August 7, 2018",3,Location More information needs to be given for the location of the rental.  When I searched for location it gave me results more than an hour away and it was difficult to sort through all the criteria and not end up being so far from my intended location.  I understand an exact address won’t be given but it should give an estimate for the miles from the searched city.
943,Gato de Amour,"August 12, 2018",5,Makes Travel & Hosting Easy Airbnb’s App is user-friendly and intuitive. It’s fast and simple to research prospective lodgings as well as possible guests if you’re hosting. Notifications close the gap on wait times so you can book a space or accept a booking in an expedited fashion while you’re traveling in the back of a Lyft on on a jet.
944,Tom&Kathy,"August 13, 2018",5,Our experience My wife and I have used this app for a number of years to plan our trips and have had excellent results.  We always read the reviews and recommend that everyone considering a rental do the same.  Our most recent rental had 27 positive reviews and one negative.  We decided to go with the 27.
945,PaBobFin,"September 29, 2018",5,Very thorough and comprehensive application Being new to the Airbnb world as a host I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of the app.
946,D&T Seattle,"November 20, 2018",1,"Airbnb I’m so turned off by what you have become! The last few rentals have not been what I’d expect with pricing fluctuating, to people charging additional fees bc now there’s a place for “additional fees”. When I see “total cost” I shouldn’t be surprised by $200 additional dollars in charges. I shouldn’t pay $400 plus dollars per night only to see the same property available for $169 per night within a few days I my vacation especially when the dates I booked are off peak. "
947,jd0655,"November 26, 2018",1,Terrible customer service and poor app I will never recommend this company to anyone because we booked a vacation in Hawaii and went with a rental that we found on Airbnb app. The woman only had images of the bedroom and bath which was shared. When we arrived there the rest of the house was filthy and cats sleeping on the kitchen table. How could this happen? This company should require photos of the entire home. We had to stay there 10 nights because we had already paid for this. It was the worst experience ever! Never again would I trust Airbnb.
948,Da Weave,"November 29, 2018",3,"Fix the messaging This is a review of the app, not the service. The messaging part of the app that is critical for host-guest communication is constantly unreliable and lacks basic functionality for managing messages. I constantly receive error  notifications and can not send or receive messages to my host even using WiFi. I think more effort needs to be applied to making the app reliable then packing in new features."
949,bbbbuuuoooppp,"January 30, 2019",2,"Deceptive App Airbnb is great for saving money AND getting more experiences for your travel dollar. The app, however, is deceptive and should not be used to book travel. It only lists the nightly room cost, without revealing all of the service fees, cleaning fees, etc. that can SIGNIFICANTLY increase the total cost of the trip. The website is much better about showing these total nightly costs. I recommend using the website instead of the app until Airbnb does the reputable thing and fixes their misleading app."
950,jillcorr,"September 19, 2017",5,"Plain Awesome Airbnb has afforded me a way to make extra money for as little effort as possible. They take care of ""it all"".

Mostly polite and courteous. It's working......well."

I tried deleting & reinstalling the app. No go. I did an internet search on the topic. No solution. Tried to find a way to reach Airbnb. Not one. I ended up going old school & making my reservation on my laptop & uploading pics of my id. All in all, it was almost enough to make me walk away from this reservation."

Tried via site and app and each either doesn’t allow us to select to the next page. Website via mobile is super messed up, cursor for inputting data is in random parts of the page and you have guess tap where you think the tab should be for the next box for information. Called multiple times and was put on hold for over 30 mins only to be disconnected."
953,Josephmutti,"January 18, 2018",3,Pros & Cons It's been a few weeks since I opened up the house to Airbnb again and the experience has been mixed. Of the issues I have raised they have been resolved with great hassle or not at all.  It's not the same company I worked with back in 2014. I think it suffers from its own success and can now probably afford to go back to focusing on its users rather than on making more and more money (currently some 13%+ commission guest + host combined).
954,Tmtribesman,"February 4, 2018",2,App has trouble recognizing ID Was in process of completing a booking when airbnb forced me to create a profile and required a picture of a government ID. Then I tried for at least 20 minutes to get the app to take the automatic photo (with various light settings) once it finally took and uploaded the photos of the ID I confirmed the booking. THEN I get a text that the profile ID is unrecognizable and have to repeat the profile process even after charge went through! Terrible user experience!

It wasn’t until I downloaded the app that anything worked smoothly.  By the time I was finally able to book, I just took what I could find. There was also a server error during the night, but after that, it should not have redirected me a million times then lost my info."

957,nuevallorker,"July 14, 2018",4,Easy to use but needs small improvements Overall i find this super easy to use as a host. Would be better if the app didn't notify you that there's a new message in your inbox when that message was written by you! Also on iphone 7 plus i frequently have to close and reopen the app in order for the calendar to work.
958,Gunni girl,"July 20, 2018",5,User friendly I have been renting a carriage house on Airbnb for just over a week. The website is so user friendly it amazes me everyday.

960,Cstar,"April 19, 2019",2,"Annoying, complicated app designed to sell, not help The app is primed for booking rooms and selling tours but not good at managing existing bookings. It’s hard to find what you need in a pinch whether it’s the contact info of the host or the check-in instructions. Why can’t we access upcoming and current reservations directly from the home screen?  And the app is slow and frequently serves up mysterious errors, probably because their servers are needlessly overloaded generating unnecessary pages. Simplify, people."
961,Flymagget,"May 8, 2019",1,"Awful I was so disappointed with my experience. I waited so long to get approval for my stay and when I canceled reservations to find another stay I was messaged by the first host telling me they were about to approve it. Then I had an issue tryin to redo my reservation and had to contact three different customer support techs who were zero help. Then when I finally had all those issues solved and get into the room, the house was 85 degrees with a broken ac. It wasn’t fixed until halfway through the next day. I’m never bothering with this again."

Can't best the price."
964,hfkjdkjw,"February 24, 2020",3,"Airbnb The site is helpful to find an out of town stay, the process and communication with Airbnb is very poor. Jump through all the required hoops to have Airbnb not share with the host which I didn’t find out until two days before my stay, then having to contact everyone possible to refill out the same docs. Airbnb receiving their revenue and losing track in the consumer but that is my opinion."
965,Linz386,"January 15, 2020",3,"Not good for hosts There’s probably not many issues if you’re just booking stays. I’m a host and there’s constant delays and random glitches. There are fees that get taken out of our nightly rate for use of the platform, which I get but it seems like they should hire better developers. The point of the app is convenience, if I have to get on my computer it defeats the purpose of an app. Hopefully these glitches will get worked out soon."
966,Larissababey,"January 9, 2020",3,"Update removed saved messages????? I have been hosting for several years and have never had any issues. The app runs super smoothly.

973,Amandalvx,"July 9, 2018",1,Not very good. I use to have this app on my phone before and deleted it for the exact same reason why I just deleted it again. It has locked me out of my account multiple times even though I took the proper steps to try to get it unlocked. It told me someone would reach out to me in a few days but I’m not trying to book something in a few days I’m trying to do it now. So it looking like I’ll have to try another app to try and find something. Very unfortunate. Super disappointed in the customer service as well.
974,GeeGee1022,"August 9, 2018",5,Airbnb experience If you're looking for a place to be comfortable and just explore Airbnb is such a more intimate experience than a hotel. I love it!!

993,Sparky_007,"July 14, 2018",4,Great Great app - you can find places quickly with it. Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because (at least on the web version) I usually like to look at the map and decide but the map is usually very small and the screen space is taken up with all the houses in that area. I would rather it was at leas 50-50in terms of the use of space.
994,Crabby host,"July 27, 2018",4,"Satisfied customer I like everything about Airbnb. Customer service is great, bookings are more and the rates are below the competitors. The pricing could be worked on. No matter what I seem to price my unit at Airbnb puts us way below the market price in my area. I get more bookings but loose money after service fee. If I raise my rates it’s harder to book. I guess it’s just something I need to deal with."
995,TanTan210,"August 6, 2018",5,"Love using AirBnB We often travel in different countries and have really loved using AirBnB to book accommodation. It’s reliable and we trust that we will get a clean apartment in a safe area wherever we go. We have never had a bad experience. Booking is easy, payment is simple and every host we deal with has been helpful."
996,Famoozle,"August 6, 2018",5,"Fast and Easy Just used the app for the first time. Set up was quick. You have to trust them with an image of your driver license, but seems like the only way to make the system secure.

They have thought of everything that has arisen or could arise while being an Airbnb host.

I wish you can give negative stars cause I would definitely do that I don’t understand there customer service I ask four time to speak to a supervisor and the lady still going to to try and help! The verification payments are stupid and they don’t even send you two like they should they only send you one and when you call to ask when they going to send the second one they don’t even know!!!!!

I called back Airb&b customer service and they told me “we can reimburse for another room the %50”. They totally don’t care about anyone time and money. Thank you Airb&b for ruining our Christmas day!"
1009,MrsSchapansky,"August 5, 2019",1,Questionable Pricing I used to love using Airbnb but now it's just a headache. I don't understand how Airbnb can allow users to advertise a stay at their place for example for $124 per night and then their cleaning & service fees add up to $121 for a grand total of $245 ... Almost as much as the stay itself!!! So I'm left trying to navigate through this hot mess of shady pricing in order to find something that's you within my budget. Can you please change your criteria results so that they truly yield results within the price limits an individual selects.

We have a place we rent out to northern people during the winter months thru a real estate company.  This year I decided to put it on AB&B in July.  We have been booking the place ever since.  I love it.  It’s extra money to improve the place and you meet so really awesome people.  It’s a Win win all around.
1016,ArdmoreOkie,"August 24, 2018",5,"Airbnb is so easy Airbnb is so easy to book. We have enjoyed Airbnb booking and homes in Colorado, Broken Bow, Oklahoma and Texas.

At hotels I want to go somewhere and just sleep there but when I rent a home I can stay and relax."
1017,Cunnared,"October 8, 2018",5,"Love Airbnb I love Airbnb because it makes traveling and hosting easy; lots of choices. I think Airbnb should make it mandatory for everyone to use their correct names that matches their government ID. I had a lady using a different name to book. I was grateful that she told me her correct name, however; Airbnb should never have allowed that to happen."

If the app isn’t going to offer this, can’t it at least take my date range into consideration? It creates a new list every time I try to add something to my favorites. This makes it hard to create a list of my options and later switch them to a list of top favorites. Overall just lacking so many features that are pretty standard in most other apps. Love the service. Hate the app."

Where you can type in your budget but by the time you get to check out you have almost tripled the price. For instance a place with a $80 per night charge but the cleaning fee is $150 and the taxes and service charge take it from $80 to above $200. This makes the app extremely terrible and misleading. At least show the full price in the main menu when searching. And include complete charge in the description."
1026,Julius Crispis,"November 7, 2019",1,"Airbnb It’s cool, but if a host ever unfairly reviews you, it ruins your chances of booking places. Also, some of the customer service reps promise you the moon, then the next person denies you of anything close. Also there is a host named Robert in Philadelphia with 33 places he hosts, where he baits n switches, provides places with bed bugs and plumbing issues, fails to fix them and has numerous complaints. Airbnb is doing nothing to stop this guy. He should be banned period, for the bait n switch alone. Literally not providing a room even in the same building as advertised. Yay capitalism!"

Horrible company with nothing done to protect you from getting screwed over."

1035,Just back from overseas,"November 21, 2018",1,"Together Against Antisemitism On November 19, Airbnb announced that they will no longer list Israeli homes in the West Bank/Judea & Samaria on their site. This decision applies only to Jewish communities and not Palestinian ones, despite the fact that the final status of the territory remains under dispute and must be decided in peace negotiations. Furthermore, Airbnb continues to operate in Kashmir, Tibet, Northern Cyprus, Western Sahara, South Osetia, and other conflict zones. Urge Airbnb to reverse this discriminatory and hypocritical action, which will only fuel more injustice and conflict between Israelis and Palestinians."
1036,Gudoplo,"March 6, 2019",1,"Lots of hidden fees with no oversight Cleaning deposits are almost never returned.  And the prices advertised don’t reflect the fees.  You can easily rent a spot for $75 per night with a $100 per night cleaning deposit when the owner does not clean daily.  You can leave a place spotless and never see your cleaning deposit back.  Half the listings are not monitored by the owners and booking a place definitely does not mean you will be able to stay there.

Because, don’t worry, you can still snag a “modern apartment studio” in the city-center of Sevastopol, Ukraine, annexed by Russia. And Airbnb will hook you up with a “Cozy Studio” near Gulshan-Baridhara in “Tibet, China” — formerly known simply as Tibet.

Took almost two hours of dilly dallying to make the reservation. Went back in to check and the reservation did not show. Checked with my bank and the money had been removed from my account. Reservation still did not show. Three hours later I finally got confirmation of cancellation. Funds still not returned to my account and the phone number listed was a wrong number. Very poor site.

We had to look for another apartment (double pay) to change us and Airbnb appeared with an apology letter 5 days later when we were back from our trip."

1225,I do not have another,"August 12, 2018",5,Owner I have my new house and everything is high end.  Every guest has been treating my cottage as their own.

Also, guests ask to see current pictures of the space they are inquiring about. That validation can not happen either in this new app version. This is a terrible update to the app. It feels like airbnb cares more for the traveler than the host."

The place I rented was super dirty and had major safety issues and Airbnb refused to refund my money.

I strongly recommend finding another options like Homeaway or stick with hotels. Never ever experienced such rudeness in my life!"

1241,SavageHost,"April 26, 2018",5,So much better than VRBO! As a host and traveler I think this app is so helpful and easy to use.

1248,pcbkim,"October 6, 2018",4,"Direct contact It would be nice to be able to have direct contact with a guest once they are booked and have paid. Amy had questions and it was always an issue going through Airbnb to address them. Had she been able to text, it would’ve been much more convenient."
1249,Kebo the Don,"October 12, 2018",5,Great App Fast and Easy to use. Only suggestion is the “saved” feature. Sometimes locations that I’ve saved are not in the saved folder when I return. If there is a way to fix that glitch it would be perfect.👌
1250,HombreLoco,"November 7, 2017",1,"Horrible Customer Service and Lying Hosts We requested to book an apartment only to be told by the host that there was a pricing issue and he “could not confirm our reservation.” Ok - fair enough, we’ll just book another place, which we do. Then we find out that he actually accepted our reservation and will not refund our money due to cancellation policy. Air BnB customer support is being next useless in this matter. So the hosts are allowed to lie and the customer support is worthless. Just book at a hotel or hostel."

I was stuck outside in the pouring rain, cold, tired and wet. Did not even stay in the apartment and the host refused to refund me. I never was able to step foot in the apartment. Customer service and the company’s policies protect the host and not the traveler.... which seems backwards since most people are traveling to an unfamiliar location, hoping their booking accommodations go as planned."

Definitely returning."

Great app. Runs smoothly and easy to navigate.
1255,Rogueimage,"January 2, 2020",1,"Terrible app design The AirBNB app doesn’t let you sort results by distance from a destination location, neither does it show the results on an overview map. It returns results in no apparent order over a huge (100 mile) area, and the only way to find out where each one is is to tap them individually and scroll down in the details. Is it too much to ask that when picking a place to stay I want at least a rough idea HOW CLOSE IT IS TO MY DESTINATION?!! This is a very, very basic UX design error."

1258,BKNJ79,"September 25, 2019",1,"Nasty, unregulated & not worth it The 30% Air B&B adds to the final cost, makes this site completely irrelevant. By, “taxing,” the customer that exorbitant a fee, these prices meet and exceed that of many hotels, and hotels are FAR cleaner, more sanitary, more comfortable, more convenient and have countless more amenities, comforts and conveniences. In addition, the awful feedback I’ve read on the vast majority of these, “Host’s posts,” are disgusting and there needs to be another level of state inspection here. Lastly, there’s a lot of fraud occurring on this site."

1261,nnnnnicckkknaaame,"June 8, 2019",1,App and desktop browser pricing different The pricing on the availability calendar in the app does not match the pricing that was quoted to me by the host when I requested to book - even when averaged out over the length of the stay. The average price was $313 per day (when averaged) and rose to $348 (before fees) when I requested to book. When I went to the desktop version I realized that this feature (pricing on the availability calendar) wasn’t even available. Big thumbs down airbnb.
1262,Chris3958285,"August 19, 2019",1,"Booked and room and found it dirty. Poor customer service. I would rate 0/5 if I could. I booked a room for me and a guest and when we showed up the room had not been cleaned from the previous guests. After further investigation, it was not the host’s fault but rather a fault in the system that allowed us to book that reservation. After talking with Airbnb’s customer services multiple times they only offered to refund half of the cleaning fees after they admitted it was a mistake."

Please make this an easier experience."

1270,Huge annoying mistake,"June 3, 2018",1,Read all of the details App seemed great at first until I booked a trip that I haven’t even been on yet and I’d like to add I’m not excited about anymore. The host seemed very creepy and wanted to charge more and after a few messages with him I wanted to get a refund but when I tried I was only going to get half of it back due to the strict refund policy of the host. My trip is still a month out and I’m really wishing I had never used this app. Next time I will stick with HomeAway which is a much better app.
1271,JOCmymostfavorite,"June 27, 2018",1,"Terms of Service Update I find it very concerning that the Terms have changed and my only option is to agree or be logged out of the app!  How tremendously discourteous and nonsensical, as the notice also says ‘read each item carefully’.  Is the hope that users agree in order that we can access guest messages and maintain our response time in lieu of the ‘careful reading’  suggested?  I use the app all the time and it’s such a great tool.  Today’s experience could have been better."

However, the app is TERRIBLE and that’s what I’m rating here: it almost never works, sending a message to someone through it takes hours sometimes and there are always “errors.” It’s so strange that Airbnb itself is so great but their app lacks so much—no matter what kind of service I have it never works well. Just disappointing when using it on the go."
1274,Sharon Southwest,"August 9, 2018",5,Easy Peasy I am a newbie but I believe this ap is very well designed. I was very nervous about juggling schedules and  having guests use our home (even though we have rented many homes from Airbnb) but the gentle reminders and the calendar help tremendously and so far the guests have been nice and (seemingly) good human beings.

1283,Veronica Tee,"January 6, 2020",3,"Great prices, annoying search process There’s no denying the prices are great, but the search filters don’t include size bed.

Additionally, the room wasn’t even as advertised. What made me leave was the actual feces (not in the toilet where it belongs). I only got 50% back and the host called me a liar in his review of me. I’m pretty much done with Airbnb. They only care about their hosts—that’s how they make money. Hotels actually care about guests. "

Airbnb says you have to contact the host to find that information. That’s great except hosts have lives and are at work, having dinner, going to the gym, etc. And you are left wondering if you can use the kitchen or use the WiFi or anything like that until they get around to responding."

She knew I was very unhappy so she knew I wasn’t going to give a good review, so she never reviewed me. Very misleading. I doubt I ever use again.

1336,Mikey Romano,"September 28, 2019",3,Cleaning fees? Folks I love this app but the arbitrary cleaning fees make it harder for the customer to compare pricing. Hosts need to be accountable for this bait and switch by showing the per night rate INCLUSIVE of all fees. As it stands now you’re allowing hosts to bait and switch (with sometimes $30 ‘cleaning fees’) only to find out at booking that the total price is too high. Stop wasting customers time with this for the sake of hosts interests.

You know there are planes that land that late ? People get off from work that time ? I mean life is still going on at 11pm why would there be a curfew ? The owner would have the ability to decline a rental if it was to late for them right? So why put a limit? That’s insane

But neither Airbnb nor the host will cancel for us and issue a refund. The host is non responsive. So even though the reservation cannot be honored legally (not by us but by them), we are the ones paying for it. Even though we raised this issue over a week before the trip. Profits over people."
1615,AE 719,"February 29, 2020",1,Worst mobile app If you rely on your mobile device to manage your short term rentals I would suggest a different hosting company. It works 1 out of 20 times. Constant error message which prevents you from seeing the calendar or messages.

First couple came back as “unavailable due to maintenance issues” after a successful reservation. The next couple were not successful due to scheduling errors inside of the app. Then the last was unavailable due to the owner not understanding how to list their house. Ridiculous. Won’t be using again.

The message they sent from the app didn’t lead to anywhere for payment but just kept bumping out. Then I received 6 email and 6 alert in app within 2 minutes. This is so annoying and I can’t believe this is what airbnb I’m dealing with. Totally disappointing.
1626,Hottie wisie,"April 24, 2019",3,Needs improvement You need to come up with a new algorithm where the nonevent houses are separate from the event houses. It is incredibly hard to find a house where one can throw an event without the exhaustive list. Please look into this so the app will be more manageable to your users. Otherwise this app is great for a peaceful night out.
1627,Cassandy70,"May 10, 2019",4,Time to review I do not like that you have a timeline to write reviews. We can’t always write reviews right away especially coming home from vacation and right back to work. So the places that deserved good reviews did not receive them because of Airbnb’s policy.

Airbnb will let its hosts take all these risks and not only doesn't help you understand local laws but actively obfuscates them because the more illegal rentals the more money they make, meanwhile the onerous financial burdens fall on the host who was trying to improve their financial situation, and instead gets harmed by the deceptive practices.

Unfortunately every experience I’ve had of late is a flurry of emails between me and the host to get to actually stay in the place. While on the go I just need to know where I’m going and when and I’m fine. Aside from that I don’t need 5 emails to finally learn how I will access the apartment. Traditional hotels have won out for me.

You likely will never get a refund either way so I say book a nice hotel instead. The host and AirBnB customer service were both very bad after we complained and they completely sided with the host."

It’s gotten quite ridiculous and it’s honestly cheaper now to just get a hotel than get an airbnb and that’s sad because this app was once great. It is dead to me now.

They want to make money for any cancellations even though the hosts make no money. I think this is evil and greedy strategy because they will make money twice next time someone books the place for same dates. This should align with the hosts policy. Worse than hotels who have full refund for 72 hours. Disappointed.

Surprised and put off especially by his attitude, we declined.  Told Airbnb.  But because the owner told Airbnb he had ‘renovations scheduled’ rather than the truth about misrepresenting the rate, he was not penalized.

I will log in through via the Facebook method, I will browse for about 45 seconds, and then AirBnB prompts me to log in yet again. After doing this 4 or 5 times, and after re-downloading the app, it still fails to work. It’d be cool if I could use this app for its intended purpose, but apparently that’s too much to ask for."

1880,jvtiovftyio,"April 21, 2019",1,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I would highly recommend NOT using Airbnb EVER! Customer service is HORRIBLE! The place we booked looked NOTHING like the pictures. It was EXTREMELY DIRTY and UNSANITARY! The host was RUDE and didn’t do ANYTHING to resolve the problem. He sent us CHECK IN instructions to a TOTALLY DIFFERENT ADDRESS than the one listed on the actual booking. Customer service DID NOT hold the host accountable for the horrible experience that we had. They also won’t give you your money back.

Within hours of activist and verifying my account, it was suddenly suspended for no apparent reason.

I have heard this happening to other people, too. Having minimal communication with the customer is just tacky."

People smoking pot in the streets, a fight broke out right outside of our cab. The place was obviously unsafe. We left and could not and would not use this accommodation. I reported this to AirBnB. I got no refund whatsoever. AirBnB should make sure that their listings aren’t in dangerous areas. This should go without saying."

Even if a host tells you they will cancel but lie bc they don’t want to get penalized... Airbnb will still take your money! Beware of the “great” reviews that fake accounts use to leave positive reviews. The places I stayed at had amazing reviews but when I got there it was HORRIBLE!!!!

I asked for help so many times and all they came up to was that my account was not compromised. Are you serious?! I can’t believe their reasoning! They can’t even help you with something as serious as this!

2190,NYCEDC,"April 17, 2018",1,Worst customer service Not every host is nice and the pictures and reviews not always honest. If you bad luck enough the customer service will slam you out. They won’t stand by customers side to thinking problems Cause they charge fee from the owner. Will not recommend to anyone any this app will not last long. Too much safty and potential problems are hidden.

2199,Ieatalotmanalot,"August 4, 2018",3,support needs to improve Not satisfied with the support you receive when the host is being difficult or not answering.

2205,vvgfrrdd,"February 20, 2020",1,Absolutely Awful They scammed us out of money. We were mislead on a booking and when we canceled they refused our full refund. The listing was for an entire house and ended up being right under the house these people were living in. Airbnb refuses to acknowledge that it was the hosts mistake and will not refund us in full. I highly recommend you just keep scrolling.
2206,dwh2427,"December 22, 2019",1,"AirBnB let me down After discovering a large bug in the app (the cancellation policies are missing 50% of the info that the desktop versions show, which is clearly a major omission), telling everyone from support through to the ceo - no one seemed to make any change / despite it costing me a $3k booking.

2211,tikikkk,"November 20, 2018",1,"Anti-semitism should not be tolerated I have enjoyed using AirBNB in the past. Their announcement now caving to BDS demands of removing Jewish listings from disputed territories, while having no issue leaving up listings in other disputed parts of the world and palestinian listings in the disputed areas in Judea and Samaria makes it clear that this is anti-semetism, not about not having listings in disputed areas.

This was they second time it happened for the same trip. Lesson learned. It worked fine for a few previous domestic stays but I won’t use them again due to their lack of empathy and refusal to correct their mistake.

The support team behind Airbnb are on the hosts side so if you have a bad experience just take it on the chin and move on.

You just get bounced around from agent to agent and get nowhere. Everyone has a different excuse for the issue. Plus they pretty much take your money and offer no refunds. Stay away from this company and save your headache and hard earn money.

The “customer service” rep is flat out rude and refuses to connect me to a manager. You can’t add local taxes to your listing. You can access the resolution center via their app and that goes for guests and hosts. Go to VRBO. Don’t waste your time with Airbnb.

2452,Pauladi,"September 9, 2018",1,Guest issues Not happy with the way Air BNB qualifies people.  My last two guest not good.  The lower you put your pricing as they suggest the lower quality people you receive.  My last guest came home a bit tipsy and started undressing his shirt in front of me.  I had to run to my bedroom and lock the door.  I have since turned down 4 guests as i am uneasy with air bnb now
2453,Beanyfrombrooklyn,"September 13, 2018",2,Money bug I am a fan of the app. However they now have a bug in the app that is very significant. When you send a special offer it changes the price to a single day so if you are not careful you will submit it and then have a real problem on your hands.

I was in the hood and a fire broke out and it was accompanied minors on the premises and nothing was done about it. Smh. I asked to be moved and they told me they couldnt. I pay money to this company and they dont do anything for me?? Dont use Airbnb. I cant wait until there is another app where they treat their guests better. Smh.
2633,jay5r,"January 22, 2020",2,"So Irritating… Every time you leave the app when you come back a few seconds later it puts you back to the home screen which means you have to refund whatever it was you were looking at. That’s horrible, user-hostile UX."

A few times have had hosts cancel a day before and been forced to pay for expensive hotels instead. When I bring issues up to support team they are sarcastic and rude.

Apparently airbnb does this often, discrimination at its best."

Airbnb did not charge a security deposit (even though our requirements were such) and because we did all of the work ourselves they found no need to collect the required deposit.
2727,vander1982,"January 13, 2020",1,Terrible choice This App looks good in a big picture but in details has lots of flaws. They take way more care about their hosts than the guests when it comes to reviews and acceptance of the guests. On the other hand if any issues comes up for hosts such as pricy damages Airbnb steps back and let’s the two parties fight for it
2728,SharkDoc69,"January 2, 2020",1,Horrible I am an owner and this app never worked for me. It’s sporadic at retrieving messages and 99% of the times it won’t send a message.

Sometimes don't get message notifications.  So frustrating since I need it to manage accommodation for guests.

2762,Petty Paige,"October 16, 2019",1,Do not book here unless you’re paying top $ for a room The hosts are extremely unprofessional and the customer service representatives do not care. They will try to fix the situation by putting you in a gross room in someone’s house in your birthday. Do yourself a favor and just get a cheap hotel. Save yourself the headache.
2763,Doss12343,"September 26, 2019",1,Using Gift Card If you are using a gift card beware don’t divide the payment they have a small scam there will take the second payment from your credit card and tell you oops we don’t know how to fix it. Pay the whole amount with the gift card ;)

2769,NahidAhmed92,"June 25, 2019",1,Horrible customer service. Airbnb policy and customer service is just ridiculous. Never booking with them again. First time booking through my own account and I had the worst experience. I lost my money because the hosts place was unsanitary. How does that make it my fault. Ridiculous.

Good luck trying to get a refund for the money you spent to not even sleep at the house. Just get a hotel then you can be sure that under circumstances you can’t control you’ll at least be refunded for your troubles.

2789,Frdafcyuutiftufiytfi,"November 23, 2018",1,Israel Strange to find that Jews are only able to list their places in areas that Airbnb considers to be theirs.  Yet members of any other religion can list their place anywhere. A moslem in England or a Christian in India. But a Jew can’t list a place for rent  in most of Jerusalem simply because he or she is a Jew.

I will delete this app and never use Airbnb again."

Airbnb refused to take any action against the host, and would not even issue a refund, despite the safety concern we experienced.

2988,Chris McDonkey,"November 28, 2019",1,"So many bugs This app is bugs galore. You'd think for a Superhost they'd be able to provide you with a stable platform.

Waiting up to 15 days for separate resvervations totaling over $1500. Insane how you can just hold someone’s money hostage, so close to someone’s vacation. Terrible terrible App. Needs a lot of work."

When I reported the issue to Airbnb they were no help whatsoever and I was out $300 despite not even staying at the place. The host canceled me because I warned him I was deaf and might be loud. I had already paid for the first part of the bill and Airbnb did not help me get my money back.

3001,lbdcreative,"November 20, 2018",1,Extremely disappointed There are conflicts all over the world. Why does Airbnb feel the need to make a political statement all of a sudden when it comes to Israel and particularly Jewish residents? Call it what you want but when you single out Jewish business to boycott - and only Jewish business - it's antisemitism.

They are not helpful over the phone. I can’t wait till they get adequate competition to make this step up their customer service. Luckily Expedia is booking similar spaces now. And HomeAway from home App.

3015,Gmfretin,"October 2, 2018",1,App is neccesary to use website The app might be nice and all but you HAVE to use it to upload pictures of your license.

3041,Disgusted55056,"March 30, 2020",1,Host guarantee is a LIE Airbnb is total crap for hosts. Everything is guest centric—guests can break house rules and destroy stuff with ZERO repercussions. “Security deposit” is a joke. Zero support for hosts with evidence of guest damages.

3044,Yordanov,"January 17, 2020",1,Terrible app from UX perspective The app and website are terrible. You inquire about 5 properties then you can’t see which reply is for which property. You can’t manage payment methods in the app. You book and it hangs! Perhaps you should hire someone competent to redo the app? Other than that the database of properties is good.
3045,world traveler 2019,"November 2, 2019",1,"No protection of the guests Be careful when booking with Airbnb, because they have no interest in protecting guests.

I have been traveling the United States for the past month and have not stayed at a single AirBnB yet that has disappointed, frightened or disgusted me (words I reserve to describe motels). Each one has been AMAZING! They are sparkling clean, comfortable, and inviting because their hosts care. Hosts are friendly and accommodating, while easily allowing you adequate privacy. Most often, access to full kitchens, free laundry units and supplies, and lovely leisure locations (such as green back yards, relaxing porches, functional bbq stations, etc.) are included in the price of your stay. Did I mention the price yet? Always cheaper than a hotel or motel. Every. Time. It’s beautiful!!! "

If I could give her place and service a 10-Star review I definitely would! We just had a wonderful 10 day stay in her rental and this was our FIRST AirBnb experience. We arrived late and for some reason we struggled to get the front door lock opened (we failed to turn the key ALL the way to the left). I gave Norga a call and immediately Linda came down to let us in (buy this time we had finally figured the lock out and was actually in the hallway as Linda was coming down.  She gave us a warm greeting (I gave her a hug because she felt like family -Like a aunt). The front door of the flat leads you directly into the kitchen area. The kitchen was picture perfect and I noticed a large bowl of fresh fruit sitting beside the sink. She showed us around the flat and where everything is located. She has a note pad above the fireplace mantal that has her and Norga's phone number along with a couple of taxi cab companies that offer reasonable priced trips ($54)to JFK airport. After showing us the home she asked if we needed anything, and told  us know that if we need anything she is just a phone call away."

I wanted to go the my next destination, but I'm traveling alone and wasn't sure if it was safe for me to travel there with political unrest. Political unrest can change quickly into a situation that is unsafe. After watching videos on the news of violet protests, I chose to cancel my reservation choosing the ""extenuating circumstances “ option, the option you are supposed to chose for political unrest at your airbnb destination, and and I spent the evening trying to convince airbnb that I should receive a full refund. They gave me the refund after calling me to scold me for not contacting telling the host why I canceled. When you select ""extenuating circumstances"" option to cancel, you are prompted to tell airbnb why you canceled, which I did in detail. You are not prompted to tell the host. I was under the impression that I had done everything I needed to do to cancel the reservation. But a case manager called me a few times, messaged me and told me they had called a few times, called me again afyer I told them I didn't answer because I didn't recognize the phone number and thought it was a telemarketer and to please call me back, and scolded when I answered. The case manager asked if I had questions or needed any help with anything else and when I asked about an experience that I was trying to cancel at the location of the reservation I had already canceled, proceeded to tell me that there was a case manager appointed to the case and to contact them."

This made me the bad guy with the guest if I said no and it makes it an awkward living situation.

Then Friday, i get a notification that our trip has been cancelled and we are being fully refunded. This trip is only a few months away in Nashville, there are hardly any affordable places left for 12 people. Anyway, I contact customer service to see what happened and I find out the owner is listing her house for sale so she had to cancel all of her reservations. I message support and they tell me that since I chose the full refund option (keep in mind i didn’t chose any option, it was just auto refunded) That I’m not eligible for a discount on my new booking. So I book a new place and they follow up after I say we been paying interest on the credit card that we booked with originally so we’re losing money off of this they offered to give me $25 off my next booking and I say OK that’s a terrible compensation but you can apply it to our next payment for the house we just booked. Then they say they can’t apply it to something that’s already been booked. This is the most ridiculous customer service I’ve ever had to deal with I shouldn’t have had to call and ask to get compensated for that huge inconvenience, it should have just happened and nothing even happened in the end of it, we lost money with the interest paid on our card and had to book a new place. It was a huge inconvenience on our trip, we lost money and I will never use this app again after this next trip and I advise that you don’t either."

4968,halfcupofyogurt,"March 18, 2020",1,"Terrible app: Crashes. Limits what you can do so you need to call the customer service. AirBnb needs to invest in making the app more functional and reliable. It is slow, crashes frequently and does not give the functionality of the website. Specific example would be, a guest needs to change the reservation while staying in the room. So he uses the app to only change the check out date but the system forces to choose a check-in date but does not allow you to go back more than a week. So if the guest has stayed more than a week and needs to modify the check out date, tough luck, you cannot do it through the app. You need to call the customer service. Honestly this is one of the best costumer service I have ever worked with. But the wait time may be long. Due to Covid-19, the guest is eligible for full refund for cancelled days if the reservation was made between certain dates. Why not program the app to reflect this. Why force the guest to call the customer service and wait more than an hour. My guest was from Lebanon and he cannot call using his out-of-country phone and pay roaming charges. So I had to call and wait an hour. I am writing this as I am waiting so I have no clue when they’ll answer. Only if the app did what it is supposed to do, there wouldn’t be thousands of people calling. Airbnb please invest in the app and reduce your customer service costs while serving hosts and guests better. Not related to the app but one guest writes a bad review and gives one-star rating for each category and you suddenly lose your Superhost status and cannot recover for a year. This happened to me when a guest wanted to check out a few days early and I did not agree to refund, he gave bad review quoting other stuff, with zero proof. AirBnb policy does not allow to delete a rating once in. I have 16 rooms and started to list in HomeAway and others."

I used it for a really long time and have travelled the United States on this app alone. Countless times referring my military friends and others trying to get some credit of course, but it seemed it never really worked or in other words if the person that clicks your link goes to another screen or anything to reload the download of Airbnb your link is now gone and no credit will ever be accounted for. Whatever kept using the app anyway I have to say it worked once or twice. My account has now all kinds of purchase history years later stayed in so many locations supporting them none the less of this initial grievance. Now this year kind of tested my patience and was different, I purchased a 100$ gift card for my sisters vacation/Christmas she used to stay and signed up for the app and still no credit was even registered for me... I finally was fed up with not getting it and finally tried to do something about it when the app support told me I did it wrong and I couldn’t possibly have referred my sister. I told them her name and even tried to plea with support telling them they can talk to her, and they reply saying I have to use the link correctly of course. I was pretty upset they didn’t check my 8 years of account use or try to do anything to compensate me or help me and let me go on saying I won’t be using this app anymore. I used to use it to get away from the hotel saturation but now I guess they have become it. Thank you while it lasted Airbnb."
4990,identity theft risk,"October 12, 2017",1,"Worst experience ever I was recommended by multiple people to use this business for accommodations in Florida. My experience was horrendous. I completed all the appropriate steps as listed on their site, yet was unable to reserve a house. After multiple calls, I was told I needed a photo of myself. I did that. Still could not place a reservation. More calls to their customer support. I then learned I had to submit front and back photos of my drivers license or complete passport photos. None of my friends who use this site regularly have ever had to do this step. This step is not listed on line as a requirement in their simple 5 steps to get started. I gave in and submitted my ID photos. Still unable to get a reservation. Multiple calls, long waiting times with the response being....that my problem was being submitting to higher up tech support and some one would call me back. No call backs ever happened. I was emailed instead, so no human had to talk with me. I was told that my credit card would be billed a small amount and I was required to show picture proof of it on my credit card statement. At that point I had enough. I should not have to show anyone my credit card statement. Again, none of my friends were required to do this. All that personal data is not needed... and I’m now risking identity theft. I spent a total of 8 hours that day trying to get a reservation that never happened, wasted a day and ruined my birthday. I did however, receive a follow up call 2 days later asking if I still wanted to reserve accommodations with them. I nicely asked them to delete my account and all my personal information. Hopefully, they did. I can promise you....  I will never use this business again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone. Biggest mistake I’ve made in a long time."

I used it twice the first trip went smoothly but the second one was a different story. Not only did I get scammed out of 100 dollars from one of their hosts that they supposedly do background checks on or supposed to do. The customer service was a joke so unprofessional. They did absolutely nothing at all. All they did was state that I should not have gave the host the money outside of the app even though he said if I did not he would not let us stay in the Airbnb which we paid upfront one month prior to the day of the con. The host abused of his authority and took advantage of me and my girlfriend for our first comic con that was supposed to be great experience for us but ended up being a disappointment. He gave us the impression that he would give us the money back but did not end up doing so. I called customer service a couple of hours after and they did nothing but open up case upon case upon case. Giving me hopes of maybe having a chance to get my money or at least for them to take action on the host. I called them today after 4 days of them not contacting me at all to keep me updated with me case. Yeah me keeping in touch with them doing their job funny right. Well someone answered and finally some with the guts to tell me bluntly that they cannot refund me my money because it was 3rd party payment which I did not know. I was like fine as long as the host gets penalized for abusing his power but they said they cannot do anything because they need to contact him and get his side of the story like assuming I was lying. Well they did and he admitted that he charged me a deposit to the customer service and customer service told me that he said there was something with his cash app to send me back my money after almost a week of waiting for him to refund me my money. I said well we will see if he gives back my money and I asked customer service if he doesn’t what will you guys be able to do they said nothing and I said what do you mean nothing he abused of his power of being the host and it’s not even about the money anymore for you guys to not even penalize him or not take down his Airbnb is unfair. Their customer service is a joke and will do absolutely nothing for the guest if you run into a problem they will not respond and if you call them all they know how to say is we have to make a case. Customer service will do absolutely nothing at all.

Their customer service is a never ending black hole... apparently there’s some department... “Trust and Safety”... that can help solve my problem. However I’m convinced at this point is doesn’t exist!! Headed to the internet and social media websites to see if there was ways other people have had success getting issues solved... a lot of very frustrated customers out there, all given the same script... and also all in search of the mysterious Trust and Safety department. Also discovered a lot of people posting about accounts being hacked and emails changed right around the same time as mine... maybe some sort of system wide hack?... luckily nothing has been charged on my bank cards, unfortunately seems like others have had reservation charged to their cards because of the hack. I don’t book with them often enough, so losing me as a customer probably won’t matter to them. But hopefully someone reading this review will change their mind about using AirBnB. And I’m a voter in San Francisco, and will be paying close attention to any Airbnb related measures on future ballots. Also... I’ve been on hold while I write this review while the customer service person “checks something else”... I’ve called enough times already to know that there is nothing this person can do, other than elevate my issue to “urgent”... usually I just ask them to mark down that I’ve called (again) and unless they can give me a progress update, inform me of any activity on my account, freeze/cancel my account or!!!!! Connect me with this “Trust and Safety” dept., I would prefer not to be put on hold again. Sometimes I really throw them off and ask what they will “check” while they put me on hold... um um um just the umm I want to check umm."

That actually went fine. Booked a location for a business trip the night before the trip and was counting on having a place to stay. No notifications in the app but an email that ended up in my spam folder wanted another photo of me. I submitted another photo (when I figured out what they wanted when the app showed my trip as pending and waiting on the host to respond, yet contacting the host directly, he had not received anything about my stay from Airbnb) apparently right on the 12 hour window you have to respond to such requests and they canceled my reservation for me, just the same. So with nowhere else to stay I just booked a hotel and have decided to not risk it again. They already had a photo of my government ID which also has my photograph on it. In trying to make it a social app and pretending that additional photos are required for security they make it less palatable to use. I honestly don’t trust their ability to keep my information secure because I anticipate they will be one of the line of companies that are constantly reporting breaches and the loss of customers’ personal data with no consequence or real penalties put upon them due to their negligence. Regardless, I have just deleted my ID from them and I’m deleting the app. Again, great idea but the way they are trying to operationalize it left me without a place to stay after my plane had landed in a foreign city."

5027,Haleykr,"May 8, 2019",1,"CAUTION: HOSTS CAN CANCEL WITH NO RECOURSE! I had a wonderful time for my first Airbnb stay. But the second one I booked had red flags from the get go. I messaged the host and got my reservation confirmed, but I never heard back from the host. A month later I messaged the host and never got a response back. I checked on the status of my trip and it said that it was still confirmed but the host had deleted the listing. I called customer service to get a full refund due to feeling that I was being lead to believe that a place was available when it wasn’t. The customer service rep told me that sometimes hosts take listings down when they’re fully booked up and if I wanted to cancel I’d only get half my refund. So I decided to just stick it out and hope for the best. Sure enough it’s now a month before my trip and Airbnb contacts me to say my host canceled because they no longer had the place available (there’s a huge event in Montreal when we plan on going and I can almost guarantee I was canceled on so that they could get a reservation that would pay more) and that I’d get a full refund. The full refund is great and all, but I’m now forced to pay double what I would have paid for the Airbnb because all the hotel prices have risen. Airbnb tried sending me three crappy listings that didn’t even compare to the place I booked. How is there no recourse for hosts who cancel on customers, but yet I would have had to lose 50% of the money I already paid for the place if I canceled?! And now I can’t even leave a review for this host to warn others of her. This would NEVER happen with a hotel and I can safely say I will never use Airbnb again and I will make sure to tell everyone I know to never use your platform until this issue is fixed. Despicable!"
5028,Airbnb is the worst!,"April 27, 2020",1,"Stealing money from people during the coronavirus Airbnb is the worst company I have ever had to deal with. Every place I stayed at I had an issue with them. First I booked an apartment for 1 week in NYC and the price was well over 4K and we get there and there is no furniture in the entire apartment. I call Airbnb they do nothing. Second place I book in San Francisco the entry way to the apartment was covered in police tape like someone was just murdered there. I call Airbnb and they do nothing. I book a 3 month stay at a place in Bali and paid for the first month upfront. But due to the coronavirus and flights being canceled we had to leave after first month. We talked to the host and he said this was no problem and he contacted Airbnb. After speaking with a manager he had said that the reservation was successfully canceled and I didn’t owe anything further on the reservation. I had locked my debit card just in case and sure enough the very next day I get a message saying that Airbnb was trying to charge me extra money on that reservation. I immediately called Airbnb and they tried to tell me that I owed that extra money but luckily since I record every conversation and take pictures of every message from Airbnb due to past experiences I had proof that I did not owe a dime. They said someone would call me back to fix it. I wait a week no call, I call back same deal. This goes on for one month. I finally tell them to get someone on the line right now and that person says I owe the extra charge and then quickly changes his answer after I tell him I have all this proof that I don’t. So he tells me that the charge will be canceled and I would not be getting charges to my card any further and that I was ok to start using my card. So after I hung up with him I unlocked my card to buy food with and not even 3 hours later they charge my account the fraudulent extra charge on the reservation that they tacked on after the reservation was canceled. From what I am hearing and reading online is that I am not the only one that is getting there money stolen from Airbnb. I heard they are also stealing money from the nurses and doctors that are trying to save lives during this pandemic. Worst company ever!"

I found one that AirBnB listed at $600 a month for my 3.5 month stay, which was perfect since I would be relying on my VA benefits for income. After paying the deposit plus first full month, I thought everything was good to go. The homeowners were amazing hosts and my stay was wonderful, until the VA’s computer glitch caused me to never receive payment. I gave the homeowner advanced notice that I would no longer be able to stay, since I was unable to pay for the second month. He told me he completely understood, not to worry, and I could stay one extra week to help me find a new place. Then AirBnB contacts me that I owe them $600 because I stayed an extra 5 days. I explained the situation and my discussion with the homeowner. I inquired as to why it was going to be $600 when it was supposed to be $600 a month to begin with. She refused to give me an itemized explanation of the charges even after I asked several times, and simply said “I apologize you had a miscommunication  with the homeowner.” I was unable to pay anything because of the VA’s payment glitch so she deactivated my account (making me unable to contact the homeowners for clarification) and charged me the full amount anyway, causing me even more extreme financial hardship. I ended up living out of my car for a month and a half until the VA rectified the payment situation. I emailed back and forth multiple times trying to understand why there was no communication between AirBnB and the homeowners or even at least an itemized list of charges. I will never use AirBnB again. The situation involving my income was out of anyone’s control, but the way it was handled by customer service was appalling and stressful."

I said I don’t want a refund, in fact I need that money to stay with the host, to hold my reservation. She argued that my December reservation already had a paid deposit on the 2nd of September. Impossible because I made it 2 weeks after that. I tried to explain the reason for the 2 deposits was because i had initially booked one night and added a second (both for November back to back) and that’s what the 2 deposits on that day reflected, not the December reservation. She told me I was wrong and I was the one confused. I told her politely that I did not feel she was understanding what I was trying to explain to her. (She wasn’t even trying to understand my perspective) and when I asked if I could try and speak with somebody else she flat out told me I could not and that everybody would tell me the same thing. Worst customer service experience of my life. To know that what I’m saying is correct and to aggressively be told I am wrong- totally uncool. Vacations supposed to be fun not stressful !"

5065,MarcoTheTruth,"August 15, 2018",1,"APP TRIES TO STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!! I was using Airbnb for a while & right when I got comfortable, I put Airbnb gift cards on my account. Airbnb then deactivated my account without telling me anything except that it was because of “Criminal Backgrounds Match” and said “We cannot explain why”. I don’t even know what that means. What criminal backgrounds match if I don’t have a criminal record? So my account has been deactivated right after I put almost a thousand dollars in Airbnb gift cards on my account. They’ve promised me my money back countless times but never made one attempt to pay me my money back. They have no customer service person you can talk to concerning real technical issues. Instead you have to wait on a mystery department to email you with no outline of when the emails will come. They basically tell you (the customer), (the person who’s money they have) that there’s nothing you can do but wait on month apart emails from Airbnb’s mystery department (which almost never comes). The customer service they do provide can’t do anything but forward your problem to the mystery department. They are very rude and will hang up in your face once they feel they’ve got their point across. I don’t have my money back because Airbnb does not want to give me my money back. Anyone thinking of using this app, do not use it unless your willing to lose the money you put on here. It’s really a gamble. There are a few more apps on here that provide housing services but are way more professional and functional."

I lost sleep that first night and had to work that following morning.

I have yet to hear from the Airbnb as to why they’d canceled my reservation and left us stranded at the last very moment in Hawaii!! First time I tried the service there was an entire mix up with communication, I was so frustrated I canceled  so the company  offered me a voucher to try them. I wanted a positive experience!  So I did try them again and booked two places in Maui, months in advance. All was confirmed. The first place in Piai was fine, but we had NO hot water. Okay, things like that happen, and the owner said he would discount our rate thru Airbnb. The owner was very responsive and we kept in contact because he was not able fix his water heater until we left. From there, we headed into a remote area of the island with no cell service  for a few days. Before leaving I had contacted the owner in Kehie location and he was non responsive. Finally, after getting back into civilization that had cell service  I texted him thru the Airbnb app a couple more times and let him know our arrival time was about an hour away and I needed to get key information. Finally, frustrated and no contact, this owner told me my reservation was cancelled! WHAT? WHEN?  Airbnb canceled the day we left the first place and from there we went off the grid visiting remote areas of the island. We were stuck with no where to stay after being on the road for hours! We weren’t legit? Our room was canceled? Of course there was no way to call Airbnb, my only option was to write to their help center, which I did, and Airbnb NEVER even contacted me and it’s been 5 days ago since this happened. I HAVE LEFT MY PERSONAL CELL, they have my credit card info, my email, but not a peep! ATTENTION: People travel into remote areas without cell service and like myself have a confirmed reservations to be sure we have a place to sleep! AIRBNB canceled on the Monday (as we were leaving one of their clients homes) and we were gone already off the grid and I still have not heard a word from airbnb even 5 days after this incident and they were contacted by me! BEWARE THIS COULD HAPPEN  WITH YOUR RESERVATION!  One very unhappy customer! Twice now!"

5093,Hitesh2288,"October 21, 2018",1,"Beware of hidden clauses to rip you off We booked an apartment in NYC for our thanksgiving vacation trip using airbnb. The one we wanted was unavailable, so we went with the second best option, especially because the cancellation policy was moderate saying “Free cancellation for 48 hours”. The next day, luckily our first choice became available. So, we booked that and cancelled the earlier one. However, airbnb was keeping the $50 service fee. On calling customer care, we were told of a hidden clause you’ll find if you go to “Read more about the policy” and then go to “Get full details” that says : “Separately, if a guest cancels a reservation that overlaps with any part of an existing reservation, we won’t refund the Airbnb service fee if they decide to cancel.” The CS rep said the way to go around this hidden clause is to first cancel the existing booking and then book the new one! WOW - needless to say we were blown away! They have already charged us service fee in the other booking too. This feels like dealing with a cheap totally untrustworthy company who will use hidden clauses and details to rip you off. Why was this clause so hidden, why would they penalise cancellations if we have another reservation on their site, and how is booking second reservation and cancelling first one different from doing this the other way around when both actions are done together under a couple of minutes! This was not at all what I expected from airbnb - some of my friends even work for them in their SF office. My faith in this company is totally shaken - in conversations with their customer reps to see if this can be resolved. Will update the review with how this goes."

5110,Lesley2222,"December 6, 2017",1,"Nonexistent Customer Service There are a lot of issues with prices fluctuating on listings - even when doing searches seconds apart and with the same travel dates AND WHEN BOOKING. Found a listing in Miami that I wanted to book for NYE, put in my travel dates and it said $88/night. Wonderful, I thought. Went through the booking process (which though I can appreciate the safety aspect of verifying my identity, hindsight it made the process more frustrating since it was a waste of my time), got to the end to confirm my booking, and magically the listing price increased to $219/night. Confused and frustrated, I went to the chat group with Roechelle. I had submitted screenshots of the problem and explained the situation. I was provided a blanket response that didn’t even relate to my concern. I re-explained myself, and was told “can you tell me the name of the property”. Despite this being viewable in the pictures i submitted, i conveyed the information to her. She responded with “yes, i found the property and it’s a dynamic listing, so prices vary based on dates/demand”. Again, that wasn’t my concern/question, and it doesn’t take a customer service rep to make that deduction. So i re-explained myself (for the third time) and got this response: “sorry you’re confused about the listing prices. Thank you and let me know if i can answer any other question”, and though I don’t work in customer service, even I know that it’s against best practice to elude to the customer that they’re wrong. Also, Roechelle - I HAD DOCUMENTATION,  and you didn’t even answer my first question. Yet I was the one who was confused? I concluded the chat with “No, I’m not confused. There is a problem with the methodology of the listings. Since you’re not able to help, please cancel my Airbnb account and I’ll give my business to your competitor.” My Airbnb account was cancelled (without email notification, or a response confirming this would take place), so I have since deleted the app, downloaded Home Away instead, and I will not recommend Airbnb to friends or family based on this poor experience."

Honestly, before you go ahead & book with these people, think to yourself for a minute, how do you know what kind of person the host is? How do you know what kind of person the boarder is? How do you know what kind of person the room mates are? YOU DON'T. We stayed at this seemingly nice little place with deceptive pictures ( the room barely fit the bed in it), we were told we would have 2 male roommates, by the 3rd day staying there we weren't sure exactly HOW many roommates we had, we know it was more than 4. 4 single male room mates who hated children and according to the hosts, constantly complained to them if my child so much as giggled. One of them being an alcoholic. The alcoholic would puke on the kitchen floor, complain about my baby making any noise at all, talk down to my husband all day while I was at work, eventually I came home 3 days before our stay was up and the drunk had accused us of taking his clothes, like uhhhh dude I've been at work, my husband is overweight, the drunk was the size of a twig, just no. We ignored it as normal civilized people would do, because, he's drunk... and around midnight that night they had a ""house meeting"" with the hosts about how to get us out because we have a baby and the guy was still all drunk ranting about clothes. So then apparently according to the hosts, AIRBNB told the hosts to SEARCH through OUR THINGS!!! After they searched and found nothing, we had enough and left. THIS ALL HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT. On top of all of this, the hosts contact us several weeks later requesting large amounts of money for the strangest things ever. Like having the living room deep cleaned... we never even entered their living room. Not to mention during our stay, the young roommate would bring over his several sex-friends and leave condoms on the floor of the bathroom. It was a filthy environment with mold growing in the toilets and we never ever should have done this app, never will again. It's actually quite traumatizing seeing ""Airbnb"" anywhere."

Split payments going away. 1099s going to listing owner causing tax nightmares, especially for co-hosts managing properties for owners who aren’t tech savvy or accounting savvy. New 4.8 review criteria. One low rating, even if it’s not justified, throws you out of super-host status. Multiple big changes happening during peak season (August!) with very little time for hosts and co-hosts to figure out work arounds. 5 weeks notice... really? We had to put the listing in my name for our work around regarding the payments and tax issues. Now my daughter has lost all of her great travel reviews because it went with the listing. Shouldn’t travel reviews follow the person? That’s pretty much a no brainer. I have never been to all the countries she has, yet the reviews say I have. What a failure in software that is! Totally unacceptable. Certainly many steps backwards for AirBnB. Not the industry disruptor you use to be. I scoured the message boards to try and find something positive with all these changes and nothing but unhappy hosts, co-hosts and owners out there.

For starters my hosts named Kim, who offers a bungalow in Sarasota Florida, was terrible. She didn’t communicate well at all acts as though she sits on a high horse. My friend and I booked her location for a week for our birthday and we drove over 14 hrs to come to a home that was a disaster. There was a list of things wrong... pee stains on the bed, stains of food and wet buts from the pool on furniture, old dirty mattress and pillows in the garage/laundry room, clutter everywhere, old food in the fridge, the appliances such as the fridge and dishwasher was disgusting and dirty, the floor boards were torn apart and on the verge of breaking (but was covered with an area rug to hide it), the pool was filthy and obviously wasn’t cleaned before from prior guest, the lawn and pool are was not up kept, extra sheets provided smelt bad and weren’t clean. Overall a disgusting place. My friend I canceled our reservation through Airbnb support and requested a refund we got a refund of $280 for canceling but the additional $500+ we spent was in question and had to be discussed with the host. Our host denied the request and the support team basically said sorry about your luck and gave us a $100 off coupon for another location that expires. Mind you that we only have 1 more day on our vacation, we’ve been dealing with terrible people and support for 3 days... it’s ridiculous. Airbnb is a scam and a waist of time.

I was disappointed in my experience as early in my stay I found a mouse running through the apartment while I was chilling out on  the sofa. I informed immediately the super host (whose name I keep secret), and kindly asked to be able to leave earlier, given the situation. As a former DC resident I am well aware of the city rodent problem and I was ready to be accomodating. I was expecting some understanding from the host that this type of things can happen. The host responded the day after denying any problem and refusing to let me go early with a refund for the remaining days, unless they could immediately rebook, a risk that at first I did not want to take. I was therefore obliged to remain an additional night, with a new visit from the uninvited rodent guest. After trying usuccessfully to resolve the situation with aribandb and the host, I decided to leave without any refund, and go to stay with a friend who kindly hosted me. You may not be so lucky if you don’t know anyone in town. The cherry on the cake? Airbnb censured my review (this one), the only way I had to share my experience and alert other guests ... which totally defeats the purpose of sharing reviews, even the bad ones. Lesson learnt: if you find yourself in this situation, beware that if the host denies that there is any issue you will not be accomodated or supported, even if you provide some self-collected evidence (pictures of droppings, I challenge anyone to take a selfie with a mouse!). Better to call yourself a pest control firm to make the assessment in your presence (180dollars), even before telling the host about the problem."

Although it might appear that people are renting out extra space in their home that would otherwise be vacant, and that you’ll get a “local experience” if you take their deal, there’s more going on here. In essence, they are another capitalist wedge into destroying civil society, putting unregulated hotels into situations where nobody wanted or expects one. Imagine if your nextdoor condo neighbor was running one of these AirBNB hotels, leaving keys under mats and sharing your security codes with the world. Travelers like to have noisy fun at times- who handles security- the police? Travelers can tend to destroy things - who handles those repairs- your condo association (paid by you)? "

It had nothing to do with the company, but the host who had misconstrued their listing. We showed up and it was absolutely unpresentable. There was clutter everywhere, the place was dusty, the pool didn't work nor did it have any A/C in the room (we were in Vegas so it's HOT). We took pictures and set them side by side to the ones on the listing and they were unrecognizable to each other. You would of thought it was a different place. We knew of the cancellation policy and since we were going to be stuck here for a month and spent almost $1,000, we were determined to get our money's worth. "

5360,Ugh iPhone,"July 6, 2015",5,"My favorite app!! I'm obsessed! Such a cool way to travel, the app works amazing if you utilize it correctly. You can filter to fit your needs, for example if you only want to see listings where you get the whole house to yourself or if you want certain amenities like a pool or hot tub. As for a previous comment about what kind of people would let someone crash on their couch for $60, why are you even staying at those homes in the first place if all you have is judgment for them? Oh I bet you didn't! So you're judging off of your discomfort level alone, rude. This is an app for people that love to travel and be kind to strangers. You can read reviews about all the places and people hosting you, and you often don't have to meet the hosts at all or only for very briefly to check in. If you do get lucky enough to spend time with some of them you will get great suggestions on food and places to see while you're away from home, which is my preference of traveling I love to try the locals' favorites and the hole in the wall spots no one knows about! I've met some great people through this app and definitely stayed in some amazing places that I'll be returning to, that are much cooler AND cheaper than hotels. Awesome experiences at AirBnB!"
5361,Tanner Blount,"August 1, 2015",3,Could be better So the app still glitches and will not display phone numbers or address. After guests booked.. Also I don't understand why you can't go to the guests profile straight from the inquiry they send you. Example just recieved a booking request. I click on the profile. The person doesn't have a picture. And I can't get to their profile to at least read about them and see stats. And if they did it doesn't let you scroll up to see their full picture.

5363,Professorshours,"June 6, 2016",5,"Great App for staying on top of My Business This is a great little app for me to keep up with reservation requests and inquiries for my Airbnb business. I have five rooms and occasionally try to rent them as entire package or a room here and there. I love that the app lets me see the individual listings as well as incoming messages. Several things are still missing from this app that I have to go upstairs to the big Computer on my desk in order to accomplish. I love the multi calendar on the big computer. I love that I can use canned messages on my big computer. So the app leaves a bit to be desired. But the main function of quickly's getting a notification that there is a reservation pending or an inquiry has been sent to me, it's more than an offsetting the limitations and capabilities of the app. If I had to do everything on the app, I would be only three star happy. But the features of Airbnb continue to evolve and they're pretty stable. I never have to delete and reload this app so for me that's a good thing."
5364,Jackopek,"June 11, 2016",4,"Great! Nearly Perfect!, but 2 improvements to make Airbnb is such a brilliant idea. I haven't stayed in a hotel in 2 years thanks to Airbnb. It's much more relaxing."
5365,juanitamwilliams,"June 26, 2016",5,"Easy to use As a host, I use the app for just about everything. It is easy to update my listing and calendar, communicate with guests as well as just about anything else necessary. As a traveler, I have used it to search, book, communicate and make changes. I find it super easy and if I can't do something through the app, it gives me the phone number to call.  As both a host and traveler, I have been extremely happy with Airbnb and their agents. Even when I had a booking go south fast, they were helpful and very, very nice.  It did not get resolved 100% in my favor but a through investigation was performed, resulting in the fairest decision possible. TO RESPOND TO ANOTHER REVIEWER about fake reviews. Unless a friend books my space and pays for the reservation (including all cleaning fees), they cannot leave a review. Also, both parties have to leave a review (after the completed stay) before either is posted. That would be a lot of work to conjure up some nice words. Possible, but seems like a stretch. It might be that guests are afraid to leave honest reviews. This should not be the case since the Airbnb review process requires both parties leave a review (within two weeks) before either is posted."
5366,Nikkinouse1969,"July 10, 2016",4,"Love it but agreed it needs some work This is a great app and I love how I can manage this one as people in my age group typically rent as opposed to another older site my aunt manages to get the older crowd who is used to renting in that site.  My complaints are the lack of customer service, communication and intuitiveness.  The outlets for your Customer service makes me feel like I'm lost in the woods, but an email usually arrives within 48 hrs.. The communication is lacking around your software upgrades, we should be notified via email what they are- what we can expect- and when it will be released. A beta pricing section that is fine, a group of people should be enlisted if they want to. Don't release it and basically enforce it... :/. This made my prices have automatic discounts that I don't do during summer months. And it took effect 1/2 hour to find where I put my initial pricing in the first place. Additionally why didn't my initial pricing not carry over to next year automatically? I should be able to adjust if I wanted to increase/decrease etc. but for it to be blank isn't acceptable.  I wouldn't have known this if a woman hadn't inquired about 2 weeks. Next year - her total came to half of what I charge! That made me log in and investigate. Not cool."
5367,GyspyCloud,"March 3, 2017",1,"Perfect in Every Way I left my previous Rating below so you can see what a Drastic change in opinion I have had since the latest update a couple days ago. Nothing makes sense, the format on the computer is so different I have to relearn everything all over again. the bookings, listings and messages are all jumbled in one place together and you have to scroll through Every history to find your next guest. The calendar works differently and I am making booking mistakes due to misunderstandings You no longer have one click access to the guests phone, the app just keeps redirecting you back to your message box. I have missed guest bookings because I can not find the request information. You still can't contact Airbnb in anyway, just keep getting redirected throughout the ""help"" files. I not only Dislike everything about the new update but I have deleted it and will not be using it until the correct some changes. Absolutely Everything was perfect about the app before and now I can't stand to use it from frustration. I am one unhappy Host at the moment. "
5368,Baby Llama Drama,"October 19, 2017",1,"Hosts are swindlers and liars My experience trying to find a place to stay near an event has been terrible.  People do not keep up with their profiles and they shouldn't be allocated an entire 24 hrs for requests 2 days out. We were stood up for approx 5 homes and didn't receive responses from the majority of those. People who list air mattresses as ""beds"" are misleading and they should have standardized questions to tell the entire truth in their posts.  The mandatory profile setting should explain the bed situation and photos which show the entire layout not just a random lawn photo.  Also for profiles with no activity for a month they should be automatically disenrolled. One lady moved from her home and didn't take the profile down therefore wasting our time.  All of the others ""failed to update their availability"" therefore wasting even more time on a short turnaround booking. And the price gouging has been disgusting to deal with; it should be regulated so people cannot take advantage of events in town. Robbing people of good money for some shabby 1 bedroom apt is appaling. At this point we have no place to stay and I probably won't use Air BnB again if standardization isn't implemented. I used this service in the beginning when it wasn't a forum for money grubbing swindlers but this has turned into another example of greed and a good service becoming ""commercialized."""

5370,Lostomatos,"November 21, 2010",5,"Fun and Functional Wow!  This app is phenomenal for cruising AirBNB.  The presentation is fun and colorful and makes browsing an enjoyable experience.  I found myself browsing through their special categories such as ""I'm on a boat"" (places on boats), ""Trees & Zzzzs"" (tree houses) and Ye Own Castle (Castles!) just for fun.  I like how reviews of the hosts are easy to find and pictures are easy to browse through thanks to the iPhones ability to scroll through pics with the swipe of a finger.  The best feature is the ability to let the app use my location (with permission) allowing me to see listings nearby integrated with googlemaps.  No need to type in my address, thus making the app faster and easier to use than via that standard website.  I was sitting at home doing this so it was interesting to see what was nearby but I could see this feature being ultra useful while traveling.  Everything just feels snappy and fast and of course the presentation is gorgeous.  For a product catered to the traveler it only makes sense to use the app!  5 stars for fun and function."

5372,Vanessa1221,"June 2, 2015",2,"AirBNB STOLE OUR MONEY This company isn't run legally. They follow protocol when it's financially convenient to them. Their system faulted and 'didn't record' my tax ID info and they helped themselves to a $500 fee that I was unaware of until it was all processed and 'too late' to reverse. Then guest broke things in my home, we took a security deposit as usual. Now that I put in a claim, the guest (as expected, went silent), I involve AirBNB, they lowball me on the amount, send me documents to sign if I AGREE with their amount, which I didn't sign because I didn't agree to it, the guest comes alive, agrees to the lowball amount and AirBNB closes the case. They send me the low amount without my consent. I send an email and they say that they don't need me to agree to that amount, they only need the guest to agree. Umm, the guest is the one who stole personal/sentimental things from my home because AirBNB makes you a promise to protect you. Well, it's not true!!! They don't follow their own guidelines. This company is a SCAM and I will make sure to post this message across every social medial platform available to me to ensure no one is aware of your bad business practice and can be prepared to have their home violated if they use AirBNB. Nothing gets resolved. What a scam!!!!! Beware!!!!!!!!!"

Apple Pay works well in other apps and at brick-and-mortar locations. This issue was persistent across my iPhone 6 and iPad Pro. I ultimately used my PayPal account successfully. Second issue was that when I was asked to provide identity verification, the app would accept the photo of the front of the ID, but it would not accept the photo of the back of the ID. I used multiple flow paths to come at the issue and ultimately was successful on my iPhone. I had tried on my iPad as well. Einstein's definition of insanity had already been met when it worked."
5374,Cheetowin,"September 1, 2016",1,"Horrible Customer Service with NO Protection for Guests!!! Don't use this app! It's not safe! I stayed at a place with a friend that had a long history and all good reviews! We were made to feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome throughout our stay. My friend, who was African American, felt discriminated against and felt like their demeanor was different towards him then it was towards me. Afterwards they left me a slanderous review with prejudicial statements. I reported this to Airbnb and my case manager constantly blew me off, refused to take the review down, and refused to do anything about the emotional abuse we experienced. All of their customer service representatives (except one) were extremely rude to me, lied to me about promises to call back and follow-up, and hung up on me. When I requested to speak to a supervisor they refused. When I asked to report my case manager because it appears that she wasn't doing her job, they wouldn't let me. When I requested a new case manager they refused. I was forced to delete my account. It appears that they have little to no policies in place to protect their guests against a case manager who isn't properly investigating their case. If you look at their Facebook page you will see lots of posts by people complaining of similar and varied situations. Very unreliable! Stick with other services, their are better ones out there!"

5376,majorsteel,"April 13, 2017",3,"Problems With Limited Connectivity My family and I just completed a 2-week trip throughout Italy staying entirely in AirBnB's. The results and experience were great, but there were many times the app left us frustrated. In many locations we had very limited connectivity - 3G and EVDO mostly. Under those conditions, the app was very difficult to reliably use. There does not appear to be any caching of messages so there were times when critical information that hosts had sent us - e.g. labyrinthian walking directions in Venice - was inaccessible. The app also does not always recover from being off the network - there were times when the ""Network Error"" message wouldn't go away even when we reconnected, and we had to force quit the app to get it to refresh. We also missed a message from one of our hosts who had to change our meeting location - it was delivered to the app almost 45 minutes after she sent it even though we were connected (over 3G) the entire time. Luckily, we eventually found her. Given that the AirBnB service supports and facilitates traveling in out-of-the-way places, the app really needs to better handle situations where the user has limited and unreliable connectivity."
5377,xo_meckitah,"June 4, 2017",3,"Good when you're happy with your reservation, terrible if you encounter a problem Traveled around Europe extensively with friends for the last six months and was happy with Air BNB until we encountered an issue with a host. Our Madrid stay lied about their location (they were 2 hours away from the airport, which is outside the Madrid already but said they were close to city center) but refused to give us a refund. After spending three hours on the phone, Air BNB did NOTHING about it (a total waste of our time). This host LIED about where they were located - grounds for a refund according to Air BNB policy - and we were told nothing could be done. What's worse was that our stay in Madrid was during Holy Week... so every hotel in city center was booked and there were no hostel rooms available. We finally found a hotel on the outer rim of the city but of course, it took us almost 40 minutes to get where we needed to go each day and our stay cost us a fortune on top of what we already spent... For the most part, I've been really happy with Air BNB accommodations but now I know that if I encounter an issue, I'm S.O.L. and need to have a back-up plan because they don't help. Not sure I'll be using them in the future when traveling."

After talking with the owner he said I could take up the week after as well with my family. their rules listing stated they only wanted a certain number of guests was because they didn't want parties there but accepted my kids. So I was told to cancel my reservation and book both weeks. Well in doing so I was charged another Air BnB fee of 67$. I called customer service to ask to cancel the first fee because all this happened in the span of 30 minutes. It was an honest goof up. Even the owner didn't know this would happen. But customer service couldn't do a thing to help me and hosed me. ""Rules is Rules"" So I was charged a double booking fee. They filed an email with the main office and I never got any response after. It's not like I tried to cancel within days of my reservation. This reservation was weeks in advance. I'm very disappointed with this greedy maneuver on Air BnB's part and think they need to do a better job in preventing this in the future as well follow up with complaints sent out by their phone service. Which makes me think they hire people that work at home. (No biggie there) but follow up."
5381,Shouldude,"July 26, 2015",1,"Horrible Customer Service Airbnb has put us through the most ridiculous, arduous, and frustrating experience when we were trying to book rooms for a trip to Europe. My friend and I tried to book half on my account and half on his. Once we had all of them accepted and booked, my friend got an email that all of his reservations were cancelled due to the fact that he is 17, even though that was not made clear when signing up, one would have had to read through all of the terms and conditions.  Instead of allowing us to transfer all of his bookings to my account, they instead deleted all reservations and did not help us to rebook them. When I tried to rebook them on my account, all of the places declined my reservation because Airbnb had told them that my friend's account was cancelled for ""Security Reasons."" It was ridiculous that they did not tell the listers the real reason why his account was suspended. Then when we tried to call Airbnb to rectify the situation they would not transfer the reservations to my account and told us that someone would call us by the end of the day, which they haven't. This has been some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced and I likely will never use Airbnb again."

It’s a REQUIREMENT to have an (Active) social media and provide your passport photo in addition to the last four digits of your social security number ON TOP OF PROVIDING A VALID CREDIT CARD to book a room?!?!? So now we are literally providing them with our ENTIRE Identity and spent the last hour trying to figure out why the site isn’t verifying… Why? Because the SITE IS BROKEN. So… Why exactly in the FINE PRINT does it say “It’s not an endorsement or guarantee of someone’s identity”? Yet you request all form of identification and payment.. on top of a Broken site which frustrates me even more. Guess what a regular site requires to book a location? a valid ID and a credit CARD OR JUST A CREDIT CARD. Don’t go spewing trust when you yourself doesn’t even believe it. This application as a whole is garbage. They want all form of your identity before booking a room and say they’ll keep it safe yet I don’t believe a single word of it. This is a mockery of all other type of payment like Apple Pay, Paypal etc. etc. Don’t bother fixing it because it’ll stay broken. Good Day."
5383,B West Family,"May 26, 2016",4,"Needs some improvements for guests All in all, it's a pretty good app but it does need some tweaking on the guest side of things. The inbox shows your communications with hosts, but it can be hard to figure out which properties you are looking at  - at a glance. Often, we are contacting numerous hosts for the same holiday (as suggested), but when looking at the inbox, it only shows the name of the host you are communicating with and it can be very confusing - it takes extra steps to click on the message, then try to figure out which property that manager/owner/host is related to. There needs to be some consistency - Instead of just showing the name of the host, it should show the name of the property it relates to - it would help TONS if you also would give each property a property number. It makes for ease of sharing basic info with companion travelers and would make referencing specific properties so much easier.  Sometimes the ""title"" of the property listed is different from the ""name"" of the property. I just find that any help in consistency would make it much easier for the person searching."

On over five occasions now payments have shown to not go through creating useless friction between you and your host. (Emphasis on that because it's airbnbs fault but instead of Airbnb helping resolve issues you'll be the one dealing with the host and communication.)

I know that Airbnb keeps working on it so that gives me faith that they'll just keep making it better.

The people that I have met have been awesome and I have found it easier to travel and to make money off of the assets I possess. However anytime I have had issues with processing payments, using gift cards, or this application I have had terrible customer service. When I call it takes about an hour to get anyone on the phone and when I do get them on the phone they have such an attitude and are never very helpful. When I became a super host the wait time went down significantly to just a couple minutes to get a hold of a human, however they still had a major attitude. Recently my guess and I were having issues transferring funds through the app. When I called them they basically absolved themselves of any responsibility for the usability of the application at all. I could not get any confirmation that the IT team was going to receive knowledge about the issues we were having. Long story short it is good in theory however you will have to suffer through the poor app and customer service!"
5388,Vickykallunki,"June 3, 2017",5,"To My Fellow Travelers I have been a Airbnb traveler since 2012. If you want a slice of American hospitality in every possible way check out this ap. The host have a wonderful diversity of lifestyles that they love sharing with their guests. Where the web site can bog down because of it's popularity, the ap is always a breeze to use. Here are some traveling tips..read the reviews and host bios to find the best value and the best match. Don't count you least expensive or best last minute, but if you are booking in route you can usually find something that beats a hotel. Star ratings and super host status is based on the hosts; look for clean and friendly hosts that match your visiting style. Be willing to detour for a special experience. Look out for in property host who only want the profits and not the guests. A great way to weed them out is to ask for information before your stay.   Ask your host for touring information. They will help you discover their community's best spots and hidden away local experiences. Happy traveling."
5389,BrkPie,"June 27, 2017",1,"BOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK My friend and I used airbnb for a week as we travelled the East Coast (6 places total) and we will never use them again. We were surprised by how some of the places we stayed at had such good reviews, which we thought were highly inaccurate when we got to the places. The breaking point was when we arrived at a home and the windows (easily accessible) had busted locks that didn't work. The neighborhood looked rough, so we looked up crime statistics; we were staying in a town with a crime rate 120% above the national rate, and the area we were staying in was the most dangerous of the town. I tried to resolve with the host and then called Airbnb as their refund policy states that if an Airbnb is ""unsafe"", you get a refund. Airbnb offered me a 50% refund which I told them no. The host even agreed that we should get a full refund (he wasn't aware of the broken windows), but they are dragging their feet. It's been a week and I've had to call twice for updates. Book at your own risk! Also, we're from Chicago, so we have a pretty good idea of what a good vs dangerous area of town looks like. I'm appalled that I'm even having to fight them on this refund. The house is not secured! How could we feel safe sleeping or leaving our belongings there during the day?"
5390,BNKKXU,"August 15, 2012",5,"People are incompetent I love this app and air BnB in general, I've also NEVER have had a major problem with the app crashing, NEVER! My guess for the swarms of people who have problems either 1.) Have too many open apps 2.) Have too much 💩 on their device in general 3.) Are impatient... Yes the app has crashed occasionally, but mainly because my old 3GS is barely hanging in there and this app requires a fair amount of memory to run it. I can't stand people who give apps 1 star for apps crashing, 95% of the time it's human error on their part."
5391,Moosjenkins,"December 8, 2013",5,"I hate to Admit it I write this review reluctantly. Not because AirBNB is not a good service, in fact it's quite the opposite. It has been so good for us that we are booking our home about 15 nights a month! And we haven't advertised! "

I find it to be extremely buggy - crashing, not saving reviews, and to solicit help b/c of the bugginess is also not very easy. To be fair, once I did figure out how to lodge a complaint, someone did get back to me very quickly, but one would hope that complaints and questions arising out of frustration would not be an issue to begin with. But I have hope that improvements will eventually be made."
5395,kimnted,"September 20, 2016",2,"After reviewing I will be deleting this app This app is linked to airbnb. We had several difficulties making a reservation and ultimately wound up frustrated and had no reservation. The host seemed nice enough but all difficulties stemmed from the airbnb site. First, we found a place for 60/night but when we booked it, airbnb signed us up for 91/night... not a rate on their site. We had to have that changed but it went rather smoothly. Then, we received a confirmation but some how we didn't have a reservation. We were not ""verified"".  To do this we had to upload a drivers license... and we had to link a social media account. This is just too much information. Even with Uber, an app and service I have used and enjoyed, they supply more information about the person 'hosting'. There is really no need to link my social media to be able to make a reservation. Therefor, I will not be using this service. Ever. And John, the supervisor on the floor when I called, had very poor customer service skills. With all my frustration, he did little to help and just gave me a huge attitude. Good luck navigating this. We will find another way to find a place to stay."
5396,Miz_Lennie,"October 28, 2016",1,"Horribly glitchy for an app based service Attention HOSTS!!! Do not think for a second that when you change something on the desktop or on the app it translates to either version of the site. They have had a serious problem with the availability settings for months and have not fixed it yet. For example, if you have a different minimum days stay requirements for different months or sections of time it automatically adds a stipulation that the guest has to check in on a specific day even if that's not what you want and you keep deleting that requirement so they can check in on any day, it will just keep changing the requirement for you to show that the guest can only book if they check in on a Sunday or a Monday. And what shows up on the desktop version is also always different than what shows up in the app version. Had I known how terrible their IT was I would've never signed up to host through Airbnb, at least not with all of my properties because it actually prevents your ability to get the most bookings you can. Seriously, I don't understand how this app/website can be so terrible. Too many glitches to count but some of them are more costly than others to the host!"

I have been extremely pleased with the messaging alert system so that I am able to quickly and efficiently respond to my guests, and all inquiries. I've been using the app since June 2015, and maybe only three or four times did the alerts not come through on my iPhone, but AirBnB's response team is extremely helpful and has always responded quickly to me via their Twitter direct message system to help me rectify any issues that may present themselves. If you are a host or a guest, I highly recommend using this app (and AirBnB)! I do believe you will have a really great experience! Thank you AirBnB for being a wonderful platform for vacation travel/business travel, and opening the door up so that us hosts are able to welcome & accommodate all of these wonderful people!

(The usual moving to Hollywood story) it took maybe 10 minutes to find the perfect place in the perfect location and 7 of those minutes were just figuring out how much the app has to offer! It really tells you everything you need to know. Searching by location was easiest. Each listing has photos, house rules, amenities, parking info, everything you need to know right there. No fees, no bs, just a credit card to book the room (which we didn't have and they let us pay cash when we got there). Everyone on this site is very different and the properties and locations are endless. I just talked to a couple of girls who used the same app all over the country. If we did not find this app we would have been lost to say the least! Thank you for this app!"
5401,Lady Eine,"May 29, 2014",3,"Airbnb takes your money and glitches Airbnb takes your money as soon as you book a place even if you're not approved by the host. If the host denies your reservation Airbnb takes up to 3-5 days to give your money back. Airbnb app doesn't tell you this until after you book your stay. Although you can find this info the FAQ section, this is not the most helpful place. Why would you know to even look this up? No other vender does it this way. Hotels will authorize your cc to make sure funds are there but don't actually remove money from your account.  This feature is very problematic bc it can tie up thousands of dollars. "
5402,YahYouBetchaa,"July 15, 2014",3,"Great website, but the app needs improvement I love AirBnB! The rooms are so much better than a hotel of that same price. However, I wish they would change some things on the app. First of all, the sliding price scale is very hard to use. I waste so much time trying to adjust that stupid thing... It's nearly impossible to set it to the exact price that I want. I'll hold my finger down and arrive at the number I want, and then when I lift my finger off the screen, it goes crazy on me and changes to a completely random number that's not even close to what I'm trying to search for. Why can't they put a box on there so you can just type in the price range you're looking for? Or, select the amount from a drop-down menu? I'm sure I'm not the only one who gets frustrated by this. Also, lately the app has been freezing on me, and the pics don't always load. One more thing- I receive messages to my phone but sometimes they won't show up in my inbox when I open the app. I really hope they fix these issues."
5403,aeh2,"March 21, 2016",2,"At least 2 significant bugs for hosts I use the app mostly for hosting, since a quick response time is critical for making sure guests will find my space when they search Airbnb (i.e. placement in search results). I've noticed two significant bugs so far with this update. First, as another reviewer notes, the ""Other Things to Note"" section of my listing does not appear when a traveler views a listing, even if the host has entered content in that section. This means guests have booked my space using the app without knowing all of the important info I include in that section. Second, I cannot turn on push notifications in the app. When I try to do so, I'm told that I have to approve push notifications in my iPhone's Settings -- but when I go to Settings, push notifications are already turned on! This is very bad because if I am out of range of cell service, but connected to wifi, I cannot get a push notification if a guest makes an inquiry. I'm very dismayed by these bugs because they affect my ability to communicate quickly and honestly with my potential and current guests."

We called to cancel a reservation a total of four times and each time we met with a different representative who we had to explain everything to from the start. This may sound whiny, but when an international call costs $1/minute and when they record everything you say in your request file, it is very frustrating. We made it farthest in this process with one representative who said he'd call the host and then call us back right after. We waited for an hour without hearing a response and then decided to call and check in on what was taking so long. The person we spoke with this time looked at the information on our file, though still asked us to repeat everything, and informed us that the person we had spoken with earlier had called the host an hour ago, the host hadn't picked up, and then the person took a break and wasn't at their desk.

I really only have one big complaint witch is that there site is not user friendly! It can be very frustrating trying to navigate it! When i needed help it took me three days of screwing around on site before i finally got a phone number from another user! When i called help like they were very helpful and resolved my issue very fast but it was quite a headache trying to get to that point! The people i spoke to were very nice and i was happy with result but wish it had not been so difficult to get help! The site needs to be more user friendly and way easier to navigate all around!! As a host i find it hard almost every time i have to use it for anything but accept or decline! My one bit of advice make site more user friendly! Wish I was booked more often as well but i am hoping with time that will happen! Other than that I'm very happy with hosting and being part of Air B&B!!
5408,Knitsen,"April 13, 2017",3,"Great app...worst update The version just before the current one worked so well: I got suggested prices even on my iPhone, the calendar was easy to use (and I have 2 guest spaces, so that's important), and the inbox/message field was straightforward. That seemed to be the plateau of goodness, because the current version just doesn't cut it. No suggested prices. Tiny calendar that's almost impossible to work with. THE WORST PART: When I decline a potential guest, I write a message first and then decline. No more. Now I'm in lock-step, walking through my reasons, then having to write the message I already wrote before the app sets me free. BUT NO! I have 3 acceptable reasons to decline. The most common one--a newbie who's given no info & has no reviews--is not among them. Beyond the app, customer service folks are less well trained & there's no auto feedback for phone calls. I get it. Progress is not always a straight line. Or maybe the IT staff is over-controlling and under-employed.  This time, progress would be a step back to the previous iteration. I hope."
5409,AnneGMcWilliams,"August 13, 2017",2,"Very inconsistent I find the Airbnb app to be so inconsistent that I only trust my reservations and communications on my personal computer or laptop. Because I like this service and use my mobile for most everything when traveling, the inconsistencies are very inconvenient. For instance: I tried to change my old mobile number to my current mobile number. My new number does appear in my profile now, however, I just got a message from Airbnb telling me they confirmed a change I just made by sending it to my old mobile number by SMS. When I tried to set up text notifications in Settings, I get error messages saying I do not have a valid phone and SMS number set up. Now, I have no way to fix this from within the app. I have to go back to my laptop to log into the web site and confirm my phone number and hope there is some kind of syncing taking place between the web site and the app. This makes me nervous about storing payment methods in the app. If I can't get a simple phone number to update, what else is going to malfunction?"
5410,Mr.K LV,"August 14, 2011",5,A must have!! I LOVE this App. I can not stress this enough!  I tell all my friends who are going to be taking a trip to make sure and check Air BNB before booking anything.  I love to get out on mini vacations and always am trying to find cool places to stay in.  Air bnb makes this sooooooo easy.  Most of the time I sit on my iPad and plan where to go next based on who has a unique cool place in the area.  I went to Milwaukee two weeks ago stayed in a nice hotel condo had a great experience so now I'm planning on going to Nashville next weekend to stay in a sweet 100 year old loft on 2nd street that is right in the middle of all the cool bars!   If I ever became a world traveler I would only use Air BNB to find private homes to stay in the deals you find can't be matched from any hotel!  I could go on for ever but then you would fall asleep and forget to download this App. DOWNLOAD IT! :-)

The screen displays on the app often make finding the 'save' option impossible -- I cannot see it.  Each screen where updates can occur should have the 'save' option in the same place. And you REALLY need a 'first time user' set of information on how Airbnb works.  An option right on the home page, so I could point a confused newbie to it, instead of taking much time to try to educate them.  I have had guests who think they can drive over to see the room.  I have had guests get really upset that I cannot speak to them. It's your job to make this work!"

In any case I decided to go ahead and quickly ran into an issue at checkout with an error stating the app was experiencing technical issues and I couldn't reserve the property I wanted. I hit the button a few times not realizing the app was actually processing my request despite the error stating it was not going through. This ended with my account being suspended for suspicious activity. I emails airbnb support with no response and finally found a phone number to call for help. There is no ETA for issue resolution if you have a problem. I'm supposed to get a call back ... someday.

I'm sorry, with people padding their online reviews left and right these days I want to have the right to back out of a deal quickly if a place isn't quite what it's made out to be! ( I don't want to have to go there just to make sure it does in deed ""smell of smoke and urine"" as some two weeks older but now buried reviews stated) I ended up eating the booking because the place had a ""flexible"" but no short notice refunding policy...

Airbnb's inventory is mostly the extra bedroom or worse living room couch, in people's subpar homes. This is like paying to crash at someone's pad. I'm staying with traditional hotel lodgings as at least there is a cancellation policy and some sort of customer expectation and level of privacy. Airbnb has a customer hotline, in case of grievances, but it's staff of 2 are both unhappy tech dropouts who are obviously unhappy with their jobs. I stayed in an airbnb ""host"" twice and both times it was exactly the type of people who would let complete strangers into their homes for $60. I can only imagine what type of desperation would let you to invite a total stranger into the intimacy of your home for less than $100. If you want minimal privacy, maximum awkwardness and uncomfortable furnishings with no quality control or customer service as recourse, then airbnb is for you."

I KNOW that I've blocked out my vacation dates. Airbnb seems to keep unblocking them.

On web, it's all in one place. Switching between hosting and traveling feels like different app designers wrote them.  Simple things like where you go to get messages are in very different places. Airbnb keeps updating, so they'll probably figure out how to do this app better, but typically they don't give any notice or guidance when making big changes. I like the service, have used it as host and guest for years. The app is handy, especially to respond to guest questions while I'm not at home."

However as primarily as a host, there are necessary functions that we like to have for example, being able to dig deeper into the ""stats"" which you can only do from the website (and even that's limited).  Another thing that would be nice is to not make folks search for a telephone number to speak with someone in case of an emergency, I had to google it!  The App works fairly well for getting bookings, reminders and the ability to communicate with your guests.  One key piece that would be nice to have, is the ability to attach emojis to messages.

They are impartial and can therefore provide comfort that they will not take ""sides"". We did have to move from our initial rental into a new one because the amenities promised were not provided.

However, I just discovered the app is lacking a major bit of info. While the additional cost per person is available on the app, nowhere does it say how many people the base price covers, After spending lots of time sorting through listings on the app, I looked at the website and found that some use 2 or 4 as the base, and some use 1!

It is great with real time notifications, but sometimes my ability to see the actual message and respond (in a timely manner) is complicated. That is, it often feels like the user interface changes somehow and I can only see a certain view of something...as result, my response time is affected & it's stressful trying to figure out where the screen I want to see actually IS! Perhaps it's user error...but I use a similar site to host dog boarding services and never have that type of issue...so I'm inclined to say it's the app. Plus, I've had some notification on my app for weeks now and I can't figure out what it is I need to review or read to get it to disappear. I hate having those little red bubbles on my apps! I'll likely delete the app & re-install to see if that works...here's hoping. Bottom line: It definitely could be better."
5438,carolinafran,"February 9, 2017",2,Average This app is limited compared to the web version. For example the web version allows a host to write and save messages that will be appropriate to send to each incoming guest. This saves a lot of thinking through the process every time. You cannot do this on the app. 
5439,Reischke,"August 25, 2017",3,"A little disappointed It's our first time using Airbnb and after looking at many great options we were excited to finally narrow it down to one. That's when the excitement went away, it was a long process of taking and retaking pictures of ID, not being able to take a selfie pic and having to download the app, and then when we paid with PayPal we were sent an email asking for several more steps to be taken. At that point I was frustrated and decided to just go with a hotel. This was a last minute trip for us, so I was not looking forward to the stress of trying to find a decent affordable hotel. The next day (today) I tried one last time to book using Airbnb, this time using a credit card (the same one linked to our PayPal account)and was successful. I appreciate security measures, but the process was more time consuming and tedious then I would have liked."

I give Airbnb 5 stars for their model to connect individuals with one another. The app works flawlessly but  is still missing a key feature for hosts: it lacks access to view and edit the calendar.

Stateside or overseas, it's my favorite site that connects me with the coolest locations to stay. And a plus, the app is just as easy as the website. I love the vacation ideas when it first opens up and the wish list function. It allows me to bum around in there anytime to see where I want to take my next trip. It's a great function to have it linked to your phone number and personal email so you have easy access to messages from hosts.

I started looking on airbnb app on my breaks at work and could barely decide from all the wonderful places. The reviews were very recent, within weeks. I inquired via the app on specifics on a few and got instant messages via text link that same night from the hosts. I loved being able to manage my bookings and pay all via my airbnb App! I received email confirmations, and text and was able to adjust my settings all without getting on my laptop. And my 7 nights at 2 very private entire homes on the ocean in Iceland? $1,100"

We have used this in the US with great success ! We will be traveling to France and have booked 4 different places in 4 different cities. All of the host were very quick and helpful to accept. I read through many reviews to get just the right place and hosts. I also just love to dream of the different places to travel. I like that you can rate the host and they can rate you. I like that there is a verifying system so you know if the person is real, if they're not verified I am not interested in staying with them. I was told about airbnb by a friend who travel everywhere for NASA and this is how she likes to travel when she goes. Love this app!"

After 1 year of hosting, airbnb's payout is better than renting monthly to traditional tenants! The same risks apply to renting via airbnb (bad guests, bedbugs, etc), yet airbnb minimizes this risk by utilizing a host:guest rating system. The host can rate each guest and vice versa. "

I understand the magnitude of having to create 1 app which simultaneously manages hosting and traveling knowing that only a handful of people do both but...nonetheless they need to do a better job. I host several units and travel a lot and I almost NEVER use the website so I am at the mercy of the app. Managing several properties on this app is a little frustrating. Notifications don't appear in a timely manner sometimes. Takes multiple refreshes to pop up at times. If it wasn't for the back email alert I receive I wouldn't know half the things that were happening. Hosts also need more hosting tools. Any ways...bottom line...it's great if your traveling, and needs work if you're hosting. I hate to say it but maybe it's time for 2 apps."

You have to report everything through the app there is no direct email and there is only one phone number and they will just tell you they'll get back to you and it'll take them a week, even longer sometimes."

Requesting copies of a few docs and a phone number is not enough. Guests have broken art, shelves, picked door locks, left food waste under couches and in the bathroom, reserved under their name and had another person stay, disrespected my neighbors, returned to the home after their reservation was completed and many more troubling situations. AirBnB is not equipped nor do they attempt to handle these types of situations. I had to call the police and that was the final straw."
5450,The Executive Happiness Coach,"July 13, 2015",5,"Fast and easy access I've become a big fan of both the airbnb process and of the app. I've now used it for individual travel, with my wife, and with the entire family; it has worked for me in various states in the U.S. and in two other countries, Italy and Japan.  As many people point out in their reviews, you have to be discerning and do your homework to rent spaces appropriate for you. If what your want/need is to be ""taken care of"" then just go to a hotel or a more traditional B&B -- tho even those vary wildly in cost and quality. I LOVE that the $$ are taken care of by the app. I love meeting my hosts. Sometimes when I rent a whole space I never meet them in person, but the app makes it so easy to communicate and get to know each other anyway."
5451,crinaldi90,"October 20, 2016",5,"Exceeded all doubts I am constantly on the go staying in hotels all the time, and after a little apprehension time after time I remained curious where I finally pulled the trigger and went for it. I always knew that it was potentially a more cost effective option than that of a hotel, but the reality is that the ease of use and sentiment of becoming one with the area you are visiting in a way as if there is an overnight acclimation. I would say that you don't get that the perks a hotel may offer, but you also get the type of privacy you would find in your own home without having anybody bother you. It's fun and exciting to be able to flirt with other places to live but then still go back to your own reality...if that's something you want."

Money was taken from me, the supposed host had not secured acceptance to sublet and I was turned away by her landlord who shared part of the home with the host. I don't have time to go through the menus to get a resolution ( namely a refund )  the host claimed she had not received her money from AirBNB. I do not believe her but that is another story. Basically the site need to have info to allow easier direct contact with a person to allow customers to reach a resolution with concerns. The help does nothing useful whatsoever in my opinion. "
5453,tomagain748,"February 8, 2017",3,"Hosting - ok with some super annoying bugs As a host you can do s fair bit with this app, but it has some super annoying bugs. For example, it tells you you have notifications and there is NO way to access or clear them from the app. You have to log in and hint all over the web interface and keep refreshing the app. I've had s notification for a week now that should indicate I have a guest I need to respond to and I cannot figure out anywhere on the website or the app how to clear it. Also, just in general, AirBnB is harder to use as a host than VRBO or TripAdvisor rentals so we tend to avoid taking bookings through AirBnB and only open our calendar short term for when we can't fill by other means because the app and the website just aren't as good. Only VRBO app/site feel like they are designed by people who actually have run their own rental."

The host for my husband's booking canceled within 7 days of our trip, and the host for my booking canceled TWO DAYS before the trip. As you can imagine, there was absolutely nothing available to book within our budget, even with the coupons given to each of us. The problem that was most infuriating was that AirBnB refused to combine our individual coupons into one so we could find a decent place for our Honeymoon, despite being on the phone with costumer support for over 5 hours. I used to recommend AirBnB to anyone I knew. Now, however, I will tell them that if one expects  guaranteed reservation and lodging, one's best bet is to go the typical route of booking a hotel. Otherwise, expect that you could end up paying way more than you budgeted, or wind up with nowhere to stay at all."

When I sent a message to the host to report the difficulty the system required me to select dates which are ""available"" only. This caused me to have to select additional dates that I did not want and now it will only allow me to Book these erroneous dates. Could you please remove the required field of available dates?

We are booked up regularly, sometimes even having to host people using air beds because we are out of room! Travelers, international students, people in between apts, so so so many people! This app has been crucial in allowing people to contact me and book their reservations quickly because it sends me a special notice each time! I love meeting new people while I'm hosting them in my home and the extra $$$ isn't bad either! Love it! I recommend it to all my family and friends who have the space and are open minded."

There was a bug in the App (Even they had my address details, their auto geo-tagging function still went wrong. The map showed my address in another neighborhood.) The guest asked me for my number after booking to pick up the keys, because making phone calls is more convenient. Then the guest complained about me to them as a dishonest person who runs scam even I had all my personal information verified. Then I got the rude guest loudly yelled at me over the phone with rude words. Later, I called the customer service three times, wrote them 3 emails. But not only did they help, but they sent me a warning email of suspending my account for contacting guests outside their system. But I only contacted them after booking was finished. This is definitely horrible. And i tried to contact them again, their signal reception was so bad that they could not hear me."

Luckily I had the address saved on google maps, so I have to wander 30 mins to find free wifi to load the simple text exchange I had to get the passcode for entry.

As much as I like having my own space, the interactions with the hosts are also priceless. A short conversation with a local can open up many doors. As for the app itself, i really like the design and the simplicity of booking a place.

The default status for all dates is available and cannot be changed. There are only several weekends where my listing will actually be available so the workaround for me seems to be to mark all other days as unavailable (which is a real pain). I realize there is a snooze function but that doesn't really meet my needs. Ideally I could mark the few weekends or so in the coming months that I know will be available, then everything else would be unavailable. I've read other people have had this issue so it's weird that such a glaring issue with a seemingly simple solution hasn't been fixed.

That was two months ago. No email in sight. What is the point of having a customer service phone line where no one knows the answers to any questions, and what is the point of having an email address where the company never responds to you. Used to be one of my favorite apps, but I have never been so disappointed with the lack of ability to solve an issue that has now been going on for over a year.

The website would send me to the app but the app and the website didn't seem to share information it was like I was setting up two separate accounts. After digging through pages on the website to figure out how to email for help I got an unhelpful response...basically ""keep trying"".

While I'm sure they are a reliable site they still run the risk if being hacked and I don't think I wanna risk identity theft to save a few bucks. I was so excited to finally book through them but I ended up going through another site ONLY because I think there are other ways they can verify me for example and I would be more than happy to show my ID to a host upon arrival to my destination opposed to putting it in an app where I won't know how long they will store it or how they might use it."

I have given huge amounts of patients and waited to do three months in between each complaint and they never addressed this issue, and now I have been told to never bring it up again.  So now  messages are always overflowing in your inbox, and messages that I already deleted on the desktop always reappear in the app. I think any and all air B&B members rate this out poorly and file a complaint every time you talk to AirB&B until they fix the fact that you can delete your own messages the way any inbox has worked since 1995."

It's the only way I book and communicate with the hosts and it has been great. This is not just for young people with no standards. Be sure to read reviews and communicate with the host(s). Try it fairly close to home first to get the hang of it (like if you live in the suburbs and need to stay downtown for a weekend event for example). And then branch out. It's better than staying at a hotel both price and experience wise. I'm so happy I've started utilizing this service for my travel.

I just travelled abroad using this app and had no trouble at all communicating with hosts and finding each listing. What's more, it served as a great way to explore new places and meet awesome, cool new people (hosts). You can find a listing that suits your needs.

It seems that a filter is being run after the search and some sort of race condition causes the filter to only occasionally get applied. Sometimes the search randomly fails. The navigation makes no sense since the back button is basically used for all navigation, even if you aren't going ""back"". The slider bar for the price filter doesn't allow fine control and since a lot of people list rooms for hundreds of dollars, it's practically impossible to adjust the filter with more than a $10 accuracy.

So not only did I not get the reservation, I was out of cash to reserve another. My girlfriend had even worse experience. They withdrew 500$ from her account and has not gotten it back yet.

After I charged my card, the screen did not take me to a confirmation page, which seems like a glitch to me. Also, I'm guessing (hoping) that since I theoretically booked a place, it's no longer listed. This means however that I can't contact my prospective host.

With respect to the whole checkout flow I book a place and (currently in Berlin) after 24 hours of trying to arrange place after place and being declined (4x) am starting to look at other options (booking, hostels, etc). Can’t they automate a sequence and just let the product do this for me? I thought tech was supposed to make life easier, not harder. At best a weak offering and given the time this company has had to nail the product it leaves me skeptical. The redesign is a waste of time if it doesn’t work for your primary/initial business focus.

Both owners and renters are losing opportunities to do business due to the unhelpful, irrational constraints put on their customer service reps so they cannot resolve technical issues or problems with booking when they occur."
5484,KodiakJules,"February 26, 2017",4,"Personal Customer Service is the ONLY... Personal Customer Service is the ONLY thing that separates one business from another -- the HUMAN VOICE CONTACT factor & I do you feel, as many other reviewers' have said, that being able to call Airbnb would be a great comfort when we run into obstacles as Hosts/Guests & need HUMAN-INTERACIVE assistance. I have managed to 'click thru' various issues & various buttons to find contact numbers for Airbnb, but I have not had to resort to trying to call yet either so I can't comment on those numbers at this time. I know it would mean increasing the price Airbnb takes as their cut to hire more people, but again HUMAN VOICE customer service would be worth it to me, IMHO. Airbnb has a great business model and it surpasses VRBO many times over."

5486,ZannyNYC,"April 6, 2013",3,"Needs work Some people think this is the place to review airbnb as such, but this is not the case. These reviews are meant for the app only. That being said, despite the large number of updates, the app still misses the mark on a couple fronts. The first and most egregious is the fact that unlike most (non-bank related) apps, you have to log-in every single time you want to use it. This seems like a small matter, but can get annoying when you have multiple guests/inquiries and use the app a lot. Second - when you try to send messages to guests, often the message disappears when you hit send and does not actually send. If you don't think to save the message first as a safety, you'll have to recompose it. "
5487,Alexdlc,"August 1, 2013",4,"Non efficient app I love airbnb. But I hate this app. I've been using airbnb to rent out my apartment when I travel which is every 2 months or so, and I like to be able to change the rate on my apartment to be competitive. It is next to impossible to change the rate on this app for certain days, and they never show you how much you could potentially get from an inquiry. I literally log in every time to the desktop version of airbnb on safari on my iPhone, it's much more user friendly even if a few more extra steps. I feel like people who wrote the 5 star reviews must not need to know the amount of $ a reservation can add up to or never change their price, or aren't actually people that use this app... Step up your game airbnb!"
5488,Uncomprehendable,"April 23, 2014",1,"Confused I recently booked 2 trips with airbnb. One of the coming in 2 weeks. About a month ago I had to scan my ID in (no problems yet). I get an email from airbnb telling me my account has been temporarily suspended (I email back, still fine with the situation) and ask them why I hadn't heard back. 2 more weeks go by, until today. I get a response telling my I can't be a member because they did some ""Lexis~Nexis"" background check on me and that my account was suspended for multiple felonies. I have never received a felony, I have gotten one speeding ticket and one wreck. Never arrested or been to jail. I live in a bigger city and was wondering if I should email them back and tell them they have the wrong person. There are probably 60 people where I love with name. I did not appreciate being called a convict and a liar. I never hold grudges but this is beyond belief, my jaw hit the floor when I read that....very unfortunate...."
5489,theCoffeeScientist,"May 30, 2015",2,"does AirBnB care? I've had a couple really great experiences with hosts/places but 4 out of 6 so far have been BAD, as in ""I can't wait to get out of this place, can't get a refund and still have 10 days left!"". Their 24 hour time limit policy for issues between host/guest doesn't really cut it. Sometimes you don't realize there's an issue until the end of the second day or later. Japan hosts have been really bad! A ton of share houses with an absent host, showing map locations an hour away from where they really are, hosts changing their daily fees constantly, sending ""special offers"" way over their daily and weekly listed prices and ridiculous cleaning fees ($30-70 for washing sheets and sweeping or vacuuming a room?!? Give me a break). This is a cash cow and as long as they get their cut They are happy. Their responses have been lip service rather than anything else."

I'd recommend it, in short."

I would use the filter to pick my dates before I started my search, then confirm my dates before I sent the final request. Then I would notice, once the request had been accepted, that the dates had jumped a day previous to the ones I had selected. I didn't understand how this error kept happening, and Airbnb does not let you modify any of your request, even before it's been accepted, so I have to message them and tell them that I won't be there in time to stay in there place. Mostly people are understanding, but I've had some people that have been angry at me, and not refunded my money when I noticed this error too late. Please fix!"
5492,Runiccharm,"July 2, 2016",5,Traveler My husband and I initially used Air Bnb to travel abroad and loved it. We enjoyed having unique places to stay for prices usually less if not at least comparable to a hotel. I like the feeling of staying in homes instead of hotels. I sometimes meet the locals and can choose a place located exactly in the part of town preferred. So far each place has been very clean and the hosts way more helpful than a busy front desk person that doesn't seem to know the area except for the truck stop restaurant right next door. (This usually seems to be the case during my hotel stays). We are now using air bnb instead of booking hotels. Many of the homes even come with hot tubs;)
5493,Songtresses,"August 31, 2016",1,"Terrible, unless you like changes to settings and prices you didn't make Really, you can't even perform basic functions properly on the app except for messaging without major problems.  The thing that annoys me more than anything is the way they have it set so that when I try to use the website instead on my iPad (which is what I use for my on the go business), they force me repeatedly back to the faulty, annoying, unfinished app. Truly the most irritating experience with an app in my iPad life.  Oh, and the glitches that change your settings out of the blue to offer enormous long term discounts you never set, or even instant booking you never allowed, lower prices than you ask?  I've had it all.  And depending on which Airbnb rep you get they'll be honest about the convenient glitch, or lie and say they've never heard about it, despite the fact the complaints are all over the Internet.  Awful."
5494,Tripwire324,"February 3, 2017",3,"Great for finding places. Horrible for resolution of complaints Be sure you understand how the system works on a laptop before trying to use the app. I was in Costa Rica trying to reserve a house and was accepted. Host came back and said he needed to cancel because he rented it on another site. I asked him to cancel my reservation because if the host cancels, you get your airbnb fee back. Since he did t want to do that, I was lost until I started digging through the resolution center. That is where the problem is. You have to dig down through submenus to actually request a refund. Airbnb has FAQ section that they think will answer all questions. It doesn't.  Finally had to request money from host before I found the ""request host cancel"" button.  That should be up about two layers."
5495,elijahsonger,"April 2, 2017",4,"Great App! Great Company but While I've I've had pretty great experiences 3 out of 4 times, I think that those who are offering their homes/rooms for Airbnb shouldn't be allowed to have religious paraphernalia exposed. It's so uncomfortable as a Christian to stay in a place full of Buddha statues and other gods hanging or sitting everywhere. Hotels don't do it and I feel like Airbnb should be the same or at least let patrons know that you have these things all around your house so that they get to make an informed decision about where they want to sleep and relax. It's too late to be out of the country and the day you settle in, see a bunch of stuff that makes you uncomfortable about the place you're dwelling in for the duration of your stay. A total inconvenience."
5496,Daydreamer 19,"April 17, 2012",5,"Airbnb best travel accommodation App in the world!!! The idea as the essence is brilliantly simple, rent the space you do not use! You can sub rent a bed or a huge villa at the same time, by the day, by the month, eliminating the days you have friends over, or you are throwing a party for your birthday and you need the place to yourself. Total freedom for both sides, for both parties, though complete strangers, all become a Woldwide group of friends. Safest way to do your payments too and ensure that all went as planned even days after the trip. The air bnb team has improved all procedures, with a caring support team and someone there for you 24/7. That is what I call a strong team! Thank you air bnb!"
5497,thegingerminion,"November 27, 2014",3,"Airbnb is great! The app... I just finished booking my first trip with this app. iPhone 6+ running 8.1.1 It's beautiful, but has major issues. Verifying my identity was a nightmare, and I almost canceled the whole thing and booked a hotel, then I realized there was a hold on my credit card so pushed through. I had to go through the process to verify 8 times and still don't know why it worked the last time and not the first. When I tried to contact support it just went through the verification process again. Annoying. Once I got the verification done my booking was complete, except somehow the app reset the dates! Fortunately I had already contacted the host and she noticed it was off and adjusted it. I'll keep looking for places to stay with the app, but likely book on a laptop."

You can meet really cool locals when you're traveling and if you do the proper research you can find some really awesome places to stay. I've rented someone's extra home and have also had guests stay in my extra room. All of my experiences with AirBnb have been positive. Be smart and stay with people who have been verified, have good reviews, and have lots of details and photos. If you are dumb enough to stay with someone who has little info then you deserve the bad experience. If you're s grumpy old man and want to stick to ""hotels and lodges"" then please do so, the cool people of AirBnb don't want you anyway!"

ID verification repeatedly failed with no error or message to tell me so, it crashed while taking a picture, and the chat is beyond broken to the point where it is unusable. Most of the time it doesn't load at all, and when it does it doesn't display a keyboard (but you have half type on the empty space). Additionally, the Open in App option from Safari doesn't work, which also makes things more difficult if you are looking to jump from the desktop to mobile via Safari's hand off feature. "

Additionally, often a guest makes an inquiry and my response may lead them to choose not to stay, but the onus is on the owner to ""approve or decline"" and the app keeps telling me I have an unread message until I approve or decline, but until I hear from the guest I don't want to approve (for example, if they put in a shorter range of dates than what then actually want, I can't approve the request, I don't want to decline, as they may agree to the offer I gave them, it ) I think the app should let go of the inquiry as well have actually responded even if I have not selected the option they force on me."
5502,Itslittleoldme,"September 12, 2016",3,"I'm thankful there's an app but... Like many others have said it's glitchy. Which is tough for hosts especially. I constantly have a notification that I have to check several places to find. In my opinion where messages are located is odd - it's in my profile? There is also so much that's not available on the app that's online, but it also seems like it works vice versa too. I know the app isn't meant to be a replica of the website but I have to constantly check both to feel confident that I haven't missed anything. An example of an app that doesn't have ALL the capabilities of the website but is streamlined well is eBay! Again as a seller/host this is important. Perhaps have a new person set up a page on the app and see how it reflects on the website!"
5503,Jake Bond,"November 2, 2016",4,"For anyone, not everyone. This app isn't for everyone, but anyone can use it. User friendly, good rating systems, and plenty of places to stay. You can always learn about where you are going in advance, and staying in a stranger's house has probably never felt so homey until now. Needless to say there are still people who would prefer a hotel experience with room service and the nine yards, several places here lack that. You just have to know what you are looking for, hence anyone can use it, but it isn't for everyone. 4 stars for a great first time experience and the app being entirely functional with no crashes, it lost a star because I'm never going to pay that much money for three nights in Chicago."

5508,miken,"June 26, 2015",5,"Is an alternate approach to travel Is not about going against hotels, having 25 and no money or being desperate to host for $60. Is about another way of traveling, another experience. Is alternate to traditional traveling which is fine and totally worth as an option. But Airbnb is about having the chance of living an experience that would be virtually impossible otherwise, whether you are a young person saving money and discovery the world, or being a wealthy person living alternative experiences. Personally I prefer no to share with the host, there's a great offering for that, is not just about saving money, is about having alternatives for travel experiences."

5511,Juan Esteban Delgado,"June 16, 2016",3,"Great for traveling, hard for host Before, the app had a laggy server in that it would not report you timely of inquiries, or when you 'pull-down' to refresh. That has gotten worse. Now the UI has changed with functionality and buttons and you can longer find the information logically from point a to point b without having to dig for it. For example you can't access guests messaging easy because it's hidden in another option.. Another example is you can't access the guests phone number logically from their message when before you could.  I only have 1 unit and these slow notifications, lack of being able to find numbers or message guest make it hard to be an effective host. Airbnb is changing for sure"
5512,EllenNBA,"August 12, 2016",4,"Pretty good with a few exceptions As a host, you cannot add the tax you must pay (at least in the city where we live) and you cannot enter different rental rates for different times of year.

5513,Diehajqd,"November 17, 2016",1,"Terrible App App features and usability are far inferior to the website - and even that isn't good.  I've used Airbnb many times and am ready to abandon it... too much flaky behavior by hosts is allowed, including last-minute cancellations with NO recourse and you're left scrambling for a hotel at last-minute prices.  The same places show at different prices for the same dates.  Maps fail to show some properties that meet all filter criteria - including ones wishlisted.  Hosts are allowed to arbitrarily demand prices or minimum stays other than those listed. NONEXISTENT customer service.   NONE - they have NEVER even acknowledged an email.  This was a good concept but is poorly executed without adequate controls or safeguards. "

When I want to navigate between the map and listings and hit the back button because I can't find any way to get out of the map section, I am taken back to the first search screen. In the filter options there is "" Price"" text for narrowing search by price but it does nothing. Another annoyance is (this is not AirBnb's fault but there could be better community tagging) is so many users post completely irrelevant photos ( like of their dogs) or of sight seeing that has no context to the rental.

Must scroll down to see new Notifications-strange. Updates like order of photos or other setting changes shift around by itself.

In the meantime, there's now a hold on my credit card for the amount but here's the kicker....you get an email later from the owner saying the property isn't available. I emailed the owner with a screen shot of my dates and the ""availability"" status and they apologized saying it wasn't and never was available for those dates....but it gets better....this happened with every one of their properties in that area.

The service staff doesn't know anything except what they can Google (for example, where the booking was physically located) and were rude to boot.  After they couldn't reach the host they posted a fake review in my name on their site indicating that *I* had cancelled the reservation the day before I arrived. Spent hours waiting at the premise and ran up $50 in roaming fees talking to their service staff for nothing. No thank you, never again. The company gives you a false sense of security by taking you money directly, but really all they do is take control out of your hands to resolve issues yourself and their only interest is collecting their fee."

I'll admit that there are lots of quality homes overseas, and I LOVE the map feature which allows you to hone in, almost at street level (always want to be near Starbucks!), but the filtering doesn't always apply. I wanted 2 person apt.'s and many times I had to wade through bigger and more expensive (way more...) than I had set my filter to. This made my search way more cumbersome. I wish the ap was a bit more agile. It becomes way too time consuming. Also, segregating by neighborhood (maybe a 'key word') would be extremely helpful. It would allow you to compare prices (i.e. Manhattan vs Staten Island) which to the foreign visitor is not always clear in comparison."

You can look at the credentials for each host to make sure they are credible. I think it's a very secure way to vacation.

It seems to have been programmed as an afterthought and seems buggy at times but it allows a host to do their part when away from a computer which is what I use it for. I do prefer the web based version. "
5540,Reetercat,"October 8, 2016",2,"Not Great While Actually Traveling In the real world of travel, you may not always have an internet connection or SIM card that works on your mobile. This app doesn't do much for wanting to see reservation details offline. It hangs and shows nothing. When we were in Italy, we were running late and I sent our host a message. The app never sent the message and there's no record of it to be found. It would be helpful of the chat feature would be updated to work with the likes of whatsapp, fiber, Skype, etc. - Or at least be competitive with such services. Our host was left wondering where we were and contacted airbnb customer service looking for us. Not cool. "
5541,MamaRuths#Cake,"July 14, 2017",4,"Excellent, but... You have to know how to make it work for you.  Well managed, AirBnB is a great travel resource.  But stick to well- and frequently well-rated places.  The SuperHost marker is useful, but be sure it's based on more than a few good marks over time.  My one bad experience with a S came when I booked in a place that had only 15 total reviews, mostly very good and no really bad ones, but 3+ years.  For three years, that's not many.  Turns out people who've had a bad experience just don't leave a review rather than risk being trolled by a bad host.  Finally, be a good guest.  Clean, neat, responsible, and good communicator gets you a long ways in AitBnB, as in life, or at least some of it."

In order to complete this step I was forced to download the app in order to take a ""selfie."" While I understand the reason behind confirming an identity, this made what could have been a 5 minute process a full half an hour as all of the steps I had done online prior to needing to provide the ""selfie"" had been ignored and I had to repeat them in the app. This was NOT a smooth reservation process. I will think long and hard before trying to make a reservation here again if I have to do this step every time. It was very tedious."

We looked and looked and even booked a place but the host falsely advertised his place and me being trusting I booked and found out the real truth and tried cancelling all within a 24 hr period. The host agreed to refund me but then I had to chase him down for my money back and he decided he didn't want to refund. I called and called airbnb about him and they really didn't care or want to get involved. I kept bugging air bnb and not taking no for an answer and after a month I got my money back but let me tell u it came with a lot of stress and nightmare with it! My suggestion is double /triple check anything and everything !!! Or don't book I will never use airbnb again and have told everyone about this ! And hope that u don't have a jerk of a host who's a slime bag !

I have just wasted an hour of my morning trying to get a better understanding of this app and feeling compelled to write this review, which I never do. There is no reason it should take me that long to figure out how to use an app. I'm no techno wiz, but I'm pretty sure the whole point of apps are to make things easy.  These guys are taking a cut from the host side and the guest side you think they would have enough money to make a better app. I'm getting more bookings from their competitor, so I'm seriously considering shutting down my listing on this app and not dealing with the headache."

The functionality has been diminished so much that I just logged into the Airbnb website to complete my order. Now, I am on the road and tried to check-in but there is an error saying I do not have access to the reservation and the app freezes. Luckily, I contacted the host via the messenger and was able to get access.  The changes to the app were disappointing, then to have it crash was a huge let down.

Ive never been so frustrated in my life over an app in the app store. When you try to choose dates to filter within the app, the app does not give you accurate dates, and also will give you locations that are not the location you originally indicated. Its simple, have the app tell you the dates are not available, and or the location is not available initially when you input your dates & locations. There needs to be an option to where the app suggests a radius within your desired location. Also, the app will glitch at times when you go too book a room & pay. The user experience needs to be simplified vs complicating what should be a simple process. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE AIRBNB... Get it together so your users can be happy customers!!"

He cornered me to accept to stay the bad condition that he lied about without telling AirBnB, and since I had no other option (emergency business trip), I had to put up with it. When I couldn't take it anymore, I left the place earlier and this host retaliated by leaving me bad, falsified reviews. Later on, I tried to contact AirBnB about this host's terrible behaviors, both regarding the business misconduct and the uncomfortable, disrespectful comments he made about me (he's Caucasian and I'm Asian). But AirBnB neither resolved my financial dispute, nor investigated this host or regarded my complaints/reports. I shouldn't have had my hopes up about their safety or protection for guests or the credibility of their hosts. I'd rather rely on good old hotel/motel system from now on."

For example, when a booking becomes active, a full screen animation plays displaying some text ""get ready for your trip "" and listing the address, but the address is not clickable! What's the use when I have to navigate to Maps app manually and toggle back and forth to eat my driving directions? The app also messes up the visual map marker placement and the address listed-- one or the other is often incorrect.

To accomplish anything: such as, the initial verification, selection or finding a AirBnB or writing a review required each task to be duplicated or triplicates in order for it to work. And more than once frozen screens appeared which requiring one to start over. At this particular writing there appears to be insufficient technical support to operate this apps.

This was nice to have to make sure you're messaging the right person at all times.

Slightly limited at times on phone app...better on either an iPad or laptop. Feedback or Rating feature should be improved for a host...because the Host are at the mercy of their guests, if the guests decide that a neighbor is too noisy, or they can hear any noise that you cannot control, many will leave a poor rating!  This is really not fair.  Also, if a guest fails to read the entire description of the place they are staying, it shouldn't be the hosts fault, and thus receive a less-than 5-Star rating, etc."

Collectively the two get the job done.  However, Airbnb's overall services are somewhat lacking, whether it be via App or full web portal.  For example, it is not simple to find a way to make a phone call for assistance, errors were made regarding taxes that were not communicated or able to be diagnosed quickly or clearly, and the ability for hosts to set parameters is limited (such as the ability to set a different price for any guest requesting a one night stay).  Overall it is better than not having Airbnb at all."

As opposed to going to hotels where interaction is limited to Host and Hostesses. Airbnb is personal as you stay with people in their places and you can share a room, have a private room, or you can rent the entire place. It gives a personal experience and oftentimes hosts will show you around and let you know the best spots that locals go to. You are able to go all over the world, and avoid those pricey hotels. I highly recommend this app!"

I've had such a positive experience and feel it is much more worth it than paying an over priced hotel. All the hosts I have felt with have been super accommodating and friendly. I feel much more comfortable knowing that my hard earned cash is going to good people rather than a hotel who doesn't care for your concerns. I recommend this to anyone who travels often or just for a quick getaway. You will always find what u are looking for and more. I can't rave enough! Thank you!

I called the bank and they notified that following the airbnb transaction there were several card charges across various states and retailers, which triggered their auto-fraud detection. After confirming that those were fraud charges the bank closed my card and issued a new one, which is a major pain when you have auto-payments set up through the card. Thinking it was a coincidence I tried to book with another card and again the card was declined.  Incredulous that a company like airbnb wouldn't have a secured payment system I tried 3 cards and the same thing happened.

They also told me multiple times they would return my phone call within minutes, the day, the week, but did not. The instant booking failed me and was not available until 2hours later and I felt like I was manipulated in order for the host to benefit from the instant receipt of money, but never providing a service. In light of the racial discrimination lawsuit filed against airbnb, I'm not surprised that they & hosts claim no accountability for mistreating users.

Mails as a traveler (or guest) goes to another mail box. Now how long will it take you to find that. After a while... after trial and error.. you'll find the switching under the ""people"" icon.

Previously working features like copy/(pasting) of messages and the help contact page don't work properly any more.   If you happen to submit a message to a group you then will continue to receive notifications even if you turn off notifications (which is only possible from the website -- H-e-l-l-o!!) or even leave the group!!

The app is slow to update and often doesn't show alerts when I have a new booking request or message. I usually fine out by text or email, so if I didn't have this backup notification turned on then I would not be notified by the app. Also, all messages should be cashed locally so if you are somewhere without the internet connection you can still see all the location and booking info. There should also be a way to report incorrect listings. It is also problematic that although I request verified ID only it lets people who only link Facebook, not an actual ID, book, which lessens trust. There should be clearer instructions for newbies about how to use the app."

The only complaint I have is sometimes the prices can be a bit high but the places up are beautiful. You do have to make sure you do your research because sometimes you'll end up finding that you're staying with the host or that you're in a house/apartment/condo that isn't as clean/nice as it's presented. That's only happened to me one. And the refund policies are not always great so be sure to check it all out before reserving. Other than that I use Airbnb whenever I get the chance!

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the prices shown don't reflect the varying nature of the prices. For instance, a host can have their room listed for $10/night, but the actual price could be jacked up to $60/night. The app doesn't show the price of the room each night and how it varies depending on the day of the week/time of the year. You will only know by going through the booking process what your actual total would be. Other than that, the app is amazing."

I have been using Airbnb for years now and it has NEVER failed. Always had a great experience with Airbnb. The app is easy to use. It lets you choose how much you want to spend a night, if you want an entire house and just has a lot of nice people who rent their homes out. I've been recommending Airbnb to all my friends and family and they are beyond happy with them. Thank you Airbnb."
5592,Miss Figge,"September 21, 2016",4,"LOVE Air bnb, but the app has issues... Air bnb is pretty much the best way to experience a place. I've done this for New Orleans, Portland, and San Francisco. The way the service runs is perfect! Book and pay through the app, talk to the homeowner through the app, it's great. The app has some annoying issues though. It says I have notifications and I don't, and I can't seem to clear the little red ""1"" and it's driving me crazy. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it! Sometimes it will say I have a message in my inbox and when I go in, the message hasn't delivered yet and I'll get it hours later. Anyway, great service, work on the app please!"

They've hidden the listings at the bottom of the profile, they have remove the lists of reservations of your space, they have remove all possibilities to update your listings.

5594,Quantum Monk,"February 25, 2013",5,"Finding tenants made fun, sharing what I love, helping people & getting paid for it! Airbnb rocks!! The benefits of Airbnb are amazing!... Think about what happens when you know you are going to host some guests: You clean up your home, put out your most inspiring stuff to share, courageously anticipate letting new people into your world, discover assets and income you didn't know was there, all with full coverage insurance and partners that provide world class, quality service etc. etc. - Airbnb is a humanitarian cornerstone in a new sharing economy that puts hope  and prosperity back into people's hearts."

It was so seamless and even fun to set up on my iPad. Beautiful pictures, and hopefully I will be staying in a beautiful home tomorrow. I just had one weird thing happen on my iPad Air during the ID verification. It said it was verified but then kept going on in this loop and telling me to verify my ID. I wasn't sure if my housing request was going through. When I logged in online and did it, it worked, and then I got an email that my request was delivered to the host."
5598,Elite Platypus,"September 17, 2015",4,"Review writing issue Excellent app, great UI. But if you're going to set a review deadline and ask me to type into the boxes, I expect the input boxes to retain my writing until I click next. I basically had to type in my review 3 times. When I double tapped the home button to close out another app and came back to my review, all the words I typed were gone. Frustrating since by accident I clicked something else on the page and same thing happened again. This business runs on reviews. It's what users care about. So if you want to make sure you're getting the right stuff, please fix this bug."
5599,CurtAshburn,"May 1, 2016",4,"Steadily Improving We are primarily Airbnb hosts and occasional guests. From a host standpoint, the app shows steady improvement. It is not especially intuitive, but it is really invaluable for hosts. Airbnb puts a premium on hosts responding to inquiries and requests for booking within 24 hours. Having the app has made it easy for us to maintain a 100% response rate. "

Both sides contain a wealth of information on past history of rentals, recommendations and advice. I've used Airbnb for over two years now and think highly of this company. They are friendly and exhibit a very high degree of integrity and personal care. The app had a bit of a learning curve to Gleen all its information. But is in general easy and intuitive to use.   Very difficult to find a home in the area you are looking. Near impossible to remove your search history and there is no addressable search engine. Is this amateurs night at Airbnb. Really!"

Went through account setup, verified email & phone, authorized PayPal account for payment, & found a place.  On the last step, actually booking the place, and it just disabled my account without explanation.  Got an email saying there was a problem with my payment method, so they completely disabled my account.  No opportunity to pick another payment method or anything, just immediately killed my account. Ridiculous.  Only recourse appears to be appeal process to get my account reopened.  Unacceptable.  Had to create another account using wife's info and a different payment method.  Didn't need this additional stress and time wasting while dealing with storm prepping the house and evacuating my family."

I'm proud to say I've spend the last 6 months in an airbnb and definitely anticipate using it for the next 6. Definitely have some interface issues with constant updates, but as long as they keep the great formula of having good host at competitive prices I will never stay in a hotel again."
5603,Greg4923,"March 1, 2017",2,"Was a great app The latest update to the Airbnb app has rendered it much less useable than it had been.  It introduced a lot of clutter in the form of ""Experiences"" and guides. It also introduced a timeline (e.g., in Facebook) that put your most recent rentals at the bottom so you have to scroll to find them (if you're a frequent Airbnb user, this is a real nuisance)."

I did put a lock on the closet but other than that I opened my home to a total stranger... and it was better than the subletting I have done off craigslist. Not necessarily better people but a shorter time. It's expensive to live in San Francisco, even more so because of the life I choose to live. Airbnb is a sheppard not only for me but travelers like me who are always moving. I agree if it's your once a year vacation maybe the risk is to high.... But I do believe there is a separate god for travelers so hit the road and come visit!! - m2"

Skeptical and very, very nervous whether is was legit or not, I booked my stays all through Europe because it seemed more personal and cost far less than hotels or hostels. When my group and I arrived in England at midnight I was sweating, holding onto hope it wasn't to good to be true. Now 3 years later I am more confident than ever with success in every rental I've booked (I hope I don't jinx myself). I recommend it to everyone who asks me how I save money traveling.

I've had a total if only 4 people/couples stay with me and they have been respectful, quite. I did have a guest who brought someone else for a total of 3 people so I later added a additional fee for extra guest. Thank goodness I recently bought a sofa bed. The extra money has been nice as well."

It's frustrating because the dots are now permanently here after any communication. PLEASE FIX. I am being over run by my notification dots on my phone and can't tell which messages are new and which ones I've already responded to by just looking at my messages. I have to click on each individual message! I missed a couple of messages the other day. This is not good service and I can't provide great communication to my guests or future guests."

A true grass roots company has changed the way the world opens its doors to strangers, i have to be honest, I use the word revolutionary because i believe Airbnb will contribute to an amazing era of social change where we begin to seriously try to love our neighbors as we would ourselves!"

Then, a day later it was cancelled. Then, they took money out of my account without me even making a reservation. I show 2 different withdrawals but they only put money back in once. Customer service gives you the standard script answers without being able to provide any answers, I've asked for a supervisor DOZENS of times. I got to talk to a supervisor ONCE and then she wasn't much help. I'm now going to have to cancel my debit card so they won't be able to deduct with it any more."

Like when I get a request via txt message it says accept or decline. It takes me to the App Store to download the app. I have the app. What? I'll go to help center with a question. It's unable to answer. I say my question isn't here. It sends me to the help center. What? IM IN THE HELP CENTER. it's confusing for host and guest but it's all we got. I've complained but alas no help. But like I said. People from all over the world have stayed at my Airbnb. So for that reason. It's awesome.

It also saved me big time as I missed my flight out of Barcelona and needed to book a room immediately and was able to find and book a place in less than an hour, and all for $68. I am definitely telling all my friends about this app and will be traveling more around the US just because I want to use this more often."

It's functional, aesthetically pleasing and ultimately makes being a host via cell phone that much easier. I haven't experienced any major bugs or random shutdowns. However there are a few things that make it not so navigation friendly. In example: viewing your calendar, viewing your own profile. A suggestion would be getting updates/reminder alerts that your next guests check in 24 hours in advanced would be a bonus for the next version. Overall really no complaints, love this app and more importantly love airbnb!"

We can get 2+ rooms and 2+ bathrooms with living space and kitchen for far less than 2 hotel rooms.  We've been able to do this where our kids go to college (perfect for move-in dates with time and space left to relax and enjoy the city areas).  We've also used airbnb especially in Europe where hotel rooms typically only sleep 2 people.  I don't know what we would have done before airbnb.  Oh yeah, we would've spent twice as much or more and have been totally cramped :)"

It's also much easier to change calendar availability settings as well as view multiple listings' calendars on the desktop full version.

Host didn't answer my questions of what were the actual per nights and when we're the $95 nights. I complained to Airbnb about not having the host disclose true pricing. Airbnb said in response-Hosts set the prices and you'll have go to our website and hover over the days to see actual pricing...If you can't get actual pricing on the calendar in the app Airbnb, then your App isn't ready, accurate, and useable!...Forget the app people, just go to the website as Airbnb says."

I would suggest allowing hosts  to select a specific minimum age for booking as some environments are not appropriate for minors or people under 21. We write it in our house rules but still get booked by people under 21. If you can create a filter for this when guests are booking this would be helpful. Also, please find a way to increase ID submissions as this puts us at ease when we know who our guests are. Thanks for changing our lives Airbnb! We are so grateful that you exist!"

The cops had to be called and my wife and I finally had to get a hotel room and and leave for a couple days because we feared for our safety. From our one-time experince with Airbnb, its plain to see that this companys background checks are not up to snuff. Not only did the tenant have no legal right to sublet her apartment, her renters had to have had a record. This app ought to make those trying to rent provide a copy of a deed, or a lease to show they have a legal right to rent. Would never feel safe using this service."

The accommodations are all you really need and unlike other places we stayed,  they provided plenty of hot water, air conditioning, a refrigerator and stove as well as a coffee pot.

New version has many issues but the biggest one for me is that my custom pricing keeps getting overwritten with standard rate sporadically. I've lost hundreds if not thousands of dollars and had to turn off instant book because I have zero confidence in my rates remaining as I have set them repeatedly. I finally performed my own testing and figured out when I updated my house manual the rates reset. I reported this to support and the guy I spoke with could not get it even after a 20 minute discussion. I finally just said forget it and hung up. So frustrating. This is hurting my business!

The chat feature sends messages through email as well as the app, so I can easily print out instructions beforehand. I only give it 4 stars because I suspect all the scrolling needed might put some users off. Also, the site should show the price including the fees.

Graphics nice and nicely compact in its design.  There are a couple of important flaws.  It can look like you have a message, but no message.  I believe this is because the message area includes messages from Airbnb. Please separate my actual messages from guests or my hosts when I am traveling and those from you!  Second, I keep receiving notices just on this app in the message section that I need to write a review - when the reviews are actually complete.  They do not disappear."
5630,Sweet Jo 725,"June 3, 2017",5,"Hate to love it But as a host and a guest over 300 times in 4 years it really works well.  I feel like the people who have problems must just be 'problem-attracting' or not easy-going people.  You have to be kind of 'chill' and curious if you're going to invite strangers into your home or be the stranger in someone's home.  If you're tenuous, don't accept folks (or go) where there's no reviews.  Leave the first visits to us long time users who DO stay at new places in order to give feedback and make it an easier decision for you newbies!"

I found a great looking place but when I was checking out I had two terrible issues. One, the photo that must be taken of your id wouldn't upload I had to exit and reload the photo 4 times before it worked. Two, when I was checking out the app required me to confirm two mini payments on my account. Sadly there was no way for me to access the card account to check these amounts and confirm the card. When I went to switch to another card I was told the apartment was no longer available to book. "
5633,Johnmacfootball,"September 6, 2017",3,A little complicated to host. Takes a while to get your first payment. Can be 24 hours to 30days I was told.  I wanted to split and list the two extra bedrooms separately but you have to make an entirely new listing for each room. There are a lot of questions to make a new listing so it's kind of a pain. I wanted to change checkin time for a guest and it wouldn't let them check in. Had to call customer service.  They took on average about 20-30 min to get someone who can make my changes from my 3 calls with them.   Friendly well spoken reps though.  If you are keeping it to just a house or one bedroom it's pretty straight forward.

I am not sure quite where I will end up but it will be near a beach and have palm trees and maybe even some Hollywood stars. That is what I have been doing with the AirBNB service and loving it. I have been staying with many different hosts (as a +1 w/ fiancée before I registered ) who were all fabulous!

The section with messages to/from owners is not connected to the properties themselves. So, if you are in a thread with several potential places, there is no way to easily click back to the property pictures and details. You have to exit this area and go back to your favorites and hunt to find the property. If you haven't favorited it, you have to initiate a completely new search. This is terrible. Also, how hard would it be to save a search and have the app ping you when new properties become available. Not possible."
5637,Caseyjmc,"November 7, 2015",5,"Needs easier to find instructions Overall, a good app. Takes forever to figure out some things, such as how to change pictures, how to edit descriptions (there are different description fields—one is a limited summary field, and the other you have to find by swiping down, called detailed description). To edit a photo, you have to click on it in view mode. But  no where does it tell you that. It was just guesswork on my part. A ""how to use this app"" section would help immensely, thus only 4 stars from me."
5638,meghannoward,"January 14, 2016",5,Great service but horrible app Airbnb is fantastic so don't get me wrong...love the service. But the app is so buggy. Crashes a ton. The same listings appear over and over again with different prices. And I absolutely HATE that when I click a listing to view more info and then click back it takes me to the beginning of the search results. That is quickly turning me off from the whole thing. I shouldn't have to scroll for 5 pages every time I go back. That's an easy fix...hope to see it happen soon.

I find more times than not, the field ""other"" has the information I need to know when looking for a place to book.

We needed a room for 1 night so I used that as a filter. I tried booking a listing that states it's available and the reply is they don't rent for single nights, and it's booked already. Really? Then why post it? It was available on your calendar. Not very accurate. I tried another listing and I got the same reply. These were for whole houses. The second one actually said it was too expensive for one night to which I emailed back let me know what the number is and I'm sure we can make it work. Well I'm still waiting on that reply. "

The Inbox is where all communications with current, past, and potential guests happen. Without that communication there would be no guests, and no business. In fact, communicating with guests is THE one thing that an owner needs to do daily, often several times a day! Please move the Inbox to its own tab like the other BnB apps have. Better yet, why not make the toolbar user customizable? Yes, only 3 stars is rash for just 1 misplaced feature but it's a major feature, probably the most important for the mobile app."

5647,Jlkia,"October 9, 2014",4,"Wonderful! I've booked w airBNB a few times now, both for business and for fun.  Each trip has been a wonderful experience.  This app could be improved however if the option to sort by price and by distance from a particular place of my choosing (ie, distance from a convention center, distance from a relative's home, etc).  I had trouble w a reservation, homeowner backed out at the last minute due to an issue w the condo.  I called the airBNB service number, was quickly given a refund and was assisted in finding a compatible rental.  I will definitely continue to book thru airBNB."
5648,NM gardener,"November 8, 2015",5,"Easy and Convenient I love how he app notifies me when we have a reservation request, allows us to update our calendar and listing. It's easy to send messages to guests and to research our next trip out of town. I highly recommend both Air BnB ( if you have he right kind of space and he time to make it special) and also the app."
5649,mel340,"September 19, 2016",3,"Love the service, app buggy I'm an early user to the service and recently changes to hosting. Love the service, but the mobile app is buggy. Odd navigation, hard to find FAQ or service numbers. I'm also experiencing the same issue as others, it looks like I have a message on the mobile app, but there's not an actual new messaged. Tried to delete the app, go to the web app to update and get rid of the notifications and re-installed the mobile app. I still have a phantom message notification on the mobile app. AArgh!! I sent through a screen shot and a complaint about the mobile app but I got a robo-reply to that email."
5650,Madztran,"December 15, 2016",1,"Highly disappointed The customer service end and policy that Airbnb holds is ridiculous. My account got deactivated due to mistakingly creating a 2nd account (forgetting I made the 1st one). This was flagged by airbnb for identity issues - which I totally understand. However, I have reached out via email and phone numerous times trying to explain the situation in hopes to have my account reactivated. The lack of communication from Airbnb and the policy stating that they do not have to give an explanation into why an account can be suspended/deactivated is unfair for situations like mine - especially when I have booked through Airbnb & had great reviews as a guest. After researching this issue, I have found many others experiencing the same situation as mine. Airbnb, you've done us wrong."
5651,FionaBledsoe,"March 26, 2017",5,"Great App Airbnb is genius and better now than ever before. With not just places to stay but now offering experiences you can purchase, this is the next generation of traveling. I can only imagine where the company will go from here. My advice is that, if you are new to it, browse and research before you book anything...reviews and ratings can tell a story all their own. I recommend this app to anyone looking to travel on the cheap and for a cool new experience you couldn't get from a Hilton, etc. "
5652,homeless traveller,"April 24, 2017",1,"I cancelled my account I tried over a period of several weeks to get adequate information about potential rentals.  Here's what I learned. I discovered that cats are most often not pets in pet friendly listings, that owners can reject a booking listed as available because they decided to entertain friends instead, that Airbnb apparently requires you to allow an ongoing connection between a PayPal acct. and their site if you use Paypal to attempt to pay, they keep a full month' rent if there is a cancellation regardless of lead time of several months and they do not offer travel insurance, and they strip your emails between potential renters of any contact information which might enable a willing renter and landlord to confirm details of the booking before contracting."
5653,Oliver1973W,"August 26, 2017",3,Good and bad The app is relatively easy to use although it could use some streamlining. Especially when it comes to pricing and setting minimum stays etc.  The pricing is very good so if it were easier to use I would have all guests (even regulars) book through airbnb.  The constant threats of suspension are unacceptable. Being bound to 5 star reviews is absurd as many people will bring a review star down simply because they didn't like the brand of coffee etc.  If this continues I will have to go back to booking my apt outside of airbnb.  Also the calendar should be easier to share and to sync.  It is an unnecessarily difficult process.
5654,Addicted to Software,"July 6, 2012",1,Fantastic service but app is regressing I stayed at two Airbnb-listed properties in Manhattan earlier this year -- fantastic experiences.  
5655,AmericanUnderGod,"October 10, 2013",5,"Love the App and Customer Service I know there are limitations to the iPhone app but they are minor compared to fact that even though I don't book everyone who inquires, so many people are able to search for and view my property. "
5656,Behind the scene,"January 9, 2016",1,"Can’t Log Out or Change Users!!! Don’t get me wrong, I use Airbnb extensively and think the company and their business model are fantastic. However, their mobile app is lacking in the most basic feature, the inability to log out or change users.  It’s absolutely ridiculous!  I logged in on my wife’s iPad to check a reservation I had made, now she’s unable to use the Airbnb app for her travel.  We’ve tried deleting the app (and it’s data) and reinstalling it, but my profile is automatically re-populated.  As such, the app is now useless to my wife. To say this is frustrating is an understatement.  For a company which is valued at over 40 billion dollars, and 1 million customers using their service each night, their app is unacceptable."
5657,Hosting and traveling,"May 4, 2016",3,"Good but... I like this app, I feel it's pretty user friendly, and there are only a few things that it won't accomplish and you need to do on an actual desktop. However, it was inconsistent with notifications. I didn't get notifications often about someone messaging me or changing something, then I would later. It seemed the activity on my account was not necessarily up to date. Also I can't fathom why air bnb has not made it possible to add an extra charge when people are bringing pets. So I have to log in to it on my desktop every time someone brings one to charge the extra pet fee. Grr but otherwise pretty good."
5658,Dwanjabi,"September 9, 2016",3,"great but needs tweaking overall this app is great.  there are a few bugs that could use some tweaking.  i use it primarily as a host.  the badge that appears on the app icon remains even after i have checked all messages and cleared all reservation requests. this is both when i check all the messages, etc within the app AND when i check it on my laptop at a standard website.  App developers please tweak the app so it refreshes to reflect when all has been checked so the badge will disappear from the app icon...so i don't have to keep having false leads as if there is a new message or booking request.  thank you."
5659,Tammy From Miami,"October 2, 2016",1,"Not happy I am very unhappy with this app. For starters I can't find any one beside the host to answer my questions . He advertised an entire property. Prior to booking I tried getting in contact with him , no response . So I booked any way. The originally ad said entire property , but once I reserved and asked him to contact me, that is when he advised me it's is a private room with a room mate ! That is false advertisement !! After I told him I didn't see that in the add , his response was I should learn how to read. Now I am uncomfortable, it's is the day of check in and he isn't even responding as far as what time I can check in . This reservation is close to 500$ and I don't think it's fair that I am being treated like this! Never again will I use or refer anyone to this app!"
5660,sroszell,"November 17, 2016",5,"Great App, poor service I have emailed Airbnb several times about listing 2 rooms together. Either I have to choose 'Entire House' or a single room. Guests do not choose the listing if they think it's only 1 room, or they cancel when they realize it is not an 'entire house'. (In all fairness to AirBnB, they have generated many responses and we still get 5-star ratings, so they must have bigger concerns). However, it frustrates both hosts and guests. Another choice for 'alternative arrangements' or 'other' would seem to be an easy fix."
5661,Toko Decor,"January 25, 2017",1,"Sucking money over $1300 I have Booked Villa in Bali through this travel agency; it turned out the Villa is very unfit for people who has asthma like me, it's smell rotten.. it feel, smell  dampened all around the rooms walls!  So I called the owner about my situation; telling her that if I stay in that room I probably end up in emergency room, may die from my asthma! She said that she's going to think about it because she was in LA at that time; few days later she replied to me that she refuse to refund anything to me I paid total US$1300!!  Not even refund me half of it that she promised me too!  "
5662,Teufelskatze101,"April 4, 2017",5,"Convenient app I'm a host for Airbnb, and this app makes it very easy to manage my listing. I haven't used Airbnb as a guest yet, so I can't comment on the features of booking. But so far, it has been very smooth. My guests have all been very sweet and respectful. The only complaint I have is that customer service numbers are very hard to find. I had a guest who accidentally booked the wrong date, and it took us forever to get a number to figure out how to change the booking. But overall, I'm very happy with this app."
5663,frankcharlton,"August 25, 2017",2,"What happened? The Air BnB app used to be such a joy to use. It was a super simple, clean UI that worked smoothly. Now way too much is jammed into the UI that it's hard to execute even the simplest of searches for somewhere to stay. There are image recycling issues so that trying to scroll through a list just results in jittery slow scrolling. Using the map and selecting ""redo search"" completely searches outside of the bounds you set, sometimes jumping an entire state over. On top of these performance and functionality issues you still can't search by keyword after all this time. You can't type ""cabin"" and get results, but sure let's create ""experiences"" that no one wants."
5664,Rdquintero,"September 8, 2012",5,My first time. So after a few months of worry about how my trips would play out using this service I am happy to report that I am more than pleased.  My first stop was to Susana's in Alfama Portugal. It was exactly as described and she was very kind and generous to us. Two bottles of  wine ( table and Port) that were wonderful iced tea and water. Oh yes and half a dozen fresh peaches! What a love. Next Barcelona with Tere. First of all she picked us up at the airport and her rental was perfect clean and very well decorated. Full of amenities and Wifi! I'm super happy that we used this valuable service!
5665,KBaby118,"April 22, 2014",5,"Greatest App! We travel a lot and because we have 3 kids, we usually have to get 2 hotel rooms. It adds up so quickly. With AirBNB we can find houses that cost the same amount as 1 hotel room but they have a full kitchen so we can cook for our picky eaters and the money we spend goes to a family instead of a big corporation. I love this app! No matter where we travel I can find awesome homes for my family to stay in. The app is so well designed it's easy to find and filter your search. Best travel app ever!!!"
5666,lvp<3c,"July 2, 2014",5,"Really good app When using the app make sure to select entire apt or private room, advice to share room only if your budget is low. The place I have stayed are very nice. Make sure to get someone (a friend who is already using airbnb) to refer you to sign up so both of you get 25 dollars off. Make sure to read the reviews of the host before booking as they do tell you a lot about a place. I must admit there can be horrible places but most postings on airbnb especially with good reviews are in fact really really good. Bon voyage"
5667,suprchargr77,"June 26, 2015",5,"You get what you pay for... The truth is, if you know what you want and you're willing to pay for it, you can get it. I've never had a bad experience with AirBnB; but I also tend to only rent the ""entire place"", and I don't do cheap. That being said, when you can get a whole apartment or house for the price of a hotel room, it can't be beat. And the app...besides the fact that it occasionally gives you fewer options and you have to reload your request to see everything, it's a great app."
5668,cupcakewalk,"April 16, 2016",3,"3.5 Stars: Better than Nothing; Could be Better As an Airbnb host I have a love-hate relationship with Airbnb. It's the same with the Airbnb app. It's great to have when I am not at my computer and need to address hosting issues, especially responding to inquiries and reservation requests. Airbnb forces hosts to reply rather quickly, so having the app assists."

My customer service experience has been A+. They have resolved any and all issues I've encountered and even paid for damages from a guest. I truly love their customer support and resolution process. The app has been acting a bit funny for a couple of days but remains fully functional. Overall I'm enjoying my experience as a host and have hit consistent numbers for the past quarter. Profitable

5673,Lazy arrow,"March 10, 2017",3,"Quirky I like the convenience of having an App and being able to communicate with our guests anytime, anywhere. However this app is very quirky, buggy. Some request show up and others don't. If you have any questions that arise that are not normal i.e. Refunds, change of dates etc. sometimes they show up on the app and other times they don't so I don't get all of my messages on the app. Also as a guest, you can't always see host choices. The map doesn't show up that shows all the hosts. Our listing sometimes doesn't show up on the host listing. So I'm glad I have the App but I wish it was more efficient."
5674,Julia Eagles,"January 26, 2013",5,"Easy to manage reservations at my fingertips! We recently started using Airbnb to rent out an extra room in our house. Not only have we enjoyed hosting interesting guests in our homes, but Airbnb makes the whole process a snap! I get text message alerts whenever some inquires about renting the room, and can easily respond or look for more information on the app. It make it easy to manage our posting from anywhere! We use both the iPhone and iPad apps, in addition to the website."
5675,Opium1984,"May 29, 2013",3,"Missing some important features This app is missing practical features essential for hosts. For example, there is no way to manage your inbox (delete messages) or check your account ($) details- i.e. past and future payments. I also suggest giving the option to NOT leave a review for someone without having that distracting notification number just sitting there forever. This last suggestion may seem trivial to some, but as a busy host I find the notification alert a useful reminder. However, having it there permanently nullifies this otherwise convenient function. Thank you."
5676,Carleyking,"August 22, 2016",5,"Thankful for the opportunities this app gives I first started using this app when I was 19, most places we wanted to go to legally required you to be 21 or older to book a (decent) hotel room or have a lot of paperwork/cash safety deposit. I can hands down thank this app for giving me a safe, reliable place to sleep at night. Whether it be going to a last minute concert, an apartment in the middle of a city or just a place out of town for a relaxing getaway. I always feel safe and reassured using this app!"
5677,ZCar11,"September 17, 2016",1,"No integrity Company Company doesn't verify the host can legally lease the property to guests.  The company could write an algorithm to verify the host owns the property since ownership information of all properties in America are public information (worldwide listing is another issue). This would essentially drop over 50-75% of their listings in America since most property owners are unaware of their property being used for short term stays.  More importantly, the tenant has not been granted authorization to host the property or room. This company chooses not to due to greed.  Airbnb keep being pleading ignorance of this major issue for the $$$$$'s.  Just like any other old, stodgy company:   Chase the all mighty dollar and make as much money as possible.....who cares about the legitimacy of how we earn those dollars."
5678,MohammadA.Ali,"October 2, 2016",1,"Terrible Customer Service Let me preface this by saying I had a friend reserve a space with Airbnb and it ended up being closed by the county because it wasn't up to safety standards. I thought that was a one time mishap, after getting into a dispute over a broken mirror the host tried to charge us $1100 to replace it. After calling to get more information about the issue the service person kept saying ""no"" even before I could finish my sentence. I asked to speak with the manager to which I received another no and then got hung up on. If you still are going to use this service, make sure nothing goes wrong or else you will regret having to deal with their customer service. Hands down the worst experience I have ever received."

5680,Tremma01,"January 31, 2017",5,Good app. Needs some ergonomic improvement I like the application with a few exceptions. 1) needs better Human support that is more responsive for hosts 2) the process for collecting taxes is not simple or even supported and something should be done for this 3) special offer support is not obvious when a renter is trying to book and difficult to manipulate unless you have done it once prior.4) not enough analytics given back to the host like their competition offers to make intelligent decisions on pricing and market trends.

You have to link with facebook (or 3 other sites hardly anyone uses) to match your profile pic with your official ID. The facebook button simply did not work. I finally switched to my laptop, where the facebook verification STILL didn't work, but thankfully the website has a gmail verification option that worked.

Airbnb will slowly update their app and company to better suit hosts and guests. Maybe the developers should try traveling, use the app, and update it based on experience. That'd be a great start. I'll use other similar companies in the meantime in conjunction with this app/company. They have great advertising so more people use this app but eventually, someone better will create a better version, and I'm looking forward to it. Until then, this works good enough"

When showing this to a taxi driver or any human they don't understand longitude and latitude. Why would you design it this way? This is especially terrible in foreign counties #2 all basic information should be made available offline - location, house amenities, house guide, and your inbox of messages. When traveling in a foreign country I didn't have wifi and couldn't access the host msgs that had directions on how to enter the home. Please fix this asap."

However, if you book a room and it is not available for the nights you want it, then you cancel said reservation and rebook it for only the night that it is available, the app says that you cannot rebook because you already have booked it. Hmmmm...so I called customer service ( on hold 7 minutes) to find out that the app is riddled with glitches and bugs and that it is best to open air b&b in a web browser and avoid the app. When I opened in a web browser it showed my pending request but it will not appear in the app. They told me that it will be some time before the app is fully functioning."

You can't set your pricing or change your pictures, and for some strange reason when I look at the app my listing says ""$125/month"" when it's actually ""$125/night"". Whatever.

As an owner you have very limited capabilities to provide a decent quote. They don't Bette the renters.
