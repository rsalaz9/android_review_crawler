1,sconnell2,"November 12, 2017",5,"Good App for Topical News This app is not as good or user friendly as the 5-star Zite app it consumed and killed, but it is OK a for finding news on specific topics that may be of personal or professional interest, often that you may not find elsewhere (the main reason I use this app). There seem to be some bugs involving sharing via social media where the headlines don't show up, just an abbreviated link. The web interface on a desktop is sometimes better & more usable than the iPhone app in some ways. Linked articles where ads cover so much of the screen I can't see the article & the ad won't close without opening in safari can be a problem. Also, I have subscribed to a bunch of ""channels"" that seem to have gone dormant with no new content for months & find that it's difficult to unsubscribe or even move them to the bottom so they're at least out of the way. Would be nice if it were easier to organize or delete these saved topics (especially for those of us who follow a lot)"

I constantly have to exit the app to check the time or to see how much charge my battery is at. I get that you want to make a more “enriching” or more “ immersive” experience. But it’s annoying, and now with the latest update the default board is “for you” and I don’t like that. I want to see the news and what’s happening not what flip board servers have decided what I might be interested in. Use to love this app now it’s just going down hill fast."

6,_hauk,"February 21, 2018",5,"A little bit shady Flipboard asked me to rate the app in an in-app pop up. Trying to submit 1 star was not allowed. That’s a bit shady. What I don’t like is that the app sends you to the publisher to read the article. This is bad because any ad-blocker u might have installed in Safari does not work in Flipboards “web-browser”. So to read an article you end up downloading megabytes of ads and ad-tracking scripts from every publisher. That is, unless the publisher has an agreement with Flipboard, in which case Flipboard inserts its own full page ads you cannot pinch out of. The whole Flipboard experience can therefore be very _bad_ for your data plan and for your privacy. That said, Flipboard is very useful and gives you the opportunity to browse through articles within topics of interest in a very nice way. Apples own News app is a strong contender though, but for now I do prefer Flipboard."

12,Sam G in Austin Texas,"August 21, 2018",5,"Flipboard is indispensable to me I first installed Flipboard on my iPad in 2011. It was one of the first apps installed on my first iPad, and I’ve used Flipboard more or less every day since August 2011, through the present (August 2018). I find Flipboard indispensable to using my iPad. Flipboard’s a staff skillfully curates a very broad range of news about current events and also features a huge variety of special interest magazines and articles, and is markedly superior to all other news magazine apps I’ve seen. I am often surprised by how quickly Flipboard posts news about current events, usually incredibly rapidly after the reported events have occurred. My iPad would be much less useful, and much less fun to use, if Flipboard were ever unavailable to me. Thank you Flipboard staff for making and maintaining such a great app."

A major accomplishment in my view."
17,Ewill20,"November 3, 2019",2,"Not “Flip”-Board Anymore The new app design, which I opted to try, scrolls instead of flips which sort of goes against the original idea.  The original app was great, easy-to-use and customize.  Over the past few years the app has gotten increasingly more difficult to use with some settings buried in non-sensical places.  The app is also ridiculously littered with ads, it’s very frustrating seeing multiple ads at one time.  Another gripe I have is the app seems to highlight or push articles by the New York Times and others that cost money and have a pop-up blocking the article.  They have other news agencies that don’t charge for a subscription buried or not shown at all.  When I try to mute these sources (one setting that’s annoyingly difficult to locate) they don’t always get muted.  I’ve always liked the app for aesthetics and having so many sources in one place, but the changes they keep implementing is making the app worse, not better."

But, PLEASE be up front about it.  Do NOT do “promoted” stories that are disclosed as promoted in smaller, lighter print.  I’m thinking of Casper mattresses, for example.  I’ll be buying a new foam mattress this year, but NOT a Casper one, because of the advertising deceptively printed as a news story.  My major was marketing.  I love clever advertising.   I even like targeted advertising, but PLEASE, stop making advertising look like news stories.  Here’s an idea:  Put your ad at the top of a news story.  Let me decide if I’m interested enough that I click on it, or scroll quickly past it (maybe as a single guy, I just have no interest in the latest wireless bra right now)."

I also updated the Flipboard app to the current one and that’s when the problems begun. The app is MUCH slower than the previous one. It takes long time to load ANY article from any source. There is also no option to block pop-ups (or at least one that works) so you are bombarded with ads and subscription nags. Come on Flipboard, blocking pop up ads is easy and almost every other browser has it. Another annoyance that still persists is the inability to disable the Cover stories. Let me choose what I want to read please. Seems like the best version was the original version. Downhill since then. Two stars, hope you can fix your problems so I can change it to five.

(Today: A biopic of the Walton family in my topic of “olive oil”.) And worse: I very purposely don’t follow any political topics on this app, but I get almost daily notifications such as “for you in conservative views”.

Update Oct. 24, 2019:  Again, although the format and style of this app is great, it is so filthy ridden within advertisements that it is rendered almost unusable. You often have to wait a very long time for an article to become readable as the multitude of ads and pop-ups load. Sometimes there are so many ads loading that the article hangs and never becomes readable.  This is not necessary. Other apps, such as Microsoft News seem to be able to include advertising without interupting the articles or being intrusive. Flipboard authors try to blame this on external sites that they have no control over. Baloney! Clean this up Flipboard and you could be a model for a fine app.  As it is, it stinks."

The new design is boring though. I like flipping through the articles, it’s called Flipboard for that reason but the new scroll down design doesn’t feel as good. Several things also change like when I enter my magazine, the new design is too boring with the description at the top and immediately you see the articles. I like the old design where the first page is the description of my magazine and the last article’s photo is displayed over the entire screen giving it a very nice modern look. The old design is just superior to the new boring scroll one. Let’s keep the flips please."

If they were to do this sort of thing, then there is no telling how convenient it would be for all those who would rather read the digital version of them depending on how they learn. It would also be most convenient because no matter what type of magazine that they would want to read, that then they would all always still be available for them on the app itself regardless of the type of magazine it is that they would want to read."

That being said, I would open the app and see Progressive editor choice articles.  Today when I opened up the app there was a child who was part of the FL school massacre on the top of the app.  Many of us in this country view the use of these kids to push an agenda as child abuse.  They can be seen reading off talking points and being interviewed after shooting- it's reprehensible that these stories are published.  Enough.  It was so distasteful to have this content pushed in front of me.   It is sad that this company thinks it is ok to promote its agenda through this fashion; again this was the ’editors choice.’   I see companies on both sides of the political spectrum using this model, and I refuse to give them ad revenue. Just the way I feel about these news apps.  Uninstalled."

At first I thought it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world to know what the other side is reading. But by God. What? Need I really dodge Tucker Carlson’s pearls of wisdom every time I open this app? This is what my app usage boils down to: I’ll read a crazy headline and think “what!?”, look more closely, and then confirm that the source is far from reputable, flip on, repeat. And for some reason, I can’t simply make it so the culprit never makes it to my screen again. Why? What y’all need to do to make this app better is to allow users to silence (at a very minimum) the glaring propaganda. Because, I don’t know, democracy? Your move, Flipboard."

However, I’ve gotten to where I don't like using it as much as I used to. When I open articles to read them I’m constantly being bombarded with ads. These ads are generally embedded within the articles, but the bottom of the articles also have utterly ridiculous ads. I can’t see how these are coming from the websites since they are nearly the same ads for every article. It doesn’t matter if I’m on WiFi or on cellular, the ads are annoyingly the same. I even use two ad blockers. I cannot figure out how to suppress them. I would like for Flipboard to provide a mechanism for removing the ads, like other apps such as the MSN News app and the Apple News app. Until then, I’m going to move away from Flipboard."

My big problem is with customization. When you first start the app, it lets you select from hundreds of topics to follow, and then...it shows you topics you don’t want to follow. There is a “muting” function, but it doesn’t work. I mute a source, and a couple of days later, the source is back. You can also have it “show less” or “show more” of stories covering a topic, but the app decides which topics are covered in the story. A story about sexual harassment won’t have “sexual harassment” in the list of topics you can choose to see more of. I spend much more time muting and trying to see less of topics then I actually spend reading stories."

Increasingly, I am “tripping over” ads while scrolling - accidentally triggering ads which are not often visible until I’ve tried to scroll, and then the ad experience takes over the app and cannot be backed out of. I must return home and browse back to my article. Sometimes that’s not enough, the ad persists to own the screen.

Today I was simply trying to read a Reuter’s article and I couldn’t even finish it due to the popups. I just want to read the news. You’ve forced me to switch to Apple News which I didn’t want to do but will."

I will go back to the new version only if the traditional move from news articles is cleaner and smoother. ( check the Apple news for reference )
60,Brosef87,"September 8, 2017",4,"Thanks for the redesign Just wanted to take a moment and thank the Flipboard team for doing the right thing, which is redesigning their UX/UI so that it more closely resembled their layout of the past. It feels much more intuitive to use."
61,SaguaroJoe,"October 17, 2017",5,"UI is maddening I rarely get to the end of an article more than a page or two long. Either my fingers touch the wrong control by mistake or I have to close the app for the moment.  It is very difficult to get back to the place I was or to even find the article I was reading. The format is interesting, the graphics appealing but try to get back where you were and it becomes very difficult to impossible. I don’t use this app to be wowed. My number one priority is to read the articles. The people who designed this app seem to be enthralled by their cleverness.  Bad model."
62,Hungry2hear,"January 1, 2018",5,"Absolutely addictive What a concept-the ability to peruse news sources and magazines on any topic, from everywhere, for any hobby or interest, and to read news and opinions from all sides of the political perspective, including from foreign sources, all at ones fingertips.   And to also be able to archive articles in your own personal mag is just brilliant. "
63,CVP0,"May 29, 2018",4,"Not completely what I need For me, it’s good but not quite what I want/need. I want an experience where I can see all my magazine/sources in one Flipboard like it’s one big magazine. I use a new app for news and it’s presented in a “newspaper” design. However flipboard doesn’t really feel like a magazine save for the page turning motion. I can pick a garden magazine, or a science magazine, but I just want an option to load up one magazine with all my interests in it, instead I’m presented with a main start page with all my interests for me to pick from individually. Not a major fault, it’s otherwise a fantastic app and I highly recommend it. It’s nearly perfect. Give it a try."
64,StevieYouin,"September 2, 2018",4,"Great, but ads need work! I love using this for good information all in one area. It’s nice being able to choose the categories you want to read about.

They take up my whole phone and prevent me from reading the articles."

That's what it's like to use Flipboard. Expect to have discussions vanish if they become heated. Literally the entire flip hidden from public view. If you somehow find it again through Batman level detective tenacity, it will inform you that it's suddenly ""Hidden Sources"" even though you have no hidden sources. Try Googling the words ""Flipboard Hidden Sources"". No hits? That's weird. You'll be gaslighted when you complain about this or be patronized and told ""We're looking into it."" Go use News Republic or Apple News. I regret ever reinstalling this garbage. Oh, Google that too. ""Flipboard garbage"" ""Flipboard toxic"" ""Flipboard worst news aggregator"".

Flipboard once was one of my favorite news apps for various articles with differing views, articles of interest and how-to information, but now has become a nuisance of ads and must have subscriptions to read articles posted on a open news app. Many articles now seem to be nothing more than a trap for ads than journalism.

The creation of personalized ""magazines"" is easy and I regularly find myself referring back to articles I've read and tagged. Only real downside is that a some of sources are pay wall, but it seems to reset from time to time so for instance I might be blocked on Wall Street Journal one day but a week or so later, I can read it. Another thing I really like is how many independent sources there are, so you can really mix it up. I have all sorts of stuff from electric propulsion, to astronomy, to woodworking, to investing in AI."

It had an excellent interface which can be quite addicting because you can fly through article after article. I do wish there was a bit more variety of quality articles, but that is a bit subjective. The reason I am giving this three stars is there has been a recent influx of advertisements that are planted in the middle of the screen and activate on the slightest touch while skimming though articles. These ads send me out of the app and into the appstore without even asking me if that’s okay and it gets frustrating."

But in the last year the service keeps pushing more and more garbage at me. It keeps adding local radio stations and newspapers in podunk towns in the US, UK, Australia, and India, which are full of irrelevant stories. Plus it keeps adding marketing sites; political advocacy sites; and other questionable, low-quality stuff that is definitely not news. And pushing topics I have no interest in like gaming and blockchain even though I keep doing the Show Less thing."

To be able to have new, timely content personally assembled specifically for me and my personal interests, from across the vast number of internet providers is akin to the scene in The Matrix where Neo ‘learns’ martial arts in a matter of seconds.I never have to spend countless hours hopping from site to site looking for material on a very precise subject. Flipboard does the heavy lifting and I get all of the enjoyment of learning at lightning speed. A warning though, this app could jeopardize your relationship with your partner, unless you get them hooked as well! Armani 50"

And didn’t have ANY advertising BS to deal with), and I was forced to become a user of flipboard. The ads have progressively gotten worse again, though this time from the platform itself. I stopped using and uninstalled it before because of the major use of literally constant intrusive advertising by the content providers within the articles themselves. Now, it’s flipboard itself. There are even video ads now at the top of the screen- the home screen of the platform!!! Are you kidding me?? Don’t make a mistake trying to X it out- it’ll take you to the top of the feed and you’ll have to start all over again. Pathetic! Uninstalling once again. Shame on you, flipboard!!"

It was only greatness as fast as you could flip.  And when they added tuning options it was just about perfect.  Apple and Flipboard stopped updating that old iPod, and so I get to compare the classic to this hunk of garbage that abuses my eyeballs every chance it gets.  For that it dropped two stars.  "

Nowadays, not only are the SPONSORED ADS out-numbering the actual articles, even worse, there are a GROWING number of BS articles, that lets face it, simply are a PAID ON THE BACK END endorsement/advertisement for a product or brand. It doesn’t take a genius to see this activity. Frankly, I’ve grown weary of having to weed-through all the BS in this app, so I don’t use it like I used to. I rate a 2 instead of a 1 because the layout is nice, that’s it. There are better news feeds out there."
80,Maglit,"October 14, 2017",5,"AdSense has ruined the experience I used to love Flipboard and used it regularly on my iPhone. However, no more. The iOS app has been rendered in usable on the iPhone by invasive and aggressive advertising from AdSense. These ads block the entire page load taking up the entire screen of the phone and there is no way to click through to the articles one wants to read. Flipboard needs to have AdSense correctly format the ads so that content can be viewed on phones. Until that happens the user experience is horrible and that’s a shame."
81,Frankie_Nevada,"January 7, 2018",2,"Some Really Annoying Features I really get annoyed when you click on an article; and then you can only read if you sign up for something ... especially from The NY Times ... and there are others! I really do not like “pop ups” when you’re in the middle of an article. I especially dislike it when I am reading an article and a get a “pop up” that says I have won a $1,000 gift card if I can answer three questions. I answer then incorrectly; but yet, I still “win”. I never go further. Then, when I select an article to read, I’m not sure what area to hit on my iPad screen. It seems like it is different for different articles. I like Flipboard; and will continue using at in spite of these annoying features!"
82,Solon212,"June 17, 2018",1,"Deficient I just deleted this app after using it for years.  I got tired of seeing the same story by many different sources, 2 or 3 maybe, but 4 or more is too many.   News that has moved on is often presented with an older versions still appearing.  Comments which I used to like have become abusive where people are viciously attacked for their views.  Many, far too many resort to using vulgar insults.  Also it’s obvious that people react to the headline and then post their comment without having read the entire article.  Another irritation is an article said to be a day old has actually been for posted many previous times, It’s too bad because with a little thought these problems could be fixed, but when an app becomes irritant it must go."
83,mrcran,"June 26, 2018",2,"Too much advertising. This used to be a great app, with great flexibility and customizable options for your favorite news topics. However, the advertising from articles has been getting worse. It is a great idea that you are able to report intrusive advertising within the article, but it doesn’t help if you have to do it after every other article. And now articles from the Washington Post and the New York Times are blocking the article in order for you to subscribe to their news magazine. I must admit it is getting ridiculous at this point, I haven’t had any problems like this with the Apple news app. Maybe Flipboard will improve in the near future but for now it doesn’t seem worth it."
84,Bread 2.0,"July 31, 2018",5,"I already love it I just got this app and I already love it. Here’s why: Every other news app makes you bounce between topics, while all your topics are shuffled together on the “for you” section on Flipboard. This makes the experience much faster, as I don’t have to keep scrolling to find an article I might be interested in. And if I don’t like an article that’s in my section I just flip it away. It’s very easy to use, and takes the hassle out of fishing through the news for what you’re really looking for. 5 stars all the way!!"
85,Kamin123,"October 23, 2018",2,"Interesting idea but too messy to find relevant content Interests are found based on hashtags making it include 90% of material not really related to interests.  Most published content has inaccurate hashtags to attract traffic.  It seems this throws off the Flipboard dynamic. Very difficult to find relevant content based on interests chosen.  Also, the region setting doesn't help.  In technology, the majority of stories are from India-based companies and activities.  None of that is relevant to the tech market I am in located in the U.S.  Takes too much time to try to train it.  Just like web search engines, more provides worse results.  More is not better when searching or discovering new content.  Focused content and results would be far better."

I keep selecting show me less “autos” and I get more and more news about “autos”, even articles that have nothing to do with “autos” but have the hashtag “autos”. I report as off topic, but it does no good. I suppose the app is great for people who really don’t mind, and just glibly play along. Come on, Flipboard. Fix your service. As far as following up with Flipboard regarding fine tuning. I have complained directly with Flipboard in the past, a few times. The app seems to get worse. How about fixing your app and stop trying to placate your users. Admit it. You like the revenue stream from clicks so much, that you don’t care how you get them as long as people keep clicking."

I get various feeds throughout the day (way too many — truth be told).  As I browse articles, I select those that I would like to read in the resident Flipboard reader, but the feed reader fails nearly every time to locate, load, and handoff to the resident app reader on my iPhone.  Most of the time, it fails to recognize that their reader app is even loaded locally, and tries to load their browser-based reader.  This requires logging in and is quite resource consumptive.   I am certain that the developer can do better than this if they put their mind to it.  Until then, I remain quite underwhelmed and disappointed.  Don’t bother downloading this one until all this is fixed."

I couldn’t figure out why I kept accidentally clicking the “visit site” button and launching a browser to see ads.   Then I noticed it.   The app tracks where your finger is scrolling then about every 5 or so flips insets the ad in the panel your finger is flipping from.  The greatly increases the chance you will accidentally click the ad and bingo result in revenue for the app.   Meanwhile you are now being tracked as liking that product and bing targeted outside Flipboard even though you have not interest in the product.   For that covert click bait design I give this 2 stars.   Good app, bad ethical marketing implementation."

92,Jaime non pollo,"October 7, 2018",1,"I’m dumping this app! When Flipboard first appeared, it was a useful jumping-off point for lots of interesting articles and sites on the internet. It has since become the digital equivalent of the trashy tabloid mags you see at the checkout line at the grocery. That and the plethora of pop-up ads (some that are full page and don’t disappear until you quit the article and re-click)distracting videos that update while you’re trying to read and make the page jump around, and articles that go nowhere but bombard you with ads, make this app almost unreadable. If you happen to find an ad that you’re interested in and you click on it, you will see that ad for the next month on every 3rd or 4th page. Bye bye Flipboard!"
93,A typing monkey,"January 5, 2019",1,"Ads ruin it The app is the best looking app for this kind of media, but the ads ABSOLUTELY ruin the experience. The one page Flipboard related pop ups I can ignore for this review (I wish I could pay to remove those though), but the way the pages are loaded are so obnoxiously filled with ads most of the time that it becomes a chore just to try to find the reading material buried within. There really are more ads than content most of the time. I know the amount varies depending on the source, but overall the experience is not good. Please allow us the option to open articles in Safari Reader view by default if there is no way for you to implement a system wide default that matches the fantastic quality of the rest of the app."
94,Thingsyourollup,"January 23, 2019",1,Buggy and invasive ads How come Flipboard refuses to do anything to combat some of the invasive advertising on here?  Also why will Flipboard never fix the issue with comment notifications?  You try to look at a reply to your comment and an unhideable keyboard opens up on top of the comments and it doesn’t even take you to yours.  And since you can’t close the keyboard you have to force close the app. I guess it’s for the best though.  75% of all comments on any given article are toxic and political - regardless of whether or not the article even had anything at all to do with politics.  Read an article about different ways to cook chicken?  The comments would have you believe the article was about Trump or Hillary’s emails.  Completely irrelevant.
95,Sifeaf,"February 4, 2019",5,Apt Great! Their customer service actually responds and makes changes. I enjoy the service. One of thing I enjoy is with the use of a language translation program.

97,AngelJC.,"January 5, 2020",4,"Change this please! I love this app. I use it and it’s widget everyday. However, one thing that’s bugs me is the swipe gesture. While reading, you can swipe the current article away to go back to the previous article or the home page. The problem is that it happens accidentally more often than on purpose. I believe the problem is because you can swipe from any part of the screen. Perhaps it would be better if the swipe was activated closer to the edge of the screen. Also, it would be nice if there was a gesture to swipe back to the article I just left."

However, either the newest version of my phone operating system or the update for the app has turned it into a data sponge. Yesterday,  I somehow burned through 800megs at my desk only checking news a few times during the morning. And no videos. That much data is several movies worth of data, which is ridiculous. Today it’s already over 400megs, with just one three minute video. This needs to get fixed with the next update"
104,XIXIILXXXI,"December 15, 2018",2,"Beware the Redirect Ad Stories The app is okay but they have allowed a dangerous new ad format. The ad’s now look almost identical to stories with a photo at top, a bold headline as click bait, and a brief description mimicking the start of a news story. The only hint is the small text stating ‘advertisement’ at the lower left that’s difficult to notice. If clicked, the ad instantly redirects you out of the app and into safari with no warning dialogue and no ad blockers stop this redirect as I have tried many. Clearly the developers are aware of this as they occur every three to four flips. I assume they are profiting of a percentage of the clicks so they’ll have no desire to fix this deceitful practice... user beware."

It often seems like some of the articles aren’t written by experts at all.

I will try to read a news story and there is so many ads constantly loading and shifting the page of the story around I can hardly read it! And with more recent updates, ads will launch safari and then the App Store out of nowhere, after nothing but simply flipping through the main feed. Causing me to have to close the AppStore and safari before returning to Flipboard. Unacceptable. It’s creating a user experience than is so burdened with advertising that the Flipboard app is nearly unusable. Sad to see a solid news concept be destroyed by advertising nightmares."

They only have a small indication in grey that they are an ad. Why not put it in a red box higher up within the image like the other labels? I’ve clicked on them by mistake too many times and I am sure that’s what Flipboard wants. But disguising ads to look like articles is not a credible way of maintaining readership. This strategy will fail. Sad, because I used to enjoy Flipboard; now I find it extremely annoying. I want to be informed, not tricked. If I see an interesting ad I will click on it. But I refuse to be tricked. Change your ways Flipboard or I will find another news aggregator."

I’ve recommended to a ton of family members and would recommend it to anyone that likes to read or even check out the headlines. Thanks flipboard keep rockin!!"

I've been getting ads for both Spider Solitaire and People Magazine for Apple News+. The minute I flip to the ad, it'll automatically kick me out of the app, to an intermediate load page, and then to the Apple News app or App Store. It's incredibly frustrating and makes me give up on using the app."

The extra effort and time to do so makes me wonder why use the app at all and instead just use browser based Flipboard? For the articles that do work however, it seems like I am bombarded with advertisements making the content of the article the smallest sized content in the display! Sad to see this (de) evolution."

The point I am trying to make is that all of my categories were about food, video games, dogs, and sports. The category that you generate, that is supposed to be articles just for me, was filled with political articles leaning towards one political party when none of my categories had to do anything with politics.

After sucking 3-10 seconds of your precious life force from this moral coil a little x pops up allowing you to close the ad —— upon pressing, the app sling shots you back to the very first article you read upon opening the app. Your only recourse is to try to, very quickly, swipe past the articles.

The downside- and the one aspect that deters me from continued use is their complete failure to police the very very high number of obvious fake accounts, bots , trolls etc.  Adding to that is Flipboard’s blatant lack of responsiveness to the concerns and complaints of readers like myself.  Perhaps they want to create drama and tension ?  I don’t know- they just respond with canned platitudes.  So.

Almost quit when a login was required to actually use a program that for years didn't need it. But the final straw has broken this users ability to justify using this app. For years I could read news with minimal to no ads. Today, every single article has dozens of ads that take considerable time and data to load. Trying to zoom in on just the text causes the ads to expand over the text. It's a shame Flipboard no longer has the ability to enforce the standard it itself had set. "

Started flipping back and forth between Apple News (my former go-to) and Flipboard over many days. Hard to describe the qualitative difference, but it's definitely there. Specifically, the content on Apple feels more like Facebook. Actually, Apple's newsfeed feels like a combo of Facebook 's (bad) and Flipboard's (good), so on the continuum of good to bad, Flipboard lands on top. Glad I found it. Keep up the good work."

A great looking, well organized, and stable application that delivers news content of my personal interest. I am docking it a star due to updates that have been made over the years — each update comes across as a major overhaul with a new learning curve, and in my case, a loss of my filtering that eliminated the fluff that I was disinterested in flipping through."

I have made the suggestion to Flipboard, which was totally ignored and will probably continue to be ignored. Go figure."

I think because their current setup there is nothing like it and it forces you to focus more on stories as your flipping through. As long as I can keep the current version for myself you can do whatever you want with the new version. Otherwise count me out of using flipboard. And I have been a avid user since it’s release

Flip board went overboard prioritizing all things Russia. We’ll see how you do when it all hits the fan. Doubtful the truth will get much coverage. Flipboard has great potential, but if it’s not the desired narrative then squelch it. Crazy Trump supporter, hardly. Simply want stories from credible sources, hard to come by I know. Leaves you with few options, as most mainstream stream media is opinion and conjecture. Guess that knocks out most yet falls inline with Flipboard MO. Sorry for the criticalness, but you solicited feedback and this is my perspective, please prove me wrong."

Content is entertaining or informative, serious or light depending upon one’s choices. The rating of 4 rather than 5 stars is the result of occasionally tapping on a story only to find that one must subscribe to the publication or site in order to read the content. The headline that catches the eye is little more than a come-on rather like a trick advertisement."

Not only did I use it myself, but my high school students used FlipBoard to keep up on current events and share research. Sadly, I will not be recommending the app to them this term. FlipBoard has lost its functionality and charm. Now it is just an index of timely news webpages. Google can do that for me and Apple makes reading easier.

Over time the UI has gotten way more sophisticated and they’ve grown their user base by orders of magnitude. Time to make some money! Ads and pop ups run ramped through every article to the point of distraction, not to mention the inadvertent tap on one of those ads will take you into a whole other dimension where getting back to the original article takes a lot of effort, if you can even find it again. Still, its good for killing time while standing in line, etc. so I’ll put up with it but I use it way less than I used to."

Most significantly are the increasing number of annoying and intrusive ads & videos. I also hate the deceptive ads that are disguised to look like news stories. Also, for some articles the interface changes into non-flip scrolling with even more intrusive ads. Clearly, Flipboard’s business model is failing- they are losing control of the user experience, which is what has made the app so desirable. I suggest they try a subscription model where one could choose to pay to reduce ads and allow for a consistent UI."

Allowing publishers to run the first couple of paragraphs then forcing you to their site to read the full article. Extending hyperlinks beyond the ad borders. Allowing articles that are totally product advertising.  Of course the app has to be make money. But when you start spamming on 3 articles in a row it becomes a waste of time."

I’m using the new scroll up version and now on top of having the ads within the stories a video add pops up at the top of the screen randomly and there is no way to get rid of it.

The only friends that can read my post must have Flipboard as well. It’s a hassle to view each article “on the web” first in order to share it on social media. There should be a better way to share directly from Flipboard so that everyone can read the article and you still receive credit for it in the first place.

Of course I’d like to not have any ads but maybe try incorporating them so that they look as part of the feed and not “off”.

Now it’s just a platform for ads to bombard you while you’re trying to read an article.  It’s so bad that the articles keep moving to make room for more ads to continually load.  Some articles you can’t read at all because you have to subscribe and can only read a few...ahem Wired.  If I have to subscribe then they shouldn’t be part of the feed.  I would rather sit through a 5 minute ad for some quality reading time with no ads.  I know you have to pay the bills but stop the attack already.

It’s interface hasn’t kept up with the much more modern iPhone version or website. In fact it’s years old compared to them. Yes there are minor updates, but nothing like the others.  I asked the developers well over a year ago about it and got a polite, generic response. Ask again, no progress. Finally gave up, deleted the app, and just use the website.

Otherwise they would let you know they fixed a specific annoying issue. It’s not hard to explain what changed. Until then, there is no motivation to upgrade and likely more of a motivation just to delete the app. And I’m getting tired of getting fed more articles that are remotely associated with what I’m interested in and just wasting time flagging them rather than reading anything useful."

178,Peekay1969,"July 31, 2019",4,Flipboard review This is a very good app in terms of pulling stories from across the Internet and placing them at your fingertips. The reason I don’t give this a higher rating is because the comments section is not adjudicated very well and there are a lot of trolls who often make inappropriate statements. Someone will inevitably blame Trump or Obama about something completely unrelated to the issue at hand and this intern sets off a cascade of comments which make the readership look like a community of trolls.
179,Dhdienxisosjsns,"June 15, 2019",4,"Miss the old Flipboard This is still my go to news app, but it often gets stale. It use to be that you could scroll forever and Flipboard would keep serving you brand new content or you could refresh the feed to get something new. Now the feed just adds a few new stories to the front and once you’ve flipped through them you’re stuck with the older stories you already read. There’s no ability to shuffle it up."
180,Savings Catcher fan,"October 27, 2017",4,Good app. Still tweaking my own experience I have used this app for a few years now on iPad and iPhone and enjoy it for the most part. I think I will enjoy it better as I tweak my preferences. 
181,Cornhole jury,"December 5, 2017",1,"Liberal bias These guys messed with my account after they didn't like a comment I made on an article.  Then they repeatedly gave me the run around when I contacted tech support.  I used civil language, but you know some people find disagreement as an attack.  Pretty ironic when journalists seek to censor the dissenting speech of others. "
182,Funjumpz,"January 16, 2018",5,"My favorite App I am not the kind of person who gives a crap about apps but I actually freaking love this app! What a great idea to have the ability to save articles to my own magazine. I depend on Flipboard for news and current events and new technologies. I would like to see more people using Flipboard with the ability to share my magazines with others, it would be awesome to have everyone using Flipboard!"
183,QuietCave,"February 8, 2018",4,"A fan looking for some flyover satisfaction A great way to expand your world view with Flipboard’s cleverly-curated content.

184,Lwps,"July 3, 2018",1,"Used to be a great app I don’t know why clipboard is changed, but I’ve just decided to delete it. What has finally pushed me over the edge is an article they published, supposedly went to Anthropologie, which is a screed about how recent discoveries by evolutionists have proven that the Bible is correct. I have been seeing more pseudo science stories here, where there only used to be really quality articles from good publications.I also don’t appreciate the way that ads are sometimes camouflage as stories. I don’t mind ads being in the app, they have to make money. But there needs to be a real clear delineation between what’s the real story and what isn’t. Period"
185,RCG801,"May 4, 2019",5,"Good my needs tweaks I like to read the news, but it would be nice to control what news sources comes into your category. I find myself having to flip past too many unwanted articles or have to open the article before realizing the source is questionable."
186,Ppietrus,"January 15, 2020",3,"Not a fan of the layout Flipboard used to show many article headings per page and it was easy to see what was going on, and pick the articles that were interesting quickly scrolling though news. Now it’s showing at most three headings, but often just two or even one, which requires constant swiping. "
187,Amalgam,"December 17, 2019",1,Lost its luster Each update to this app makes it less and less usable. It's to the point now that over half the articles open a blank page. When an article does open it often can't render properly and is riddled with so many ads that it takes forever to load. Used to be a great app for gathering/reading news. Unfortunately I'm going to abandon it.

Please read I’ve used flipboard for a long time and mostly enjoyed it until recently all of a sudden things that I had purchased on eBay and off of websites (and not common things, very specific motorcycle parts and stuff) started showing up in advertisements in the app. I’ve tried twice to reach out in the help section in the app and nobody will reply to me. I’m currently looking for a new app that collects news articles for me and I will be dumping this app due to their extremely unethical behavior"
189,bigorange,"August 18, 2019",1,Time wasting advertising redirects I’ve used this app for years. They advertise. Thats fine. It never caused any annoyance or additional effort on my part to just flip past an ad. Now in recent updates the app will push you out of Flipboard into the app store to tell you to download another app. This has happened 10-15 times to me over the past week. I’m not accidentally clicking on something. Its triggered by simply swiping to a blank ad-redirect page. So I have to close app store and go back to Flipboard to get to the next article. This is just blatant ignorance and annoyance in seeking ad dollars. Next time it happens I’m deleting Flipboard.
190,RockinJimmy,"November 1, 2017",5,"Very Fun The reason I love this app is that I never know what is coming next as I flip through the stories. I have multiple interests, so there is always something new to catch my interest as I flip through. If I was into only one or two topics, it might get boring, but I clicked on a lot of interests, so the cool articles flood in. If there is something I don't like, I skip it and keep going. It has become my go to app."

192,Wolfslain,"February 19, 2018",1,"Not For People Who Select Their Own Feeds The view for articles and news from the phone is very limited (3 articles at once) and the only way to change this is to add tons of magazines in which you have to thumb through. Even if you do make a page for each news source you want to see, you still only get the three stories per source. You can’t remove the “For You” tab that the app starts on which contained nothing of interest even after I setup my own selected news sources... user friendly if you trust the app to feed you info, not friendly at all for someone not interested in being spoon fed."

I tried Bored, taken I tried Very Board bored, taken I tried Extremely Bored, taken. Seems like there are a lot of bored readers out there. Let me try One of the millions of bored readers.

194,trumpout,"September 8, 2018",3,"Flipping I like the idea and concept of Flipboard, but so often the article comes from a place that it does not allow you to read the entire article, which defeats the purpose.

However, I’ve dislike every single thing that is Kardashian related, been doing it for months in fact. But I still see 1 or 2 articles a day in my main feed, the feed that supposedly fine tuned to my liking. It pretty clear either the dislike feature is broken and there to make you feel good... or the Kardashian’s are paying to always be in people feed which is BS, they are disgusting excuses for human beings that got famous from releasing a porn.

It’s not like I can quickly scroll to find my place again... today I was flipping and got to an ad. If I clicked on the ad, it took me out of the app... and lost my spot. If I x’d out of watching ad, then I lost my spot. I flipped back through and kept arriving st same ad 4x. I give up. I can’t use this."

I often end up going to a different article instead and then I cannot find my way back. Out of frustration, I often end up just exiting altogether and finding another traditional news app. Please Flipboard - develop an obvious navigation, not a cool navigation."

I hate that 🤬 I hope they go back to their normal approach of branding a flip as an ad in a more visible way. I’m really not into clicking thru your ads. Make it a paid app if that’s your approach!"

Why use an app that never fails to frustrate you?

220,Re8609,"September 30, 2017",2,Was good for awhile The continued changes have me looking for a replacement. The ads are increasing to a point it has become ridiculous. The links to paid news site make it impossible to read a bunch of articles. Site requiring memberships should not be included or you should have the ability to add these subscribed services if you have them. I miss the simple Google Reader.

However, I feel that the  way it opens the app store app without me clicking on an ad or asking my permission is an invasion of privacy. I don’t mind ads, but this feature is invasive and, as far as I can tell, an abuse of apple’s app store shortcut functionality. When I contacted support, my concern was promptly  acknowledged and brushed aside. In addition, its also just a nuisance to have to be forced to close my app store app over and over again. Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this feature is unacceptable."
227,st_mag,"December 12, 2018",2,Deceptive advertising After recent updates Flipboard has changed how ads look on the platform. Previously ads looked like ads. Now ads are many clickbate articles showing up in the middle of my news. It is difficult to tell the difference between what is coming from my news and what are ads. Not to mention the frequency makes it so that I always have to second guess if it’s an actual article or an ad.

It will be good to have an option to block articles from an author or source instead of the subject or publisher. Articles have so many adds that it is hard to read. It will be nice if the article presented in Flipboard is clean and readable instead of providing just links.

For example an article is selected that is concerned with global warming and gas pipelines.  I want to follow issues related to the pipelines but not climate change.  My filtering options to deselect topics doesn’t allow me to filter out climate change in this case.  Instead it will allow filtering out natural gas or energy as topics.

People are talking about it as though it's has an MS DOS interface or something.  Which leads me to my theory - the over-the-top haters are actually aggregate news portal competitors.  Just a theory!"

Such a great way to catch up on all my favorite sites and interests. It has a really nice interface that hasn't changed much over the years which shows how well it was originally designed. And any updates just make things better.
252,Louis Stephens,"April 10, 2018",5,"Great, but spam stories filtering in I have to say, in my previous review,  I rated it quite low due to spam slipping in my boards. However, the team behind Flipboard contacted me immediately and seem like they are really trying to help out. It's support like this that can really make an app shine. Hopefully, everything gets sorted out, but at least I know they are working on it."

There are other features I should be taking advantage of. Been using it many years."

If that’s what Flipboard is turning into then I’ll find my news and entertainment somewhere else. And this site is getting to be like Facebook more and more everyday with the ads. It is annoying when there’s an ad after every paragraph. Or a pop up that takes up so much room that it’s difficult to tell where the article is. I’ll be leaving this site soon.
257,Alans invitations,"April 1, 2020",5,Articles that should be ads I love FB and have referred many friends. One bother is the use of companies such as Washington Post to place articles with a subscription paywall offer to allow reading.

Sure you can still “report” invasive advertising tech from other sources but now Flipboard is selling adds from Google directly embedded in the app.  Now the platform is open to advertising from the highest bidders using SEO to push annoying junk products or junk agendas.  Nothing wrong with Flipboard making money but now, outside of looking great design, it’s no better than any other browser."

I've been using the app for many years and I don't want to start using AppleNews.

It’s brings up a wider variety of information than google does. Google’s news feed is too narrow. It’s way better and more effective than doing a ton of internet searches on your own or going to a few hundred sites. I’m a big fan, just make the desktop experience as good as the iPhone app."

And that’s when it actually completely reloads. Because often now it just reloads three times in five seconds and then just blanks out with a spinning wheel. "

So much doesn’t for my interests, or I am inundated with articles that are only remotely connected to my categories.  More importantly, the ads are so repetitive.  I’ve had to delete and reinstall after an ad for some random game popped up with this very annoying music.  I could not turn off the music.  Any time I reopened Flipboard, the music would start again, even if I was on another  page.  Not cool."

I have a slow pace job with lots of free time when there is no customers so i can easily spend 3-5 hours a day on this app, sometimes more if its super slow at work, and i would really love and enjoy the app a lot more if it had a complete dark mode, it would look amazing with the iphone x oled display! Please add a dark mode!😭🙏🏼🙏🏼"

There are always lots of different ideas to choose from and I enjoy reading what I have read. Since I have a wide range of interests I find Flipboard offers many opportunities to explore what attracts me!
334,Hrinvero,"February 20, 2019",1,Overloaded with ad’s and annoyances This app. Is totally and overwhelmingly loaded with ads. They are in your face on top of what you’re trying to read sliding all across the screen and interrupting anything worthwhile that this app tries to offer. If you’re looking for a way to annoy intimidate and aggravate your readers this app is the poster child for how to do it. I would have given a 1/2 star if that option was available so all that I can say is stay as far away from this application as you can unless you’re a masochist and enjoy being terrorized by Papa up ads.
335,Res5r,"February 16, 2020",2,"Nice but frustrating Lately, a couple times a week I get some pages that come up with an error that the page didn’t load correctly. The options that come up still won’t load the page correctly. Restarting the app doesn’t fix the problem. The only thing that helps is to restart the tablet itself then it will work fine for a few more days until this starts up again. App and tablet are fully updated."

On my iPhone 6 running iOS 12 (the last version available for it) the app runs fine. On my iPhone 6S with the latest iOS and the latest app version it now runs fine after experiencing crashing like on my iPhone 7.
337,Pr1ncess17,"December 19, 2019",4,"Love it, except... Flipboard is my most often used app. I flip while waiting for appointments, and I flip every night before bed. My only complaint is that the articles run out far sooner than I’d like.. then I would have to switch to a different app. I see no need for this as there are innumerable articles online.. and i’m sure they can find more that relates to my topics?"

Also several of the stories you’re not able to read unless you subscribe to the media company that has posted the article.  App has lost its purpose and ease of use.
341,jerry stover,"March 20, 2019",5,"Great magazine I love this magazine. Great articles about every interest I have and don’t have.

I can feel the back of my iPhone is more than warm even through the silicon case.  It was impossible to use on my iPhone 6 since the battery life was getting weak.  I like the app, but I don’t like to feel the super hot heat on my brand new iPhone, even it’s got great battery, while using this app. So I usually switch to other app for news."
343,RG-Newsreader,"March 31, 2019",2,"Great app, but with more and more adds and pop ups Have been using this app for years as my go to news aggregator. In the past few weeks I see I’m having to flip through the same annoying ads for winter vacations ( it is now spring ) and some miracle puréed banana that will make you super healthy. Although the app gives you the ability to  request “less like this” these same ads keep coming up over and over. Considering looking for a new one, to be honest."
344,Aplasticjones,"May 7, 2019",1,"A great app gone wrong. I used proclaim how much enjoyed Flipboard from the mountain tops when I first got it. Now I am totally tired of it.

345,uncmb,"February 8, 2020",5,"Numbers 1!!! In my opinion, Flipboard is the news app that I visit several times a day. It allows flexibility to choose from a long list of topics like several news allow, Yet Flipboard's setup is the difference maker. From the images to the ability of stacking up articles to ease surfing."
346,Huge4,"February 2, 2020",1,"Constant barrage of pay site bait-and-switch I give Flipboard one star for the same reason I uninstalled Apple News. I don’t use news aggregators so I can be barraged with bush-league attempts to coerce me into subscribing to pay sites. You will constantly see articles in your feed that you’ll want to read (because they’re a topic you follow) only to click through and be told you must buy a subscription. There is no way to turn these stories off beyond a reasonable settings search, so if it exists, it’s intentionally buried. Nice work Flipboard. Viva Consumer!"

348,Rebel31,"January 7, 2020",2,"January 2019 update This app has been my source of news for the longest, allowing me to follow multiple news and entertainment sources, and while I understand ads allows the app to be free, with the most recent updates when you try to swipe and ad to keep going to the next article, it detects the swipe as a “tap” and it lunches Safari to open the ad. This is unacceptable and unless they fix this issue I’ll stop using the app and won’t recommend it to anyone."
349,EddieConcurIsBad,"August 3, 2019",2,"System and Battery Hog Flipboard has great magazines and content, but you better have your iPhone plugged in when using it.  It is a system and battery hog!  I can literally watch my battery level go down and down when I use it.  They need to do something about this because I find myself using it less and less because of the drain on my iPhone.  I guess they’re putting a whole bunch of crap on my iPhone and getting as much info about me as they can."

351,Jim618034,"January 2, 2018",5,"Still the best. I think of this app as one of the very first to make me understand the power of applications. It's ability to draw together many different sources into a coherent, easy-to-read and visually interesting format was a first. Others have come since then but Flipboard has stayed very much at the forefront."
352,Bdytdfy,"December 30, 2018",2,"Saturated by ads I used to love Flipboard. It was my only real source of any news. Lately it has become incredibly saturated by ads. At least 10%, if not more, of the pages I flip through our ads. Some ads open while trying to flip past them (kind of a sleazy tactic). Other ads are “sponsored” and look identical to normal articles until they pop you out of the app into a new window. Very unenjoyable experience. I’ll be looking for a new news app now."
353,easyjay39402,"January 27, 2019",3,"Used to be good ... but now Flipboard features way too many news stories that I can’t actually read. The feature stores are from publishers like the New York Times and the Washington Post, which require you to purchase a subscription in order to actually view the content. I haven’t found a way to turn off stories from such sources in the app, so they continue to dominate my news feed."
354,iamaguynamededdy,"March 6, 2019",2,"This app has so much potential but.... The developers need to figure out how to filter out the articles that don't belong in a magazine. For example, I subscribed to the Ohotography magazine and I get articles on celebrities, politics, and way too much stuff that has nothing to do with the my topic of interest."

Still a lot of resources & useful information you can get to…but only if you participate in a full page survey that pops up & you can’t move on to the article till you complete a stupid survey. Yes this happened a couple of times most recently about 10 minutes ago. As if they don’t collect enough information about everyone, now it’s masqueraded as a survey. How low have you gone."
363,Kiyytgh,"December 21, 2018",2,Ads and can't delete annoying I used to love flipboard but now everything is just ads and more ads and clicking so you can get to even more ads. It just irritates me and provides little of substance. My use is way down and I may totally delete it.

Lately though, these ads basically hijack your phone. Some crazy loud music playing, redirects to App Store and opens a safari window. Like all at once. If you go to the hole screen, and open Flipboard again the music is still playing in the background. You have to force close flipboard to make the music stop. Ridiculous how they played it. Would of rather paid for a subscription. *Delete"
366,Jman5105,"February 23, 2020",3,Limited access to articles Over time it has become more restrictive as to what articles you can read from Flipboard.   It seems like every month their are more restrictions put on what you can read and what you can not.  It’s a great aggregator of news but very frustrating that you have to pay for subscription to each source of data.   I would rather pay for flipboard.

373,Drod0679,"January 3, 2018",5,Illuminati Every time I open my Flipboard email - I find intriguing stories rarely covered by mainstream sources. Presented in short reads that leave me informed. The stories are well written with the sense that we don’t have a great deal of time and the short reads hit the target with succinct accuracy. I have not yet been disappointed.
374,Kurushii Drive,"January 4, 2018",5,"Wonderful App One of the best news apps around. The interface is appealing to the eye, user-friendly, and easy to navigate.

375,BellaUccella,"January 15, 2019",5,Love. One request I’ve used this for a many years and it keeps improving. It would be great if you could see articles from various sources addressing a single headline. There are some articles for which this is provided already. But I would love to see this expanded. Perhaps just a dedicated magazine for this?
376,E.Siekman,"November 4, 2019",4,"Question, not review Is there a way to prevent Flipboard from auto-updating/refreshing when I open from the background?  There are times when I am reading an article, need to do something else and then come back to the article.  Problem is, when I open from background, it refreshes and I lose my article.  Thank you."

Unfortunately, it is now so full of Ads between articles that it’s hard to enjoy the greatness of the unique app. Granted, it’s free and ads are important but I am now constantly just avoiding the app and merely just read the summary below the headlines. I am now downloading all the individual news apps, an annoying way around this ad business, so I can get my morning news. Flipboard Developers, please reconsider ad placement and frequency."

Reading about people’s struggles to success inspires me & gives me hope. I recommend this app to everyone!!!"
379,GymmeV,"April 9, 2020",3,"Needs additional display & font controls Aside from the fact that some articles are baseless and untrue dependent on subject, it would be nice to control the font size and have a darker contrast option (i.e. dark mode).

381,kingjz1234567,"November 26, 2017",5,Flipboard is the best You might be thinking this is bad review about flipboard but its not the things I love about flipboard is that they tell you news that nobody knows about and they give you catogores and one of the best things about flipboard is that you can create your own magazine thank you for making flipboard
382,Smssulu,"December 22, 2017",5,A perfect digest of news worthy articles. I have been following Flipboard for about five years.

However, it is getting more difficult as so many magazines/newspapers are charging to read an article.

There are a thousand pop up advertisements that prevent you from reading the article. Many of times it will redirect you to another website with no way of getting back to the article. This app can really be great if they would get rid of all the clutter and redirecting advertisements within the article. But as it stands, this app is very needy."

But as a conservative, MY GOSH this is a seriously liberally-biased app. The political is ALWAYS about how Trump is about to ruin the world, everything he is is terrible, and humanity will end because of him. I just want my news source to be unbiased and show both sides of the aisle, but my friends and I now get together and take bets on the severity of the news against Trump and have made some pretty funny games out of it. Just another biased media source. Which is sad because the app itself is otherwise flawless."
406,Steedes,"April 12, 2020",1,"Feeds on hate for advertising revenue Flipboard claims ethics but when you report a comment that has hate or swears, they only block it from your view. Those people are still spewing hate and commenting their pure hate and anger without any interaction of Flipboards staff.  Either do something completely or don’t. You have created an environment where lies and threats are ok and encouraged versus removing these people completely. Maybe you need real leadership and integrity. Are this point it is evident you only care about advertising dollars."

Just read the comments left by visitors of this site to understand the depth in ignorance of its users. Remember that when corporations own the state, corporate media becomes state propaganda.

At this point the app is crap and will be deleted. The improvements your team attempts to make are making your app very slow and content does not relate to favorites I have selected. And the password option is a freakin’ joke. So no more, and I don’t wish to see anyone else going through this frustrating exercise each day."

I would even pay and upgrade to remove the ads (I really do like the app). Also, while they do notate which are ads, it is very discrete and not immediately obvious."
497,Resistance Reader,"March 7, 2020",5,"Great Sourcefor Up-to-Date News This is a great place to get news from a variety of news sources. I wish they would offer a subscription service so that you could pay one fee and get access to the Washington Post, New York Times, etc."
498,KatWalk65,"January 13, 2020",5,"The aesthetics and ease of use I keep Flipboard because it tends catch my eye more than other options. Big plus: now that I can access subscriptions to wash Post, Atlantic, LA Times, New Yorker then curate in a central platform where I manage my magazines. It's a great approach for creators who research and gather visual data."
499,Twillerup,"December 26, 2019",1,"What the heck is up with the messed up UI? I don’t know what has happened Flipboard. I used to love you but you no longer deliver the quality you used too.  What is up with the missing flip?  At random times you suddenly go into some kind of funk.  The pages won’t flip, and the stupid horizontal scrolling you force me into is an exercise in frustration .  And the pages thst do flip are full of crap I don’t want to see, and not even very much of that.  Sorry Flipboard, the love affair is over."

522,Dixe2008,"December 3, 2019",1,"Politicized app I use Flipboard to check news, but consider app mostly gossip app due to largely heavily politicized left leaning content and lack of verifiable information on the app. The app appears to give very biased one sided opinion, even in technology, and its content is largely owned by 2 newspapers, Washington Post and New York Times. I often read app for 5-10 min a day simply because it is on my phone. Realistically as soon as I delete it, which will happen this year, I will probably never remember it again."
523,Rrchrd,"September 30, 2019",1,"They asked for a review so here it is There isn’t anything better but the best out of bad options is still bad. The number of ads launches this as the most annoying news reader available. It has the best UI, except for the forced section that it curated for you and forces you to see.

It usually happens with leftist leaning news companies that just never get muted. Either it works or it doesn’t. Someone like me may think your company is pushing an agenda. Maybe you should think about what business your in.

PLEASE fix this!
544,Gwags76,"October 3, 2018",2,"FakeNewsBoard I just deleted the app. Got tired of parsing all the Soviet style propaganda. Nearly every article is from a known propaganda site- CNN, Washington Post, MSNBC, etc.  In an age when the internet allows you to go right to the source for your news it’s silly and wasteful to subject yourself to an aggregation of slanted fake news. I like to read news from all sides of the spectrum, if Flipboard learns how to mix it up a little maybe I’d give it another go."

I’ve complained about some of the changes over the years but the amount of trolls and racist/offensive comments are a real problem. I wrote Flipboard customer service about it but they don’t care and say to report each comment which I’ve done but it’s never ending. I think I’ll be using Apple News or an alternative from now on. What a disappointment.

586,Classic guitar man,"March 29, 2020",3,Shakes while scrolling now So reading stories on an iPad Pro and scrolling now results in screen shakes that makes it impossible to read text without getting “seasick” after a few minutes.  It never used to do this but now it does. If you like your news with a touch of Parkinson’s thrown in for good measure this app is for you!

I get it, you have to make money, but the ads are completely out of control. It seemed like every other “article” was an ad and now there are floating ads! They stay on your screen until you close it out. It’s too much guys. Maybe I’ll come back if this changes."

590,PVMasterChief,"October 27, 2017",4,Awesome app that's a bit iOS 11 glitchy Been using Flipboard for years. It's my favorite new and visual media aggregator. I'm having the same problem as Silva Hawk in September 25. The animation is glitchy while flipping pages. It's so distracting and using that I've avoided the app for a bit now hoping for a bug-fixing update.

Overall I like this app. BUT lately it has been pulling articles that are WAY out of date - announcing the launch of cars that have out for years, Cybersecurity breaches that happened years ago.

599,rus5,"December 23, 2019",2,Article Quality is Very Poor I like the idea here but the quality of articles is usually poor and often extremely poor.  Especially the science related ones.

606,petenbama,"July 7, 2018",1,Too many fluff articles I am so tired of those fake staged stock pics that accompany every article. The fast flipping is a neat feature but other than that there’s nothing better vs simpler news apps that don’t rely on gimmicks and silly hot air articles. This is also a data hog. The final straw for me.....today’s first article in Health category is titled “The Manscaping Guide to Healthy and Well Groomed PUBIC Hair.”  And of course the article’s stock photo is a male model with long green leaves growing outside his underwear. Bye and good riddance.

Often the tiles will go unresponsive, requiring many tab switches to ""reactivate"". The ""less like this"" by subject still seem to have very little effect unless you mute things by site, which isn't always feasible. To top it all off, channels would randomly have no content at all.

I actually prefer to get both right and left wing news so I can try to piece together what is actually going on, but not with this app. Everything it fed me for news was extreme left-wing and really not discussing current events aside from picking apart tweets. A simple web search will show you there is more going on in the world than that. I was information, not indoctrination."
633,Raghead34,"November 6, 2017",1,Dictator like administration of comments If anyone complains about a comment you’ve made whether you broke one of their vague rules or they just disagree with your politics they will ban you from commenting permanently.

650,Eustace88,"October 3, 2018",3,New ad pop ups force you to open The way ad pop ups happen now is a split second on whole screen so when you swipe you “have” to click it and the ad opens.

It’s a trick to get ad clicks which I don’t like.  Furthermore, I’m not sure why they would want their users to exit Flipboard for any reason. Anyway, got annoyed, deleted the app, and will look for alternatives."

Since when should my For You section include articles on dogs hash tagged as Guinea pigs?!???! The app has stopped making sense and no matter how many times I go through the ""show less"" game, my For You is flooded with random articles that are useless. It's a shame. I've loved this app for years but now it's just not relevant or useful. I guess I'll be returning to Apple news. Sad."

There seems to be no way to turn it off or block these stories that are completely unrelated to all my interests. Very annoyed
819,Ridious W.,"October 2, 2019",2,Disappointed now I loved Flipboard until recently because it now has ads that as soon as I swipe up to read the next story it pops up a webpage then forces me to go to the App Store.

It is not worth the hassle."

This app is not worth to keep."
848,Yodawhistle,"January 16, 2019",3,Can Inprove but good APP Been using this from almost the beginning. Has great possibilities..

859,BrizzyB,"October 9, 2019",1,Used to enjoy this app but now the ads are overwhelming. Every update adds more and more intrusive advertising. This latest one is so jarring with the flashing ads that I can’t concentrate on the article I’m trying to read. There are now even large ads that cover the material your tying to read.

1909,culfool,"December 5, 2019",3,Don’t like the new Flipboard Because it’s no longer a flipboard. It’s a scrollboard like all the rest. I liked the old interface that flipped the stories like a book.

1919,jeffdukedotcom,"June 24, 2019",1,What happened? Insane credit card offering! App was amazing. Then it sold out to scumbags. Thanks for all the bullish!y adds and terrible “picked for you content”. What the hell happened?

It's an awesome idea for getting all your news and feeds in a magazine format. It's definitely something that people should try out (especially since it's free). 
3281,Hurricane1376,"February 1, 2012",4,"nice beginning This is a hard app to review because honestly it's just a simplified web browser. What you subscribe to is no different than what you get at their respective website.  The ""faux ezine"" look is just that; I have subscribed feeds that just list articles.  And I wouldn't be surprised if you can make Firefox or Chrome look the say way."

3290,Trixed,"December 16, 2012",5,"Crashes Regularly; buggy, not listening There are many features of Flipboard I enjoy, such as the diverse content selection and the flip feature. Even with its faults, i use it almost daily. However, it crashes regularly, sometimes multiple times. Very annoying. According to others, I am not the only one experiencing crashing. Also, it is hard to successfully expand to read the article beyond the teaser. It often moves to the prior or subsequent article and sometimes that next piece is not the full piece. Also it is so laden with other junk that it is hard to read and hard to touch it to expand it without triggering a link to something else. Despite multiple complaints i see of these problems and other aberrant behavior, the developer is unwilling or unable to fix this potentially fine app. Without the crash and other issues, which occur almost every time I use it, this would be a 5 star app. Great content is comparatively useless without decent function. Today it carashed 3 times in about 30 minutes. Once, a pop-up acknowledged that Flipboard quit unexpectedly (this is the first time i have received this popup) and invited me to send an anonymous report (which I did), but not the other two times."
3291,Nutella Bear,"March 10, 2013",3,"Nice Reader But Ads Becoming Obnoxious I use this app a lot, but noticed that recently I am getting many more ads and it is becoming obnoxious. Hard to quantify because I never counted the ads before, but I seem to remember seeing one or two when I'd use the app previously. Now, I am getting a full page ad every other article that I read and that is too much. They are inserted after the first page of an article and take up the whole screen. The ads are interactive as well, and one wrong touch and you are off to a full web site for whatever product is being advertised."
3292,Imdasoupman,"April 3, 2013",3,"Cool idea but needs help First thing, I like the premiss of the app.  Being able to take all the stuff I look at daily and put it in one app is a great idea.  When I set it up, I turned off the app's ability to post on my behalf on Facebook.  I've been trying to change it back but it says my device settings need to be changed.  I can not find the settings to change them.  It doesn't show up under my device settings so I guess I am stuck.  Second, I don't like that I can't put the news that I want on it.  I am stuck with the news that is completely biased.  I would like to be able to put different news providers on it so I can get both sides of the story.  I can't put news from specific sports teams on it.  Personally, I am an Ohio sports fan.  I want to be able to see team updates for my teams, not all the sports teams in each sport.  For some reason, the media seems to think everyone cares about the Yankees and Red Sox.  Well, I don't care about them at all.  Therefor, I would like to be able to add specific teams instead of what the sports media thinks I like.  I also would like to be able to add all my feeds on Facebook.  E.g. Close friends, family, etc instead of only my news feed.  Like I said, it's a cool app that could be a lot cooler if these things were addressed.  I hope it gets better."
3293,Magneticnorth124789,"July 14, 2015",2,"1 of my fav apps but dysfunctionally buggy Flipboard is like Pinterest for content. By subscribing to users' magazines I get news, blogs, magazines about topics I'm interested in and I don't have to do the work of drilling down. There is so much going on in the world that major media doesn't cover. Knowing its out there in the net doesn't make it easy to find, but flipboard has done it. I can browse for hours about travel and hiking and never be subjected to low quality content, irrelevant content, or intrusive ads or web page designs. One problem. The programming end of this app is dismal. They have a bunch of first graders running their software development. Example: a magazine has 500 articles in it, but you'll only be able to flip to 30 of them. They've  never heard of evergreen content. Magazines will mysteriously reorder their articles, and the flip it marklet can't see the difference between a banner, add, video, head shot, or cover photo - resulting in icons appearing as cover photos. That is if the marklet can find any image, which it often does not while there are perfectly good images right there in the article where the author put them. Both the iOS app and desktop version are fritzy and ready to fail at any given moment. The app crashes often. Too bad they couldn't hire real developers, this app would be one of the best all time apps if not for its continuing choking up."
3294,Wilcoghost,"October 27, 2015",5,"Best News App Flipboard acquired Zite a year or so ago, in case you didn't know. And while I used to prefer Zite, Flipboard has now surpassed Zite in every way. You can get MUCH more granular in your topics of interest now, and you can also up and down vote stories much like you could in Zite. You can also create ""magazines"" and flip stories into them, for later reading (not offline though), or to easily share with anyone who follows you. The only thing it's missing from Zite is the ability to directly add stories to Safari's reading list. At times I make PDF archives of stories of particular interest to me, and I could easily put those stories into my Safari reading list to make the PDFs on my computer sometime in the future. With Flipboard I have to chose ""open in Safari,"" then use Safari to add to reading list. It's an extra step, and an annoyance that's likely particular to me, and not likely to be rectified. But outside of that small annoyance, Flipboard is visually stunning to the point of out ""Apple-ing"" Apple's me-too news app visually. And it's content and ability to retrieve topics of your interest is superior to Apples news app as well. As far as Zite, I loved it back when. But it's acquirers have rendered it outdated. It was great back when though..."
3295,Bowmanguy,"December 15, 2015",1,"Very disappointed former site user Years ago when I first got an ipad, I tried Flipboard after reading a rave review somewhere.  I thought it was sort of cool, but I found it kind of clumsy to use on a regular basis, and did not find myself particularly compelled by the content.  It struck me as a case of cool design trumping functionality and content.  A while later I discovered Zite, and very quickly found myself using it on a daily basis.  It was definitely a case of form following function, and content being king.  It was simple and intuitive to use, easy to 'train' about the stories I preferred, the range of topics was very broad, and I was delighted by the fact that it frequently found items from great sources I had no idea existed.   I have to say that I feel it improved my life.  When I heard that Zite was being bought by Flipboard, I was hugely disappointed, but at least a little encouraged that it sounded like the best ideas from Zite would be used to improve Flipboard.  Now that the transition has occurred, it seems like none of that has been done.  I don't really see anything much changed in Flipboard, it still feels like an uninviting chore to use, and the content remains uninspired relative to what I found in Zite."
3296,Roni lynn,"December 27, 2015",5,"Wow! REALLY good! I've had this app for a long time now, but I rarely used it. I missed Zite so I resisted using Flipboard and didn't take the time to check out all of the features. I would check it every couple of weeks if I was bored. The app I use the most is Twitter because I'm a news and current events nerd and I have this insatiable need to devour all sorts of info. Well, I don't know when Flipboard became this most awesome news aggregator ever, but it is. ANY subject that you want to read about, you will find here. You WILL have to work to cultivate your likes and dislikes but Flipboard's algorithm does a good job of responding.  YOU create your own ""magazines"" to collect the news YOU want to read. And others can follow your magazine if you want them to. "
3297,Woody427,"March 10, 2016",5,"Everything I need in one place When set up correctly, and upon install you choose ALL of your interests, even those you're only somewhat interested in, Flipboard will grab stories from every magazine, both online and in print and present them to you in an easy to read format. You can also connect your social media accounts to Flipboard to create your own magazines showing your Facebook news feed, the latest tweets from those you follow on Twitter, in a "" flip the page"" format that keeps the format and style of Flipboard wile presenting to you the latest in your social media circle. There are many magazines to choose from at your fingertips that are there based upon the interests you chose when you set up Flipboard. For instance, maybe you chose music? Well, there's Rolling Stone magazine with the latest articles from both the print version, but also the latest online stories of the day. Sports? Well, there's Sports Illustrated and ESPN. The choices are vast, and the few bad reviews I've seen here can be fixed by choosing more interests, which will give you a much larger selection of articles and magazines to choose from."
3298,Dhwvdisbe,"February 16, 2017",3,"Not a good revamp After LinkedIn bought pulse I discovered Flipboard and never looked back. Until this latest update. Being a person that has some background in app development I am trying to figure out how the newest update was able to make it completely through the testing/evaluation and approval process with some really bad shortcomings. Commenting was improved with nested reply to comments, but the notifications informing you of comments is abysmal. When you bring up the comment thread you have no way of knowing what article you commented on because that article does not pop-up with the comment thread. Coping a comment you published was axed which makes quoting someone very time consuming because you have to transcribe what they wrote. The article previews before you click on  them improved but also didn't at the same time. Now some of the article previews feature moving videos, which is cool but loose luster once your data is consumed at a faster rate than ever. They need to make a setting where you can turn that on or off. "
3299,Aviator&Nurse,"March 1, 2017",5,"New UI puts content on back burner Flipboard is a daily digest for me.  I have curated several magazines that are mostly for my own consumption, but have also attracted others as well.  I loved the ease of use in magazine ""flips"" and the prominent spot my content had in the previous UI."
3300,Bluedepth,"November 3, 2011",5,"Top Notch App, Outstanding Support I've been using Flipboard since it was first announced on my first generation iPad. The device has been updated to the latest iOS 5 and I recently had a problem with the app ""jettisoning"" very frequently. I contacted Flipboard support, and the reached me via Twitter and Email. They were calm (much calmer than I was, truth to be told) and asked for logs and how to get at them and then responded with an update that they had fixed a slate of bugs and had submitted an update to the Apple App Store. They were true to their word and they fixed the issues I was having and I'm back to where I was originally, absolutely loving this app. If you are on the fence about whether or not to purchase this app, do it. You will really love it. It's worth every red cent. In fact it's the only way I can stand to browse Facebook or Google Reader anymore, so think on that when you are trying to decide whether to buy or not. The support is the cherry on top, but it's nice to know they care enough about the product to invest such time and attention on it and us users. That's not frequently the case with a lot of App Store developers."
3301,DekeJediVader,"December 8, 2011",5,"Glad I stuck with it I had a lot of trouble initially getting this puppy to recognize my wi-fi connection. But once it did, wow!  Sleek and intuitive, I've spent the last hour browsing through it and am thoroughly impressed. As a matter of fact once you start browsing you really can't put it down. A whole lot of news apps are about to be banished from my iPhone 4S simply because of redundancy. "
3302,Scott..?,"February 17, 2013",4,"A massive aesthetic upgrade So it's pretty cool, puts most of my social media feeds into one, magazinesque format. This is rad, saves me time keeping up on my feeds, searching for news, etc.  However, for some reason, it does not integrate correctly with my Facebook page; it reads the info, but does not let me ""like"" or comment on anything (the option is there, it just has not worked a single time in my experience). Considering one of my motivations in getting this app was to avoid the aesthetic atrocity that is Facebook, while still engaging in the forum, I'd say it's a pretty major drawback.  That said, clearly the app has been designed with this functionality in mind, so I am only docking 1 star, because in general this app is rad, and I believe will continue to become more awesome as more and more sights and feeds start tailoring their data output with this kind of aggregate formatting in mind (Pinterest account direct link, please). With the eminent disappearance of igoogle, I am stoked to have found this app, and I hope they tighten up the loose bolts soon."
3303,Lauren2213,"January 22, 2014",2,"Horrible as an rss reader, good for random categorized articles I don't understand the hype about this app anymore.  It was AMAZING when it synced with Google Reader. Using Reader, I could easily follow any blog, flickr account, etc, and on my iPhone I could flip through them. The layout design of this is brilliant: minimal yet effective. "
3304,ucmj22,"November 2, 2014",3,"New version, new review Not happy with the newest update. I like many of the improvements, but my main topic page has regressed to a scrolling interface. While I can understand how this can be beneficial to users with an unwieldy amount of tiles, it just disengages me. I have found myself scrolling past the topics I am looking for and have to go back and search them out. It was the paging that made flipboard unique to me. In a world of scrolling it brought an almost tactile environment of page turning. Why reel back that feature in the main topic page? Another problem I am having with this update is that the face tiles are updating far less often than before. I am opening the app only to see the same tile faces I saw 2 days ago which leaves me uninterested. I have spent much less time in this app over the last few days than I normally would and I honestly see my interest waning."
3305,Politics major,"January 5, 2015",1,"Biased, skewed, and the opposite of what I expected. I use both flip board and stumbled upon for this type of article and source finding. Between stumbled upon and flip board, choose stumbled upon. As a student of politics I use these apps to find articles about current policy debates and to track political philosophy. I expect to receive sources from both sides and see the conservative, the liberal, the republican, and the democrat perspectives on things. All it gives you is left-wing side articles from poor and illegitimate sources. I was hoping for things from the daily mail or the guardian US but that is sadly not the case. Poorly written and strongly biased articles are what you can expect from flip board. Aside from the skewed political information it provides, when you choose an interest, for example religion, it doesn't give you articles or essays about religions and about different faiths, but rather articles written that are against religion. All that ever came up in the religion section was pro-atheism articles and that's not what I was looking for. I, and I'm assuming other users, chose religion as an INTEREST because we were genuinely interested in religion and different religions, not atheism. It seems that whatever the interest is that you're following it gives you the opposite of what you want. Don't bother downloading flip board, unless they change their ways."
3306,Fnu1,"December 8, 2015",1,"Clunky and inferior Because Zite was closed, I was forced into Flipboard.  I was content with Zite.  It asked what my interests were and, quite plainly, tried to adapt to them, adjusting as I would make comments about an article."
3307,Michael Jon Axl,"April 8, 2016",5,"Information Giant Flibboard remains for me the best and only place to get information in style. It's sleek page flip transition pulled me in to the app at first. I stayed for the contend. It's user driven content first approach pushes the user to inform themselves and pass on the information to another through personally curated magazines. I enjoy the apps layout because it doesn't push you to automatically feel the need to like or comment on everything. You don't even have to share your magazines or profile. You can be as social or as private as you want and still enjoy this app. It's integration into your browser of choice is a great way to save all those things on the web you want to look at again, but never do because it gets hidden in your bookmark. The stylish way your articles came to life with gifs, videos and photos makes you look like a professional editor. You can even add you other social networks into flibboard and display it all in a stylish magazine which makes it easier and fun to read."
3308,Robér,"August 4, 2016",2,"Are developers stuck in a box? So many apps lock you into page margins and empty space. You can't zoom in to take a closer look, or zoom in to fill the screen. You can't zoom in to see text better; you can't zoom into the page layout just a bit to see a section a little more up close. Nope, you become locked into the ""wide shot"" page layout, no ""close ups"". Yes, you can click on a photo and it will take you to the photo view with slight zoom capabilities. That is good. But how about keeping the article view and let us zoom into it, as is, for a closer look. Remember when the future showed us Pinch & Zoom? "
3309,Still Hoping,"May 10, 2017",5,"Truly great news and information aggregator! This is my favorite app on my iPad. I set it up for news on all topics and information/news on specific topics that are of particular interest to me. I literally learn something new everyday! Also the ability to create and curate your own ""magazines"" of articles and news you can archive is invaluable to me. Also you can read or follow other people's magazines on topics of interest to you and you can share yours as well. Ad's are not too intrusive that they distract you all of the time. A few feeds are from sources that wan't you to buy a paid subscription but you can usually find the same information from some other source. The app is very stable and supports most video and audio feeds as they come up. If you are curious by nature, want to keep learning, be more informed or want to be up to date on current events or topics of interest to you get this app!"
3310,Teiji,"January 12, 2011",5,"Fast, smooth, beautiful, and professional feeds reader!!! This app is awesome!!! I love the way it presents the feeds (even Facebook and Twitter) in a magazine-style format (very pretty and professional), which makes it much more enjoyable to scan and read content. Not only that, but it also auto-loads the web version of the feeds, and you can just gesture your finger up to see the web version. When changing the orientation, it rearranges the feeds while still keeping its beautiful layout. Also, the font size is perfect, so you don't need to zoom in (unless you're reading the web version of course). Also, the built-in FlipFeeds are great ways to gather ""all"" the feeds from several sources, which differentiates and makes this app better than many other feeds-reader apps. And lastly, it can get feeds from days ago, unlike Pulse News, which can get the latest 25 (?)."
3311,TraciBaker,"November 29, 2012",5,"Wow. I just wrote a review on Newsify the other day and swore I'd never use another news app... But I was wrong. Very, very wrong. I've been resisting Flipboard because I knew it had social networking integration and I loathe social networking; I thought social networking accounts were a must have to use Flipboard. My mistake. It is such a beautiful app. A must have for anyone who really loves news and the experience of reading it. In other news apps, I found myself just scrolling instead of actually reading the articles."
3312,Pretroika,"February 1, 2013",2,"Good but not that good This is a gorgeous app and I love the original idea of it but the experience of using it's more like you want it to be a hard working app but in reality it is not .... I'm pretty sure the developers have put their part , but the thing is that not all websites are good to open with this app ; must of the stuff that you are willing to read it won't let you read it right then and there and that's when the problem comes because it takes forever to load and sometimes it just won't do it . Some videos don't play ."
3313,Ericismyname,"August 19, 2013",4,"Great app but disappointed To be fair Flipboard has been and still is the primary source of my phone and Internet time. It truly is the best news app in my opinion. The reason for this review however is because I am displeased with the Top Stories feature since the last update. The best part about flipping through stories was that you could see the headline along with a picture for every story. Now the first few pages are simply text which I have to scan and completely read to get the idea and decide whether I want to read further or flip past. This may seem like a small complaint but I just can't get over how the experience is no longer one of effortless decision making. I mean its not impossible to use or anything, but just less enjoyable for the first few pages, which btw are the top stories (which are probably ones I would strongly consider reading). I say keep the GIF implementation and go back to the full screen headlines with graphics instead of the list. Please:)"
3314,Diner fan,"October 27, 2013",3,"Nice, but could use some improvement The google+ part of the app is slightly annoying because it does not let you see the comments of your friends, instead it shows you the comments from the original poster (who is someone I don't know). Also, the app does not let you see the full picture until you tap the screen. Then afterwards, you have to tap it back to re-flip it. Having to flip is slightly annoying too since I am someone who enjoys scrolling more. But that's just a personal preference. I can't seem to add anyone to my circle or as my friend in either Facebook or Google+. The Cover Stories part of the app. It is good since it gives you some major news, but I would like to have things separate. If you had the option to remove that part, then that may solve the problem. I understand that this is supposed to me a newspaper, but maybe you could see the way that the apps for the actual Google+ or tumblr app is formatted and try to copy it? Overall, it is a pretty convenient app. Just wish there were more ways to personalize it for yourself."
3315,droFydoC,"February 23, 2014",5,"Get it get it get it This app is sooo good! One of the best news apps out there. They take articles from different popular websites. Everything is organized, there's  celebrity news, world news, video game news, sports news, film/cinema news, technology news, music news, fashion/art etc... You can also link up your twitter, facebook, and tumblr. I'm addicted to this app. There's so much news articles on many subjects, you can spend the whole day just reading, and you genuinely feel a bit smarter, caught up, and even in-the-know before things become in-the-know."

3317,Schlugmo,"December 8, 2015",1,"Could have learn from Zite. I will find a new app for this purpose.  Zite made some sense.  There was organization, clarity, a logic to the way information was presented.  I've really tried with Flipboard a couple of times, yet it just seems to be presenting a rigid, linear and LIMITING interface that defies all logic.  WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?  If I wanted to be limited, manipulated, or awed by special effects, I'd still be using the oppressive AOL start page, or I'd see what Fox News wants me to think.  This app gives me the feeling I just hit the ""I Feel Lucky"" Goober button, as to get a list of results with no order, no context, just a random list of stuff with no particular significance.  I am very disappointed that Zite is gone.  I enjoyed using that app regularly.  I don't enjoy using Flipboard.  I don't think it's logical, organized or helpful.  Those are really the only things that I'd want from this app.  Zite was all of those things.  THIS app is not.  Thank you for developing this app, but please consider at least making it more like the original so many of us enjoyed.  The algorithm seems to have improved, but everything else is poorly executed in my opinion.  This app is no match, let alone replacement, for Zite."
3318,thebirdman7,"October 13, 2016",4,"Nice app but lack of font control is disappointing I am disappointed. I paid for this app along time ago but you show me ads all the time. You asked me to login so I tried to and then you said I had used facebook so I should do the same. When I tried to do that, it then said I had a regular account and I should use that. So then I tried to use google but the level of information you requested, I felt it was egregious and unnecessary. I finally got it to work, but let's talk about topics. They are too broad. Nutrition should not include weight loss tips or workouts -- yet oddly it does. If I want weight loss tips, that should be in dieting. I keep removing categories because they are too broad. Also outdoors shouldn't contain camping equipment. Anyway, I'm sure it's not easy to curate all of these topics, but more narrow topics are good in my book since there are so many. Likewise the first article in literature is advice on writing. Yes, it's related but it also seems to miss the point. There is a writing category for which this seems perfect."

Would also like more control over the content that is surfaced in the app (it's not always clear why something is appearing in my boards). I find myself using Facebook and Twitter more and more to consume my news (used to use Flipboard almost exclusively). Gotta keep ahead of them, guys!

I became frustrated with Flipboard after waiting five days to set up my Facebook and Twitter accounts (and lets be realistic, that's the biggest draw for this app).  However, I really do believe it was worth the wait.  While the interface is radically different than anything you've ever seen on Facebook or Twitter (and really exemplifies LINKS that your friends share with you, not so much their status updates and photo posts), it's a very fun way to catch up with your News Feed and Tweets when you've missed a bunch.  The price is right (free!), the design is wonderful, and I do believe that once all the sign-up kinks are worked out, it will be well worth the wait.  I remain confident that Flipboard will continue to advance this app, and hopefully offer the ability to set up custom RSS feeds so you can add whatever website you want and see it in a magazine view."

However they opened up invites via email, and I signed up only a couple of days back yet already got my email. Entered Facebook and Twitter, and it looks absolutely beautiful the way it presents things. It will take tweeted links and go ahead and load up the page or article. Facebook looks great with the videos and things people post, though I do wish it had more recent updates than it now has. (Which was only about three short pages worth)"

It sinks flawlessly with a google reader account, Facebook, rss, you name it.

The text of stories is very readable and simply displayed as well."

You could spend hours reading Flipboard in one sitting without getting bored.  Next time you open up the app, a whole new bunch of articles to explore!  Love how it gives you previews of articles and then -- with one click --  takes you directly to the article's source.  It's like having HUNDREDS of magazine subscriptions.  Because there is so much content, you can easily find stuff you want to read.  When you purchase a (hard copy) magazine subscription, how many articles do you skip over (I'd say 50% or more in my case)?  Then you feel guilty because you paid $47 for the year!  Ads are minimal here and mostly on source article pages.  The page ""flip"" is uber neat on the iPad.  I still have more to learn on setting ""customization"" but it all seems intuitive.  Did I mention the great pictures?  LOVE THIS APP!"

There is little that needs to be changed, though.  Like I would love if we could change the size of our news tiles, so if we used say photography a lot in a day, we could make it bigger.  I would also love if we could integrate a photo feed into our front news stand.  So we could have a public photo feed with friends and say someone could post a city from a vacation there and we could keep it running if we wanted to.  I'd also like if we could it as many news tiles as we can, because I find it very difficult to chose the tiles I need (I have A LOT of tiles.... I'm very up to date I guess you could say!). This app is fantastic and I would love to see how far this goes in the future, and hopefully what I said and hope for gets put into the next update.  Overall, GREAT JOB!!!"
3326,hopesdead,"December 10, 2012",2,"Uneven UI/Content Balance Flipboard does fit a category of news apps that are customizing the experience for social news discovery (whatever that really means). I could use another app like Pulse or Zite for custom news (which the definition of custom is different) and I do (Pulse incase you are wondering). The UI for Flipboard is a little old and played out at this point in the app's history. The use of the flipping page turn animation for supported sources is nice but not used across all sources, leaving us with a broken experience that focuses on content more than a balance of content and UI. Until the UI is more complete across the board I can't find myself enjoying the use of Flipboard. Also I don't really see why their is so much social network into the UI layout when a user may choose not to share or even connect their accounts at all. Overall I find this app to be a niche news app that attracts  users with the UI and that alone is overwhelmingly overpowering when you get deep into the content the app has to offer (which can be hit or miss depending on what type of news reader you are)."

Most of the last few updates have made it better and better of late — especially appreciated the ability to give a thumbs down to articles in the aggregator that I wasn’t interested in, but I didn’t like the update that took away the ability to add nuances such as which specific topic made me uninterested in the article rather than simply not liking a particular website."
3328,GerryG39,"March 10, 2016",5,"Flipboard has become increasingly worse since merger with Zite When Flipboard merged with Zite, I expected the product to eventually incorporate the features of both. Unfortunately, that has not occurred. In Zite, it seemed that the user could identify subjects of interest and Zite would find relevant material globally. In Flipboard, it seems that the user selects sources of interest and the material is aggregated into a section called cover stories. The particular magazines and blogs selected by the user are added to the selection screen. This provides no real benefit to the user as it simply provides two ways to access the same information. The Zite approach provided the benefit of finding sources that the user may have been totally unaware of. Additionally, the incorporation of full page ads into posts is annoying at best. Formatting these ads a articles within magazines or providing a paid method of eliminating them would be desirable."

All you had to do was sign in and choose your topics and your good to go. The new version muddles with that. Now when you want to follow technology your given topics such as : search engine optimization, software technology, computer science, wearable technology. Sure that's cool that you have all of those topics and all, but now when I want know anything that's happened in the past day or two within technology I have to spefically go into what topic I want know from. That's a bit annoying, annoying enough for me to just use another app that brings me all the news so I don't have to search for the topic and then the news. Having broad topics allows users to generalize what they want, not many people want such spefic topics. Sure that's useful when your doing research and all but I'm reading for leisure and to catch not so I can figure out search engine optimization tools.

This app is incredible the way it plugs everything its ease of use and it's seamless literally blow me away.

3341,Warner Tabor,"July 26, 2011",5,"Great new reader Flipboard is a excellent news reader. It will snag rss feeds from any URL that you feed it (as long as there is one to snag) & also offers you some nice aggragated feeds right out of the box. It has some pretty clever GUI features, like displaying images from the latest stories when viewing your favorites, and the newspaper/ magazine metaphor is really well executed. It will occasionally crash, usually when trying to watch videos, but it does so far less often than Pulse. My only other gripe is that I sometimes end up going back to the rss snippet from the webpage when trying to scroll back to the top of the page. This only happens when a story is displayed in the split rss / webpage view, and is really more of an annoyance than a real problem. All in all these are very minor blemishes on an otherwise beautiful app. Nice work guys."

3344,Liberal college student,"August 30, 2013",5,"The amazing aspects of flipboard Flipboard is a great app but has some flaws. It is in no way the one stop shop that I originally thought when reading it's description. Especially if you're are hoping to use it to keep updated on world politics, economics and general news etc... You would be better off reading articles posted on the several standalone news apps each day. That said, some portions of the app are incredible, especially the technology section. The Flipboard staff that function and gather information for the technology section of the application find articles that are incredibly interesting, often brand-new that are posted on random and totally obscure news sites that I'd never be able to find my own. This makes keeping updated with the technology news a breeze and for that alone I love the app."

I like the interface fat better than Apple news. Flipboard lets me follow and organize my sources of content. It also lets me create and organize my own, topical ""magazines"" that others can follow. I now maintain over 100 of these magazines and generate enough interest with these to have built an audience on Flipboard of more than 10,000 followers. I discover new, interesting things from the sources of content I follow, and I learn from those who follow my magazines and comment or repost that content. In this way Flipboard has become – for me – a wonderful tool for discovering, learning and sharing. It's great on an iPhone, an iPad or even on a computer. I highly recommend it."

It seems as if muting settings aren't saved either as I will remute a topic multiple times and it still shows. Content runs out quickly and hitting refresh often results in ""no new content"". Seriously? There are thousands of articles and blogs posted every second, running out of content on the internet isn't a sentence that should exist. There also doesn't seem to be much content from credible news sources and mostly what shows up on my feed (not sure why) is parenting magazines, celebrity gossip sites and a lot of stuff and Netflix and Instagram. When the content is loaded from the site, the formatting is usually screwed up and/or it takes several seconds for the page to load properly. Every 4 flips or so expect to see ads. They are repetitive. I pretty much only use this app after I've exhausted my news feeds, which unlike this one, usually takes hours."

I would like to have 3 pages of content instead of just 2.  I would also like to see the Facebook content page allow me to view and compose messages, and to allow me to search and view my friends' photo albums.

That app was called Zite. The promise has been that we'd be able to log into Flipboard with our Zite credentials - which should save us the time of having to recreate our lists of interests - but 7 months on and that doesn't work yet. Pity, 'cause I'm curious to see if I can stand the gimmicky interface with my preferred set of topics. As it is, the original account I set up with Flipboard is still clunky and unappealing to me, and truthfully I don't want to wade thru the hoops of tailoring it anymore.

In some cases, Flipboard will pull articles that are not of interest but when reader tries to indicate that they want 'less' of this kind of story, they key word is still of interest.

But ok,  I get it advertisements are part of many apps.  And allows many to provide their service for free to the customer,  but when the pop up can't be closed or backed out of.

3361,Tninaz,"January 22, 2012",4,"Good aggregator Flipboard is the best media aggregator I have found yet.  Good easy to read and easy to use/setup with a great interface.  It supports many of the most popular media sources as well as social media apps.  Weaknesses:  1). It needs to rapidly expand the sources it can connect to.  Examples that 'should' be supported but are not are: Google+, Foursquare, Yelp, Path, Pulse, Groupon, but possibly also zinio, dwell, google news, google currents, living social, etc.  2) it lacks any filtering or advanced functions.  For instance you will see every post from every friend on Facebook all the time... Instead it should mimic whatever subscriptions/filters you have already set up in Facebook."

3363,ACSU29,"April 28, 2012",5,"Wonderful I've been looking for a Google Reader feed app for sometime now to replace the app I'd previously used. Nome of the ones I tried seemed right: an option was missing, stories wouldn't load, or the interface left much to be desired. Then I tried Flipboard. It is truly a  beauty to see–the creators certainly understand the iOS aesthetic. But it is also thorough, having the options one would want, and easy to navigate. As an earlier reviewer wrote, I find myself reading more of my feeds rather than clicking ""Mark all as read,"" I'm great part because of the layout. The app's ability to pull from FB and Twitter is an added bonus, and I am very thankful that it syncs with my Flipboard on my iPhone. "
3364,Jameszzzz,"November 5, 2012",5,"It's just awesome! I don't like to read news in English in general. I prefer my native language (Chinese) websites in general. Lots of news apps like CNN, cbsnews, and many more failed to attract me until I see Flipper. The beautiful awesome interface immediately grabbed my attention. I became a big fan since the first time I used it.  I love the flip design, the scanned copy of news papers, the different interesting font style and size. And its news picking and collection are excellent.  Now I keep using it to read news almost daily. The flipper team did a wonderful job to attract non-native language speakers like me."
3365,justdevon,"January 2, 2013",5,"Beautiful and convenient For someone who used to only look at Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on a regular basis, but wanted more to read, Flipboard was a great addition. I wanted to be more connected to the world through news and other articles, but didn't want a thousand apps. Flipboard gives you many facets of life from many different sources. Because of all the sources, you do get a lot of repetitive news stories, but just a quick flip takes me to the next story. One improvement suggestion that may or may not be achievable, allow users to post to Instagram from Flipboard and communicate in private Facebook messages. The only reason i have the Instagram app is to post pictures and the Facebook Messenger app to message. Other than that, it's a great app and so beautifully designed."
3366,Kbmuse29,"March 15, 2014",5,"Flipboard Review - The Ultimate Newsfeed App Once I figured out that Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and LinkedIN could all be used for streaming current news feeds on topics i'm interested in... such as the Oculus Rift, Google Glass, Life Hacker, Ray Kurzweil, etc...  It became difficult to keep up surfing through the news feed for each social media app.  The solution - tie all of the social media app news feeds into Flipboard.  Flipboard organizes the top stories and allows you to browse through the current news feeds and in addicting turn page style manner.  Add to this an organizing capability that allows you to create and share magazines (that rivals pininterests organizing feature) and you have a great app that provides a fun and convenient way to find articles on topics you're interested in and show the world what you've discovered."

No matter if I selected normal, large, or extra large, the text size remained the same. Contacted support through the app's 'contact us' and very quickly received the answer: I needed to force close the app after changing text size for it to take effect. A little quirky maybe, but solved the problem immediately, so no big thing at all. Love an app with real support.  What I really love though is to be able to flip though the latest stories from my favorite sources without having to wade through all the crap that calls itself news. I make that decision. Stories are constantly updated. Also love the one click share. So yes, I love it."

3371,INTPTT,"May 15, 2011",5,"Exceptionally good, but not perfect This is by far one of the best apps available for digesting online information. Not only does the interface make browsing the information you want a breeze, but it encourages you to read things instead of skipping over stuff you may miss. My only complaint - it's not ""intelligent"" like Zite (another must have app for this purpose alone.) If there was a way for it to learn what you like, just as Zite offers, this would be the only app you would ever need for information, be it tech, news, lifestyle, or any of your social network flavors. It's the first one I peek at when I want to know what's going on, though i still turn to Zite to make sure I don't miss something. Highly recommended - set it up your way and feast on the information available!"

3374,Charlie NW,"June 25, 2013",5,"The new newspaper. I love reading certain topics. Especially the most current version of stories. I was realizing more and more that local newspapers weren't reflecting information that 1. I wanted to read about and 2. We're accurate based on recent information. Additionally, the speed of some tv and online news outlets meant publishing in-verified info and suggestion. With this app, reading is a pleasant experience and I feel I get a lot out of it. The news is completely catered to my interests and I can isolate the biased news for after I've read the facts. Perspective like this just isn't available from a single publication. I wouldn't own a table without this, it just isn't worth it. Thank you so much for making this available on do many mobile platforms. INCREDIBLY USEFUL."

This seemed really promising as a place that I could look at all my social feeds and various feeds from news sources that I like altogether. Unfortunately, I just don't get this. I can't modify what appears in the cover stories, which appears to be the main focus of the app. I'm really not interested in FOX news or most of what is in there. I'd love for all the social feeds to be interspersed into one feed, otherwise what's the point of adding another app to look at them separately? The functionality is not intuitive, it's possible the features I want are there but how would I know? The only thing I seem to be able to do is add individual articles or posts to a ""magazine"" -- what is the point of that? I came here after trying the new Facebook app ""Paper"" and I heard this was better. Although there is more ability to personalize here, I still can't personalize to the extant I wish and the look is not nearly as pretty."

Now with the new version, i can no longer recommend it to people.  Its lost that edge and  relevence it once had.  Now is seem more associated with ""fluffy news"" outlets and the other ones are still there in the windows but i see the junk information/news more often than the less popular and more relvent news that i once received.   If Flipboard is going to stay in its current format, maybe there is a way to tell those that have been with it  since the begininng how to keep the fluff off the news feed. May be  you could have (or maybe there is) a ranking system that can keep the most relevent info in the news feed and leave the other info in the windows for viewing on occation.

I finally finish and now I have to sign in to read my magazine?? Why oh why can I not read the news and be anonymous? Why does everyone want to track everyone? No thanks. Miss Zite big time. I have been a Zite user since day one and I am so disappointed in Zite being sold and subsequently shut down, it should have been the other way around, kill Flipboard and bring back Zite. I have also owned flipboard from the day it was featured in Apple's keynote with Steve Jobs. While I have used flipboard a few times it was inferior to Zites elegance and its ability to figure out exactly what my interests are. Flipboard on the other hand shows me the same articles over and over even though I already read them. Some articles are days and weeks old. I am now looking at news360 and Apple's News as viable alternatives. There is no way flipboard can take the place of Zite. RIP Zite"
3378,PassionfishinFL,"June 28, 2016",4,"Flipping Amazing! I've had this app for a while & thoroughly enjoy the ability to not only flip through current news, but to fashion my own magazines to share. That's one of my fav aspects of the app because I can create magazines that reflect my tastes AND interact with other readers across the globe. This takes me to my 4* rating. Recently there was a glitch which erased all of my 'likes'. Cust. Service Rep Jason was quick to respond & helpful...except I never recovered 2,000 missing likes, ouch. That being said, top notch support & Jason gets 5*****stars for diligently trying to right the ship. Only neg comment I have is that you'll run across a few potty-mouthed, knuckle-dragging Neanderthals who feel the urge to spew nonsense. However, they can either be muted from your feed or reported (for the real degenerates) and removed. Thanks Guys! Highly recommend the app to everyone."

Like the ability to comment and read comments.  Still struggle with differences between tablet and phone.  Would like landscape for phone.  Would love the NYT to relax its grip on their content a bit.  Can the flipboard folks get that to happen?  We shall see how flipboard handles issues going forward.  Wrote the previous section of the review a while back.  To date none of the changes have been made.  Still a 5 star place to get news.  You can fine tune the bias out by seeking articles from sources with opposing view points.  Not keen on the ads but, hey, people have to make a buck."
3380,Stephanie Leal,"September 28, 2010",5,"incredible Now this is what the ipad was made for. beautiful layout. easy to figure out and organize. What the app does is take free websites (smitten kitchen blog, my FAV!) and lays them out in a style similar to the magazine ""The Week"" or a shortened newspaper ""quick read""... then you can jump to the full article online if you like right from the app... jumps to the page, then you can close it and be back in the app. no opening of safari, etc. brilliant. the ""pages"" flip like a fold-in-half newpaper. and there are loads of options.  Yes, facebook and twitter feeds available. but why bother when you can catch up on national geographic, the awl, Wired Magazine, and many others. Make it your own, delete and add what you like. Just brilliant. Prob my favourite app I've yet to come across... and free. Wicked."

The new version is a little annoying when viewed with the iPad on it's side. Up right it's fine but when turned on it's side the content falls to the left and the menu and dead space falls to the right. This goes against common design. Normally menus or what seems like menus  go on the left. I don't know why you changed it from the last version. Was it because you wanted the user to have a visual key that something changed? I see no reason to buck the standard, there is no benifit and it just makes it odd using it in a non standard way. I would prefer it's changed back, but I wouldn't give up this app if you didn't.  Just voicing my thoughts. "

This is the finest example of an app utilizing the large canvas to its fullest potential. Social networking is so much more engaging in this format. Seeing your tweets displayed as if they were published in a magazine is an awe-inspiring experience. This is without a doubt the best way to stay up-to-date on all of the things that matter to you most. Politics, technology, sports, social networking, whatever you can think to be interested in, this app displays it in an intuitive, unique way that is a pleasure to use. I use flipboard upwards of 15 to 20 times a day. I can't imagine my life without it at this point. Bravo to the developers, and thank you for showing me why I bought an iPad."

It seemed to have been broken because I could not access the tabs at the bottom of the screen. I deleted it and reinstalled it to detail the bugs I was facing and that seemed to correct my issues. The only thing that is a bit of an annoyance, and a minor one at that, is the unlabeled buttons when you are in the profile screen. The unlabeled buttons should be going from left to right, Find People to Follow Edit Profile, and Settings. Thanks for a great news app! I don't have any Facebook contacts I follow, so for me, it is typically used for news. It is one of my very favorites! Kudos to the developers for keeping it accessible to the blind and visually impaired."

3387,chris.yarsawich,"February 12, 2016",5,"My Favorite News App, perfect for teachers! I LOVE Flipboard. They provide a broad spectrum of news stories to ensure I get multiple, competing perspectives on current events. I can't stress enough how important this facet of Flipboard is.

3388,Kenramonet,"April 28, 2016",5,"Flipped Out Over Flipboard I admit to having initial skepticism with this service. One of the more positive aspects I had long grown accustomed to in daily reading of the NYT was the intangible factor of ""discovery"" I.e. the serendipitous discovery of an article on a topic that may have held little or no prior interest for me but after reading I became better informed and grateful to the editorial staff for choosing to include it in the paper. If I chose to be fed only those topics in which I currently have interest, my knowledge base becomes vertical without any horizontal broadening of my knowledge. That didn't sound good to me. "
3389,H. McCrackin,"September 29, 2016",5,"Bar none, the best and original visual news aggregator for iPad I've followed their app upon general release at the beginning, and with each release version it got better and better. Sure, there's a learning curve for each revamp, but if you take the time to let it absorb in, it's as intuitive as the first time you used it. Kudos to the team for the impending Zite integration. Will be going on Flipboard more often to get familiarized with all the features!"
3390,CSSVT,"July 23, 2010",5,"Don't listen to negative reviews I'll bump the 4 stars up to 5 stars when twitter and facebook are able to be used but there's absolutely NO reason to listen to negative reviews. What those reviews don't tell you are that this app is still usable and still pulls articles from twitter feeds like CNN, the Economist, and others with or without your credentials. There are still a ton of articles and twitter/facebook are only going to be added to make the app better. Go ahead and download it now, add your creds when the option becomes available, and enjoy what they currently have included in the app...you won't be disappointed. For what it's worth though, It'd be nice to have a few more streams to choose from in the sections there are already on the app."

I generally do not read the news and rely on StumbleUpon to find my reading/entertainment for the day. Flipboard has changed this for me. I love that you can customize the items that show up in your feed and organize them at will. The only thing that this app is missing is the ability to tag articles to read later. I constantly flip to a good read only to be distracted by something and then not be able to find it again to finish reading or to share. Please add a favorites feature, and maybe even the ability to have your favorites show up as a category. Otherwise, great app!"

I love the page flip action, it makes you feel like you're flipping through a real magazine. You have seemingly unlimited subscription depth and coupled with social media integration your magazines will flourish with a variety of contemporary media stories and information. I've said this before and will restate it again in this review... FlipBoard is without a doubt the future of digital publishing."

I read maybe 20 articles a day off it while I'm eating, relaxing, waiting, you name the activity and flipboard is the perfect app to fill the gap. It hardly ever crashes, is highly customizable (in terms of the content), easy to use (solid UI), and super beneficial (this app is responsible for me keeping up on tech news, app news, apple news, world news, local news, and most importantly video game news).

3394,NPTVN,"May 13, 2014",2,"Glitchy In a ridiculous attempt to try and ""smarten"" the app layout, Flipboard has become an annoying way to get a lot of news I don't want simultaneously. What is the point of choosing categories if you are going to mash them up together and force your stupid ""Cover Stories"" section on everyone every time you open the app? Do you put all your meals in a single bowl along with dessert and go at it one spoonful at a time? No! Then why would you put all the news together? Maybe this approach works for the ""ADD, on-the-go, three seconds attention span, no time to read more than 140 characters"" generation, but I sure as hell don't want to read disturbing news from the Middle East followed by an UPROXX countdown of worst NBC tv shows. Plus, you're app is all glitchy now, trying to watch a video is almost impossible, and when trying to open an article on Safari, that app starts to malfunction too. Get it together, Flipboard."
3395,where's Google,"January 13, 2015",4,"Great app, 1 issue I really don't see how anyone could say the articles are biased or of poor quality because Flipboard is a collection of articles from many different websites including ones from major news papers and magazines. Sure it is the Internet, and you should not trust everything you read anyways, but it is not necessary to be extra skeptical. My only complaint is that I signed in with Google on my Samsung S4 and there is no option to sign in with Google on the Apple version. Also when I use my email to sign in a pop up tells me to try signing in with Google, I assume because my email is linked to the Google account. Please add the option to sign in with Google or at least to let me sign in with my email regularly with out a pop up telling me to do otherwise."

I no longer forward the article. "
3397,Atlstjohn,"November 17, 2016",5,Great but flawed The good: as an aggregator it has a broad reach. I'm still surprised at the vast collection of content.

3400,jphuff,"September 26, 2010",5,"Absolutely great! Ok, the first Flipboard was good enough to become my primary newsreader, but the update has given just about everything I could have wanted.  The interface changes your websites into easily readable and perfectly formatted magazine line sections.  Viewing the comments and a shortened version of the article is great and not having to leave and go to a browser to view the entire article is better yet.  The only thing I'd like added to this app is the ability to specify my own websites to be added to a section rather than having to depend on websites that are pre-selected.  Still, the selection of sites is pretty darn extensive, so while I'd LIKE to see that feature, I won't be complaining about the lack of it."

Would have given 5 stars except for two things. The UI is anchored in the ""flip"" but sometimes you arrive at an article that scrolls instead of flips. I wish it were consistent. Secondly, when you initially download the app it is loaded with almost exclusively left-wing media. It took me hours of muting sources to force the app to select a balanced news menu. I wish it would learn my preferences or allow me to set parameters. As an example: The only sport I want to follow is soccer and that's about the only sport it never pulls news for."
3404,RandomBonehead,"November 9, 2012",2,"Doesn't really do the trick There's no good overview of lots of content - just one story or one category at a time, it seems optimized for presenting advertising. (Very little of that is present, but if the interface is so amenable to it, it can't be far away.)  The ""stock"" categories are populated with well-known but weak sources. The ""flip"" as a way to change pages is a time-wasting gimmick. This app pushes the user to spend to much time fussing with the interface and not enough time absorbing content, this is Flipboard's biggest problem.  The search was unable to find and setup most of my favorite blogs.  There's an emphasis on aggregating personal social media, not exactly what I'd call useful in a ""news reader"". News = current events that have a substantive impact on large numbers of people as well as well-written, interesting pontification/editorials; social media = ""OMG there was a finger in my McNuggets"" as well as celebrity worship. No thanks."

Flipboard's presentation of articles and interpretation of gestures could be improved. I don't care for the touch-sensitive page control at the bottom of sections because I only hit it by accident. Sometimes the app opens an article when I try to tap the back button. I don't like when an article must be scrolled vertically like a regular webpage. I don't understand why I can only have three pages of interests. I think that Twitter content could have better visual presentation. Tile rearrangement could behave better. Tapping something on the home screen should take me to the relevant content, but does nothing. I am using an iPad mini, so some issues might be because of the new physical dimensions of this screen."

Not only do I like sharing information this way, I also like being able to see other's collections.....which is a real time saver when you can find someone who already aggregates information on topics of interest to you.

This is a case of form leering over - not following - function. Much appreciate other users pointing out News 360 as an alternative; I immediately downloaded it and deleted Flipboard with no regrets. Still I miss the intuitive Zite interface, how easy it was to select topics of interest, and how easy it was as one reviewer noted to keep out lousy articles related to odious and repellent presidential “candidates” like Trump et al. On Zite if I had the Politics topic a thumbs down for unwanted articles was refreshing along with the “we’ll try better next time”.

At first I thought it was coincidence. Take it a step further. I was using the app under an anonymous user name and it was still able to connect me (my personal work/school life, etc) to my anonymous user ID and send me obscure targeted ads. Thru it's algorithms it knew exactly who I was. Big data is nothing new. They're  constantly farming your info. I get it. We have enough conspiracy theories.

That is at least until I discovered flipboard. It has actually made reading the news as well as following my favorite social media and websites fun and easy! I can read snip its to get a general idea of what is going on, and then make the decision if I want to jump over to the full article (in the case of some feeds which only provide the snip it). Some feeds such as the NY times actually provide the entire article in the feed. I also love that links, including media links, open up right in the app. Awesome job! I hope other apps are taking a lot of notes!"

3415,palabrajot,"August 30, 2013",4,"Big fun, small compromises in functionality. It's a wonderful app, adding the appealing beauty of magazine style layouts to the otherwise bland content of social network feeds. The one thing which keeps it from being perfect for me are the little compromises to usability.  The biggest oversight which comes to mind is that while browsing Tweets, it doesn't show the full 140 characters.  It cuts the longer ones off, forcing you to tap on each entry to expand them, and another tap to return to browsing. Hardly necessary, and one of the biggest reasons I don't use it often.  Other, similar little shortcomings as Flipboard relates to other services like Facebook are the reason I keep a copy of each service's app alongside Flipboard, otherwise I might be using it for all my browsing."
3416,Aaronito33,"October 8, 2013",5,"Great UI and functionality I take my rss and news apps pretty seriously. I used to use feedly, but as soon as I switched there was no going back. Has export capabilities for just about every blog/social network you could think of. I highly recommend downloading Pocket (used to be called read it later) to access saved articles from any device. Only thing that could be better we're if it had more than 4 source display pages and sorted an aggregated list by time. Flip book has more than enough preexisting sources, but if you're not satisfied with those you can search for feeds on tumblr, Wordpress, blogspot, URL, instagram, twitter, Facebook, and google reader. "
3417,Peaceperson,"November 23, 2013",2,"What happened to comments? For some reason the update has taken away the comments segment of this app on over half of the articles. To be sure, the articles that lack a comment section are mostly conservative related ones and the articles that do have comments are such not relative material that no one bothers putting in their two cents. All I see now is defense of Obama articles and the like. Mostly I just want to say no, but I have no voice in this app. This is much like the actual America. If you don't agree with Obama, you better shut up because he is the supreme leader. I despise this liberal infested segment of rock that used to be a beautiful land. Let's all kiss every foreign power's backside until we lose all dignity we had. This app is pretty much the final insult of what a good news source used to be. So when you add back all the comments to every article, then you will have your five stars."

What I like best is the ability to choose your interests, and then also choose which interests you want to read about NOW. The tile approach allows me to read all headline news in the morning - or not. I can skip it all, and read about the universe, new software for my Mac, or browse photos of the day - without having a bunch of stories about things I'm not interested about at the moment mixed in. You can also page back a few days if you started an article but didn't finish, or saw an advertisement you are interested in, but didn't' act on. I love it. My search for MY perfect news app is over.

I was already reading my daily feeds though google reader, but flipboard makes that experience so much more enjoyable. Because I can add facebook, twitter, flickr as well as the rss feeds, it's almost a one-stop app for getting my news and blog posts. I still use my favorite rss app (Reeder) when I need a very quick rundown of headlines, but the flipbook provides the casual interface of browsing through a magazine. I think the way it processes your Facebook wall and twitter feed is genius. AND it's free. I high recommend downloading it and just adding your twitter feed and see what you think."

I have a 16 GB iPad and I noticed that even though I only had a handful of apps, nearly all of my storage space had been used. This perplexed me so I systematically removed apps and found that Flipboard consumed around 6 GB (yes Gigabytes) of space. "

Flipboad culls information from various news sources and populates the content in a beautifully designed page capsule environment. What could be fixed or improved: a few more international news picks, sound does not load on some of the embedded videos, and better content oversight.  Example the Trevon Martin case turned up oddly in both celebrity and San Francisco local news.  Music news is more a celebrity showcase of what celebrity is going to concerts.  Bonus points for the beautiful issue covering modern day explorers under the Flipboard   Picks.  Cutting edge use of infographics and photo journalism to reel the reader in are both top tier."

And it might also expose you to new, more reliable or relevant news providers. Use this app to sort the wheat from the chaff, and subscribe to the sources that you find most trustworthy and relevant.

And in fact would love to eliminate the need of using MobileRSS or Reeder Apps from my phone to use my google reader account. However, Flipboard lacks one simple feature that every RSS reader app has by default. A ""Mark All As Read"" option. I use RSS feeds for most of my web reading. As Flipboard has an amazing feature to share articles in your social circle, it fails when looking through your news feeds. Having to tap and hold to get the ""Mark Artcle as read"" on each article is horrible. How can I keep proper track of my RSS feed without relying on another Application? This is where Flipboard comes up short. However, it's one of the best experiences in reading news that's out there."

I read flipboard for about 45min every day. Over the course of this time interval it has crashed as often as once every 2 min. That's over 20 times in one day. I know all the tricks: quit the app, reset the device, you know the drill. None of that helps. Just installed latest update which stated that it addresses the crashing on ios5, and have experienced several crashes already. What makes this all the more frustrating is that when I relaunch the app is never puts me back at the article I was just reading. Developers need to take more responsibility for crappy coding and stop constantly implying that it is the OS causing the problem. I love the content and design-but I'm fed up with getting halfway through an article and not being able to finish it. Seriously people-get it together!"
3436,jasonabullard,"October 18, 2015",1,"Explicit Content Parents beware. I have been using flipboard for a few months now and have been shocked at the lack of parental controls. First they rate the app as 4+ which means this app is available and suitable for anyone 4 years and older. However, the content that is selectable (I.e. Photography, computer subjects, etc) and viewable is not filtered based on this same age restriction. For instance, I have read explicit language in several articles; nudity and many other adult oriented content. I emailed the developers and have yet to hear back. I understand the app by itself is actually pointless until you start selecting categories that you want more articles about which is probably how they get around the age limit and explicit rating. If I find a way to report this to Apple I will.  Also, I find it funny that their license states use of the app by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited yet they have a 4+ age requirement."

The quality of the cover stories has gotten better, I like the smart magazines, and it took me a few seconds to find where all my custom magazines had gone but once I figured that out it made sense. Seems to me there's a lot of griping because people hate change. I think the changes are innovative and the interface is cool. My comment to the developers: Good job. Some of us like what you did. Take the complaints into consideration, but don't be discouraged. Continue to be inspired."

HOWEVER, I really wish when you compose a tweet in this app when you start to mention someone and type their name, a Dropbox would appear to select the person (like the official twitter app), because that doesn't happen.  So in essence you have to know their twitter name, character for character, to ensure that your actually mentioning them. This is why I only gave it 4 stars. Fix this and it's easy 5 stars.

3445,Evil_Ed,"December 1, 2015",1,This is an awful replacement for Zite Ever since they started offering a migration path to Flipboard from Zite I have been trying to get used to their interface. It is nowhere near what Zite had set up. Flipboard has none of the features that made Zite so easy to use and efficient at providing articles. I really wish that they had incorporated all of Zite into Flipboard or even dropped the Flipboard app completely in favor of Zite. The user interface is annoying and makes it needlessly difficult to find the articles and it does not appear to really take into account the users previously selected articles and favorite subjects to suggest articles. It doesn't even seem to have access to the same set of magazines and other resources that the Zite app had. All in all I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience and will have to go in search of a new resources for aggregating the articles I would like to see.
3446,carrvanpool,"January 4, 2016",4,"Pretty Good, Flipboard! So I've let go of my love for Zite, and reconciled my mixed feelings about Flipboard, and I think it's a pretty great way to keep up on a great variety of news topics. The flipping is annoying, to me, perhaps not to others, and although while reading articles you can't see your clock/battery/signal strength, but overall, pretty great. You can even create your own magazines, and share them. Even eating crow about formerly thinking Zite was better. It wasn't, but I preferred its UX. Now: repeated crashing problems are waaaay annoying. Fire the person not fixing this. Otherwise read on and enjoy the current excellence of Flipboard content, and strong curation of articles.

3448,brotherwormgear,"August 22, 2016",3,"Y No Instagram or Facebook? Years ago Flipboard was my go-to application for nearly everything on the web. The best part about it, for me, was the way both RSS/news and also social media were aggregated neatly into Cover Stories. No other app does this which made Flipboard very unique. After the redesign, Facebook stopped showing up in Cover Stories and now can only be viewed on a separate page (and even there likes do not work; keeps prompting to login to FB but provides no username/password fields). Then, Instagram support was removed. My interest in  Flipboard quickly waned. I keep checking back, hoping the old features that made this such an amazing app would return. I would happily pay for a new version that could do what it used to do back when it was first launched."

It feels like reading a newspaper and is quite easy to use and figure out. It allows aggregation from a variety of sources and RSS feeds and makes even dull RSS look spiffy. What I like best is that it downloads the actual articles in the background on the fly so that when you are flipping pages or reading headlines you rarely have to wait at all for loads. The only slight downside is that the list of sources one can use use as input to get news from is not very very comprehensive (is is just comprehensive). Normally not an issue but I tend to not read mainstream news sources so for me this made it less thuan 100% optimal but only 95% :-)"

This puts everything you like into a clever magazine form. You customize the news stories your interested in, and ""flip"" through through them like flipping pages of a magazine. It also ties in your social life which I think is a little limiting, so it wont completely replace your Twitter and Facebook app. It does put post in a nice layout, so its good for quick check in. The layout is colorful (because of the pictures) and makes it very intuitive. I would defiantly recommend this, and don't even think about paying for a magazine app, above this app that goes above and beyond."
3452,A.Kinng,"January 9, 2012",1,"Flipboard was almost there... Then it vanishes from my iPad. Let me explain this very simple. I was browsing the whole web using just my Flipboard app. It was great. I can browse the websites I love and I was able to comment and read comments in a very stylish way. Then a couple of copy cats arrive at the app store offering more or less the same experience and try it out a couple of them. When I come back to Flipboard something changed. The comments section was only a retweet zone, the picture browsing became unusable, and most of the serious websites became digital magazines that push you out of the app to see videos or see galleries. So Flipboard has became a great Web-Launcher a tool that you don't need if you got bookmarks on safari that by the way let you see your websites as magazines with the new Reader feature. "
3453,MrFlibble1,"April 13, 2012",5,"Surprising good I guess you could call this an RSS reader.  It gives you the same information, but I think the creative way they present it makes it a little Moore accessible.  On my Mac I use Times which gives a very news paper feel to reading, and that is one of the things I like about this app.  Not only does it do an even better job of presenting an esthetically pleasing arrangement, but it allows you to combine RSS feeds into themes which took a while to get used to but I really was pleased once I mastered the system.  I can see this program not being for people who want just a list of news articles, but if you want form and function give Flipboard a try."

With Flipboard, I find it easy to research new topics and add to my feed. The Coverpage stories remain relevant to my interests. Unlike Zite, which only worked on iOS for me, I can access Flipboard on my MacBook also. My articles also do not gray out after I have accessed them.

Reopen flipboard and it does not remember where you were before the crash. No way to bookmark either. App will also crash while playing videos.

I have a iPhone, but the small screen didn't allow me good reading room.  When I opened clipboard for the first time, I realized that it was exactly what I was looking for.  Price is right (free).  Also,  advertisements are completely unobtrusive as they are like a full screen ad in a magazine.  I love the interface and ease of access for opening the original articles.

I really enjoyed experimenting with Flipboard when it first came out, but found myself deleting it and relying on other aggregators as I found it to be more style over substance. I downloaded it again on the insistence of a friend and am so grateful to them for making me give it another try. It's fabulous.  It's such a breathtakingly simple concept, and yet it has been carried out to near perfection.  If you ever craved a digital version of the morning papers, combined with a really wonderful way of visually presenting your own favorite social media outlets, then look no further.

If only it had a table of contents and index, that might tip the balance up to 5 stars.  It would be grand to go to the index of items by source, and choose my highest priority sources.  As things stand now, I have to scan through all my categories to find the few sources I have time to read.  Particularly a problem in the auto and style subject matter.  As a minor issue, I would like to have something like a centralized catalog of pre-defined sources so setting up my Flipboard with appropriate titles and selecting content would be less like a treasure hunt and more like a specification.

3466,JLackman,"January 16, 2015",1,Nice UI getting extremely biased with coverage I initially started using Flipboard because of the UI and knowing the history of some of the people involved. I was interested watching how the UI and the app developed.  However lately the stories are getting more and more slanted and it's getting hard to take. The bulk of the news feeds are full of extreme left wing liberal bias.  I have opened two tickets with the support team asking how I (the user) can control what information I am receiving. As the user I should have some input and be able to shape the type of news that I see. It would be relatively easy to allow users to simply blacklist news providers that they're not interested in reading. It seems this can be done with some authors but not with larger left-wing radical new sources that clog the main feeds. It's gotten to where I don't even use it that much anymore I just use Google news
3467,SamWOWz,"December 2, 2015",2,"Meh I loved Flipboard on my iPod and iPhone, though I deleted it from my iPhone due to its massive size, taking up all my storage. So I got it for my iPad, thinking it would be great on a larger screen. I hate it. Everything good about it is missing in the iPad version. You no longer flip up, but rather, browse sideways, like a normal magazine, with multiple stories on each page. When you open a page, it floats...doesn't stay centered and ""still""on the screen. Then, instead of flipping back, you need to hit the arrow in upper left corner. The original was cool, how you flipped through layers, so that even if you clicked on a link in an article, you could always go back by simply flipping backwards. Now, it's hard to tell where you're at within Flipboard. Just a really clumsy format, not elegant like the iPhone version. Now, it's just okay."
3468,AustxCyclist,"January 11, 2016",2,"Major battery drain on my iPad Pro First, I used to read Flipboard quite a bit, but like some other reviewers, I've found Apple News to be a really good alternative and pretty much stopped using Flipboard.  On a whim, I decided to fire it up today on my iPad Pro and used it for 1.8 hours (I know because I checked in the Settings App under battery).  I checked the battery usage because I was shocked to see my iPad Pro's battery was down to 54% after only using it for 2-3 hours today.  The iPad Pro has amazing battery life, so when I looked to see what was going on it turns out that Flipboard had consumed 52% of my battery life over the last 24 hours. "
3469,Bank and Crystal,"June 23, 2017",5,"Amazing! I have been looking for a app that distributes free news and media without having a subscription. Not only is it free but it is easy to use and made beautifully. I am so happy right now. This has made my whole year. I read the news and articles everyday and my main source has been from yahoo. Lately for the past few months there news isn't even news anymore. It's all about Kim kardashian and other celebrities that I don't care about. I want to read about science, politics, inventions, weather, and other topics that actually mean real news. Thank you for making this app! I felt that I should write a review to show my appreciation."
3470,nytiger73,"July 21, 2010",5,"Keep trying! This is an absolutely beautiful app. It's well thought out and has some very MAJOR potential. For those giving poor ratings, keep trying!  This app is very popular most likely because Ashton Kutcher tweeted about it. You will get it setup. It took me a couple of tries but I was able to get both Twitter and Facebook setup successfully. Hopefully they'll add some sort of refresh / auto refresh option as well as an option to post directly to your Facebook and Twitter accounts.  This app is gorgeous and is exactly the type of app Apple had in mind when they designed the iPad.  "
3471,Loneemperor,"December 16, 2010",5,"Fantastic app and now even better These guys know how to make an appealing and useful app. They seem to think of everything. I use it to read my wall on Facebook and to see messages on Twitter. I can read messages, see replies, and reply if I want to. I find it almost more useful than the apps designed for these programs."
3472,coromandal,"November 23, 2011",5,"Excellent, packed with interesting info I like this app much, much more than I expected to like any newsreader app. It's the first one I tried on my iPad. It works very well, the interface is visually great, easy to navigate, allows you to see enough to decide if you want to open and read the article. I especially like the editors' picks -- I get to see a wide-ranging selection of articles I might never have known about otherwise. They're drawn from many sources. I'm learning a lot. "
3473,crtek,"April 7, 2012",5,"Excellent app When I first downloaded this app I really did not use it at all.  I had another magazine style app that i found simpler to view.  Once I plugged in my Twitter and Facebook accounts and started using it, I found the real beauty of this app. It makes your social networking feeds a magazine style article giving them a unique look and feel.  I actually like this presentation over the default Twitter and Facebook applications.  The last few updates to the app have given it a better look as well. I love the cover story additions and watching my articles update as I log in. I have really gotten to love the flipping style, especially on my iPhone.  Definite 5 stars!!!!!!"
3474,Erwin Letellier,"March 30, 2014",4,Great App I love this app. It's essentially a universal app that allows you to see pretty much any news source available. Only two things preventing me from giving it 5 stars though:
3475,TropRockin,"March 21, 2015",1,"Crashing, frustrating and hate the flip I've moved to flipboard since Zite is going by the wayside. This app crashes often (iPhone 6 plus, iOS 8.2). I finally find something to read, open the article, start reading and Flipboard closes.  Have to (annoyingly) flip through 30 pages to get back to the article (tried to find exact article via Google, but I hadn't noted the publisher before crash), open the article again and CRASH. SCROLLING is 100x's more convenient than flipping. Scroll lets you get past several articles if they are not of interest. Flipping makes you ""touch"" every article. In a world where we are trying to streamline everything, flipping is moving backwards (and not in a good retro way).  I deleted this app a long time ago in favor of Zite.  Just my luck... crappy app buys the good app. No fair. I guess I'm on the search again for a better way to consume content."
3476,Will killer14,"June 29, 2015",5,"One of the better news apps. I have had this app for about 6 months now it's now the only news app I use. My favorite thing about it is that you get a wide range of editorial opinions. There are tons of newspapers, magazines and other stations that are pooled together. The longer you use the app the more topics you pick (for example social issues, science, technology, morals) the more accurate the article selections become. As strange as it sounds it like pandora for news. At first you put the thumbs down a lot and after a while the station becomes more tuned to you. It's not a perfect app but it's the best free news app I've seen out there."
3477,scarficusrex,"December 1, 2015",1,"An inferior technology trying to replace a superior one Once there was an app called Zite. Its interface was simple and to the point, but let the reader rapidly sift through articles. It did an amazing job of finding good articles, but of course, no one has time for every article so skimming is important."
3478,Ros3ndo,"October 8, 2016",4,Great content aggregator however with some limitations. This has been my go to internet content aggregator for more than a couple of years and this keeps itself at the top with timely and user advantageous update releases.
3479,R1Law,"April 21, 2017",5,"Best personal news aggregator/publisher but not perfect Of all the ways to follow news and other published information this is one of the best. Allows users to create their own magazines to store and or share information. Constant upgrades work to solve some of the nagging issues (a few dead links, occasionally wonky video links). The iPhone version is better than the iPad version if you follow lots of sources due to long scrolling capability - for some odd reason my iPad version limits the sources after a set number requiring a separate page view that loses the seamless scroll attribute. Still, my go to source for wisdom, insight, and inspiration."
3480,Geoker,"July 23, 2010",3,"Reality check. Sorry to the reviewers who had a collective orgasm when this came out, but it is simply not all that. The layout and elegance are 5 star, yes. Gotta take a star away for continued signup nightmare and the hey-you-like-us-too-much response. Unfortunately the content is not there yet. I have never heard of most of these sources and want to add the ones I read all the time like engadget and cultofmac. Also, my biggest beef: how do you choose what in my FB feed gets selected? So many status updates are ignored. Others languish forever for days. If I have to check Facebook all the time for posts, what's the point? "
3481,Steve from the Ranch,"July 29, 2010",5,"An incredible app I was lucky enough to download, install, and configure Flipboard before it went viral. As a result, I have full access to my Twitter and Facebook feeds, and I have to say that this app revolutionizes how you look at that information. "
3482,KrazyBig,"July 29, 2010",5,"Amazing Design - Amazingly Fast This is one of the first apps which begin to capture the potential of the new tablet form factor. The presentation of the content from the various feed options is impeccable. I find myself happily flipping through hundreds of articles in a sitting. And the key tothat is the apps amazing speed. I've tried a number of rss readers, and in all of them you find yourself waiting for minutes as they grind through and download the content. Flipbook typically has content preloaded and format so I rarely face more than a fraction of a seconds delay. Even the source website content is preloaded so it comes up instantly. "
3483,AmyAdair,"May 15, 2011",5,"My new favorite iPad app After using for a few days now, I've got to say how much I love this app. That I can see the articles and links from my twitter feed pulled into magazine form makes it even better than the quick show on the side in the Twitter app. My Facebook feed is now so much easier to navigate, and takes so much less time. Actually, it takes me less time to review my Twitter, Facebook, and Google Reader subscriptions than using apps for each just because of the way they are displayed. I can easily and quickly pick what I'd like to read, without having to process each one by clicking on it, going back, etc. So I love the display. "
3484,Mjackiw,"July 1, 2011",5,"Outstanding social program. Flipboard takes all your social content and turns it into a phenomenal iPad magazine.  You can read articles, see photos, connect with friends, post comments, and stay up to date in an encapsulating format."
3485,dirkdelor,"March 11, 2012",5,"Best News Consumption App This is by far the best way to consume news. I used to use a combination of twitter and other news apps like CNN, but Flipboard has completely streamlined my morning routine. I like the ""Flip"" sections, which are Flipboard's own curation of news sources organized around certain topics like ""Business"". It really provides some great content you may miss if you just read your own twitter stream. The app loads fast, moving in and out of articles and sections is really smooth. There's some nice social integration included. The developers have come a long way since it was introduced and the updates are fantastic. I don't know why you'd use anything else."
3486,Paul in NJ,"April 1, 2012",3,"Okay But Not 100% This app is very good, but has some glaring issues that need to be resolved still. First is that in many cases you cannot see the entire photo in both the Facebook and News subsections – you only see what shows up on the vertical portion of the screen, so you miss the right and left sides of the photo. Second is, you cannot save the photo that you're looking at back to your Camera Roll – you need to instead open it in Safari, which kind of defeats the purpose. Finally, your Facebook settings are not recalled, so you're reading posts from people that you normally don't see on Facebook because of the preferences you've set there. Other than that, it is nice to use. But it's not my number one go to app for the specific reasons mentioned."
3487,Kurt Fetter,"October 30, 2014",5,"Update Falls Flat This latest update for Flipboard include mostly window dressing.  Unfortunately this update completely removed what made Flipboard easy to navigate. No longer do you flip through pages...it's just an endless stream of content with zero way to organize. Before you could group content by page and ""Flip"" to the pages you wanted easily. This app took a step backwards and forgot what made them popular.  This is the same mistake coke made when launching ""New Coke.""  There are many other now that better organize the exact same content and articles. I recommend moving on to other news apps!"
3488,manamino,"November 23, 2014",4,"One stop shop for news Great intuitive, and easy to use gestures! Not only is this app is my 1 stop shop for news, it is also great to navigate around and follow a certain category."
3489,conzio,"February 12, 2016",5,"It's not perfect but... This site is not perfect, however, it has one of the most far reaching and in-depth consortium of content available.  It's hard to be critical of a site that does so much to bring such vast content to a single application.  Yes… I don't like some of the ads in the way that they are structured, however, I know that it's a means of them keeping the site free."
3490,Jeffyg3,"July 25, 2010",5,Simply beautiful design Quick review:
3491,Obravenewworld,"July 25, 2010",3,"Finally working (for some), but still not there. This app does some things great, but it still has a few shortcomings that need to be addressed in future updates."
3492,FrozenApe,"July 29, 2010",5,Great app with or without social networking features People are rating this one star because Twitter and Facebook features are not available. Who cares? This is a beautifully designed and executed app. I use it to browse the internet daily now. Definitely a showpiece for the iPad. Well done guys.
3493,Denrael,"July 31, 2010",2,"So much to love, if only I could Everyone seems to love this application. It is garnering rave reviews, and much talk on the social networks. Right up front I'll agree that it's beautiful in it's UI and extremely fun to use. No complaints there at all. Others have talked of all the good things about this app, so I'll focus on the areas I find it lacking."
3494,Godwin J,"August 3, 2010",5,Ignore the low star rating First off you should know that I do not personally know anyone associated with Flipboard. I am writing this view because I feel that this app needs some good reviews because it is worth eve single second I spend writing this review. Having said that I want you to know that you just have to try this app out if you are open to taking on a fresh approach to consuming tweets or going thru your Facebook feed.
3495,santoshb,"May 14, 2011",5,"There is always a better way to do things I am a developer and so I really appreciate the innovative browsing way flipboard team has introduced to the world. I am very selective reader but still had around  more than 10 favorites and so more often than not I started missing out important stuff on a daily basis. Very difficult to go and read all tweets I follow, the hacker news, few good forums and google reader, few financial news from bloomberg and ft and it was so difficult to go and read out these individual apps or directly on the web. Thanks to flipboard and congrates to the flipboard team. How can they came about such an incredible idea ? Amazing."
3496,TimHunter,"December 8, 2011",5,"Marvelous! I've never before felt compelled to review an iPhone app, but Flipboard did the trick. It is an amazing piece of software. Easy to use and beautiful to look at, Flipboard sets a new standard for iPhone apps. Browsing through ""Cover Stories"" or ""Flipboard Picks"" is like leafing through a general interest magazine while I'm standing in line, sitting in a coffee shop, or otherwise finding myself with a few minutes to kill. The only ""con"" I've identified is that it feels a bit over-friendly with Twitter. I'm not a Twitter user so that functionality is lost for me. However, that little infelicity was not enough to keep Flipboard from going directly to my Home screen. (And it's free!)"
3497,GroooovyChic,"March 1, 2016",5,"Easy and Awesome I love, love, love this app. Flipping through is super user friendly. As I ""do my homework"" for launching a small business, I can file articles away in my custom ""magazines""for study when I get to the next stage of development. It's a great learning tool and I find lots to inspire. This is perfect for entrepreneurs, students, or anyone who likes to read. "
3498,Cloimages,"September 18, 2016",3,"Must be improved The concept is good, better than good, the concept is fantastic. This is a brilliant way to read newspapers and magazines, and I use Flipboard every day."
3499,TE422,"July 24, 2017",5,No longer working Love this app and have used it forever but it won't even open at all now after the latest update.  Just frozen and will not work at all.  Bummer.
3500,Dakodeh,"April 14, 2011",5,"Great for More than just Social Networking Flipboard is wonderful. I downloaded it because I thought it would be an interesting way to view Facebook and other social media. What I didn't realize is that it would legitimately change the way I browse for information on the web. It takes information from any website, RSS feed, or blog, and converts it to an easy-to-read format that is beautiful to look at. It's astonishing how much easier it is to sit down and spend time reading information from a blog when it is formatted as if it were a magazine. It has become my most used app, and I really did not expect that."
3501,Frudoc,"June 16, 2011",4,Good App Very good reader. Looks spectacular. 
3502,avishal,"March 11, 2012",5,My day starts and ends with a Flipboard refresh Wonder why Apple doesn't have a news aggregator product.. and so I  obviously wonder why Apple hasn't acquired Flipboard yet.  UI seems Apple designed and to an Apple fan-boy's joy - available only on iOS. 
3503,YakBurger,"June 1, 2012",5,"Unstable...as ever It's baffling why this compelling app continues to suffer stability issues.  Although it no longer dumps you out every N page views, it now simply freezes after <10 page views.  I loved the PC/toolbar version, but with most of my content consumption now on the iPad, I rarely stumble from a lap/desk top.  Maybe it's the cosmos telling me to quit stumbling and go to sleep.  Whatever the cause, it's severe enough to limit/eliminate StumbleUpon from my iPad.  I expect it's temping to blame the web sites, but one need only look to Flipbook as the consummate aggregator.  It works beautifully and consistently. Maybe StumbleUpon should poach an architect or developer or two from Flipbook..."
3504,Your_Best_Friend,"April 7, 2013",5,"Easily my favorite app I have this on both the iPhone and iPad and it is the best app I've ever used.  Quick, responsive, and beautiful, but most importantly functional.  Flipboard is my twitter client, facebook client,  and it's own new finder all in one.  With tons and tons of great sections to read, in addition to your own personalized section, I always know when I open flipboard that something new and great is waiting for me.  Flipboard is what helps me manage everything I read.  No other news aggregator even comes close to the content, curation accuracy, personalization, polish, and legibility.  Every page looks beautiful.  I cannot recommend this enough."
3505,††The One And Only Warren Cain††,"November 6, 2014",5,"Flipboard has finally matured. Flipboard's already beautiful interface, with its clean design that lets each major source still retain its own unique style, mixed with its newly added topic-oriented magazine system makes for the best overall news app out there today.  This was the first update where I can honestly say I have found nothing major I would change."
3506,You Enjoy Myself,"May 4, 2015",4,Update: she's back!! Edit: she still loves me!! She came back after a third uninstall/reinstall. 
3507,m2usa,"October 10, 2015",4,"Pretty great with a few exceptions I have been a longtime Flipboard user. It's been a great addition to my iPad and iPhone. Still a great alternative to the News app from Apple. I like that I can say ""give me more or give me less"" in the content tool area. "
3508,Mohville,"November 17, 2015",5,"Great app - but better flipping UX needed This app is useful and a treat to use. One thing that can be improved though is the 'flip' flow. Currently it takes THREE taps to save an article for later reading: 1) tap the + button 2) select the 'magazine' to add the article into 3) tap 'add' to complete. This flow is only necessary when I specifically want to save an article in a particular topic pool. But more often, I only need to save articles for later reading. So there should be a simple (maybe separate from the 'add to a magazine' function) button that allows me to tap only once and the article instantly saved into a 'To read' pool (or 'magazine')."
3509,Shark Marius,"October 23, 2016",5,"Great replacement for the ""improved"" Apple News app!! When Apple first introduced News I was a huge fan. It allowed me to customize the feed so that The ONLY things I saw were items that related to my specified interest. The new version doesn't allow this. Although you can still select your interest, those news items now get buried in content I don't want like ""Breaking News"" and ""Top Stories"". For that reason I removed the app from my mobile devices. "
3510,Marclemagne,"July 21, 2010",3,"Needs some work I really like this app, and I think it really does a great job formatting Twitter and Facebook in a way that makes perhaps the mundane a little more interesting.  The layouts look great, and I love how it automatically processes and displays links and pictures so they appear in the stream."
3511,~MLACH~,"January 18, 2012",5,"Game Changer! I am absolutely crushing on Flipboard right now! Completely in love. This app brings together all of the top trending media from around the globe and gingerly places it right at your fingertips! I try to be an avid reader of news topics, technology, etc - but until now I had to wonder about multiple sites for a variety of opinions on what is ""certain outlets"" considered newsworthy.  Flipboard doesn't categorize content based on ad space bought or political bureaucracy, it simply gives you access to the top articles, stories, photos, information, trends, etc that the rest of the world finds relevant!"
3512,Ivan Fird,"February 1, 2012",5,Absolute must-have! Any iPad user must have this app. Its one of those apps that really makes a huge difference when you get to use it on a tablet. It's s intuitive and smart with the way it distributes news and other content. I love how it's always up to date with all the news stories. I have personally never experienced any sort of lag or crash from this app. 
3513,Fritz McAllenton,"March 11, 2012",4,"Great app but some bugs Overall, I love flipboard. Lets me quickly see things of interest to me, and the technology is really fun to use. Especially like the way that you literally flip pages up and down just like you're reading a newspaper (turned on its side). The downside is that many of the links require two or three transitions before you can read them in Safari with the reader feature. First you have to click on view on web then you have to click again on Reed in Safari. Finally you can click on reader. It would be nice if they had a single button to push that would convert the content to something more legible for those of us with aging eyes."
3514,ihartemis,"April 15, 2012",4,"Wonderful visual reader I love this apps beautiful interface - it is so seamless and easy to use! Everything works great and it is easy to add new news sources. Integration w social media, readitlater, and google reader are huge pluses. "

But my only complaints are when I want to include someone in a tweet, I don't automatically pull up the names when I start typing (PLEASE FIX). I follow a lot of people & I don't remember every single twitter handle by heart. Second thing the drop down menu for each account page to where if it's twitter you can pull it up by mentions, lists, favorites, etc... I would like to be able to pick which one of those options show up in the cover story feed & the feed view displays. My Google+ account only shows posts I made, I would like to display a circle or the what's hot section. Other than those things the app is great. Fix & I'll give 6 stars."
3517,Jojopo90,"December 7, 2012",4,Love love. But please. Please!!! I love this app it really cool I will give you 4 stars almost five cuz I wish only one thing will Chang. I wish the the app would change the pages color to what they should be like make Facebooks background the blue color cuz the white is to much for my eyes and completely dead and boring like Instagram make the background black with white letters. It's smoother and softer on the eyes. Twitter can just be black also. I know I'm just one guy saying this. But I really love this app prob only the first app Iv every downloaded and liked so much. If you could make this change I would love it so much more. Please take this into consideration and see what you creators can do about it. Thank you for you time.

Seriously, to the flipboard dev team, top notch job. You guys really made my favorite app perfect again. It's been feeling slow and clunky lately but no more. I can't wait to try more of it.

3522,ericandi,"November 2, 2011",3,"Crash, crash, crash Loved this app but it has gone down hill since IOS5. The app is virtually unusable because it crashes every few minutes. Usually happens when clicking to view original article or imbedded slide shows or videos. So frustrating because every time it crashes, I lose my place in the app and take forever to get back to the article that I was reading, only to have it crash again. The latest update didn't do anything o fix the crashing issue. Also having issues with the navigation by touchscreen not working well. Delays, freezes, and slow movement when dragging and moving around within the app. Please fix for real. Love the app, but I have been using other news apps that aren't crashing."

3525,Pirate!Argh!,"June 15, 2013",5,Great way to read curated content! Everyone has their favorite RSS readers and their favorite sites. I think what's make flipboard great is the curated content or magazines that other users make. They can vary from (very) specific topics to broad ones. And the articles come from a multitude of websites you probably don't have time or space to add on your own feed.
3526,Briscogun,"June 30, 2013",5,"Love the idea, just doesn't work UPDATE:"
3527,cbkosc,"July 25, 2015",4,Good app with one drawback I’ve been using Flipboard since it was released and it is a good app. The one drawback which has me looking for an alternative is that Flipboard does not automatically download the latest posting from feeds I subscribe to. Sometimes it is 24-48 hrs. Support said it is normal and they look for new posts based on how often new posts are made on each site. This does not work for me because I have sites where I need the information as soon as it is released. For this reason I have to subscribe individually to certain sites. Hopefully they will see this as a drawback and make the updates immediate. If not then I will eventually switch to something else.
3528,Dano in DSM,"January 20, 2016",4,"Very good. Use it daily. I like being able to flip through quickly. It's a gratifying experience and feels very readable. I enjoy reading this way much, much more than a scrolling screen."

I like to keep my magazines up to date, and if i integrate an article or dont need it anymore, I want to be able to erase it easily, or if i find two articles that connect, i want to be able to reorder them next to each other. I think this needs an edit mode for magazines with a layout that lets u get a bird's eye view of all articles, concise(d) to show only key info as small squares per article. each squared box enabled for erasing, reordering, etc. Thanks!"

3532,Guitar Son,"May 10, 2011",5,"10 out 10 Flipboard is a perfect 10, the 5 stars just do not do it justice. The layout and display is far beyond any other application available, plus when you add in all your social networks are at your fingertips makes Flipboard that much more amazing. Twitter has never looked better and displaying pictures, websites and stories without having click a link is mind boggling. You can even customize Flipboard to put your favorites on the Front Page so every time you open Flipboard Oprah, ESPN, HD photos or any number of sites is there to greet you and welcome you to your Flipboard voyage. You won't be disappointed with this app."

Why did ya'll move the star in google reader toolbar to the bottom of the page. This has made reading blogs so painfully slow, because each time I accidentally swipe the next item arrow, the page closes, whether I was finished reading, or simply trying to scroll. Its nerve wracking and annoying waiting for the page that JUST closed, to reload, never mind finding exactly where you left off, all while trying no to close out again by accident. Please move te toolbar back to the top of the page."
3534,Feed junkie,"March 3, 2012",5,Needs Article Caching and Font sizes I like flipboard on the iPad and was excited to see iPhone version. However after the new feel wore off I notice some issues.
3535,ShoobyTaylor,"June 19, 2012",2,"THIS is what people are so excited about? I can't see any advantage to using this over checking my social, RSS, and news media sites separately, and one serious disadvantage: this has no list view, no way to get an overview, you must swipe after every single post to see the next one. No unread count, no way to know how long you'll be swiping forward for, to way to skip ahead more than one at a time... yuck! This still breaks every service into its own ""section"" anyway, so I'll just stuck with separate apps that let me glance down my newsfeed or list of articles and let me see what's going on without having to swipe 35 times."

3537,Betta blue,"June 14, 2013",5,"Nice way to keep up on items of interest I love the interface and the way it behaves like a true magazine. I also enjoy the ability to save items of interest to your own board.  A suggestion for improvement would be the ability to clear items you have read.  I never know if I've seen everything and there is no quick way to see if there are recent posts in all your subscriptions - you have to open and read each subscription.  The cover stories I don't think catch all the new stories, just a sampling. If this was done, I would definitely give it 5 stars!"

Great graphics and a fantastic selection of Following Subjects... Well Done!
3539,MtsBeyondMts,"April 15, 2015",2,"Not nearly as good as Zite It's been over a year since Flipboard acquired Zite, yet it is still not as good as that app. I have tried a number of times to use Flipboard, but I never find it to be a useful app. Most importantly, the articles that appear are not as relevant as the ones Zite displays for me. In addition, the interface requires too many gestures. I just want to read. But I could deal with this annoyance if the content were as good as that on Zite. "
3540,TeGraJax,"July 28, 2010",5,"Flipboard = news/social media awesomeness!!! Finally a news/social media app that appears to be made for the ipad.  There is no need for scrolling up and down the screen constantly to see all the headlines; you just flip the page.  This feels very natural.  No need, as with Safari, to magnify certain parts of the text to make them easier to read.  Also, it is easy to set up the information you want on the contents page, ie news/sports/technology/etc.  The facebook portion is good for a quick look at what is being posted, including pictures.  Hopefully this is the start of great things to come."

The magazine format is crisp and clean and it is fun to see photos from my friends and family displayed so beautifully. I also like that I am able to pick from other news sources, although I have notice the choices are limited.  Once I choose my sources I can easily arrange them on my Flipboard content page just by moving them around like I do my icons on my iPad screen.  The only thing I would add is the ability to save photos to my camera roll and more news feed options."

But hopping from one site to another to read stories of interest can be annoying especially when you are short on time.  Flipboard covers so many different news and information topics you have it all with a flip of the page.  If its health news, which is of great interest to me, or world news..you will find it here.  HEY...even your Facebook and twitter posts from your connections are there if you want them to.  If sharing content is something you do, you have that to.  Very well designed, easy to use.  I love it"
3543,justtheJAKEster,"March 24, 2012",5,"You really just have to try it... ...to understand why Flipboard gets a perfect rating. I've long used Google Reader to keep up with my news- from aggregators and generalized news sites to the niche blogs catering to my own neuroses and interests. I never cared about site redesigns and splash pages- just give me the information. So I was late to the Flipboard party, but now that Im here the thought of scrolling through endless feeds in Reader makes my head hurt. Amazing app, and my advice would be to spend time adding your own accounts and curating your boards from what others have posted. A must have for anyone using iOS."

I do however agree with many of the people that have stated that the update makes it harder to simply read about a given category. With the introduction of very specific categories in the last update, some of which are helpful even though they are suggested far too often, there very badly needs to be be a way to organize them in a more general category. I used to follow maybe 15 topics which were easily navigable. Now, I follow at least twice that number and it takes forever just to scroll around and find what I want. Please add a way to organize these!"

3548,SoperrepoS,"March 2, 2016",2,"Good App, But Dubious Content & Ads This app is wildly inconsistent in terms of content and presentation.  I am constantly removing Topics and providers due to low quality content or outright unwanted/inappropriate content.  Flipboard often defaults to a poor browser style display for some articles loaded with ads, pop-ups, autoplay animations and auto opening the App Store to hawk junk games.  Presentation should be consistent across all content!  Articles are often recycled repeatedly or duplicated with similar stories.  New updates to this app hide Instapaper and Evernote under multiple clicks.  The flipping is still a very satisfying way to consume content, but the content itself is in need of some serious curation.  Apple News is going to obliterate this app if the developers don't get it together!"
3549,WebGirl!,"January 11, 2017",5,"Love the app! But.. This app is amazing !! it allows me to easily flip through articles quickly with the flip functionality which is great :-) Would love it even more if Flipboard would automatically open every single time. At the moment every time I want to read an article it asks me if ""I want to open Flipboard"" and this should be a simple fix for the developers I would think. If the user says yes, simply retain that setting. I hope you add the feature soon. I did turn the setting on so that it would auto open within the app but that does not seem to do the trick thanks for a great tool!"

I can't access the majority of my bookmarked pages because I can only have 4 pages worth of tiles on the iPhone.  I don't see how the iPhone version of this app can possibly be a suitable replacement for peoples' Google Reader feeds when you can only access 19 sites."
3551,fabriceflorin,"August 18, 2014",5,"Indispensable I use Flipboard several times a day to keep up with the news from my social networks. It's a great app and I get a lot out if it. My main complaint is that the content can get stale after my first daily visit: I would expect it to be fresh all the time, just like Twitter. Also, when I try to share content from Flipboard, it converts all URLs to its own domain shortcuts, which causes Facebook to replace the original story thumbnails to a generic Flipboard icon.  So I have to cut and  paste the contents and share them through Twitter instead.  I wouldn't have to do this if it didn't force it's own URL shortener on me."

I had tried Flipboard in the past but liked Zite better so I settled on that. As a tech leader and appreciator of good App design I feel (but don't know for certain) that Flipboard is designed by committee and has fallen victim to a ""Google like"" design evolution in that the team sits around the table and proclaims ""everyone loves Flipboard! We are tops in News aggregator Apps. Let's change everything"".  Then set off to make the UX and UI over designed to have it function outside of what iPhone and iPad users are accustomed to using - just to impress their friends. ""We are Flipboard, we are different."" My suggestion is - pick up the UX and UI of Zite and apply the Flipboard algorithms (if you must) and relaunch it for the Zite users which will migrate away from Flipboard to other Apps."

This is the first thing I check whenever I pick up my iPad and believe me, I pick it up a lot.  I fell in love with Flipboard when I got my original iPad 1.  I can change my sources, I can look up new ones, it covers everything I'm interested in.  And their service techs are friendly, prompt and always ready with an answer.  I would highly recommend this to everyone and I do.  I'm always commenting about reading a story on ""Flipboard"".  Keep up the great work.  You and I will be friends for a long, long time."

I'm someone who doesn't read many books, but I get the same information from articles, quickly and efficiently so I don't waste time reading books filled with fluff. Somehow Flipboard knows what I need to read when I need to read it and it's almost like a horoscope feeling to me. I've never written a review before, but I had to for this app. I'm an entrepreneur and the design of this app is very inspiring to me and I wish there were more like it. Thank you Flipboard, keep up the good work."
3556,The Savagery,"February 13, 2016",1,"Zite was better This app has/had potential but is pretty seriously flawed. Full of ads, links to articles you've got to view in Safari to read anyway, you're still subject to the popups and aggressive advertising the articles host without any benefit of a filter or add blocker and finally, most fatally, an algorithm that is just.. off. I entered my list of interests when starting with the app and made the mistake of clicking on an article about the purchase of the Wu Tang Clan album for 2 million. From this point forward, my feed was inundated with hip hop news, album releases, studio status, minor tiffs on Twitter between hip hop stars, ad infinitum . No matter what I tried to tell the app I didn't want to read about hip hop, it found other stuff to throw at me. Couldn't take it anymore today and deleted it. Tried to make it work but this app is garbage."

The news stories added to my magazine (which has been on Flipboard for quite some time) never get added to the Flipboard main magazines such as World News or the country magazine they are about. If I add new stories I used to get credit for it, but now my magazine is cut off from all others and my magazine name is never put up on the top banner where people get credit and their magazine mentioned by name, and so few people now see my magazine. Been a constant issue for me for 2 weeks now. When I contact Flipboard they took a week to answer and only with a very brief reply saying it may be a bug or a policy change. ???  Which is no answer at all. Why bother with them. It's a waste of time."

Unfortunately most apps can't provide any of those. All I did was playing with them for a bit and got tired of those and... deleted them. Luckily there's flipboard!!! It's cool, fun, and having all the info I want, plus when I want to share the news with my friends, just a simple tap and I am like coolest nerd ever! Yay! Kudos to u guys!"

I'm a busy dad of 4, adult student at Penn State, and part time worker so catching up on the news was never easy, until this gem came along. Fast, easy, intuitive, comprehensive, fun, brilliant, well written, great links, I know, I know, I'm really buttering the bread here, but to top it off with one more praise, the best keeps getting better. They take suggestions to heart and continue to upgrade the site to make it better and better which makes this a 6 star app in my book."

Everything now is in one place so you don't need to switch between different applications. You can even share news and reply to posts within the app itself. Fully integrated with 'pocket' app so you can save stories to read later. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! Download it and enjoy!"

I liked it so much that I decided I wanted it, and I didn't care how much it cost. This app instantly became my most used app. My Twitter timeline has never looked so good and easy to use. I didn't get on Twitter much for that reason; I didn't like how you had to interact with it. But now? Problem solved. Great for current news and other such items like sports, with a very surprisingly good Gaming section. If you're trying to keep up with current events despite your fast paced life, this is the app for you."

It allows me to quickly flip through news articles, and read just the ones I'm interested in.  Furthermore, it allows me to select what type of articles I want displayed, for example I like tech articles, but not sports articles, so I can specify that only tech articles and not sports articles be displayed.  Great app!  However, a search feature is needed.  It APPEARS to have a search feature, BUT IT DOES NOT work well.  I typed in ""computers apple"" and an iPhone article comes up ... what???"

I have been a using the app on my iPhone and Win 10 notebook for several weeks. I find the interface to be bad and hard to use. I see an article on the front tile and I click it so I can read it.  Instead of showing the article, I get dropped into a clutter of tiles with absolutely no way of knowing which tile the story is hidden within. Moving around but through articles is very inefficient as I have to navigate back from any path I follow instead of just popping back to the top.  "

Although when I watch videos it crashes almost every time. And when I enlarge the video, the crashing possibility increases a great deal. Making it almost useless to enlarge the videos. Also, I don't know exactly where they get there news feeds from, but most of them seem to be in horrible quality. Making the HD screen on an iPad rather pointless. If the crashes stop, and the videos are more high def with faster results, then this would be the perfect app. You guys got an A+ for quantity, but a C- for quality. After this is all fixed, then definitely,... An A++ in my book, with a happy face, lol."

If you are big into face book and twitter which most of you are then I think this might work better for you. To me I am liking the way my other above mentioned news readers feel and work so I am going to stick with them. Might try flip board again later just now I couldn't seem to set it up the way I felt worked best for me to give me the things I like to read about.

I get that it needs to be there because there is no actual cover for the iPhone version, but why do we need a cover story section if it just covers sections that are already in the other categories that we are going to look at or read anyway?

Navigating to edit my personal flipboard was confusing at first. Now its just annoying to navigate through multiple pages to get there. Also, there is no way to send articles via text to others through flipboard-which is a major down side. There is no way to eliminate articles once viewed. There is no way to manage the individual flipboard groups (I.e. I have three photo categories yet can't combine them into one). Overall, flipboard is worth having.

I still use Pulse, where I need to read about Internet marketing and search engine optimization and web design. Pulse lets you customize more closely any topic you want to read about. But I still use Flipboard for all the things that it does offer which are really great."

We've given you tons of things that you need to address to make this the next killer app. The fact that there are no updates since JULY says that you guys are lazy and/or unqualified. Such a shame something that was so promising is going to disappear due to mismanagement and incompetence. Fix what's wrong with the iPad version (especially adding more sources), create an iPhone version, and keep your app from disappearing into the files of the thousands of apps that no one gives a $#!T about. I've said it before and I'll say it again, if it's money you want, I'd pay for you to FIX THIS APP instead of the lazy attitude that is sitting around at this point.

It's as if all these sources of news are the reporters and FlipBoard is the editor and layout manager.  Truly ingenious.  Highly recommended for info junkies (like me).

I would also like better visibility for my comments on articles or pics I post. I sometimes have to use my laptop for research before I post an article to my mag because Flipboard is finicky about multi-tasking. If I switch to another app, when I get back it's a crap shoot whether Flipboard will return me to my place or start me afresh on the home page. When I'm translating an article and need to search a word, I often lose my place. All the above would be welcome fixes."

Having a relative in the journalism industry, I know that the whole ad-support-as-the-only-source-of-revenue model is killing the news industry. Journalists don't make enough money for news to be free. I haven't found a way to tag certain sources as ones I want to see and others as ones I don't. I'm tired of seeing ads.

Sometimes I click through to a providers' website that has lots of annoying ads but that's unusual, most of them are pretty well-behaved. Easy to navigate, very nice format with lots of options to let you find the kind of stories you are interested in and avoid those that don't interest you.

However, for those of us who like to pay attention to a really, really, really high volume of information, Flipboard can't put all that information into a single stream. Instead, users need to choose a category of information to read. I don't want to go through my 150+ categories. I want to read it all at once, starting with most recent, noteworthy, and popularly read, then have the option to choose a category from there. Flipboard is not yet an app for the well-rounded because it lacks a method of putting everything in the same place."

It's been an essential app for me, but I must say you get what you put into it. Meaning taking time to choose topics relevant to you. Yes, some articles load better than others, and some get cut off after the first few lines. But if you are interested enough, you are only a click away from the original article. It's not without its quirks, but if you take the time to personalize it, you will be rewarded with a very readable, informative news app."

SmartNews was nice because it had a text only option so it would open articles MUCH faster (the lack of this option on flipboard is my only reason for the 4 stars) but the content on smart news wasn't as good. I love being able to pick my own topics and sources on flipboard and the interface is much more appealing than other apps I've used in the past. If they made a way to view text only articles so I can access them with a poor phone connection, it'd be a 5 star review hands down."

Hopefully I'm not just missing some obvious way to refresh inside the app... I'm also having an issue when trying to add a person or list from Twitter as it tells me to check my Internet connection (which is fine). Hopefully that's something that will clear up.

As of now, it's been over 12 hours since I last checked it, and the content in both Facebook and Twitter is roughly the same as it was before. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to what content is shown, either. There's no way to read an entire article without viewing it on the web. No in app refresh. Pictures are low quality.

You can even read more stories from the source, and when you are done you can go right back to Flipboard where you left off. News is updated frequently. This meets all my needs and it's free.

Reading a page and not touching the iPad ... Crash. Start Flipboard and select the ""mag"" I want to read ... Crash. Very difficult to keep running long enough to read an article but I keep trying.

It's not unusable, but it's become frustrating to work with.

After 3 total pages of flip-able topics,  I need to transition to a completely different page that has my remaining topics on a list.  At this point I need to transition to scrolling down to those topics, clicking on them and then reading them.  It seems a pit nitpicky,  but why build in an inability to flip on an app called Flipboard?

I am also getting a crap ton of sports and meat articles which I have never viewed, liked, or subscribed to.  I even used the controls to say never show me articles like this, and I also clicked on what looked like useful keyword tags that I didn't want to see articles on, but after restarting the app I still get the same and similar articles.

You choose what you care to pay attention to. And you don't have to worry about a SINGLE groups bias. You get a bunch of different articles from all over, getting different facts from different viewpoints. One thing I didn't like us that sometimes it shows edited old articles, meaning it is old news, but it isn't very often, and isn't a big problem. One of the very few apps I would ever rate 5 stars."

If you tried it on a iphone6/6+ rather than Xcode you would recognize that you can't tap it with your finger. Which of course you could in the previous ver. I don't want to hate it but I do.

After using it for several weeks I find the navigation a bit laborious - it would be nice to have a summary view of each topic rather than having to flip through the articles. Also I find myself accidentally tapping an article instead of flipping and it opens up the web view, which can often be slow to render - and not formatted well for viewing on an iPhone. I prefer the lighter more quick loading views in Smartnews and News Republic. Finally, the flip feature is cool to start with but gets a bit tiresome when reading longer articles."

Now that Zite has officially closed down and even though Zite's algorithms have been incorporated into Flipboard, it's not the same. I find I am using Flipboard less and less and using other news gathers more. Why is this? Flipboard doesn't really show me things I am interested in. It seems to want to show me things their sponsors are interested in. So as the lights go out on Zite I will be deleting Flipboard from my iPad, iPhone and bookmarks.

I echo the sentiments of all the long time users of Flipboard disappointment with version 4.0. It was a polished and usable experience that has been split into two and lacks much of the efficiencies of previous versions. Dead ends and sometimes unrelated suggested stories make this and experience I can't enjoy. I would rather visit each site individually rather than consume it in Flipboard. This app made me love reading on my phone and now it's the least pleasurable form of news consumption. Good luck to you as you continue this development. I will look elsewhere for now.

I do enjoy the content that is provide although I must say one downside is the content gets repeated fairly often when you flip through you begin to notice the same photos along with articles about the same subject just written slightly different as the newest ones are updates on the same subject but how often can you read the same thing 3-4 times

It seems to insist on having images in all the stories cutting out the text and making me flip through more pages to see the same number of topics. I find myself consistently activating portions of the interface without trying and interrupting my flow. Zite is just so much better at being seamless an staying out of my way.  Keep Zite or lose me.

It's a great way to quickly scroll through a large number of posts, while getting just enough information to see if you want to read the entire post or not. It is easy to navigate through the user interface to see all posts, or to drill down to a specific information source."
3655,Jejily1,"January 30, 2012",4,"Slow to update For the most part, I love this app. Great way to preview my favorite social media sites, blogs, and news sites... er, *when* they update, that is. Hitting the ""refresh"" button doesn't always work. Major news sites I've loaded on my Flipboard still have articles from yesterday listed as the ""latest"" top news. Not sure why the app isn't updating the feed. Social media sites are a little more likely to be up-to-date when I hit refresh... but even then, there can sometimes be a lag of minutes or even hours. Fix this issue, and this would definitely be a 5-star app."
3656,Mrs Vodalus,"March 23, 2012",1,"Disappointingly superficial:  Following up on links is a PITA I've just deleted the app after 3 weeks of use.  It just doesn't meet my needs as someone who likes to read complete articles and then investigate cross-linked content.  There's no Google Reader support for the ""read on the web"" window.  You can't highlight to copy any text in Flipboard, much less hold a hyperlink to copy the URL.  Several of the internally supported news sites don't publish the entire article on Flipboard, forcing me to open up the parent site in Safari anyways."
3657,Kifolinorad,"April 8, 2012",5,Easily in my Top 5 This app is quite easily one of the five apps that  I use the most. It's simple and customizable layout enables me to see what I want and quickly skip over things that I do not find interesting. It uses a large array of news sources so there is always something new for me to read.
3658,Evernote is amazing,"September 27, 2016",5,I love Flipboard Flipboard is one of my favorite apps. I enjoy how I can 'train' Flipboard to gather news from sources all over the world. These stories provide insight and perspective which are lacking on many cable news shows. Being able to concentrate on multiple areas of interest and not just hear the same 3-4 stories all day is exciting. You can 'follow' other people and their magazines and start reviewing and adding news sources you might not have known before. If anything I would like Flipboard to show even more stories. Amazing app.
3659,Cwps,"February 28, 2017",1,"Was my Favorite--until this update After receiving an email touting its new smart magazine, I thought Flipboard was going to be even better. During the last month or so, I have noticed that many articles containing video were very slow to load. I was hoping the update would remedy this problem, but it has made it only worse! After updating, many photos in news articles have completely dropped out and articles containing video don't load at all on my iPad Pro over my turbo internet connection. My question to developers is this: Why release an update or new feature that completely torpedoes an app that had issues and was losing users in the first place? Don't release updates until they are thoroughly tested on every platform."
3660,Grmlk,"August 1, 2010",5,"Very Nice! When I first d/l the app I had to wait for my facebook and twitter account to work on it.  It took about a week before I received an email saying I was good to go which was sooner than I thought it would take.  All I can say is, it was worth the wait.  This thing works amazing.  My FB and Tweets never looked this good."
3661,-shrug-,"August 5, 2010",5,"Great Reader I've gotta say, I don't know why you'd be mad about waiting for Facebook or Twitter on this thing. It takes about a day, the thing's free, and you know what? The other articles are amazing. I love the feeds that are included, and when Facebook and Twitter becomes accessible, it makes browsing photos a TON easier. Also, I've found a few really thought provoking articles through this app. If there's really something that could be improved, I just wish that the Facebook feed would include more recent posts the old posts."
3662,Jay.Tizzle,"June 20, 2011",5,"Awesome app, but... This has got to be one of the best social networking apps out for the iPad, if not THE best.  It'd be nice, however, to see LinkedIn added to the mix, push notifications and a badge.  The way the info is displayed, you don't know who's commented on what, etc. so I have to rely on my iPhone's Facebook notifications when in fact, I have little desire to even use the Facebook app on my phone now that I have Flipboard.  Nonetheless, no criticism from me, though I do wonder how they make money when there are no annoying ads in the app (that's awesome too, though!)."
3663,BarefootTek,"December 12, 2011",4,"😁Happy now that I can connect Loved it on iPad. Loving it so far. Not very user friendly for a new user but luckily I figured it all out and after that it's cake and just took time to get used to it. I like this better than the fb app as I hated it so much I just used the browser and only used it for photo/video uploads. Love that this app does a lot and works well. One suggestion I would make is being able to tag or share either in comments or photos for fb, notifications, private messages and friend requests. If it has all the functions of fb then it could be a top app. Needs some work still."
3664,grantsisneros,"May 7, 2012",5,"The best of the best! This is my favorite app. I have seen so many others try to make something similar or keep trying to keep up with Flipboard. But to no avail. What i see are a bunch of popular apps trying to keep up, ""not going to happen.""  Unless of course, they try a little harder then the wana be,crap,out there. I would say, if there were to be any improvements with ,Flipboard it would have to be integrating all of the categories into one big clipboard, instead of going from category to category, that's really my only complaint."
3665,sharon_kay11,"December 13, 2012",2,"Wishing I want to love Flipboard, but it has one horrible flaw that kills my information cycle.  It doesn't support bookmarking services.  I'm a college professor, and bookmarking is important to me and to my students.  On a desktop computer when I read an article that could benefit my students I'll tag it in Delicious using unique keywords for each of my classes.  I can later search by keyword for one article, or even publish all my Delicious links on specific topics into my Blackboard classroom.  My students even suggest links for me to tag.  Sadly, Flipboard won't play with Delicious or any other bookmarking service.  "
3666,CityK8,"February 3, 2013",4,"Additional pages I know the main portion of the app only has 4 pages but I read that you should be able to click on the red ribbon to show the additional pages I've added and they just aren't there... For example, on page 4 it has the ""show 4 more"" button, I click it and it just shows the main pages I added when I first got the app. None of the new pages I added today to be able to rearrange them or even see them. There's only 12 boards showing under ""your flipboard"" when I'm showing 19 on the 4 pages plus should have 4 more somewhere."
3667,mikaelDom,"October 30, 2014",4,"Great app overall but update needs improvement I run the app on the iPhone 6 plus. New version is clever and faster and the new topic feature is great. However, it seems like not taking full advantage of all of the space the iPhone 6 plus provides. Fonts are bigger than previous versions."
3668,ElvinOY,"October 14, 2015",4,"Please fix the in-app dictionary I love Flipboard and has been a user for five years ever since the app's launch in the App Store.  I have to say I am really impressed with the app's lead in social news feed niche market, and I am currently using the app's public magazine profile as my online representation.  That said, the latest version needs to fix the bug in iOS dictionary look-up function.  Whenever I tried to long press a word and look up the meaning in iOS dictionary, I see only this translucent box hanging below the article title.  Please please fix this bug and I will give my five stars back to the app"
3669,Doing_the_Loop,"May 15, 2017",2,"Flopboard is a flipping one trick pony I have really tried to like this app.  The flipping page may seem neat at first but it soon becomes annoying and cumbersome. It is not good at locating the news I want to see; it does not ""learn"" despite my input.  Flipboard is just not as accurate at finding my content as other news readers."
3670,SunflowerLand,"July 20, 2010",5,"Jobs must be happy to see this app This app fully utilizes the purposes & characteristics of iPad... It is an actual magazine size, its pages flip like real paper, its layout is similar to the layouts of real magazine. UI is so user-friendly that it almost feels like reading an offline magazine. At the same time, being an online magazine, its content is always fresh and new, and users can even create their own sub-magazines inside this app by adding their topics of interest. Big applauds to the idea. "
3671,lazyjmusic,"May 28, 2011",3,"Please add... A way to view/sort feeds from oldest unread article to newest. I'd love to be able to view and read my Google Reader feeds with the sources mixed into one group and run through them all from oldest to newest. So many of the blogs and news sources I subscribe to build upon themselves each day and it would be nice to read the articles in the order they were published. If a simple toggle to allow sources to be sorted from oldest to newest instead of newest to oldest, Flipboard would probably become one of my most used apps. "
3672,danjo13,"July 9, 2012",4,Great App This is a great app overall. It is beautifully made and handles content very nicely. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reader like this. I especially like the recent Google+ integration.
3673,JBHickok,"November 5, 2013",1,"Pointless, Useless and Stupid This is an example of stupidly creating technology for the sake of having technology.  You want to make available to me electronic versions of real magazines that cost around $6.00 per issue that I can't even hold in my hand but instead must view on a tiny phone screen?  No way!  Not even at NO charge."
3674,Metamorph3,"September 17, 2015",5,"Awesome news aggregator with unique interface I have been using Flipboard for a while now and still hooked to it. Great interface, amazing choice of content and lots of options to customize from choosing news sources to creating your own magazines for your own choice of news clips. Flip through the news as well as updates from you social network accounts. "
3675,Lolapants,"October 6, 2015",4,"Not quite Zite Although nice to navigate, the customization is still lacking. While Zite allows you to swipe up/down or click the thumb buttons to help hone your subscriptions, FB makes it feel as though I have to justify the reason for not wanting to see a certain article. I'm not a sports fan, yet I get articles about football and the only recourse is to either mute ""advertising"" or USA Today, or write a reason why I shouldn't have to read the article. It's just a nuisance. I'm hoping that if they do away with Zite (which would be a bummer) they do fully migrate the functionality over!"
3676,bsscheyer,"December 6, 2015",3,"I miss Zite already I migrated my preferences to Flipboard since it was suggested with the demise of the Zite app/service. While there are interesting articles that are in line with my preferences, navigations is lacking when compared with Zite. I cannot scroll through an article, I have to flip pages. There is no (at least I haven't found it) ""Top Stories"" feed to browse through. I have to choose the topic I want to read about before I see what articles are available."
3677,Disney U,"December 19, 2015",2,"Flawed....Heavily Flawed There are at least two major flaws with this app. First, it picks up wrong, and/or very old feeds.  E.G, one of of my selections is for the Grand Canyon.  I expect to get news about the national park.  Instead, I get the results from Grand Canyon college basketball games.  Another example is the feed about Nikon cameras. Flipboard is posting news from 2009 as current. The D90 is not a new camera. Nor is the D80. Both long gone. The second issue is the unnecessary flipping.  At most, I want to turn page once to get to the story. Not with this app. I have to flip and flip and flip and...If it puts up a slideshow, forget it. Flipping 15 times to read a story is asinine. I miss Zite...a lot. I am dumping Flipboard and going to News360 and  News."
3678,G Bear 75,"March 1, 2017",5,Highly recommend!!  It's what I've been needing in my life. This app is my number 1 go to app. Everything I follow and enjoy reading is here. The ease of flipping through the pages is so smooth. It's a one stop app for everything. I have now deleted all of the multiple apps I once used before as Flipboard covers it all. I tell it what I want to see and that's what it shows me. I will continue to recommend this app to all of my family and friends.  
3679,Algerarosso,"August 17, 2017",5,Always the game-changing app This is a great tool for obtaining news and valuable educational resources! Thank you Flipboard for your great work and providing such a fantastic app! 
3680,AlexanderYoungblood,"July 31, 2010",5,Amazing Looking for a review of the actual app and not just a complaint? Look here!
3681,jsx,"January 29, 2012",5,"What do I need this for?!? Oh. Downloaded this because I saw a glowing review of it somewhere on the web. I normally digest news my own way using my favorite sites, I didn't need no stinking aggregator! I figured it wouldn't hurt to look though. I was blown away!"
3682,Dougwastaken,"March 23, 2012",4,"Sleek Design & Great Integration What a neat app-- Flipboard has put a fresh spin on RSS Reading, and took into account what people read their news on: the touchscreen. "
3683,jorn!,"December 28, 2012",5,"The first app I open every day. Your iPad is naked without this! This is THE newsreader. I try others, but keep coming back to Flipbook. In fact, get it just for the Twitter capabilities alone, if that's all you want. Once set up, this is the 21st century version of your morning paper; enjoy it with your coffee and eggs."
3684,Eko8,"August 25, 2013",3,Pretty UI but user experience is still lacking It really needs to have indications of when an article has been read and when a feed has no new items in it. Especially now that google reader is defunct this feature is missing from the entire app.
3685,KosmicTom,"August 17, 2014",5,"An Incredible App This app singlehandedly convinced me to get an iPad, and I use it on my iPhone as well. Remaking websites into simulated magazine pages seems gimmicky until you try it, and then you realize there's no better way to read the web. It's addictive to use and customize, and the layouts and page-flipping effects are beautifully designed. Not all webpages are compatible yet, but most are, and I imagine this will improve over time. This is one app definitely worth trying out for smartphones, and if you own a tablet, it's essential."
3686,ibrice.cook,"November 3, 2014",5,"iOS 8 inspired Once again, iOS 8 has inspired developers to downgrade their apps. Making interfaces less intuitive seems to be trending in the tech world. I'm not some grumpy old guy who refuses to upgrade from Windows XP; I'm simply someone who doesn't understand changing something for the sake of change. So many other developers have ruined their apps by making poor changes to what had been a beautiful and functional system...why follow in their footsteps instead of continuing to set the trend with your previously high standards?"
3687,f4jock,"November 7, 2014",1,"Concentrate on giving us updated news quickly Not happy with version 3 at all. I look at News, Technology, etc., many times a day. I don't like having to page through 3 or 4 pages of mostly static ""Top Stories"" for all these sections every time I open them! I want to see the newly added news immediately. I want the new news! Additionally, the pictures for these tiles no longer seems to change as the news inside the tiles change. It was nice to see a picture preview of the newest story before opening up the tile...but no more. Is this just a bug? Hope so. Do the makers of Flipboard actually use it for news, or are they just interested in magazines, which I don't even use? Please concentrate on giving us the news please."
3688,Blendieofindie,"March 2, 2016",4,Great UI The only improvements I can suggest is to offline browsing.  Flip board does a great job downloading the headlines for offline browsing.  What's missing is the content.  This is what matters most when I'm on my morning Bart commute.
3689,BuckyNite,"June 16, 2016",5,"Great way to share news I've made a magazine for my husband and it's a great way to share news I think he'd like (and vice versa).  I don't need to tweet or fbook everything so the whole world can see, just a great way to share news so we can read at our leisure and discuss.  Sounds like some of the other reviews don't understand how to use and customize the format - I've never had any issues - and if a magazine stops being interesting there are plenty more to choose from. Fantastic in all ways; my only news source!"

I definitely didn't know i would want to see my social networking displayed in such a different way. The UI and everything about this app has a very fresh air about it. It's a perfect fit for one of my favorite parts of the iPad, where I'm sitting back enjoying content with nothin more than a flick of a finger."
3691,omgvua,"July 6, 2011",5,Best of 9 news apps I have I must confess.  I'm a news junkie.  I've got apps for all the major sites and publications except for a few I find too full of propaganda.  
3692,Chadwick103,"August 5, 2011",4,"Great app! But need font enlarging option. One of the best for reading - whatever you like to read from the Internet. I use it for news feeds, Facebook, twitter, and google reader. For me, it basically replaces each of these. "

Imagine your entire social network, everything anyone you've ever known has ever posted on any networking site that they have a profile on at your fingertips... Almost sounds too good to be true, but somehow this app pulls it off in the most perfect way. I can scan thousands of articles, pictures, posts, and updates over the course of minutes without ever closing an app. This is by far the most worthwhile app to download for the curious, in-touch, and interested social networker. If I could give it 6 stars I would. Amazing!"
3694,itinko,"December 25, 2011",5,"Phenomenal but crashes I love FlipBoard, it's the only reason I still use my iPad (I use Galaxy Tab 10.1 for everything else). The only problem is it crashes at least once, sometimes more often, when I sit down to use it. And of course there's no way to resume where it left off. I now have iOS 5 but it was crashing before that, I think it's a bug introduced in one of the more recent releases since it worked great when I first got it. From what I hear the instability only applies to original iPad. Hope they fix this!"
3695,JockoPablo,"January 14, 2012",5,"Not just for social networks Frequently is one of the most frequently recommended apps for the iPad, but every time someone mentions Flipboard it seems like they focus on using it with Twitter.

3696,websuccess,"April 9, 2016",5,"In my opinion, Flipboard is the future of marketing I have been using Flipboard ever day since 2013. I use it for everything from reading the latest news to creating marketing brochures and catalog magazines. Flipboard has offered me a hobby as well a professional opportunity both for me and for the agency I work for. It is visual, appealing and easy to use. I look forward to the updates. I do however feel that the analytics need to be a little more specific to entice future marketers to advertise on the platform."
3697,Abbygale414,"September 18, 2016",4,"Quick and easy news and info I really like this app. It allows you to choose a variety of topics you are interested in, and then gives you a collection of succinct info packages around those topics.

3698,Mg22519,"October 7, 2016",4,"Great way to organize, but not perfect I really love using this app. It's great to organize the topics that I'm most interested in and gives me an opportunity to track certain topics over time. However, I wish it was slightly more intuitive to use and wouldn't show me as much ""junk"". Maybe it's on my end and I need to mark stories that I don't want to see, but either way sometimes I have to dig to find relevant content. Nevertheless, I really like this app and the function that it provides that, up to this point, I haven't found anything else that manages articles as well."
3699,Njjtriyingtosleep,"November 22, 2016",4,"Pretty good User for three years. I never minded the adds too much when I read the old paper versions of the New York Times or a good magazine. So for this app doesn't seem to have too many. Maybe I am lucky ....I am not getting pop-ups but I occasional add every four pages or so.... and I glance at those but don't dwell on them so, I'm still not sure why they are bothering people. I do have to be careful on the ones labeled promoted. Also New York Times portion of this app limits me to 10 articles per month. Seems like they could take down the pay wall and throw more ads at me. I wouldn't mind."
3700,Kim-42,"June 19, 2011",4,"Clipboard is useful, but Flipboard is very, very useful for getting at the information you want or need, provided that information comes from the sources you have identified in advance.  Unfortunately, very useful information can be missed because you don't know about the source.  A further small, but significant problem is that you get all the information produced by a selected source.  Sometimes, I want to follow a source, but only for certain topics, not for everything they might produce.  "
3701,Kyle Livingston,"August 30, 2011",4,"Amazing go-to app! As a US Peace Corps. Volunteer in Thailand, I use FlipBoard as my go-to app for daily news updates, technological reviews and travel advice (amongst many others). I absolutely love being able to access almost everything from one app."
3702,Nichitsuki,"December 7, 2011",5,"Great Media Hub The moment I got connected with this app, I knew I was in love with it. The interface is so fluid that it makes it seem to have the grace of an Apple app. Being able to pull from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and many other services, it makes it like a constantly published magazine. You can search for things you like and it will pull up many related streams you can pull from. This is my favorite app now. Just loving it. Would appreciate landscape support and I would also like to put it in Notification Center."
3703,HanSolo52,"May 1, 2012",5,"The gold standard of news delivery in the digital age This app defines how information can and should be delivered in the digital age.  In no other app have I been able to traverse multitudes of news and information in a few ""flips"".  Most other news apps are essentially taking traditional hardcopy material and turning them into readable PDFs.  Flipboard presents information in an intuitive and organic manner that engages the reader to explore and discover what is happening in the world.   I hope that more and more information delivery apps take notice.   Bravo, Flipboard."
3704,JT_USC,"July 17, 2013",4,"Love it, but... The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is a couple minor things. Would love to see the full title of the article in the preview tile. Often I find myself opening an article simply to see the full title to decide if I'm interested. Also, I might also suggest the total number of pages be visible on the preview tile. Finally, and this may be outside of Flipboard's control, I don't like the articles that come through partially with the ""Continue Reading"" button (i.e. Mashable). My hope is that all future articles are self-contained within Flipboard (i.e. Huffington Post). That is all."

So I'm confused is it that the cover automatically changes with the latest post or is the app confused because of my second magazine.

I've got dozens of accounts across the internet, and I don't need another one to keep track of, especially because I don't want to integrate Facebook, Twitter, or sync my magazines across devices. As far as I can tell, it offers me nothing except more spam (sorry--""targeted advertising"") on top of the ads the app already serves up. I'm probably alone in taking this stand, but this crap really bugs me. I'd rather just be charged outright than put up with this stuff. Gonna take Feedly out for a spin in the meanwhile."

I love Flipboard for finding news I might otherwise miss, but I wish it was a more stable app.  I have a 1st generation ipad, and Flipboard constantly crashes. Further, this problem has gotten worse with each update, to where it will crash after reading just a couple of articles, and sometimes on just the first. I've followed the suggestions Flipboard suggests, which is basically just to reboot the device, but that solved nothing.  I've tried contacting Flipboard a couple of time, haven't got a response.

I've checked it daily and used it as a great source of all sorts of info. However, when the app made its most recent major update it changed the 'home screen' so that now you can only see one article as opposed to beforehand when you could see the first article of your top 4 favorite categories. Other than that, it's a good and useful app. I hope that there is either a way to change it or that they make some adjustments"
3718,Bulwyf,"February 12, 2016",1,"Horrible What was once an amazing news app has just gone down hill. Articles I can only read 2 pages of before they want me to pay for it(some sources not all), just remove those sources. ""Promoted"" articles, something I cannot believe even exist, are non sense. I mean if you have to repost your old articles to get attention, you're doing something wrong.  Along with repeats of the same articles listed more than once, I've seen the same article by the same source appear 3 ""flips"" apart from each other. This use to be one of the best new apps for mostly reading news, as opposed to videos. Once a very promising app is uninstalled and shall stay this way. From my experience once a news app starts down this path, it doesn't get better."
3719,SnADad,"January 18, 2017",5,Just about perfect More than just a good iOS app it is the ultimate implementation of usable technology. You can easily configure the content that you see. If the pages to which you are directed are wrought with ads and distractions you can redirect the content to Safari to use reading mode to eliminate the chaff. Forwarding content is just a button press away and always works. I will say that the Windows app failed miserably the last time I tried it. Flipboard was a weighty factor in my decision to move from a Surface 3 tablet back to iOS.
3720,l_powell,"July 22, 2010",5,"May be the iPad's killer app I was lucky enough to get the Twitter and Facebook connections working last night, and it is already one of my favorite apps.  The style and presentation are fantastic, and it is easy to find all sorts of interesting content."
3721,tvvidmaster,"April 28, 2011",5,"One if the Best apps I have had an iPad now for 48 hours and I have had an iPhone for 3 years as well. I have to say that this is one of the Best apple out there for iOS.  It creates a beautiful visual interface from news, rss, facebook, and twitter feeds.  I love how it expands links and photos imbedded into tweets and also makes it east to see content on the original web page and then let you continue browsing Flipboard where you left off.  I was amazed at how good this app is for being free and feel that it would be worth paying $ for."
3722,GadgetComa,"June 8, 2011",5,"Great, full-featured 'everything' reader I'm truly impressed with user interface of this application. It is very intuitive. I found myself adding content and customizing to the point where I don't use my old RSS reader or Twitter client any more. It's also a more interesting way to read Facebook, although I would like to be able to filter out some of the posts like I can on my Mac. Still, that's a tiny nit compared to the beautiful design of this app and the ability to read all sorts of predefined and custom news and info sources."
3723,Armani Perez,"June 18, 2011",3,"Aight This app is really great it plugs you in a bit more and let's you see everything that going on right there in one app. No need for any news app or even twitter or Facebook. Best part about it is that it's not so crazy with all the updates. Plus it has a nice set up, flippings pretty cool haha only things I wish I could do is maybe have more than 2 pages cause there are so many sources you can get. Or at least a way to put the same type of news in 1 block which opens up to more blocks with those or just gets all of that and streams them to you.. Ya get me? and maybe a way to choose more than 1 news source at a time. Next update??? :D c'mon c'mon."
3724,FrunchyB,"December 15, 2011",3,"It's beautiful, but.... Allow font size control!!! One of the things I really liked about flipboard on the iPad is that you could get a good sense of an article before you clicked on it. In that sense, it really was a news *browser*. With the iPhone version, for most articles all you can see is a really big picture and the headline... If I could even see the first paragraph of text, that would be worthwhile. "
3725,ProfessorHines,"June 26, 2013",5,"One of the best apps to have! Flipboard is a very easy to use all in one information app! From news, to your favorite articles to your updates on FB and Twitter... Flipboard offers so much in one place, with easy to share options as well! I never liked going to multiple sites to read things so I just don't, but with this app I spend hours a week reading different articles and sharing them. Its very fluid in operation on my iPhone 4s with no lag and or buffers. Wonderful app that you should try for yourself!"
3726,Asdf12338650,"November 23, 2014",5,"Flipboard Evolved I had like so many others loved the original version of Flipboard for its beauty and immediate ease of use, and admittedly there was an initial shock and learning curve when this latest more robust version arrived. But it was a short-lasting shock and the also-short learning curve proved both painless and well worth embracing. Flipboard retains the essence of its original elegance and simplicity while now delivering quality content in a more evolved open manner. I learn about myself as Flipboard suggests new topics based on my usage behavior. Just terrific."
3727,Joe738,"January 5, 2015",1,"Not what it used to be I really hate that I can't like this app more. Clipboard used to be so easy and useful. I don't remember having an account, I found useful articles, and I could stop seeing sources that I can't stand. "
3728,Lifelearners,"October 7, 2016",4,Use it every day! I really like reviews that are posted long after someone has used an app. So that's why I'm posting. I've been using Flipboard for more than four years. I have customized it for the things that interest me which is one of the features I enjoy most. It's great because sometimes there are wonderful surprises in the categories and sources. Occasionally it doesn't quite find what I'm looking for but if I want that much precision I can always use Google. Different news apps appeal to different people so I recommend giving this one a try.
3729,NotInFacebook,"March 16, 2017",1,"Race to the bottom, complete! I've been using this app since day 1.  I've stuck with it through it's period of frequent ""sign up for an account"" nag screens, the auto playing video ads, etc.  Then they released this abomination.  Completely broke the app on my iPhone.  Lost all of my preferences, then wouldn't let me click on search results to re-add them.  Tried to reinstall, and found that NOW an account is mandatory!"
3730,Chris Burnham,"September 26, 2010",5,"Reason enough to own an iPad Hands down one of the greatest and most creative social network apps ever written. Even if you don't own any other apps, Flipboard alone is reason enough to buy an iPad.  It makes plain Twitter posts pop and you read things that might not have otherwise caught your attention.  I've noticed the new version of the official Twitter app has implemented some of the same concepts, which should give you an idea of how innovative Flipboard truly is.  Use it for a few minutes and you'll be hooked."
3731,ChipWV,"April 23, 2011",5,"Best way to read twitter posts I really like reading my twitter feed on Flipboard because it's not just 140 characters, but most of the story or photo that's linked.  Facebook is not as good, as it seems skewed to show photos and less text content. Many post are just not shown."
3732,BIG-C#1,"September 11, 2011",5,"Flipboard Review: I love Flipboard. It's one of my everyday all day apps. The only thing it is missing is Facebook chat integration. Also a way to post to Facebook & Twitter at the same time. I love the way I can casually flip threw all my friends status' and my tweets. I'm a big time ""tweeter"" and having a URL shortener built it is a great useful feature. I do however would like to see video tutorials rather then worded. Also some new features in future. All and all I love Flipboard and it's something I plan to permanently use for my Facebook & Twitter "
3733,Cobalt2795,"January 2, 2012",4,"Excellent for news. As long as you don't mind your music being interrupted I really love flipboard. It may actually keep my in the loop of things other than technology. the interface is clean and easy to understand, though I wish there was only one settings panel. Having one on the search ribbon and one from the gear is a bit confusing, but that's not a huge problem. Much more annoying though is that it interrupts music playing in the background sometimes when you switch to the app or open it. If this can be fixed I will gladly add a star to my review."
3734,Linsali,"March 29, 2012",5,"Fantastic app -- a Must-Have!!! I wasn't initially so sure about yet another social media type app but after using it several times, I have to say this is much better than most of the other apps out there!  I'd much rather see my Facebook feed, twitter stream, and a diverse and meaningful collection of web articles in this magazine format than fuss with multiple apps.  I love how I can instantly share links and tweet them.  I just can't say enough good things about how visually appealing the format is!  Just do yourself a favor and get it."
3735,troydawg,"March 31, 2012",5,"Amazing Aggregator Contained in Elegant Design If you a looking for a news and photo aggregator that gives you the same experience as flipping through your favorite magazine, look no further. After browsing through your first daily Flipboard, you will never again want to pick up a magazine. They've captured it all, from the visually appealing multi-panel layout to the nearly tactile action of flipping from page to page. This free download is the best app deal ever, because they could charge for this and it would be well justified."
3736,Billy Bob Joe Jr.$,"January 6, 2015",3,"Good But Bombarded by Media Sites I Don't Think Are Credible I really like the app but I want to be able to block certain media outlets from coming up in my feeds. For example I just wanna look at the news and I'm attacked by all of these negative articles. If I look up Jeb Bush for example to learn about him and his beliefs, I get article after article about how he is a homophobe. That is really annoying to see such negative stuff, and I'm sure it wouldn't more of the same if I was a non American and wanted to learn about Obama. I want to be able to block out sites that are so negative and cruel, especially Salon. Please add this it will make Flipbord so much better."
3737,EPooh,"April 29, 2016",4,"Great magazine I love this magazine as a way to quickly check out top news stories, recipes, misc. or other topics I am interested in at the time."
3738,Mamiharas,"August 8, 2016",3,"Spoiler Alert? This used to be my favorite news app. Easy to use. Easy to choose what you like and don't like. Best of all, you literally do flip to the next article. What has put me off are the spoilers though, which can't be avoided. A huge picture of the winner of some show with the title ""winner declared of ......."" I understand that it is the individual news outlet responsible for the writeup. In other apps, this kind of news can be avoided and you don't have to click on that article. With flipboard, you are already on the article before you know it. There needs to be some kind precheck before articles are viewable by the public."
3739,iDevice.RAC,"March 10, 2017",1,"One of the best!--not anymore This app is the reason why I bought an iPad. Elegant, fast, intuitive, easy to use. I am blown away by the UI. If you own an iPad and don't have this app you don't know what the iPad is capable of. Kudos to the development team."
3740,JenQ,"May 27, 2011",5,"Elegand AND Uuseful App! I second, third, fifth the other rave reviews.  This sits on my main screen and became my go-to iPad app within hours of first use.  Navigation is quick to get used to, you can quickly page through the information you want, and just as easily return to where you were.  "
3741,IRobert1989,"September 2, 2011",5,"I don't rate apps. Never. Seriously, I have never rated an app in my life. That should let you know how GREAT this app is. You can fully customize the pages to your interests including but not limited to facebook, twitter, and rss feeds. It will also take the feeds of certain websites and allow you to view everything in one place. Also, the streamlined design, as well as how smoothly the app functions really is the best for viewing almost everything. So far I have no complaints about this app. It is truly one of the best for the iPad."
3742,Natt Attack,"March 12, 2012",5,Flippin Love Flipboard! I couldn't ask for a better app. I can't wait to get it on my iPad. iPhone version is awesome! I tell all my iPhone and iPad friends about it. I love being able to quickly glance through the news I wanna know about without having to deal with ads or pointless articles. Thx for making my daily news updates less insane and irritating for me! I use Flipboard at least 3x a day for at least 15 minutes. And posting the stories I like or wanna save for later is soooooo easy! Flipboard rocks my socks!
3743,PianoGeoff,"March 20, 2012",4,"Great, but annoyingly inconsistent Great pocket version of the excellent iPad app. I only wish more sites would format for Flipboard. Those that don't only show a lead-in with a Read More button or link, and then you are stuck reading the article in the integrated, but sluggish web browser, which is conspicuously missing the Reader button that Safari has. I'm sure this is all a battle of web ads. Thinking of switching to NYTimes and NPR apps instead. I'll gladly pay/donate for great content with fewer/less annoying ads, but then I don't expect everything to be free and high quality."
3744,xMoonDevilx,"April 17, 2012",4,"Great App Update Review: The app constantly crashes whenever it is refreshed or updated with newer content (I.e. articles and such), is a real big pain...especially if you are commenting on an article reached from the App. Need to fix this. Had to reduce it to 4stars as a result."
3745,royjoysoyboy,"August 7, 2012",5,"Excellent The only news app that could possibly rival it is Alien Blue, which is amazing for totally different reasons. Both are worth buying an iPad for. It puts all your social networks in one place. The only problem I have with it is not being able to post anything, but that isn't what the app is for. It's for viewing news articles, and the layout is perfect for doing so. The app is beautiful on a retina screen. If you have soundcloud, there's even an integrated music player. Quite possibly the greatest app ever made."
3746,herrkelm,"November 28, 2012",4,"New favorite news reader I've been using flipboard for about a month as a replacement for my last rss reader. I've found it was very easy to add all my favorite feeds or search for others. It's a pleasure to read those newsfeeds in an eye-pleasing font and the flipping between articles is intuitive, although occasionally I had issues swiping from the article back to the feed (this could have more to do with my thumb or the angle of the swipe than the program itself). Overall, this is really worth checking out for reading news on the go."
3747,App-a-holic,"April 20, 2013",4,"Amazing App but not perfect User,"
3748,RGomezPhotos,"October 8, 2013",5,Great functionality! I've been a fairly long-term user of Flipboard. I love how it makes other social media channels easier to read and stay on top of.  More book-like.
3749,MoSamimi,"March 23, 2016",5,"My daily source of news I check Flipboard several times a day. It provides me with a quick look at the headlines from major news outlets. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that some of the news sources may not be as reliable as others, and may borderline on advertising or not being unbiased. This may not be the fault of Flipboard, but, I think there should be some criteria put in place to vet the sources more carefully. News on the environment is one of those areas."
3750,JimmyK.PDX,"September 20, 2010",5,"My Very Favorite App of All Time! If you have an iPad, then you've GOT TO have this app.  I can't say enough good about Flipboard.  It's simply fantastic!  Once you've set it up with content that matches your interests, you won't want to browse anywhere else.  Just flip through the attractive, magazine-like pages, and tap into whatever catches your eye.  I never look at Facebook or Twitter feed anywhere but Flipboard.  Everything is so much more attractively displayed, that I never want to see the boring layouts on the Facebook or Twitter sites again."
3751,Kyle Katz,"August 17, 2011",5,"Elegant I have only been using Flipboard for a little over a week. I don't download a ton of apps, prefering to use safari to access most of my favorites on the web. However, Flipboard has completely changed the way I consume information.  I tried to think of a word that best describes how I feel and relate to info via Flipboard and the word that keeps coming to mind is Elegant. Presentation, customization, readability, and an app that seems finished, not a live beta published too soon. Thanks for the amalgamation that for me is ""my perfect app""."
3752,TygerBryghtly,"January 16, 2012",5,"Ten thumbs up! I'm really too early with this review because I've only used Flipboard a few days and don't know all the ins and outs and don't have any constructive criticisms.  It is so uplifting to be able to select your content and have it presented to you in a beautiful format.  Mathematics, physics, music, art, ...  It really makes you totally want to rest in the things that bring you joy.  You have to also engage in the struggles of the world, keep up with what's happening.  Flipboard enables you to do that too.  That's what it is: enabling."
3753,SpauldingBusey,"August 22, 2013",3,"Want it to be my favorite again I loved Flipboard from the beginning, but recently I've found that, one by one, my RSS feeds are ceasing to work in Flipboard, despite working on the web and in other readers (such as Feedly, which is like Flipboard but, imo, not quite as elegant). Also, in the beginning, Flipboard devs were very responsive to my support queries. Lately, though, they've gone dead silent. I can understand that they're busy, but they haven't even acknowledged receipt of my recent support emails. I want to love Flipboard again, but given the recent performance of the app(and the devs), for now I just cannot. Three stars for what it once was for me."
3754,BaderB,"April 3, 2014",5,"Always improving - great for creatives! I've been using Flipboard for months now on a daily basis and love it! It's a great creative outlet, especially for curators, but the beauty of it is you don't have to create a single magazine to enjoy all Flipboard has to offer! The best part, though, is that they have a team always working behind the scenes to update, improve, and troubleshoot the app. I know if something isn't working, I give it a day or two and it's back up! I sound like I work for them...sadly no, though that would be cool!"
3755,wsucarlsen,"May 26, 2014",5,"Just keeps getting better I installed Flipboard but didn't use it much because other apps seemed to meet my needs. Then, during an iPad upgrade I decided to give it another look. Heck, the reviews were always good. I used to just think of Flipboard as a clipping service app."
3756,drwoodr,"November 2, 2014",2,"More is not necessarily better Flipboard is my most used app, but after using the new version a few days, I really don't like it. I used to be able to flip through the tiles, and I knew exactly where a particular news feed was located on my screen. Now with the continuous scroll in ""following"", it is not as efficient, I often scroll too far and have to waste motion scrolling back to the feed I want. The ""flip"" is what made this app so unique and functional. Bring it back. And I don't like that it opens in ""home"" and I need to make an extra motion to select the ""following"" icon in the bottom. Make it so I can have that view the default. More features is not necessarily better."

Please now allow the option for users to toggle the flip feature on or off, as it is indeed quite polarizing. ""You love it or you hate it."" Can't lie, I hate it, FLIPboard. It's only a matter of time before someone creates another Zite app and steals all the thunder Flip could have had. Actually, maybe I will."
3758,Paul D. Miller,"January 20, 2016",5,"Love this App! Good interface, smooth transitions between articles: Literary multimedia megamix! This is one of my favorite reading Apps. It combines several forms of reading - think of it as a visual RSS feed combined with any online media, and a great way to share and filter for content that you find. We all skim and browse themes and topics online, this App just lets you pull them all together in one place. Like Evernote, RSS, Google Keep, and other Apps that take your reading to the next level. Great for micro blogging as well. One of my favorite Apps."

It provided me with a single app to get news, Facebook, twitter, and more in an easy to use package.  But I found myself on the go not wanting to tether, or without  a hotspot and wishing I could read Flipboard.  I heard the rumors of Flipboard for iPhone/ipod touch and couldn't wait.  I am really excited to finally have Flipboard on my iPhone.  I have one suggested ""improvement"".  I wish I could swipe side to side (instead of up/down) like on the iPad to move between pages, outside of that, I LOVE IT!"
3762,SamMarieSaint,"December 11, 2011",4,"Almost There This a good app, and with a few changes it can become a great. First, unless I'm missing something, the Cover Story on the front page takes up too much real estate, especially for content a user can't control. Also, having only four available pages of content is a limitation. I don't want to have to click on a box and be taken to a scroll-down menu to see the rest of my saved news sources. I wish it can flow seamlessly from page to page as I keep adding content. This is the most important addition to include."
3763,Rad_bjorn,"March 30, 2012",5,"Amazing app!! It's free and offers a very unique and immersive way to view content from sources, even your own Facebook and twitter accounts. My ONLY gripe about this fantastic app is that it only let's you ""flip"" pages horizontally. Add a vertical or maybe even a flipp style similar to Apple's origami sideshow option for changing pages and I would be absolutely sold. But who can really complain, for being free, with no adds, and being as clean and sophisticated as it is this app is definitely a must have, especially if you have an iPad."

Easy, vibrant, constantly expanding.  Love finding new sources, especially international news, as well as old favorites (Shout out to Sunset for its huge presence). Only drawback is that stories often have no dateline so difficult to track most current updates on fast breaking stories.  Also, articles on science, medicine & tech tend to be very accessible & easy to understand."

3768,Old Zite fan,"December 7, 2015",1,Crashes on login I did the migration from Zite to Flipboard earlier and gave this app a shot.

I always welcome new improvements. While I'm still giving this app a 5-Star rating, I would like to see Flipboard work on getting rid of the the adds that automatically pop up and won't let you back out of the page unless you force quit the app. Or when the pop ups automatically send you to your AppStore. Please fix this issue. Thanks!"

Unlike the cluttered look of many image or video focused news aggregators or the email inbox style of the text focused ones, Flipboard achieves the right mix of images and text with an eye pleasing magazine style layout. It as if a talented editor reformatted all of your favorite news sources into a magazine personalized just for you. Easily replaces many separate apps you may already have."
3773,boombazookajoe,"July 8, 2011",5,Simply Stunning This is by far one of the best apps I have purchased for my iPad. Not only does the news look beautiful -- but I prefer to browse Facebook and Twitter on this way more than on their own websites or iPad apps. Does it include absolutely everything? No -- but it's a lovely way to look at the things that people are posting. I love it's capabilities to convert blogs and news websites that I frequent regularly and make them so pleasing to the eye. This is news and updates the way it should be. I recommend this app to everyone.
3774,Stumblet37,"December 3, 2015",2,"I want to keep Zite! I am also coming from Zite. What I loved about Zite was how simple it was to use and how nearly every article I read was something that interested me. I understand it's called ""flip"" board but it would be nice to be able to have the option to scroll through articles to find one to read. Having to constantly flip to find a news article is incredibly frustrating. Would also like to scroll through an article as well. It would be lovely to not have ads randomly appear as you're reading an article or looking for an article to read. I'll stick with this for now but will be looking for another news reader."

Instead, I find fluff and/or biased reporting pieces from a variety of ""news"" sources like Breitbart, Huffington Post and Daily Beast.  Most sites contain a repeat of ""news"" items several hours or days old.  A waste of time to spend perusing the links that this site has to offer.  I also find it impossible to limit or exclude articles from sites that have no interest in reading or following."
3776,angiedepdx,"September 14, 2016",5,Constant ads is annoying I have been using Flipboard since it came out. My favorite of all apps. But since they started with the ads reading news has become a nightmare. You click on one article and these ads start popping up or just show up making reading very intrusive to a point that I don't want to ready anything at all. I spend more time trying to close the ads or trying NOT to to click on them when scrolling down the page. 
3777,gunatit16,"September 27, 2016",4,"Great App...for newer devices If you are one of those people that update your phone regularly, you won't be disappointed with what Flipboard is doing here. Though I would like to see the comments section of stories a bit more intuitive and the notifications to let you choose what you will be alerted to and the notification section a bit more polished instead of huge blurbs/spotlights for the article in each response removed or aggregated under one 'Super Header', it's still a great app over all and have it installed on all my devices."

Much, much better than FB as a news platform because FB just puts you in a spiral where you only get what you like and never or rarely get new stuff. Using FB is like eating too many potato chips with a machine that just keeps serving up more chips as fast as you can eat them. Going to Flipboard is like going to a really well stocked departmental store where you can browse and get all kinds of nutritious stuff..."
3779,therickaustin,"July 30, 2017",5,Background processing? Granted I use Flipboard - a lot. My favorite app. But my Battery stats indicate 25% of my battery goes to Flipboard - x of it on screen and y of it background? What's it doing running in background? I have background refresh turned off for all apps (because of inadequate battery in this iPhone 7). Curious.

3781,Jon Blur,"August 28, 2011",5,Awesome This is a fabulous App. I love having all my social media and interests displayed in such a wonderful interface. It is so convenient and so gorgeous to look at.
3782,Andreo1950,"October 17, 2011",5,"Creative & Fun To Use...I'm Flipping Over This App! You have to admire the creative thought that went in to the development of this app.  The news sources are many and I like how they're categorized.  The entire layout is very appealing to the eyes, and the quick page flip is a plus...no delays or hesitation.  The topic search feature works great.  I have a few news apps that I have always enjoyed using and will continue to use, but Flipboard is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  All I'd like to say to the developers is BRAVO, WELL DONE!"
3783,rm4g3d0n,"March 20, 2012",5,Love this app I used google reader to read my blogs prior to this. Now I'm using this app full time to read them and more. I must rally commend this app and recommend it. It's a very beautiful way to read my daily feeds.
3784,hasmusicaltaste,"November 22, 2013",1,Censored The only problem with this app is if they don't like your opinion in their comment section they will block you from making comments and I don't mean if you cuss or are just a troll but if you speak your mind they don't seem to like it so be prepared for messages not being able to post replies if you have half a brain and they realize it. I'm not a conspiracist but this seems phoney if you are silenced if you make sense in an intellectual manner. Go figure. But people should know. If I'm wrong then prove me wrong and post all my comments that make sense but if the only way to make your voice known is thru app reviews so be it. We all deserve a voice no matter what because that is what we all want and what our forefathers fought for.
3785,Seaglass78,"November 1, 2014",1,"I'm not sure what they're thinking If you find it easy to determine what your favorite blogs are posting by whatever stock photo they stuck in the post then this update is for you. If, on the other hand, you rely on ""words"" to tell you what posts are about them you are out of luck. The recent update turned a really useful and attractive aggregator into a beautiful and useless aggregator. Most of my feeds are represented by featureless tiles. My Instagram feed features my lovely but unchanging profile pic, and even feeds that have images in them display no title content so you can't tell what the image is about (even Flipboard's curated feeds are this way). Bummer Flipboard, you've sent me back to the App Store supermarket after years of happy use."
3786,Tharin.W,"November 6, 2014",5,"Customizable, quick, and easy to use I and very nitpicky in the news apps that I have chosen. I always hated getting held down by seeing news I didn't really care about, or not being able to see enough options so that I can choose what I really want to look at. That's why I am so glad I got Flipboard. It simply is AWESOME"
3787,SunnerLife,"November 22, 2014",4,"Nice way to follow trends I'm interested in I did not use the previous version of Flipboard, so I can't speak to the disappointment that most long-time users seem to be experiencing. "
3788,Cperrywv,"January 18, 2015",2,This was literally my favorite app I just wanted to start by saying I have been a long time user of flipboard and a HUGE advocate. I've introduced probably 100 people to the app. That being said- look elsewhere. 
3789,GiftedMike,"April 4, 2015",5,"I love this app, great news reader This is probably the most used app on my iPad.  I love the way I can quickly flip through articles and read the ones that capture my interest the most.  Also, pretty seamless integration with social media sites."
3790,Nikolai18,"July 7, 2011",5,"Remarkable I can commend this app no other way than by saying that it is one of the very few that truly utilizes the iPad. It is not awkward, it is not difficult, it does not lag or glitch. This app is a glimpse of what the iPad promised, a step forward in technology and a step toward the integration of media, networking, news, and whatever should come next. I have no doubt that there are still features I am unaware of and it will be my sincere pleasure to explore them further. Buyer be warned, you will miss out if you pass this up."
3791,jhwhiteh,"December 11, 2011",5,"Love it!!! Have the app on my iPad2 and my iPhone 4S and I use to to read and manage all my social content and all my tech reading.  Te new integration with the offline readers of your choice is awesome.  Also, with a Flipboard account, any changes to your panels will be reflected on all your devices. "
3792,James from Sonoma,"December 31, 2011",5,"So smooth Flipboard supplements my daily read of the NYT and WSJ with extra news and photos from sources you'd otherwise spend much time accessing and surfing. The entry to full articles from the primary source and return to Flipboard home is SMOOTH. Love the photos of news stories that you don't see in regular papers. Loading time for updates is fast and SMOOTH. My only complaint is the content of some areas is weak. E.g. The health section shows articles from popular health magazines, not health news per se and not science or medicine."
3793,Jim-Michelle,"January 4, 2012",3,"Nervous I LOVE this app, but when I try to access Facebook through it, it asks me to give permission for Flipboard to access my info, my friends' info, and send messages, posts, etc. on my behalf.  Really?!?  I have my information protected as much as possible on Facebook and now Flipboard wants me to open that AND my connections to them?  Not sure what they are doing...possibly collecting data for advanced marketing programs, but I am not sure I want that.  I certainly don't want to agree to that on my friends' behalf.  Am I missing something?....other than not using Flipboard for Facebook?  Will it do this when I decide to use Twitter too?"
3794,SequentialGuy,"March 22, 2012",5,"Great interface The app has a nice interface that both is easy to navigate and is every bit stylish. I like the whole ""flip"" function which makes it both easy and settled on the eyes. As for the actual news, the app always offers something new, sports, technology, economy, you name it. It's also updated regularly so expect something new now and then. I highly recommend to anyone even to those who don't regularly look at the news offered on their homepages."
3795,edwperry53,"June 15, 2013",5,"Awesome Flipboard does a great job integrating your social media into any other interesting trends or topics you may want to follow on your daily life. Wether it's a check on your break at work or just something to do when your bored, flipboard does an awesome job of pulling all the things you want to read about into one integrated app. The only thing I can say I wish it would have was more dedicated user boards in the sense that I would like to see more in the editors picks, or at least more frequently updated."
3796,papaporro,"June 15, 2013",5,"Love this app After installing and using this app for a couple of months now, I have deleted all my other news gathering apps.  This is the only one I use now.  Everyday!  Still some inconsistencies - some stories you flip right to left, others you scroll down and other you have to link for the full article.  I assume this has more to do with the source, but it would be cool if they could make it a bit more consistent.  Otherwise, I can't think of anything negative.  Great job."
3797,SoftTony,"November 4, 2013",5,"A great place to start If you are a news or information junkie or just want to get a glimpse of what is what is currently going on in the country or the world, this is the site for you!!!!"
3798,ColieAlexandra,"February 1, 2014",5,"Love it! Read every day on the commute. Only bummer is that there's no way to Pin any articles. It makes sense since they are competing with Pinterest, however it's much easier to share content on Pinterest with my friends because they're all on it. Haven't yet gotten more than 2 people to use flipboard with me. One day..."
3799,newsjunki123,"April 21, 2015",5,"Flipboard gave my phone AIDS the title is as it says.  the new update has given my beautiful 6+ AIDS.  made the screen start flickering and presses random icons.  this includes the phone, safari, and iMessage.  Used to use it a lot and it was a reasonable aggregator.  Don’t know what they did, but after having to restore my phone several times just to find the offending app, I don’t want anyone to go through this.  So many random people called and sent gibberish that had to be explained via iMessage on my computer."
3800,KilJoy,"July 24, 2010",1,"Not Ready For Prime Time - Private Beta for Now I'm not sure what the developers of this app we thinking, but my guess is that they weren't. They gave early access to the WSJ and a review was written by WSJ the day before Flipboard was released on the app store. I assume they know that Apple has sold millions of iPads and that a write up in the WSJ might draw quite a bit of attention from those millions of iPads. The result is a great big bag of FAIL."
3801,R20162017,"May 8, 2013",5,"I love it and use it everyday! It's important for me to read through 30-40 publications daily to find stuff to put on my blog and this makes it so easy. I haven't really used the magazine item yet bec I didn't see a point yet... I do appreciate this app, I would say that it would be even better to be able to export a full article with picture into blogger to make my life easier. I don't want a link to put into blogger, but rather the entire article in it with a link at the bottom."
3802,Greyhawk2013,"October 3, 2013",5,Goodbye yahoo news!!! For months I've been frustrated with yahoo for changing the format of their news. You don't fix something that's not broke. We found this app and WOW!!! The app allows me to open right to the sections I want without having to scan thru articles I don't. The interface is smoother than google news as well. It's like flipping thru a magazine and of coarse the pictures are brilliant and beautiful. I also like that articles flip instead of scroll. Job well done!
3803,John & Tasha,"April 1, 2014",5,"Best App Ever! Awesome app for IPad.  This is my go to app for business, technology, and research articles.  Also can access fun topics too!  It's a magazine where you choose the topics you like, either in depth or brief.  My favorite is the headlines where I can get snippets of items (anything from National news, fashion, to UFOs in your area).  Use it everyday.  Tried a lot of other apps prior to this like AOL, etc.  None came close to this one.  You get to choose what you want to see and the app puts it all together.  You will like this app."
3804,Sylinvio,"November 2, 2014",5,"Zite and Flipboard effectively woven together in 3.0 I always liked zite more than Flipboard, appreciated the recommendation engine and streamlined view of stuff I would be interested in seeing, but always liked the ui and look of Flipboard as well as the ability to plug in exact sources. Bam, now you have the great recommendations of zite, plus your favorite sources, all in a beautiful interface. People always hate when something changes majorly at first as they figure it out but trust me, this update is for the better. Love it."
3805,null pointer exception line 0,"November 16, 2014",2,"Used to be great… Now doesn’t preload stories Flipboard used to be great, but its nearly worthless to me now. My old use case is this: Running to the subway, open Flipboard on my iPhone and flick it to reload all the topics. Get on subway (with no internet) and i can read various news summaries and email articles that look interesting to myself for later. I could eat up 2/3 of my ride that way. My new use case is: Running to the subway, open Newsify and flick it to reload all the topics, etc etc… because Flipboard no longer preloads/caches anything outside of the Home screen. It is 99% unusable now without a constant internet connection. Its really sad because i loved Flipboard."
3806,Newsflip77,"March 5, 2015",5,"Best news app to date It is by far the best of my 5 news apps. Besides the original concept, being able to customize what topics/kinds of news and cover stories are presented to you and filter out what you don't care about saves so much time and is incredibly useful. and the ability to make and subscribe to different 'magazines' is soooo useful for filtering and keeping news about topics too specific to have their own apps or for lack of a better term magazines..."
3807,Princessmdo,"August 3, 2015",3,"Wonderful when it's working properly People check their notifications, how about disabling the flip to front when people pull down from the top? I can't be the only one this upsets when merely checking notifications. Also the app can not multi-task. Read an article on the browser (like it makes you do), return to the app and you're  back on the home screen. After flipping through 50+ articles it can become bothersome when you're frequently directed off the app. Heaven forbid you respond to a text or switch to another app for a minute.  /sigh. Give us a good ol fashioned bookmark please."
3808,VJ 108,"June 18, 2016",4,"Pretty easy and quick way to catch up Though it mentions for you to make an account, it helps because then you select areas of interest for the news and stories you will read. Sometimes there are some amazing article they touch upon. I like that there is no need to scroll, I feel this makes it easier. I removed. A star because I usually have to go through a lot of articles I don't want to read, so sometime it doesn't seem to focus on the areas I would like it to. But none the less, still a great app."
3809,Pat_Sr,"March 14, 2017",3,"Flawed update Flipboard is easily one of the the top apps for iOS. However, this latest update has seriously altered what users have gotten used to with Flipboard. The landing page forces you to select topics and does not allow you to get to the magazines that you follow without picking a random topic. It has become very frustrating and the opposite of what Flipboard has represented... an easy to use app to aggregate much of what one follows in online media. Please consider returning the previous path for users as opposed to the forced choices of topics. Maybe there is some benefit for a first time user, but not for long time users."
3810,Mia,"June 11, 2011",4,"Unique and Different I love to interface that flipboard brings to the iPad. It's new, beautifully designed and it's attractive setup allows users to enjoy various articles, photos, and blogs with a swish tap or swirl of a finger. However, I do admit that it was slightly difficult to understand how to use at first so plan on taking a good 10-15 minutes getting used to the controls and the different pages u can potentially add. Once u get the hang of it though it's really simple and fun to use and very different than the typical social networking or rss readers u might come across..Not bad for a free app"
3811,zymmin,"October 25, 2011",4,"Good app, needs improvement. I like this news aggregator very much, easy to navigate and pretty fast.  "
3812,M.Midnite,"October 31, 2011",5,"Pretty slick I'm finding this app to be quite fun going back to daily. For me I really enjoy how FaceBook is viewed through this app. One thing I still have problems with on apps like this though is the swipe motion, either the area is to cluttered with too many posts and I may get that post instead of the next page or it goes smoothly. I'm pretty sure it's me. But the content available is enough to keep one busy for a long while. I'm still discovering the many different places to go to."
3813,ElisaJ,"November 6, 2011",5,"Love this app I started the switch to on line news by searching many websites and piecing together my own version of what this app does so beautifully. I tried a competitor's ... attempt ... at this same idea, but deleted it after daily crashes.  Then I decided to try Flipboard due to an online recommendation from someone else who was frustrated with the same competitor. I'm so glad I made the switch. Flipboard is really well designed and it delivers what it claims it will deliver. It deserves the five star rating."
3814,Seaglass hunter,"February 7, 2012",5,"I didn't have clue how much I NEEDED this! This is only the second review I've ever written.....but it is worth the effort!  So many great things to compliment....FACEBOOK is a whole new experience and I LOVE the random content!  Especially love the ability to customize what my favorites are....I wish....hmmmm... I KIND OF wish I could access my Pinterest bookmarklet, but even if I find something and leave to PIN IT....it takes me back to where I left off!  Haven't turned on the TV for 3 days.....AND I'm really connecting again with the world news!  GREAT FREE APP!"
3815,Xairgetlam,"March 21, 2012",5,"Great app! This app makes it easy to view articles from all of my favorite websites in one place. There is large selection to choose from with many well known sources. The best part is the interface, which displays several articles across the screen in various sizes with their respective thumbnail images. You then flip through by swiping your finger across the page, tapping on anything that you want to read. Very modern and visually pleasing, this app will be on my iPad for many years to come."
3816,jollysushi,"April 20, 2012",5,"The perfect fit For a long time I had been looking for an app where I could do my daily news reading. I had tried a couple out there and was very dissatisfied until I head about flip book from a graphic design teacher of mine who has it in his iPad. He raved about it in front of the class and I came I find out they have it for the iPhone too! It is so interactive and user friendly. I love it. I can see my Facebook, twitter and even instagram all in one place even more than what I wanted. :)"
3817,Darkville,"May 13, 2012",5,"The Perfect iOS companion This app sets the bar on what other apps need to bring to the table. I have replaced so many others with this. The concept of pulling any other source and making it part of this experience is an excellent premise. I love love love the interface. It especially shines on the iPad. The ability to have your profile saved to multiple devices is a genius idea when coupled with the presentation quality present here. Slick, pretty to look at, useful; one of my permanent front page apps."
3818,allularmilo,"November 26, 2012",5,"Simplistic, but so very helpful. For once, I find an app for reading news, peering through my Facebook, tumblr, and instagram feeds, as well as finding interesting new things. This app is deserving of all five stars, and them some."
3819,Christina(:,"November 27, 2012",5,"Absolutely a Must-Have! Especially on iPhone 5! I don't like to consider myself a news person, I hardly ever watch news and I'm too busy to be launching different news apps just to know what's going on in different areas of news (style, technology, celebrity, politics, etc...). So I find Flipboard to be AMAZING! Not only because the wonderful design makes it look cool for my iPhone 5 & iPad, but I can honestly say that it has actually made me more interested in news! I love reading my Flipboard, I'm always on it now!"
3820,Audiogod001,"July 24, 2010",2,"You Should Probably Be Ready, Before You Launch An App This APP is an interesting idea.  Too bad they were not ready to launch.  FB and Twitter integration is the main selling point, access to those has been limited by the company until they figure things out on the end."
3821,San Rique,"May 25, 2011",4,"Great concept! Slow to update The title says it all. Great concept and I love it! The integration of graphics and arrangement of content is genius! So simple and easy! The only reason for the 4 star rating is it's slow to update some content and social networks even though iPad is constantly connected to the Internet. I know this was more developed around media content and not so much social networks, but now that social networks are part of the app, it'd be great to see more little clever shortcuts to access more features of our social networks...primarily Facebook. Great app though!"
3822,Newone757,"October 30, 2014",2,A big step backwards I'm sorry but this new update is terrible. I seas originally captivated by clipboard with it awesome interface and unique approach to content consumption. Now the Nav bar at the bottom and with way less information on the screen that contains all your feeds I might as well be using a list based reader. This does not at all feel like clipboard and its implementation is half baked. Why mess with something that worked so well in the past? It was just the right balance of information available in the previous tile layout. I'll be heading over to check out some alternatives as all these new features for the navi tabs at the bottom go unused by me.
3823,r.r.e.,"November 8, 2014",2,"Bring back the old design! Flipboard used to be the most used app on my phone, but the new redesign has changed that. It seems like the app has traded functionality for a poor attempt at creating a social network. I don't care about connecting with friends and sharing stories—what I want is a clean interface where I can easily browse my news and feeds. I do not use the ""home"" screen so I now have to click away from it every time I open the app to see the content I care about. And in this version the tiles do not refresh, which is one of the features I valued in Flipboard. I wish I hadn't updated and am looking for a replacement app."
3824,chc30a,"December 22, 2014",1,"So bad I'm writing my first review ever I've been using an iPhone for a number of years and Zite was my favorite app. When I learned this was to be the new Zite I felt I had no choice but to try it. So far, I've found the content on the whole, irrelevant, the interface slow and cumbersome and fair % of the content junk (any editors here?!?). Forget about graphic heavy content - not going to be looking at that any time soon - take a nap and come back. Even ""Pinning"" something was cumbersome. Also, as far as I can tell there is no easy way to exit to the source, such as a newspaper's website (i.e.: view source)."
3825,ImaZombieAreYou,"October 24, 2015",4,"Better than Apple News but here's how to make it perfect I've been using Flipboard since I got my first iPad some 5 years ago and it's truly my favorite goto for a magazine-type news feed. I've tried a bunch of similar apps along the way(which always got deleted immediately) including the most recent Apple News(which you can't delete, I tried). Here comes the ""but"" for the developers that would change my 4 stars to 5.....accommodate for landscape reading on especially the iPhone 6/6s Plus phones please. Thanks. (Your 5th star awaits!)"

This all went away when told I had a subscription but didn't have a password which trip stopped me. Next time I opted to register through Facebook what ever that means. Again after 30 minutes of picking words/topics the Facebook got shut off as a route into flipboard. I have some access to articles but don't know how or why. I just want current science articles to read not to twit or Facebook or whatever social media things.
3827,Lkwaspswatter,"December 31, 2015",3,"It's grown on me Still hate the constant flip flip flip to get to articles as I was always more of a fan of Zite, but seeing as that is no longer an option I now use Flipboard daily. The article suggestions are finally on par with Zite. I wish that the thumbs up and down rating for articles be less hidden and more a part of the UI, as sometimes I forget its even an option, which may be the developers point. This was the best part of Zite and while it's technically here in flipboard it's hidden away in different spots depending on where you are in the app. I like being able to curate my own suggestions."
3828,loriannmahre,"October 17, 2016",5,"Definitely worth it I've been an iPhone user for years and this is my first review on any app...I found this looking for apps that successful people use. This was one of them and hands down - it's worth it. Gives me articles on all the things I want to read about most (you get to pick topics you enjoy and it will compile articles for you). I use this at night before bed or on a lunch break. If you love to learn and read, this is definitely for you. I recommend this app 100%!"
3829,LFGarcia24,"October 18, 2016",5,"One of the best apps I have ever had This app is my main form of information. It is tailored specifically to what I wanna see on my feed. I realized that Instagram, Facebook, snapchat and any other social media based apps take up way too much time from us and are very misleading. Providing a lot of misinformation and actually dumbing us down more than making us smarter. I have had the app for a few months now and have since deleted all my social media accounts. I've never been happier."
3830,grlovesthisapp,"July 31, 2010",1,"Facebook connect is LAME!! For the other features, the content has interesting flow....great idea, and hopefully the choices for content will increase.  That said, the Facebook aspect is a dismal failure, and they really should quit promoting it.  It loads, it doesn't load.....when it does, it's a couple of items, inconsistent, not the LEAST bit reflective of a Facebook experience......it's a HUGE disappointment.  Yes, the app is free, and yes, the content for other items works much better, but my point is that if you're going to promote something, or make a claim  in connection with your product, it should be reasonably accurate and true.  For flipboard to make any claims about Facebook and their ability to handle and display the content is just false!"
3831,Closet Reader,"August 7, 2010",5,"Wow! One of the definitive iPad apps Although I've downloaded and used hundreds of apps, I write relatively few reviews...but this one is worth it. Flipboard is a truly stunning mashup of social media, mainstream media, information design, and mobile application usability. If you have a Facebook and/or Twitter account, you owe it to yourself to try this out, if for no other reason than to get a hint of where the world is heading to: easily digestible, personally relevant, real-time information curated by people you know. Just gorgeous."
3832,Ann O'Noumous,"January 19, 2012",5,"Great visual tool for reading I have been using Flipboard for a week now, and it has changed the way I read my Twitter feeds. The way it is laid out is intuitive, similar to a magazine page, and it is easy to find additional types of content to my settings. My favorite part is seeing a short blurb from the content that is linked from a tweet. It is a great way to keep up with the high volume of professional content I read on a daily basis."
3833,Bopa,"February 5, 2012",5,"Flipboard Recommendation I want to thank the developers, first. Very nice result. There is very little I do online that cannot be connected to FB directly. Font and layout style is appealing. Navigation is completely intuitive for me...not an easy task, I'll bet! Recommend the use of FB for the busy Digital Immigrant. You'll be glad you did. It is a great place to start if you prefer to discover and research, too. I will use FB often, going forward. Thanks again, you're efforts on our behalf are sincerely appreciated. Much obliged."
3834,chris hansford,"February 18, 2012",5,"like this app very much This app is very easy to use and provides a lot of information that is in line with my interests. My only gripe is that the filter for individual news articles does not prevent having the same article over and over. I suspect that certain articles are open to reuse on many publication from sources like the Associated Press and so they are just reprinted all over the place, The App should be able filter those out. "
3835,DanceFloorDoll,"November 23, 2012",3,Great app when it works I seem I be having a bit of an issue with deleting different news groups from the 'Your Flipboard' section of the app. I go to remove them and sometimes it says removed on the page but then sometimes it refreshes and shows all the news stations I just deleted. Other times the page stays blank but then I go to the main pages with all the news stories and such they're all still there. Is this a bug with the app because its highly annoying... Otherwise I enjoy being able to read different news that I otherwise miss.
3836,News aficianado,"June 12, 2013",4,"Great App, but ... This is by far my most used app, both on the iPhone and iPad. I have and continue to enjoy using it. Prior to this recent update, however, the last update created a glitch that is absolutely maddening. Every single time I open or return to the app, it prompts me to login to Facebook (which I've already done). If I click OK, it takes me into the settings, but doesn't prompt me to login once I'm there, because, as I mentioned, I'm already logged in. I will give this app that fifth star as soon as this glitch is resolved. Keep up the good work!"

I asked editor site to send me my password, which seems to have worked, but I never get the email.  I would also be nice to be able to access just my business page on FB, and not my personal.  If I can get this to work like I think that it should, it could be a nice marketing tool for clients wanting info on specific subjects. That seems to be a big IF right now."
3838,Agentcorndog#2,"May 13, 2016",5,"New York Times articles issue So I get a page that says I need to subscribe to the New York Times in order to read more than 10 of their articles a month. I tried subscribing to them but flipboard does not recognize that. I have no idea if this system is intentional or not but it's broken and rather annoying when a bunch of articles all show up in my feed, only to find out I can't read them. Love this app. Thanks for giving me a place to read news."
3839,Hbaxi,"May 15, 2017",5,"My favorite news app! There are lots of news apps out there. From the Flipboard first launched, it's been my favorite. I love the interface - flipping through the news items is just right for mobile devices. I love the fact that I can connect my newspaper and magazine subscriptions to get unfettered access to material from those sources. Also love the sharing features. If you haven't already tried it, I would strongly recommend you make it your primary news app!"
3840,Argent009,"July 21, 2010",5,"Same problem I am getting the over capacity error too. I think it's because several major tech news sources have reported about this app all at the same time and flooded it with hits, so it would be unfair to downrate it without being able to properly test it. I hope this problem is resolved soon since most of the reviews have been quite favorable. Giving 3 stars for now based on the reviews of others, might change once it works for me."
3841,Creative Task Master,"September 2, 2011",5,"Flipboard rocks When I bought my iPad I got it for reading and game playing. I wasn't really reading on it until Flipboard. A friend introduced me to it and since I downloaded it, I'm reading all kinds of articles from a variety of sources. I'm even reading stuff that friends have posted on Facebook that I wouldn't otherwise read. And I'm rereading stuff that I posted because the articles and RSS feeds look so good here. The interface is so inviting. I can't wait to browse through all the new material. It's amazing."
3842,MontanaMuse,"January 13, 2012",1,Serious problem I love the way this app looks app...BUT
3843,JuanMN,"March 19, 2012",5,"Must-Have for Any iOS Device Owner. Flipboard is often the first app that I suggest to any new iOS device owner looking to get the most out of their purchase.  Creating what can be described as your own dynamic, personal magazine tailored to your interests and updated constantly is a perfect example of why the mobile space is quickly displacing traditional desktops and laptops. "
3844,The cooler guy,"April 30, 2012",4,This is an awesome news app over all. So first off I would just like to say that this is definitely worth your download. The apps interface is fantastic and it makes reading news interesting...to an extent. My one request is that you should b able to read the cover stories without having to go to there category. Or at least make it the first story in the category. I was using the app five minutes ago and I couldn't find the cover story within the categories...I don't know maybe it is obvious but it isn't working for me.
3845,Veggiebond,"October 30, 2012",3,Not made for offline Flipboard's strength lies in its flipping page layout. But for one strength comes one great weakness: poor accessibility. 
3846,Pope McGoke,"April 16, 2013",5,"The best I've tried others, Flipbook is indeed without equal. If you are looking for an aggregate now that iGoogle is being discontinued, this is the answer. While I'm unsure if you can simply add RSS feeds (note: you may not be able to do this), it's far more easy and worthwhile addition g the sites you want to follow and get to work curating or enjoying what others have curated, it's just a quality app. I find myself just opening it without thinking about what I really want to do. That's the true test of a great app."
3847,K8idid,"October 26, 2015",5,"Flip is my $h!t Flipboard has been my go to app for not only my news, stories, updates, research and inspiration that are specific to my interests, but also, a way to capture a two-year now long running obsession with new research around ancient history. I love the community, being able to access other's boards to see how minds work, and the access I have to retrieve a collection of information that I long forgot about, but is still relevant to a current project. Super 5-star from me."
3848,thebaumer,"March 1, 2016",1,"Avoid this terrible app like the plague Flipboard was overrated when it came out, and over the years it has only gotten worse. The interface is clunky, hard to organize and they seem to only want to show you certain content. I miss Zite so much. It was streets ahead of this terrible app. For some reason I have kept Flipboard installed, hoping it might be useful or change into something I could use. But it instead it spams me with notifications about articles I have ZERO interest in. And it will do it for the same article every day for a week. Here's a notification for you, Flipboard - you're getting deleted! A non functional Zite is way better than this app. I'll just stick to Pocket and feedly."
3849,Thepsilam,"June 1, 2017",5,"Still my Go-To app It takes a little getting used to, but the latest update to Flipboard is good. I have a few nit picks, but I like the layout better than Apple News, which feels like a firehose. My Magazine Dorks has benefitted from the broader selection of categories implemented in the newest version. Keep on making performance enhancements! My aside is I wish the iPad app would get a version closer to the phone- at least easier to get to the new categories- they are buried."
3850,Samplespace,"October 26, 2011",5,"Must have in your iPad Everything is great in this app. User friendly and simply interface. We can now have our own magazine filled with things we're interested for free!! One thing that I found it's a bit of inconvenient is I can't refresh only one page, for example, if I wanna refresh twitter, I need to refresh them all topics I got in the Flipboard. And I found a bug when I send tweet with attachment, the picture is still there, doesn't goes with the tweet, have to restart the app."
3851,mcypert09,"November 25, 2011",5,"Simply awesome At first, I was reluctant to download this app because I thought it was more focused on social media after reading the description. I don't use social media and I was looking for a multi-news network app for reading a broad range of current events. I couldn't have ask for a better app. The amount of news you can simply navigate through with this app tops all the other news apps I have combined. This app freaking rocks and is hands down one of the best apps for the iPad!"
3852,_Richman_,"March 16, 2012",5,"I read much more news thanks to this app. Because of this app and it's huge library of newspapers, magazines, blogs, and more, I find myself more and more reading articals from many sources, than from a few sources.  Using Read-It-Later, I can load up on the latest articals before a flight and have something extra to read on the plane that's more literary and pertanent than an airline magazine.  This is one fantastic app that I'm going to use much on my iPad2, and look forward to it expanding!"
3853,jyoseph,"March 18, 2012",5,"Amazing App This app is amazing. I'm a hard core feed reader kind of guy, and would never think to leave my RSS feeds. But this app makes it possible. Not only that, but it integrates with Google Reader so I don't have to leave my feeds behind after all. "
3854,jatowler,"March 23, 2012",5,"Brilliant app I'm not sure how I read news before Flipboard. It's social media and actual journalism rolled into some magical amalgam and presented as a real newspaper. Being able to skim headlines from Facebook and Al Jazeera and The Verge all in one place is just awesome. And it doesn't hurt that the app is beautiful, to boot."
3855,Rock max,"August 16, 2012",5,awesome i love this app on my ipad. thank you for releasing it for iphone. my account updated fine on both.  just wish i could save images from within the app without having to open them in safari. 
3856,Slow Interact,"February 1, 2014",5,"Beats Web Browsing for Information Browsing the Web for information has never been this good.  The magazine format is much more appealing to the eye, organizes content, and presents information chronologically.  Web browsing almost always offers information in random fashion with no attention to age of the information.  The ability to save items to your own custom magazine is far better than saving to favorites.  This has become a favorite app for me overnight."
3857,Coach RT,"March 16, 2014",5,"Relevant, succinct and beautiful I first scan Technology and Business. The sources have been relevant for my company and the format lets you skim many articles in a very short time. I have forwarded to coworkers more articles from Flipboard than from any other source. "
3858,jck112,"November 1, 2014",2,Downgrade? They seem to have eschewed the previous minimalist design for something much more complex and feature full.  Which I'm sure some users who are using Flipboard as a content discovery platform will appreciate.

3860,VicDiesel,"August 21, 2010",2,Form: cool. Function: below freezing Forget that this app was overhyped and that the launch was somewhat rickety. Try to use it.

3862,Dallin V.,"May 19, 2011",5,"No need for any other news app This app will be your first and last stop for everything that is going on in the world around you. Totally customizable, it will connect with everything that is going on with your Facebook friends to everything that is going on across the nation and around the world. Awesome user interface, beautifully designed and easy to use. If you only have one app make it this one. PS Flipboard, will you please work on an iPhone version? That's how addicted I am."
3863,Cher Guevara,"May 21, 2011",4,Almost Perfect Likey: Gorgeous user interface that is both intuitive and totally works with the capabilities of the iPad. Very easy to set up. Best content delivery system I've used. 
3864,Fifi Bentley,"June 8, 2011",5,Excellent way to stay informed! This app is frequently touted as the best way to stay on top of your social media contacts. But it is also an outstanding way to consume all manner of news and info completely non social media related.
3865,visual0ne,"August 6, 2011",5,"I don't write many reviews I really never write these things. That having been said, this app is pretty amazing. It totally jacks you in, plugs you up, and gives you all the best of the web, in one place. This thing reads like a magazine, where all the stories and pictures are relevant to your life. It has just about every social portal built right in. From Facebook to Twitter, Instagram and Flickr, this app plugs you in and doesn't leave much to be desired. Check it out. You'll be glad you did."
3866,Dundertaker,"May 15, 2016",3,"Flip needed to use the best features of ZITE and they didn't. I had both FLIPBOARD and ZITE...then they bought ZITE and wasted the opportunity to take the best of ZITE (which was a much better user interface) and threw it away.  Specifically the swipe up/down to like or dislike content.  The current U/I is clunky and takes too many steps.  The algorithms are much worse recently too.  Example:  I have ""auto"" as a section and about 45% of the page recently became motorcycle articles....and I have a motorcycle section.  Great example of how a buyout not to merge two platforms......hopefully they actually read these."
3867,phthaloblu,"September 14, 2016",1,"Flipboard No More I used to love this app, when I first got it. Over the years, the intrusiveness of the pop-up ads has gotten worse and now it's just irritating and annoying. Today is the second time I've been confronted with a potentially malicious ad that only allows a yes click, otherwise you have to force quit the app. And now I've also noticed auto-play video ads with no way to turn that crap off. So, I'm done. I don't need this in my busy life and there are alternatives. Way to go, Flipboard, by taking a good thing and ruining it and chasing your customers away. I now look forward to you and your advertisers demise. There's always someone waiting to fill the gap left by the greedy out of touch like you."
3868,Claire Richardson,"September 29, 2016",5,"I love Flipboard I use this app daily, both to keep up with the days news, and to explore in depth topics of interest. I love the option of flipping articles of interest into my own magazine, to read later and to share with others. If there is a topic I wish to explore in depth I can do that with Flipboard. The interface is easy to learn and the graphics are inviting. I have it linked to my twitter as well and it is really easy to share articles via Facebook, email, etc."
3869,Youssica,"February 25, 2017",4,"Excellent update Previous review: It requires a minimalistic, clean UI. Tips: make use of blur and large images. (3 stars) "
3870,Laravisuals.com,"March 3, 2012",5,"Great App Love this app. It's my daily newspaper of sorts. Once you start adding your different sources/feeds. It's hard not to keep coming back. App runs smoothly, it does feels like a magazine. Great simple, yet modern design & feel. If you need to email or share posts it's pretty simple. "
3871,Xian_Toa,"March 11, 2012",5,Flipboard makes the iPad the iPad. Flipboard is the first pick as an essential iPad app (also a must have for iPhone/iPod Touch). There's nothing to hate and everything to love.
3872,E. Seay,"March 13, 2012",5,A great way to get your news Flipboard makes reading the news enjoyable. Just tell it what you're into and it does the rest.
3873,Speed of Sound,"March 13, 2012",5,"One of the best, and what a steal! Flipboard is honestly one of the best of its kind. I'm the type that likes certain sections of different magazines, so the ability to meld them along with my own news is convenient and cost effective! And since news comes in within nanoseconds, it provides a good database of information. Being a pre-law/public relations junior interested in global policy and business, I highly recommend both iPhone and iPad versions to anyone in PR, business, law, or those who like to stay informed."
3874,PacifiGator,"March 22, 2012",5,"My favorite app I use it every day. I don't even use the native Facebook app as much anymore.  I especially like the ability to send articles to my Instpaper account directly from the first article page. Previously, you had to push a couple buttons to get the article opened in Safari to do so (unless I kept missing some direct way to do it directly like there is now). Retweets to Twitter and sharing on Facebook are very simple and readily accessible. Even more amazing that it's free."
3875,Mariemire,"July 22, 2012",3,"No content? When I flip app open all the categories say that there is no content. You can circuitously get around this but this bug would best be fixed. This is the first time I've had problems. As for the content (when you get to it), there are times I just want to flip around and look at things; give my brain a rest from more rigorous pursuits. Even then, you do run into very interesting things. As for left leaning, if you allow that to color all you see in this app you are missing out on most of its content. Too bad. "
3876,j.e.r-s,"December 21, 2012",3,"Love, mostly I love a lot of things about this app and use it daily. Despite reading many reviews I haven't found any that reflect a problem I've continued to have: repeatedly I find that posts from my subscribed blogs and websites are not updated to flipboard, often even days after many new posts have been added. Similarly, I find that posts are occasionally not chronologically shown, and week-old posts are shown as most recent (usually this happens in conjunction with posts not being updated on flipboard as they are posted on the blogs). Small glitches, perhaps, but irksome nonetheless."
3877,Nael K.,"November 29, 2013",5,"Beautiful, fun way to eat up all your news Flipboard started out on the Samsung phones as a new way to read the news but has grown into a universally acclaimed way to read the news. I love it on the iPad especially because it relies on glorious high def thumbnails to present you news articles and topics. It runs smooth fast and has many providers supporting it nowadays. Definitely give it a try, it looks beautiful and I guarantee it will provide you with reads on all aspects of your life!"
3878,Master_p_Cortes,"December 21, 2015",5,"Articles are a disaster I've been using Flipboard for a couple of years now, and after the last couple of updates this app has kind of become a train wreck."

3880,JCat56,"August 16, 2010",5,"Stunning w/Growing Pains The way it aggregates information is amazing- really a dazzling way to read info and see pics from some of your favorite sites. The Facebook section, however, lags behind in what seems like a day's worth of information. If you want to see the most current info on your facebook feed, you best use your computer, because it won't show in flipboard for hours. It also needs to expand to allow more than nine sites. Super potential after needed tweaks!"
3881,Tony30000,"April 24, 2011",5,"A little suggestion Really enjoy this app. I feel there is still some little thing you can improve. For example, every time you open an article, there is a ""close"" button on the top left side. Every time you have to move your hand a long way to click that button to close the opened article. A better way would be to double click anywhere in the article to directly return the previous window.  Keep up the good work!"
3882,CometWaves,"July 9, 2011",5,"fabulous I really didn't understand why this App was so praised, I mean it is basically just an RSS reader. My relatives suggested it and I have to say it is FABULOUS! I find this App really compliments the iPad, viewing news and FB updates is such a relaxing experience, reads like a printed magazine. "
3883,Ollie What,"December 21, 2011",5,"Goodbye FB app! Finally. Something that is intuitive and can do what I need it to do. It's fun and the flipping doesn't get old. This is what mobile social media has always needed to be. I've deleted that awful FB app. Sure, I won't get notifications, but I won't need them cause I will see the comments from how much I use Flipboard. It's so simple and incorporates the necessities and improves with use. To the creators, you are what we as mobile social app users have be begging for. I thank you. Oh. Please don't mess it up."
3884,Kenderdine,"December 26, 2011",5,"Five star for a reason You'll see all five star reviews because this app really is the most beautiful and best made for social networking. Integrates your twitter and Facebook accounts for viewing and posting and gives you news, videos and stories relating to you and also makes those easy for sharing. #1 app I use and always finding new and interesting stories. Again, beatify app for viewing your social networks. All iPad users is a must have. Will change your world!! :)"
3885,RobA1701,"March 1, 2012",5,"No other reader holds a candle to it! I cannot say enough good things about Flipboard! It has to be experienced to be believed. It turns newsfeeds into easy to navigate, easy to read, and easy to share digital magazines. I read more, have access to a wide breadth of news and articles, and have fun using it. So simple. So brilliant. Bravo! The latest updates have made it even better! These folks are amazing. There is no better way to read newsfeeds, Facebook or Twitter. Must have app for all iOS users!"
3886,Jerry@cali,"November 17, 2015",5,"New release removed key features When sharing stories via text, this app used to include a nice picture of the story and a nicer description of the story. This is all gone in this new release and a step backwards- I enjoyed using this feature. Now the app by default wants the user to send an email and if a text is selected, there's no pictures and the description of the story is missing.  I sure hope they bring this feature back!!"
3887,VDO Ed8r,"December 11, 2015",1,"Zite simplicity was its best attribute Simple to use and navigate. Just another case of a CEO putting profit before its users. Flipboard obviously offered Zite CEO a ton of money because he had something that worked and worked well. A genuine quality product that did what it was suppose to. Not fancy or flashy, but it worked. He took the money/merger, never considering how it affected the people that made it the successful app it had become. Zite CEO, you had something great but you weren't content with a great app, you instead took the pile of cash. You are a great example of what is wrong with the tech industry and why it will all eventually fail... Greed. You had a quality app with loyal users but you throw that away. Congrats. Enjoy your latte."
3888,Umyup,"January 20, 2016",5,"The more I read reviews the more I'm bummed I really like flipboard. I think it's intuitive and has an enjoyable interface, I learn a lot from the articles. It makes me wish flipboard had kept the two products separate and then used the data to improve the experience, perhaps migrating certain desirable features between the two. But instead there's a whole bunch of people on both sides who don't want anything to change. It's a major bummer"

It seems consciously designed with what the iPad would actually be used for. . . finding interesting, informative content and assembling it all in a readable, accessible format.  I love how they have added new content.  I would like to have a ""read it later"" category that I could send the good stuff too for later, and some easier way of organizing the content squares, but overall its great."

I've found a number of different content providers to enjoy that I never would have thought to try the old way!  Also so many of my favorites now have a nice home on the ""red ribbon,"" that now I can remove them from my favorites to add more customized favorites to my now more than adequate two pages!  Thank you so much for the best ""killer app,"" for the iPad!"
3892,Gemcity,"December 12, 2011",5,Wonderful I don't know if I've ever reviewed an app before. That's just how much I love this app. It's intuitive and stylish. It's clean and useful. It's just wonderful. 
3893,DollyManalo,"March 26, 2012",5,Awesome app and it's free!:) I checked out this app after Stana Katic (Castle) mentioned it in an article published by USA Today and I'm amazed by it. I chosed the categories which I liked and the articles and pictures loads so fast even in my first generation ipad and I'm only using 3G internet with AT&T.
3894,ericpfisher,"April 6, 2012",5,"Best way to get news. I check it every morning, more specifically for gaming news. As with all news, some articles I pass on by, but flipboard makes it easy to see what news is out there, then pick what I want to dive into. Awesome, awesome app. Can be a resource hog depending on the content of the news page, so be ready to put up with a crash or two. However, with how quickly you'll be going between articles, it won't take away from the experience."

The logic was since I was always in Outlook anyway, it was easier to read there.  A colleague convinced me to try Flipboard and I was almost instantly hooked.  Flipboard is an outstanding way to read feeds (and other things) on the iPad.  I can easily skim over the headlines, tap on the articles I want to read and easily pull up the original articles if I want to see even more.  For me, this is a must have iPad app!"
3897,Alaskanhuskie2,"April 3, 2014",5,"Excellent Reading App I love that this app pulls reading articles across services together into one app.  Frankly this is what Facebook should look like and operate like on my iphone and ipad.  I love the old concept of turning a page like a magazine and not the scroll method.  The ease of reading articles and sharing them is really nice as well.  I love that videos can be in articles as well and viewed in the app, which makes the reading and viewing experience one smooth operation.  Very nicely made app."
3898,CKoppStudios,"April 3, 2015",4,"Easy to navigate, not necessarily news The app works well and has some very interesting articles, but at the rate of about one a day (depending on the categories you choose). It is quick to scroll though though, which helps to find the articles you may actually be interested a little faster. I wish you could share things in a better way, not all articles have the same social media share options. Overall though a good app, well organized and certainly easy to use."
3899,cprigge,"April 14, 2015",5,"Simply the best. Flipboard has been a staple of my mobile news sources for quite some time now. Always an easy way to see what I want to see and all of it in one place. It does branch out from many sources to prevent that microscope effect of only receiving news and information from one source. But I often was annoyed that I often saw ""news"" from Fox News or the blaze. Finally I can turn these off and retain other reputable sources for news. Keep up the good work!"
3900,JL the Rhaps User,"July 28, 2010",5,"I Like It First of all, I understand a few seconds of frustration when you download an app and it doesn't work like intended ... But to get angry and nasty about it? That's just silly and wreaks of entitlement ... besides, it's free for goodness sakes! Just go about your life and eventually you'll get your email notice like I did."
3901,Bestonia,"March 19, 2014",2,"Useless cover stories Loved this app, but after the last update they messed with how cover stories worked and completely ruined the experience. Before it was a selection of top stories from all your feeds put randomly together so you in effect had a magazine of all your favourite stuff mixed together. Now it's just a useless sequential list of the first stories for each of your feeds in order. So if Facebook is your 10th feed then you will have to scroll through 10 sets of stories from other feeds before seeing anything from Facebook. "

I'm not going to buy any of that crap anyway, so I can glance at a pretty picture of an automobile and continue reading. The ads on Flipboard have changed to grotesque images with idiotic claims. No one who has the minimum required brainpower to operate an iPhone would possibly believe the claims these ads make, or that the kind and generous people behind the ads are anxious to help you solve all your financial, social, and emotional problems with just one click. If Flipboard were to err in showing me an ad for a car I would never buy, whatever. If Flipboard is going to call me an idiot, then, goodbye. App deleted. There are plenty of other sources of information."

Also, I hate that if I back out of the app to check another app or make a call or whatever, it doesn't hold my place.

The app is also atrocious on anything other than LTE... Which means my commutes every day I'm turning to other sources for my information while Clipboard fails to load. All-in-all, loved it at first, and now I'm just waiting for a better option."
3908,TCBS,"April 18, 2017",5,"Call me a Fan I absolutely love the app for organizing and curating my interests and passions as well as staying on top of news. Whenever I want to know what's happening I just check out my smart magazines where I have feeds auto populated for a certain topic or I look at the Daily Edition where I often find a wide variety of news. A unique way to curate content to include articles, videos, photos, music and probably some other content forms that I'm forgetting or unaware of."
3909,aka Louie Lou,"June 1, 2017",5,"Super informative Flipboard is the greatest app I have on my phone currently. I always tune in and I am certainly happy that the news is updated constantly. I can't keep away! I Love that I can make my own magazines share articles with other users also with other ppl through other ""share"" mediums."
3910,cuezaireekaa,"January 1, 2012",5,"pretty and informative. is there a way to make the cover stories  that you've already read, go away? Like a ""mark as read"" option? I hate flipping through so many pages Just to get back to a spot that I was reading after i back out of a feed. "
3911,Buddhadeuce,"September 21, 2012",4,Great All-in-one app!!! I love this app! I use it for almost everything! I say 'almost' because I would love it even more if I were able to tag my friends in my posts or photos. I'd also like it to send me notifications from different social apps like FB or Twitter. If I had tagging and notifications than I would completely delete those other apps and only use this app for everything. I've customized my Flipboard with everything I read most from News to Sports to Blog pages. Love that feature! This is a MUST app to download!
3912,Happyhanabi,"October 23, 2012",2,"Pretty but Unfunctional I love to interface, but I'm getting progressively more frustrated because Flipboard does not auto-update and delete pages I've already seen. I've just closed and opened it five times, and every time it's shown me the same articles. I have to scroll past 100 articles I've already read to get to new content. Pressing the back button and switching to a different feed doesn't help--when you go back to the original feed it starts you over again with the same old articles. "
3913,AllenQClark,"January 9, 2013",5,"Ingenious An intelligently engineered app that provides a refreshing way to interact with your different social media accounts, as well as specifically the news you're interested in. It's a news outlet that's tailored to what you want to read about, whether it be the scores of last night's game, what your friends had to say about that great party, or the latest scientific discovery and everything in between. It's a free app that I'd gladly pay 5 or 6 dollars for. I'd recommend it to any intelligent iPad owner."
3914,Keepin it realz,"May 21, 2013",4,"Would Be 5 Stars But... ...I cannot do anything but private share from Flipboard to Facebook because it is somehow automatically set to private when on my iPad and iPhone.  I have tried many different things to solve this, including going through settings of the devices and the apps, changing some, reading tips and directions, all to no avail.  It seems like the two apps don't vibe correctly.  It could be my ignorance, but I am fairly tech, app, web, and iOS savvy, and if I can't figure it out, it's too complicated."
3915,sfwrtr,"March 4, 2015",4,"Almost Perfect As a long time user, i find this app to be one I open first or second every day, multiple times a day.  I use the flip-to feature from many platforms and use the iOS app to keep track of favorite blogs and news sites. I very much recommend it. "
3916,Martin1-12,"April 6, 2015",5,"Getting information dynamically This app is really good. Besides give you a chance to read only the subjects you choose it also provides you a dynamic and interactive way to read the articles. It's connected to many others networks and works really faster. It's not a virtual magazine, it's a whole library of magazines that you can read while wait a dish, or in the bus, train, or even in the toilet. I recommended it. Thanks to Flipboard developers!"

Used to be a great app, and maybe I'm just noticing this Now because I haven't been able to use the app in a bit but seriously?!? Who the hell has an article based app sprawl adware crap ads over 1/3 of the the screen making the articles next to Completely unreadable?!? Cmon man... I don't care about the revenue you need to make by people accidentally tapping on close corners (and sometimes not even having the option to close the ad), that's just effing Stupid. Are you for real? What the hell happened to you guys? You not only sold out but you just because as relevant as any other app out there that smears crapware all over the place making it completely unattractive and a hassle to use."
3918,Eirik Iverson,"October 8, 2016",3,"Good, can be even better I'm generally happy with it. Apple News seems to find more NFL articles and do so faster.  Missing is the means to like/dislike articles, and do so for content and topic (e.g., articles with interesting titles but no content to substantiate or very poorly written).  I hate wasting time on ineffective articles. I often mistaken Flipboard and News. I use them both. I find I like Flipboard's curated content, something about the unexpected vs articles that fall within my specified topic areas only. I don't do this on Apple News, but I can't say I rigorously compared this feature."

3920,Charlie__V,"April 20, 2011",5,"Geat app I downloaded this app on a whim.  It was free and I wanted to try something new out. In a very short time it has become my favorite app for just checking the latest news and information on my iPad... Better than CNN, google news, fox news, bbs, etc.  No, it is not as serious about news as the other offerings, but for a quick few minute peek at what is going on in the world, this app is the best I have found.  The user interface is intuitive and smart.  Very nice app."
3921,kidkong,"May 10, 2011",5,"Useful and IPad friendly I am not one to replace familiar programs with new ones, however, this program is useful. Some of my favorite rss feeds from google reader have now turned from a half sentence notice to a full article."
3922,bstjohn,"June 19, 2011",5,"Elegant social integration via magazine interface This app has provided me with a great view and new perspective of what and how social media should operate. The interface is gorgeous and intuitive. You can Tweet, Like, Share, etc all from this app. Linked materials (video, pics) are seamlessly presented either in a browser or e-reader format/view. Lastly, this app has many other integration points and news feed options."
3923,APL Newb,"December 8, 2011",5,"Ask and ye shall receive... No more complaints. Everything is as it should be. The amazing reason experience on the iPad is now available on the iPhone.

3924,javellar,"March 13, 2012",5,Best app ever! The default setup is great by itself but being able to setup all the custom topics takes it to another level!  If you are looking for an rss reader try this.  If your looking for a better way to manage you social media try this.  If you are looking for a way to make your rss feeds more social then try this.   The have even made adjustment base the device.... Its functional just as much on an I phone as it is on the iPad and I Can't wait to try this on the ipad3!
3925,Jayverni,"May 1, 2012",1,"App keeps shutting down For the last two months or so, this app has consistently closed down just after opening the full story. When I reopen the app, it asks me to send a report of the crash, which I have done every time, usually three or four times a day before I get fed up and stop trying. I was waiting to see if there would be an update, but I am tired of waiting. It is incredibly frustrating and I have had enough. I will now not even open this app to attempt to read a story. It is a great interface, and wonderful sharing capabilities, but if I can't even read the article, those facts are irrelevant. Fix it or don't, I'm done and will no longer be using this useless but pretty app."
3926,Bob Ktown,"February 20, 2015",5,Love the app but... This would be a great app but for two shortcomings. 
3927,NVR2L869,"September 18, 2016",5,"Excellent App Besides having a huge variety of topics to choose from one of its best features is that the news articles update very frequently, far more often than CNN or Politico. I use it as my ""fill-in news app"" while I wait for my other news apps to update with fresh news. It also carries topics outside of news for a wide variety of interests such as cooking, specialty recipes for crockpots, science, philosophy, religion and literally dozens to hundreds of other topics."
3928,elymoth,"October 7, 2016",3,"Better than buying a paper every day Every time I open Flipboard, it brings me news stories and articles that's different and better than whatever is in regular circulation. The article variety is customizable to my preference. It's easy to navigate, so I always know where I am and how to get back to the main headline page. I enjoy the stories in literature, technology and science. These days, I'm compiling travel stories into my own homemade magazine, another option with Flipboard. Sharing content on Facebook is easy. Flipboard is fun to read, save some favorites and share."
3929,Dom Clayton,"November 17, 2016",5,"Please fix The app is broken. I don't mind the ads but I do miss the flip within each article. I hate how most articles leads you to a slideshow. Please avoid those crappy articles. Also when I get to a certain point, the app will not let me flip anymore. I used to be able to keep flipping until my little heart is content. Now it's very boring. I have over 50 Categories as well and it still stops at about 10-20 flips. Also the app crashes CONSTANTLY"
3930,rcymozart,"March 28, 2013",4,"Excellent News Reader/Publisher, Needs Expanded Sharing The only thing this app is missing is integration with Evernote as a Read Later style service. Otherwise, this is a blissful way to aggregate multiple news sources into one place."
3931,Sawyer917,"January 4, 2014",5,"Love Flipboard. Read it every day faithfully. I have been reading Flipboard for over a year and always have found it interesting and updated. I like the variety, the speed, and the portability from my IPad , my Kindle Fire HdX, my smartphone, and even my laptop. There seems to be a strong focus from the developers to keep it cutting edge and easy to use. Also it never crashes, survives any updates effortlessly, and is so well  worth the time. Highly recommend."

You can now give thumbs up or down to an article, select contextual themes, and otherwise fine tune the preferences. It's about time. Tho I could still complain about extra button pushes (in Zite you could like or unlike content directly from the layout view) customizability is key and right now Flipboard is killing Apple news (no show more/ show less and no muting features)."

3936,wiiteacher,"November 28, 2015",1,"Farewell Zite Killing Zite is a bad move on your part. It remains the best news aggregator by far. No matter how I customize Flipboard, you deliver only stories I already have seen via other social media. Zite always gave me more. I don't want to read a ""magazine"" created by some other user. I want news that is relevant to me. I realize you are trying to be a social news app. Do your users really want that? "
3937,Biohazardouswaste2050,"December 10, 2015",3,"Not quite worth it Its clunky interface has left me disappointed. It looks beautiful. However, the interface is sorely lacking. I want a list of articles that are tailored to my interests. I don't want to just look into each category I am interested in. I have many interests and this is time consuming. It should take my interests and give me a variety of articles. It should pick for me, without me having to dig deeper. Zite did this well and also allowed me to dig deeper if I wanted to. The important thing was that I didn't have to. I won't be using this app. It isn't worth the effort."
3938,rat_a_tat_NAT,"January 20, 2016",5,"Great way to catch the news you are interested in! I enjoy the magazine format and the way Flipboard integrates magazines I choose, topics I follow and my Instagram feed --- like a magazine, easy to browse, and a way to catch things of interest that I might miss even though I have the individual items elsewhere.  I think it a very good solution for covering a lot of ground while being busy.  I find it entertaining to open Flipboard and enjoy it as a browsing experience too."
3939,Jeu537,"March 1, 2016",5,"Outstanding! The best news aggregator magazine. Beautiful interface with option to save articles within the app( or to Instapper or Pocket). Easy to share articles and a pleasure to read as you "" flip"" the pages. I was disappointed to see Zite go but found the transition to Flipboard to be smooth. Flipboard is my go to source for news and information. Keep up the good work. I've shared articles with family and friends and they have become fans of Flipboard."
3940,comeandlisten,"July 29, 2010",5,"Outstanding If you read this you owe it to yourself to ignore the ratings based on impatience and not on the quality of the app itself. This is an amazing and revolutionary app that I am completely in love with. It takes all your interests and Twitter/facebook feeds and turns it into a simple and clean and sexy ""magazine"" that you can flip through. You will say ""wow"" when you try it the first time. It's free which is unbelievable and the wait list is very short (a day or two) and its worth it!"
3941,Lapavoni,"May 17, 2011",5,"Simplify ! It's very easy to clutter your iPad with hundreds of pretty, yet useless apps. Flipboard, however, is one ""must have"" app. Not only does Flipboard accent the awesome utility of the iPad, as many previous reviewers have mentioned, but its layout and consolidation / aggregation of the most useful tools social networking has to offer, is second to no other app I've seen.  The user can add her own content and feeds as well."
3942,Paul 237,"May 21, 2011",4,"Almost perfect! Pros: Beautiful, fun, and functional way to view Facebook, Twitter, and news feeds/blog posts.  Easy and intuitive to use.  Has some cool content absent from other aggregators I've tried."
3943,user961,"July 14, 2011",5,"Beyond Expectations The level of quality of this application is clearly evident. The way the different sections are organized makes it very easy to find the article types you are looking for. The User Interface is overall very intuitive and the ability to explore the links in the articles within the application top off the experience. Easily a 9.5/10, and only -.5 because 10/10 would seem like this is just another hyperbole review."
3944,BrklynDavid,"August 14, 2011",5,"Exactly as promised I can do little more than to repeat the other good reviews: this app has a beautifully designed, thoughtful interface, and it allows you to customize a magazine--or really a digest--where you can find access to many, many different pieces. The use of the ribbon to remember your favorites is a very nice design touch."
3945,Nelson Lack,"August 19, 2011",3,"Beautiful The beauty of this app surpasses many. I believe that if you can keep my eyes interested with elegance, and keep my mind occupied with sensible functionality, then you are worthy of my preoccupation. "

3947,getmilton,"March 20, 2012",5,"SO HAPPY THIS IS ON IPHONE!!! This app should be used as template for other developers for its beauty, simplicity and elegance. It truly deserves a place in a top 10 list. They managed to take ugly UIs on Facebooy, Twitter and Google Reader and present that content in a supremely inviting layout. "
3948,Darth Mallek,"March 28, 2012",5,"Great app! In a world with so many apps and access to all kinds social media, news, lifestyle, and photos, Flipboard provides a beautiful layout to pool and customize quick access to them. Before I discovered Flipboard, I would either be switching between different apps or sifting through my safari bookmarks. Now I have most of the content I read all in one place and the ability to customize it as well. Works wonderful on both the iPad and iPhone."
3949,916253,"November 27, 2012",5,"Great I have been using and supporting flipboard ever since it first came out, and I really think it is the best app out there for delivering news from top providers to anyone who uses it about virtually anything. I also think the inclusion of the social networks is a nice touch. Users can log int their twitter or Facebook accounts quick and easy and read their timeline as if it was another newsfeed. Would I recommend this app to someone else? Absolutely, no questions asked."
3950,Bfrancus,"December 18, 2011",5,App of the year Flipboard is so great that I had to finally write my first review ever on an app.  I follow tech news multiple times throughout each day and I love how I can access and customize my news feeds all in one app. It is super responsive and text is in a format similar to safari's reader feature.  I don't use twitter or Facebook so I am not sure how well it's integrated but I have friends who ditched their native FB and Twitter apps.  Flipboard is so marvelous that is should be incorporated into iOS.
3951,Wirtdog,"December 20, 2011",5,"Awesome app I usually don't take the time to write positive reviews, but after only using this app for two days I felt compelled to share my positive experience. The user interface is simple and connects well to my other social networking accounts. I generally would not have time to find these pieces let alone read them, so it's a great way to stay current and informed.  I highly recommend this app to anyone looking to organize their news and information."
3952,TotallyMusic,"April 14, 2012",4,"Love it but... The back button doesn't always work and it's too small. I have to hit it several times before it takes me back to the previous page. Also, and this is what prompted me to write this review, is that under the news section, where you see a list of the news sources--it doesn't list one conservative source (any that I'm familiar with anyways). But wow--it even includes Al Jazeera news??? Unbelievable. But, aside from that, the app is slick and does a nice job of consolidating all kinds of news and social sources."
3953,StewR,"August 11, 2012",2,"Needs to focus on content more Two stars, it's a beautiful app, but the content handling needs work."
3954,Jgjlrhfdv,"March 16, 2013",5,"Love flipping through my news I like that this can use twitter to bring news articles, I can read some sites that require you to click read more without doing one more click because flipboard has already fetched the article from twitter. I mainly love the flipping animation though. I don't really like scrolling and pagination is kind of boring. This is the only app I've seen so far that allows you to swipe up and down to go through an article."
3955,leonjonathan,"November 21, 2014",1,"Big step backwards Really disappointed with the ""upgrades"". More options=more difficult to get what I want. Layout is less fluid to navigate, which WAS one of major upsides of the app. Black bar at bottom is a distraction. I suggest you place cover stories or daily edition (which is just as nice) back to forefront, without distractions. Also, flipping through topic tiles was easier than scrolling as I knew where to expect a topic relative to screen. Really the best part of this app was being able to digest content in a format that was so great and easy to navigate. Like some else already said, the bright side of this update is that it cures my Flipboard addiction."
3956,CragLife,"March 10, 2016",5,"Great app. Stopped watching TV news. An excellent app that is more addicting than Facebook for ""news junkies."" I manage multiple ""magazines"" for my business, global awareness, travel plans, and more. It's a great app if you know how you want to use it and leverage the information for a number of reasons. Why go out and search for stories all day when you can have those stories delivered straight to you via Flipboard? If you love news, this is a must-have app."
3957,100gkljhgdti,"May 15, 2016",5,"What if you could have a magazine just for you All the cute things you might want to read on the web.  All the interesting articles, all the latest cat videos - whatever you want.  You can add things from Safari with a couple of clicks.  You can build your own magazines - like with Pinterest boards, but not just for pictures.  You can follow other people's magazines and let people follow yours - or not. This is my favorite app of all time"

The redesign for version 4.0 was a terrible mistake it could've been executed a lot better. Hopefully you'll redesign again with some more modern design than clunky giant text and giant collection view cells that just fill up the app and make it look clustered, I'm wondering if this app was sold and the new company made terrible design choices? This was easily the nicest app on the App Store for a few years in my opinion"

3962,Tastybread,"July 26, 2010",1,It's a broken service Granted everyone was excited when this app first came out. Truth is I have a feeling that everyone who voted positively for this app are the ones who like to be seen in public flipping through their iPad in public because the only thing that works are the neat-o page flipping animations. 
3963,Colorado-John,"April 16, 2011",4,"Good, could be better Very good App for the iPad that I find useful for quick scan of news, tweets etc that I'm interested in.  What I would like in future edition is a way to configure the twitter section to first give me just the tweets for quick scanning then I can drill in deeper if need be. Same holds true for Facebook."
3964,m34ch,"November 8, 2011",4,Beautiful? Yes! Useful? Well... This is a gorgeous app.  It really takes advantage of the large iPad screen in a way that a lot of apps do not. And I love the newspaper metaphor- the app really sells the concept and it works consistently throughout. 
3965,TheJimJones,"December 13, 2011",5,"Incredible I hardly submit reviews for apps but felt the need to after checking this app out. This app is incredible, you can get Facbook, Twitter, News and pretty much any kind of custom updates you want in one convenient place. Flipboard is very fast and so far consistent, haven't encountered any problems at all. I almost prefer viewing Facebook via Flipboard because it's way more painless than the actual Facebook App, which is garbage. Bottom line: Get this app immediately!"
3966,Mike67run,"December 13, 2016",5,Absolutely great. It's by far my favorite news and information app. I like the way it's laid out I like how easy it is to switch from one topic to the next. I like the fact that you can select on special topics like photography or just Apple products.  Some of the new things have not been better in my opinion. And the advertisements are getting a bit too numerous. I wish there was a pay option that illuminated the advertising.
3967,Intrepidsurfer,"March 4, 2017",2,"Annoying Update For years, Flipboard has been my go-to app for compiling all of my news and information sources into one place. It's awesome. With the new update comes a slick new format that appears to improve the speed and ease of use. HOWEVER, about a quarter of the screen while scrolling through my following tiles is taken up by useless space. I use Flipboard to access news easily. It is frustrating to have so much screen space dedicated to showing me how many people are following me or having a special search bar. If these functions are what most Flipboard users access, then I must be in the minority."

They still haven't fixed the low quality comments issue though. Slightly different from the original but better than everything else I've tried."
3970,MRKP89,"November 13, 2012",4,Quite close to Perfection This app is now where I spend all of my time reading news. The user interface is laid out in gorgeous and efficient tiles (wondering if Windows 8 has anything to do with this). The news also cater to your interest and the app uses your social media connections as one of the news sources.

I have faith that this feature will be added someday;) Thanks for a great experience so far!"

I love the way it displays the content like a magazine, makes it easy to browse and Cover Stories is a great way to mix every thing. That said, after browsing, I have to go directly to the apps like twitter, instagram, cnet, cnn, etc to READ because many of the link in flipboard won't open or won't display correctly. Flipboard has been available for a long time now, and this issues should have been corrected by now."
3976,ThinkArc,"January 19, 2016",5,"Favorite source for in-depth articles I subscribe to a number of news emails and Flipboard is still my favorite source for well-written and in-depth articles from sources that I would not otherwise read.

I also enjoy the interface and enjoy flipping through the news."

When I transferred my preferences over my news feed changed for the worse, with articles about faith and spirituality with an atheist perspective gave way to new age claptrap. I thought it would improve over time maybe flipboard would have the thumbs down thing that Zite had to properly curate my articles. This app is still the best news aggregator app out there, I just wish it was as good as Zite was before flipboard took them over."

I can open the article in Safari and select reader view... but this extra step is clunky. Can't you just tap into the Safari options? That would enable landscape mode also."
3980,Jessppark,"April 24, 2011",4,"Excellent app! This is so far my favorite app. It puts all the sites that I frequently go to in a magazine format. I can even access some news sites that require subscription. However, it does not get 5stars because Facebook and twitter are not integrated so well.  it mainly collects the links people post on Facebook and doesn't cover a whole lot of comments, convo, etc. But that shouldn't be a problem at all since I can use other apps for that. This mainly puts all the sites that I go to together in a very nice format that I really like."
3981,Snarshad,"July 2, 2011",5,"My favorite iPad app This turns the tedious task of catching up on social life and news feeds into a beautiful, relaxing, head back task."
3982,LiquidPhire,"December 7, 2011",2,Falls Short First let me preface that this review pertains solely to the new iPhone version of the app. I've used the iPad version for quite some time and have rated it at 5 stars from the get go. 
3983,ElwoodJD,"January 13, 2012",5,"Fantastic for Google, Facebook, Twitter Title says it all, I use this for Google Reader, Facebook, and Twitter mostly, and it syncs to all of them perfectly. Highly organized layout, easy to reply, retweet, forward,etc. even marks the articles from reader as read so that they don't keep appearing.  Ignore the one-star reviews about content not updating. They clearly haven't set their settings properly. I haven't tried the pre loaded content, but adding my own has been easy."
3984,primesz,"March 12, 2012",5,"One of my favorite news apps This by far is one of my favorite apps. It sorts the news feeds that I want to keep up with in one centralized location. It makes articles easier to read and adds in a different level of interactivity other than scrolling up and down. Although some news feed don't take advantage of the way flipboard let's you read their articles, I find that most of my favorite sites allow for it. Really great app!"
3985,JohnTC78,"March 19, 2012",4,Great app...one request I can't believe I haven't seen this app before...I love being able to flip through all the social media and news venues in one app. Huge time saver and then some.  Top-notch design and implementation. 
3986,Electr0rganic,"May 23, 2012",5,"Definitely one of the greats Flipboard is a great way to catch up on current events, learn something new, and check all of your social networks all in one great app. I was a little hesitant at first but have come to love it and use it hand in hand with Pocket, another app that lets me store all the articles I wanna read later straight from FB. This app also introduced me to tons of great places to read and find out new and exciting things. I don't know how I ever survived without it."
3987,Wayne H...,"May 25, 2016",1,"Filters content towards left leaning material I noticed a clear change in the content of my feeds once I was forced to switch from Zite to Flipboard. One topic I used to enjoy reading about was guns... primarily apolitical gun model reviews and news. Once Flipboard took over though, most of what I was shown was left leaning political views on gun ownership and gun control. I tried customizing my preferences to be shown more of what I was interested in, but it didn't work. Leftist material continued to dominate my feed on this and most other topics I preferred. I even put in the names of specific blogs I used to read through Zite, but they seemed to be restricted on Flipboard. I really wanted to like this app, but I'm done. Erasing today."
3988,Waterlizzel,"July 15, 2016",5,"Ultimate Source for News Without cable, this is the best way to get all your news - efficiently and in a visually elegant presentation. Tune it to get opposing viewpoints or just what you want to see, as you like. Many choices of sources and topics to follow, including independent blogs, mean that you can find most of your updates all in one place."
3989,JobsFan999,"March 14, 2017",5,The worst version ! This app is literally unusable after the upgrade. Advertisements every page !!! I will never use it again. 
3990,Gdawg82,"November 4, 2013",5,Great app. Ill always use it. This app was a great find years ago and I still love it. Those of you rating it 1 star due to slow loading or glitches with the new version dont seem to understand that it happens sometimes and the developers are very good about fixes. Having to sign up isn't a big deal either. They don't ask for anything and its nice to save your favorite articles and synch between devices. I'll always recommend it.
3991,ayampols,"November 8, 2013",3,"Overhyped A somewhat overhyped news reader. Some feeds look good, but for most the text gets cut off after a paragraph or two, forcing one to open it in the built-in web browser or in Safari. What’s the point? Apps like Safari or Instapaper have been able to display an entire, even multi-page article cleanly and in full for quite a while, but Instapaper still can’t do this. Other annoyances (like the extremely difficult-to-use mechanism to re-arrange main screen icons) make this a reader that I imagine, and hope, will be surpassed by competition."
3992,jj12335678910,"July 13, 2014",5,"Excellent App This app is perfect to easily catch up on news, sports, business, travel or anything else that catches your eye. It has a user friendly feel and the magazine ""flip"" display of different stories is a great touch. You can follow your favorite news and magazine sources and receive updates custom to what you want to see. Overall this app is the best way to stay up-to-date on all the latest stories. Highly recommended."
3993,monkeypox,"November 4, 2014",2,"now yet another ""social"" news outlet Not too long ago, flipboard used to be THE go-to concise feed of your interests. But with this latest update, all of the once-familiar content has been reorganized in the hope of becoming yet another social outlet, much like TuneIn's recent (disastrous) releases. It's not as if there were some gaping hole that users were clamoring to fill. Why not fix some of the more useful items instead, like the excessive disk space usage?"
3994,8BitKing,"June 25, 2015",3,"Could be more accurate... Used to use flip board a lot on Samsung phones so I got it on my new iPhone. I like the app. it's an easy way to quickly catch up on news when on the go. The only downside is that many topics I follow don't provide a great variety and range of articles (I.e. science topic often has atheist oriented articles, but not all scientists are atheists lol). Does get a little annoying after a while of following and unfollowing topics just to find my perfect fit. I really wish it was easier so i wouldn't have to spend so much time searching. Id rather be reading!"
3995,CorSully1,"July 25, 2015",5,"Flipboard=interesting I enjoy FlipBoard because it breaks down areas of interest into categories, that way you can go directly to what interests you.  Look up Technology and find out what's going on with Apple.  Any thing that peaks your interest is right there.  With my busy schedule, I don't have time to filter through articles that don't interest me.  So thanks to FlipBoard my life is easy and interesting.  Word of the day ""interesting"". You'll find it in FlipBoard"
3996,the Jay-ster,"September 15, 2015",5,"My most used app I love flipboard. It has replaced my other time wasting apps; you know, the ones you go to when you're waiting in line or have five minutes to kill. But rather than playing angry birds, I'm reading interesting, relevant news articles or learning more about the things I love. It's been fascinating to see how well flipboard has learned my likes and interests. Sometimes with articles that match two or three things I'm interested in."
3997,Ashraf Hameed,"October 5, 2015",5,"The best in it's category I love the idea of flipping through articles more than scrolling. Articles load fast, fresh content are always there, it always shows content relative to what I am following. It's far better than buzzfeed and other similar apps, also I tried to use Apple news since I prefer built in app but it was horrible and always showed unrelated content and was slow, I immediately switched back to Flipboard."
3998,Cybernettr,"October 21, 2015",5,"Better range of topics than Apple News Flipboard still has a lot more available interests than Apple news, allowing you to fine-tune your newsfeed and make it a lot more personalized to you than Apple news can. Both services have their uses, but I don't see Flipboard going away anytime soon. "
3999,JrodFrank,"January 20, 2016",5,"Great app, gets better as you use it! I started using Flipboard a few months ago and was/still am a little overwhelmed at the sheer amount of categories that you can follow. The great thing about this app is that it learns your preferences as you go if you are just willing to take the time to tell it when you like or don't like articles. Fast forward to now, it is rare that I find an article on my cover stories that isn't tight up my alley!"
4000,TheZenMonkey,"December 7, 2011",5,"What iOS was made for I've seen this on the iPad, and wasn't sure how it would transfer to the phone. Turns out, beautifully. I have had no technical problems. The interface is intuitive and very speedy. If you're in the mood to browse the links in your Twitter feed, this beats the Twitter app all to ground. News, art, book, tech, design junkies -- and plenty of other kinds -- need to have this on your phone, unless you like it better on your iPad. I get that. :-)"
4001,Zaidhaft,"December 8, 2011",5,"Great app! Need fix? Not anymore! I've been using flipboard on my ipad for a while. Yesterday, I decided to download the new iphone version, as well as performing the update of the ipad version. Now the app only works on the iphone! On the ipad, it keeps saying I have to check my internet connection, altough every other app recognizes it!"
4002,Nanakitteh,"March 12, 2012",5,"Great app It's a little complicated to set up at first but is easy once you get started. It has a great visual appeal for reading your news, blogs, magazines and Twitter account. My only complaint is that you are limited to the number of sites you can see on the flip pages -- I want more pages! Seriously though you get four pages showing up to 6 or 8 sites and if you have more, they are accessible on a list page behind the flip pages."
4003,MDC77,"March 18, 2012",5,"iPhone to iPad I've had this on the iPhone for quite some time. It's a well put together app that has a huge potential to be the best app for this category. Well then I got the ""new"" iPad and discovered a whole other side of this app. It is THE best app quite frankly I have on either device. I figure anything that can keep me looking for as long as this does in one sitting has the right ingredients for a spectacular recommendation. So there you go, my .02 but I know you'll love it."
4004,tobystereo,"March 19, 2012",5,"The Essential iOS app Flipboard has been the app that in itself made it worth buying the iPad. Now it has come to the iPhone/iPod touch and doesn't disappoint. Whether it is curated content, news from twitter and Facebook or my Google Reader RSS subscriptions, there is no other app I need to do my online reading, and there definitely is no other app that does this as beautifully and thoughtfully as Flipboard. This app would be worth some good money, but it is free! Download this app now!"
4005,ThaiTanium44,"April 5, 2012",5,"Awesome News Feed The interfacing is great, very easy to navigate, and the choices of feeds to choose from are pretty diverse and informative. My only problems are some of the articles arent natively compatible with flipboard's design and forces the user to view it in standard format, defeating the purpose of the app. If they added a ""save"" feature that would be excellent; as it is now, the user has to email or share them for preservation. Other than that, the app is phenomenal!"
4006,E15C15,"November 21, 2012",5,"THE News App I love reading my news to keep up to date with things going on all around the world. For that, I would need to go to Fox, CNN, ABC, or Yahoo!. That was too many tabs in my iPad's browser. Flipboard is THE go to app when it comes to the latest news updates and one of the most elegant ways to display my news. This app is just phenomenal in every meaning of the word and my thanks go out to its developers. If you don't have this app already, get it."
4007,blkeagl,"April 28, 2013",2,"Crashy on original iPad This is one of my favorite apps ever, but my star rating has gone down with release after release as it now constantly crashes while reading articles, especially when using the internal browser. When I have to restart an app 2-5 times to read a single article, it's just frustrating. "
4008,Gdawg82,"November 4, 2013",5,Great app. Ill always use it. This app was a great find years ago and I still love it.

4009,matt_zzzzz,"July 31, 2017",5,"My main source of news It's pretty much perfect as a source of news for the things I care about. I switched from Reddit being my main source to Flipboard. I get more consistently high quality articles without the juvenile reddit snark (though Reddit still wins for cat videos and humor). However, Flipboard lacks some of the programming communities I'd like to follow, like Functional Programming or React (it's there but missing key articles). I have to look elsewhere for that."
4010,Sparso,"December 1, 2015",5,"Like the app, but... I like the app fine for content but the app does not have the option to increase the font size.  Neither can you option to open the articles in Safari where they could be read with the available reader view there.  The font is just too small to be read comfortably on the IPhone.  Until this is fixed, I'll be getting my news and articles somewhere else."
4011,LaurenEll,"December 6, 2015",5,"Try listening to users - bring back Zite features It's really annoying that after all the reviews - mostly constructive (some rants) that the publishers haven't listened or responded to the Zite users - it was a great, simple to use app - allowed easy sharing, easy browsing, integration with pocket etc.  If they can't bring back the features - at least let us know the silly political debates that went on in the meetings to give us something to be amused by...."

4013,Paul D. Miller,"January 20, 2016",5,"Flipboard Review This is one of my favorite reading Apps. It combines several forms of reading - think of it as a visual RSS feed combined with any media online, and a great way to share and filter for content that you find online. We all skim and browse themes and topics online, this App just lets you pull them all together in one place. Like Evernote, RSS, Google Keep, and other Apps that take your reading to the next level. Great for micro blogging as well. One of my favorite Apps."
4014,AllBizAllBiz,"March 26, 2016",5,"Great Articles Not sure what issues have been with others, but I absolutely love this app...I am a reading junkie and I love all types of news genres and this app provides that. I have spent the last year trying different news apps and end up deleting them all...they were terrible in so many ways..even the newsstand is horrible. But this app is really great and all that I need. I love it...even the few crashes, it's still worth it....so far :)"
4015,SongDuck™,"March 31, 2016",5,"Great Personal News App I started using Flipboard about 2 weeks ago & already it has become my go to app for articles about topics I am interested in. 'Flipping' from page to page is very easy and lots of fun. The more I use Flipboard the more I get articles I like and links to other topics I might want to follow. Zite was my news aggregator of choice, but it no longer exists. I'm not upset about the demise of Zite now that I found Flipboard. Highly recommend."
4016,T-Rod05,"June 16, 2016",5,"My favorite news site, except for Pop-up ads This is my go to site for news, and don't have any complaints,except one small one. Occasionally I open a page, and I'll get pop-up ads that just take over to where I can't even get back to the article. I just have to flip on to the next stories. Would love an adblocker built in. Still a great app though. It only happens to me like maybe 1 out of every 20 stories."
4017,heathrulez,"June 22, 2016",3,"Nail in the Coffin I rarely ever use this app anymore. I find Facebook is a much better news source and their Paper app mimics the magazine style enough. Flipboard had just become too convoluted between your saved articles and sites you follow and then the featured curated articles all mixing together in a rather unintuitive design. But the last straw is now you flipboard is featuring articles you have to have paid subscriptions to read, like the Wall Street Journal, and even send push notifications for these incomplete articles. I know you gotta make money, still not cool."
4018,czr01,"August 27, 2016",5,"Too Many Obtrusive Ads The ads are ridiculous! There are articles that were prepped by the app and those are okay. But there are a lot of articles where the app is merely serving as a browser and you are actually looking at the website. Those have way to many ads--big ads in the middle if the article, floating ads that cover a big part if the page, sponsored links. "
4019,dslarsen,"March 14, 2017",1,"Latest Update Totally Broken This was one of a handful of apps I used every day, but the latest update renders it totally useless. I can't get to the stuff I have been using all this time, and it doesn't actually present "
4020,WaltzP,"April 2, 2012",5,Simply Great I've used flipboard for two days now and it's absolutely stunning. It preloads key pictures and text and allows me to easily flip through my favorite magazines and things like Facebook. The navigation is seamless and it works equally well in portrait or landscape. Before using this my favorite was pulse for when I'm reading stories but I like this even better because it gathers a greater amount of text for previewing the story and saves me a lot of time.
4021,LeenerAnn,"April 25, 2012",4,Great App! What a wonderful app to be able to browse through so  many articles as well as my friends blogs that I subscribe to!
4022,ktwrenn,"July 24, 2012",4,"Love this. A few add ons would be great but definitely worth a look The more I use this app the more I enjoy it. I thought it was really cool when I first synced everything to it, but I continue to use it and discover new functionality. I wish you could use it to post directly to social media though instead of having to share posts and that's it. But other than that this app is fantastic. It's great for podcasts too. I just figured out that you can run them in the background like the music app."
4023,desertflower01,"August 8, 2012",5,"Content changes I love this app and use it daily. But, the recent update seemed to downgrade content in the pre-defined categories. The photos from the photos category changed from top quality content to some face book account that posts precious animal pictures. That has been a let down and i want the old sources back. I can do that with a little work. You can't beat this app for reading your own custom feeds in a visually pleasing way."
4024,ThPeine,"June 30, 2013",5,Great app to stay up-to-date on anything news I use this app every day and it has quite literally replaced my newspaper. The only drawback is the limitation on tiles it allows the user to have. Adding and deleting content could be a bit easier as well. Then again they will save all my Google Reader feeds once that service will be discontinued (tomorrow). All in all this is a great app I don't want to do without anymore. Keep up the great work Flipboard!
4025,bleedmaizenblue,"June 29, 2014",4,"The best but one huge flaw This is the best, hands down news, social, etc information app available but there is one huge flaw.  Right now you can only have four main pages before clicking the more button. It doesn't make sense why you can just keep flipping down and get all your feeds and tiles of info.  I think they know this because if I remember right it started with 2 pages, then 3 now 4. Hopefully this will be updated soon but either way it's still the best."
4026,jrussellpowell,"December 20, 2014",1,Absolute Garbage With Sparkles & Glitter Absolute garbage this app. Their designers clearly do not understand that good design means it is attractive AND functional. They are also seemingly unable to comprehend that good design in an app does not require skeuomorphic elements to remind you of its analogue equivalent. 
4027,ZotjeF,"May 12, 2015",4,Great app Based on all these negative reviews you would think this is an awful app. I love it. Having the option to organize all my newsfeeds and save my interests in magazines is amazing. The search feature is also great to find articles on a specific topic.
4028,Radtads,"September 19, 2015",3,"Other than video/embedded content problems... Other than video/ embedded content problems, I love this app. flipboard, PLEASE fix this! Videos don't appear in so many stories where they're supposed to be embedded. And when they do appear (rarely!), they're often in the wrong place in the article. PLEASE FIX THIS! Love flipboard but won't keep using it if embedded content keeps getting left out. I don't have that problem w feedly... If this issue were to be fixed, this review would be an easy five stars, esp. with the like/comment/more like this/flip to archive features!"
4029,Bcjonesnyc,"November 24, 2015",1,"What's the opposite of progress? Being forced to use this app since they acquired Zite, the best news app out there. This app is far less efficient. It's obsessed with the visual, making summaries ridiculously large so you only get a few on a page. There is then the cheesy flipping metaphor, which apparently impressed some vc that missed paper magazines. It's the type of thing you can turn off on your kindle after a day of humoring the gimmick. And I'll also very much miss the ""most read"", which brought a current of stuff by that I never would have ended up on based on my own recs. I'm afraid I'll have to punt this when they shut down Zite and go on the hunt for a serious news app."

4033,Brett Sly,"May 29, 2011",4,I want it all... I really enjoy this app. It makes tasks like Facebook a joy to actually use. I love the interface and how everything is laid out. I love the content and wealth of different flipbooks there are. Sadly my only complaint is that I want more than two pages to put flipbooks on. I love knowledge and hate having to remove a flipbook I like to make room for another one I like because I only have two pages to put them on. I want enough pages to have them all! Other than that you have made a fantastic app!

4036,seaLoves_,"October 27, 2011",5,Love the layout! I love the layout and easy navigation of Flipboard. Didn't care so much for the Facebook and Twitter interface as it made links and page posts primetime and I'm on Facebook to see what my friends are up to and not necessarily to read articles. This is purely personal preference. On Flipboard I added my favorite news magazines and music blogs among others and the format is just so much more readable and palatable than going directly to these sites. Love it. Thank you!!
4037,mrobatres,"December 12, 2011",5,Incredible I have owned a iPad for a very long time I have lot and lots of apps this is my first review ever I had to say something but this app. I cannot believe this app is free if you are on facebook and twitter all the time like me you will love this app the layout everything is perfect I'm a hard person to impress and I cannot find something that I hate about this app grab it wile it's free the dev could make billions if he decided to charge for it grab it's now stop reading this go go go....

The new update took a few days to get used to but in no way did it diminish the core functionality of the app. If you download it - just take your time to actually set it up so that it suits your interests. The bad reviews on here are probably from those geriatric smartphone users who can't handle any type of change. Time for them to get a Jitterbug...
4040,bdp1975,"June 17, 2014",5,"Best app for news and information. I couldn't be more pleased with this app. I'm a news junkie, but I only want desire specific topics. Flipboard filters out the information that doesn't interest. As icing on the cake, in addition to the credible media giants, the app provides me with quality media sources I may not have ever given much attention to. Finally, I'm able to create my own genres so that I can find unique, niche information relevant to my career."
4041,Ksrisha,"August 7, 2014",5,"It's an amazing app I love this app all the way it is designed and convenient for any one to use it easily. This is something users look for to have news, entertainment, business , sport, fashion, style, photography and all kind of magazines at one place with easy access. It is so easy to go through without any technical knowledge. Thanks to the developers and team who brought up such idea and implementation for common people to use with ease. Love it."

Some of the changes have been great some I could do without.  I really like the flipping and the mix of categorical material and specific source material.  I want Flipboard to make money but the popup ads are really obnoxious.  They are defeating the purpose.  I get made at the advertiser and also don't want to bother with the story where these ads are popping up.  I don't mind ads in the content but not the overbearing popup ads.

Well this is it great app that makes my ipad pro look boss. I love that in the morning before work I open my Flipboard scroll through the mental floss open the mag and flip over 25 pages and now if I just close the app I will now be able to read those 25 pages offline on the bus
4046,MacSince86,"February 12, 2016",2,"Flawed Implementation of a Good Idea The great idea behind Flipboard is a sort of democratization of the news. But its implementation needs more thought. It tries to give users a degree of control over what news topics they receive, but these controls are too ham-handed. The story listings are often highly repetitive. Not long ago, Flipboard acquired another similar company called Zite. The implementation at Zite was much better and the app was easier to fine tune. Sadly Flipboard shut Zite down and we are left with this. I've been experimenting with Apple's news service, but that has issues too. Still waiting for a good news service app."
4047,gcbeavis,"February 12, 2016",5,"My primary news source when traveling I don't subscribe to television, so Flipboard along with NPR apps are how I stay informed.  I've been using this app for at least two years now, and find that I'm generally ahead of of my television watching brethren at being informed.  I also took the time to indicate my areas of interest when I first set up this app and have been rewarded with a much wider range of information than I would ever find on television.  Kudos!"
4048,Souixzq,"March 1, 2016",5,"Great app! I'd you love to be able to read the news but are tired of seeing a bunch of nonsense, then flip board is for you. I love the ability to pick and choose the topics I want to see, and flip through the titles to choose the stories I want to read. Great when you have a little time and want to filter your reads, but with so much available, there is much to read if you choose to spend more time getting caught up."
4049,TheChowdery,"June 17, 2016",4,"My most used app Love it. My most used iOS app for the past couple of years. Love combining my various feeds into a magazine view that's easy to share with friends and subscribers. Four star because it. Reds some more robust curation featured for magazines shared with other contributors. For example, if I post five articles thematically (five game articles, five tech articles, and then five movie articles) and then a contributor posts a duplicate... That breaks my curation and requires me to do a LOT of finagling to re-curate. But other than that, it's a great app!"
4050,gddosd,"May 16, 2011",5,"Wonderful and original app I love using this app as my one-stop source of news and information. This is the first thing I open every morning when I get up while I am drinking my coffee. It's a beautiful way to view Facebook and Twitter and a convenient way to catch up on the news from overnight. You can even share links to Facebook, email and twitter from inside flipboard without having to leave the app or do a bunch of logins. I absolutely love this app."
4051,John R Anthony,"December 7, 2011",5,"Slow start, but only because it's so awesome. A new app not working because so many people are trying to use it says a lot. While it can be easy to focus on it not working, you have to give credit to the reason. This app is amazing. It's my favorite app on the phone. It offers news, entertainment, reading, Facebook, Twitter, and even recipes. It's like six apps in one beautiful, easy to use format. It's no wonder so many people backlogged the servers on its debut."
4052,steveb57nab,"February 10, 2012",4,"One of the best I've seen I like this app. It puts so much information at my fingertips and in a very organized fashion. My one criticism is that when I put a term in the search bar I get this list of results that I assume has my term contained within, however when I click on the a link I have no idea where within that link my term is. If I click on an rss feed that has a slew of articles, I don't know where my article is that contained my search term. If they could fix that, I wouldn't have a single complaint."
4053,alecmeyerhoff,"March 11, 2012",5,"Best informational App Ever I hate watching the news, there are segments which are really boron and it never shows the news that you want to see. With flipboard, you get the news quick and you get to see exactly what you want to see. An best of all, you can also get twitter feeds, and many other subject based feeds that you really want to read about, so youre never stuck with just depressing news like most of the media delivers these days."
4054,NittanyGP,"March 23, 2012",5,"Just amazing. I've been looking for a way to easily manage the various RSS feeds I'm subscribed to. Flipboard not only organizes my content beautifully, it does so in a way that makes flipping through a list of feeds engaging and fun. The interface intuitively lends itself to finding articles that I really care about, and I'm getting more out of the content than I ever have before. It's quickly become one of those tools that I can't imagine life without."
4055,riptiderider,"June 15, 2013",5,"Easy to use and different news perspective I've rated this app 5 stars for 2 major reasons: ease of use and a perspective that differs from the news sources I routinely follow. I appreciate being able to designate both information sources and categories of interest to some extent. Use is simple and intuitive. My one suggestion to improve ease of use is to make the ""refresh"" icon in the lower left corner of the home screen larger or somehow more obvious."
4056,Star BeGlitched,"December 7, 2013",5,"This has always been my #1 iPad app I love Flipboard!!  It is my favorite iPad app and always has been.  Most apps are cool at first but then you inevitably end up getting bored with them.  Flipboard is a must have and something that I use everyday to keep up to date with things I am interested in.  It turns the internet into a beautifully personalized magazine for every user. I recommend this app to all of my friends with iPads.  The iPhone version is great, too."
4057,JMK4944,"December 22, 2015",2,"Flip Board Needs To Improve Topic Searches Improve the topic searches!  For World Rally Championship (all about rally cars) I see political 'rally' articles, a cat that 'rallies' after nearly freezing to death, voters 'rallying' to support a candidate, etc.  The Mustang topic has included numerous articles about the new movie titled ""Mustang"" and articles about people riding a mustang horse, etc.  There are many examples of ridiculously unrelated articles included based on a single search word in many of the categories I have selected.  The search program must be from the mid 1980s."
4058,Joe - xyz123,"January 20, 2016",5,This is what makes an iPad great! What's to say. This app brings together the social media and information feeds in a great layout. I'm not sure if Flipboard  performs the magic of bringing what's important to me or if that is just the power of the sites and feeds which are being presented by Flipboard. I can't recommend it highly enough.  It is an understatement to say that Flipboard is a must have app. A better description would be to say Flipboard is a reason to have an iPad.
4059,Iamno1too,"March 22, 2016",5,"Web Executive Summary of My Many Passions I love Flipboard!!!    Take the time upfront to tag all your passions (I didn't know I had so many) and let Flipboard bring the latest information from the Internet directly to you.   The GUI is unique ,easy and fun to use.   It's worth a try to see if you will enjoy this app as much as I do.   Rarely write reviews but FB has impressed me and I've found that I'm happier with the convenience of this app than without it.   Enjoy."

Rather than trying on different websites I just have to open this app and I get everything at one place. So I'm very pleased with this app. I can't empathizes more on its usability in my life. Because most of the time I would be so swamped by meetings all day that opening a website to read a news would be the last thing in the world I would do. "
4063,Sebastian Huber,"February 1, 2014",5,"Magazine of the XXI century No one reads news papers and magazines from the first to the last page, except time when you are editor in chef. Flipboard makes the news reading pleasure learning your reading habits and topics you're interested in. Best in its own class. The only weak point I see is lack of consistent typography making the streamlined pages look different everytime I flip a page. Inspiration from guys behind Readability warmly welcome."
4064,Ken@Darien,"March 10, 2014",5,"Bad upgrade to cover stories I love flipboard, but I hate the new cover stories format for scanning articles.  Instead of just ""flipping"", now we have to search for good articles by going into different sub-directories.  And what's up with the pictures on the right side?  I don't know what they are referring to and there is no explanation, so now we just have to tap to find out if we even care.   The update is terrible.  Please return it to the old format."

4066,MattitudeMethod,"April 2, 2015",2,"Moving on... For a while Flipboard was THE app for my daily news consumption.  I recently found that using Flipboard blew up my cellular data usage because it auto refreshes ALL news feeds, including pictures/media, every time you open the app or return to the main screen. There was previously an option for this I believe but now it's gone. Anyway, I've moved on to a much more data-light news reader (Circa) and will consider a RSS reader for blogs and other things I like to read. Flipboard needs to condense the content they provide for ease in reading and for cell data usage before I consider to go back."
4067,Mbeccaria,"May 4, 2015",3,"Two click to the article Recently flipboard has made it so that when you click on an interesting article it brings you to a screen that used to show the entire article. Now it shows you another preview screen where you are asked to click again (""read more..."") before you can read the entire article...after it takes time to load it in the browser. Flipboard initial front page is enough to know you want to read the article. Clicking through twice is just an annoyance."
4068,Classclown1123,"September 30, 2015",1,"I miss the old version of Flipboard (iOS 6) I upgraded from an iPod Touch (4th Generation) to an iPod Touch (6th Generation) and I don't like the latest update of Flipboard. First, three magazines I follow doesn't show up on the home page and automatically refresh at the same time when I launch the app. It's just one article that shows up when I open the app. Second, I would like to have a ""Read Later"" option to save an article and read offline. It's not the same anymore. Last but not least, I want to turn off some push notifications but it won't allow me to do so. I can't find that option on my iPod Touch settings as well . I hope you understand."
4069,Ck1232,"October 20, 2015",4,"Great app, not so great community I enjoy the app itself, however there is a lot to be said for its users. I'm not ignorant to the fact that the Internet can be a hateful, dark place, however the racist, bigoted, closed-minded comments that appear on nearly every single article are a lot to contend with even by Internet standards. I'm not sure how Flipboard has managed to concentrate so much hate into one place, but my faith in humanity diminishes a little more every time I read the comments section on a Flipboard article."
4070,Nothinghead,"August 3, 2010",5,"After some stumbles out of the gate this app is indispensable The launch was a disaster, but now that things have been straightened out, this is my favorite iPad app.  It is beautiful, useful, and the app I find myself running more frequently than everything else combined. It has a great visual layout for Twitter and Facebook as wells a number of very good feeds. I would, however, like the ability to have more than 9 sections available on my opening page."
4071,Sara9,"December 2, 2010",5,"The Best I just tried out your new feature and it is the best!!!!  It was wonderful not having to go to the web and I love the fact you can still send an article to ""read it later"".  The only problem I could see is the amount of space given. I use all 21 sections and wanted to add 2 of the new sites and it was hard deciding which ones to delete. The experience is just wonderful. I would love to see more publications jump on board."
4072,and1gator,"July 7, 2011",5,Very Cool! This is an amazing app. Very addictive. It is better than reading the newspaper. It is so interactive. Makes even your twitter feeds look like they were professionally laid out in a magazine. Each article is done like a front page newspaper where you get a little taste and if you want to finish you have to go to the next page. The variety of content and photos blows me away every time I open the app. Just really well done. Kudos to the developers.

Please do the same if you have an iPad. All others will have to wait until the update. Just hope it comes soon.
4074,Fsecco,"December 8, 2011",4,"Great app, lacks mark as read feature The app is great, but it lacks a simple and important feature: ""mark as read"". If I could only mark a page as read or, even better, a post as read without having to enter it, would be great. (the ""mark a page as read after flip"" feature is nice but not that great if you want to flip through posts and dismiss most of them but read a few later)."
4075,Wenditarita,"December 19, 2011",5,"Tremendous Love it. Still learning all it can do but in the past couple of days that I've had it I've really enjoyed 'flipping' through the news, having Twitter articles and my timeline appear together, both accessible and easy to navigate between and generally being able to make the most of my time getting caught up with current events. If you've gotten this far you have to have this app. No reason not to."
4076,i4tographer,"December 30, 2011",5,"Flipboard A must have App!  I have this on both my iPhone & my iPad.  It came highly recommended by a close friend, and I highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't already downloaded it from the App store.  After syncing it with my Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts, it has become the way that I view those feeds.  An interface that responds well with a touch screen and ultra-smooth page transitions make Flipboard truly live up to the hype!"

What I don't get is why flipboard is  now serving up ads.  Not just text ads, but video ads.  Perhaps it is the content provider who snuck these in but either way I expect flipboard to catch and prevent it. One of the perpetrators is digitaltrends and there was another one who I can't remember.  And to those of you who will ask, I tapped on an article.  A video ad cam up.  The only way to get to the article was to fast forward the video to the end.  There is zero doubt that this was an unsolicited ad."

It is integrated very well with Facebook and Twitter, although I hope Google+ is in the works as well. If you read blogs on your devices on the go, Flipboard is an absolute must own!"

It's such an easy and effective way to review a wide range of media (general news, interests, business, and social media feeds).  The style makes super appealing.  The new ""create your own magazine"" (store content of your choosing for later review) is awesome.  I'm in product development / marketing and I plan to share my magazine with others in my company."

I have nothing against soccer, but I can't delete it on my sports, and it shows a ton of soccer news! But then again, I can't hardly find any any apps that gives me up to date news and sports!!

No real integration with proper RSS readers, which was the best part. You could curate your own ""News"" with sources that you wanted to and you dint have to use a terrible magazine interface to do it. Then, two weeks of my videos not working in the app. When they finally started working again, intrusive video ads took up the beginning of the videos. Wasting my time. I don't watch video ads. I'm not going to buy whatever product you're showing me. You're just wasting my time. Done. Deleted. And Crowley recommending that people not use this app. Terrible."

The single best feature I utilize is, the ability to quickly scan Articles and Stories from diversely different topics in seconds. That alone makes this app a winner for me, but I chose to go one step further and 'Curate' content I liked, by flipping into my own magazine. It took some ramping up, but I'm actually getting a following now. Very cool app 5+-"

Zite's interface provided the ability to quickly scan across a variety of topics from intelligently curated content. I had tried to switch to Flipboard on multiple occasions to prepare for the inevitable. I've tried it again for a week and find it doesn't solve my need for a quick scan. Flipboard assumes that I want to consume content one story at a time. It's just too slow. I am retreating to Apple News because the interface is similar enough to Zite. No app had my eyeballs like Zite. I miss it already!

And when the inevitable crash happens, relaunching means having to surf thru all the pages previous to where I was. I thought it would do better on my iPhone 4S but that crashes as well, just not as often, which makes me believe it would be the same on an iPad 2 or 3.

However it is not ipad friendly when it comes to making a new magazine with my original photos and text. I have thousands of photos and digital art on my iPad but this app is incapable of selecting photos from my camera roll or albums. Even if I could create a document in pages and then upload that would be helpful. Also why is there no city guide for San Diego CA?  We are the second largest city in California are we not hipster enough?
4104,Asaganda,"July 22, 2015",4,"Great app!! Love this app on my iPhone, use it daily but one thing that bothers me is that if I go away from the app(hit the home button) and go to another app and then come back to it let's say 5-10mins later, it refreshes the feed and starts me back up at the 1st page instead of where I left off such as in the article that I was reading and/or still flipping through different articles. If a solution can be created for this minute problem, that would be great. Thank you"
4105,Mexicomank,"November 13, 2015",4,Love the new sharing interface but.... I've used Flipboard for about 5 years I love the app I use it everyday don't get me wrong it's the best news reader app but you removed a awesome sharing feature where it automatically added the title of the article and small picture when I sent text messages to friends I wish to get added back because in my opinion it makes it more inconvenient to share news articles with non Flipboard users who are friends
4106,ARothmanMusic,"March 1, 2016",5,"Great Are use this app as a news source on a daily basis and I really think it is great. The major area in which you could use improvement is the comments section. At the moment, you can't stop notifications on an article that you have commented on, nor is it easy to carry on any sort of deeper discussion about an article. It would be great if they implemented Disqus for some other broader solution for handling this feature."

4108,FBAUM,"February 11, 2017",1,Data munching mess - horrible look Flipboard has been my go to for reading the news and other items throughout the day and now they have updated it in the true Apple Style. That is not a good thing. The Apple Style is when you take something functional and try to pretty it up at the expense of functionality. Add on to the fact that now it forces video onto previews and now you have a data munching machine that is cumbersome to use and defeats the whole purpose of why the app existed in the first place. I am so disappointed. I have been using this app for the longest time. Whoever greenlit these design overhauls needs to be given a mop and put in janitorial services.

I wish there was a version for the PC so I could use it instead of the normal website.  It actually makes looking at Facebook and Twitter more exciting and fun.  I also love the way it collects info from different feeds and puts them all in one place and makes them easier to read.  I can't say enough good things about this app."
4112,Tyketto,"December 8, 2011",2,"Nice idea. Too bad all the news sites are leftist BS Nice idea but all the news sources are leftist propaganda. (I mean, really.. one is all about the dirty filthy whiny babies ""occupying"" wall street"".) I think I saw Fox News but when a ""News"" source is KOS and Maddow? Forget it. Deleted the app. If I could tailor the news feeds and not have the ""politics"" tab be filled with crap it would be good. But when I looked how to do that, I read it couldn't be altered and was picked by Flipboard. What I could change was my Twitter news feeds. No thank you. If you're going to promote a bunch of bull**** leftist sites and not let me opt out of seeing garbage I don't want to, then your app is worthless."
4113,MoonDoktor,"December 8, 2011",5,"same goodness, now smaller!! I have been using Flipboard for my go to source for news and social updates for months on my iPad.  Now, it has finally come to my iPhone as well.  I have always been impressed with the clean and concise presentation and once again, Flipboard Inc does NOT disappoint.  Clean lines, well formulated versions of my articles, cut straight from the webpage organized wonderfully into a readable format that is impossible not to enjoy.  Well done."
4114,Meg van,"December 29, 2011",5,"BEST iPad App, Hands Down I had Flipboard for iPhone for a few weeks before getting an iPad and using it on my iPad. I loved it so much on the phone that I thought it couldn't get any better. But on the iPad it's just epic!! Flipboard is THE best app and I recommend it to everyone. I love seeing all my social media in one spot and being able to interact through the app. But I also love all the news/blog following features separated by topic. I discover new things every day!"
4115,Flixstixes,"February 1, 2012",5,Newsworthy I miss not getting my daily paper and it's online version doesn't do it justice. Flipboard has brought my love of reading news back...I was hesitant at first but after not being able to stop reading until I had read all of the pages I then turned to another section until I had   To leave. I got home and watched the national news only to find out that I already knew all of their reports....so long NBC lol
4116,AlvesMark,"March 16, 2012",4,"Great on-the-go viewing on iPhone 4S Fantastic app for catching up with posts, news and pictures when you have a spare moment. You can see the highlights you missed from Twitter, Instagram, curated news sources, search terms and RSS feeds of your choice--and they all look better than the originating stream. There's a photo-only feed, too, that pulls in pics from your selected sources if you want the glossy mag treatment. And if you see a post you like, you can favorite it, RT it or email it right from Flipboard."
4117,metricdisco,"September 27, 2012",5,"Beautiful way to browse content! This gorgeous app is great for flipping through tweets and reading content shared by the people you follow, but the app really shines when it comes to visual feeds. You get a quick visual preview of each item and from there you can easily (and comfortably) read more or share links on your favorite social networks. "
4118,_beowulf,"April 16, 2013",5,"Outstanding! Flipboard has become my most used app on my iPad. It's now my preferred way to stay abreast of what's going on in the world and with my social media connections. The new ""personal magazine"" feature is really cool, but I find it disappointing that my magazines are viewable only by other Flipboard users instead of being made available on the web at large. Hopefully the Flipboard creators can add this feature into a future version."
4119,iphone4+itouch4,"May 31, 2013",4,"Love it - please update RSS support beyond google reader!! PLEASE add support for other RSS reader options before google reader shuts down! It's one of my favorite flipboard tabs, and I wouldn't want a separate tab/board for each feed. :-( I'll transfer to whatever RSS service flipboard adds support for!"
4120,Mdawglive,"April 22, 2011",5,"WOW Honestly, how is this free? This is the kind of app that totally legitimizes the iPad and the entire Apple marketing strategy that encourages third party development. 75% of the now colossal app market are tasteless rehashes of the same uninspired concepts. Flipboard is absolutely perfect for reading RSS feeds (via Google Reader). I would gladly pay for this app and that's coming from a person who has never paid for an app in his life. Big thanks the developers this one. Good to see some creativity in the app dev community."
4121,EmoReaper,"February 1, 2014",5,"THE app to have. Flipboard is all around a wonderful app. You can customize your 'feed' to your liking and it pull up good articles that are very pertinent to your interests. The functionality of the app is very solid. It does not crash and it is easy to use. It is constantly updated so there will always be something new to look at. If you like staying up-to-date with current events, this app is for you."
4122,Potez 540,"September 20, 2014",5,"Annoying crashes and newly annoying page-turn animations With the latest version one of my favorite apps has become subject Annoying crashes (iOS 8) and the newly annoying page-turn animations need to be disabled by some setting. They are too slow, are ugly (I turn off page-turn animations in e-readers too), and are completely screwing up when I try to read the Guardian."
4123,WannabeAShotCalla,"October 7, 2014",5,Finally!! iPhone 6 Plus compatible! I use this app daily and have been checking often for the update that brings compatibility to my iPhone 6 Plus. It was worth the (short) wait. Flipboard is beautiful on this beautiful phone!
4124,TheOne3579,"October 19, 2014",5,"One my favorite apps! I love this app and installed it on my Mac, iPad and iPhone. By getting rid of all the unwanted ads, one cannot ask for more. A couple of things I would like to see, the resolution can be improved on the iPad version. And you should be able to add more social media apps making it one place for all your social media. You should also be able to post on all of your accounts at the same time."
4125,Pantrymoth,"November 3, 2014",2,"Great App This is my primary news source these days, but I'm a little disappointed with all the crashing and flukey page turning I've been experiencing since ios8. It's a great app...please fix."
4126,GscottyB23,"November 22, 2014",5,"Best News Source App Ever Really, what my title says... I look to this app first when finding out about news. It's trustworthy with a mix of obviously satirical and/or lighthearted news you'd want to find. You personalize it to what you want it to tell you about. Whatever you're into, art, entertainment, politics, social affairs, religion, cat videos, sports, books, etc, etc... Whatever you want to find, you just flip around on Flipboard, wherever you are."
4127,Will Eifler,"March 5, 2015",5,"LOVE FlipBoard. It is truly amazing. First of all, reading the news and things I'm interested in, all in one feed, aggregated from many different sources, is the only way to read news and articles. But on top of it the simple brilliance of the interface makes reading a joy. Add to that the ability to publish my own magazines from pinned articles and subscribe to other people's, and there's no wonder I use it every day."
4128,L8-Gr8-Fun-Weasel,"October 27, 2015",5,"But another great way to avoid TV and Fox Knews! Love this app! Interesting, informative, personalized news and info at your fingertips, organized by your own individual interests! You can probably even choose a 24hour, ""fair and balanced"" right-wing propaganda stream if you're missing that from TV. Build your own news updates. "
4129,trying to blend,"March 1, 2016",5,"Everything is right here I was so disappointed when Flipboard replaced Zite. After using it for a couple months though, I have come to love it. Articles on every topic are right at your fingertips. Saved articles are very easy to find due to Flipboard's ability to save to different ""magazines."" It is a highly organized information app that I read articles from several times a day. Give it a try."
4130,Wout,"July 21, 2010",5,"Beautiful but beware The app is simply fantastic. Little touches like the layout, panning front page graphics and instantly being able to switch to web view make it the best news reader I've seen so far."
4131,warrenao,"July 21, 2010",3,"Actually 3.5 stars. This really isn't a bad app. I don't have a FB account, so don't care about connecting to that - but I have experienced the over-capacity issues with Twitter, mentioned by others. It's a little frustrating, yes, but not a deal-breaker, at least not for me."
4132,Tendimensions,"April 19, 2011",5,Awesome app This is really a fantastic app.  At first I just liked the format layout having used the Feedly plugin on Chrome for months.  I was searching for a decent replacement when I got the iPad (because Feedly isn't natively designed for the iPad yet). 
4133,Krauseanator,"August 5, 2011",5,First iPad 2 app This was the first app that I downloaded for my iPad 2. If you use any social network or follow any blogs or even just check news. This is a must have app. It takes all those branches and puts it all into one beautifully designed and easy to use app. Love the single post view and the way you can flip through it. I would gladly pay for this app but what is even better is that it is free.
4134,CAEisele,"December 28, 2011",5,"Great App I hate having to bounce between different apps to see what's going in in my social world and I know that there are so many other apps that could do it, but man this one hit it out of the park!"
4135,EdDoc99,"February 2, 2012",5,"Love it! I have one recommendation-- I love Flipboard! I check it daily along w/my email. It presents everything in a beautiful format & makes reading blogs & feeds easy. My recommendation is that it have more than 2 formatted pages to view only 20 feeds. I have 60 feeds & I'm sure that others have that and more. I hate hitting the search icon & waiting for the others to load. Just put them all up in your polished, professional way, please...."
4136,gmankono,"April 16, 2012",4,"Favorite reader for web articles Flipboard is great for browsing headlines, and is easily my favorite for how it reformats pages into ""flippable"" articles. Much nicer than scrolling through web pages, and seems to fit the phone format extremely well. I'm often bummed when a page can't be reformatted to the page-flip style layout, but even articles that have to be scrolled through are much cleaner than many web sites. "
4137,AnonymousGS,"September 23, 2012",4,Filter or consolidate same topics Great app. Would be nice if news about same topic is consolidated or filtered. For eg last week every page had at least one news on apple iPhone 5 and ios6. There is lots of other stuff/news and one topic overwhelming it and appearing on all pages gets a bit of an overdose. Same thing happened with Facebook stock news. The most trending news needs attn but not every page needs to be filled with it. Any way to make sure good balance of all trending topics?
4138,LorMurf,"August 28, 2013",5,"Freezes I love the App and use it all the time, but since the last update, when I'm in the ""Photo"" section and looking at photos in single photo view, Flipboard will totally freeze on me. It does not happen in multi-photo view or in other sections. I have lots of memory, so that is not the problem. This is my favorite section and I hope it can be resolved. It worked fine before the update. Thanks for any help."
4139,pgvw,"September 19, 2013",4,"Good app. Not perfect. I use this app daily to track my social feeds and different media. It's very useful, easy to use, and stylish."
4140,Local Chicagoan,"August 30, 2013",5,"By far the best news app, ever. I'm not much of a news reader, mostly bc I just don't have the time or patience and know ill hear from someone else later. The ease of this app is phenomenal. It gathers what you enjoy reading, from top news to world to local to other categories.. I enjoy that once I've finished reading the page, it flips upward like a flip chart, it's interesting but makes it somewhat cool & you read more of what you like!"
4141,sxiao12,"December 21, 2013",5,"Love it & Please Fix I absolutely love this app, can't go without it. This is an awesome app for those who likes to keep up with their news or entertainment. I personally use this app to keep up with beauty blogs, celebrities, as well as the daily news. But lately I have not been able to use the app. It would open up and then the screen would freeze. Therefore, i'm not able to tap anything or open up the contents. Please fix!"
4142,Atomitod,"September 1, 2015",2,"Still don't like it. I tried Flipboard when it first came out. It was interesting then because the visual effects (the ""flip"" in Flipboard) were new and different. That quickly wore off and I found the app just wasn't efficient enough to feed me the news and articles I wanted at the speed and ease I needed. That hasn't changed. I simply can't see enough on a single screen to feel like I'm productive with this app. It takes too much time to flip through pages and find what I'm really wanting to read. I'm hoping the Apple news reader in iOS 9 is my solution for Zite being discontinued."
4143,N3ws3,"December 5, 2015",4,Like magazine style reading; Suggestions Prefer the magazine format for a variety sources. 
4144,N2AK,"December 13, 2015",1,"You killed Zite, enough said Zite was one of the very best apps available.  Flipboard is quite simply inferior in functionality and implementation.  ""When you can't compete, you acquire and delete."""
4145,ChadInGR,"December 23, 2015",4,"Not great; good, not great. To start: I hate that Flipboard consumed Zite. ""Thumbs up, a Thumbs down"" worked. The same thing, to improve the stories I see on Flipboard, takes more effort. Call it lazy, but the idea of a news aggregator is ""lazy"" to begin with.  Flipboard's schtick is it's unique UI.  That unique UI gets old quick. ""Cool! It flips!"" becomes ""For crying out loud! I scrolling that hard?!?"" Flipboard has driven Zite users away by not integrating any of Zite's compelling features. I'll be looking for a compelling news reader, probably Apple's own News app."
4146,I like Zite,"January 7, 2016",1,"They are adding fake reviews! From time to time I will come back to the App Store and do a search for Zite. I usually hold my breath for just a moment in hopes that my beloved Zite would appear back in the list of apps for me to install. I keep doing this painful thing to myself because I hope one day someone will have come to their senses and bring my old friend back. I usually will end up here reading all the horible reviews of flipbored and agreeing with all of them and taking solice in the fact that I am not the only one who misses Zite so much it hurts. Well, I get on here today and surprise there is magically a whole bunch of really good fake five star reviews! Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap"
4147,Yo28,"October 31, 2016",5,"Have become a pain I had to switch from 5 to 2 stars as in the previous updates you have not fixed a bug which I don't know if anyone else is experiencing but when I launch the app and start to use it, the a certain part of the app like in the middle becomes not responsive but the bottom and top of the app functions. It's not my phone as other apps work, so is this a bug?"
4148,Chris_Foley,"November 23, 2016",5,Good alternative to news websites Why clutter up your life reading stories you're not interested in? I've found Flipboard to be a great alternative to websites because it has much less distracting advertising and less distracting stories that a quick headline grabs your attention but doesn't have substance.
4149,T Alfaro,"April 14, 2017",5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I love getting updates and insights on my favorite topics without having to endlessly flip through topics I'm NOT interested in. Sure... there are ads, but you just flip through them, too - it's not like you have to watch a video for 5 seconds before you can skip them... and it's a free product that gets me the info I want quickly - I don't have to google anything and scroll through lists - it's a one stop shop!"
4150,Big Joe NYC,"June 19, 2011",4,"Great app This is a great app for twitter.  Previews and a great format make it so much better than endlessly scrolling down a long list of tweets.  It seems to delete repeat tweets which is great.  I would rate higher if it could delete the same tweets from different users. The Facebook previews are great also.  Again, instead of a list of posts, there are previews of pics and other material.  I now see alot more of my friends pics, which is great as I would not go to the trouble of looking at them before."
4151,joshuajdavis,"August 7, 2011",4,"Extremely well put together news app If you're like me and read lots of news on your iPad, than this app is for you. I used to rely on the ""Pulse"" news app as my personalized news hub, but ever since trying out this app I hardly ever use that one anymore. Everything is easy to get to and has a very clean interface that makes reading news (and feeds from Facebook, twitter, etc.) on the iPad an even more enjoyable experience. I highly recommend at least trying it out."
4152,allthingsmotion,"October 17, 2011",5,"Bridging dynamic content with beautiful layouts I cannot believe what this app can do. It presents online information in a traditional print layout. It allows the words, images, and video from family, friends, and the Internet to become and feel like STORIES.... It actually makes we want to approach my social news with a slow read mentality. Every time I open this app, I feel like my dad reading his newspaper  over coffee. Keep Innovating."
4153,PsychoLogicXen,"December 7, 2011",5,"A news app that's actually newsworthy Even being a free app (with tons of 4 and 5 star reviews to boot) I was skeptical to try out Flipboard. Once my reluctance subsided and I gave in to downloading it, I was hooked in 5 minutes."
4154,AJfromTheCruz,"February 29, 2012",5,Innovative concept + solid execution Used to ignore reading my social presence like Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter... because I just didnt have time. But now I dont have to. This integrates them all into a fast & comfortable format. The night view is easy on the eyes. The share function is quick & clean. And I absolutely love the integration with apps like Read It Later because I spend lots of times on planes where Internet is either slow or non-existent. Solid!!!
4155,Harley Bee,"November 10, 2012",5,"Best App I Have Used.. This is the best app that I have ever used so far. I love having Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and my news ALL in one place! I am a HUGE Apple fanatic so my favorite Flipboard is Apple News. It is great, everyone that I've showed this app to also fell in love with it! Including my geometry teacher!! Can't wait to get an iPad and see how great it is on it! I would recommend this app to any social person who enjoys entertaining stories about anything you want."
4156,Pieceofben,"November 26, 2012",5,"Great RSS Feed App! I love reading articles and blogs but I hate going from website to website to read them. This application brings them all together in to  one location so that you can easily read all that you desire, using a fantastic and ingenious layout. I use it probably a thousand times daily for all articles, blogs, and videos that I consume   I've used many other RSS applications but so far this one is still my favorite."
4157,elquer,"November 27, 2012",5,A magical app for a magical device. This app has gone a long way since launched. It has replaced dozens of apps on my phone. The way content is rendered in flip-able cards is natural and ingenious. Further more the infusion of audio and video content into this platform has been carried out perfectly. There is even a promising shopping catalogue in development. I recommend this app to anyone who likes to read and consume content on a daily basis.
4158,Bl@!r,"December 30, 2012",5,One of my favorite apps It took me awhile to download Flipboard but now that I have I can't believe it took me so long to get it.. I was even considering paying for a subscription to a newspaper but now there is no need. I can't believe all the things I have access too and the interface is beautiful and easy to use. Both of my parents just got new iPhones for Christmas and I will be sure to download this app to their phones. Awesome app!
4159,Klyphart,"May 14, 2013",5,"Flip'n Fool, Flipboard has exposed me to information sources that I was not aware of. Sensational daily news is occasionally of interest to me.  Scientific news is apparently an addiction - especially with videos. There's so much of science that is not only fascinating but positive and occasionally frightening.  I lose a lot of sleep flip'n science.  Sourcing Nature/Scientific American and the Association for the Advancement of Science would give Flipboard more depth.  All in all, I'm very happy to have downloaded your app."
4160,Esqsimon,"August 11, 2010",3,Some issues Maybe it's me but what I don't like is that the different feeds aren't viewed as one. You have to go back to the contents and click on each feed when you want to read it. Minor point but if really a magazine let me read everything when I open it. Additionally there appears to be a lag between something being posted on Facebook and appearing here. There shouldn't be. It should update upon opening but seems to take a while before new content shows. Otherwise very interesting app w lots of potential.
4161,SeniorSparky,"April 17, 2011",5,"Amazing! I've only recently had the iPad. I'm so glad I discovered this app so soon. The pages look amazing on the screen. Thanks for taking the time on making an awesome app. And FREE. I look at other and honestly don't compare. It's like a smart and innovative magazine. It sizes pics and articles just right each and every time. I'm glad I can look at the source(like original website) without having to leave the app. Again, this app is AWESOME. DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE."
4162,LynnDMae,"May 14, 2011",5,"Simlpy perfect! A wonderful app!  I am always nervous of the ""free"" in app descriptions, because you generally pay for it one way or another... In app purchases, bombardment of advertising, etc... "
4163,TheLastSchermer,"June 6, 2011",5,"You'll use it every day In my opinion, this is one of the few 'must have' iPad apps available! If you want to keep up with whats happening in your digital life and have it all in one place, and in a sleek and user friendly format that's actually functional, then this app is for you! It makes reading thru your news, twitter, and facebook feeds an actual pleasure rather than a cumbersome pain in the rear."

The best app to have all in one and it makes it easy to find what you like.   I have all my interest in one app, eliminating the need to go searching for stuff.  I have also used it for situational awareness in my job to monitor important news that can impact my services. Definitely a must to have,"

You can change topics, change genres, change collections. It's great. I spend most of my social media time of Flipboard. Thank God it doesn't focus on politics and all the crazy media we're flooded with. Lots of data, on just about every subject and things the news SHOULD be reporting on but doesn't. Thanks Flipboard. A great way to read."

Other apps that use that similar to this one but not as good , use stuff I used to streamline. So going to google and going to their reader under other stuff and fill it.  All apps work great now.  Plus it comes with extra things to read. Thanks!  Great app once again love it."
4174,nutragirl,"July 29, 2012",4,"Why can't we have more than three main pages? Flipboard is really wonderful, but I find it aggravating that there are only three main pages and then a box with ""more."". You have to click on that and then select content, but you don't get to see the main page displayed as you do when you flip through the front section. Why is this?  It seems utterly ridiculous. Please fix this. The whole point is to make a ""magazine,"" right?"
4175,miromoro151,"November 22, 2012",5,"Awesome! This is the first review i ever write since using ive used iphones since 2008. I got this app for my iphone 5 n i cant put it down! News has never looked so good, its eye candy for the news addicts n non addicts alike. Perfect to keep you up to date on everything while drinking your coffee and also the built in radio player. Thank you for creating such an app which makes the iphone experience a lil more awesome than it already is!"

I see all the articles that interest me and see that they're all from different papers or news teams. Flipbook thank you for being awesome!!!!
4177,lawyerly12488,"November 5, 2013",5,"The One Since downloading flipboard, I have discarded each and every one of my other news related apps. Flipboard features news from the best sources, it offers a wide variety of content on multiple subjects, and allows for the perfect balance between widespread usability and individual customization. All of these culminate in an outstanding (and straightforward) user experience. Try it. You won't be disappointed."
4178,Waldeaux,"September 19, 2014",4,"Love the app, crashes on iOS 8 I've been using Flipboard for a number of years and it gets better and better. I use it almost exclusively for consuming and posting social media and news. I prefer the iPhone version as I really like the swipe gestures. "

It is still sometimes difficult to locate exactly what I want. The system isn't quite intuitive enough to figure out my interests based on previous sessions, but it continues to improve. It's still ahead of most competitors and the layout and functionality are very good."
4180,Larry Kollar,"August 14, 2010",4,"It's almost magical Checking all the links in your Twitter stream can be tedious, especially if you follow people who post a lot of links. Flipboard not only makes it fun, it helps you not miss something important. The concept of building a magazine from someone's tweetstream is great — and making it work as well as it does is nearly magical."
4181,adauria,"February 4, 2011",5,"Truly awesome This app has spoiled me for any other way of viewing Twitter. You get so much more content, pics, etc. The interface is very intuitive. Even though it pulls down more data than a normal Twitter feed by pulling stuff from links, etc., it seems you can actually skim more of it faster and see what you want to dive into and what you don't at a glance."

Puts all the stuff I want to read in one convenient place (and in magazine format no less! It makes Facebook actually fun to use.). 
4183,browneagle44,"April 17, 2011",5,"Best reader app you can find Make no mistake, this app is a reader app, gathering feeds and translating them into beautiful magazine-style pages for you to flip through.  "
4184,Bigredz75,"April 28, 2011",5,"Not a real big reader I'm really not a big fan of reading, but since i got my ipad and found this app. i read almost every night in bed. And having your favorite magazines , Face book, News and more at just a simple touch. Sure you can exit out and go to a new app, but this keeps them in all in one nice orderly form. Gives hope to future readers as well as myself, to have a different way to read more.... thanks"
4185,Chrysophylax,"November 18, 2011",3,"Needs Multiuser Support This app provides a fresh new take on social networking and newsreading. Now allows multiple accounts, but they forgot to include a quick and easy (elegant) solution to switching between user accounts. You have to completely sign out before it allows another user to log in, instead of giving fast user switching options. At least I can use it now too, instead of surrendering it to my wife, but we find the logging in process too tedious."
4186,EnggaG,"December 7, 2011",4,"flipboard for iphone 4 Just downloaded this and i've been a fan since ipad version came out. Almost as cool as the older brother, just missing some navigation control from article to article. So when ur reading an article, u have to go back to the main section then click the next news to read. It should be like on ipad, reading between article to article within a section is just a flip away, not two flips. All in all, glad this is on iphone now :)"
4187,Swiat34,"December 8, 2011",4,Great reviews and functionality Follow up:
4188,silversword411,"December 14, 2011",3,"Buggy google reader support since last pass account registration Ever since they added the ""option"" of being able to register a Flipboard account for syncing read options across multiple devices there are continuous problems with it not refreshing the current google reader unread count, and marking articles as read in google reader. Tried registering a Flipboard account in the hopes it'd fix the problem to no effect. Please fix!"
4189,Paradym3,"May 16, 2017",5,***Fixed*** The audio playback pause should be fixed ***This was fixed by the developer as promised***
4190,ndrwstn,"December 9, 2011",2,"Changes are more for the company then the consumer If you're not paying for something, you're not the customer; You're the product being sold."
4191,Chefjanae,"January 28, 2012",5,"Love Flipboard!!! I came across this app from the Apple website. I just purchased my IPad2 and was looking for apps that we're useful to me. Once I read a few reviews and saw it was free, I was sold. But once I started using the app it became a daily obsession! It's now on my IPhone as well and my husband recently started using it just because I talked about it so much. The ease of use, the design and style of the articles, its amazing! "
4192,Keron Lewis,"February 6, 2012",5,Pretty awesome I'm not gonna lie when I first opened it I thought it would be just another stupid app but it makes everything so much more interesting. The Facebook portion I actually use a lot more then the actual Facebook app as it makes my friends seem a lot more interesting with the positioning. I am able to keep up with local news and media. It is an amazing app and I recommended as a must have for new iPad users
4193,jesse1623,"March 12, 2012",5,"Amazing App, some hopes for it... Finding a way to have the images on certain sights upload in high quality. Also, have option to load full pages into flipboard format and not have to visit original link all the time, also have a built in offline storage option, videos don't play landscaped inside flipboard, also state it sites have flipboard preferred view or not, so I know which ones to add"
4194,Gino LV,"November 26, 2012",5,My favorite app of all... Flipboard is by far the best way to read news and discover new content. It's more than just a news aggregator or RSS reader. It does all that and more in style.
4195,Jpsnow85,"November 27, 2012",5,"Awesome app! This app is a fun, tactile, engaging way to skim information of particular interest to you. I like to review politics, news, educational developments (I'm a teacher) and many others. This would be a great tool to get kids interested on reading/current events. Pair this app with the 'pocket' app, which allows you to save articles to read for later and you'll always have something interesting to read. Highly recommend!"
4196,aaronmeyer,"October 7, 2014",5,Must-Have App There isn't another app that I open EVERY time I grab my iPhone or my iPad. This is simply a fantastic tool and one that I would recommend to anyone who doesn't have time to browse the web for their news/rss feeds.
4197,Jnstange,"January 16, 2016",1,Bad app. Here's why... Flipping constantly makes for a very annoying user experience. Don't bother with this app. You'll get sick of it almost instantly.
4198,Iamnotanmbr,"June 16, 2016",2,Zite was better Used Zite for many years. Was a great app. It managed to keep new stuff coming in but still would focus on things I wanted to read. 
4199,Hi 641,"March 14, 2017",1,Why is this app getting progressively worse Now it is completely non-functioning because of a forced slide-up.  The updates have continued to make this app a waste to time. Let's rehash...
4200,darianr,"July 21, 2010",4,"Intuitive and simple This is a really cool app. It's perfectly suited for the iPad, and makes reading content from sources like Facebook and Twitter more digestible. At the present, it's extremely popular and showing some growing pains. This is something which will be quickly remedied, no doubt, and people giving it one star because it won't connect to Twitter or Facebook without mentioning all of the other content are doing themselves and the review readers a huge disservice. Please, give it a chance!"
4201,realdarthmole,"July 23, 2010",5,"It´s a revolution! After finding out about this product I downloaded it immediately - and it worked right from the start. So please stop whining and give them a few days to adjust to the traffic. After all, we have a zero to number one hit app here - and let me tell you: It´s awesome! If have to agreed to Robert Scoble´s view and I thing this app will certainly change (and enhance) the way you use your iPad! I love it!"
4202,Jahman7,"July 27, 2010",4,"Awesome idea Because print media is so beautiful on the iPad, this is a great idea bringing social media to a print format. It works great and I can't wait to see the release when it is in full bloom."
4203,YRG999,"April 22, 2011",5,"Addicting I don't know how I kept up with all my different sources for news and information before. Flipboard consolidates Twitter feeds, Google Reader, Facebook statuses, news, and searches all in an easy to digest magazine format. This is only my second day using it, but I feel it'll be my go to standard for years! Great app and I look forward to more from this company in the future. This is the future of print. It puts The Daily to shame!"
4204,DerickL,"June 14, 2011",5,"Great for news, needs Tumblr support!!! One of my favorite apps!! It is great for reading the news or blogs. I also like viewing the pictures on National Geographic or Flickr. It is not good for twitter or Facebook though, since it just displays a few tweets or status updates (about 8). But with the other pages, such as news, it works great. One thing that would make it my favorite app is if you could view your Tumblr Dashboard!! Pleassseee add that!"
4205,Vitor Mendonca,"June 30, 2011",5,Best iPad app By far the best iPad app. No other app has beaten it yet. No need for any other news app - this is the one.
4206,magandustyn,"July 6, 2011",5,Easy and fun to use I love using Flipbook for my Google Reader. It looks freaking awesome and it never has problems or crashes on me. It easily brings in all my folders so I can read things organizationally and don't have to pilfer through tons of things I don't want to read yet. It's clean and smooth. Works well. Try it! You'll wait to read your google reader on your iPad instead of your computer because it's that snazzy.
4207,carrera.owner,"August 24, 2011",5,"Clever Implementation of news gathering app Just got the iPad and after reading about this app in Time a couple of weeks ago, I kinda knew what to expect. However the article in Time did not adequately convey just how clever the layout is and how intuitive is it. This iPad is for my Mom (aka, senior citizen with very little computer skills) and she was flipping through the pages with ease.  "
4208,1samu,"September 8, 2011",5,"I don't write reviews unless the app is really good or really bad.. and I have to say this one is great. Definitely one-of if not my most used app. It's easy, intuitive and fun to brows all the blogs, publications and social networks you watch or are apart of. With easy share, email and view-in-safari features it's a convenient alternative to any program on my Mac, iPhone or otherwise. If every app was as good as this there'd be no point in writing reviews."
4209,ModifiedTubeSock,"April 14, 2017",5,Favorite News App This is one of a handful of apps that I use everyday.  It is my go to app for news/interests.  It allows you to compile magazines that contain the articles that interest you in an area of activity of endeavor.   You can follow other people's magazines as well as magazines from well-known news sources.  This is the future of news reading today.  Highly recommended (I never use Apple News for example)
4210,LeventD,"September 22, 2012",4,"Oh my... One of the biggest complain on the iphone version of app from my side was lack of ability to show multiple articles on one page, like the ipad version. Now it says that you can do it but only on iPhone 5, because of longer screen aspect. Looks like only 0,5 inches and a couple of pixels are seperating us from that functionality and I can't accept it. If you think you could do it for pre-5 devices, please do it. Please is the word, please is the saviour..."
4211,ObiBinks,"December 29, 2012",5,"My Favorite App This is definitely my favorite app.  I can view all the news stories from twitter, Facebook, and almost any other site.  I can retweet stories with one touch, post to my personal Facebook page and the page I manage with ease.  I can flip through news to find interesting articles quickly.  The app is fun to use and I utilize it to keep up-to-date on what's happening in the world."
4212,SupaDupaScrambler,"June 14, 2013",4,"Favorite way to consume news, blogs, etc... Have been using Flipboard for over a year, it is one of the apps I use most because I can get everything in one place. News, blogs, Everything. If certain sites don't read so easily and you are finding that you have to pinch and zoom too much, try to subscribe to their Facebook page if they have one. I find this loads the content in a way that's more readable. Being able to save to Instapaper is the best!"
4213,yelvis,"July 1, 2013",5,"Great app but current version does refresh correctly I love this app and use it every day. Unfortunately, my iPad version does not auto refresh anymore (eg when I click on the app the same news shows even if it is a day old). The flip to refresh feature doesn't work either. I have to shut the app off by killing it in the background and then it will refresh once. Please fix!"
4214,Jhein926,"May 23, 2014",5,"Most used app! Love this app!!- this is exactly what I've been looking for to keep up on the latest of everything. Incredibly customizable, easy to use, beautiful transitions and fun. This is the first and last app I use each day. Keeps all the news and my interests consolidated in one spot. Can spend hours getting into links and can navigate back to where I started in two clicks. Thank you for this!"
4215,Ryshkin,"June 17, 2014",5,"Enjoyed from the beginning... I honestly didn't do much ""comparison"" shopping for this app. I took it at face value based on description, options, and other peoples reviews. I have not been disappointed and haven't looked back since downloading. Everything I need in a news/""going's on"" app including integrate Facebook support for instant sharing of articles. You will only know if you try it."
4216,Dentite,"May 10, 2015",3,"Good support response.  TONs of data usage *Thanks for letting us block feeds again! It's a big help.*  A lot of the formatting is off: Some sources come in as a flip style others a scroll.  Inconsistent design and interface ruins the experience. Also , this app uses more cell data than any other app on my phone...more then safari does.  Can you make this more mobile friendly with Image sizes and whatever else is eating up my data? This is the first month I've ever gone over on data, and 1gb was from flipboard."
4217,KTallguy,"August 21, 2015",4,"Works with a little wrangling! I enjoy Flipboard's interface and it's fun to navigate. Personally I like to name the exact sources I want to read and not get pushed content, so I went in and customized everything. It took a while for my feed to update but now it only shows things I want to see. What I'd really like are the following features: "
4218,McLeodSF,"December 21, 2015",5,"Great place to keep up on things Flipboard's intuitive interface takes makes reading the news digitally a much more tactile, enjoyable experience. The ability to get news from multiple sources and seamlessly present them provides a strong platform to become well-informed. Sharing articles with friends or your spouse makes it a nice tool to share interesting information."
4219,BassoonGuy68,"March 1, 2016",5,"Great! Flipboard is the first thing I open on my iPad to check the local and national news.  It allows feeds from all the news outlets in my city along with our newspaper.  I love the automotive sites like Car and Driver, MotorTrend, and the AutoBlog.  I also love the science and technology sites.  The app never fails, has that cool page-flipping look, and offers so much FREE stuff to read.  If there are better readers, I don't know what they are.  Flipboard is #1 to me!"
4220,caljglenn,"June 22, 2011",5,"What a great concept! Finally I have a reason to care about Twitter. I recently got a new iPad. I downloaded this app because it had support for Flickr, but I got a whole bunch more. I love how the app takes your feeds and creates a personalized book for you. I love flipping through the wonderfully crafted pages and seeing all the Twitter and Facebook posts come to life. It's so much more appealing than looking through and endless list of tweet, hashes, retweets, etc."
4221,Germ994,"July 7, 2011",5,"Not your typical sausage fest. I bought it thinking it would be just another ridiculous app that I wasted another darn dollar on.  After a few minutes I realized it was in fact exactly that, another darn app that I wasted another darn dollar on.  The news sites are just mirroring their stations twitter feeds and the featured interfaces are a little too hipster for my taste.  I will say that it isn't the sausage fest most of the other apps are, so 5 stars to that!"
4222,KHC97,"August 5, 2011",4,Great personalized magazine Makes it so much easier to read RSS feeds and feeds with links as those linked pages appear immediately. I love the clean and simple aspects of the design and the ability to get several news sources at once. It's very intuitive.
4223,LOnline,"August 20, 2011",5,"One of the best, most pleasant of the apps Easy to learn to use. So mindlessly easy, I immediately began enjoying Flipboard from the first turn of the page.  Beautifully laid out, variety, with the information I want and none that I don't want. "
4224,Yensid629,"December 9, 2011",5,"Would have been five stars except for one little thing... I truly love this app.  The UI is beautiful, and the way the stories are presented is beautiful.  My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the only way to save favorites is through a twitter account.  I don't have a twitter account, I don't need one, nor to I feel like being forced into one.  I'm all about choice, and being limited or influenced into a choice is not for me."
4225,Lindylou583,"December 22, 2011",3,Copyright protection vs copy/paste Flipboard is perverting the the basic computer function of copy/cut/paste. I updated to version 1.7.1 last week and have thought for a few days that my ipad wasn't functioning right but it is becoming clear that it is this application. 
4226,An123on345,"January 2, 2012",5,"Perfect Beautiful layout.  Love flipping between stories and pages.  Facebook and Twitter integration makes it easy to see everything that's going on in one place.  You can set up the homenpage however you want - I have news, tech, twitter, and fb there.  Tap a section to flip through the stories.  Pics are rendered beautifully.  I start every morning with this news app - I tried several and it is by far the best."
4227,KDReeves,"February 8, 2012",5,"Simply Flawless This is one of the most beautifully executed apps I've ever seen, and not just within the aggregator milieu. The interface is gorgeous, the execution sophisticated, and the ability to adapt to various sizes, content sources, and formats is remarkable. I cannot say anything negative about this app, and recommend it heartily to everyone who uses social media networking as a significant means of keeping in touch with the world as well as friends and loved ones."
4228,2+1mom,"March 14, 2012",4,"Pretty awesome, would like more functionality for google reader This app is a great timesaver. Easily access many sites, customizeable to your interests. I use it to access my Google reader account the most. The pages load quickly, easy to refresh. You can star posts too. My one complaint is that you can't tag the posts the way you can in Reader itself or on the iphone google app. That would make it perfect. Would be great to see in future updates."
4229,fsuscotsman1,"April 15, 2012",3,"Good app, marred by liberal slant Don't get me wrong, I love Flipboard. Getting all of my Facebook, Twitter and everything else in one place is great. Just don't expect to get a fair analysis of the news or politics. Everything has a far left slant, and I do mean everything. Open up Politics and you get bombarded by The Daily Kos, The Huffington Post, Reason and NPR. I thought I was sitting at a DNC political brief!! It wasn't much better with the News of the day, with MSNBC being given the ranking spot."
4230,pendolino,"July 22, 2010",4,A five star app with issues but excellent! I've played with this app briefly but what i have seen so far is extremely impressive:
4231,eselqueso,"July 22, 2010",2,"Interesting idea, painful execution If you don't have the infrastructure to support your users, don't release the app and alienate your user base before they even start. People are obviously interested in the concept, but pushing it out the door before anyone can use it properly is frustrating and a waste of everyone's time."
4232,Tributary2007,"August 29, 2010",5,"true killer app -- a game changer in social media Disregard the negative reviews about ""wait lists"" and capacity problems.  Those have been cleared up.  This is an amazing app, it converts your Twitter feeds and facebook wall into a magazine format that looks and feels a lot like Time magazine."
4233,briany,"March 13, 2011",5,"You must have this! I had heard about this app before and friends raving about it.  Little did I realize that everything you hear is true and will change the way you interact with your RSS feeds, Facebook and Twitter!  It's simply amazing to see your feeds presented this way and makes access to the full articles, photos, videos completely seamless and natural.  It's free so you have no excuse to download it and give it a try!"
4234,Fluffy Vampire,"March 22, 2016",4,"Capable Hey, it does a fine job aggregating content, and the engine is pretty smart at delivering article I find useful. "
4235,Ron in Seattle,"June 17, 2016",4,"Loved it three years ago. Less so now I loved it when I first started using it a few years ago. But the look, feel and usability have all diminished over the years. "
4236,Tania H.,"October 4, 2016",2,Starting to be my least favorite news app This used to be by far my favorite go to app for news aggregation. Not anymore!
4237,Great unmasks geisha,"February 9, 2017",1,"Terrible update I have been using Flipboard for many years now, and my previous rating was 5 stars. I use it nearly everyday and often many times throughout the the day. "
4238,KrystopherBoyle,"February 16, 2017",3,"The onboarding UX is user-hostile Flip board was once the very model of a simple and intuitive user experience. This has been shed in favor of a whirlwind of ever-present onboarding screens that redeploy whenever the app gets booted cold. Once you get past the blitz, you wade into a UI that is not terrible - it's just congested with settings and features that I don't care about. The core UICollectionView navigation matrix is well implemented as always; I just wish that it was the star of the show. Why so many layers of abstraction separating me from the content I want to see?"
4239,jklmkohl,"March 25, 2017",5,"Crashing!!! This is the third time this has happened where the site crashes on my iPad and I have to reenter the magazines/topics I want to read.

4240,jimmy.k.,"April 3, 2013",3,Flipboard for Photos; Pulse for Everything Else Flipboard definitely looks great. But it is not really effective as everyday reader.  The biggest problem is that it doesn't track which articles have being read. But it 
4241,nyp797,"June 14, 2013",5,"Compelling For someone in the news business, I'm embarrassed that I haven't made use of this app already. It is very compelling, well constructed and very timely. I like how you can go back in time so to speak by flipping backwards on any linked or flipped story."
4242,Megarama1,"July 9, 2014",5,B y far best news app yet The best. Top stories and politics combines stories from my favorited news sources. Icons offer immediate portal to favorite news sources. Magazines let me compile favorites and ones to come back to on different topics. Loaded my Facebook feed which is a cool future but I check Facebook so much that I then hid it to not over Facebook myself. I love this. It has changed my whole news experience. Thank you flipboard!
4243,iczrx,"July 17, 2014",5,"One of the best Great app that allows you to keep more than up to date on just about any topic/city/thingyoucanthinkof . The built in flip board magazines are great but after a while it's good to start adding your own sources if u want more relevant local or niche content. Beware, a lot of time can be spent flipping through the virtual pages and reading so I like to use this in combination with the yahoo news digest app. Digest is great but flip board is epic"
4244,TreverJP,"November 11, 2014",4,"Awesome update, but constant refresh looses reading place This update is awesome!! It's has made things so much more fluid and intuitive. I have tried many other competitive apps and none of the come close. My one and only complaint is the constant refresh the app does. I'll be in the middle of an article, leave the app and return at a later time and the app had refreshed taking me back to my home screen. This is something that I hope is fixed soon."
4245,Fanfoot.,"November 16, 2015",4,"Latest version has completely broken sharing Hope they fix this fast because this is really annoying. Unless you want to email an article pretty much everything else doesn't work. Open in Safari, share on Twitter or Facebook or text. All hidden behind ""Open in other apps"" and most of the time when you click on this you just get an empty menu. Geez. Time to try out Apple news again..."
4246,Foxybanjo,"November 28, 2015",1,"Not half as good as site I hate this.  Site was sooooo much better.  For example, in Zite I could specify a category like Gadgets.  Then in that would be a list of articles about gadgets.   In Flipboard, you specify gadgets and its a list of generic gadget of the day list, and when you click on them its just a list of gadget articles which don't describe well enough what it is.  So basically a generic list within a list all mean to force you to click several times to get to what you want.  Pathetic.  Oh and flipboard as your flipping thru has this whole page adds you have to get thru.  Sooooo worse then Zite.  So sad to see they bought Zite and its going away."
4247,Terrano,"December 5, 2015",5,"Destroying the Zite Experience Great example of how to destroy user experience, I was an early adopter for both Zite and Flipboard, and always preferred the clean and intuitive design of Zite. This week I was forced to migrate my content to Flipboard and everything crashed - I'm looking forward to find the next Zite. I was using the app constantly during the entire day, I just uninstalled Flipboard doesn't add anything to my research for critical content."
4248,CusTunes,"December 19, 2015",4,"What year is this? I liked this app until it got stale 3-4 years ago. Then I discovered Zite, which was actually an intuitive way to get news from feeds I didn't have to find and add myself. By the time I've done that, why would I want to use this crappy app to read them? "
4249,Beekums,"March 22, 2016",4,"Still the best of its kind I've stuck with Flipboard for years it seems because it is easy to use. Not only can you get feeds from big media, but you can choose from lots of creations by folks focused on smaller topics, such as compilations of Wordpress related articles, basketball, celebrities, what ever floats your boat."
4250,kentuckymama,"March 21, 2011",5,"This is the best iPad app I have. And it is free. Flipboard is, quite simply, amazing. All the quirks that come along with trying to read articles on your iPad -- gone. It turns your Facebook feed, Twitter stream, RSS feed and lots of other sites you love into a gorgeous, smooth, and fulfilling user experience. This is my number one MUST HAVE app for any iPad user. I liked my iPad a lot before. Now I love it. It has changed my relationship with the hardware, and in a good, good way."
4251,SuePolinsky,"June 2, 2011",5,"Flipboard fast and good Great app, was turned onto it by Robert Scoble. Am ""old net folk"" used to having a separate app for each protocol and google reader didn't make it easy enough for multiple mobile devices. Flipboard solves my iPad needs (I'm a late adopter) and makes me read my blogs faster and found I'm reading more again. Wish there was more US news in the feeds but it handles everything very well and is unbelievably free. I'd pay for it. Kudos."
4252,M. Kienan Briscoe,"June 26, 2011",5,"Read this more than the Times. I got the NY Times App, and find myself reading Flipboard each morning instead. It takes all your social networking sites and interests and compresses them into a single comprehensive magazine. I have my Tweets, my Facebook updates, Sports, NY news, ZAGAT restaurants, Video Game news, and more all in one magazine that updates as it receives information. You never have to read another paper again."
4253,Edyne Paul,"August 28, 2011",5,No words... My hat goes off to the developers. This is the way content SHOULD be viewed on the iPad... It's beautiful and natural. Apple should (and I'm sure they are since they're smart people) look to you guys for the way that content is presented to the user. This app alone has made it difficult for me to put down my iPad (which is a problem in law school).  I don't want to view my content any other way. : )
4254,WhyDoIHaveToCreateANickname?,"December 7, 2011",5,"Now also a must have app for the iPhone Calm down, kids. A 2-second search online showed that Flipboard's online service was down for part of today. It's back up now so you shouldn't get the ""no Internet connection"" error. "

4256,S333W,"February 1, 2012",5,"Amazing app I agree with all of the glowing reviews. I also agree that it needs a favorite button or at least an easy way to send articles to email to save for later, or, with recipes, to look up again. I love checking out the articles every day. It is keeping me up to date on current affairs and gives me tons of conversation topics to discuss with others. Really superb job on this one!"
4257,CDENZEL,"May 30, 2012",5,Everything in one! (including music!!!) This is a great app for getting everything you want from all your other social/news related apps you have. The only reason the average rating isn't 5 stars is because of those exceptional cases. Not only can you just read articles and news feeds etc... You can play SoundCloud straight through the app. It blows me away how wide a spectrum this app covers.
4258,YesNoCancel,"August 3, 2012",4,"Getting better for Google Reader Hey thanks for adding Readability! And the ability to remove the Google Reader pane, without deleting individual feeds. And the ability to mark all articles in a feed as read."
4259,jasonrkillian,"March 23, 2013",3,"Mark As Read / Sources for Cover Stories Now that Google Reader is going away, is there a way to mark items in other feeds as read? I'd like to have other non-Google RSS feeds marked and updated so I don't have to flip through everything I've already read every time."
4260,glennedy,"August 12, 2010",5,Updated Review: Amazing!!! Having received my invite and spending some time with it I think the biggest compliment I can give is to say that Flipboard has single-app-edly changed the way I am consuming and sharing  information AND increased my volume at least 5 fold every morning. I can only image (and hope it will come) when I can add more categories and media outlets. Huge kudos to the Flipboard team. Keep up the incredible work. 
4261,sorry_ryan_sux,"September 29, 2010",5,"One of the reasons to own an iPad Flipboard is one of the premiere reasons for owning an iPad. I use this app every day to find out what's going on with my friends and in the news. It really is incredibly innovative. My one complaint would be that the application will sync with your Facebook account to stream your friend's posts but it won't let you posts articles from flipboard to your Facebook (only Twitter). Beyond that, I love the application."
4262,Jackncoke7,"September 16, 2014",5,"Know things now This reader is great. I use it constantly. It's basically open all the time because I ""flip"" through it anytime I have a moment to. Flipboard keeps me up to date on all the topics I'm interested in. It also makes suggestion based on my choices. If I find an article that requires deep reading, I'll save it to Pocket, and come back to it later. I can't say enough great things about it."
4263,Lothariorowe,"November 18, 2014",2,"Wonderful - With Flaws The previous version seemed to keep stories in chronological order, and the cover image of each magazine corresponded with the first story in the magazine. Now stories seem to be recycled - stories I read yesterday wind up as the first story a day or two later - and more annoying than anything - the cover image of magazines no longer corresponds to the first story in the magazine. It now corresponds to some random story that you might have to flip through 10 others just to get to. Not smart when you open the magazine specifically for that cover story."
4264,NotAlexNoyle,"July 24, 2015",4,"Excellent News App! I've been a flipboard user for several years, and I absolutely love it. The social aspect is really what puts it over the edge. One of my Reddit friends and I host an Apple news feed and the feedback we get is real really brilliant. It's so great to be able to build a community around news. The app also has an excellent UI, and a great apple watch extension. My only complaint is that there should be a paid option to remove ads, perhaps as an in-app purchase."
4265,-VV,"February 12, 2016",5,Great stuff! Got me checking in and reading such a variety every day. They update and change frequently during the day but on top of what came before so that I can catch up during the day to older stuff if I don't get to it.  Just love this news option.
4266,TamaraJune,"September 18, 2016",5,Excellent tool for PD I enjoy being able to read/skim the short synopsis of articles. This allows me to read complete articles that are of interest. I like bookmarking articles that I find on the web to be able to reference at a later time. 
4267,iPhotoGuy,"October 16, 2016",3,"Better on iPad I have been using Flipboard for years now. However lately with the iPhone version of the app, the amount of spam through web links has gotten out of control. Also with my favorite boards, sometimes I click on the board and it will not open up. I try to reboot it, nothing. This only happens on the iPhone version. On my iPad I don't experience these issues so I will only be using the iPad version until this is fixed. I didn't want to do it but I deleted it off my phone."
4268,Bird_medic,"February 9, 2017",4,My most utilized app! Love Flipboard.  Great customization and continual updates to improve it.
4269,Mothyberry,"February 27, 2017",1,"Something Changed In one of the most recent updates to flip board, they changed the look and also must have changed the algorithm that shows you new stories. This went from my favorite educational time-consumer, to an irrelevant terrible pile of stories that is almost completely uninteresting 80% of the time. Even after the filtering and feedback it's just terrible now. So sad I updated. They improved it for a couple months but after the latest 2017 update, no longer a useful app. Why change the app design every few months. Went from an app I always recommend to friends to a clunky headache."
4270,Rob22909,"March 27, 2012",5,"Robert I never never bother to write reviews but just had to with this application. This is by far the best application I've seen on both the iPhone or the iPad. The integration with all the social media sites is completely seamless. The transition from a posting of the source media to the underlying webpage, again is perfectly seamless. The layout of the flipboard pages are perfectly clean."
4271,allrebr,"March 29, 2012",5,I love this app!!! I am so happy that you can have it on iphone also now! Not just iPad. This is a perfect app for those people who like to stay up to date on what is going on in all aspects of the world. And because you can customize it to just what you like or want to know more about it is perfect. This way I don't have to go through all the stuff I don't care about and read just the things that I like.
4272,Steppdaddy,"May 2, 2012",5,"This app is a game changer!!! First review on the iTunes store. The reason I have to leave one now is that this flipboard app is really pretty revalutionary in terms of apps IMO because it has changed the way I have used the iPad entirely. I rarely use safari for news now, almost never use Facebook, and I've found lots of great new sites that flipboard automatically pulls info from. Simple and beautiful- first must have I have found."
4273,MrGutts,"June 13, 2012",1,"Candy coated I see a Ton of people are blinded by the candy coating of the app. What people are failing to see is that news items for everything in the back end are not updating fast enough. Let take CNN for example, right now I see only two stories from yesterday listed and not one thing new today. Your kidding right? Tons of other news sources have the same problem.  On top of that you can't even customize your own page, you are forced to see what flipboard employees think are good. Like news sources from AOL."
4274,Cede822,"July 31, 2012",5,AWESOME I love this app I use it so much on an everyday use. Even sent up rss feeds from google+ and I set up pocket for read later. Also I think the Facebook in flipboard is awesome. better then the Facebook app it self. Facebook is slow compare to flipboard just amazing app. Wish you can have different ways to arrange how this are displayed and if you want white background or black... But other wise it's a 10 in must have apps.
4275,Cisco6733,"December 24, 2012",4,"Update please Guys, your interface and concept are what make this app so popular but would make this app so much better is if you guys had up to date feeds - like Facebook or news sources are always a little ahead of the actual site Flipboard is showing. I'm sure you guys have heard this before so please make an update that fixes this bc ideally i would like to wake up in the morning and do my news checking from just one place and that's flipboard."
4276,Nn1324659876,"April 7, 2013",3,"Meh I downloaded Flipboard because I was looking for a possible replacement for my RSS app since it pulls info directly from Google Reader. Flipboard looks nice, but the constant flicking of my thumb to view one article at a time is highly annoying. I go through about 150 articles a day from various sources and could really use a more utilitarian interface in which to browse my articles. "
4277,eaton11,"June 15, 2013",5,"Keeps me in the know Makes reading recent happenings fun and organized. I like how I can attach my Pocket app and save articles to read later in Pocket, but I wish I didn't have to open up a menu in the article to do it. Actually, now that I think about it, you have to open up a menu to do pretty much anything with an article. I wish there were some hot keys. That aside, I use it daily because its great."
4278,Mnyshot,"August 30, 2013",5,Nice app for iPhone I've always liked the app for the iPad because of the iPad size but was hesitant to try on the iPhone.  After trying it for a few days using the iphone it really is a nice format.

4280,Rod 10,"July 21, 2010",4,"Great app a little buggy at the beginning but afterwards it It is awesome what this app does to your Twitter & FB accounts, the way it presents the information is unrivaled. However, I did experienced a few glitches (and frustration) when trying to set up my accounts the first time; but once it worked I was really amazed with the outcome. I will only have to questions:"
4281,Captain Latte,"July 23, 2010",1,"Very Unprofessional This product is getting so much hype yet it should never have been released in the shape it's in. To call it a beta is really stretching things as it more closely resembles an in-house alpha. Certainly this app has a lot of potential but geez guys maybe a little testing, especially load testing with all the seed money you have would have been nice instead of wasting everyone's time."
4282,cndboy,"August 22, 2010",5,"Absolutely fabulous & beautiful I just downloaded this app within the last hour, with great hesitation after some of the poor reviews, but since it was in the Apple commercial I decided to proceed.  Thank goodness I did because this app is really, really, really wonderful and so beautifully presented.  It's a true pleasure to use, read and play with!"
4283,danceattakjohn,"September 29, 2010",5,"Finally i understand For a couple years I've felt behind with Internet 2.0, especially because I didn't understand how to use Twitter or rss feeds or anything. This app did more for me in five minutes as far as expanding my comprehension of feeds and the capability of today's Internet than i could have gained from reading 10 text books or fumbling around on twitter for a year.  Absolutely amazing app. I'm blown away."
4284,Ws-architect,"October 27, 2010",5,IPad/Flipboard This is an incredibly fortuitous combination of media and technology combining to provide powerful educational  tool. 
4285,Kaiserslautern,"July 22, 2011",5,"Great app Preset pages are an excellent feature. Great to have all my main news sites aggregated through one app. GUI is fantastic. Please continue to expand access to new subscriptions. Would be nice to have access to the premium access through one aggregate login/fee. NYT/Economist are 2 examples of organizations that are backing into the ""freemium"" business model after offering services for free to build up critical mass for advertisers etc. In any event, great app."
4286,aimee711p,"September 20, 2011",5,"Great app, One of the first iPad only apps I downloaded after getting my iPad, This is an amazing app to access information that you may traditionally view in a browser on a daily basis.  To be able to ""flip"" through the various articles or statuses and see it all presented like a magazine makes me want to read everything available in Flipboard all day long :) A must to download if you haven't done so already."

4288,xbabby95g,"December 11, 2011",5,"Absolutely Brilliant I don't think I've ever written a review before, but Flipboard deserved one. This app eliminates all of my social media and news apps as it combines all of them into one sleek app. You can tell the developers took their time with this one. My only complaint would be the start-up time but I'm sure it would be faster if I had a 4s instead of a 4. "
4289,NowIHatePhoneFlicks:-(,"December 25, 2011",4,"Really Good, Close to Great Love the interface. Very clean and easy to use. Change three  things and I will give it 5 stars. 1.) add more pages to hold all subscriptions, not just four pages.  2.) Rotate page based on orientation of iPhone, now only vertical layout. 3.) All pages should be in mobil view rather the a link to the full page (and I do realize this is probably not Flipboard's fault)."
4290,JT92101,"December 17, 2015",1,"Killed my favorite app Haha, Flipboard still milking and coasting on some cheesy ""page-flipping"" novelty bling, while the app truly stinks for its intended purpose!"
4291,RussWesty,"December 21, 2015",4,"Probably the best news app with some nits This is a very good app, probably the best news app I've used.  It is great but not perfect.  My biggest complaint is the inconsistent way it opens stories.  Some are within flip board, while others essentially open a browser with the story in it, along with all the ads and other things I don't want.  There is no way of knowing ahead of time how it will open. Kind of a pain.  Otherwise a solid news app."
4292,rafa.c,"December 22, 2015",5,Great app for news readers and curators! Flipboard is a fun and easy-to-use app that provides an excellent reading experience. It's provides multiple and tailored news channels and topics for a customized experience. 
4293,Bird watcher 759,"March 2, 2016",5,"Love it One place to get all the news, info, etc. I want. Very convenient. Only drawback is that you have to be aware that since many of the sources are blogs or non-traditional news sources the information isn't always accurate. This is especially  true for healthcare and other scientific articles.  Lastly, many of the news articles seem to have a liberal bias. That said, overall it's a great app."
4294,jhowardm,"May 15, 2016",5,"Broken in so many ways Latest version just crashes on iPad. You need restart iPad to get app to work. Once I got the app to run, I logged in with my FB account and no news stories show up. When I go to my account, I see that I'm following the same topics as usual, so the app is just broken."
4295,Definition by character,"October 8, 2016",1,Option to save full articles for offline reading I like this app a lot but please give us option to save full articles with images and all for offline reading. We can then manage space on our devices. I don't like the way instaper saves articles as I loose the awesome user experience. Let it be an option. I want to be able to go into technology section and save articles for offline reading as they are on flipboard. I don’t want the images and video stripped off. We can choose to download over wifi. Just put it as a choice then we can choose. That’s the one drawback for me using Flipboard all the time.
4296,Hrmph!,"October 27, 2016",2,"More crashes There've been a lot more crashes than previous versions, trying to read an article or two and the app just crashes, leaving me to find the article all over again. Have deleted and re-installed the app, crashing continues. 2 stars until crashes are resolved and app becomes a lot more stable and reliable as it has been in the past."
4297,X2F0111,"February 14, 2017",1,"Ruined I don't leave many reviews. I gave this update a chance and it has proven to be the epitome of change for the sake of change. It is possible to make something that needs very little to no improvement, and that's how Flipboard USED TO be. It just worked. Simple, streamlined, showed me topics I wanted to read about, etc."
4298,DanJay67,"February 16, 2017",1,"Hate being force fed Flip board is a decent enough app, but the fact that you can not control the news being fed to you is a major deal breaker. You can add sources that may fit your needs and wants, but removing news sources that are 'pre-fed' in to the app can not be removed. This makes this app nearly unusable to me. I have dozens of topic and sources selected to tailor my FB, and yet the pre canned sources always seem to take preference. They claim this has to do with RSS feeds of their sources which they can not control. I find this completely implausible. This app is useless with out the control to feed what you want and stop having garbage you don't."
4299,Rani6666,"May 31, 2017",5,"Never looked back I tried Flipboard 2 years ago .... and never looked back. Being a news junky I find the selection and curation of topics immensely helpful. The large variety of sources and thus points of view is a major plus. And all of that through a single, simple interface. Just can't ask for more. Beats any social media feeds and news services I have run into."
4300,CRASHClint,"April 1, 2013",4,"Love it. (Minus one bug in this version) Probably my most used app. I use it for all sorts of news/web/RSS feeds. Everyday after work (and sometimes during) I catch up on the days happenings all in one place. Easy one-thumb navigation. Overall... Awesome app! But can you please fix the ""open on Safari"" button. It does not work, link seems to be broken in the latest version."
4301,JStraitiff,"August 23, 2013",5,"Well designed This app is very well built. The interface is beautiful and easy to use. The ""flipboard"" style navigation is very productive and easy to use. Unlike many others, Facebook integration is very well done. Sorts out the garbage and turns Facebook into not only a social network but a viable source of news. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for news from a variety of sources."
4302,lal1234!,"September 20, 2013",5,"Love it! When I first got my ipad mini a friend told me I HAD to get Flipboard. It is probably my favorite app. I love getting my news on Flipboard. I'm a foodie and love being able to follow food blogs and discover recipes (which I've tried). I also love being able to save articles, recipes, and anything interesting to read later or look up later. Have I said love too many times? Perhaps, but I mean every one. A great app."
4303,Ducttapeaholic,"October 11, 2013",5,Use it every day My favorite content on the Internet funneled into a neat little package and updated constantly. 
4304,Samuel Lehman,"March 15, 2014",4,"Excellent newsreader This is one of my absolute go to apps, and is consistently capable of discovering articles I am interested in reading. Two things could be improved. First, it's confusing to figure out how to create new curated magazines or whatever, and second, it's somewhat annoying that if you accidentally flip back out to the main screen and then back into a particular section, you've lost your place. These are but minor gripes with a fantastic app."
4305,Ozlander,"October 2, 2014",5,"iOS 8 bugs tarnishing the experience Before iOS 8 I would give this app five stars. Not only is it one of my favorite ones and I open it at least once a day but I also have it in all my Apple devices. Now seems iOS eight started, I'm getting flickering, some pages are not opening the right way and it's a lot slower to upload. Please fix it. I can't live without my Flipboard."
4306,yipjumpmusic,"November 22, 2014",5,"SuperFantasticRadReadingMachine I use this app every single day. So much better than bookmarking websites on your browser, or copy and pasting URLs in your notes. The app itself is beautiful, easy to use, allows you to read the text from ""Pocketed"" websites/URLs in such a simple and beautiful format. I could not recommend this app enough or give it all the praise it deserves. GET IT NOW.....or at least just try it once."
4307,Grandesid,"December 29, 2014",2,Slick but content is weak I am a Zite guy but am really trying to use Flipboard since Zite is on death watch. Sometimes the swipe gestures are inconsistent (sometimes you scroll up/down within a story and sometimes you flip left/right).
4308,Izzzzzzyyyyyy😘,"August 22, 2015",5,"Quick way to get YOUR kinda news The set up takes a while, but only because it pins down your kind of news. No more surfing for news that matters to you! Love love love it! Flip through stories and read what you like. I like the easy navigation through different stories from different sources. A must have for those that want news that matters to them."
4309,Obadelward,"October 5, 2015",5,"It's the news! What can you not like about it I am not a voracious consumer of news, but the stories that Flipboard provides are varied, multifaceted. It's like people who read the news are constantly bringing up the stories for your attention. You can criticize their bias but you cannot deny that the perspective is better."
4310,ScottW60,"July 21, 2010",5,"Almost Great - with Promise I have had good success with this app since installing it today around noon. Twitter worked immediately. And I got the Facebook ""overload"" message for a few hours, but that is working now. "
4311,RaymRey,"August 4, 2010",5,"My New Fav App. Better than Pulse, worth the wait! This app really is great! It takes all the news that I read everyday and puts it in a simple and beautiful package. The built in browser loads full articles with no wait time for a fully immersive experience. This app is several times better than the Pulse app which I paid $5 for! If anyone is interested in Pulse try this first, you won't be disappointed!"
4312,Mestrong,"June 1, 2011",4,"Wonderful app!!! This app is wonderful and makes me want to check Facebook and all other news feeds every five minutes. The only complain I have is that sometimes videos do not play properly. Also, it would be nice to have a way to post on someone's wall from within this app. Until now I have been able only to write on my own wall or to comment other people's posts. I could not find a way to put a brand new post on my friends wall."
4313,Aftgnitec,"August 29, 2011",3,"Seems to lose images after ads Some articles have full page ads on about the third page.  When you flip past them, all the graphics are gone.  There's text, but half the page is blank.  Sometimes there are empty picture frames too.  Lonely Planet ads are particular offenders.  Tried to report it, but the website required me to set up a new account (""Get Satisfaction"", or other accounts I don't have) to do so.  I've got enough accounts.  Why couldn't I just give you the email I use?"
4314,SpiceRak2,"January 9, 2012",5,A beautiful culmination of technology and design 👍👍 I heard a lot of buzz about Flipboard without really knowing what it was. I thought it was just another social networking site and I have plenty of those...I bumped into the app while in the store and decided to take a closer look. I haven't looked back!
4315,NewAux,"April 3, 2012",3,"Designed well, not for me This app is beautiful. It is designed well and I can understand how people would enjoy it. The Facebook and twitter features I didn't enjoy. Id much rather just use the stand alone apps. "
4316,Mr.Grimme,"May 8, 2012",5,"10 stars if I could give them This quickly became my favorite and most used app. Every morning, I check my messages, email and then turn to Flipboard while I have my morning coffee. It's better on the iPad than iPhone, but even the iPhone version is fantastic. Do yourself a favor, download this app. If you hate it, you're crazy, but you can always delete it. You won't delete it."
4317,Don't Tread On Us,"November 26, 2012",5,"Excellent This app is very well presented, both graphically and content wise.  You have a wide selection of various sources of information to draw upon and is updated regularly.  I suppose my only complaint is relative to the amount or, lack thereof , of conservative news sources (although that is nothing new in this community).  Otherwise, it is an extremely appealing app in its presentation of news articles.  Great job!"
4318,BlakeBishop7tx,"November 18, 2015",5,"Perfect A great way to stay informed on every topic that interest me. Recommend this for every one! Only problem is with the new update. Often times I try to open an article and it prompts me a message that says can't load, tap to refresh. I also have full service and all my other apps work just fine. Probably just a bug that needs to be fixed."
4319,Game N00b,"June 17, 2017",3,"O.K. I don't usually write reviews but since this developer seems to be paying attention, I would like to say something with the hope of them reading. I just want to say that I am a long time user of this app and I used to use it daily to get all my news and information. But, these days I find myself suing it less and less with the new update and I'm not sure why. I think I just don't enjoy the update. If I could recommend something I would suggest looking at previous versions like 3.0 and the like."
4320,Troll100,"December 1, 2012",5,"Great app, but I have two suggestions! I really live flipboard!  It is a phenomenal app that allows me to arrange my social networks in a way that is very entertaining.  It is especially great on the large screen of the iPad!  I have a suggestion that I think many people would enjoy however.  I would appreciate it if You could also add Instagram and Pinterest to the options! I hope you consider!  With best regards, Garrett"
4321,BACinci,"January 7, 2013",5,Great way to keep up with the news I use it every day to keep track of a variety of news sources.  Grouping articles into categories by interest works great and it is far better than reading any one news agency's website.  It is a great way to get political articles from both sides of the spectrum.  If you only want political articles leaning a certain way just choose the appropriate websites.
4322,kurt,"March 28, 2013",5,"Don't like the new version... I'm bothered by the graphics of the new version. I don't like the swipe graphic. It is too responsive. I also don't like the in between graphics that you see when you choose a section. There is no way to actually access those, and they go by quickly, so it bothers me. Why do programmers have to change things??"
4323,tshua,"April 12, 2013",4,"love flipboard but love Himalay Reader even more Loved Flipboard for reading neews feeds, but then I want to read more than the few top news. I want to read NY Times, The New Yorker, The was washington post. "
4324,LR Banker,"May 6, 2013",4,"Great App!! This is an awesome app. I've never had any problems with this app & and it is my go to for everything from News, politics, sports, and anything else I'm interested in at the moment. The only downside I see is that in the politics ""window"" most of the media coverage comes from ""left of center"" sources (i.e., NYtimes, huffpost, Salon, MSNBC). I understand the influence of the news outlets but would love to see more perceived independent sources as well. All in all one of my favorites....keep up the good work!"
4325,Arief Priowahono,"August 24, 2014",5,"I think there's a bug in the 2.3.6 ver Flipboard alwas has been my favourite app since the first time it's launched. But the recent version has been bugging me out, possibly caused by bug. I couldn't open the news I'm interested. Always a blank page. So if I'm still interested, I should read it later in my instapaper or open it in Safari. Please fix this, so that I could make U my favourite app again."
4326,Kellbelle9828,"October 10, 2014",5,"So Enjoyable, So Refreshing The flipboard picks are my favorite and I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to find well written articles, largely without a huge political bias, and certainly informative.  Best of all, it's not the repetitive muck you get in cable TV but diverse choices around the world. So glad I have this option. News has become a choice again for me every morning instead of something I dreaded."
4327,^Sunshine,"November 6, 2014",5,"Love it. This app is definitely my most used one, everyday. This update really makes a lot of great improvements and I find myself loving flipboard even more. I really like how all of your feeds are on one page now, how well done the ""Daily Edition"" is, and just how pretty the overall design is. Thanks for pushing out another great update and for once again standing a head and shoulders above the competition!"
4328,Haya_r,"December 12, 2014",5,"Turned me a Voracious reader This app has been wonderful. I have a very low threshold for ads on apps and would delete them when I see that the app dev is pushing the ad to my face. Surprisingly, this app makes the mags and the ads tolerable for me. This has actually made me notice some of the ads. Making it topic wise makes it read through the partisan BS that one can find in certain mags. Good one, dev !"
4329,Frittitwampus,"March 3, 2015",5,"Not sure I'm getting what I'm looking for Ok, Zite will likely segue into Flipboard so I started using it. The topics seem to be very narrow and I haven't figured out how to get the feed I'm looking for. Instead I have to branch off into different magazines that don't seem to provide as well of a rounded collection of view points as I would like. Also, the advertisements often get stuck and I can't read the article."
4330,PanAmKate,"March 21, 2012",5,"Only News App I Need After downloading Flipboard, I deleted all my other news apps (and there were many). This app brings the news to you in a easy to navigate format with almost every news outlet available, too numerous to list. If your a news junky, you should try this one, it's free, it's stable, it's well designed, it updates regularly and it offers endless sources of news."
4331,iMikeMinotaur,"March 26, 2012",5,"Greatness! I use this regularly and it is absolutely wonderful on my 3rd gen iPad. One small thing that I would change. And it's really nit-picking: Higher res imagery on the cover page with the panning when the app starts up. Besides that, this app really shows off the beautiful new retina display. Love the interface too. Easy to use and the flip animations add a classy touch that gives the app life in a strange way. Try it now!"
4332,andirrashi,"April 9, 2012",4,"Amazing but this version crashes sometimes ... No doubt that this application is somewhat magical and it truly changed the way I used to get news. I only do have one concern and it is related to this current version. Sometimes is crashes (although not very often). The previous version was perfect, it never crashed for me but this one probably contains a bug ... So, please developers watch out for that bug; otherwise it simply is perfect."
4333,Ken Tucker,"April 11, 2012",5,"Description does not do it justice My initial thought of the product from the description was ... ""probably will be a waste but is free so it won't hurt to try it"".  This is by far my new favorite one stop informational app!  Outside of the standards like mail it is probably one of the only apps I go into everyday.  I would go as far as to say I actually look forward to starting this app each day.  The simple pleasures of life :-)"
4334,mpgamer,"April 19, 2012",4,Favorite iPad app is even better on iPhone I love the iPhone version of flipboard. I downloaded it the day it launched but I'm writing this many months later as it become an indispensable app for me. 
4335,werdna92,"April 26, 2012",5,"Best Social/News App by far Greatest app I know such a beautiful design and usefulness . I use it to link all my news and social things together in one place. Wake up in the morning and go to this app, and done I've checked my Facebook twitter cnet CNN and all other news I check daily. I want Facebook to be a little more interactive maybe they can update for a liking and commenting maybe even posting things."
4336,bobbiblu,"August 4, 2012",5,"Great app for tumblr! What an excellent app! I d/l'ed this just to use w/ google reader but found it works great for tumblr too probably better then most tumblr apps I kno. I love that I can view, comment, reblog or like any type of post & not have the app crash on me just 10 - 20 post in! Overall this is great for viewing most if not all types of social sites srsly If I didn't love my current twitter app so much I'd ditch it for this!"
4337,eixam.t,"September 22, 2012",5,"Awesome app There's ton of news under every possible category, links a variety of social networks although it is formatted differently I think since my fb page is blank when clicking on with this app. Not to mention you can listen to music straight from this app not music in your library but different ones sort of like a radio. I like it. Combined everything usefully together."
4338,Clearly Thrilled,"November 20, 2012",1,"Latest update ruins google reader If you are using google reader, the latest update will make it so the story summary in the pages is wrong. It takes the first few words from each paragraph so it's impossible to read or use. You need to tap the article to expand it to see it properly."
4339,Supremo19,"November 26, 2012",5,"Beautiful, easy, powerful Somehow with the iPhone 5 screen, I maybe like the iPhone version of this app even more than the iPad version. The layout is incredibly beautiful, it's easy to find new and interesting sources, it's very powerful in being able to browse articles, share, view in browser etc. I used Pulse for a long time but the beauty of this app has made this my primary newsreader."
4340,Luvbugg868,"July 28, 2010",5,Be patient..geez The wait is only two days and they email you every step of the way.
4341,Shunqun1,"July 31, 2010",5,"Wonderful App! Just want to say thanks, this app has brought me a whole new experience of twitter which would be hard to obtain in any other twitter client. Operation is smooth with little stress. Only wish if you could retweet with comments from the actual page, currently I am forced to go back to echofon on my iPad to do this. Other than that, I am so pleased and would like to share my experience with my Japanese friends."
4342,derring dodette,"August 7, 2010",5,"THE way to look at live content Time to stop talking about launch hiccups, and move on to this elegant, useful app for viewing just about anything you are interested in.  An imaginative page layout, almost-instant response, and beautiful, fluid page animations. I hadn't used this for ten minutes before I had added Twitter, some news feeds, and placed it in pride-of-place in one of the 4 coveted dock spots on my iPad. Excellent!"
4343,Beakler,"December 4, 2010",3,"Great, but flawed First off, this is a solid app.  I really love trying to use it, but it is flawed. "
4344,Ebakermusic,"July 18, 2011",5,"I'm officially addicted! This is one of the best apps out there reading! It puts all my favorite news sources, rss feeds, blogs, Facebook, and Twitter all in one very clean well designed place. I only wish they had a version for my iPhone! I used to be a Pulse News user but Flipboard definitely has a better user interface! Sorry Pulse but there's no going back after finding Flipboard! I recommend this app to anyone and everyone!"
4345,MPNYPDFBI,"December 28, 2011",5,"Awesome! So far, I think this application is absolutely wonderful! Now I don't have to switch from app to app to get the latest news - I can read articles on watch videos on international news, travel, technology, entertainment - all in one place! The news sources include popular, reputable organizations as well as more obscure ones for local or specialized info. Flipboard is easy to use and surprisingly addictive :) I love it!"
4346,Uzeus,"April 1, 2017",3,"Current version is huge step back in reliability! The app now, while running the most current iOS update, keeps hanging up. It will often just stop letting you swipe to the next article and it almost always fails to play the audio of imbedded videos until you close the app and reopen. Need to implement some QC protocols. Not sure if it was an update from the developer or an iOS update that broke it, but it's making me look to other apps when I have been a loyal user for years."
4347,Aberkow,"April 5, 2017",1,"Nice design, terrible content I've been using flipboard since v1. Everything up till now was going along just fine imo. Now, the design's nice, but the content's a mess. "
4348,Kurt's Krap,"May 7, 2017",5,Still the best This app is one of two essentials I must have on my iPad (slob with Feedly). 
4349,TheRealSuperBrad,"May 15, 2017",5,"Best Multi-Functional News and Hobby App to date Whether you are left wing, right wing, progressive internationalist, statists, or liberty loving individual, or wanting to follow up on your favorite hobby or news topics Flipboard is the best app to gather all of your news sources. Flipboard maximizes my time in reading about current affairs on my iPhone and iPad in an instant. Twitter and Facebook access also makes everything a cinch! Try it today! 😂"
4350,DimmaGold,"March 30, 2013",4,"Used to love this app I've been using flipboard since it first launched and think that it's an amazing app with a lot of potential. Sadly, I don't think this new update is all that great. The plus button takes away from the design, especially on the iPhone where it is just plain ugly, and the new magazines feature seems, well, empty. I'm moving my review down from five stars, hope you guys think of a more aesthetic way to add the magazine feature"
4351,Milomindrbindr,"April 16, 2013",5,"My favorite newsreader, by far. I've tried a majority of the other newsreaders and I always come running back to Flipboard for its beauty, simplicity and ease of use. My only gripe is I'd love to have a night-mode setting for white text on a black background. Feedly does this, but it just misses the mark on almost everything else, so I'll stick to this with the hope it becomes an option down the road."
4352,icedoutdesi,"June 15, 2013",5,"Flippin Awesome! There are apps that you have on your iPhone that you never know when they'll come in handy, there are apps to keep you entertained for 7-10mins at the most, - and then there is Flipboard. I find myself constantly using it, spending countless number of minutes/hours reading about stuff I'm interested in. Definitely makes my iPhone worthy of being called a ""smartphone"" !"
4353,O'Brien J.,"October 23, 2013",5,"Best app ever. This app is one that I always recommend to everyone, it has a flawless display and brings current news to your fingertips. Including but not limited to magazines you have to pay for. If you want to get the most out of it sign in to twitter and Facebook. Doesn't hurt that when I read something I know my significant other will enjoy I can just add it to my created magazine."
4354,Airily out,"September 7, 2014",5,"Best App I use this app multiple times a day to keep up on breaking news, technology, physics news, etc etc. Like many other reviews I would like the content to be refreshed more often but that's a small price to pay for such easy access to information I am interested in following. I encourage everyone to give it a try as I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"
4355,Longtime Flipboard User,"September 16, 2014",2,"Stupid Ads I felt compelled to write this review on Flipboard's latest app update on Apple iOS because, frankly, the ads that it's developers have added to the bottle of every article stink. These ads are annoying, obnoxious, and do the exact opposite of advertising because readers like me hate seeing the same annoying ad pop up and flash every time I want to read. Please eliminate these ads or at least make them less intrusive to the Flipboard reading experience. This has been a fantastic app otherwise throughout the years, so I'd hate to see it marred by this bad update."
4356,Thezaika,"November 5, 2014",5,"Great up, could improve multiuser accounts I am using the app regularly and it a very convenient way to read the news from multiple sources. What i would improve is if several users use it (me and my husband) and want to send an article to Twitter or other social media it does not let use switch between different social media accounts. In a convinient and easy way."
4357,vols87,"December 10, 2015",1,"Flipboard is no Zite The reasons have all been mentioned in other reviews. Quite simply, Zite was a great app and one I used several times a day; I almost always found something of interest. Flipboard is a poor replacement and does not hold my interest. I tried it before when Zite was sold and deleted it.  I recently tried it again after Zite was shut down - I will delete it as it is such a weak alternative. "
4358,Thebomb556,"December 22, 2015",5,"My most used app I use this app every time I wake up, and every time I go to sleep. Flipboard has tailored the content so that I end up spending hours every day reading interesting news stories, although there is a lot of noise sometimes (articles I clearly don't want to read)."
4359,WeedMonkey,"February 2, 2017",1,"Tired of Flipboard's political bias It seems like a disproportionate amount of politically biased stories find their way onto my Flipboard feed. There can be one story out of five on the website of a content provider that is political, but that one story—and no or few others—find their way onto my FB feed. "
4360,Dosh80,"September 15, 2011",5,One of the best apps out there! I stumbled across Flipboard in the app store not long after getting my iPad and wasn't really sure what it was and how I would use it and almost didn't download it. I'm so thankful I did!
4361,w4bb17,"December 7, 2011",5,"Works great! App works great! I'm impressed how they were able to make it very functional and fluid on the iPhone. Have always been a huge fan since the app first came out on the iPad. They experienced some technical issues earlier today due to the overwhelming demand. This probably wasn't expected, but since then the app is 100% up and running. Just an indication of the type of commitment that exists."
4362,jozefd1,"December 9, 2011",5,"Almost great alternative to Tumblr It is great to go through Tumblr posts without it freezing/crashing. The Tumblr app for iOS is the only one that does that. The other OS is very stable. Why I say it's a ""Almost"" great alternative is that you cant post your own stuff onto Tumblr but that is alright. Most of us just reblog/like. It is just a refreshing feeling going through Tumblr posts without any issues on my iPod Touch :)"
4363,immortalsilver,"December 10, 2011",4,"Best of its kind! LOVE this app!! Best use of twitter topic curation plus the ability to add virtually any type of feed out there. Very fast, fluid interface. Sharing stories works perfectly, unlike many apps that only post a link or leave out the article's picture/thumb preview. I only wish I could flip through more than 4 pages before having to switch over to the list of all my sources. In any case, this rolled about a dozen apps into just one, better app for me."
4364,Alteredego1,"March 17, 2012",4,"Good and bad... First, I like how articles are presented and the interface allows for a natural browsing through articles! It's my favorite so far except for the non-existent landscape support.  Often, text is too small to read articles in portrait.  Yes, I know I can zoom and scroll side to side and scroll down to read an article but landscape would allow me to just scroll down.  I find myself having to leave the app if I want to read said articles."
4365,Patleeanne,"March 18, 2012",5,"One-stop catching up I have found so many interesting articles and videos through Flipboard.  This app is so popular that even Colbert and Stewart offered  their videos in a format other than Flash to meet the needs of the iPad and iPod users.  Could be coincidence, but I think not.  I found that the format of Flipboard is much more user-friendly than any of the websites used by its contributors.  Thanks for the great app."
4366,kim_pham,"April 30, 2012",4,"Procrastinator-approved! I am in love. The only app to enable my procrastination problem while at the same time keep me duly informed and up to date on current events and social media, all in one place."
4367,jbilinski,"May 13, 2012",5,"Flipboard-Just Awesome! This makes the mass data that is what we call our Social media much more palatable and much more interesting. Using the flip page view for articles from news sites, Facebook, twitter and photos from Instagram makes it a pleasure to view and read. This could possibly be the replacement formate for the paper newspaper and magazines that finally works. Guys love it keep up the great work!"
4368,mushrms,"June 26, 2012",5,My all-time favorite app Want to have all of your news in one place? I'm in college and I use Flipboard every day. You'll love it. Keep things simple. I do wish for there to be enough preview pages to see snippets from every source instead of only having four pages with six snippets each (top stories section is great) instead of clicking on Read More to find your list of sources.
4369,valhello,"March 29, 2013",5,"Grey blank screen during start up. I have used this app ever since it came out a couple years ago and its still awesome. However, I get this grey blank screen during start up with the new update and I have to close and restart the app on my iPad 4. Please fix this bug. Im still rating this app 5 stars because the developers are good fixing this app and I know it will be fixed."
4370,Kasekopf,"March 25, 2011",5,"This is a ""must"" for your ipad. Love this app.   I have Google reader, my twitter account and some twitter lists feeding it, along with some of the stock stuff included with the app.   This is the one app I look at everyday.   Presents all the feeds in a nice layout, and makes it easy to look at any articles, videos or pictures in any of the feeds.  You can see a small summary in app, or it takes you to the web.  Just get it."
4371,ArtWindows,"August 25, 2011",3,"Nice but. I really want to like this app. Very nicely done, BUT, unless I'm missing something, it doesn't seem to refresh with latest news and posts.  I go to Facebook and I see messages there that are several days or many hours old, yet when I go to other apps for Facebook they show current messages that are a few minutes old.  Makes me not want to use it yet it is pretty nicely laid out. Just want my recent posts now not 12 hours later.  I hope to solve this frustrating problem."
4372,IzoldaT,"March 2, 2016",2,"Too many ads and it is no Zite I was a Zite user. I loved that app. I moved over to Flipboard because I had no real choice. Sure, I had had a Flipboard account before zite went away, but I almost never used it. It's not a good aggregate of the stories I want to see. And, there are way too many ads. Every time I turn around, just about every time I flip the page I see yet another ad. If I had any choice, I wouldn't use it. Unfortunately, for right now, it's the only one I can use. If the ads went away, or at least were fewer and farther between, I might use it more."
4373,Honu2000,"March 10, 2016",5,"Awesome Of the many news retrieval apps I've tried - Flipboard is the easiest, most logically formatted app I've found. The ability to streamline your stories based on personal interests helps keep the news flow relevant & varied. Only complaint would be that I can't seem to un-flip stories to their appropriate magazines if I make a mistake, despite their tutorials for doing so. Other than that, highly recommend."
4374,Drxns,"August 18, 2016",4,"Great app but ads sometimes annoying Love Flipboard as a way of getting news, articles for leisure. 2 suggestions-- "
4375,Vberman,"October 17, 2016",1,"Typical bias and some bugs I really want to love this app but I found the inherent bias super annoying. I could probably get over that by customizing the app, but I'm finding a lot of bugs. My biggest problem is the inability to share articles. Many of the articles that I try to share, just show up as a giant F with a Flipboard link and nothing about the article. Then I have to go find the article in a browser and share it from there, which I could've done for the first place without the app. Let's try to get some objectivity and give your customers the opportunity to control what they see and fix the bugs!"
4376,Gypsy growls,"January 1, 2017",3,"Can't pinch pictures bigger On a cellphone the tiny postage stamp pictures should allow you to pinch them bigger but you are stuck with whatever size comes up in article. Resizing a photo is a main feature in cellphones, taking it away in the app is counterproductive, I'd rather browse using a browser that allows resizing of text and photos. They acknowledged this shortcoming a year ago after I suggested it via feedback, and still no change. Time for a different news browser."
4377,BerinGY,"January 18, 2017",5,"Love FlipBoard I truly love FlipBoard.  I love the choices I have, the up to date information, pictures etc.  The only reason I rat it a 4 instead of 5 is because of the length of articles.  THEY ARE WAY TOO LONG.  You have to find a way for your writers to cut the length of each article by half.  No one has time to read long articles.  If I did, I would subscribe to the NY Times. Less is much more effective."
4378,Skyfall969,"February 18, 2017",2,"Why only 2 stars?  Because it can be better. Yes, this app deserves 2 stars, for now.  When reading the front page of a newspaper and it continues on page 5, only the continued text shows up on page 5.  On Flipboard, the whole document opens and you have to rescan where you read to and continue.  There is no marker to tell you of the continue point.  Hate it, hate it, hate it.  If I didn't have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal, this would be my primary reading because it's free.  But free seems to mean they don't care, and that's unfortunate."
4379,Bob13tx,"July 19, 2017",5,"Video Ads Annoying I've really been enjoying Flipboard daily for several years to keep up with the national news; however, I become annoyed and don't have the time to view a 30-second ad before being able to watch the video news clip. Before I watch the ad, I'll flip to something else to read. Annoying but not a ""deal breaker."""
4380,Stadiumcraze,"July 9, 2014",5,Best App I've Used In Years Although there are a few things I'd like to see improved this is easily the best app I've used in several years.  To get the most use you should tie your twitter account to it for more personalized news.  I've replaced four apps with this one.  Love it.  I would like to see the ability for the user to combine different similar feeds into single feeds.
4381,Flightdevildoc,"August 19, 2014",5,"Great news reading app Enjoy Flipboard.  Elegant transition from page to page. I don't miss the news paper. Recommendation: please include the picture of the individual the article is written about once it  opens. It does not make sense to read about, for example, Henry Coppola when his picture only appears in the vignette but not in the full article.  Otherwise, keep up the good work. Thanks 😄"
4382,mscott976,"March 3, 2015",4,Nice easy to use ap! I started using Flipboard a couple of months ago and find that the more I use it the better I like it.  The ability to customize content and to easily save info for later use is great.  I save a lot of the recipes as well as photography how too's.  If I were to change one thing it would be to add the ability to remove content that I'm not interested in.  Overall it's a great ap that I use daily.
4383,Giabbers,"April 3, 2015",5,"Just what I've been looking for I just wanted an easy way to get the news. CNN served this purpose for a while, but there's only so much content that they offer. Flipboard's home page makes it super easy to not only get news but also tons of other content from a lot of different websites that I was using already. Great concept and the design is super easy to use."
4384,Aridon1970,"September 21, 2015",3,"Great News App, Ad issues I have enjoyed Flipboard for well over a year now, however lately I'm having issues with ads popping up over articles I'm reading with no way to close them.  There isn't an x to be seen.  So I have to back out of the unfinished article and read other articles for a while waiting for the ad to clear out of memory.  It isn't a good experience and I'll lower my rating to one star if Flipboard doesn't fix it soon and switch to Apple News."
4385,Miss V in NYC,"October 12, 2015",5,"My own personal magazine - nice! I love Flipboard. I can curate my own magazine based on my interests and it is constantly updated, so the content stays fresh, making everything new and interesting. I also use Texture by Next Issue and read magazines and newspapers online, so my reading needs are definitely met. It's nice to mix things up and I love being well-informed, so this is another useful tool in my arsenal."
4386,pooksat,"October 21, 2015",4,"Why do so many articles start halfway through? One of my big pet peeves about online articles are the ones that stretch out over multiple pages and require the reader to keep clicking to another page. While this app isn't to blame for this, I frequently find it annoying to click on a headline to find that it links to a page halfway through the article instead of the first page."
4387,Jairuuuu,"November 27, 2015",5,"Everything fixed!!! P.S I would also like to say that when I requested/resurfaced the highly popular opinion that ""likes"" be accessible, Flipboard literally was like ok and added it the next day. Freakin awesome. "
4388,Meiguorendou,"December 22, 2015",5,Terrific information gatherer User-friendly and accessible for organizing and sifting through the mounds of news information out there. 
4389,OrangeMama22,"January 19, 2016",5,"My go/to app So nice to have one app to follow Twitter, blogs, etc. Love having folders to ""flip"" items in. Now flip recipes instead of ""pin."" Sending has gotten better, I think. I can text a tweet & send actually link or message rather than Flip address. Really like how I can switch apps & come back to the point I warned. IG takes you live & you lose your place. Overall, really the most used app for me."
4390,ACarter86,"May 23, 2011",5,So helpful! This organizes everything you want in one place. 
4391,Buddahpundit,"June 7, 2011",5,"Awesome This is exactly why the iPad rocks. Just got this thing as a gift for my 40th from my family and I am normally a total Luddite but this reminds me of when I touched my first Apple product 27 years ago; the mouse on my Macintosh. I have been avoiding technology for a long time now, and finally my wait has been with it. They finally have made something so idiot proof that morons like me can zip through it with total ease. Rock on Apple."
4392,LETS_GO_OAKLAND,"November 6, 2011",5,"Font sizes Thank you, Flipboard developers, for adding the ability to increase the font sizes of articles. I'm among the millions of older iPad users whose declining eyesight requires us to use e-reading devices (as opposed to simply reading printed books and magazines). Unfortunately, many of the big-name magazine apps still lack the font-resize functionality. Flipboard is ahead of the pack in this regard, and is now my go-to app for magazine-style content."
4393,FosterMax,"November 27, 2011",5,"Extremely useful Very handy as it lets you keep many different sources of information together in a couple of customizable pages. Only thing left to be desired is the possibility of having newspaper web sites from languages other than English, it would be more appealing to international audiences. Maybe this feature is there, but I haven't found it. Overall a very nice app."
4394,fgravicle,"December 7, 2011",5,"Amazing, just so amazing. I'm already in love with Flipboard for the iPad, but this still somehow manages to blow my head up. The UI is perfectly intuitive, reading is a pleasure, subtle animations are a delight and the experience is just excellent."
4395,Tuzige,"December 9, 2011",5,"Love it I love this app!  It makes my feeds feel like a magazine, more so than any magazine I've gotten for the iPad. I wish that it had a full text option for the rss feed like some of the readers have, but that's my only small grip. I love how it expands on the articles linked in twitter, making it much more in depth than the 140 characters.  I didn't know this was why I bought my iPad until I started using it n"
4396,Alienraygun,"April 9, 2012",4,"Excellence nearing perfection Flipboard is my favorite iPad app. News, articles for my interests, and Twitter all in a beautiful, well designed,magazine style layout. The page flips are a nice touch. The one negative I have is that it doesn't replace my Twitter client yet. Wishing for easy ways to see only my timeline in chronological order, to reply, to upload my images, etc. if I could give four and a half stars I would. But I give it four stars until the twitter aspect is more comprehensive."
4397,Recklesscole,"May 8, 2012",5,"I love it!!! Not only does Flipboard make everything in your boring life look cool and important like its from a magazine, but it make it easier to go through all your social networks to check news and other stuff. The only thing is that you can't post on your websites like Facebook and Twitter from there I hope they make an update for that because if they do this app would be perfect!"
4398,LaffinAtcha,"July 18, 2012",2,Last Update ruined my Google+ feed I love this app but I do have one issue with it. Since the update I can't flip through my Google+ feed more than a few pages until it literally stops like I've reached the end of my feed. The app doesn't have anywhere for me to send feedback (like a send feedback button) to report issues like this so I am bringing it here. Hopefully this bug gets resolved ASAP because other than this issue flipboard is a great app. Unfortunately since I am an avid G+ user I will only give this app 2 stars until this issue is resolved.

4400,BenjaminBearNY,"March 25, 2011",5,"A beautiful take for the iPad 2 This app is stunningly simple and elegant, bringing your social media and (selected) news together in one gorgeous package.  As it is an aggregator, it would be nice to be able to choose from other media sources but, given the beauty with which it's presented, I understand that they can't simply throw everything into the mix."
4401,Vidhya Prabhu,"August 7, 2014",5,"Fantastic All-in-one Newsreader!!!! This app is brilliant! Everything about it is perfect - from the user-friendly interface to the flipping of articles to the save articles for later. I can't say enough about this app, just freaking awesome.

4402,Boodreax,"November 14, 2014",4,"Serious Flaw I used to like it and use it, but after upgrading devices it asks you to use Facebook or Twitter to sign in. I try and it says I already have an account and it doesn't offer a place to sign in with an existing account. There are plenty of other news apps that work so I'm not going to spend a lot of time jumping through hoops to figure out how to sign in. If it isn't easily accessible then I'm moving onto the next app."
4403,Honest_Ape,"January 14, 2015",4,"It has potential and I know they'll get there I've been a fan of this app since the first talks of it. I am amazed at how well coordinated my news are-from local to around the world and my own social circle. It is my go to app. However, there certain things here and there that could get better with time, so I'm hopeful that the company is looking into how to better the product and make it much more user friendly."
4404,OZZWiiLLD,"May 12, 2015",5,Overall an amazing app! Flipboard has been my source of news for quite some time now. I enjoy using the friendly User Interface and being able to create my own magazines. I also find the array of topics and news sources to be incredible. I would most definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for a vast area of news coverage.
4405,Rassul@buffbrew,"November 24, 2015",5,"Zite was awesome This is a eulogy for zite. I loved zite. I am trying to acclimate to flipboard but I hate flipping. It's gimmicky and unnatural. It feels like a UX based on differentiating itself instead of delivering a UX that the user wants. Give me the option to turn off flipping and I'll use flipboard. I used zite daily, often up to five times a day, as my primary source of news. It was flawless. I never had a problem with it. I'm so sad to see it go."
4406,Thetonzone,"March 15, 2016",2,"It'll Never Be Zite This app has broken through to become my Zite replacement, but it's garbage by comparison. This fumbly and awkward and there's a million buttons to press all the time, and it is not learning what articles I'm interested in at all. Instead of me going into the article to say I like or dislike, just make it an easy swipe. Also I don't want to have to read fifty headlines for something I want to read...and these categories?! Come on! Do the work for me, like Zite did!! It's better than any other alternative I have tried but I will never stop searching."

My main problem with Flipboard is that sometimes you see the same exact story multiple times. That being said, this is one of the better news readers I've found."""
4409,David.Ramirez.Sz,"May 25, 2017",4,"Amazing app but always you can improve it I am veteran user of Flipboard, I think is the best way to read digital content. It is friendly, good integration with social networks and nice desing."
4410,AVargas03,"December 7, 2011",5,"Research I don't understand why people don't do a little research before they start posting these reviews. The people in charge of Flipboard have sent a release saying that their servers are having issues today so that's why the app isn't working...it's the servers acting up...so calm down, it's not the end of the world to where you have to come on here & cry as if somebody stole something from you. Simmer down."
4411,Right2Safety,"December 12, 2011",5,Crashes frequently After each of the last two updates Flipboard crashes to the desktop on my iPad (1). I will be reading an article on Flipboard and the app just closes. The crash problem is more frequent when I move to the complete article on a news website.
4412,JT8675,"January 21, 2012",4,Almost the perfect app! Flipboard has completely changed how I use my iPhone! It accounts for more than half of my iPhone usage now: it's so well designed and completely addicting. I find that I skim a lot less of my social feeds and get a lot more out of them. The only reason I can't give Flipboard 5 stars is that it misses some tweets and Facebook posts. I'd ditch those apps entirely if that gets fixed. Flipboard is a must-have app at a price that can't be beat!
4413,Stash Taylor,"March 19, 2012",5,"Maybe it does something Just got the app. But, can't do anything with it. They have a server demand issue. Reminds me of the Superbowl TV ad where they hope to get customers, and then are overwhelmed. Obviously, they didn't get it, probably because they never explored it with users. They should have anticipated the demand. I guess I will check back in a few days and see what it actually does."
4414,Peter The Freshman,"March 23, 2012",5,Addicted I'm addicted. This app is great for both the iPhone and the iPad.  All this information at my fingertips in an easy intuitive interface that works great and consolidates information through various providers is amazing. It has turned me into an information junky. I can't stop using it. Highly recommended if you want to be the most informed person on the planet.  I'm regretting not hearing about it sooner.
4415,_Kanamit,"January 3, 2013",5,"The best iOS app. Makes reading about virtually anything current a lot of fun. News, Politics, Music, Tech, Gaming, Films etc. Anything you can ever want, straight to your iPhone or iPad from a variety of sources. Even read, comment or just skim through some of your favorite social media apps and websites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in a fresh, stylish, sometimes even preferable view. The app seems perfect as it is. Fantastic."

4417,Grantioth,"May 13, 2013",3,"Beautiful design, however... the majority of the provided news sources are left-leaning. Obviously this is most obvious in the Politics section, but only getting your news from this app will result in getting a very one-sided picture. I've read more Huffington Post articles with this app than any reasonable human being should ever read in their lifetime. I'm actually a bit nauseous from nearly over-dosing on all the partisan BS provided to me by this app. I'm not asking for Fox News, but a little Wall Street Journal or New York Post wouldn't hurt."

I always have grand plans to read my news apps each day but never get past 1. Now when people ask, ""have you heard..."" I can say yes...I have. I can easily scan stories in various areas and those posted to my twitter feed as well. Love that everything is in one place."

With the ability to sync between my iPad and iPhone, share to various social networks, and dig in and discover articles that I most likely wouldn't have when I have the time is great. In my opinion, this is the best news reader app in the AppStore."

I hope they will add multiple pages to add sections. Thank u Flipboard!!"
4422,mgsnyder121,"July 22, 2010",4,"Best There is So Far But More To Do Like many others, I like this app very much.  It is hard to put into words what makes a news app work, similar to explaining to people what makes Apple's products ""just work.""  I have probably downloaded every similar app there is and I can say for sure that this is my favorite.  The only thing missing, however, is the ability to add more sources.  Please add more sources and I will draw a star on my monitor so I can give you six!"

4426,ViaMichael,"March 22, 2016",3,"Zite Lite I was a very happy Zite user. Unfortunately, the quality of news that I received on Zite does not appear on Flipboard. Instead of serious articles, mindless short articles from unknown blogs appear. Sometimes the same bit of news repeatedly appears. Apparently, there is no filter on the quality. Zite did a fine job in that regard."
4427,ridbullo,"March 28, 2016",5,"Data hog, repeated stories The content is ok but a LOT of stories are repeated sometimes three times in a few flips. Animated ads, videos that open themselves and other junk make this app a HUGE data hog. I have noticed my data usage DOUBLING since installing this app. Fine on wifi but be warned if using over cellular. Otherwise you can find a better news app. Dunno why rated so high???"
4428,Carlos Mex,"June 18, 2016",5,"Use it every day This is my favorite app by far. I use it several times a day to check news, recipes, DIY ideas, photographs, goofy stuff, you name it. I created several magazines of my own for personal reference and for sharing with others. I recommended it to family members and even my mom who is not a tech savvy has her own recipe magazines and share links with me all the time. Great app guys!"
4429,Solitood,"August 21, 2016",5,Intrusive pop up ads! I used to really love Flipboard but lately there are new pop up ads that have become a major annoyance. What makes them so bad is that you can't minimize them or click them away so you have to try and read *around* the ad. The ads must take up at least 40% of the page. Seriously?! So sad that Flipboard ruined such a good thing.

It's scarey how well it knows me and what I want and more importantly F"
4431,AronJA,"August 16, 2013",4,"Really great app I use this app everyday to keep up with my technology news and other things.  As a practice I use it every night before I go to bed as well. I really like it and use it on my s4 and iPad. Really like the format and the type of stories showcased. It keeps me in the loop on the things I'm interested in, sometimes I get lost in it because I could read tech news for days lol. Very very good reading a displaying experience on both devices."
4432,Burt Reynoldz,"November 25, 2014",3,"Bad update The new update has made it more difficult to find the sections that I want. Also, it seems that every article, regardless of topic, comes from The Huffington Post. I have no problem with HP, but I used to love Flipboard for the variety, now everything has turned into cheap click-bait tripe with stock photos. Please go back to the old layout and find new sources of content. Also, there should be a way to block Huffington Post articles if I don't want them to appear in my news feed."

4434,Carling C,"December 1, 2015",1,"Bring Zite back!!!! Flipboard has an awkward interface and brings in too many unwanted articles.  I also dislike that it doesn't have an easy way to dislike articles.  Zite seems to occasionally give me naked pictures of women, which as a woman I don't need to see, but Zite allows me to dislike the article and it grays it out.  But Flipboard does not gray it out, even after finding the way to tell it I didn't like the article.  It makes it hard to use this app at work. Please bring Zite back.  It was easy, gave me a ton of new articles every day, and I don't know how I will replace it.  It certainly won't be with Flipboard."
4435,TexMurphy9,"December 15, 2015",5,"Serviceable but too much flipping They did a total disservice to the Zite user base. Flipping per headline is so gimmicky and heavy weight, not to mention the inserted ads. I miss the utilitarian and minimalistic Zite interface. They say they are proud of the integration and that's fine but the interface stinks. Especially for news junkies like myself. I'm moving to other providers until they let me see multiple headlines per page."
4436,Not quite there,"December 22, 2015",5,"Most used App Ever!! Thank you for this. This is the best app on my iPad. The one I use every single day. It's Free, you can learn about all the things you're interested in and all the things you're not! Love being able to create my own world. The only thing I would like is the ability to access word look up (dictionary) while reading an article. Anyway, I love it - don't ever leave me..."
4437,Jipillo,"December 29, 2015",1,About Flipboard. Zite was my most used app.  Hate Flipboard.  It's the interface.  I hate the scrolling/flipping.  Trying to navigate and find like content on Flipboard is a really bad experience.  I finally had to delete the app. 
4438,Gregg853,"January 3, 2016",1,"Still sub-par I used Flipboard initially, but was frustrated that many articles were sometimes weeks to months old. I switched to Zite and was very happy with that app. Then Flipboard bought Zite and announced they were integrating Zite's technology to improve ""their"" experience. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Flipboard has the same old, annoying features - pages not loading, or having to click multiple times on various links to see the article, news stories days and weeks old. I'm finding that Apple News makes a much better replacement for Flipboard. Time to delete this app"
4439,MuveeProducer,"March 11, 2016",5,"Your Fav Topic, Less Junk We publish 9 daily magazines with each having a theme that many follow.

It's the first thing I go to when I open my iPad and I may not get to anything else.  The only drawback, which may be due to my own ignorance is that I have a hard time finding an article that I have moved off of and haven't been able to save items I want to return to."

NONETHELESS keep up the good work guys! It's the most intuitive layout for social media today.

I really enjoy browsing news with Flipboard and recommend it for every iPad owner.

I will continue to use this app and spreading its greatness!"
4447,Michael Huff,"September 2, 2012",5,Hopelessly addicted I was a little skeptical at first and then I heard about this app on The Linux Action Show. It really works! It actually does curate your own personal magazine. I'm a network engineer and the tech news it generates goes surprisingly in-depth. I have recommended this to pretty much everybody. If I could change one thing I'd make the pages actually turn like a magazine. But otherwise I absolutely live it.
4448,leftspin,"March 31, 2013",4,"The ability to create your own mags is incredible Within a few days of creating my own magazine, like-minded people have already subscribed and reflipped my articles into their own magazines.  I have subscribed to their magazines and now we are an adhoc group of curators who collect and ""trade"" articles with each other. Flipboard makes finding relevant articles a team sport.

4451,rustyandrews,"August 4, 2010",5,"Great first version! First off, the whole idea behind this app is brilliant. Both Facebook and Twitter look great in the Flipboard format. However, with pieces such as Twitter post that are 100% text, it makes the page look empty, especially when you have a lot of these on one page. Maybe change font style and size to fill the page? Great job overall though."
4452,Astro Turf,"October 10, 2010",5,Great layout but missing rss feeds Love the layout but all sources are based on Twitter. The result is that most news are old. You get maybe four or five stories per day which is simply not enough to make it worth using. Otherwise is looks fantastic! I love the cover look and the layout of the pages. But without rss feeds it is not offering enough new content per day. Maybe in the next update?

4454,Bill Dempsey,"July 12, 2011",5,"Best RSS and social feed application I prefer the interface on Pulse for reading news quickly, but this application works with far more feeds, so I use both. One thing I really love is the slideshow cover this app creates. I leave it running while my iPad 2 is sitting in the dock on my desk. Since I have the smart cover, I disabled auto lock on the screen. It works great. Nothing beats it for social feeds and regular RSS reading. Five stars!"
4455,Dzeetz,"December 22, 2015",4,"Zite was superior. Zite is gone, so there is no sense in my wishing for it to return.  Flipboard is simply not as adept at fine-tuning for the news that I prefer.  The topics I prefer transferred over all right, but the results seemed to be loaded with things of which I had asked the Zite application to show less.  It is taking longer for me to set this application to my preferences than it did for Zite and I would prefer to still be using the discontinued application."

4457,No nick review,"March 10, 2016",1,Zite was Great!!! Flipboard has a poorly designed user interface and poorly delivers content.  I have tried to find something to like about Flipboard and so far keep coming up empty.  Flipboard has way too much trivial information that makes it difficult to scan the articles quickly.  There is no comparison to the Zite interface which is almost perfect. Zite is very simple and easy to use. Unfortunately Flipboard bought out Zite and shut it down because it works too well.  There are a bunch of new reviews for Flipboard that are all 5 star. Obviously all written by Flipboard employees.   Please bring back Zite!!!!!
4458,Ebd3682,"February 19, 2017",1,"New UX is total garbage Really bummed by this new Flipboard. Still the same tons of ads, but now, relevance to my defined interests is at an all time low. In my ""Nintendo"" page, I got the following three news articles in sequence: GMC automotive, Cam'ron the rapper, and Call of Duty. There's only so many times I can filter results as non-relevant before I give up and accept that nothing is being done with my input. I went through around two dozen pages/flips, and maybe three were Nintendo-related. Time to go back to Apple's News app. Also, why do you need to swipe from edge to edge to change categories? Why not just a directional flick?"
4459,Lookslikeamonkeys,"March 15, 2017",5,"Love it... Flipboard has always been an amazing reading experience. I have it installed on pretty much every device I own and use it everyday.

Try it and you won't regret it."

Finally, the ability to read periodicals I don't subscribe to gives me greater reading power."

It learns what I like to read pretty well, but it also provides so many more options than it used to. The only problem with this app is that it doesn't freeze time so that I could catch up on everything I wanna read."
4468,Fellow Flyer,"December 2, 2015",1,"Would love to like it. I just can't. I so much want to like Flipboard, and I just can't. The interface is neat...and then gets old and in the way after 2-3 minutes. Text formatting is so off-the-wall that it's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get! Sometimes, page flipping doesn't work, so you have to scroll. Sadly, there aren't any discernible clues to this so you learn by clicking some link on the side of the page. "

I'd try Fliboard once in a while, because it was good, if not great. Now, here, in the dying breaths of Zite, I'm trying Flipboard again, only to realize it's just gotten worse! How can you take our Zite away without providing something of at least comparable quality? I'll adjust to new features or a new app, but Flipboard isn't even loading articles anymore. My favorite topics from Zite now have ZERO results in Flipboard. How is this better? I know Zite isn't coming back, but man I wish it would!"

Sorry but Facebook is enough for me and I don't plan on ever tweeting. Cant be difficult to login or share to Facebook just as easy. Second feature I think is crucial is a read later or save option. Great app but those 2 things keep me using Pulse. Beautiful design!"
4474,VioletTaxi,"March 11, 2012",5,"Flip the day away Fantastic app for consuming news feeds, from Google Reader, Twitter, Facebook links and favorite blogs. Curated sections always have new tech articles, film releases, recipes and more. You can always find something new to read here, and if you aren't interested, it's easy to flip on to the next item. Great to look at, easy to navigate, and thoroughly easy to configure and personalize."
4475,LukeTheBook333,"March 15, 2012",5,Simply Amazing. It's a breeze and a pleasure to scan through multiple news feeds and dig into content. Flipboard is my favorite way to read blogs!
4476,Gopal Venkatesan,"March 18, 2012",5,"One of the best iOS apps This is one of the best iOS apps available to keep up with your news, feeds and other things.  I use this app several times daily."
4477,Rhonda Tuman,"March 30, 2012",5,"The BEST! This is the best app I have ever used!  In fact, next to the ipad it is the greatest invention!  It has so many possibilities, if it could be adapted to be used in users projects!  I definitely want to be kept abreast of future opportunities  It is truly outstanding.  Since  it was free, I imagine this was only to entice us when the next app comes out!"
4478,Bobo4255,"March 31, 2012",5,"What you want, just the way you want it! This is my first experience with an aggregator of any sort, but it certainly beats tabbing through multiple open apps when all you want to see is what's new and exciting!  UI is slick and readability is great without having to resize or zoom multiple page formats or text size.  Strongly recommend to compulsive news/social media surfers!"
4479,Dancinghan1,"May 6, 2012",5,"Better than the Facebook app This app is amazing. It loads when you open it and then that's it. You can do all the basic essentials that you do on Facebook. No more load time than you would want or expect. You can pick from dozens and dozens of media outlets and it's all right there in a seamless timeline of news, Facebook, twitter, instagram. This app works perfectly. FB needs to take note."
4480,ImDis,"July 21, 2010",5,"Calm down, people. Excellent app and as soon as they can handle the huge Twitter and Facebook demand the app will be all the better. Give it a little time. You are not the only one downloading this app."
4481,Kevin M. Stieb,"August 11, 2010",5,"Wow. Okay, seriously one of the best apps on the iPad. Love the interface. The only thing I could see making this better is the ability to add your own rss feed and be able to update your status on Facebook. (The built in browser can be used for this, however.) The is THE APP that I show everyone when I show them my iPad. This is easily the best free app on the market. Good work guys, keep it up!"
4482,Db471,"September 9, 2010",5,"Wow!! This is by far the best way to digest written news, sports, and whatever else you want. Just set up a twitter list of all the sources you like, then this app makes it look like a magazine. It's your own personal publication for the things you re specifically interested in. It takes a little bit of setting up with the twitter thing, but i guess that why it's free. To me that is the killer feature."
4483,orktane,"May 23, 2011",4,"Love it to bits but it needs cache limits.. The apps absolutely fantastic however it has an issue in that it just doesn't release its cache of data and images. I recently deleted and re-installed the app, releasing some 2GB of space on my iPad. Now, by iPad's standards, that's an enormous amount of space for temporary caches (also contrast the fact the app itself is just 3MB). I hope we can get a manual/periodic option to expire the app's cache - otherwise keep up the great job. Cheers."
4484,Xtina313,"June 16, 2011",5,"Incredible-a must have! I use google reader and have been wishing for a less confusing way to read my subscriptions. Flipboard has been INCREDIBLE! I can flip through all my subscriptions quickly, and if I want more information on something I see, I can just touch that blurb and the whole article/website opens up in app. Just what I've been waiting for. Thank you!"
4485,Vandage,"December 7, 2011",3,"Pretty but slow I just installed Flipboard for iPhone and while it's esthetically pleasing to the eye, the content takes minutes at time to load, some pages come up with ""no content"", and it is way more time consuming than all my other news and updates apps put together, due to its poor loading. The top news loads easily, but some other sections like entertainment pull up no content at all. Fix the glitches and speed it up, it has the promise of a future 5 star app."
4486,pittbull76,"November 21, 2016",2,"Used to read daily...really miss it. Flipboard turned me into an Apple/Ipad addict. My all time favorite app for several years. I gave up newspapers and magazines in favor of using this app multiple times a day. There is no app to date that fills that hole in my heart. Quality slowly declined with junk and ads to the point where It would crash frequently. Now I can't even get it to load on my old iPad 2 and thus, I'm over it. I won't even open this iPhone version I just downloaded due to the reviews.  It's sad...it was something truly special. *Sniff sniff*"
4487,LJU2012,"February 10, 2017",1,"New version is a bloated turdpile Title pretty much says it all. Designers took a useful app that did one thing really well and larded it up with a ton of crap. Apparently they labor under the delusion that everyone has the compulsive need to share every item of information on multiple social networks and to see inane commentary from people who share everything on multiple social networks. Oh and of course we're all ""curators"" now (hint- no, you're not). Here's an idea for the next iteration: include a slider labeled ""turn off bloat"" that disables all of the useless stuff and makes Flipboard into what it once was- a great news reader."
4488,pevensen,"February 19, 2017",1,New features not on iPad? It seems the new features aren't on iPad. I rarely use Flipboard on my iPhone. I seem to remember Flipboard bringing features only the the iPhone before. Why? 
4489,kurtvrich,"March 19, 2017",3,"Make Legibility Much Better I access Flipboard on my iPhone 6. I have SERIOUS issues with (1) the grey-scale print that all but disappears against a white background and (2) with tiny, often microscopic print which I can't enlarge or make bold. I strongly suggest you add a button or buttons which will enable readers to darken contrast, thicken & enlarge fonts used in your articles. "
4490,Andy Gillette,"June 18, 2014",5,"Everything You Wanted As a developer looking for applications that truest make you life easier and more beautiful is a goal... Well Flipboard has just done that. By integrating all of my social media and news, there is no long a reason to have five applications but just download one. Flipboard's interface is beautiful and the learning curb is extremely small."
4491,Kingdom Rush King,"October 30, 2014",5,"This app did wonders in my life I just wanted to say thank you to the developers of this app. I was in a funk in school, i wasn't doing homework or studying for tests. I was just playing video games. I downloaded this app and it's so interesting and you never run out of things to read. I stopped playing games and now I'm back on track. Just download this app, you'll thank me later."

4494,Johnstip,"December 22, 2015",5,An Excellent Everyday User I use Flipboard everyday to get news and the information on a variety of subjects that interest me. The collection of articles is very informative and educational. I highly recommend this app to anyone is interested in the news and being informed on topics that interest them. You will never miss information that you want to read.
4495,Fgrocker1,"June 16, 2016",5,"Has stood the test of time in the App Store Been a long time user since iOS 5 on iPhone and iPad and can say that Flipboard is hands down the best app for news, magazines, blogs all wrapped into one. Great to see how they've evolved over the years and continue to have the best curation process for the stuff that matters most to each unique user. Thanks for not selling out and never giving up!"
4496,Zermab,"September 5, 2016",2,"Inferior Flip board bought Zite and is totally inferior to the original app. FB continually show the type of story you indicate you do not want. For example, I live in Wisconsin and I want the news about Wisconsin, but all I get from FB is football. No matter how many times I indicate I want LESS stories about football - all I get is football stories. The rest of the app is just as inadequate. Some stories have headlines, but when you open to read more, there is no story just a headline. Very frustrating if you are interested in getting more than headlines."
4497,SierraLove,"September 18, 2016",5,Love this app! It's my daily go to. With limited time to catch up on what's trending. This app allows for customization and puts it in a format that is user friendly. Love the updates and continued development. Wishlist-allow for more thumbnails pages on selected news categories to display. I want to flip and see all my news content selection thumbnails. Keep up the great work.
4498,Travieboy,"September 29, 2016",5,"My favorite app! This is my favorite ""non-work"" app!  I have 8 of my own magazines and I read, save and share the info that I want to see!  What's nice is most of the time I can get the same info from numerous sources which provides a filter to what our media shares with the public.  No need to watch or listen to the horrors our news channels continually share over and over and over!"
4499,Penmanchip,"October 17, 2016",4,"Your life. With curation. As if I had minions culling thru the vast universe, finding tangents and unexpected moments for my own personal bemusement.

4500,CowtownGirl76,"June 11, 2012",5,Great way to preview lots of content No ads makes this one of the best free apps put there.  
4501,Flipboard critic,"August 19, 2012",4,"Crash report This is a great app, however it crashes consistently when I flip through Canadian-based news such as from The Vancouver Sun, The Province, The Calgary Herald. It seems to occur after you try to view your 2nd news posting. I might be a small minority of all the flipboard users but I wish they would fix this as it's really annoying to have to restart the app and go back to the place where I was reading from."
4502,Masx1584,"November 26, 2012",5,"Simply Great! I didn't know that reading content on the iPhone could be this engaging. Very intuitive, never crashes and very elegant; My favourite app on the iPhone ever. I have deleted a lot on my reading app and now use Flipboard for all my reading engagement including status feeds from Facebook and Twitter. I even dedicated a status on Facebook professing my love for Flipboard. Thanks for such a beautifully made app."
4503,GaBulldawg87,"November 27, 2012",5,"Awesome news app I just have to say guys, this is probably my favorite app i have. I use it every single day, multiple times a day. Its by far one of the best NEWS apps out there if not the BEST. My favorite thing about it is when the news articles have videos with the article. Put more videos with the articles and it will be the best by far. Keep the updates coming."
4504,Robustm,"November 27, 2012",5,"Best app on App Store. Hands down. I usually never write a review for an app as I loose interest in that app very soon or the app fails to entertain me after a while. I have been using this app since it was released and never disappointed me. Simple UI, great way to present the data and excellent feed choice makes it a goto app for me when I start my iPhone, and on top of it it's free! What else you can ask for!!!"
4505,micallef31,"January 15, 2013",4,"Missing one thing When trying to view articles, I have to select ""view on web"", then once that loads ""open in safari"" to gain access to an avenue to easily read text (like ""Reader"") as articles from web have very small text inside Flipboard, and no option to view in even landscape mode. I think this is the only thing this app is lacking: ease of reading content. Otherwise...INCREDIBLE design."
4506,mariosundar,"April 16, 2013",5,"This is how it's done As LinkedIn's social media guy, I experience social apps all the time and I've gotta say this is probably one of the best iPhone apps created specifically with the iOS platform's strengths in mind. "
4507,RachaelPfanz,"April 28, 2013",5,My favorite app ever!!! ;) I use Instagram and twitter a lot. It always annoyed me having to go back and forth between the two apps. With flipboard now they are all in one app next to each other. I like the layout like a magazine and also how you can add things to your own magazine. Best app ever for people who use multiple social networking apps and get tired of jumping back and forth.
4508,DZ2008,"January 8, 2014",4,Great app but need more improvement in loading without crashes. Loved it but would love it more if you allow me to copy the text anywhere in Flipboard and allow me to share to Facebook group wall or someone's wall beside my wall... That will give you 5 stars!
4509,Preston181,"April 27, 2014",4,"Great app, but it needs filter controls I really like Flipboard. It's one of my most used apps. The one thing it is lacking is filter controls. I want the ability to filter out the feeds in each section that I don't want. "
4510,IIIChrisIII,"January 24, 2012",5,"Absolutely Awesomw App!!! I downloaded Pulse and that it was the best news aggregator ever. But because of the reviews I had to try this and it is simply amazing. The UI is so clean and appealing and very easy to navigate. The latest stories are always updated. One thing I liked about Pulse was you could see a preview, but it's worthless when there's never any new stories. Excellent app!!!! So glad I tried it out."
4511,Jamesb959,"March 16, 2012",5,Love this app!! This is one of my fav apps! I used it all the time in both the iPad and iPhone. 
4512,ProducerBen,"March 19, 2012",5,"Revolutionary I've heard a lot about Flipboard. Now that I have an iPad I see why. In short, it culls all the links from all your social media streams and other sources that intuitively know what you are probably interested in into one place. The UI is lovely and makes it fun to experience a new way of reading and consuming media. Best app I've seen anywhere as someone with a decade of experience in media. Bravo!"
4513,MotorDetroit313,"March 19, 2012",3,"Great UI but not efficient to use The user interface is gorgeous. 6/5 stars. But i subscribe to many many RSS feeds through Google Reader. So if I want to see them, it's virtually impossible to flip through so many pages. I have to use an app called Reeder for that (yes two E's). Reeder is WAY more efficient for lots of RSS feeds. Please consider to offer some kind of efficiency mode for RSS feeds. The pictures are nice and the page flipping is tons of fun, but you can't really get past what is essentially the cover of a magazine with this app."
4514,Redwagon76,"March 27, 2012",5,Fix cover stories. Should be able to tap the cover story to read it. If I see an older cover story I want to read I have to guess which channel it was on and track it down. The cover story channel is a joke. I have never found the story I wanted to read in that channel. Easy fix and then this app would be 100% useful. As it stands I'm left extremely frustrated.
4515,TonyCTusa,"March 31, 2012",5,"My 'Go To' app! I have had Flibboard installed on my iPad for quite some time and I recently 'rediscovered' it.  I have taken the time to add the content that is important and interesting to me including the news, social sites and geeky tech stuff and this app puts it all together in a beautiful and extremely user friendly and functional design. It is a joy to use and a great way to start the day :)"
4516,CaptainCrash,"April 6, 2012",5,"Great News App Flipboard has been a great app for me to use to catch up on news from multiple sources throughout the day. The UI is intuitive, fun to use, and highly functional. The problem with a lot of news catchers is that they encourage scanning headlines and reading very little. With Flipboard, active effort is required to get through stories, so it actually becomes a more productive app."
4517,MalcomGTX,"April 8, 2012",3,"Pretty good but needs better Google Reader support It's difficult to mark as read unless you actually load the article fully... Which wastes bandwidth and is a 1-2 second time drain. There Is an option to have all marked as read but then marking as unread still requires you to load the article, but it doesn't even remember and instead marks everything as read.... Pretty terrible. Otherwise I absolutely live the interface, it just needs better handling of read/unread."
4518,esanchez49,"May 7, 2012",5,The iPad app everyone should have and will enjoy Flipboard was designed for the demographics that are buying iPads. Perfectly executed layout and seamless integrated social media links for twitter and Facebook. The layout for twitter and Facebook is innovative in itself. The headlines you are looking for and the BEST way to stay up to date on social media. I find m self opening Flipboard at least 5 times a day.
4519,mkidd,"May 22, 2012",5,Give it a try! This app made me look at Facebook in a new light... I now am using it to rediscover Facebook. And I love the new way to explore Twitter... Giving you more than just links to read the articles attached to the tweets it allows you to continue your journey through twitter with more information from each tweet....by showing the entire article that is attached to a tweet.
4520,Austin Aggie,"July 31, 2010",5,"Amazing app - worth the wait - changes the way I view content Like many of the reviewers I was frustrated that I could not immediately access the site, but I would rather wait than have spotty coverage.  This is truly an amazing, intuitive presentation of the content.  This is different than most of the other reader type applications with much less effort."
4521,Mr. Beaudreaux,"July 31, 2010",5,Bad launch but completely worth the wait I was as frustrated as anyone else when I first got this app and could not get to my Facebook or Twitter data. Now I'm in and I have to say that Flipboard is the best way to experience Facebook BY FAR. It's as if so e one came out with a pleasant photo glossy magazine that was filled with my friends updates and pictures. You really need to get this app. It's worth the headache.
4522,Shane in SLC,"May 30, 2011",4,"Readable I don't read many glossy magazines, so I don't find the layout as comforting as a lot of people apparently do. I have complaints, in fact: for example, I wish that when you clicked on an article that it would take you directly to the article itself, rather than to an intermediate page. But when I find myself with time to kill and wanting something to read, I have to admit that I go to Flipboard most often..."
4523,PsychoRev,"August 21, 2011",5,"Simply AMAZING! I will have to echo the comments of others.  This is truly incredible and nearly instantly became my most used app.  I spend considerable time browsing the internet, but nothing can compare to the way Flipboard presents information.  Even Facebook looks better. I never used to read much conventional reading material but can't seem to put Flipboard down.  You simply MUST get this app!"
4524,Dbphoto fla,"November 7, 2011",5,"Great app To be honest, I have not had the app that long...but long enough to tell you it offers diverse, interesting, well written content in a very good (magazine style) format. The app transitions smoothly, refreshes quickly and has useful links that direct you to additional relevant content. So far it has not given me any problems and has quickly become one of my most used apps!"
4525,Brandon2084,"November 17, 2011",1,"Doesn't mark entire page as read after flip like it used to The one reason I use flipboard for my google reader account was because it would mark all the articles of each page of my ""magazine"" as read after I flipped the page. The latest update completely nixed that. It will only mark individual articles you flip between, not whole pages. When you have 300 articles, half of them irrelevant to you, you want to be able to skim and mark as read quickly. This was the only reason I use flipboard over Reeder. So fix it! The app is perfect otherwise."
4526,Truearkael,"December 7, 2011",4,"Update Your Servers Please! For everyone getting the same Internet connection error I'm getting after choosing your categories, there's (probably) nothing wrong with your phone.

Until then it is a fail and is being deleted from my phone."

Every morning I don't go to websites like The Drudge Report, MSN or WSJ anymore. I go to Flipboard because everything is categorized to my liking. I recommend this to anyone that wants to change up their news browsing experience. Using Facebook for this is also way cool..."
4530,Padifern,"June 16, 2016",5,"Love it! This is such an interactive app. I love the ability to save my favorite stories in my own magazines so I can refer to them later.

It's great and I enjoy the different magazines I've created on a variety of topics. Only feedback is that I feel the main ""Top Stories"" news magazine has become too siloed around my political persuasion. I'd like to see all angles of a story from both sides of the polarized media outlets."

I used it for my favorite sites and social networks --it was an all-in-one app. Loved it. I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars because the new format is so scrambled and unorganized, that I'm given a bunch of ""curated"" blogs that I care nothing about. For instance, I added Kayaking to my interests and now all I get is news about the travel website. This needs to be optional."
4543,Ozziator,"March 4, 2015",4,Great App to stay up to date on current events. This app allows for the easy access to news and social events without having to go between individual sites.  Two negatives are the inability to copy and paste directly from each article without having to go to safari and not having some news sites I like. This is the only reason I give it a 4 instead of 5 star review.

I have been meaning to write a review for some time now....this is a very cool app, however, I have noticed here in the last couple of months the app keeps crashing while I'm reading articles...which means...I have to reopen Flipboard and search for the article I was reading.  It is VERY annoying!  Is there a way that you could take a look at your script and find out why it does this. I happens almost everyday now....please fix this!!! Thanks... Terry from Idaho"
4545,Reluctant Lemming,"November 21, 2015",1,"How to Keep Zite users on board I can appreciate that Flipboard is proud of their flip interface. I wouldn't expect them to change to accommodate Zite users, even though they now own it. After all, it's called Flipboard for a reason.  However, why not try to hang on to Zite users?   The flip interface is polarizing. You either love it or hate it. Obviously Zite users aren't fans of this interface. That's why we have refused to switch. "
4546,ipodlvrpgh,"December 22, 2015",5,"Great way to get the news I want Since its first release, Flipboard has been an excellent way for me to get my daily digest of news, the way I want it.  It's fast, easy to use and does a great job culling the kind of information I want to know about.  My only complaint is the overlapping of stories in different topics.  That's minor though and doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the app."
4547,Cracked out on trivia,"December 22, 2015",5,Must have! This is a must have if you care to learn about anything current.

4550,Frustrated iPhone 6 user,"September 28, 2010",5,"Best iPad app Flipboard is by far my favorite iPad app out. Its the one I show off to my friends. Makes reading social media so much more interactive, attractive, etc. I read so much more now than I ever did before. Being able to follow individual Twitter feeds like Engadget and The Onion is awesome plus compiled sources including my own feeds. Just perfect. The recent update put it over the top. I can't believe this app is free."
4551,kuamy,"July 30, 2011",5,"Most addictive app ever! I have many, many apps, but this app has quickly become my new favorite! Impossible to be bored when you have downtime if you have this app. It's amazing how often I email links from Flipboard. Everyone that have recommended it to has found it as addictive, fun, and useful as I have, which I think says a lot. Thanks for making it available!!"
4552,Blizzard Lizard,"August 16, 2011",5,"I have the need...the need for feeds! Think this is just a social and entertainment tool? Think again. Consolidating Google Reader, Google Alerts, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn into one interface has greatly increased my business productivity by freeing up more of my valuable time. This is the most efficient way to be fed information and to feed others. If knowledge is power, this is a nuclear reactor."
4553,Bradster 1,"August 26, 2011",5,I've seen the future of digital entertainment This is such a fantastic and useful application. It's easy to navigate and add favorites.  The format is groundbreaking and gorgeous to look at.  It's like one stop shopping for all your news and entertainment.  I look forward to future updates.. Hopefully with e-books and more video content.  Kudos to all involved in bringing us this revolutionary new format.
4554,Gllo,"December 7, 2011",5,"Apple, please purchase Flipboard! The app has completely changed the way I consume web-based content on the iPad, and now on the iPhone. I didn't think it would be a good experience, but it's perfect. I've not been this excited about an app in a long time. "
4555,Wonderingwhy042,"December 19, 2011",5,Absolutely fantastic Flipboard has quickly become one of my favorite and most used apps. It does a superb job of conglomerating my favorite news sources and has allowed me to stay up to date on everything from world events to the newest science and tech. The layout is top-notch and Flipboard features an excellent repository of objective news sources.
4556,meoww42,"August 1, 2012",5,"💕💗I love this App 💞 Awesome free app that offers customized news feeds, events or timeline articles. Great way to catch up on multi stories in just a few minutes. I don't recall crashing... But what app hasn't crashed at least once? I used on my iPhone 3GS, iPhone4 and iPod (AT&T) without problems. Personally, I totally enjoy this app and don't understand how anyone can complain when something this good is for FREE!"
4557,exaptilc,"November 27, 2012",5,Great App It's so customizable and user friendly that I found myself using it throughout the day without a thought many times a week. I can hardly say that about a few apps on my phone (you know what I'm talking about..) it does all of the work of compiling many news stories yet gets out of the way so that you can digest the information seamlessly. Great job guys!
4558,CentralUnitedCoach,"November 27, 2012",5,"You need it Get it. Put in your info. Its more than just a way to enjoy your personal daily feed. It has the best presentation and organization I've seen, and makes everyone who looks over my shoulder envy what I have. There's no switching between apps or from one browser to another to get caught up on friends and family, news, stories, pics, trends, etc.."
4559,RJ7bb,"June 18, 2014",5,"Great App, but I have a feature request please add the ability to access articles on their original web location with just one tap on the summary when flipping through the items. Right now need to tap to open then tap view original to get the full content on some feeds. Also please add Google News support."
4560,Mancari,"July 29, 2010",1,This company is a joke! After getting am email saying its ready for me to set up my Facebook and twitter (which was about 4 days after originally downloading the app) this is the email I got a couple of hours later. 
4561,mohpa,"December 2, 2014",5,"Terrible update ! Missing Zite feature 👎 It seems the new flipboard app has been terribly managed. It's missing the key Zite feature. While flipboard bought and closed Zite updates last weekend, it's features have not been baked in properly into its curent app. I just hope that the future update will bring the option to revert back to the old layout."
4562,silverzippo,"January 28, 2015",1,"If I could give this app 0 stars I would Hmm where do I start. Flip board looks nice, but doesn't really work well. The stories I receive have nothing to do with my interests no matter which articles I like. Mute doesn't really work. I don't know how many times I've muted huffington post and its even listed in my mute list, but 80% of my articles are from the HP. Articles don't refresh.  I keep seeing the same articles week after week.  I know all the sues I regularly read refresh daily. Zite works so much better. Too bad flipboard has purchased them. I'm expecting to have a bad experience there soon."
4563,Hawkman12s,"January 30, 2015",5,The Right Stuff Love the ability to get news and current info in a contextualized manner. Feels like you are flipping through a magazine. Easy to get back to your previous stream when you want to read all of a specific article. You can receive news and info on very specialized subjects. Ads are not too intrusive. Great stuff!
4564,OkChicken,"June 27, 2015",4,"My Go-to App I fell in love with Flipboard a couple of years ago.  It is my go-to place for general news (which is really handy since I dumped cable), for topics I need to keep up with on the professional side, and up-to-date information on topics of personal interests.  It's always convenient and I can add or drop topics as needed.  It has really been handy to keep articles related to any classes I am taking. It's a great way to access resources."
4565,tlsvzla,"December 4, 2015",5,"FLIPBOARD ROCKS!!! I hardly ever write reviews... But, if and when I do, it's got to be something that impresses me and really excels! This is exactly what flipboard does. Impressed by the graphics, manner of presenting the information, and ease of use. The updates are always improvements and add to the already optimum quality of the platform. All I can say is CONGRATS and you've got a lifetime admirer peoria of flipboard. THANKS for a great product."
4566,Hyjano,"December 15, 2015",2,"Not a fan I am going to echo the comments of many who have already posted.  First, flipboard just shuts off. That is so annoying. Just today it's shut down about 4 times. Secondly, flipboard's choices in what it shows me is not interesting. It's difficult to switch to other subjects. I really don't think the program is made to show you things of interest. Lastly, the same picture was used for fitness, teen fiction and nutrition.  That's more of another annoyance or perhaps this program thinks I'm so shallow to click on a 6 pack abs. I miss zite!!!!!!!!"
4567,amock21,"January 20, 2016",5,Wow!!! This new update is beautiful and more resourceful! I like at the beginning how I was able to go through and pick a huge amount of topics that I like. Then I can go into my own profile and customize my sections on my own page. It's kinda like a folder to save cool articles. Overall this is a must HAVE app!!! Thanks Flipboard for a wonderful app and continuing to make it better!
4568,(JimJr),"February 1, 2016",1,"Annoying Reading news and now suddenly the app crashes and I have to find my way back to what I was reading . Constant full page ads . I can read an article and have the same darn article show up 4-8 more times . Seriously , this app has become useless. "
4569,Eppie3225,"March 1, 2016",5,"Efficient news method I love the option to sort thru whatever topic I'm drawn to at the moment or getting an overall view from the cover story. This filters out items of interest so I don't waste time searching throu extraneous info. If I'm only in the mood for uplifting news, I know which area to flip to and if I want to see late breaking news, I can go there. Love it!"
4570,Matt Morgan Designs,"March 11, 2012",5,"Best way to read my feeds I've tried other readers and Flipboard out does the rest. I like how I can ""like"", comment, and share right from Flipboard to my most common social networks. The feed GUI makes it easy to ""flip"" through recent posts. "
4571,Improviz,"March 12, 2012",4,"A 4 which would be a 5 if... If there was any way to store stories for later reading. They claim to have the ability to do it for third party sites etc., but I'm not a member and don't plan to be. Other apps of this sort have a simple ""save article"" button which allows you to read the story at a later time. This would be a very nice addition to make it hands-down five stars, but till then it's a four out of five"
4572,Bryce12687,"March 12, 2012",5,"Sick app One of my most used apps on my iPhone. I can access my tumblr, check news, and thousands of RSS feeds and websites in a format that's more reader friendly than any website, with enough share options to share anywhere online! "
4573,astromezzo,"March 12, 2012",5,"Easy to love, one of the best apps ever Been using this on an iPhone. Flipping motion is very comfortable and intuitive.  Ability to view my twitter lists,  google reader and FB and a few other streams makes it the app I spend the most time with.  Cover stories feature gives a nice customized overview of things that are most important to you.  Aesthetics make it that much more useful and a pleasure!"
4574,Nahagwshzh,"March 14, 2012",5,Best App to transform how you access info ! No App has changed my use of news and social media more than this one! It truly is transformative! You will actually enjoy viewing your Twitter and Facebook feeds. Ands news and info will be much more enjoyable than any web page or RSS feed before. I find it as addictive as Pinterest but much more useful and productive use of my time.
4575,Sewn4u,"April 3, 2012",5,"My favorite APP I am new at this IPAD thing. Thanks to our son we're learning something new all of the time. I was thrilled to find this app and all that it has to offer. Forget Reruns on TV, there is so much to find on these pages. News, updates on the trail of the political candidates, weather issues, food, travel and so more."
4576,iam_watt,"November 21, 2012",5,"Hands Down, Best App. I've never had a favorite app and until Flipboard when asked what's my favorite app I would jokingly answer “e-mail.” Not sure how I learned about Flipboard but when I did and downloaded it onto my iPhone five I was instantly hooked. And now I have the mini and it's just as dope. Definitely some minor improvements I would make but outside of those this app is perfect. Good job..."
4577,tjenkins777,"November 27, 2012",5,Favorite social media app! By far Flipboard is my favorite social media app. Everytime I'm wanting to see what's been tweeted or posted or instagrammed I open flipboard. The only time I go to the native apps for my social networks is to do the few things that flipboard can't do.
4578,PewterNerd,"May 14, 2013",5,"Hidden Killer Feature The interface and ability to bring together your social media sources in a nice electronic newspaper format are the obvious nice features. What isn't obvious is even better - the ability to post and cross post to all my social media accounts from one app, which happens to be the same app that I like to read all of these sources from is absolutely awesome!"
4579,Jimjrfl,"July 9, 2014",4,"To the point info This is a very cool app that I find myself gravitating to a couple times a day! The information is headlined, quick access, easy to read and follow all the information of your top favorite subjects. If all you want are the facts, they are right there for you to see. If you want more detail just open the full article and read away. A very cool,app that is well thought out and smartly designed."
4580,Inakira7,"December 16, 2010",5,"Flipboard is a pleasure to use Flipboard is fast becoming my go-to news reader. between Pulse and Flipboard, the iPad shines and reading news is simply a pleasure."
4581,Mac an Ghaill,"January 3, 2011",5,"The reason for the iPad I LOVE this app. It is one I use daily. No need to be a Twitter or Facebook user, there is plenty of content within- including the ability to add your own content. I've added some of my favorite blogs. The layout is beautiful and easy to navigate. I urge anyone I know who has an iPad to get this app. It is so good that I would gladly pay for the content if it was not already free."
4582,daisyrunner,"May 26, 2011",5,"Beautiful, functional, and it just works. Not only am I able to keep up with current events, I've also been introduced some really neat websites that I would never have thought to look for. Plus I can add my favorite blogs, which makes this app a one-stop-shop when I want to check the news, catch-up on science and technology news, and read a bit of SCL."
4583,wilyo70,"December 10, 2011",5,"Great app even though it had initial struggles After fixing their server problems, Flipboard has made not only the best news and social networking app for the iPad, but has done it again for the iPhone. Beautiful UI and gives you everything you need to stay in the loop. Cover Stories is a great addition as well. If you don't already have it, what are you waiting for?"
4584,NikeTennis15,"January 22, 2012",3,"Needs to update more Right off the bat it's absolutely stunning; bright colors, great organization, etc. The only problem, and it's been mentioned before, is that it doesn't update NEARLY often enough and there's no option in settings for this. I check my Twitter or Facebook then go back to Flipboard and there's a pretty impressive lag.... like hours. To me, this is borderline useless if the info isnt current. Please fix this and I'll post 5 stars. A complete revolutionary game changer if the lag is fixed."
4585,MrHokie,"October 7, 2016",5,"Great app - Top 5 iPad Visually stunning headlines, fast loading, and great simplicity in its integration with multiple news & social sites.  Intuitive way to read news, social updates, and is at home from the boardroom or the beach.  ""Magazines"" help you archive and simply organize your favs. "
4586,Dangcookie,"November 22, 2016",4,"A must, but one issue... Flipboard has been my source of news for years. Outstanding and trailblazing. My one complaint is that embedded videos often do not appear within the articles in Flipboard. The only workaround is to open the page in Safari to get the videos to appear. Apple's News app does not have this problem, so clearly it is something that Flipboard can, but has yet to resolve."
4587,Querubinq,"January 17, 2017",5,"Not as customizable as it should be I miss zite, which was taken over by flipboard. It updated news faster, you were able to give a thumbs down to news from a particular website so it will not appear in the future, and likewise in an inverted way for news you are interested. Disappointed with flipboard."
4588,Lovetheapp2,"February 12, 2017",1,"Devastated that I ""updated"" the app Wow I wish I had read the reviews of the new version before updating. They absolutely ruined this app. My favorite and only news/ current event source and app is no longer usable. All you get is your cover story page to flip through. They took away the whole thing I used to always go to flip through all the feeds I had saved mostly by site just flipping through until I found interesting things. It's no longer set up like that and thus pretty much useless. Developers.. You really f'ed this one up. Deleting, one of my oldest and most used apps."
4589,jpvann,"February 18, 2017",5,"Very Poor News Aggregator.  Pretty App - No Substance. This app is LAUGHABLE as a 'News' Aggregator or Magazine.  Unheard of website sources, ridiculous websites pushing so called serious news.  Have had to 'mute' (remove) two dozen or more 'news' sites due to blatant bias, silly writing or obviously part of Flipboard only because they advertise."
4590,BDMOD,"August 15, 2013",5,"I use it everyday and love it I love being able to put together my own daily ""news"". It's interesting and relevant to me and hey if I change my mind I change my subscriptions.  Besides the usual content you'd expect there are the  most interesting custom curated collections from people far more talented and well-read than me.  I get lost flipping through their creations. A+"
4591,katepanas,"August 15, 2013",4,"Best way to read period. By far I love this app. It merges everything you could possibly want to read throughout the week into one simple format.  It's the only thing I read now since it pulls from almost every source out there. This app makes my iPad. However I have it on 3 iPads and 2 iPhones and its always a bit crashy, not horribly so but specially with video or larger articles it happens. Well worth app to have however."
4592,Fjxbdjd d,"August 16, 2013",5,"One of the best apps out there Ive downloaded a lot of apps, from dots to appetites. this has got to be in my top ten this app is filled with things to discover, From cars to gossip. plus since you customize your feed you can filter out all the stuff that you dont care about and Facebook, twitter and Instagram and tons of other social media is built right in, its a fantastic app !"
4593,McRosko,"March 15, 2014",5,Great news source I love the format of flipping through the pages instead of having to go back to the main page and click on each story.  This also makes it easier to scan through other topics as well.  I read more topics from around the world that are informative and entertaining.
4594,RoryNC,"March 16, 2014",5,"must-have, entertaining app Love the power this app gives me to create my own magazines with topics that matter to me most as well as to archive my own creative endeavors - i.e. my ""one pic tweet a day"" personal challenge.

4595,Bmeek11,"May 25, 2014",5,Greatest news search engine Choose your favorites and it collects them from hundreds of sites. It does not get any easier.  Then just browse a favorite topic and you will find articles you would never have known about. At times I find the amount of info overwhelming. How's that for a complaint. Use it and you won't be disappointed.
4596,WhoUAre2Become,"November 22, 2014",5,"IChef This is a very seamless news app and I enjoy it a lot. I use it every day. I just wish there was a ""reader"" option once I open a web page with the article on it within this app. I still end up opening the link in reader to dive into the articles. The download in App Store links are working sometimes when I'm reading an article."
4597,Chris 96434674,"May 1, 2015",3,"Getting worse. Every update that promises to fix bugs, comes with weeks worth of random crashes, until they come out with an update to fix the update to get rid of bugs that never existed until they decided to do an update. Also they pick random words in an article in order to create a tag. An article on ""huge black boners"" will be tagged ""black lives matter"" I'm sure that the subject matter is slightly different even if there is slight overlap."
4598,str/etr,"June 17, 2015",5,"Outstanding! This app provides all the information I look for throughout the day. Being able to select topics of choice, I'm informed of all my interests continually. The bad part (if you consider this bad) is there are way TOO many topics this app covers. Rest assured if you're interested in an obscure topic, this will likely get you news/information referencing it."
4599,Innerducky,"January 19, 2016",2,"How I Miss Zite Does Flipboard actually learn anything when I thumb up or down?  It's the same garbage news, regardless of how I rate articles.  I recently liked an article about AI/singularity and every single suggested article in my next go round was ONLY about that topic.  I feel like all I'm getting is a push of down-low ""promoted"" articles.  I've spent the past week or so really trying to like/not like all the articles, yet it's still all garbage.  I truly miss Zite and feel like I am just suffering through this until something better comes along."
4600,Gabby4567,"July 28, 2011",5,Lmt This is the first thing I look at each day and I continue to check it throughout the day. All my favorite interests are gathered in one spot and it is so easy to see the day's main stories immediately.
4601,The Show7749,"August 6, 2011",5,"Favorite App Ever!! I use this app everyday on my way into work instead of buying a physical newspaper. It is 10 times more interesting and useful to me. It always impresses anybody that I show it to. My only suggestion would be to add a feature that could download and save the entire magazine for offline viewing (for flights/subway, etc. where there isn't wifi). Great app!!!!"
4602,BSteggeman,"March 12, 2012",5,"iPad's Killer App When I pick up my iPad, Flipboard is usually the first, and the last application I open. It's how I consume the majority of my news and blogs.

If only they would add off-line caching of feeds and ""full articles"" so I could use it on an airplane, it would be perfect."

I thought I wouldn't need it, or it would be boring, but then I thought, ""Well, there has to be SOMETHING to it for it to get such high marks."" How right I was.

4606,Lazlo,"July 17, 2012",1,"Feed order settings need to be added The fact that the developers think that reading items out of order is the correct and *only* way of doing things goes to show the real issue with this software. It is a great app and I like the way it looks but it needs to follow people's ways of looking at data.  Some people like the way they implemented it.  Some people, however, don't and that is a major point of contention.  I've had to move on to other apps that will present the data the way I need but are less ""visually impressive"". Please correct this oversight with your app."

I am goin to download Zite though, I just read a review recommending it on here and I'm going to give it a look.  I've had no trouble from my Flipboard App though."

4609,Matt41986,"July 12, 2013",4,"Perfect but... First off, the app is a must have! It's perfect for getting caught up in small pieces throughout the day. The only issue I am having is on my iPhone 5 iOS 6.1, I cannot share to Facebook. Regardless of what network (LTE or Wi-Fi) I am on. I have tried uninstall and reinstall numerous times as well as wiping the phone and starting again. If this functionality worked, this app would be a 5 star - no doubt. All in all, great job!!!!!"

It's a great design that appeals to me and makes me want to keep up with the news, which I do regularly thanks to this app (I use to read NY times online, but you have to pay for that now so it's a bust for us poor folks). Freaking awesome app!!"
4622,Mgeexoo,"November 27, 2012",5,"Entertaining If you ever find yourself in an awkward situation and you just got to whip out your phone, turn to this app! You will seriously get carried away with all the different categories to look at, it's really entertaining it almost feels as though you're reading a magazine due to the quick flick you got to do to change the page. 5/5 stars great app!"
4623,Powersponge,"April 11, 2013",5,Was great until latest update! Ever since the latest Flipboard update one needs to kill the process and reload the application in order for articles to download new content. Please fix!
4624,AmyJKR,"January 4, 2014",5,"Beautiful, Informative, Entertaining I love this app. You can tailor it to your preferences for news, DIY projects, art, science, and pretty much anything you can imagine. "
4625,iClet,"April 20, 2014",5,"Great, but one suggestion If you have too many panels, the last one requires you to click, which takes you back to your clipboards and you must then scroll down to click on final ones. Either make all available on front page, or allow it to go directly to your full listing as the initial screen."
4626,Joeleo1937,"November 4, 2014",2,"Pout dated reporting I think Flipboard is one of the top news apps around. It's coverage is superb, grabbing news from all over the world."
4627,Pateln@wit,"December 30, 2014",2,The old version was better I have given this new version a chance since they switched the layout... It's an ok layout and I'm not upset that they changed it although it's not very fitting of the name anymore (flipboard). What really gets me mad is the fact that when I click on articles it sometimes takes me to some random article that has nothing to do with what I clicked... I have to go back and then click on the same article again. This happens randomly but frequently and is very annoying.
4628,RichmondJdub,"April 3, 2015",5,"Perfect single stop to stay current For most people in today's working world, there is narrow separation between work life and personal life.  Flipboard embraces this concept and aggregates articles from the topics you select.  I use it in a work hard/play hard manner.  Reading a couple of articles on management and leadership, then catching up on the latest cars."
4629,Lost in GA,"December 10, 2015",3,"Okay but not as good as Zite Really disappointed, I thought this would be just a UI change from Zite but I can see the content being served up is drastically different.  It can't seem to consistently provide things that I am really interested in reading.   It feels like certain subjects are weighted more than others (and I just started using it) so it keeps giving me lots of extra articles about one subject instead of a good balance of everything.   I miss my Zite..."
4630,Vernin44,"June 30, 2011",5,New favorite app I love almost everything about this app.
4631,Thesauraus-Wrecks,"August 20, 2011",5,"Great Reading and Social Networking I love being able to flip between my favorite news sources, tweets (which were getting annoying until I used Flipboard and it's unique format) and other social media all in one place. The way links show as a brief description, photos populating that I would have otherwise missed - it's freaking cool. Just download and enjoy."
4632,Kdaledesign,"November 22, 2011",5,"A must have This is an excellent app for people who follow news and information from multiple sources. Integrates great with google reader, twitter, Facebook and provides it in a way that allows you to quickly flip from page to page just as if reading a magazine. This is quickly become my sole source for interfacing with these different services."
4633,LadyEuphoria,"January 22, 2012",4,Great App I love this app! It has everything all in one place and makes Facebook a more productive place for discovering news and reading articles shared by friends. 
4634,kurtfm,"February 13, 2012",4,The news app to beat This app is so clean and enjoyable to use. Gives you that kind of polished professional magazine publishing kind of feel.
4635,threedeuce5,"March 11, 2012",4,"Add two features, then perfection! The only thing keeping this from being a perfect app is the fact that you can't see Facebook notifications from the tile screen, nor will it auto-fill you twitter followers when composing a tweet. If these two features were added this would probably be the only app needed on the iPad. Beautifully designed and executed. I love looking through this every day. Well done!"
4636,adiMU7,"March 12, 2012",5,"the best reading app ever! before I download Flipboard, I rarely read news through my iPod Touch because I think my iPod's screen is too small. But since I use Flipboard, I find that it's very convenient to read news, and I use Flipboard to read news more often. But the only disadvantages of the app is it's loading speed seems to be slow sometimes."
4637,Bvelji,"March 12, 2012",4,"Good but could be better I like it so far and have been using it almost every day. I wish it were a little easier to get to the stories you mark from a desktop/laptop, but maybe I should be using the read it later program connections. The only other negative is searching. I can't seem to search for the headline to retrieve an article, just users and topics. Other than that it's great."
4638,Lycheeice,"March 22, 2012",5,You should get this app This app is beautifully designed.  Interface is easy to follow.  I actually check this first before looking at other site to get my news.  This one is optimized for iPhone and it's just as beautiful as the version for iPad although slightly different.  Since it is free you should just download this app and use it!
4639,Culthero72,"April 17, 2012",5,"You'll ""Flip"" for Flipboard I had no real idea what this app was at first, but it looked interesting, and it was free. Once I set it up, I was really surprised by how cool it was. Great way to read all of your social feeds. Just like flipping through a great magazine with a fun layout. All of the pictures and Twitter feeds look great too. I can only imagine how much more fun this app will be as it gets updates. Good job Flipboard"
