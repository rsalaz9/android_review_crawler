0,RedXIII_,"June 14, 2018",5,"A joy to use Kayak has been a fantastic company to use for anything travel! & has continued to impress me with their fun and very easy to use features. Airline companies often set standard pricing for their flights and the caveat that the normal person is looking for it matching all these flights with their specific needs i.e. layover timeline, # of bags, airline make/model, & flight times. A ‘Good Deal’ is a very generalized term and many other apps use that as their main means of persuasion when in fact it’s clear that sites like Kayak are so good at categorizing exactly what meets your needs and alining airliners to your schedule, like advertised they have a multitude of tools like bag number and layover timeline settings with a accurate representation of what the cost will be regardless if it is two separate companies. If you choose a flight selection that has a 2 hour layover for one airliner and you select ‘book’ the airliners website which it directs you to within the app has that selection already selected. I could go on and on about how easy and secure this app is to use so please give it a try."
1,A1y2a3n4a5,"March 17, 2018",4,"Great Site I've been using Kayak to book my flights for about 2 years now. I like them. Only thing that would make it better was if you could filter what types of flights you wanted for alert emails. I have two kids I'm flighting with this time and even though my last two flights basic economy was a great option because I'm not particular about where I sit, this time around I need to ensure my boys are beside me. I get really excited to see a price in a email just to see it's basic economy and the regular economy tickets are like $40 more. $40 difference is a lot when you need 3 of them. Another great improvement would be being able to mix and match the flight there and the flight back. Since we're going to New York to visit my fiancé I want a really early flight to get there and a late afternoon to come back. Sometimes they add up like that but usually they don't. I could book them separate but it would be a lot easier if they could just be chosen like that. Those are my only complaints. Still like and will use the site."
2,H3110 101,"March 4, 2019",5,"I love this app I got this app for one plane flight, simple as that. I was planning on deleting it right after because I thought I had no use for it. But then I started to realize that any trips I was planning on taking would show up on this app and would be organized by time and date (because I connected my email)."
3,Maddie1975,"June 11, 2018",4,"Great except for one thing The app is amazing. It is beautifully designed and works amazing. I only have one problem with it. It won’t let you search for a “youth’s” flight with no adult. Anyone above 12 is allowed to fly by themselves.  They have a “youth” listed as a person between 12-17, whereas a “child” is 2-11. It would seem that they have this separated for the purpose of allowing someone to look at prices for just a youth; However, even when the youth ticket is added, when you try and delete the adult ticket selected on default, it will tell you that there must be one adult traveling. This makes it harder for me because different airlines charge different fees for unaccompanied minors, especially the ones that charge for the unaccompanied minor service no matter their age. As I am trying to book a flight for 2 teenagers, this is necessary for me. Disregarding that, the app is the most user friendly and easy to use booking apps I’ve seen."
4,NOK1033,"April 23, 2018",1,"Beware of “trips” portion of App I have used kayak for a long time but recently had a very terrible experience and will not be booking flights through kayak anymore. Beware of the “trips” portion of the app. I bought a flight through kayak and it was added to my trips. There were changes to my flight, but my trips still reflected the original times, even though I used kayak to purchase my flights. Long story short I ended up missing my flight and paying lots of money in change fees. It’s odd to me that the company automatically lists the flight you purchased through their company under “trips” but do not update the flight information if an airline changes flight times. Even when I missed my actual flight my app still said “4 hours 27 minutes until take off”. Super unfortunate end to a trip, but learned my lesson to never book with kayak again. Also, when trying to sort and talk through this issue, I was unable to speak with anyone from kayak. The closest contact to a human you can get is through an email."
5,Colonel Brian M,"November 24, 2018",5,"Love KAYAK As a retired military officer I’m entitled to “Space Available” flights on military aircraft. For the past five years I’ve taken advantage of this to fly from Travis AFB in California, through Yokota AFB in Japan to my final destination in Singapore.  That’s when I start using KAYAK to investigate and book flights throughout South East Asia.  Using KAYAK I’ve been able to comfortably book flights to Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and the Philippines.   I also use KAYAK to get me to and from Orlando to Sacramento to start and finish the free portion of my travel from California.  I’ve tried other travel sites and always return to KAYAK.  I particularly like the feature allowing me to check the day before and after a travel date to get the cheapest flight.  I don’t know how we’ll KAYAK works in other parts of the world, but where I travel it’s clearly the best."
6,Kwalter11,"February 4, 2019",5,Update! This is such a good app so much better than Trip It or any of the other travel apps. But I really wish there was a way to automatically add the same passengers to different flights. So you don't have to add the same info for the same passenger over and over again. Also I wish that after you have put in a passenger/travellers info including their ticket number and seat number it would load mobile boarding passes onto the app for that flight. Or you could import mobile boarding passes. Keep up the good work Kayak. If you add these suggestions it will be 6 stars.
7,H2018A,"September 23, 2018",4,"Not always updated or working It seems your recommendation for price change is not always appearing. Sometimes it recommends to wait as the prices will drop and sometimes does not show up at all. Then you want to follow it, but even the next day it does not tell anything, it makes it confusing to decide on waiting or buying the ticket at that time or still continue waiting as was suggested a day before. You buy the ticket due to uncertainty of the idea that in fact prices are still going up in those two days then after a week it starts showing up to wait again as the prices will drop. This is not costumer friendly. It is valuable to have such option for following, but if not consistent it becomes tricky."
8,Ericwood86,"March 11, 2020",3,"Website is great. App not so much. We’re planning a wedding. The app, despite specifying dates without the option of plus/minus one day, it’s just factored in without making it clear that they have done that.  You have to be smart enough to check dates, for day scouting out a destination wedding venue. Which sounds stupid since dates are obvious. But you give us a cocktease of flights extremely by one day off from correct travel plans and it’s not until we double check that we are disappointed. Appreciate all that you do, but you need to do better. On your website it’s quite clear if you’re adding a day either direction. On your app you just do it and don’t let us know. You have to assume we are stupid and won’t double check until the point we book. Bc that’s what most of us are. Stupid."
9,eddie laso,"March 29, 2019",5,Worst experience ever spend over a thousand because of this company I normally use them for any vacation I go on but I missed my flight on Saturday in lax going to Charlotte NC and when I got to the airport they said only see one ticket from Washington to Charlotte and could not see any other tickets so we had to purchase new tickets on top of this from some where else but kayak charged my bank account and reaching them was impossible because it was an computer speaking for them I left my number and still have not received a call back from them if it was not for my bank I would not have receive a refund so if you do not care to speak to actual customer service reps then use it
10,2man73,"October 31, 2017",3,"Ok for searching flights Using this to compare flights. Works ok if you know how to work around the issues. Airlines are smartening up and for example offer very reasonable prices until you discover that your first checked bag, your hand luggage, your meal and who knows what else all cost extra, so to really compare apples to apples gets harder and harder. "
11,SriniVR,"October 31, 2017",5,"Great app, can improve Kayak is a great app, and I really like the explore feature.  I have found great deals using this feature.  With the explore feature you can set the filters to narrow down by month and $ amounts.  "
12,YuTube2U,"January 26, 2018",5,"Kayak’s trip info is excellent I LOVE this app. Yeah, it does a great job finding flights, cars and hotels but it’s real gem, the thing that makes this The Travel App is how it helps organize your trip. Everything neatly organized, in order. You can simply send your booking receipts to an email address and it organizes everything for you in one neat place. You can even pull up the booking receipt in the app, even if not generated by Kayak. There’s a cool way to show your taxi driver the address in a way that she doesn’t need to use reading glasses. One click and it’ll give you directions on your choice of Waze, google maps or Apple maps. This app Gets it Right. Way to go guys!!"
13,.jay,"October 31, 2018",2,"Works but it’s a little sketchy So I realized after buying tickets through Kayak that Kayak is basically a curator for a bunch of possibly sketchy online travel agencies. Some data doesn’t get transferred over properly, your “My Trips” tab doesn’t always reflect what’s actually going on with your trip, and they completely absolve themselves from all responsibly once you buy tickets from whoever they linked you to. It’s not immediately clear who you’re dealing with unless you’re looking for it, because everything is still wrapped in Kayak’s branding and chrome. "
14,Kmass81,"February 22, 2019",5,"Why Kayak is the greatest must have travel app Today on southwest at 4am my flight was cancelled. No email from southwest, no call, no text. Without kayak I wouldn’t have known about this cancellation until arriving at the airport. Upon immediate notification of the cancellation kayak emailed me saying your flight has been cancelled this is your confirmation number here is southwests number to contact them etc etc. i never take the time to write reviews but this is by far the most pivotal program that kayak can have. Alerts before the actual companies you pay alert you."
15,andychinn,"May 7, 2019",1,"worst customer service ever I booked a hotel through Kayak and when I got to the hotel, they didn’t have my reservation. Kayak told me to book the room as a walk in and then the rate will be replaced in the morning with a call to Kayak. "
16,HerFuzziness,"May 25, 2019",1,"Kayak + Skyscanner: Bait and switching now... Posted the same bad review for Skyscanner too: A few years ago, I stopped using Momondo because it would advertise flights for one price, THEN raise the price AFTER you input your credit card information. Kayak (and Skyscanner) isn't that bad, but for the last month, every time I've checked a price for the EXACT same flight for the EXACT same date, it advertises the same ""bait"" price, then after clicking on the adjacent link, the price doubles, then triples. Not sure why you'd advertise a one-way flight for $254 FOR A MONTH, but then increase it to $720. Shouldn't you stop the BS bait price on the umpteenth search? Should I blame the cookies? And you must realize that customers can actually search a plane's seat availability, so the claim that the seats are limited is tired, not just dishonest. So, way to go, Kayak. You're just as useless as Momondo and Skyscanner now."
17,Clean app,"November 5, 2019",5,UPDATE: Bring back watchlist UPDATE: so for some reason they buried the watchlist feature in settings. Not a great move. But it’s still around. Still a great app overall.
18,Plinkos,"March 17, 2020",5,"Cancelon Travel Bookings via TripAdvisor Not Good Cancelon by TripAdvisor is a fraudulent service and should be removed from Kayak Service offerings.   Please, please, please remove them. They give customers the run around and keep their money.  We are in the mist of the COVID-19 virus outbreak and our trip to Italy is not possible and they are making it super difficult to get our money back.  We even have emails from the hotel in Italy stating they would cancel and not charge anything to the booking company “Cancelon” which contradicts what they emailed us stating the the hotel refused.  So, Kayak, please shut TripAdvisor and Cancelon off from your service offerings. "
19,Pakitt,"January 22, 2020",3,"Could do a lot more and a good feature does not work. I use Kayak very often to track prices and find the best connections. The “See cheapest dates” function doesn’t work though. If a price is listed for a specific set of days, when you click on it the resulting search is markedly more expensive. "
20,Herbicles,"October 1, 2017",5,"I love using kayak I am an avid traveler of the globe. I only use kayak for plane tix, but I love the way it is set up and the idea behind it to begin with. I especially like the forecasted wait or buy label they added at the top. The only thing I wish they would add is the ability to enter a specific date range without a destination. There is a whole subculture of peeps who just want to travel on a budget, regardless of where. LonelyPlanet+ Hostelworld make their living off this type of traveler."
21,JY237,"November 20, 2017",2,"BEWARE! Up to this point, I have book many of hotels and flights with no issue. kayak has been my go to app for booking trips. BEWARE of a Kayak partner Vayama. When  making flight, Kayak forwards you to a partner travel site for booking. On Kayak, flights are advertised as one level, ie economy class, which includes check-in luggage, but after purchased the ticket are downgraded to lesser class with no check-in luggage. Before booking, I went to airlines site to verify what was included in the economy class. I called the partner and the agents yelled at me.  FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! I would recommend for all to check better business bureau. I wish had checked before wasting my money with them."
22,Ategworld,"November 24, 2017",5,"Inconsistent and wrong information on flight prices Lately I have tried to book flights on Kayak only to find out the prices quotes provided were much higher when I was about to finalize my purchases.  This happened multiple times and cost me a lot of work and last minute changes to purchase tickets from other sites/travel agents.   If I can’t trust the price quotes provided, the. What good is this app for.  Sorry for the bad review but this is my recent experience."
23,DragonBlue,"February 23, 2018",2,"Terrible user interface Kayak app used to have much better user interface, this version is just terrible!"
24,PerfectTimingNV,"May 25, 2018",2,"Missing Obvious Flights for No Apparent Reason This is unacceptable: it’s completely missing certain flights. For example, checked for nonstop flights from PDX to LAS on May 27th -it completely omitted three flights from Alaska Airlines. But, it showed one Alaskan flight that involved a transfer. And no, the directs were not sold out, not even close. I tripled-checked that there weren’t any parameter issues. I’ve suspected this in the past while searching for flights, but didn’t have this confirmation. "
25,debdebtig,"June 7, 2018",5,"And I thought it was just for booking flights!?! Recently went on a cross country trip and found that Kayak was more helpful than even the airline app. It tells you how long you can expect to take through security. And more importantly, how long it will take to get to the next get when you change flights. It has been spot on! You can also checkin from Kayak. The reminders have been a huge help. They almost seem to get flight updates BEFORE the airline app!"
26,doxzero,"August 10, 2018",4,"Please improve the watchlist It’s a great app I use a lot, but it would be nice to have additional parameters in the watch list like a range of trip duration. A lot of times the chap flights being suggested are just not long enough and I would prefer to be able to just set the parameter to however many days max/min range I’m interested in to filter out the noise. Maybe that’s the answer, just allow day range as a filter option."
27,JR1992x,"June 22, 2019",1,"Horrible first experience I decided to rent through kayak and reserved a car for 4pm and paid the booking fee ($18). I arrive to the location only to find they were closed. Why would you allow me to rent a car and take my money if the location is closed? The employee inside comes out and tells me to use the airport location. Fine. I rebook another vehicle for the airport location and pay the booking fee again. They gladly accepted my money online but when I arrive to the airport I’m told I can only use a credit card. (I use debit) I’m not entirely familiar with renting vehicles, but it’s completely BS that you guys would allow me to book under these circumstances. I’m in the process of getting my money back but I can for sure say I won’t use this again."
28,chjihfddfgh,"December 28, 2019",1,"Terriable when you want to change flight schedule Wanted to change flight schedule. First the agent told the change is done, and they charged my card for the change fee. But never receive any confirmation. After I called back a few days, they told me the booking is not successful, I asked why there’s no notification for that, they told me they don’t send any notification, I should call back to find out. What?!"
29,Torrance Carroll,"January 19, 2020",5,"The best travel mobile app I’ve ever used I’ve been using Kayak for multi-flight and hotel search, Kayak explore,  Kayak Trips and stats for the last 4 years."
30,CritterGuardian,"November 14, 2017",5,"Easy and informative Kayak has been my default travel biking source for years. I use it for flights and hotels but have not yet used it to book a car. Easy to use, competitive pricing in search results. I like the notifications for flight delays. When my flights have been delayed Kayak had the update but the airlines app did not update to reflect the delays. Useful, helpful, and recommended."
31,atr747,"July 25, 2018",5,"Not just for flights Great app, I use it all the time not only for myself but also to help others. The feature that I use the most is the trip planner, is so easy to use and the notifications about gates, and delays are super handy. I get notified by the app before the airline reports the delay. Having all the info about my trip at the tip of my fingers has been a life saver in many occasions. "
32,User 74,"September 10, 2018",5,"Gets the job done... must of the time. The app gets it right... must of the time. However, there are some bugs and “fine prints” in this app that can make your travel interesting experience a bit more complicated than you wish. Maybe the app should have embedded warnings letting you know about possible situations you may encounter due to how fluid airline rules and regulations are. Also, based on the region you traveling, suggestions and warnings."
33,alejandra1814,"October 17, 2018",5,"Best of the best This app is my one and only go to app for travel. I love the feature that syncs your email reservations with the app because it will display your whole trip in a very organized manner, even if you book something outside of kayak. Although, I recommend using Kayak for bookings, they always have lowest prices. I just love this app so much. For someone that likes to keep things organized, and all in one place, this is the app for you."
34,Martha Twain,"November 26, 2018",5,"My go to I use a lot of discount sites and kayak usually has their price meet or beat. Can be a bit frustrating using the watch list feature as it often isn’t accurate when you actually try to book-still a big time and money saver. I recommend it often to friends, acquaintances, and coworkers. Experiences last and things don’t, everyone should travel more."
35,ammusic27,"February 5, 2019",3,"Love Kayak but the app is buggy lately I’ve been a Kayak user for several years now and have always had a good experience. As of late, however, the app has been extremely buggy for me. It takes FOREVER to load flight options and sometimes it freezes up. Perhaps this is just an issue with my phone, but hopefully if others report the same thing they will look into it. Will still continue to use Kayak, but probably via browser instead of app."
36,Awesome music streaming app,"February 7, 2019",5,Great App This app is awesome.  I prefer the interface and filters to all of the other sites and the fact that they also search the other sites to find the best deal is brilliant.  However I'm pretty sure that they used to have a feature that allowed me to search for flights a few days back and a few days forward from a specified date and now I can't find that feature.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
37,khad,"June 9, 2019",1,Stop asking me to turn on notifications I already declined your prompt to turn on notifications. I don’t want notifications. Repeatedly asking every time I open the app is annoying and comes across as desperate. Just stop.
38,TessieTrueblue,"August 20, 2019",5,"More Than Other Apps I have used every travel app out there and this one is my favorite. It eliminates the need to check the others because it does that for you, in addition to researching special rates the hotel has. That’s how I found a great price for the hotel I’m staying in right now. Clean and classic accommodations for a bargain.  That’s what I use travel apps for and what Kyack delivers. I will keep on depending on it. 5 stars."
39,Madkitteh,"December 22, 2019",5,Exactly what I wanted This is the best app known to mankind. 
40,Chidder Chat,"September 19, 2017",5,I wanted to take a canoe but went with Kayak I never travel anymore without using or at least checking out Kayak. Kayak makes it so easy to compare prices and get an idea of what I should or will be paying for my trip. Definitely have made some great memories over the past couple years that wouldn't have happened without Kayak.
41,IUSeymore,"October 3, 2017",4,"Latest updates ruined it Everything was working fine until the last couple of updates. Now, when I go to save a search on my Watch List, it changes the dates and drops all the flights (which then makes notifications pointless). Seems like a nasty bug. Use something else more reliable until this app is fixed."
42,Anonymous. Fjdfjshdiw,"January 5, 2018",5,"Simply the best travel booking app So easy to use with by far the best interface, and I especially love the explore feature. You always get the lowest prices. It also has awesome filtering tools so you are able to narrow down choices that exactly fit your needs. Overall a beautifully designed app, I love Kayak and won’t use any other."
43,Disappointed Twin Momma,"January 7, 2018",2,"Issue with airfare prices I’ve been using Kayak for YEARS and I’ve never faced a problem till now. We fly to Hawaii annually and I usually book my flights through kayak. What I am noticing is that when looking up flights it will say one price and then once it redirects to the site that is offering the flights, the price goes up $100+ this has never happened to me before while using this app and I don’t know if it’s a glitch, but it’s very misleading and I will go elsewhere to book my flights. I’m disappointed."
44,rockinra,"April 12, 2018",1,"Tired of Kayak falsifying prices I think this has to be mentioned. I am not one to leave bad reviews but this has gotten ridiculous. I have gotten emails from Kayak about hotel deals and while searching, Kayak shows me deals and EVERY time I’ve gone to book it says “Sorry, that deal is already sold” and then it gives me a ridiculously high price. This is such a waste of time! I’ve had to switch to a different app. Maybe it’s because of the city I’m trying to book in, New York? But it sure has been very poor this time unfortunately and I have to say something about it because it just in not right."
45,KFM1959,"November 1, 2018",1,Price changes from 1st page to booking page Be careful when using it to book flights. I tried booking two different flights. In both cases the price shown on the first page of flight choices more than doubled when I clicked to book it. It happened with a Frontier flight ($114 became $256) and an American flight ($140 became $278). The price difference was before bag fees. I also confirmed that the fees and taxes were included in the initial fare quote. 
46,Diffi Cult,"December 25, 2018",5,Kayak is so reliable I have used Kayak for years and it beats all the others hands down.  Always great fares and hacker fares too.  Never had a problem with tickets.  If you can be open minded about dates and places that’s the best. Makes travel so easy and guilt free with these prices.  Just have to read what is included in the fare and know what you want!  Difficult
47,jerumaria,"March 9, 2019",5,"Tracking flights minute by minute Love this app! Excellent for buying tickets and also for tracking flights already in effect. I love the fact that’s all in the same app. Clean User Interface, clean maps. When family comes over from overseas, I can check if their flights are on time or delayed easily."
48,Sisi Susu,"April 24, 2019",1,Awful I tried this. Went to log on. “Error you need a stronger password.” I do a new password. Then “Error. You need a confirmation from your email.” I go to email to confirm. I go back to log on. “Error you never chose a password.” I try the forgot password. “Error there’s no account with this email.” I’m done. Anything that takes this long to use an app has already failed. I can use Skyscanner and Fareness without having to register and so forth. The app market is competitive and time is precious. What doesn’t work easily is not worth it for this type of service.
49,Marsanyi,"October 13, 2019",5,"Trip planning features are great I found traveling for a month that the app surfaces just the info I needed right when i needed it; at the train station, at check in time for flights, when I’m in the right neighborhood for the hotel I booked, ...  really nice to have all that info stored in one logical timeline, too, and auto-update from email I forward.  Nice job."
50,|| KP ||,"October 24, 2017",5,"Great app. Frequent user One improvement I always wished for is that I can save the filters. With every search, I need to set the filter again for my flights. I wish there is a way to lock and save my filters. Other than that, it’s a great app for searching the best available flight for the money. 5 stars!!!"
51,Y2K',"May 11, 2018",3,"Used to be great... What happened.... I use the explore part of the app to get most of my flights. The newest update has made it where you can't select out of the country, and the even with in the states it won't work. I would give it a one star but I have used this app with handful of times with great success, I wish you guys wouldn't have ruined it. Make this App Great again"
52,Daisy*05,"July 10, 2018",5,Booking at my fingertips. As I have been traveling often to facilitate my parents moving closer to home. I am finding I need hotels more and more. I love the ease of the app and booking on the go. Constantly comparing prices and location and functionality of each location to my needs at that time. Thanks kayak ! Well done!
53,maysagg,"August 10, 2018",3,Explore I liked the app because I was able to do explore and look at tickets all over the world around my desired  travel time. It must have just changed and I don’t really like it. I’ve been able to get crazy good tickets from the US to Europe and Asia because of the explore feature. I love to travel and when I see a good deal I never hesitate to buy the ticket right then and there. Really hope that they bring it back to the app!
54,bwvla,"September 15, 2018",2,"Hotels difficult to find on kayak Many hotel search result were not actually available and hopelessly outdated.  Upon clicking properties message returned, this deal is no longer available...  one hour later searched again, same results came back and items upon clicking were still not available.   If the site knew they were not available when i clicked an hour earlier why are they still a search result?  Very frustrating"
55,Sandrita_8506,"March 8, 2020",1,"About rentals cars So when it comes to flights Kayak has been amazing, and so i decided to look up for deals in car rentals. Out of all the companies Kayak had the best deal. We were coming back from Okinawa Japan and needed to go cross country because of our dog  (to big to fly with comercial airlines). When the car was reserve the price quoted was $1,118 dollars for 9 days. Well oh my God what I surprise we got when we arrived at Hertz. It went from $1,118 to $1,648. There were a lot of hidden fees and we were very disappointed. For sure will not use kayak for this purpose again."
56,Stevebonk,"September 10, 2019",2,"No deals here/filters fail Helpful as a list of the available 2 or 3 airlines that hold a monopoly on airline routes and bait and switch with hidden fees, but that’s it. "
57,IDCJustLetMePostThisReview,"January 31, 2020",5,"The app seems to work well! I don’t get to travel as much as I like so I don’t use this app everyday, but when I do it’s very easy to navigate and setup alerts for price changes. For the most part the interface is pretty straight forward. I prefer this app over the other flight apps I’ve used in the past."
58,srd606284,"July 4, 2019",1,"Almost unusable now I first got this app over a year ago. It was very helpful and easy to navigate.  Now it is almost unusable for me.  Choosing a deal opens a small window with minuscule print.   Often, the price advertised *(particularly by Agoda) is not the price that shows up just before you purchase.  Also, when selecting a deal, it opens yet another window that wants you to find another button to book the deal, etc. etc.  I find it confusing, extremely hard to read, and unreliable.  I have deleted it from my iPad."
59,con896,"February 24, 2020",5,"You won’t believe this! Literally the smoothest process and very simple to use all while finding best prices humanly POSSIBLE. BELIEVE me, I’ve tried them all. Well worth the download. (Put your alerts on) and watch kayak do its magic ⭐️😉✈️🏝☀️Thank you Kayak for finding me and my twin toddler boys the lowest- fastest- price- possible for our upcoming flight to our yearly vacay."
60,Nomad_76,"September 17, 2017",4,"Overall very good I have been using this app for years for most of my travel plans. Only wish there was an option to set default filters ... for instance, I usually only search my alliance when looking for flights and it's a little cumbersome to apply new filters every time. However, still a great app for travel!"
61,jmpomaha,"September 27, 2017",2,"App for iPad is not usable for cars/change dates. I have been using the Kayak website for years. Now, using iPad app, it is unusable for renting a car. Already have flights and needed a car for PHX in October. The app picks a random date and length of use. There was no way to change the pick up date AND the drop off date. Even tried using the website on the iPad, same issue. Will attempt to do this on a PC. Wondering what will happen for airline flights."
62,KatieM1234,"March 8, 2018",5,"Quick & easy with great prices Title says it all.  It compares many airlines, hotels, and car rental companies in one place for quick cheap travel bookings.  Southwest isn’t on kayak however, so be sure to check that separately.  I use this app all the time... even to just curiously check the cost of flights sometimes."
63,shaunposey78,"March 19, 2018",5,"No better planning app for travel!!! I always use Kayak to plan all my traveling. The filters for flights allow me to quickly find the perfect flight to meet my needs.  Plus, it’s super-easy to share travel info with my friends and family.  There’s simply no better app to use!!"
64,LIZAOSTANINA,"February 7, 2019",5,"Love this app !! My go to app at least twice a day to check the flights prices, compare, play with dates. Easy to utilize, 99% of the time the cheapest pricing in the whole entire web. Sends notifications before, during and after flights so you don’t get messed up on the road."
65,Fuzznatic,"June 7, 2019",1,"Kayak doesn’t review companies - so Fraud is possible Anyone can get on kayak and offer services. (ie car rental) When you search you often book through other companies.  They could be fraudulent.  Kayak later won’t help because it wasn’t booked through them.  This makes it an app susceptible to fraud.  Kayak provides a large audience to fraudulent companies, but not enough controls to protect the consumer. Kayak should improve review of companies on the app, provide a review system, or take other steps to prevent fraud.  Lost $150 bucks on a car rental in Dallas."
66,FriscoNative,"June 26, 2019",5,"Fantastic and flexible Love this app for airline tickets.  Many options presented, and the best part is the ability to sort search results by several variables.  You can choose the amount of time for a layover, or remove certain airports from the list."
67,ABFRE,"June 24, 2019",1,Basic Economy Default should filter out basic economy flights that are over 2hrs duration as I suspect few customer are looking to travel without so much as a carry-on. This is strictly a gimmick of the airlines to further economize the air travel experience and take advantage of sites like Kayal showing the lowest (unrealistic) price. 
68,Drashish123456,"February 4, 2020",4,Historical prices Hard to tell if your getting a deal if we don’t know historical prices so would love to see how the current price compares to same time last couple years and offer flexible dates by % reductions in price.    Plus layover information should be easier to see with less Clicks.  But overall very useful and is my go to airline app
69,TravelMan135,"February 19, 2020",5,First Trip I took my first trip out of the country to Spain and Kayak made the trip so much easier. The way that the app is organized makes it really easy to use and not only that but they had the best prices as well. Would most definitely recommend for frequent travelers
70,DoxtypAKA,"October 28, 2017",3,Overall great but flight tracking is terrible Very convenient for looking up flights and booking. Interface is clean and just works. 
71,BQ33,"October 30, 2017",5,"Won't show original e-mail receipt Generally love this app. But recent versions block you from viewing your original email travel receipt (despite supposed option to do so) unless you are an ""authorized user.""  I am the ONLY user, & logged in. Not clear how I ""authorize"" myself."
72,Tac196,"December 24, 2017",3,Each update forces me to delete the app This problem needs to be fixed because each time I update this app it make searching flights saying error it’s so annoying and I have to delete the app and reinstall it and it’s works again please fix this please. And you remove most in flight amenities feature for this app to so please bring them back.
73,nipponfraser,"February 6, 2018",5,Only downloaded it 5 minutes ago...Absolutely Love it This is the best travel app I’ve ever seen! Absolutely amazing how it organizes your trips from your email address and the reservation you send to that address. Makes planning trips easier than any other application. Love it!
74,playabilityjackson,"June 7, 2018",5,"glitching during search results scroll the app glitches during long search result scroll. user cannot even select other tab. I believe something happens in the main thread, because I’m on iPhone X (which is latest by the time of posting this review)."

I have gone thru the entire process, from initial search to final payment only to find out hours or, in the most recent case, a day later that the flight was not actually booked and I was only assigned a record locator. This is becoming a significant waste of time for me. Please contact me to help resolve the issue."
76,Order upppp fan,"September 24, 2018",5,Great app! I love the indicator to buy or wait! Plus the app searches airlines that some of the other flight search apps don’t include in their searches. They also mix match different airlines for the cheapest price. Another thing not many search apps do. I generally find the cheapest flights on here!
77,Franklinfraden,"February 21, 2019",1,"No professionalism. No customer service at all. I called customer service number because my booking has been cancelled and when I called asking why they said my card has been declined  I try to explain that I called my bank and they said there’s no reason why the card should be declined and asked me to call them back which I did but they don’t let me explain myself, (kayak) they said there’s no supervisor in charge and the second time I called they hang up on me. What kind of customer service is that?"
78,ama_1,"March 9, 2019",5,Great when it works! I love this app. The best feature is how it compares prices on different platforms and presents the best one. 
79,livin89lyfe,"June 18, 2019",5,"Traveling is easy wherever I go I just got back from a trip to Guadalajara, Jalisco. I remember when it was a pain to travel to Mexico. Kayak makes it easy to travel out there and have never had issues with hotels or flights when out in Mexico or in the States."
80,Nelsonal760,"October 3, 2017",5,Great travel app for business This is a great app for business travelers you should allow us to block airlines. I myself will never ever fly Spirit for example. Other than that I enjoy all the features including the search for airfare and hotels keep up the great work!
81,ninjabi,"January 1, 2018",5,"Different prices than on computer This app shows different prices than what shows up when you search on your laptop. And more expensive prices too. Just for that, if I could give this app negative stars, I would."
82,Ebbie48016,"January 11, 2018",1,"Bring back price alert filters I used Kayak to create price alerts to find the cheapest tickets with my preferred airlines. Since their app UI updates, I can no longer edit my alerts or filter the airlines/number of stops/flight durations that I don't want. Also, the price alerts now only serve up a limited amount of results, so if I don't like flights on the initial screen, I can't see any others. Why ever were these price alert filters removed? For me, this reduces the value of having the app."
83,SendingOutAnSOS,"March 3, 2018",1,"Preferences are pathetically limited Other than setting a home airport there are few other options. How about preferences for airlines? I will NEVER fly Frontier or Spirit so I have to eliminate them manually on every search. How about setting a preference for direct flights? As someone who flies for a living and travels often for pleasure, the app has improved but still is lacking. It’s still not as good as the previous one which I paid for and then had it taken away for this updated add filled version."
84,Dr Marg,"June 10, 2018",5,Easy to use Very much like the way the information is displayed.  It’s clear and easy to understand.  Information on the site loads quickly.
85,Fashionfigure,"September 1, 2018",5,My go to...4 all things travel. i’ve never been let down… Thanks guys This is a great app. I’ve been using it for several years and have booker many trips through it successfully. I’m always happy with the prices and the places that I’ve stayed in.
86,Gamerstar1204,"September 4, 2018",2,Good unless you’re looking up VRBO This app so far is great for looking up flight and hotels... but we didn’t give it 5 stars. Because it’s really annoying that the app tells you a deal price for VRBO/HomeAway prices but when you click on it to go to the site the prices are doubled. Every deal we’ve clicked on that’s for a VRBO the price always shows up almost double the “deal” price or more. Not once has it been near the actual price Kayak shows.
87,cheeseball408,"December 4, 2018",3,Flights are great! I always use kayak to get the best deals on flights when I visit home and I fly out twice a year. Sometimes I don’t get the notifications when my flights change so it is a hassle to sit at the airport and wait to see if they can do anything and then wait even more to catch a new flight but what can you expect with prices this low?
88,CaptainKnucklehead,"February 24, 2019",1,"Ruined by removing features I used to love being able to see the total price (including taxes and fees) for the entire stay. Now it appears that I can’t see that, nor can I see the total for the trip or the daily total including taxes and fees. Someone made the terrible decision to “improve” the look of the app while sacrificing the things that made it stand out from the crowd. It’s awful now. I’ve used it for, I don’t know, almost 10 years, but I’m pretty much done with it. Sad :("
89,13khangura,"March 18, 2019",5,Always helpful in planning trips and getting updated info to pickup your loved ones This app has made life so easier and gives you updated info when I am planning to pick my loved ones from airport. Also helpful in planning trips.

91,jd2020,"February 12, 2018",3,"Great, until you try to reserve seats Kayak did a great job of helping me understand the options for an upcoming trip. However when I tried to book a flight it refused to save my seats or indicate they were saved. Kayak was helpful enough to tell me there might be an extra fee to book seats later. Great but I ended up going to the airline website anyway. #Kayakfail."
92,SenorDosXs,"April 3, 2018",5,Tired them all this is the best I book trips for my whole family multiple times a year. And Ive found Kayak is leaps and bounds beyond other budget flight websites/apps. Best filters options to find just the right flight. My go to app!
93,Cikejiikejic,"October 12, 2018",4,Great app...but! Love this app but I’ve noticed you no longer have the price listening in the price forecast section. This was very useful for me and you could correlate the graph with the actual price and see if a drop on the graph was worth waiting the monetary value. 
94,Victorpdj,"December 28, 2018",3,"Became just another app Not great prices anymore. Google flights is where all flights, possible combinations and best prices are found. Only use Kayak to forward the trips and have them there on the app. You really can’t find cheap flights here anymore as it used to be. For full fare flights might as well just book with the airline app."
95,JDP12323,"March 1, 2019",5,Just Awesome! Literally everything I look for in a travel app/website. They have the cheapest flight options as well as costs of flights all over the country if you’re looking to travel but aren’t sure where.

97,Colopopper,"February 13, 2020",3,"I love kayak, except  this time. I bought a flight ticket in Colombia from Viva Air. From Bogota to Colombia( I really do not recommend this airline) they  only charge you even the check in, if you don’t do it online and their web side is a piece of trash. I couldn’t use it. "
98,sushicupcakes,"October 26, 2019",5,"Five stars for kayak! I’ve used the site for years now and the app is great as well. Once in a while I’ll compare prices with other sites and Kayak is always the cheapest. Also very to use, multiple filters including baggage fees, time frames, and multi-city."
99,cythhog,"March 2, 2020",3,"Wow Kayak is good, but when you go in the trips tab it tells you the wrong times and date... which caused me to cancel my flight thinking I bought the wrong tickets.

100,Stankylegg,"November 13, 2017",5,"In a crunch I have used this app for many years. I have done several trips without plans or a place to stay. This app has helped me find cheap hotels/motels on several occasions. Between this app and air b&b I can keep traveling the way like, Care free!!"
101,Suzette_tj6,"January 23, 2018",5,LOVE I keep this app on my phone YEAR ROUND because they are so great and easy to use for quick searches. I love that they have “hacker” fares which combine different flights that will get you to and back to where you need to go at the best price possible!
102,IJustFeltLikeRunning,"June 26, 2018",1,"New Kayak (Vayama) is now horrible No more issue with baggage fees?! Yeah right, using Kayak (now Vayama) causes hours more work than just calling the airline or booking directly through their site. Even if Kayak says you are buying a checked bag on AirBaltic you are not, even if it displays it on your search bar. Vayama customer service is completely awful, I used to love using Kayak but it has rapidly deteriorated into one of the worst booking experiences of my life and I won’t be fooled again."
103,brentgrab,"October 16, 2018",5,"New Itinerary Feature is AMAZING Somehow they figured out how to aggregate all your flight, hotel, & car itineraries into one beautiful flow shown by trip right from within the Kayak app. Uh Mazing!

104,Radventure Dad,"January 13, 2019",5,"Everything for travel in one app!! I really love the way the Kayak app encompasses all of your travel itinerary in one app! Everything syncs together, the reminders and notifications are timely and prudent. Navigation is simple and quick!"
105,Kkbmwt,"March 2, 2019",3,Flight search needs help On a Computer you can search duration of trip but this is not a filter in mobile. I’ve been searching for a flight to the Caribbean for months and every time I do on mobile I get all excited when it finally drops below $900 until I realize it’s a trip for 3 days.

It’s so frustrating.  The worst part is these are fares that show up for days and sometimes weeks.  You think KAYAK could get it right after a few days!  Plus it even happens when you try to buy it using KAYAK to purchase them.  Thanks for getting my hopes up and constantly letting me down."
109,stevenstevenstevenstevensteven,"September 25, 2019",1,Money gone no reservation Kayak just app! Don’t ever pay for them directly! I made a car reservation on kayak for 3 am  I payed for my reservation. . Than reservation came back to 3pm. I called in 5 min and talk w them. They send me to Priceline than Priceline is send me to fix car rental. Fox said they have nothing to do w my reservation. Than Priceline told me make another reservation. I did.

118,tb917,"October 20, 2019",3,"Why can’t we save filters? What’s the point of the watchlist if it keeps showing you fare for flights you don’t want?

119,AnJBailey1994,"September 5, 2019",5,Easily my fav booking site! I am new to Kayak but it was so easy to book and pay. I had to change my reservation and it was so easy and fast. I like that you can customize your trips as well.

127,Smokestoomuch,"February 23, 2020",2,"Bait & switch Kayak uses classic bait & switch technique. They offer a price lower than everybody else then say that price is not available. Sometimes it’s higher than others. You know it’s bait & switch because you can leave & come back later and see the same low, unavailable price.

160,Susacello,"September 26, 2017",1,"Car rental NOT Downloaded this app so I could look into prices for renting a car. I was unable to enter a different date for pick up and drop off. The only info I could glean was what it would cost to rent a car and return it on the same day. Not helpful. Perhaps I missed something; after 10 minutes of trying, though, I figured I'd look on the internet."

166,Beyond | Trendy,"April 3, 2019",3,Love the search engine but app needs improvements Love kayak but app is not that useful. In the explore area it needs for the filter to be one way. And the alerts need to be tweaked to when do you want to receive alerts and how. It needs to be a little more user friendly.
167,Cloudblot,"July 30, 2019",3,"Inaccurate availability Used to love the app. But lately I have found that rooms appear to be available from both snaptravel and kayak but once you click through or share sms info in the former case, there is no availability.

It tells you one thing, you then click on the fare to book it and the app directs you to the airline website where they then bump up the prices significantly. It’s a total bait and switch. Other travel booking apps I’ve tried don’t tease you with the unrealistically low fares so I will be deleting this and using others"

192,Сесарфиш,"July 26, 2018",1,"Prices are inaccurate Several times after being redirected to the booking site I’ve been told the price has gone up, often by several hundred dollars. Also, there is a bug when booking with lap infants where it averages the price per passenger - including the infant. So when expecting to see the price per ticket, you are being shown the price per traveler."

I also was not able to purchase 7 tickets at one time as the limit was 6.  I don’t understand why there would be a limit. It should be in their best interest to allow customers to purchase as many as possible."

The app tells me that the address associated with my credit card is not correct. I obviously know this is a mistake of the system as I am sure what’s my billing address and have book way too many flights online.
206,OOjiveturkey,"December 19, 2018",3,A little misleading.. I do enjoy kayak and will continue to try to use it but there were two booking options that were both listed $142 a night but when you hit book it went to $283. Can I just ask why?

770,Sandrzzz,"March 6, 2010",3,"GM I'm a hotel GM, and the Kayak app is pretty cool, but there are some issues you should know about. Kayak partners with hotels in sometimes very round-about ways, and many times the rates they quote for my hotel are fairly unrelated to what I've actually authorized (usually much more expensive).  "
771,Starshadow,"July 10, 2011",4,"Very useful! I am using it as a trip planner/organizer more than anything, but I am amazed at how helpful this is! I did do a hotel search with it, but I ended up booking directly through the chain's site by choice. Prices were accurate, though, and VERY helpful."
772,TheLongCourse,"July 23, 2013",2,"Buyout to sell out I've used this app a lot of times in a lot of situations, and it used to rule.  I once used it while stuck on a remote section of the Alaska highway in the Yukon, while traveling by bicycle, with the road washed out on both sides, to switch a flight departure from Anchorage to Prince Rupert.  Didn't matter that my satellited-in Internet was slower than the local glaciers; I waited, it worked.  Ironically, I now live in an area just outside of the sf Bay Area where service is sketchy.  Sometimes I get LTE, often HSPA+, usually just EDGE, sometimes nought.  Since the orbitz buyout and redesign, timeouts have been shortened so instead of waiting and having the app work albeit slowly, it says the flight may have expired and just quits on me.  If this were 13 months ago, I'd have missed my return flight, the best layover and weekend of my life, and possibly my engagement which happened two days later!  Gotta give credit to the old kayak that was slownet-friendly, and disparage the new assumed-fast-connectivity app a little.  It's like designers these days are unwilling to push the limits of where existing tech can be used, and instead design for future tech that leaves the interesting, laudable fringe cases by the wayside.  Stranded, if you will.  In the Yukon."
773,librariandreamer,"January 29, 2016",5,"Love explorer mode. Kyak's app is super easy to use. I really enjoy the ""explorer"" feature where I can navigate across the globe to see prices/options to get to tons of destinations. If looking for a cheap flight you can use the filters to show, for example, all flights under $150 from your hometown. Then just swipe across the globe to see where you can go! The only thing I would change is that it doesn't always store trip info in My Trips when bought through a third party...I've had a couple of times where I've had to backtrack to find my itinerary after losing a confirmation email; but this really isn't Kyak's fault, more a result of my disorganization. I just wish the App had a fail safe where any trip booked through them would always appear under My Trips :)"
774,Shadowzrock,"February 5, 2016",1,"Terrible App I used this for the first time by attempting to find cheap airfare. I found a very cheap airfare and attempted to purchase. After I entered all my information and went to seat selection, after this...I received an error message from the app. I thought it might have been from me taking too long so I tried again. I received the same message again about URL none sense. I closed out the app, reopened and searched again. It failed 5x's when I attempted to purchase a cheap airfare. I emailed customer support and they claimed there was nothing wrong with their app. I have a iPhone 6S Plus and have the most up to date software that I should not have any problems. So customer service rating is 1 star rating, app is 1 star rating as well because if I am able to find cheap airfare on mobile site, I should be able to find the exact same price on their regular main website. I have deleted this app and will not use this feature anymore. Do not attempt to purchase an airfare through the app., but I do not know if there is a problem making a hotel reservation because I did not use this feature."
775,Go Kayak!,"September 28, 2016",4,"Great App The best app for flights I've used.  The timing filters don't always seem to work perfectly but good enough.  Also for the longest time the multi-city option did not work for me in the mobile app, but I just tried one before writing this review and it seems to be working now.  Being able to jump from looking at the cheapest flights at a given airport, to seeing only those at what are convenient times for you with a few taps to see if the savings are worth it or the convenience is affordable is great.  Same thing when comparing non-stops vs connecting flights or leaving from a different airport or the penalty if any from trying to stick with your preferred carrier.  A few taps and your options are laid out along with a prediction on whether and the fares are likely to change before your travel dates.  All in all, pretty slick."
776,Rosemary Z.,"March 19, 2017",5,"Better than TripIt I book through Kayak too, but my favorite part of the app, hands down, is the trip organization feature that collates one's flights, trains, hotel stays, car rentals, even tickets for events, into one elegant timeline. It does a pretty good job sucking the relevant date from emails, but it is flexible enough to take manual entries as well. The most recent update finally fixed the one thing I never liked about it — that it would show airplane departure times on the main timeline, but one had to click through into the details to get the arrival times. Fixing that prompted me to come here and say nice things! It really is incredibly useful; I travel a lot both for work and pleasure, and I couldn't get by without it. Oh, and like it says on the tin, I tried tripit too, but Kayak is a hella lot better."

778,PeterSchildh,"July 4, 2017",5,"Watch for travel agents I recently purchased a ticket through Kayak but it was handled by Webjet.  I needed to change the flight due to serious illness in the family. Due to the circumstances, the airline was willing to allow a postponement of the departure but the new booking needed to be made by Webjet.  After 6 or 8 calls and constant reassurances that in 24, then 4, then 2 hours (48 hours of wasted time during which alternative flights increased in price by $600) and still they were unable to change the flight. Airline gave me 800 number that Webjet could call to change the flight, but they insisted electronically was how they would do it ( I'm sure I spent over an hour talking to agent on phone).  Whatever, do not ever think of using Webjet. You will save yourself grief and money by only dealing directly with Airlines."
779,Jvnice,"July 22, 2017",3,"I want to give it 5 stars, but I can't I am a constant traveler and I like finding out cheapest flights. Kayak does a wonderful job with their watchlist ""cheapest airfair"" ROUNDTRIP! They don't have an option for watchlist cheapest fair one way. Sometimes I want to just travel one way and depending after I am in that place if a cheapest flight appears for somewhere else oneway, I would buy that one next. For example. Let's say I do a watchlist for the cheapest fair to Germany 1-way, meanwhile I would also have a watchlist 1-way from Germany to Denmark or Germany to Spain or Germany to Italy, the cheaper 1 way watchlist from those places, I would then go with, instead their lowest fair watchlist options are all roundtrip, so I can't do a euro trip if I wanted, i would have to comeback to the states then another lowest fair watchlist to go to another part of Europe. All I ask is on the watchlist option for lowest fair give an option for 1 way flights. It would give us more flexibility and allow us to travel to more places for a cheap price."
780,EdiPhone,"October 11, 2009",3,"New version, icon fixed, seems stable 1.6.1 fixes the icon great. I couldn't stand to look at it before. How about the title Kayak instead of KAYAK to be even more consistent with other apps. At least it doesn't start with lower case. "

782,Jccruises,"January 14, 2012",1,"Missing fav feature My favorite feature is gone. On flight searches, there used to be a slider for departing times and landing times.  Now you have to choose between crazy early, early morning, late morning and so on.  For example, I need to depart noon or later. I used to put the slider at noon and it displayed ALL flights departing at noon or later.  Now... You have to select the early afternoon timeframe, which shows only flights in that several hour time window. So, for example a 4:30pm flight will not be shown. To make it worse, The time filter will not let you select multiple timeframes to include,say, early afternoon, late afternoon and early evening.  So, you have to manually go in and research each timeframe. Taking away the sliders is a huge step backward and makes this app a no-go for me. I hope the old version will continue to work.  Maybe in the next release, the sliders can be an option.  They were great on the iPad."

Oh yes like what correlation with a set of standards price location quality and service. I would like the app to tell me everything in 2 seconds to make a reservation.

The ability to search airfare for a variety of itineraries is unmatched. I am planning a trip and looking for the lowest fare in and out of several potential cities and I really feel that the comprehensive flight search and intuitive layout of the search results made it possible for me to save several hundred dollars. At a glance I could see carrier, departure times, duration of flight and number of stops (and of course, price!). Fare alerts let me watch the trends and the airport guides helped me to decide if that 13 hour layover was worth it. "

I'm currently looking for flights for a trip I'm taking in July so I really like the option to create notifications for numerous dates and/or departure cities. The downside to the alert is that it only seems to tell you the pricing that comes out early that morning because there are times I've clicked on it to look at current pricing and cheaper options pop up so I wish it would update throughout the day so I wouldn't have to go the extra steps to make sure the pricing is correct. I've even tried the refresh button on the alert page but it doesn't seem to do anything. All that said, I really like the app and love that kayak is my one stop shop when planning a trip."

I love that I can put my friends and family members flights in the flight tracker too and at the tap of a finger see if I need to leave early or late to pick them up. You can forward trip or flight confirmation emails to the app and it automatically uploads them into a My Trips section where your confirmation number and details are right there at your finger tips. It even has simple packing lists that you can keep or edit if you travel often. You can look up flight costs, vehicle rental costs, etc. at any time day or night. "
796,robin3z,"April 23, 2016",5,"Best app for travel! I have used this app for the past three years for everything related to travel; flights, hotels, and rental cars. Every time, they give me the cheapest price compared to other websites or apps. I love the flight tracker option because they send me price notifications on trips when the price gets lower or higher.  I also love that the app advices you to wait to purchase because the price is likely to go down or purchase soon because the price is likely to go up. I have to fly a lot with my three year old to visit my husband in Hawaii who is in the military so this app makes the travel process so much simpler! Thank you Kayak!"

When I arrived at the airport, I was informed that I was too late to board the airplane, since it was taking off less than 45 minutes from departure time.  I told the agent I wasn't informed of that, to which he replied 'It's in our Terms of conditions on our website.  I told him I booked through Kayak and he then said I need to talk to them.  I emailed Kayak about my experience and they emailed me back saying they couldn't help me because my reservation was not in their system so I must've booked it with the airline and to contact them.  I then emailed my confirmation and then I was emailed back saying basically it's not their fault.  No, apology or any concern whatsoever. I suggest you book directly with the airline because if anything goes wrong the airline can't help you and Kayak doesn't care."

Very intuitive and user friendly, ads are not in your face and annoying. I have been using kayak for 8 years now to research flights and hotels and I love the great fares you can find. This app doesn't have all the features of the website and sometimes you save a fare and go back to look at it only a few minutes later and it is not available, this is a little frustrating. Also I have been able to call the airline on one occasion and they gave me an even cheaper fare not listed on kayak. This only happened once. Overall good app, I will keep using it and would recommend it to others"

Low and behold Kayak found us several cars that we could drive out-of-state that were well within our budget! Crazy thing is that they were all from the same companies that tried to charge us MORE in the beginning! I am more than satisfied :) Oh and the price they give you? Taxes were already included #win"

Two stellar features are: 1. the ability to save searches in your account, and pin flights that you want to buy.  and 2.  the ""My trips"" feature is simply awesome.  By sending an email of your itinerary to Kayak, it reads the email and saves all the relevant data to your account.  Now all my trip info is located in one convenient place - my phone.  I also LOVE that they will send updates and trip warnings to my email.  Thank you for such a great product! keep up the good work"

Used to love it, but now I'm going to delete it. I have three problems with it: 1) The import function for the ""my trips"" doesn't work as it only included two of the four flights and left out the hotel, 2) the flight numbers/information is wrong- I tried to manually enter my flights and Kayak's flight numbers don't even match the cities let alone the correct times, and 3) the app no longer has the packing list function. Maybe they got so invested in having people book travel through their app that they neglected what they were already doing right, but I would be terrified to use this to book anything since their flight numbers are not matching up with the airlines."

Now it's in this separate location and you can't sort or filter the same way at all. Can't filter distance. Can't see on a map. What the heck did they do to it? Why is this beed d anyway?

A high review score with low number of reviewers just isn't the same as a high review score with a high number of reviewers. It's a key value that needs to be known up front, not after a few clicks. I know space is at a premium in displaying search results, but 1-4 extra digits is worth it for this info.  Also, in flights, an 'explore' or 'any' destination when you have chosen your ""From where?"" would be good to locate a candidate ""To where?"" when you just don't know where you want to go (but need Kayak to help sort possibilities based on price, time, etc). See Skyscanner and Googleflights for similar functionality."
810,KidKlassic,"April 24, 2011",5,"Pretty Good - Makes Things Easier One feature I appreciate in this app is the map feature when finding hotels. You can look for hotels based on their price AND location simultaneously. That's pretty great. Flights are easy to find as well. The app works great , nice and smooth. I haven't used it over cellular data yet so I'm not sure how it quickly it finds information. I've been on the website a few months ago but this app may be a viable replacement. However I haven't booked with Kayak yet so I'm not sure how booking hotels and flight is like. 5 stars for the ease of use of the app."
811,catshovel,"September 7, 2011",3,"Not impressed If you want to know what hotels are in a certain area, then yay- you'll have a lot to choose from, but after that it gets dicey. The prices aren't that great (or even accurate, when you get to the actual booking stage), it lists a lot of B&B's that you have to either call or email for rates (if I wanted to spend time hunting them down I'd have done it before I left town) and some of the descriptions of the nearby attractions aren't close to being accurate. I don't know who writes those, so it may not be fair to penalize Kayak for that, but I don't consider an attraction 2.5 miles away from my hotel to be ""walking distance"", particularly in the summertime.  The app is easy to use- too bad the info's not more reliable."
812,James Herrin,"November 6, 2011",5,Amazazing! The app is soso... It works great but I feel it could be simpler. But the real deal is the site. These guys have it nailed!!! Multiple takeoff and landing cities and many other features that allow you to find the best flight for your money!!! When I saw that google was starting to do flights I just thought that I hope there half as good as kayak! But I'll still use kayak of course!!! I asked like 5 friends where they go for flight tickets and they all said kayak for sure!!! You guys are amazing! Because of you I will get to see my gf in Japan more often!

There are some major flaws that are annoying, and require manual manipulation to control.  24 hour layovers seems to be the normal when researching international flights.  I don't know how practical this is to be a default, when you are going to need a hotel room.  Also the new version does not recognize your ""current location"" airport.  Using this app in Rochester, NY, and having the ""current location"" default to Buffalo (90 miles away) is irresponsible."

The explore feature is great for planning and the alerts have helped us find great deals when your plans are still flexible.

We got off Kayak & went to the airline's website directly and found yet another price, not quite as high, but certainly not as low as the one shown on Kayak.  In other words, all the time spent on Kayak was a total waste of time.  Is this some sort of scam that the airlines are privy to or is this app just screwed up?

I cut one star because I'd like to be able to type in the name of the hotel I want in the city I want and have it find any & all locations in that city.

As your using this app, your thinking to yourself ""this is so easy, this is exactly what I expect from an app"" then you realize that the kayak app is infact everything that you expect, but without any crazy crashing, or loading problems, or any problems for that matter.  This app is in a league of its own for functionality and it's user interface.  Well done whoever did this app for kayak...well done kayak for hiring the right team!"
836,Anhe03,"April 18, 2017",5,"My go to first stop for flights I travel a lot (last year I was in my home country for less than 50 days all year) and kayak's mobile app is my first go to stop when researching flights. My favorite feature is that unlike other travel apps like Expedia, kayak allows me to pick a range of flexible dates to depart or arrive to find me the best fares, and I can set alerts so I don't have to keep refreshing my search every day.  I've also found their customer service to be easy to deal with and no hassle. Five stars."
837,Marmarmariam89,"May 7, 2017",5,"Amazing Kayak is amazing. I love how the app compiles all my travel information (flight info, hotel, even AirBNB and car rentals) into one neat, nice, helpful layout. I constantly refer to my Kayak app while traveling to get flight numbers, gates, check-in times, etc. The most amazing and helpful part of the app, however, is how fast it pushes information to me. The Kayak app will tell me what carousel my baggage is on before the official Delta App does. Today, it notified me of a China Southern Airlines flight delay 30 minutes before the airline did. Thank you Kayak!!!"
838,nvgreengirl,"June 28, 2017",5,"Love it....what happened to the graphs? I use the app to set price alerts for all of the destination I like on the days that I know I can travel. It's super useful. In previous version, there was always a small graph to let me compare prices over time. The graphs are gone in the latest version. Now it's just the color coding and the arrow to let me know if the price changed and by how much. After a day, or even a few hours, that information drops off too and it just says no change in price. Please bring back the price trend graph."
839,Kathy L in LA,"August 5, 2017",4,"Almost perfect Ever since WorldMate left, I was lost. Then I found Kayak. I had Sex Kayak for searching for flights but now it's my go-to app for keeping track of my vacation plans. Everything is in one place. Flight info, car rental confirmation and hotels reservations. I would tell everyone to download this app!"
840,Davshapiro,"September 19, 2009",4,"Very good app, but needs tweeking I really like this app... Very hood UI, easy to use and searches international as well as domestic great!! I for one love the logo (as they say... Opinions are like ....) but I do have a suggestion for the developers. Please include a way to search for class of service on flights. Especally on overseas flights, I'm not interested in coach seats. I also noticed that the distances from city center points are not accurate for hotels. In Yountville, CA for example; a hotel in the center of town (Yountville Inn) is listed as 3.46 miles away, which by the way puts it in Napa.  Just one example many mistakes. But, overall, very good tool."
841,FollowtheOne,"January 17, 2012",5,"Best Travel App in the store!!! There are a lot of travel related apps out there, but Kayak does the job the best!! Quick searches, easy to use interface and the only one that will let you actually BUY your ticket or make your reservation. I have used a lot of other apps that have full websites, Kayak provides all those features in this one app. If you are serious about travel and want to compare prices, flight times, durations as well as hotel and car choices, this is the only app to get!!!"
842,TravelingOn,"March 2, 2012",4,"Kayak for the iPhone is missing a few features... We travel extensively for work and play and use Kayak on the computer for most of the research. I was stoked to get an iPhone because I felt that the Kayak app would be helpful. Many of the features I love on the web version are missing which makes the experience less enjoyable. Specifically the filter by amenities option. We have a dog who travels with us and being able to know if a place took dogs would be helpful.  Overall, the Kayak app is helpful but I still need the Internet to do many of our bookings."
843,MWerk,"July 28, 2012",3,"Just okay Got this primarily for Flight Tracker.  App a little draggy, not much detail on flight status.  Doesn't tell distance travelled or distance to go.  Was also WAY behind actual flight, by almost 20 minutes.  (Didn't show departure was delayed by half hour).  But absolute worst of all, flight tracker didn't automatically update.  Had to keep hitting refresh to get ""latest"" (20 minutes behind) location.  I expected better, and have seen a lot better from PC apps.  But, it's free, and not a total bomb.  Maybe upgrades or better collaboration with flight data providers in the future will make this app worthwhile."

845,ZachChad327,"December 30, 2015",5,"Simple The Kayak App is simple to use. I downloaded this app because I wanted a better User Interface than their mobile website. Searched for flights fairly fast, and it shows prices that other sites are offering tickets for, for the exact trip you're planning. Also, gives you Kayak's very own forecast, and/or opinion of whether or not to purchase the tickets you've searched for, based on price increases in the recent days. Had a Flight Tracker which is also pretty cool. Haha. "
846,markcleonard,"March 9, 2016",4,"Needs better settings I like using this app to search for flights. It's functional and easy to use. However I think it needs better settings. For example, I would like to be able to toggle a setting so that I can always search for only direct flights. I am generally only searching for short flights, and when the top of the search results is dominated by flights that have a change and long layover (10 hours for what should be a 1.5 hour flight) just because they are cheaper, it is a pretty bad experience."
847,Jsylmd,"September 15, 2016",5,"Using for several years My go to app. Much easier than on the computer with no pop ups. I have compared other sites and the prices are all the same, plus this app shows you competitor site prices anyway. I booked a car recently on the shuttle to the airport last flight. Very quick and easy. A little more tedious for Southwest and a few other airlines, but now connects you to their outside website through the app. Will keep using it, especially with continuing improvements."
848,MelBergy201,"July 11, 2017",2,"Can't pick the dates I want I just recently downloaded the app for my iPad. Picked the flight locations, moved on to the date...and have been unable to pick a date. XD App is just not working right, I try and click the date I want, it picks a random date months before or after, and no amount of clicking around changes this. It's constantly picking a random date.

849,DCdude2015,"September 5, 2017",4,"Great app - could be killer with some additions The Kayak team has done a tremendous job with the mobile app - loads of features for the discerning traveler. The 2 other must-have features I'd love to see added in the flight filters are 1) exclude trips with different starting/ending airports and 2) exclude ""basic economy"" fares. The desktop website already includes #1 ; it just needs to be added to the mobile app. And calling out basic economy fares in the search results is a good start, but doesn't go far enough. Users need to be able to filter out those fares. Thanks Kayak!"

851,Brandon Benenati,"October 11, 2010",5,"Missing just one thing... In Trips I love this app and especially the Trips feature. I just discovered this after returning from a NYC trip when I used the TripIt app. After having compared both itineraries, I preferred Tripit's display because it was larger, easier to understand and had details that Kayak did not that I thought were important. I took the train, so knowing the details of train number and type was very useful when reading train schedules at the station since my stop was not displayed at the station (since it was a midway stop) So I guess to sum it up:"

Highly recommend it.
855,Fireslayer805,"March 28, 2012",5,"Great app This app is so user friendly. I am a sucker for detail, so I noticed that the keyboard on either my iPhone or my iPad will automatically convert to whatever is relevant to the field I am typing in, on this app. A lot of apps don't do that and it's very frustrating...for me anyways. 5 stars for sure, although I had one crash when I was submitting my auto fill information, and that happened first time I used it. Didn't do it again do far. I highly recommend solely based on it's user friendliness. Thanks kayak."

I'm trying to figure out how I can keep a trip saved and then look/compare other flights. It may be available already I just haven't figured it out. But like I said, KAYAK is always the first place I go as there were other sites I went to also. But KAYAK gets my business."
857,Malchik_ua,"January 27, 2016",5,"Best flight search app out there I've been using Kayak for at least five years and it's the best air fare finder app out there, hands down.  The filters work, the site loads fast, very intuitive layout, and you've got 95% of all the domestic and international airline represented.   No other search site is as good, not Priceline or Cheapoair, or any direct airline websites.  "

It's the first tool I go to when checking flights. It's easy to change the parameters to find what best suits you. Also, the price alerts are valuable. Also use it to check for cars. It also searches hotels although I usually use Tripadvisor for that. Got some other features I want to try out that seem nice, just haven't explored them yet."

I can't tell you the number of times I've used this while in an airport when my flight was goofed. it's a perfect app for last minute arrangements as well as planning ahead.

864,blazer,"September 3, 2012",4,"Simple app, beautiful interface Honestly very few people have time to search in depth for fares from their phone that they wouldn't just go and grab a laptop so I love that this app makes quick and thorough/ comprehensive  searches for fares and hotels easy and shareable in a few seconds.  I like that filters come after the main search to make the initial search easy.  Other apps restrict you to less carriers or they over complicate the search.  If you want complicated that's cool.  But I'd you want simple an quick this apps for you."

I am able to lock in flights that I otherwise could not lock in with the airlines 3rd party site. No matter how many times I searched the flight...Kayak did not inflate the cost like other websites do. I will use them again!"
866,jbspitt,"December 28, 2015",5,My go to travel app! We are traveling more. My automatic first move to test out the financial viability of a proposed trip is to go into Kayak and put in the dates. At once I know: it is or is not feasible to think further about it. A second step then is to put in the proposed travel dates over time and get a idea of what will turn out be the best price and the best time to buy. The third step is of course to then make the purchase. For example: we will be visiting family in Australia in March!
867,于瞳,"February 26, 2016",5,"The most convenient booking app ever! I've been introduced to Kayak last year when I was booking my flight to China, it was so convenient, fast, Simple, and easy to understand, it compares the price of different airline and give you the best option. Ever since then, I booked all of my flight through this app, thank you so much for made my life easier! Very helpful! (Additional information, I never rated an app before. Kayak was so good, I would feel guilty if I don't rate :))"

869,Masakisosp,"November 18, 2016",5,Better than most Wish Kayak would drop some shady booking sites that receive poor reviews from users. After booking/payment an airfare third party site unilaterally changed a departure date on an international trip with just an email notification. If other reviews about the third party are to be believed many other customers experienced travel delays or outright cancellation while enroute. Kayak? Why promote these other businesses that damage to your brand?
870,fannie lou hamer,"June 27, 2009",4,whatever the issue was with the touch is fixed downloaded this app months ago and it would never load on my iPod touch. then all the reviews said it crashed more than a commuter jet so I figured I wasn't missing anything. issues fixed now. working well. I like that when it takes u to off the 'site' and to the third parties like orbitz and cheaptickets it doesn't automatically open up their clunky websites but instead gives u am option to call and book right from your phone. smaaaht.

If you like to waste your money and buy the first expensive ticket you see then please by all means do not download this app - otherwise you'd be a fool not to....it is such a great and easy tool to use on your phone/iPod/iPad to be able to compare many airlines/hotels/car rentals all at once and then get the best bang for your dollar.
873,Not543,"May 14, 2013",3,"Kayak-Vayama In the past 6 months, all flights  I have tried to purchase (totaling 3) with the Kayak-Vayama partnership have not been successful. Other flights purchased, such as through Kayak-Travelocity, have been fine. The wait between notifications is ridiculous just to see whether or not my purchase is successful. How does Vayama not know what flights are available and for what prices?? Shouldn't they be required to verify this before posting on Kayak? It's a waist of time, especially as I watch to make sure my credit card is credited back the money. Disappointed in Kayak."
874,TaliaCeline,"April 23, 2014",5,Super functional/User Friendly I love this app for a couple reasons. For one the layout is simple yet aesthetically pleasing. You have options to search for cars/hotels/flights. My favorite thing about the app is when you search for flights it will tell you how many seats are left as well as the percentage of how often the plane is on time.
875,Marcy_Link,"February 4, 2016",5,"Excellent! I've never traveled by plane before so I've never had to buy tickets or do all that junk before. Before I used this app I was everywhere on the internet trying to find a cheap tickets but everywhere I looked we're all like 1000!!! But kayak was able to find all the cheap stuff but for like half the price, lol just like the commercial, I'm definitely gonna have to start using it for everything and not just booking flights"

Right now, I have about six flights in the price alert section to watch them. Unfortunately, Kayak must've done an upgrade and I can no longer see the price of the flights in the price alert section.  I have to individually click on every flight to see the price.  I thought the purpose of price alert was to save time by just quickly seeing the price of the flight.  Please when you upgrade, add the price of the flight back to price alerts."

Every time I clicked on a great priced flight and tried to book it, when it redirected me to the airline website all of a sudden the prices were nearly $100+ more. When I go back and refresh the flights, kayak still has the super low price. It still had them listed even a day or two later! Come on, at least keep your prices up to date!! I ended up just going on the computer and using google flights to book. Super disappointed in kayak."

For the savvy traveler, looking for bargains and hidden cities it is best to use the web app I am rating five stars. Best part is the filter  and look at connecting cities. All up a good tool to narrow the fight for cheaper airfares once you get used to small keyboard issues.  Best on iPhone .  Booking ya generally easy and accomplishes the need pretty quickly.   Checking in us a plus as well.   Fir a free app pretty well done!"

Only wish is the search to be a little more broad, I.E. typing in a country should give a list of airports instead of... No results.      EDIT..... Love the new features, the HUGE hotel address is a great idea and I will use it often. That said there is room to expand, perhaps a currency converter would be a good thing to add so you know how much the fare is going to cost?"

Once I saw that they had an app I downloaded it on my phone and put in my parameters for what I wanted. Within a few days the option popped up and I found a $90 flight! It was incredible. I would highly recommend this app if you're looking for a cheap way to get around or really good prices.
886,Joe928,"February 20, 2016",5,The best travel app. I travel frequently and use the app to find the best air/car/hotel options for me. I mostly find the app extremely useful to keep all of my travel documents in one place. Not only are they kept organized but copies of the emails are easily accessible. Simply send your email confirmation to Kayak and they do all the work. I've tried others but keep coming back to Kayak. Currently it's the only travel app I use.
887,Andres0792,"March 24, 2016",5,"Needs more settings The app works perfectly and it takes you to the most inexpensive airlines out there. However, I would like to be able to edit what days I would like to set on my price alerts. For example, currently the weekends are default as Friday through Monday.

I also very much like the tracking feature and the alerts for flight prices."

They changed up where you say exact dates or +1/-1 and it confused me for a couple days till I caught on that you do it when picking days off the calendar. I had previously tried using the alerts and they didn't ever work. I never got notified. I've tried it with the newest update so we will see if that works or not.
899,Deleted all my videos,"December 24, 2016",5,"Great way to check flights Wouldn't recommend purchasing them on this, but a great way to look at options. Also would recommend ITA software's app to be able to check all sorts of derivations of flight options, but would then go direct to airline to purchase for best service if you ever have issues. Southwest Airlines doe not participate in these so if you are in their market, have to search with them alone."

Using Kayak made this ""flying without a net"" approach work to perfection.  Being able to sort hotels/motels by price, classy or nearby couldn't have been easier.  Pics in most cases, descriptions and then tap to call and then either look on the included map or copy the address into Maps and get iPhone navi.  Nice job!"

I can literally plan-out and purchase just about everything for my vacation through this app! All the features work seamlessly and the ease of use is remarkable! Even allows u to send a maps with your location to others which is super smart! (Haven't used it yet but I feel it will be very useful later!) 2 thumbs up!
902,Tosakol Boonklan,"June 4, 2011",5,Quickest and most efficient Kayak has turned into my travel app and site of choice. I actually prefer the IPad experience the best because of the map where you can just see the available low fares from around the world. Makes me want to travel more! 
903,RedCorners999,"June 13, 2011",5,"Outstanding This app puts almost every travel website to shame. I'm a spur of the moment type of person and I love being able to quickly see how much a trip to see family or friends cost. I wish it was easier to buy tickets in the app but I understand that's an airline thing rather than an app problem. (AIrlines have yet to understand that the easier it is to buy, the more you sell)."
904,JayRye,"February 21, 2016",4,"Very good I prefer the simplicity of this app over travelocity or other related apps. The car rental section can be a bit glitchy for whatever reason. Additionally, it seems they've removed the ability to create alerts for searches on the mobile app. These are still available using the website. Overall, I've been very happy with Kayak over the past 5 or 6 years. Their prices always reflect or are lower than prices iced found on provider websites."
905,Desimo86,"July 29, 2016",5,"Great app I use Kayak all the time and it works great. I'm a big fan of the flight booking side of it. Best I've seen. The hotel search is awesome as well with one suggestion. You should add a feature to allow searching by room type. If my wife and I are traveling, I don't want to book a room and find out it is double fulls! I would prefer to search only hotels rooms with a single king. Just a thought. Thanks for the app!"
906,Mhead10,"November 28, 2016",4,"Sign in to see locations, Bad IDEA! I've been using this app for a long time now and I must say that the new update really made no since at all. When you type in a location nothing pops up you have to hit the signin button which is dumb. What if someone does not want to sign in they would stop using this app because of the roadblocks that have be put in the way of their search. Once again too many steps to complete one task makes no since!"
907,Misstaxday,"January 22, 2017",5,"Fabulous app and Time Saver! This app saved me when I was studying abroad. Not only can you shop and compare cheap flights, you can set up reminders if a flight you're looking at goes down in price! The only (downside?) is that super budget airlines (i.e. Ryan Air) don't get listed in the search results. A bad thing if you're looking to save even more money, but as a Ryan air passenger get, the extra hundred might be worth it :)"
908,jeannedel,"February 10, 2017",5,Amazing savings! Used Kayak to buy airfare thru Priceline that was $450 less than the same fare on priceline's own website!! It was frustrating to see that same airfare drop another $300 in a few days after I purchased mine-which of course is non refundable! Kayak was great about price alerts tho. Always feel buying airfare is like haggling for a car or playing the stock market!! Grrrrr! Kayak will be my go to site from now on!
909,The man who never was,"August 27, 2017",4,"Could be better Works OK but could easily be better. It would be nice to set minimum layover in a finer increment than whole hours.  It would also be helpful to set the class of travel since this will only display the basic economy fare (which is no bags no carry on), so the prices aren't quite right for what I'm looking for. And as another reviewer has mentioned, it would be nice if my search filter preferences could be saved rather than having to re-enter them."
910,Alex5621,"September 27, 2009",5,Fantastic I'm useing the 3.0 beta 5 software and the app worked first time. Perfectly. It worked as well as the website. Showed results before the search was finished. Then finished and updated the results. Was about as fast as the site. But looked sleeker and cooler. This app is worth getting. These people with Internet problems are wrong. It worked perfectly for me. It's as good as the website. But made for your phone.
911,monocuco,"December 24, 2011",1,"Vayama ruins an otherwise great app. Kayak is a great service and this app is flawless except for one ""little""thing. I'm  only giving them 1 star in hopes that this brings some attention to their poor judgement in featuring Vayama in their search results."
912,Maximo$1988,"June 8, 2012",5,"So neat !!! I love this app it is so helpful in so many ways. I still do not think I have found all the helpful things within this app not for lack of organization, but there is just so many neat things about this app. My favorite part is the ""buzz"" part, because my husband and I don't have exact dates for our trips we just put the info in and swipe for the best timing deal. I love the app. Great job to whomever it may concern."
913,Triple Leo the Lion,"February 20, 2013",5,"Best Travel App Ever! As a business owner, educator and a person with lots of family spread all over the US who travels a lot, I have used many flight, hotel and car rental apps, but never has one been as totally comprehensive, easy to use, effective and awesome as KAYAK! It has literally saved me hundreds if not thousands of dollars already at NO COST to download. Truly an essential app that I highly recommend!!!! Two texting thumbs up!!!!"
914,Cokeboy420,"December 27, 2013",5,Good app for on-the-go planning Works conveniently for researching flights or trips on-the-go.
915,benvreed,"August 29, 2014",5,"Kayak = iOS Travel! Kayak is a must have iOS app for travel!  Whenever there is a flight I need to get a quote for, I head over to Kayak. It shows me all the competitive prices and even includes the airline's fees. It can remember your info and auto fill the booking info (if you set it to). Also, the fact that they optimized for iPhone 5 makes it even better. I would definitely recommend."
916,j_carro11,"January 8, 2015",5,Flight/Hotel savior Looking for a hotel for the night? Trying to find a last minute flight to sunny Florida? All at a reasonable price? Well you are in luck with Kayak.
917,The Tatipatomus,"October 3, 2016",5,"Easy to use The app is just as easy to use as the website is. I love it. My only complaint is that not all the airlines allow Kayak to include their flights which is annoying. If you really want to compare all the prices you have to use Kayak and a few direct airline sites as well. But the app is great, I am on it all the time looking for the cheapest flights to go see my family constantly!"
918,Givemongoball,"July 1, 2017",5,Great trip planning and tracking I like the trip tracking feature. I also didn't know anything about a destination I was traveling to and kayak has a whole research feature to help you figure out what kinds of activities are available at the destination. Very cool.
919,❣️🌹Azzy🌹❣️,"August 30, 2017",5,Amazing🌹❣️ If I could rate this 10 stars I would this app helped me get through terminals when I was traveling by myself for the first time❣️ it had let me know when my flight was delayed too❣️ So get this app it's totally worth it! Oh one more thing If your a minor like me your gonna have to go to the actual airline depending who your flying with❣️ But other than that This app is definitely worth it❣️- Azzy🌹❣️
920,joshlobel,"September 22, 2009",2,"ok app i never used the previous version of this app which others seem to rave about. i would say it is ok to get a general sense of airline prices while you are on the go, but after reading other reviews, i would not book my travel based on results from this app. as noted elsewhere, this app does crash frequently. regarding the icon, it appears the designers didn't make the background behind the ""K"" different enough from the iphone background, so it looks like the icon has different proportions - not a deal-breaker for me, but it does look odd and i agree that it should be fixed."
921,Supersocko,"November 11, 2010",5,"Essential! As a small business flying around the US can become hectic with flights and schedules to keep up with. Kayak, not only makes it easier to search for the lowest prices out there....make sure to use the trips icon which let's you store your trip info, such as flight, hotel, and car details, all in one app! I'm so glad I have come to familiarized with this app...I strongly recommend you use it!"
922,Shorstack,"July 28, 2014",1,"Update removed ""time sort"" filter under search function Thanks to the most recent update I am no longer able to narrow my flight search to specific times. This feature apparently has been added to the ""paid"" version referred to as pro. Consequently kayak is no longer my go-to travel booking app. The change indicates that 1) Kayak places little value to existing loyal customers and 2) paves the way for future feature reductions. A better approach would have been to grandfather in previous features, such as the departure/arrival time search function, for customers with past bookings via kayak app."
923,Showmalley,"February 2, 2015",5,"WebJet Link Bought tickets with the lowest price on Kayak at the time to Ho Chi Minh City. The company with this price happened to be Web Jet, who double charged me and subsequently took 5 days to finally cancel the flight. Kayak need to drop them from their list of ticket agents. WebJet's website is archaic and their logistics are pathetic. Kayak please control your web content and providers more, draw a thicker line between cheap tickets and incompetent service."
924,I like ducks.,"April 26, 2015",1,"Completely worthless for booking hotels Kayak app routinely shows hotel listings that turn out to be unavailable. App will prompt me all the way through the entire booking process, including credit card information, only to say that the room is no longer available. Then, after refreshing the search to look for a different hotel room, that same hotel/room will still be in the search results. I'll choose a different hotel, only to have the same thing happen. This will occur over and over again. "
925,Algotecture,"December 20, 2015",5,"Single best app for finding cheap airfare!! The new price prediction/confidence features have eliminated a lot of the guesswork trying to figure out when is the 'best' time to buy a ticket and let's me know if I'm getting a good (fair) price for my trip, which ultimately ends up saving me BOTH time (reduced search costs) and money in the process. Great work, can't wait to see how your team continues to improve it moving forwards!!!"
926,TravelEatDrink1,"February 3, 2016",5,"A+ Travel App! I have come back to this app time and time again, it's way better then Priceline, Expedia and bid apps, I feel this is the most reliable and shows you the best rate over those nMe your own price apps. If you do t have an idea of what the trip costs or are unsure what's a fair price then you never get alerted. I want the lowest possible pice and feel this is the app over those others that is the best."
927,Britt Aria Don,"February 24, 2016",5,"Very easy to use and compare- Super pictures I love using Kayak on my iPhone or iPad. So easy to surf Hotels and compare in my areas. Love I can switch to map view and see which properties are oceanfront, and see the price points on the map. Makes it quicker to rule out inland and hotels too pricey. The pictures of each property are very clear, and most properties come with tons of pics to help compare amenities ( gotta have the best pool)."
928,Wilmatimekiller,"November 29, 2016",4,Not perfect but pretty good for all it does This app works well at finding flights then filtering the ones it finds. It would be better if it had filters like the ones on the JetBlue app. It's has a tendency to get ones hopes up by posting low-priced ridiculous fares for ridiculous flights with two  9  hour layovers for example when one could realistically expect to spend three times that amount for a reasonably convenient flight.
929,Kitty fighter,"March 7, 2017",5,"Use explorer! I recommend this app!! My favorite part is the ""explorer"" tool that allows you to plan your flights se the most affordable times of year to book when your flexible! I have used this tool to also explore cities that were very affordable to fly into. Just chose your airport and month and explore the world and the many possibilities of traveling to places you have never been!"
930,Arazzler,"December 28, 2011",4,"New version buggy! Just updated today, and the new version has some bugs. Specifically, I keep getting booted out when I try to filter my flight search results. (like when I try to deselect certain days or slide the arrival time bar). "
931,Sacoliscious,"December 29, 2011",4,"Overall great app but.... One really annoying feature that they are lacking is a true type ahead for airports. For instance I need to know to type Bridgetown or Grantly Adams instead of Barbados. I personally would like to see consistency with their website where it is smart enough to point me to an airport by typing in the abbreviation, city or country name. After all the whole point of this is so you don't have to leave the app to look something up."
932,KHBucketList,"March 18, 2014",5,"Love it! I'm a frequent traveler but on a budget. I love the kayak app. My favorite feature is the push notifications I can set up to alert me of price changes. I also like being able to see flight cost analysis and best dates to fly data available in the app. Everyone I know comes to me to get flight purchasing advice and I always show them my kayak app. Super easy to use and modify searches, etc."
933,Stu the Jew,"April 4, 2015",3,"Needs Another Filter This app certainly helps peruse many flight options after a few simple questions about your travel plans. But, it gives you too many options including flights that leave on the day you input but arrive on the next day!"
934,Oaktree42,"September 22, 2015",1,Garbage app and service App crashed 3 times trying to take a pic of my credit card. Entered it manually only to arrive 8 hours later at the hotel to find the confirmation number wasn't valid and the hotel had no record of it.
935,Triwannabe71,"August 15, 2016",5,"Nice app, not always most efficient My only complaint is that I'm often taken directly to an airlines homepage and the prices are different. Sometimes the ticket will require that you purchase each leg with a different airline so you need to quickly navigate to several to get the deal listed. Kayak is still great because it can find the best deals, but it's not seamless."
936,Mina65,"January 5, 2017",5,"This app calms my fears Arranging travel always brings a certain level of anxiety starting with, ""Am I overpaying for my plane tickets?"" I was so happy to know that this app will track plane fares and keep all trip related info in one place. It also facilitates dreaming by showing you current airfare prices to anywhere on their world map. Who knew I could fly to Europe for less than some domestic locations?!"
937,Phawl,"January 14, 2017",5,Easy to use Simple and easy to use. I can trust it to get the best deals on flights too.
938,XineTravels,"April 11, 2017",5,"Change it back!!! I liked being able to see the trip dates to and from. I do not like to have to pick and outgoing flight then and incoming flight. Now yours is just like some of the airline apps that I don't use for just that reason. I'm gonna have to find a new search engine for my flights. So sad, because I look at tickets daily x multiple times a day. 😡😡"
939,Jakevhughes,"May 28, 2017",5,Great App but I Have a Feature Request Love this app! It's the best out there. 
940,Lookihere,"June 11, 2010",5,"Very good! I looked all over for an app for flights. Most of the airlines do not provide an app and if you do find one, it's just for one airline.  This app provides flight info for all the major airlines, including European travel. I think you'll like this."
941,Ebr2002,"September 26, 2010",3,"Used to be great, but... I've been using this app for months now and have had few complaints, but the latest update has rendered the flight status tracker function completely useless. This used to be very helpful and was always easy to use. Now, however, it is neither: as soon as I select the flight I would like to track (if I even get that far), the app crashes. After six attempts (using different search approaches), and six crashes, I've given up. Please fix this!"
942,Carbuncle,"January 24, 2012",5,"One of the best travel apps I use this for all my travel needs.  Sending emails to Kayak with my trip information and then being able to see it on my phone complete with updated flight times, rental car and hotel bookings is invaluable.  I also love the fact that I get an email when I get off the plane that tells me what baggage carousel my luggage is on.  Did I mention it's free!"
943,ChrisPoz,"May 19, 2013",1,Inaccurate and useless I have been searching for flights from Abe to Portland then Bozeman back to Abe. Results come in ok but are never accurate. When I try to book with united the cost is always $100 more per ticket and the flights are never the same. Don't waste your time on this app or this company. UPDATE: kayak is still returning false results for flights- on 5/19 kayak returned a result for Allentown to Portland and Bozeman to Allentown in August for 628 but when going thru to delta to book it timed out then I went to delta web site and the same flight is over $800. Kayak is useless at best and misleading and wasteful at worst. Don't waste your time!
944,Supersecret123,"January 30, 2016",5,"Most efficient way to search for best rates This app is my go to when booking a vacation. I've compared it with google's flight search and kayak always gives better rates. Is a great way to compare flights, hotels and car rentals without having to go to individual sites. One thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't always include all airlines like jet blue and southwest air."
945,Lubbersdorf,"February 6, 2016",5,Handy app Such a handy little app for the frequent traveler or vacation dreamer. What would it cost to ____? Could we leave the conference right after? Or would we have to stay overnight? So many questions so easily answered and when you're ready to make the purchase it takes you straight to the airline & you know you're getting the best price with the least hassle.
946,bjgzz,"October 19, 2016",5,Keeps me organized Being able to have all my information for each trip is  one easy place is great. I no longer have to rummage through emails to find information. It's easy to use because all you have to do is forward your emails to kayak and they figure out to which  trip belongs. It's been completely accurate.
947,SandyFromNevada,"February 28, 2017",5,"Great Travel Tool I travel a lot.  Kayak is a great research tool.  It helps me keep my travel budget in tow.  I usually book the air myself because I like to upgrade my seats. Some airline's airplanes are like cattle cars and don't use them.  Kayak gives you prices, travel times, stop over times,  airlines and airplane types so I can make a good choice."
948,ACCiNEED,"April 22, 2017",5,With all options why use any other app. So this is for hotels and flights where I usually find best prices.  For flights I would not shop anywhere else. With all options from stops or what time arrive or take off.  And checks flights within 2 dates cause might see big difference if you extend one day or maybe a different airport nearby.
949,VirgtheThird,"September 5, 2017",5,"Kayak is AWESOME!!!! Take the time to learn the ""tricks"" to using Kayak effectively! If you do you will find like me and many, many others that Kayak is hands down THE BEST at getting your outta town to the best places for the lowest price! I used Orbitz for many trips over many years but they totally hung me out to dry on a uninhabitable condo in Cancun and I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN AND YOU SHOULD NOT ETHER!!! Besides Kayak is much better anyway and stands up for their customers."
950,Paulymb,"November 27, 2010",5,"Fantastic travel app! This app is incredible. I only installed this app to earn free points on MegaJump. It turns out that this app is really useful. I used this app to book hotel rooms for bargain basement prices. You can sort your searches by location, cheapest, classy, and others. It would be nice to add a feature that would couple a few qualifiers such as closest cheap hotels. But all in all I give five stars! Very useful."
951,Ru.Egypsy,"July 26, 2012",5,"Love everything about this app Used to use skyscanner, but this app is so much better. One improvement I'd suggest is keeping a filter activated when searching through different days or airports. For example, if I only want to see flights departing after 2 pm, then I don't want to keep applying the filter when I change an airport or date."
952,Stiral Sparecase,"May 22, 2014",1,"Beware, Kayak uses Vayama to book your res My flight was somehow booked twice using the Kayak App. I was surprised to find that a company called Vayama handles the fulfillment. No one was available on the customer service line until the next day (the phone system makes you wait then says no one is available and hangs up on you!!) the next day cs tells me there is a $50 cancellation fee! After much back and forth, the fee was finally waived however, I was informed that it would take 3-5 business days to get the additional fare amount credited back to the card! Money I needed for trip preparation. I was very disappointed."
953,KathHasGlasses,"June 19, 2014",1,"Itinerary Can't be Viewed w Arrivals/Departures I travel weekly for businesses and have used this app for 2+ years. The My trips view was always my favorite part of this app. Easy to view hotel, flight, and car all in one. With the new timeline view, it's much harder to get an overview of the trip. Landing information isn't provided on the main screen, so you must constantly click into and out of a flight to see how long your layover is."
954,TyB,"August 22, 2014",2,"Doesn't Save Searches One of the latest updates changed the search tab so that it no longer saves your last search. It now defaults each time to looking for one way flights leaving today and going to LA. That is not a flight I've ever taken and it's just annoying have to keep re entering my search as I follow flight prices. I know I can monitor a specific flight, but when I don't care what time of day I fly at or what of three airports I fly out of or what of three airports I fly into the specific flight tracker is just worthless."
955,disneywina,"March 22, 2015",1,What happened to the packing list? I can't edit my trips within the app after the March update. 
956,Phil Buster,"January 11, 2016",5,"simple, useful, reliable This app is really easy to use and has some wonderful features. My favorite is the price alert. In the app theres an airfare tracker. You can set stipulations for date, price, time etc. The app will alert you via iPhone notifications when the price rises or dips in regards to what you're searching for. It's a great feature that helps me get the best price, everytime."
957,Jim - Work Phone,"January 24, 2016",5,"Great app for me and family I've used kayak whenever I travel for several years. The app keeps improving and adding features helpful to today's traveler. The ability to share itineraries, save trips, track flights, add custom info, makes it work for me. I've tested other apps over the years but keep staying with kayak. I use it on my iPhone , kindle hd and windows pc, all seamlessly ."
958,Traceylicious,"March 4, 2016",5,Perfect Place to Compare I have been using Kayak for about three years.  It's the perfect place to compare flights without the hassle of flipping back-and-forth between different airline apps. It's my go to app for searching vacation and business flights.  The alerts are awesome and keep working behind the scenes to track fares when I am too busy to search myself.
959,Talihassee,"March 4, 2017",5,Best trip manager. I used kayak to find and book flights but my favorite feature is the trip management feature. I used to have tripit and this beats that by far! It automatically adds trips and reservations from email confirmations. I can automatically share my trip info with family and subscribe to a calendar feed of my trips. It works great.
960,Tboomer,"May 28, 2009",4,"Doesn't work perfectly everytime.. ..but when it does, this app provides accurate, low-cost flight info, both international and domestic (U.S.) I've already used it to research my trip to the Ukraine in June and it found me a good flight for only $800 round-trip. Best I was able to find so far. Very good job folks. Beware of other, costlier apps that purport to find you cheaper fares but simply take you to Kayak!! Don't understand why this isn't a top-selling app..."
961,ChangoFino,"May 4, 2011",5,"You're reading this? I've been searching for a cheap flight to my girlfriend's country and it's a good search tool. Nothing out of the usual and no incredible deals yet, but probably out of kayak's hands. Mostly I just wanted to write my first review as a new iPhone owner. I wonder where you, yes YOU are reading this from right now. What a world - don't take a moment for granted and good luck with tomorrow's goals."
962,Mettur,"August 25, 2011",2,"Used be my 5 Star I was recommending Kayak to every one.   Now with the latest release, I am starting to use TripIt more.   Why?   The basic item, keeping track of my trips was changed radically.   Now it's difficult to glance at it and grasp info.  It feels like I am reading an email.   "
963,erik1231,"March 17, 2012",1,"Too many outdated prices App doesn't help much for finding accurate prices on flights. When clicking through to book flights, I often find they are no longer available. A list of alternate fares is shown, then when trying to book any of those, it turns out they are no longer available either (so why were they shown as alternatives?). Another one of my favorites is when I try to book a flight only to be told that the ""fare"" is no longer available, and the available fare is hundreds of dollars more than what was shown in the search results."
964,Tomastres,"July 16, 2012",5,Great app I love this app. I am able to do everything in this app to put my vacations and trips together. The prices are great and you can see comparisons on rates. I also like the option to put all your travel information into to app. No more need to have multiple emails and confirmations with you.  It is all stored in the app for easy access. I highly recommend this app to anyone.
965,Happiness is...,"January 16, 2016",4,"Solid Resource I fly about 10-20 times per year, and rely on Kayak, Google and Skyscanner to get a solid window into pricing and market movement. Kayak has the additional feature of market projections, so I know whether to purchase now or hold off for a dip in price. They also offer a feature that alerts me to fare sales and special offers. This is not your average amalgamation site. Definitely a smart tool to keep in your budgeting arsenal!"
966,VIRTUATE,"July 8, 2016",5,Back in the kayak! I used this app a few years ago but totally forgot about it until recently. I have been searching for the best deal on flights for our family vacation. This is amazing! I forgot how easy it is to use and how addictive the fare alert function and analytics are. I'm looking forward to hitting that buy button! Keep up the good work!
967,Optimist-ohio,"September 12, 2016",5,"Great app for frequent traveler Beyond fast flight searches, with good filter options, the flight track, hotel bookings, airport maps, and flight notifications make traveling a lot easier. "
968,jacksw71,"February 5, 2017",4,"Arriving flight information can be wildly inaccurate Great app that completely replaced TripIt for trip planning purposes. However, be careful when using it for determining arrival times, etc. Kayak has left me alone at the wrong baggage claim and today my wife landed several hours late (5 hours) after being diverted to another COUNTRY, and Kayak inaccurately reports she was on time. Other flight tracking apps show correct info."
969,Fiddledeetee,"March 24, 2017",2,"Problems This would be a great app to have on the phone to get your trip itinerary all in one place. However, if your hotel is not on their list of choices, you cannot enter it at all. And if you make a mistake and enter a hotel with a similar name, it is impossible to edit that entry. I contacted the company, they replied asking for details, and nothing has changed. I'm guessing if a villa or guesthouse does not pay them, they don't bother with that business. We should be able to edit to add the hotel and it's address and website."

971,Asset guy,"October 16, 2010",5,"More Accurate Than Airport Display My Jetblue flight was delayed by one hour, KAYAK showed that delay immediately, I asked the Jetblue checkin and they confirmed the delay. Believe it or not but the airport display in Seattle did not show the delay for 1 hour! Also other iPhone apps did not show the delay either. I enjoyed the extra time in the airport bookstore and arrived on time at the gate. Thanks KAYAK for the hasslefree extra hour."
972,gatherswool,"November 19, 2010",5,"Easy, reliable, awesome! Man, I last used Kayak back when most people thought the web could only be accessed through AOL or Prodigy...until this app! I see I missed out on a lot in between. I've never had a problem w Kayak; the data is reliable and I find the app interface so usable I even prefer it to the computer. Guess I'm back where I started -- and happy with it!"
973,Fernando Blanco,"February 27, 2012",5,Easy to use and very quick There's not that much to say to this app rather than I am a casual traveler with a lot of curiosity and this app being quick allows me to see the prices of traveling between my homecountry and whatever.
974,Veloscente,"November 26, 2012",5,"Fast and effective, for an app Though the Kayak app is a trimmed down version of their website, lacking some of the more robust filtering options, it still appears to access the same databases, giving nearly the same results on the fly. "
975,Claudio M Cacace,"January 17, 2014",5,"Very useful. I have not booked a flight yet but I will soon. So my rating is for ease of use. Some people who wrote reviews may not be aware what a monumental job it is to design search engines for such a huge databases as flight, hotel and other travel related information it is. Being a professional in the field of databases, I can tell you this is as good as it gets. So enjoy!"
976,RAIDERbabiSILENT,"August 4, 2014",1,"As HORRIBLE as it is good I was just gettin into the hang of using kayak and their app. Until this weekend my gf made a reservation through them but didnt realize the time was a little after midnight, so our reservation made for the day after instead of that exact night. We stood outside of the hotel for 2 hours until 1AM trying to get this changed. Thankfully the manager was getting as fed up as we were with these guys so gave us an EXTREMEMLY discounted room through them."
977,Pocket Area,"October 6, 2014",5,"Bring back search history! This WAS the most useful travel app and we used to book reservations numerous times. The search history saved time and allowed me compare options quickly. I can't  imagine why this useful tool was removed. Now, the app is not nearly as helpful. Please bring back the history function."
978,Beanilika,"December 27, 2015",2,"Used to be so much better... I used to love this app! The best features were the currency converter, airport/terminal maps including locations of restaurants and shops, and the ""my trips"" section. In the new version of this app, only the ""my trips"" section remains in addition to the search and purchase tools. While this is helpful, if the app misreads your confirmation, or your travel info changed there is no way to edit it. They took away the best features of the app :( I especially miss the airport maps which saved me in many long layovers."
979,ladolceveta,"March 6, 2016",5,"Solid site. Solid app. Love the simple and thorough research that Kayak provides, about flights especially. The app makes it super easy to check and book pricing on the fly, which is sometimes fun to do when I'm simply getting the urge to fly even if I don't buy any flights! Also the flight tracker and updates is super helpful, combined with the ""buy now"" indexing."
980,Debs11459,"January 31, 2012",5,"Thumbs up!!!!! Has everything I need and more and it seems way simpler to use,"
981,Moto-my-foto,"February 13, 2012",5,Better then the website I really like this app for the iPad! I feel it was more user friendly then the actual website. I actually really like having the option to see the unavailable hotels. It lets me see places I might want to check out for my next vacation. I couldn't figure out how to do that on the website. Great app keep it up!
982,Pilikia33,"February 9, 2013",5,As powerful as the Site The failing of most mobile apps which are derivatives of desktop full site experiences is when they leave out most of the key features that make the desktop web so cool. This app doesn't make any compromises but instead covers them all plus a few cool things that only mobile lets you have. Enthusiastic 5 stars!
983,MrActivity,"March 16, 2014",5,"By far my favorite airline app They show you prices from other major flight search engines so you can quickly compare. The flexible date and airport tools are great and lastly I just discovered their price alerts section which helps you find the best way to get to major areas like Europe, etc. Overall a fantastic app, check it out."
984,TravelNonstop,"December 22, 2015",5,"Recommend This to Everyone I'm constantly using this app. Whether it's quickly look up flights or to book them, this app is so easy compared to other ones. Not to mention, the Explore portion still works on mobile!"
985,Maria31412,"January 8, 2016",5,"Saved me thousands of dollars. Kayak, by far, is the best travel app and website that I use. I've saved thousands of dollars overall on airfare from their daily price alerts. Daily alerts are also great because they allow me to become familiar with the airfare costs so when it drops, I know when it is a good time to buy. I love Kayak and don't know what I'd do without it!"
986,High Expectation,"February 28, 2016",5,"Place to go for all my travel arrangements I constantly use Kayak as my place to go for ""skinning cats"" all different ways and checking on prices from different airports times in all sorts of combinations. I travel quite a bit and this  application is my best assistant! Great job! I like I have the option to check +/-1 or +/-3 days for lowest airfare when my travel itinerary is flexible."
987,Lunthita,"June 3, 2016",5,"Best for Domestic Travel For several years now I have been using Kayak's web-based application to find the best-priced domestic flights. I was thrilled to see that not only had a mobile app been released, but also that it's an excellent app! The response is quick, it's easy to use, and easy to customize your needs by filtering for what you want / don't want."
988,g8rben,"June 22, 2016",5,"Great app Easy to search flights, but the real value is the My Trips feature. I use it every time I travel to track all my reservations including rentals and hotel confirmations. I'm emailed updates on flights which has let me know about delays that have kept me from wasting time sitting in airports waiting for delayed flights. Highly recommend."
989,missayyyy,"June 23, 2016",5,"My go to travel app Not only does kayak rock; travel searches are all in one spot, but the app allows it to be mobile. I use kayak's ""My Trip"" feature to keep track of all my travel plans, from hotel check ins to rental car drop offs. Plus the app automatically will notify you when a flight is delayed. Great app because the site itself is great."
990,mercoolidge,"May 6, 2011",5,"Best Travel App/Website I travel often; about four or five times a year, and I love this app! It really helps with booking and finding flights on the go! My only suggestion is to take into account unaccompanied minors occasionally need to pay extra fees, so it would be nice to show how much that would cost for each individual airline. Otherwise, great app!"
991,Phyllis in Dallas,"May 6, 2012",5,This is how all apps should be Easy to use seamless interface. Just booked a flight and car with this app.  
992,jep2075,"June 18, 2012",5,"Just amazing! This is a wonderfully created and presented app!  It really can help your dream destinations become a reality as most of these properties are more than fairly priced , completely unique!!  I could keep going,  I can spend hours on here!  I cam to look at things available in Turks and Caicos and I'm already somewhere in the south pacific!  Be careful travel junkies this ones for you. Phenomenal!"
993,Maylin1130,"May 11, 2013",5,Oh So Handy!! <3 & So great! I am SO glad I found this app right before I went on all my business trips this year! Now I can have all my flight & hotel Information at hand & in one place! And the airport directory with maps is great! I won't have to walk around an airport anymore to find the perfect place to eat while I wait to board the next flight! Thank Goodness for Kayak! :) <3
994,mmsolomon,"June 4, 2013",5,"Best search engine got flights To get the quick idea on flight costs and being able to see multiple airlines and trips using multiple airlines, kayak does an amazing job. With the exceptions of jet blue and southwest , which you have to visit separately for rates, kayak delivers the best prices and layovers. Always use them to book or at least always start here."
995,Greatrluv,"January 7, 2016",4,"Great booking app This is a fast, reliable way to book flights. Even last minute ones. Prices are always competitive and provide a really wide variety of itineraries. Lost one star because they have no matrix for organizing flights, the linear format sometimes leaves me scrolling for a long time and losing track of my options. Would be nice if they would provide more advanced filters."
996,Lady Fairfax,"September 2, 2016",1,"Unable to make flight reservations I tried over and over and over again to make flight reservations on KAYAK, but every time I wanted to book a flight, my mobile phone froze! I thought it was me, so I tried several more times putting in all the information for the airline reservations. However, every time I got to the book flights or even to the save button my screen froze. I had to call united airlines directly to make my reservations. At least I knew which flights I wanted.  But it cost a bit more. Do you think I could get that back if I sue KAYAK?!!"
997,TrinityR3,"September 17, 2016",4,Couldn't live without it I've been working as a photojournalist for the last 8 years in Asia and the Middle East.  Kayak has been there for me to find flights quick and cheap and even helps my wife and I to track each other's flights as we're usually running around in different countries. 
998,nikkhakee,"January 16, 2017",5,"Super app. A suggestion Kayak works well and the price accuracy and links to the hotels and airlines have worked well for me. It would be super helpful for kayak to have reminders as an option. I forgot about a hotel reservation and while it's in the trips tab, reminder email or alert upon opening the app would have been really appreciated."
999,Alix Kass,"January 20, 2017",5,"Love this app! This app has revolutionized booking travel! It's a great app - you can see all of the many choices and compare before booking.  Flying on multiple airlines is sometimes the cheapest way to fly, and Kayak makes that so easy to plan! I love the ability to adjust the time of travel, etc. Also, great alerts when ticket prices go down. A+ app"
1000,e.Shinn,"September 4, 2011",5,"A BIG fan of good design - so Thank You. Amazing job well done on this app. Give your Information Architect, design, dev, and PM teams responsible for this a hardy handshake for me. One of the best apps I've used on iOS. Certainly great enough to get this wallflower to sing praise."
1001,Hoosierdeb,"November 8, 2011",5,Use it all the time I love this APP. I go on it nearly every day. It is current . I like the options offered.
1002,collin567,"February 12, 2012",5,"Spectacular! I was able to plan 2 vacations for this summer using this app. It was incredibly easy to find and book the flights, car, and hotel rooms. I highly recommend this app (and also their website) to anyone who wants to travel. Who needs a travel agent when you can do it yourself for free, and much faster? Download it!!"
1003,Rzagh001,"January 16, 2015",3,It could be better 1- it keeps crashing in the last week specially when searching multi-city flight.
1004,Kinetic Flyer,"January 2, 2016",5,"Best App I never rate apps, but had to take a moment for this one. I've used this app to book all my flights for years now and it never disappoints. It's so easy to use and navigate. Being able to clearly see all the options from different airlines helps me make the best choice and booking is easy. I fly several times a year and love this app!"
1005,Jacks0028,"January 18, 2016",5,"Saved me from missing my flight! I use this app all the time to track my traveling loved ones, but found a new purpose for it today! My first flight in a connecting set ran late, and my second flight departure gate was unlisted on my ticket. Enter, FlightView! If I hadn't looked up my next gate on the app and ran right for it, I'm convinced I'd still be stuck at O'Hare. Thank you!"
1006,Pete S.,"February 16, 2016",5,"Reliable I have used the Kayak app many times to find flights, hotels, and cars in cities across America. Usually, Kayak helps me book my travel plans weeks or months ahead of time, but I have used the app several times in a pinch when a flight was cancelled or my plans changed unexpectedly. Kayak has always been reliable for me!"
1007,Pjt3,"August 7, 2016",1,"What A SCAM of a Site!!!!!!! Just like all the other travel sites, they wait for you to save flights and when you go to the computer site to book them 5 minutes later, all (5 different flights) the saved flights are mysteriously SOLD OUT!  But when you do a new search on the computer, the same flights are still being sold, but ...gasp!..their prices are all higher!!!!"
1008,Texicanlonestar,"August 14, 2016",2,"Prices higher on app than online😡 I tried to book a flight online and got a quote. An hour later I wanted to double check the price and used the app... Well, the flight was $100 more expensive on the app than on my computer. I went back to double check and the price was still $100 cheaper using a browser than using the app. The app didn't even show the airline I got the price from on my computer. Moral of the story: use your browser to get the best price, not the app 😕"
1009,NancyScuba,"August 26, 2017",5,LOVE this app I used to buy my travel stuff directly at Expedia but the Kayak app is SO much easier and faster to use! Now this app is always my first stop to buy hotels or flights. 
1010,cancerofthebone,"December 9, 2009",5,"Latest update made an already great app even better! This app is incredibly useful, and the latest update included a great user interface overhaul as well as the ability to track existing trips, and the app is faster than ever now, which addresses my only real complaint about previous versions. Highly recommended!"
1011,GGirrl310,"October 3, 2010",5,"Surprisingly amazing This app is so comprehensive & easy to use, I think it might even be better than using the Internet! Searches load quickly and are easy to filter down, details & pics are right there, and it finds good hotel & flight deals. Love that you can see a directory of cafes & stores in your airport, and the accessible list of airline baggage fees."
1012,New gamer!,"March 14, 2013",5,Best travel app Love the fare notifier function. I stalk prices because this app also clearly tells me how many seats are left for the tickets I'm considering. 
1013,KiraHere,"December 21, 2015",5,"One word to describe- LOVE I recently downloaded the Kayak app because I had already known that I liked the kayak website. I am very impressed at how easy it is to find what you want and fast. I am most impressed with the price alerts you can set up! I'm so obsessed now with constantly checking the great prices that would normally take me hours to locate!! Love, love, LOVE it!"
1014,Dotnetpete,"December 24, 2015",1,"Non cancelation policy within an hour of booking I booked the hotel in Lake Tahoe area, under kayak it shows as a very good deal and highly recommended.  Eager to try to app, I placed my booking with kayak. Walking into the hotel the default rate is $60 cheaper, I called and asked for cancelation or refund the difference, customer service refuse to cancel, claiming upon clicking the button I agree with their ripped off policy.  I will never use this app to book anything again, any competitor app would allow me to cancel within few hits of booking, especially when hotel's default rate is much cheaper."
1015,furmangirl08,"January 1, 2016",5,"Have been using for years, and it just gets better I've used this app for as long as I have had an iPod/iPhone which was 4-5 years ago. This app keeps getting better and I love using it. It tracks all my trips and keeps everything in a handy place. Also convenient for checking prices on flights and hotels!"
1016,redactrice,"February 9, 2016",5,My first stop in travel planning. The Kayak app is easy to use and comprehensive. Great interface.
1017,JOH_in_CA,"December 13, 2016",5,"Accurate and easy The app combines many features in a way that makes them easy to use, and does a fine job of accurately incorporating data from emails you forward to it from airlines, hotels, car rentals, and the like confirming reservations made outside the app. Highly recommended - both the iPad and the iPhone versions."
1018,SJ Bobkins,"December 14, 2016",4,"AVOID UNUSABLE loop  de loop, this app has a fatal flaw I łike Kayak, I like the price updates, HOWEVER I am getting sick of the endless loop that every time I open It, I get a warning that ""KAYAK is going away would you like the new app"". At that point I have to leave the app as it takes me to that App Store where I am asked if I wish to open the app I just closed, in order to be sent to download the same version I already have. That flaw ruins a good app."
1019,Rainspoetry,"March 3, 2017",5,"Best app for travel out there Trying to find good flights for a good price can be really hard. I love this app because you can look at all of your saved searches, the price for each, and whether they predict the prices will go up or down. Very handy and simple. This is my favorite travel app and, in my opinion, the best travel app out there."
1020,dedge64,"March 16, 2009",4,"Can't wait for the updates! As a frequent road/air traveler I know this app will be superb when the frequent crashes and air search results are momentarily displayed and then hidden by message ""No Results found"". The hotel search appears to work well and I LOVE the filter! As I said before, the app will rock when the flights are fixed."
1021,J.R. Buckley,"August 24, 2009",5,"Should have waited to book! I just booked a Christmas flight last week after comparing all the major travel sites but before downloading this app. I could have saved $30-$40 on airfare if I booked today using the Kayak app! It could just be timing and the dynamic nature of air travel, but this app showed cheaper options and seemed to work well."
1022,Sara J76,"October 21, 2010",5,This app is awesome! I love this app! I was able to find a cheap flight for my friend and it has all of the features that the regular site has on a computer. It's so easy to use and it's nice to be able to look at something when you want to. Totally recommend this app to anyone who wants to make travel planning easier for them!
1023,jg3arrow,"November 5, 2011",4,"Essential Travel Tool Travelers can't do without Kayak. That said, I think earlier versions of this app were easier to use & had more features & functionalities that I liked. Search results for hotels often turn up choices too many miles from the location you asked for; worse those are the ones usually listed first. Be sure to re/sort by distance before booking."
1024,barry_yu,"June 11, 2012",5,"Great app! I like this app better than any other travel app. You can always find the cheapest price here, cuz kayak doesn't sell ticket istself, but provide the comparison between other travel websites. And there is a very cool function there, u can choose your departure city by simply tapping on the map, to see the cheapest price to any country on the world. I really like to play with this!"
1025,Hot Nikkles,"August 5, 2012",4,"Just one addition and it will be perfect! When you go to price alerts > then edit, it only gives you the option to delete a flight you want to be alerted for, you need to add the option to shift them around and move them, because I'm trying to find a cheap flight from several different airports in both places so I need to be more organized!! Please update!"
1026,Ddoll2222,"February 27, 2013",5,"User-friendly, intelligent app! LOVE LOVE LOVE Kayak!! I have exclusively used the full website to book travel for years, and their app is even more user-friendly than their full site. Finally, a website & app that allow you to see flight and other travel prices from all major online sources with just one search! A must-download!!"
1027,Clifftakenaka,"March 9, 2014",5,Good app for finding flights I use this app a lot to find & book my flights. Easy to use and returns lots and lots of flight options 
1028,BigCofNYC,"September 13, 2016",5,"Thank you! Having just completed a full month of traveling through Europe and Florida, I couldn't be more appreciative of Kayak than I am! Having everything in one place and getting flight updates and reminders was beyond amazing! You made my travels so much simpler and carefree than they would have been without Kayak! Thank you so much!"
1029,stacyc26,"October 13, 2016",4,"Great app, one suggestion Love how easy it is to track flights now. One suggestion I have is to add notifications for flights I am tracking. I am not one to turn on notifications often, but this is one I would like. "
1030,fordse,"February 23, 2012",5,"Excellent when fully utilized At first i wasn't impressed because my price alerts didn't seem to be updating.  The next day, though, they were.  After booking a trip through Kayak is when this app really shines!  You can forward the confirmation email to Kayak and EVERYTHING you need for your trip is populated in the app.  Simply awesome!"
1031,TruthSeeker111,"September 21, 2013",5,New update crash The app used to have filters and price alerts capability but since the latest update it doesn't or crashes. What's that about. Please fix as soon as possible.
1032,Jazzlovesglitter,"August 24, 2014",5,Love it! Easy to use and reliable. I have used this to book over 10 flights in the past 1 1/2. Since downloading kayak I feel that my flight reservations are indeed easier and higher in variety which is something I like. I recommend it all of the time to people I know personally who are frequent travelers.
1033,jcbearish,"March 3, 2016",4,"Very convenient, could be better Love being able to scroll through flights across all airlines, and then book directly. Wish there was a calendar function to see upcoming fares months ahead, like on some other sites. Also would like data from overseas discount sites and ability to book there. Seems like better fares are common outside the US :/"
1034,Indiana Small Town Girl,"May 28, 2016",5,Love but price alert issues Love using this app to really keep an eye on flights back home with the flexible dates option. I like using price alerts so I don't have to open the app every day/week. But recently the push notifications have not been working correctly as in some come through some don't.
1035,62tiger,"July 17, 2016",5,"Always the best results I use Kayak for flights. After years ago initially comparing Kayak results with other sites, I became assured that the best results are always here. It's great to 1-stop shop or research at Kayak, knowing I've found the best prices and the best results out there. I also appreciate the re-direct to airline sites, so that it's a direct booking. Always the best results here."
1036,rhkirsh,"August 8, 2016",5,"Amazing app! This is the best way ever to find flights! I've never used hotel booking, but the flight finder is amazing. This is just a great app, but one suggestion: please make it so for round-trips you can pick the flights individually because as of now it's like Place1-5:15a.m.-Place2-10:45a.m. then the flight back is grouped with the flight there i.e. Place2-7:27a.m.-Place1-12:32am. But they're grouped😥"
1037,Phil in Reston,"August 19, 2016",1,"Worst app I've ever used Trying to plan a trip with this app is a nightmare.  I wanted to know how much a round trip to Hiroshima, Japan. I am thinking about going next spring.  I put in origin and destination. Check. When do you want to fly? Options offered are Today, Tomorrow, Day after Tomorrow and Yesterday. (I am not making this up.)  Those are the ONLY options!  Do you want a 30-day advance purchase? OUT OF LUCK!  I never found a friendly little calendar like one sees on other apps.  Anyway, I deleted Kayak and will try not to throw something at the TV next time see the ad."
1038,OlDirtyRambo,"January 11, 2017",5,"Works as it says Very helpful app.  Gives you constant updates and will give it the chance to purchase.  App takes the legwork of constant searching and trying to find non peak times.  You can have several searches at the same time.  Takes a minute to figure out, but works as it should."
1039,TxTrini,"March 2, 2017",5,"Appreciate the expanded airport search I appreciate the fact that the app allows me to search for flights from multiple airports in the area (there are 3 major airports near my city) using their ""nearby airports"" option. Other apps don't have this feature, and this has literally saved me thousands of dollars over time."
1040,Tinkerbethy,"August 13, 2012",4,"Great for booking on the go As our office's resident travel agent, I find myself needing to book travel at all hours. The kayak app lets me do that -as long as I've got service - from wherever.  I wish you could set up filter choices from the very beginning, and it's a little tedious to get to flight details, but otherwise, it's very intuitive and user friendly."
1041,Cklf,"February 8, 2013",5,"Searching for cheap flights is so much easier Use the app mainly to look for flight tickets. It makes it so much easier to compare prices. Love the alert feature, I just set it to push notification every day if prices change. No need to guess the day of the week when prices are the lowest."
1042,1kilokungpao,"May 25, 2013",5,"Excellent App to organize frequent Travel. Good prices and deals are only the starting points for the Kayak APP.  What I like the most is its ability to put the entire trip in the calendar including flights, car rentals , hotels etc and alert you thru SMS. Alerts also on flight delays , gate changes etc.  A must have for frequent travelers."
1043,Lingula,"December 22, 2015",5,"Best travel app Keeps me on track, reminds me to check in, will add things I want into the right trip, allows me to see my original trip receipts. Will handle even entertainment like theater tickets and also Airbnb stuff. The only thing it doesn't have is sharing with other users. I've also used TripIt and Kayak is way better."
1044,Pnut4lLf,"January 17, 2016",5,"A must have for travelers This app makes searching and booking flights and hotels incredibly efficient, is easy to use and flight tracker is helpful too!  So simple to use and helps make cost-effective and traveler friendly itineraries.  Always using this app for my travel needs, both domestic and international (excludes Southwest though)."
1045,Sbwis,"January 18, 2016",4,"One drawback Great app except for one thing.  If you select multiple airports, the results have often have you going out of one city but returning to another city.  There really should be a switch so that even though you can depart from different airports in your area you choose to return to the same airport.  I can't leave my car a hundred miles away from my returning airport."
1046,FootballMom47,"February 24, 2016",5,"Love this app! We have been using the Kayak app for a couple of years now and we love it. It's the most convenient way to search flight, hotel and car rental options. The price alerts send push notifications when airfare changes which helps when you are trying to stay in budget!"
1047,$ammie200068,"May 20, 2016",5,Does what I need It doesn't do everything but it does what I need. I was recently bumped on an overbooked flight from Atlanta to Boston and was able to book myself another flight on a different airline while my wife got reimbursed for the overbooked one. It took a few more hours to get home but we ended up a few hundred$$ ahead.
1048,T'Dawgs Mac,"June 21, 2016",5,Best Travel Search App I use this app so many times a year and so many ways that it is really worth having. I set up alerts to find flight and hotel deals. It sends you notifications or emails when deals in your price range are available. A lot of good options. I highly recommend it.
1049,Mustangsbball,"February 19, 2017",5,"Love KAYAK Been using this app for a few years now. It's just easy to use and in my opinion the best platform for searching flights. Also, for an aviation geek like me it's also cool to be able to see the type of aircraft used for each flight and even filter a search to ""narrow body, wide body etc."""
1050,MacJoeS,"July 11, 2009",4,"Easier and Quicker than my MAC Indeed sometimes this app will hang or crash... but mostly when its having trouble getting to the NET. However, it is so easy and quick to use that I can actually find stuff quicker than going to my MAC and using the WEB site. Coupled with the fact that Kayak is absolutely the best flight and hotel search engine and its hard to fault this app."
1051,Jengaworld,"May 10, 2011",5,Love this app! Super fast and convenient. The app makes it easy to switch from RT to multi-city trips. It also remembers your last search and includes great filters so you see only the results you need. 
1052,LDG609,"February 27, 2012",5,"Really good! This app works really well and has a lot of cool features. The my trips part that keeps all your upcoming flights organized is really awesome. And the flight tracker feature is awesome. It crashes sometimes, but it's not a big deal at all. Great app, definitely worth downloading even if you don't use it to book flights"
1053,Abrehm,"March 18, 2012",4,"One of the best travel Aps One of the best travel apps at a great price!  One of my only complaints are that it has no way of keeping track of your expenses on your trip. Additionally it would be great if you could download ""My Trips"" information to your device such as your booking receipts. This would be particularly useful on international trips where you don't always haven internet connection."
1054,Playtime235,"May 7, 2012",5,"Still the very, very best single travel tool Kayak has been recommended by experts because of its ability to check all the major consolidators as well as airline, hotel and car rental companies sites. I have relied on it for years. Having said that, the iPhone app is still a pleasant surprise. It's amazingly fast, flexible and easy to use."
1055,Kanyigo,"May 21, 2017",5,"Simply Amazing!! Not only it is easy to navigate, it has never   crashed on me, and it works well with my various mobile devices. I haven't tried other similar applications to compare with, probably because I am content with Kayak App. Just try and see for yourself. My guess is that, you will not regret. Good luck."
1056,DNMinnesota,"May 29, 2017",5,Fast and easy Site loads quickly and gives lots of options. The sorting is a great added way to view and the option to have some flex of dates is helpful. It doesn't have the ability to do a search by month or explore an area that I have found. Otherwise great.
1057,Kahnfucious,"July 3, 2017",5,"Really buggy and unusable now The new update is buggy, the ux for picking dates is terrible and doesn't work.  Doesn't acknowledge departure and return dates making it impossible to actually use. Whoever UAT tested this must not have regression tested with iPhone 7 and the latest ios - please fix.  I used to use this constantly."
1058,Donnamom1222,"July 28, 2017",2,Not happy with most recent version! Please bring back the ability to choose the number of days you want to search for either your departure date or arrival!! It was one of the features I always loved about Kayak. Sometimes I can leave either the night before or the following morning so I would use + or - 1 day. Now all I can choose is flexible dates which gives me way too many options and no way to filter by date. Very frustrating.
1059,sammytexan,"August 27, 2017",5,Kayak ! What a Amazing Travel service Kayak is very effective in comparing tickets and buying tickets ... I have used this service many times and never had any problem so far . I recommend this great service to the frequent and occasional travelers . You really will save money and time .. Kayak deserves 5 stars rating in the travel industry. For best rates try Kayak App!
1060,ChicagoPatrick,"July 14, 2011",4,"Nicely done Very functional and handy. It won't replace the ability to compare and sort your options the way that you can on a computer, but it's great for giving you an idea of the options and prices to expect for your stay. I like to look at as many options as I can and compare them, but if that's not your style this very handy app will be a great fit for you."
1061,Crazyxander,"October 15, 2011",5,Love it!! Money saver!!! We live in Hawaii but travel stateside at least twice a year and since I got this app I have saved literally thousands while booking flights!! You can look thru and see layover differences and different arrival and departure tines for each location. I tell all of my co-workers about it every time they start planning on flying anywhere!!!
1062,Traveler (Lee's horse),"June 24, 2012",5,"Great for busy traveler Great to check flight stats, departure times, etc. the mobile app returns higher prices than the actual online app, though. This has happened a few times within an hour of checking each. The prices could have changed in they time, but it's been pretty consistent."
1063,Jeremiah Adam,"August 11, 2012",5,"Great interface Props to the kayak mobile team for putting together a great app. I find the interface very well suited to your product, without a lot of clutter. The loading time is fantastic for the amount of requests you make to check flights. Only really use this for flights, so take this review with that in mind."
1064,Flectrelux,"August 31, 2013",5,"It's wonderful. Very easy to use. I love how it keeps a record of recent searches. I've only used it to book and track flights so far, and I've heard that fares go up upon repeated visits to some sites. This is completely anonymous until you book so fares are always 'fare'. Very well constructed app. Very fast. Even on slow networks. Kudos you guys."
1065,Pokey57,"January 7, 2016",5,"Travel First Choice Love, love, love this app!  Whenever I think of travel I start with Kayak. It provides all the info needed to make travel choices including flights, car rental and hotels.  Very easy to use - user friendly app. And I really appreciate the price alerts you can set to help decide when to purchase you plane tickets. Enjoy..."
1066,Traveling Ken,"January 14, 2016",5,"Intuitive Fast Simple One of the best apps I've seen in any category. Had my first flight booked 2 minutes after downloading the app. So intuitive and fast. No instructions needed. Everything just seems to be right where I look for it. Nice clean and simple screens. Not all garbaged up with ADS, DEALS, ETC. Wish I'd found it sooner."
1067,mkweave,"January 3, 2017",5,"Efficient and easy Yes the app does what it is expected to do. However, if you are a TSA pre check flier, you should problem use the app only to look for flights -- then buy your flight directly from the airline. This will assure that your TSA Precheck status/number will actually print on your boarding pass."
1068,Nicelaos,"March 21, 2017",5,"Best travel app Consistently the best pricing. Mostly use for flights, but also hotels. Was just comparing hotel prices from a few sites; kayak has the lowest prices but also a range. For this particular area the other sites start at $170/night. Kayak starts at $125, but also options at $150 and $165 - as well as non-hotel type accommodations."
1069,PF Walker,"April 12, 2017",5,"Awesome app for travelers! For finding places to go, ways to get there, where to stay, and keeping track of your itinerary, it's my go-to travel app. A lifesaver especially for long trips because everything's in one place. I've recommended it to several friends who've been very impressed by its features."
1070,Tn_lawyer,"February 16, 2012",5,"Excellent App Have used Kayak for years to book flights, hotel rooms, and rental cars. They never fail to get me a great deal and offer the lowest prices. Saves me a ton of time because I don't have to search a bunch of individual sites and then compare. Kayak does all the work for me. Highly recommend this app and their website as well."
1071,Ordnung,"June 12, 2012",5,Simply well-built This is an app where you can tell time and dedication was put into it. Works very well with the iPhone 4.
1072,Kymick,"April 11, 2015",5,Great app - better than most! This is a fantastic app to search most airlines. I have found the pricing competitive or cheaper than most of the big name search sites around. Filters are fairly straightforward and sorting is easy. Also recommend SkyScanner app if you enjoy this type of search functionality.
1073,Gaviotas12,"January 18, 2016",5,"Extremely Useful I have used this for several years now. It's my go to app for when I travel. Keeps everything in one place, very organized, and I can always go back and easily view old trip info. There are a lot more features that I haven't even used yet. Highly recommend."
1074,MKRube,"February 27, 2016",5,"So helpful and easy! Having just used kayak to book an entire trip with rental car, I can say it made everything so fast and easy! I particularly enjoyed the periodic updates about gate changes check-in's and forwarding my boarding passes. The price that was shown was the price that I paid."
1075,b7xm,"August 26, 2016",4,"Price doesn't match I like this app and have used it a lot in the past. Recently I have been seeing that when I click to book a hotel it then gives me a message that the price has changed. So if I keep getting that message for the same hotel for 5 days, why are you still showing the wrong price in the search results?"
1076,Corfu Orfu,"August 28, 2016",5,"My go to app for Flights, Cars and usually hotels Since my trip to New Zealand in 2007 where I first heard of Kayak it has outperformed all it's competitors and gotten better with time.  Not many apps or Apple Computing that you could say that about any more.  Five Stars..first app I have ever rated that high.  Keep improving !!!  Don't sell out to the highest bidder (yet)"
1077,Tobyboots,"October 4, 2016",5,"Does everything Love the Trips function. Love that you can edit anything (Google trips won't let you edit most, can't even fix my flight time that was updated, only takes info from email, which is very limited). Kayak keeps my trips so organized! And you can Share! It's just awesome."
1078,Sox53,"December 8, 2016",4,"Keeps exiting Generally, this is a terrific app for finding flights. I am getting plenty of information and even price updates. I have been, in the last couple of days, experiencing a problem with the app. After a couple of minutes, the app just turns off. I use it on my iPad 4. This happens regularly now even if I am using the app and it is not just sitting."
1079,Howie26,"February 16, 2017",5,"Magical This is one of the most amazing apps I've ever experienced. Imagine this - you type in a city to depart out of and a destination city and like magic a bunch of options pop up on the screen and I then can choose my flight and book it! It's like we are living in the future, like 2017 or something!!"
1080,California70,"March 2, 2010",5,Very useful app for frequent travelers Kayak gets better and better. Much faster than previous versions and very good designed with a love for details. I have status with American Airlines and therefore book my flights mostly with this airline. To my surprise the Kayak search engine finds the best AA flights faster then Americans Website. Good job.
1081,Gm4n,"September 27, 2011",5,"Great application, definitely recommended I haven't used all the features of this app yet, but it has an awesome flight tracker build right in. I'm going to be using this for flight lookups in the future, too."
1082,Taegot,"January 19, 2012",5,"Great App The iPad version was nothing to talk about until two updates ago. This app is great for managing your travel itinerary and finding air and rental car deals. The flight tracker is essential, especially when your flight is delayed and the airlines have no updates. This app has helped to save me a bunch of money."
1083,MandaPOBrien,"June 2, 2012",5,"So easy! I just downloaded today, and I'm loving it already! The UI is so clean, and the prompts are intuitive enough to jump right in. Not to mention, I've found some sweet deals on 1-way flights for our multi-city wedding/honeymoon trip this summer. 5 stars easy! I even prefer the app to the kayak website. Well done, Kayak development team!"
1084,Whatsitwerth,"December 2, 2012",2,"Misleads , compares Apples to Oranges Why is Kayak posting misleading fares? For example, my husband just booked 2 fares on Spirit Airlines, based on Kayak's pricing. He wasn't told by the app he would pay almost $200 more for checking bags, using the counter assistance, etc. It is criminal! Misleading! And Kayak is responsible. Compare Apples to Apples, please the airline pricing system is confusing enough without Kayak omitting crucial details like the cost of a ticket WITH ONE BAG CHECKED. Please. Make listed prices reflect the same perks for every airline, create a standard for comparison and use it."
1085,Tatatalorswift13,"January 4, 2015",4,This review is worth reading Kayak is a great app though I am having a hard time finding any flights without layovers nor can you exceed 6 tickets for purchase. You cannot filter the flights and the flight choices are very cluttered. Every app has flaws including this app but put these aside Kayak is very productive and highly efficient when in need of a flight or a hotel
1086,Vx900,"January 25, 2016",5,"Maybe the best app for global flight search Many airlines and travel apps give you the price quoted for the country where you are leaving from (e.g., the Italian price for an 'Italy to Singapore' flight. With Kayak I get the best global flight, e.g., if the exact above flight is cheaper when booked in the U.S. I am flying a lot of zig-zags across continents and have not found a better app."
1087,Orchid24,"February 15, 2016",5,"#1 go-to travel tool We have been full-time travelers, aka digital nomads, since June 2014. The Kayak apps and website are the first tools we turn to for travel research for flights and car rentals. Theirs are some of the best examples of the apps being better than the website. I can't imagine traveling full-time without the Kayak apps."
1088,MissMayes,"February 21, 2016",5,"The Explore Feature Is Amazing!!! The explore feature alone is reason enough to download this app.  It's a wanderlust's dream!  If you're feeling spontaneous, set your airport and a budget (high or low, doesn't matter) and the app will tell you where in the world you can go and take you right to the booking page!  This is EVERYTHING!"
1089,Flying_Scot,"August 7, 2016",4,"Always get the best at Kayak Kayak is always my first stop when planning a trip. Have been using Kayak for many, many years. Sometimes the trip is just a thought but having the ability to quickly do a cost analysis makes for quick planning and either last second or planned in advance trips."
1090,LucasDad35,"December 24, 2015",5,"Veteran Travel App I have been using Kayak for about 10 years, and seen it improve release after release. The iOS app has improved dramatically over the past few years as well.  This is the only travel app I use (besides AA, IHG for program access), and I recommend it to all family and friends."
1091,Mazeyfrees,"January 31, 2016",5,"5 stars for good reason. As my fellow millennial study abroad travelers know, kayak is THE travel app. Whether it's booking a quick flight from London to Prague at 4am, or finding that last minute train out of Amsterdam's Centraal station to gare du nord in Paris, kayak executes on all fronts. The only, and I mean only, downside that exists, is the fact that it cannot recommend the most appropriate Ray bans to bring on my excursions. I'd love to see a recommendation option on whether or not I should pack my"
1092,AIBU123,"February 16, 2016",5,"Go to app for searching & booking flights There used to be another app I used in addition to Kayak, but have lost confidence in it since it was bought by Alphabet:-( Kayak is accurate, easy to use, navigate, and with its alert setting capability, I am always on top of getting good deals, and comparing different flying options."
1093,Rflang,"March 19, 2016",5,"Amazing!!! I can't believe anyone could be saying anything but great things about this app. I use the trips piece of the app (and website) for every single trip I take (many every year, domestic and international, for business and pleasure) and it has completely changed how I arrange, track and reference my travel."
1094,Traderdd,"December 25, 2016",5,Easy to use Great resource for researching flights. I haven't tried booking on it; I use the airline website. But if you're like me and have frequent flyer membership with multiple airlines and are going somewhere you haven't been before kayak gives you all the times and places in one place. Thanks
1095,Ihley,"January 26, 2017",4,"Best travel app, hands down! I used to constantly cross-check different travel sites but Kayak consistently has the best prices. Love them! You can also filter to time, layovers, etc. that make it really easy to pinpoint what you're looking for."
1096,walkupsidedown,"March 3, 2017",5,Usually the best app for flights This app is easy to use for flight searches and pretty comprehensive although it doesn't show flights for Southwest and sometimes overseas I find flights on small domestic airlines using Skyscanner that don't appear on kayak. Still with the alerts and search flexibility kayak is my fav overall.
1097,Asheia,"March 11, 2017",5,"Very useful! Consistently the best rates. I love that it shows the trip total, and it's accurate! Other sites/apps make you wait to see what all the fees and taxes will be. I also love the feature where you enter your budget/activity type/weather/country and it helps you find the right vacation for you."
1098,aHejazi,"June 13, 2017",1,"Very good for search but would never buy from them Kayak has a great flight search like many other online data gathering sites. However, once you make that purchase you are stuck with the worst support I have ever seen. Also, they don't manage or guarantee anything you are actually better off just going through the agencies they search at (although the one they picked for me was horrible)."
1099,stephrc79,"September 5, 2017",4,"Good app, could use an extra breakdown The app is amazing, but I guess, sometimes we plan trips around pricing, and could uses wider range of dates to look over. Like what if I have a three month window to plan a trip? It would be fanatic if I could get, say, 'here are a few options around a five-day trip during that three month window.' Then I can plan accordingly. :)"
1100,SpaceTimeJumper,"February 25, 2012",5,Travel planning on the go made easy This app is streamlined and functional and makes planning for travel easy. There is no longer that hassle of going from travel website the website think to kayak.   You can now book your travel arrangement with the touch of a finger
1101,Ares456,"December 7, 2012",5,Best ever This has to be the best app for flight booking. Unbelievable! The world map showing the rates to possible destinations from ur hometown - just scored home run with world record! 
1102,Rockycheri,"January 13, 2013",5,"Kayak has made my life so much easier!!! I've been planning a trip to Paris for the month of March. With Kayak's help I'm able to compare flight costs between different airlines, compare flight cost trends week to week and compare room rates between different accommodations! Thank you Kayak for helping me plan an affordable round trip!"
1103,orchestratingink,"February 29, 2016",5,"Love it I use this app to get price updates on flight routes or destinations that I want to go to. I've used the ""price alert"" feature to get good-to-great priced tickets for my last two international trips. "
1104,Ceci22,"July 9, 2016",5,"Favorite travel search app hands down Lacks some of the website features (or maybe they are not easy to find of they are there) like being able to select ""close by"" airports and ""1-3 days"" flexibility in dates but still one of the best travel search apps out there!"
1105,Lulugrahn,"January 8, 2017",4,"Older version was better I love this app! It has a packing list and hotels and flights and everything! BUT. In the older version you could turn your device (iphone ipod ipad etc.) so it was landscape mode, and a flight tracking screen would show up. It would show you the gates and times etc. it was so cool! But the new version doesnt have that."
1106,LBahroo,"April 11, 2017",5,Great update I frequently use KAYAK for my business travel. The app versions have always been good. However this latest app version is by far the best. It is easy to use and provides more ways to customize trips.
1107,JBO MD,"June 7, 2017",5,"Very good search I like this so much I paid for the premium version to say thanks. The free version already did everything I needed. I use this to find the flights I want, then book at the airline site if I can as I find the airlines are more likely to work with you if you make a mistake on their site"
1108,WA&EA,"June 18, 2017",5,Awesome last minute save I had reluctantly booked a stay farther away and decided to look at other options 2 days before leaving.  Kayak gave me several options with great filter abilities and better deals than I could get from the hotel directly.  This is now my only travel app.
1109,Lowquo,"July 9, 2017",4,"Cool app, ok website I really like that this app hooks up to your email and has all your booking confirmation information in one place. That's so cool! The website is ok it's hard to book flights sometimes but whatever. Even if I never use kayak to book a flight again ( although their flights are the cheapest) I would continue to use the app"
1110,PolloTec,"July 24, 2011",4,Great app with few missing features This is a great app. It has a broad and powerful search engine. 
1111,BiggieSlice,"January 13, 2012",5,Great app! Perfect for finding cheap tickets quickly.  I love that it compares flights from multiple sites.  I also like the ability to search hotels and others travel needs.  The ability to save searches is great too.  I would like to see the iPhone app talk to the iPad app to simplify searches from both devices.
1112,Lisa122A,"January 15, 2012",5,"Happy I like this app so much I have used it 4 times on my trip in 2 weeks, I recommended it to 2 people leaving my hotel lobby because the rates are sooooo much better and brought them back to the hotel 10 minutes later."
1113,CoolMrBlues,"March 8, 2012",5,"One Stop Shop Make your life easy and use this app, it is truly a one stop shop for all travel. No more searching several sites, this app has it all. I forgot how hard I had to work to get travel info before this."
1114,Okemosman,"January 1, 2016",5,"Fast, efficient, and reliable results! I have found Kayak and Momondo do a good job in finding best flights.  Kayak does better than Momondo in multi-stop itineraries.  In addition, when you have flexibility, Kayak allows for a search +- 1 or 3 days. With the final results you can elect to book through Kayak or the airline or other sites."
1115,SRFajardo,"January 10, 2016",5,So easy to use Must have for traveling. Gives you everything you need to research hotels. 
1116,Aroddd52H,"January 29, 2016",5,"Perfect for mini getaway The app is decent for finding a cheap flight...especially when you don't have a chosen destination. When you have an expected destination the flights are more limited, but when you are just looking for someplace to go you can find some really good deals."
1117,SSFWGPYNKE,"July 18, 2016",4,"Mostly true to the website Pretty decent app, comes in handy for on the go travel bookings. Loads pretty quickly Has most of the features from the website for sorting flights, but I've noticed the ""include nearby airports"" toggle doesn't really seem to work. I end up having to search each area airport separately and get different results."
1118,Vnethercott,"June 16, 2017",5,"Great new website and app I know this is an app review but I use the app then book on the computer. Last night when I booked a flight the new website is great! Very easy to use, I was in and done in 10 minutes. The app and the notifcations for price changes is great to keep an eye on how airlines do there pricing."
1119,SkyTraveler22,"July 18, 2017",5,"Always impressed I'm thrilled to default Kayak to my preferred trip planning app. Every detail is taken care of: from the easy to search, recommended buy feature, showing competitors and even down to the graphics- no one does it better. Highly recommend this company!"
1120,infuser,"August 11, 2009",3,"Nice Application - But Missing Some Major Airlines This is a nice application to have while travelling. The only drawback I have seen is that it does not show all airlines. Example, there are two airlines that fly into Valley International Airport in Harlingen, TX. This application only shows one and it's the smaller of the two. Beyond that, it is a good application when you're in a pinch for hotel or flight information - as long as you can live without ""all the information"". (iPhone 3G)"
1121,ping shaya,"December 27, 2009",5,"Where's the flex date option? If you don't already use Kayak, you are wasting your money. The website offers a few extras that the app does not, such as multiple-leg segments and flex dates, but it's still better than any other travel search apps. Kayak, please add these options so we are website free!"
1122,AppAddict,"October 16, 2010",5,"Saved my vacation On a recent trip, kayak sent me an alert that our flight was delayed by an hour.

Thank you Kayak!"

I really love this app but right now I'm trying to do a search with flexible dates which produced results, but when changing back to specific dates, the previous results remained, despite shutting down the app or trying another search before going back to it. I faced the same problem on both my iPhone and iPad and it makes me angry to encounter such an odd problem in an otherwise flawless app. Please fix, thanks!"
1124,Konichiwab*itches,"December 4, 2012",5,"No other app as good as this! This is the ONLY app I use to search for flights because this is, by far, the BEST.

BEST prices, shows ALL available flights, and could NOT be any easier to use! LOVE IT!"
1125,Aem1912,"May 17, 2013",4,Convenient Loved that I didn't have to go online and search everyday. A travel agent could have done that for me but I like to be in control. Wish the selection to book from app was easier. Had to enter all flight info again on airline website. I went to airline from computer instead. But this app kept me informed. Def must for travelers.
1126,Fionaishome,"November 11, 2014",5,"Easiest app to use and most helpful! Kayak app is the easiest app to use and sooo helpful. I travel a lot and only book flights through Kayak, can't beat the accuracy and efficacy of the app and can't beat that I can check rates anytime on my phone or book a flight in any second. I couldn't live without it."
1127,rcmercury,"November 20, 2014",4,Super great! I love this app! I can choose locations and airports and do the 'airports near me' thing too. AND it lists prices from other sites so if someone else is cheaper you can choose them. It's super awesome. The only thing I wish we could do was to have like a 'bookmark' -esque tab. So if you're shopping around for hotels you can save one without booking it. Other than that I love it!
1128,Rflang,"September 3, 2015",5,"AMAZING! I reviewed this app 2 years ago, and two years later I am only more hooked.  The ""my trips"" function is a category killer.  I don’t take the time to review almost anything, but I am surprised that  there aren’t hundreds of 5 star reviews here compared to what so many other apps out there offer.  Great job team Kayak!"
1129,Funyun2000,"May 21, 2016",5,"About to book all my trips for the rest of the year! The biggest selling point for me was the confidence percentage of the best rate that I am getting!

1130,g-when,"August 7, 2009",4,Best travel purchase app out there! Love the look up features and the options for looking for flights. I really like the fact that it shows trends as well for a particular destination. The one thing I didn't like that kept it from all five stars is how the flights are sorted and how combersome it is to go through EVERY flight combo for a destination. It should be sorted better.
1131,Chapells,"March 20, 2013",5,Works well on both iPad and iPhone Have had great results with this app.  The search is very intuitive as is the filtering and sorting.

1135,Beediebeaker,"December 3, 2016",5,"Kayak is really mobile first Well done on making an app that is more enjoyable to use than desktop. I just planned a multi stop trip with ease.

1136,Booo Hisss,"December 23, 2016",1,Worst way to purchase airline tickets- beware. My son was trying to come home for Christmas and got bump out of the app after he was almost done. It took hime 4 days to get thru to a live person and they couldn't find the reservation and sent him to the airlines who couldn't find his reservation either. the airlines had no record of either.

1138,You asked so i'm commenting,"May 12, 2017",4,"Mildly non-intuitive In the tech world there is a belief that more functionality is better. Sometimes it's a survival fear. Keep ahead or fall behind. Problem is that there is a line between useful improvements and clutter. Kayak is perilously close to becoming burdensome rather than nimble, cluttered rather than lean, and ""clever"" rather than effective. I hope they choose to not cross that line."
1139,Modell23,"June 4, 2017",5,Kayak works for me This app works for me better than others.  I just trust it and believe that I get the best fare offers.  It's especially user friendly.  I can track flights which I really enjoy doing.  On a desk top I can select different itineraries and also the filters are phenomenal.  I've been slated by the Kayak!
1140,GWR-1,"August 20, 2011",5,Super user friendly! Downloaded this app and booked 3 airline tickets. 
1141,ssbn611,"January 29, 2012",5,Much improved The new Kayak is a welcome improvement over the previous app. Little things like calendar pickers that are usable and easy access to the filters. Previous to this upgrade I would often get frustrated with the app and just use the regular browser version. Good job.
1142,jbmcgee2,"March 22, 2012",5,First stop when planning a trip Simply the best interface and tool for finding the perfect flight available on mainline carriers. Quicker and with more sort and filter options than any other resource. Any business traveler that doesn't use this is wasting his/her time any probably money too.
1143,Dozer.4,"April 23, 2012",5,"Time Saving App I absolutely appreciate this app. It saves me time by using the daily flight tracker (reviews my flight selection daily and alerts when there is a lower priced flight), and the auto fill is a time saver from tedious tasks. I use to hate checking flights daily, but now this app does the work for me."
1144,DeluxX52,"February 13, 2013",5,Best one I've found for hotels and flights! The app has a beautiful and functional interface. Actually kind of fun to use. Also in the app it shows prices on numerous sites and will link you directly to the site you pick (lowest price) if you choose to book thru them instead of kayak.
1145,What just appened?,"June 11, 2016",5,"Intuitive slick UI! Love the interface. One feature I'd love to have is the flight tracker screen remember the last few selected airlines. Or an option to add a few favorite airlines. It's a pain having to scroll through the long airlines list ready time. Go kayak, and thank you for such a useful app!"
1146,Runjumpswimplay,"August 30, 2016",4,Great app with an flaw This app is the easiest way to check flight prices daily. It saves your last search so a quick update displays most current price. The secret is to then book directly through airplane in case you need to make a change. That way there's no middleman. In my experience prices are accurate. Kayak rounds up to nearest dollar.
1147,Ippo_Boston,"October 7, 2016",4,"My favorite travel app Kayak is the app I like to go to for travel.  I would give it 5 stars except in the mobile version, I wish I could select just one leg to see the various other leg options, like I can on the PC version.  I often need to go to a PC to do what I want to do.  But other than that, it's a great app, and adds value to my travel planning."
1148,Zzsm2376,"March 1, 2017",5,Very useful I have used Kayak for years. I like the app...very simple to use for round trip. Sometimes too much info. Often I would like to select my combinations like you do on an airline web site. I usually go there to book for that reason. I get the basics very quickly through Kayak.
1149,jbyron322,"May 22, 2017",5,Favorite travel app My favorite travel app by far. I especially love the Explore function and how Price Alerts show you all the cheapest flights for months in advance instead of emailing me about random weekends. I use Explore to find places around the world to travel to that I never thought I could. Love love love
1150,Match_Fit,"February 15, 2012",5,"Even better than the website This app is a perfect example of integrating all the great things from a website into the functionality of the iPad. I now never use the site and just use the app instead. Highly recommended for booking flights, hotels, etc."
1151,Birdasaurus Rex,"May 3, 2012",5,"State of the art app Absolutely incredible app! It's fast, it's thorough, I find it easier to use than the website (sorry Kayakers!). It's given me instant results that are easily filtered, easily sorted, easily sent to my girlfriend. Can't ask for anything more than that! I am a really picky app guy. This is one I definitely like and choose."
1152,Giantshtoom,"August 16, 2012",4,"Works as advertised I have only used this app for looking for flights but the interface is slick and let's you apply many filters that I find useful. Voting 4 stars because when selecting what time you want flights to takeoff/land it incorrectly displays the order airport names (I.e. it will say ""Indianapolis to New York City"" twice, when one of them should read ""New York City to Indianapolis"")"
1153,IamAziz,"September 22, 2012",5,"No competitors! If you want to know how awesome this app is, try other apps of the same categories to make a reservation! "
1154,Zombifried extra,"September 27, 2012",5,Very useful It's a very useful app. I search flights all the time and it's works well. I have had problem with hotels where it shows prices as $-1 which just means it doesn't know. It also gets very slow sometimes and doesn't show all available hotels/hostels/motels in the area requested.
1155,BigthumbN8,"November 21, 2012",5,"Great Kayak provides GREAT services in a complex world of planning. Planning which involves air, ground and water attractions.. Weather your on a trip for business or excitement, this is the app for quick cross reference. "
1156,Ryan Tracey,"April 16, 2013",4,"Good, but could be better Overall a good app for a great site. However, I wish there was a way to filter flights by frequent flyer program, like the site allows. I also consistently have issues with my history of searches showing up, and have to shut down the app and restart to get them to show up again."
1157,GlobalVagabond,"October 28, 2014",4,"BRING BACK THE SAVED SEARCHES I love, love, LOVE the Kayak app (and website)...but you seem to have removed the automatic ""saving"" of previous searches, which is a real timesaver. (Previously, a list would appear of your most recent searches, and you could just tap one of those to re-institute that same search.) Please bring that feature back! I'm using the app less because of it."
1158,Kay Mode,"October 1, 2015",1,"Kayak is garbage Kayak is garbage simply because it will show you a price that is not accurate when you enter the next screen to book. American Airlines, Delta and JetBlue have NEVER matched the nonsense Kayak fares they push on the app. When booking a flight in Business, Kayak will show you $1,175 RT. The moment you move forward, Kayak will open the carriers site within their app and the price is 30-40% higher. I haven't seen a fare match when booking after 40-50 attempts in the last week. This app is trash - fix your service."
1159,Chris4dc,"February 22, 2016",5,"Great source for travel searching This is my go to app for travel searching. I have just discovered their ""explore"" option which is really cool because you can just look around to find amazing deals to some amazing locations around the world or domestically. Best source for me for travel."
1160,wdemon77,"December 28, 2011",5,"Best flight booking app Have been using kayak since 2006 and always worked for me. I'm actually surprised the airlines haven't managed to kill its business model as they almost did with Priceline. In any case, this app brings all the pros and none of the cons of the website to a little device called the iPhone. I enjoy it!"
1161,rtwhitaker,"January 18, 2012",1,"Deleting app because you pulled ads from T.V. Show I am deleting your Kayak app from my iPhone because of Kayak's ridiculous decision to discontinue advertising during the television show ""All-American Muslim"". I find it utterly idiotic that Kayak chose to do this and still chooses to not advertise during the television program all due to the completely false allegations and racist and hate filled letters of the Florida Family Association. Did anyone at Kayak actually watch an episode of this program before pulling your ads?  I doubt it. Kayak must not believe in diversity and inclusion. What a bunch of bigots."
1162,ajhorst,"February 1, 2012",5,"Sorry, expedia This travel app beats all. Find the perfect flight at the perfect price at the perfect time...plus flight tracking, plus hotel search, plus rental cars, plus plus plus...FOR FREE! Kayak doesn't even charge booking fees so its a winner all the way around. Does all it claims plus some more. Great iphone layout. Thanksthanksthanksthanks.......!"
1163,ShopperGalore,"December 7, 2014",5,"Best comparison app in the AppStore!! I am an avid traveler (100 countries and counting), so I'm always checking out the latest search and booking sites and apps. I have to say for search and comparison, Kayak is bar none the best app available. It is smooth, fast, intuitive, and gives alternative ways of searching and comparing."
1164,M.Salim.Harrell,"January 26, 2016",5,Great app! I have found that KAYAK is a great place to start shopping for all my flights.  I use it often and have found it easy to navigate and compare prices.  
1165,AppManScrithers,"February 22, 2016",5,"Covers the world Many things I love about this app. 1) I always go to several apps before I book a trip. Kayak always gives me the lowest price. 2) I can hop on the app anytime and instantly travel the globe with a finger spin to look for great deals. If you are into the grab the passport and go strategy, you can't beat it."
1166,Love to sleep,"March 2, 2016",4,Amazing organizer for trips I love being able to forward email confirmations and it keeps everything organized. It's like a personal secretary! I appreciate the reminders for upcoming flights and the handy message for baggage claim as soon as I turn the phone on. It's faster than the flight attendants! I don't use the price tracker as much. I use a different app.
1167,BenJlJ,"July 2, 2016",5,Love It! I love it when it emails me about prices dropping. Clutch. I wish they would do it as the price dropped not just once a day. I don't know if that's possible. You know like stock trading where it will automatically buy when the price drops under a certain amount? But still love the app.
1168,Mmnair,"September 20, 2016",5,"Excellent App for Travel Bookings I have been using the Kayak app and website for all my travel planning and I find it works very well. The app is easy to use, offers various options and show the price for each option. Very easy to make your travel decisions and plans."
1169,Lexmac2005,"November 9, 2016",5,"Kayak has been good to me! I must say I was skeptical initially about this app. But after a few trips, this is truly a travelers BFF!  Once you book a trip wherever, email it to kayak & it populates an itinerary for you with everything...flight info, gate, tsa wait time, rental car, hotel etc...it's all there!  Thanks Kayak, I'm a believer & a fan!"
1170,Beau Woods,"November 4, 2010",5,"Awesome app The app is both useful and fun! It has lots of features that are quirky but cool. Like being able to send a friend an email with a map of where you are from in the app. And it has a list of major airlines, a currency converter, the ability to set alerts, etc., which round it out as a travel app."
1171,AllGoodUserNamesAreTaken,"April 18, 2012",4,"Love the app, search results frustrating This app is way easier than a few of the others.  It sorts well and remembers your last search so you can keep looking quickly."
1172,zipmb,"May 26, 2012",5,"Awesome! It is so useful and so well made that it turned this annoying chore that is trip planning into something I look forward to. Forward an email and it making the data into your trip plan works flawlessly, even with emails in portuguese. I dare to say kayak is a truly revolutinary service."
1173,Leisek,"August 12, 2012",5,"Used Daily With our family of four traveling/flying a few times each year, it sure is nice to have a daily notification as to our desired destinations. When I see a price drop, I'm sure to jump on it saving us a few dollars to use elsewhere on our vacation."
1174,DNAFox,"November 2, 2016",4,"Keep track of your trip I like the search feature for travel needs and find it easy to use, but my favorite feature is the ability to construct a full itinerary, including cars, hotels, and flights for your trip. The app easily consolidates information from any source into a readible and shareable document."
1175,droxrich,"November 7, 2016",5,"User-friendly and reliable User interface is straight-forward. App doesn't crash. Several ways to customize each search. Overall, great for flights and car rentals. (Haven't used it for hotels as I have another app for that that I like better.)"
1176,PgM69,"December 17, 2016",5,"Quick & Easy Makes it super easy and quick to look up flights. If you're having a conversation and someone says hey, why don't you come visit next month. You pull up the app and can check prices and flights in just a few seconds."
1177,JGR914s,"December 20, 2016",5,"Love Kayak! Have been using Kayak for quite a few years and it gets better and better with each update. I use Kayak and TripIt, but prefer Kayak for its ease of use and the great features such as show the driver your hotel address. That one feature is really handy when there is a language barrier!"
1178,Coffee traveler,"January 1, 2017",5,"Invaluable flight search Works even with a bad internet connection and is often easier to use than the website. The deals are almost always the best I've found, but you should use ctrip for flights in or through China."
1179,@Franco@,"January 12, 2017",5,"Flights appear for sale before Google flights. I received a notification for the dates I was looking for, and when I went to check on Google flights I realized that flights for those dates are not available yet to see over there."
1180,Gabo717,"May 11, 2012",5,Best app to find travel deals on the go This app is very intuitive and easy to use. In a few minutes you can find what you are looking for and you can always find it in your history when you are ready to click the buy button.
1181,FLMedic911,"June 20, 2012",5,Nice design and search options Worked quickly and easily as I would hope. I especially liked the ability to easily reference each airlines baggage fee policies which made the cheapest flight not the best choice in my situation. I'm just glad I'm not the guy that is banned from Kayak for life.
1182,jaystaystill,"February 8, 2013",5,First time traveler I'm flying for only the third time in my whole life down to Florida and the first time I am planning and flying by myself. This app and kayak is making it so much more fun and easier to figure out the best and cheapest ways to travel. I am so thankful to kayak for it. And it's free!! I would easily pay for this app it's so awesome. Thanks!
1183,Super unsatisified,"March 25, 2014",1,"Kayak is the worst I used kayak app to book 4 international flights and was redirected to vayama. The app told me it was unable to process my request. I then tried again a little later and successfully booked 4 tickets via kayak app, only to find later that I was double booked. Kayak refused to help me. I was told they had no confirmation of a double booking and there was nothing they could do to help me. It took 3 months to finally receive a refund for 4 tickets that literally were booked with duplicate itenerarys. Kayak's customer service is awful!"
1184,lzerner,"December 29, 2015",5,"Kayak is the Waze of travel-booking apps The same way Waze finds the best route to drive, Kayak finds the best flight, hotel, or car to book. Up-to-the-minute pricing and availability; fast, easy filtering by airline, number of stops, arrival/departure time, etc.; and fast booking directly via the provider site."
1185,Navysquidjr,"January 6, 2016",5,Good start.  Keep adding filters to match capability of online app We've been using Kayak online since forever and love it.  While the online app is not perfect it has more features and filters than the Kayak iPhone app.   Good app. Useful.  functions well and so far have not noticed bugs
1186,Ed Tobias,"February 16, 2016",5,Best way to get your vacation together I've been using the KAYAK app for sometime now for planning our family vacations. I love how we can handle everything in one spot and get really good rates. I also love how we can tailor the specifics of the flights so that I can choose mornings or evenings fly out or to return. Really love the app
1187,Dixie Marie,"March 9, 2016",5,"Information I love Kayak! Getting up to date information on the best flight deals is, sadly, how I spend too much of my time. I use this app for everything. My best friends and I took a trip to Vegas for my 21st birthday and received a great deal on flight and hotel. I have no complaints about this app!"
1188,Triviasavvy,"August 3, 2016",5,"Easiest flight finder!!! I downloaded this app a couple of years ago. Definitely the best app (and website) to search for flights through all the different airlines. Although, I don't use it much for hotels or anything else. It's the easiest, quickest, and best way to book a flight!"
1189,Marie55555,"September 8, 2016",5,"Really well set up app I travel for work as a consultant and this is the app I use.  It has exactly the right features to make use easy - and to allow me to modify my search to narrow by airline, stops, departure time, etc. It's fast and simple.  The mobile interface is very well done."
1190,schulzpm,"July 23, 2009",5,Trends is must have feature The Trends feature of this app shows you the average prices and low prices for a given route - showing you the cheapest time to go! This is the best feature and makes this a must have for me. This is easier to use than their web site...
1191,Sacagewea,"December 22, 2011",5,Number one place to go for travel! I've used the Kayak website for a long time and was thrilled to find the Kayak app. Using the app is just as good as using the website. There are various filters to apply so you can zero in on your specific travel needs quickly. I love this app!
1192,Mrs. Lash,"January 13, 2012",5,"Everything I didn't know I needed! This app is beyond what I expected and so easy to use! If you are an expert at scouting out the best fares or inexperienced, this app is perfect! Has a built in price alert system with push notifications for fare updates. It also provides the history for Specific flights!"
1193,Nelliet11,"March 14, 2012",5,"Easier than on my computer I enjoy using kayak on my phone more so than in my computer because of all the pop-ups that go along with the browser version.  I've found it to be efficient, easy to navigate and I've had no problems."
1194,Rickp200,"April 14, 2012",5,"Nice and Simple booking I booked a last minute hotel reservation, and in a few minutes the reservation was made. From my experience, I believe that Kayak's system is simple and information goes through quickly. I recommend this App to anyone who does not plan ahead. 👍"
1195,Jamiwiz,"September 26, 2016",5,Must say I'm impressed. I have more travel apps on my phone than anyone should so I was quite indifferent about adding yet another. I must say I am very impressed at the deals I have been able to fine. Also the whole interface makes everything a breeze
1196,tsnapper,"December 27, 2016",5,"Makes my life easier! Everything is in one place. Makes it easy to find my confirmation numbers without having to look back through emails. So nice to have all trip info (flight, car& hotel) all in one easy click!"
1197,DUO Owner,"June 22, 2017",3,"Flexible dates not so flexible anymore! Why did Kayak reduce the functionality of the flexible dates? Only option now is +/-3 days. Please bring back +/-1 and +/-2 days as well. Also needs a filter for the ""basic"" airfare which are useless for people with any kind of baggage. The updated web version at least shows an icon to identify those fares; not the app though! The app has just become crippled!"
1198,Natarade,"August 10, 2017",5,"Facilitates trip I've never used Kayak before and I am so glad I did! When I was waiting for my airline to announce my gate number, Kayak announced it first! The airports screens didn't announce my gate number until 30 minutes before my flight left! Kayak made my internet national flight great. Thank you"
1199,Acissejjessica12355,"September 12, 2017",4,"Use it all the time I wear quite the path between Chicago and NYC. I use Kayak every time I need to fly. I love the app - very intuitive. I used Kayak online well before it had an app...I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I used to easily be able to filter to make the departure and return airport the same, but I can't seem find that feature now."
1200,Myratfink,"February 20, 2012",5,"Ultimate airfare search This is the way shopping for airfare should have always been. After you see how brilliantly simple and thorough this app is, you will wonder why we've had to muddle through hours of ineffective research and dozens of websites to find the lowest fare for the past 15 years. I have been liberated!"
1201,jordencollins,"May 7, 2012",1,"Lost my reservation!!! Absolutely pathetic. I booked a hotel room for my husband in San Francisco, paid for it al on Kayak. He went to check in yesterday and NO RESERVATION!!! The hotel calls Kayak and the kayak operator claims to have faxed the reservation info to the hotel, even though the hotel does not take reservations by fax. You'd think kayak would know how to make reservations with their vendors. Also, even though my credit card had been billed the payment issue was not resolved at checkin and Needless to say my husband didn't get into his room till past midnight."
1202,Azdren,"August 2, 2012",4,"The best travel app I've used to date Minor flaws in the ticket equation software prevented me from giving this app 5 *, (ie. When making flight routes for multiple destinations the price is excessively inflated as opposed to selecting and purchasing the same flights individually) but all in all the app is very helpful in helping plan a trip and getting an idea of what to expect."
1203,CinemaMishmash,"August 24, 2012",5,Bug in price alerts Really useful app with a big problem in one of its best features: the price alerts. When I chose to monitor a specific route on specific dates the date parameters are sometimes off (usually by one day) in the created listing (and even in the resulting email).
1204,Progsv10S,"December 13, 2012",2,"Flight Tracker Feature Unreliable I primarily used this app to track flight status & gate changes.  Unfortunately, it's been slow to notify or doesn't notify at all any last minute gate changes.  On several recent occasions, I found myself sitting at what I thought was the correct gate only to find out that the gate was changed 15-20 minutes beforehand. So I will instead rely on the old fashion method of reading the flight status screens at the airport."
1205,Dave from va,"February 7, 2013",5,"Excellent app and service Whether you access Kayak from your iPhone, iPad, or the home site your experience will always be enjoyable.  You can always find the best prices and services in travel by using Kayak.  Now with a mobile version I can use it everywhere and any time."
1206,iNateHop,"February 10, 2013",5,User Friendly!!! Like All Options! I downloaded 4 different apps to find accommodations for spring break.  This app is what it says it is... Kayak made my experience to compare shop for best rates for our large group a success! I've already highly  recommended it to family & friends.  Enjoy w/ confidence!
1207,Chamito Candela,"September 17, 2013",5,"Outstanding Allows me to keep track of always changing prices, the chart is amazing, I would recommend this app to anyone trying to get a ticket, don't buy the first time though, set an alert and monitor. On my case best price was 5 days before the flight 50% difference."
1208,udfan77,"February 8, 2016",5,"Fantastic, user friendly, great updates! Kayak continues to make improvements on a reliable, useful app making it a top-notch option for all travelers. The latest updates make it even easier to find the best prices without using a computer. Thank you Kayak!!"

1210,The Red Ranchero Girl,"April 19, 2011",5,"Good travel app Seems to do the same thing as the paid version. No annoying ads. Fast searches, lots of places to choose from. I wish there was a way to look at different room upgrades within the same hotel! But so far it's the best I've found."
1211,JayandColette,"July 3, 2011",2,"Would be good if it generated accurate prices I can't even imagine what people are raving about with this app.  Search results return prices for hotels - but when drilling down on a specific hotel, it gives a significantly higher price than is reflected in the results list for at least 30-40% of the locations. (and, no... I don't mean the slightly higher price that reflects fees/taxes).  Plus it has crashed when viewing maps & pics within the app on my iPad."
1212,Odom-duang-cet,"December 21, 2011",5,"A quick easy travel site comparison app Does exactly what it's supposed to. Clean fluid interface, quick, accurate results, and since it's comparing multiple other sites it gets you the best deal. Highly recommended to anyone who is going to anywhere."
1213,Michael Thompson,"January 23, 2012",1,Never Again This is a horrible service! I booked a flight through Kayak Connect and received an email from Kayak telling me that I can message them if the itinerary from Frontier airlines was different from what I ordered. 
1214,Predicativist,"October 29, 2012",5,"Highly polished and incredibly useful This is one of the best apps on the iPhone. Well designed, fast, polished, and very, very useful if you travel a lot. If only all my service oriented apps were this good. The specific airport info you get with the Pro version is great. Worth paying a little extra for."
1215,Militarycoastie2009,"April 2, 2013",5,Super easy and in app! This is the easiest and quickest fare finder that I have used! Unlike other apps this one doesn't make you leave the app and go to the website to search for fares like expedia's does. Highly recommended! I won't use any other search engine for my flights now!
1216,Dukie4,"February 10, 2015",1,"Packing list stealth removal was way uncool Let me join the angry hoards in complaining about the loss of the packing list feature, which I appreciate that Kayak clearly didn't value, but I really did. It was the most differentiating feature of this app and now I'll probably delete it altogether, because if you haven't heard... Kayak and other travel sites show iPhone users slightly higher prices because they are on average in a more affluent demographic. So use your computer (in anonymous mode) to book travel instead."
1217,Rhatman,"April 26, 2016",5,"Still the best If I'm booking on my phone it's either an absolute emergency or just browsing at a getaway, either way Kayak is the best. Just the idea of Doing the former on Expedia makes me cringe. "
1218,SG Golf Edge,"July 25, 2016",5,"Best prices I used another travel app almost exclusively until I tried it to compare a flight search.  I was really surprised at the difference in both price and flight options,  "
1219,CribbageIcon,"December 23, 2016",5,"Completely Accessible I am blind and use this app to book all my flights. I have been using it for years, and it only gets better with time. Currently, I am in Southeast Asia and have booked all the flights for a cited friend and myself with complete confidence and success. Kudos to the developers!"
1220,RUBIO,"December 22, 2015",5,"A must for the avid traveler This is now my go to app for making my travel arrangements, especially enjoy the +/- days feature, and the option to also search nearby airports at the same time. Really makes finding flights a breeze."
1221,JWAXR,"January 5, 2016",5,Great tool to control travel! I travel frequently and enjoy being able to have all my travel plans accumulated and presented in one place.  The best I have found in what it does. Additionally it helps me quickly view alternative flight and car rental data.
1222,Zzpdx,"January 20, 2016",5,"Reliable and Easy to Use We have used Kayak for years, particularly when we lived overseas and had complex multi country trips.   It is easy to set sort parameters and then work out layovers and odd hour departures.  Now we are back in USA and still use it for our less complicated interstate trips."
1223,rivendell630,"March 2, 2016",5,"Great app for travel alerts I use this app to keep track of fares for traveling, great feature and you can pick how often it gives updates  which is nice. Haven't used it for much else but will look into the other features in the future."
1224,Mikemurag,"May 19, 2016",5,"Decent app but needs to improve! Its pretty straight forward but it doesnt give you the ""trip packages"" option like the website has. Its either flights, hotels or cars. Not sure why you can search for trip packages on the website but not the app."
1225,TDVAIL,"May 27, 2016",5,"Travel person's must have It just keeps getting better and better. Kayak has always been my choice of travel app especially to provide a quick, efficient research tool. Filters are excellent and the app is streamlined for speed."

1227,DanJPeterson,"September 28, 2016",5,Great travel planning app I use Kayak all the time to plan flights and to determine options based on timing and/or costs.  It's better than any other system I've tried and easy to filter based on the critical elements of your flight. Don't leave home without it!
1228,Vic guru,"October 20, 2016",5,"All-purpose travel app I like this app because it is one of the few flight booking apps that does multi-city trips very well. It also has excellent filtering categories. However, for simple round trip fares, some other apps may give you better results."
1229,Dannis Carro,"October 29, 2016",5,Really like the flight tracking function I got kayak pro when it was free and now switch to the add free kayak app. The flight tracking function is my favorite. It shows all the useful information like terminal gate time without any useless layout. For this I will always keep kayak app.
1230,iLokito,"December 30, 2011",4,"Handy app for the road! I prefer this app then the Hotwire app, because this app doesn't require the location service on the iPhone in order to work. Unfortunately I have Sprint and I not always have enough signal for the location service to work, but this app still helped me to find a hotel room on the hills of TN. Easy to use and it works!"
1231,SaHoppa,"March 27, 2012",5,"Excellent! So amazing on the iPad! I have used the Kayak app for iPhone and Droid devices for years now and I loved it, but the iPad one is truly awesome. It has all of the functionality of the smaller app, with these gorgeous photographs and details built into it about the hotels. I am really enjoying planning my next trip with it. Thanks Kayak!"
1232,Love kayak,"July 16, 2012",5,"Professor I thought that I will never do review, but I have to say that kayak app is do easy and helpful, I use it for all my trip planning. My favorite is the my trip feature. I don't have to look for all my receipt for business trip reimbursement anymore, it all saved and organized in MyTrip."
1233,Erinkx,"September 12, 2012",5,"Lots of great options I'm on the road at least three months of the year, and I use the Kayak app constantly. It's so nice not to have to bust out my laptop in sketchy places around the world--plus, I can track fares quickly so I can act quickly. :) The app is quick and has a great interface."
1234,Raselas,"October 9, 2012",5,Such a great productivity tool! Love this app!
1235,TDS1000,"January 6, 2013",5,"Awesome I plan a Eurotrip this year, and Kayak brings ease of use and efficiency all to one place. Of course the version on PC will give you a few things that will save you a lot of money, this is great for buying tickets on the fly! It will save me $300 than I originally planned in fact so that's why I recommend it."
1236,Mirella6714,"April 24, 2013",4,"Love it! I use this app ALL THE TIME to try to find cheap flights for travel. It's really handy and definitely helps me to conveniently check prices daily so that I'm on top of the sales. The price alerts aren't the best, but I just check it really quickly everyday because it saves my history so I can check the same flight dates every time."
1237,Cliffwood66,"July 13, 2013",4,"Awesome! I've used the Kayak app for several reservations and am quite pleased with it. Window views are not always ideal once you get to the reservation part of the process, but that seems to be an interface issue between Kayak and the many companies they deal with. If those pages were adapted to fit the frame, I would be happier."
1238,MD Buyer,"December 18, 2014",5,"Nice App! Thanks, KAYAK this app works great. I'm a loyal Delta traveler and when I was not able to find what I needed/wanted for a last minute trip, you saved the day. Delta will lose my business more often now I'm afraid. Quick and easy to navigate and a perfect way to compare what's available."
1239,Aimsgames6,"November 4, 2015",5,"This app fails constantly I love it when it works. But anytime I try to look at pictures or navigate from map to list view, it just shuts off. Then I must re-enter all my info again.  Trivago here I come.  Btw, I have an iPad so if that's the problem, well, do something about it!"
1240,JadedRaverLA,"June 18, 2009",4,"Better than most paid apps. Although the early versions were quite buggy and lacking in features, the latest version is very stable and has a great interface for finding flights. Cabin selection and filtering flights by alliance are still missing, so I can't give it 5 stars yet.  Otherwise, however, FANTASTIC tool... for free!"
1241,AlienDan,"January 11, 2011",5,"New UI is great I generally only use the flight search features.  The improved UI is excellent -- looks great, intuitive, and gets pretty much all of the website's features in touch-friendly display.  Actually, I think I prefer the iPhone app to their main website now."
1242,TheMrCecil,"September 27, 2011",5,"Excellent App Just like it's webiste, this is an excellent and useful App to have. In fact it is easier to use than the website. I am looking forward to getting the iPad version when it comes out."
1243,Chromium54,"February 16, 2016",5,"Still one of the best travel apps out there Kayak is a very good aggregator of travel info and offers. I've used it for air, hotel, and car rentals many times. It's not perfect, but most errors come from the source of the info, not the app itself. Definitely a must have for me."
1244,NELLYjizzle,"August 2, 2016",1,"Inaccurate/ Outdated Airfare Was looking for flight prices to Mexico for a few weeks and prices were holding steady via Kayak (fluctuated via airline website), so I decided to book. Turns out Kayak was just displaying old prices and not searching current flights. When I tried to book a flight, it said was no longer available and directed me to airline site where it was much more expensive. I'll try other travel search sites or book direct through airline over Kayak."
1245,Looloooolooo,"September 7, 2016",5,Great trip manager I use this all the time. Easy to forward itinerary and it creates a trip. The mobile app is not as flexible as full version so I still do a few things on full web site. But using it on a trip to keep track of everything is great
1246,amariquit,"January 8, 2017",5,"Can't imagine planning travel without it! Have used the app from day one and wouldn't think to plan on any type of travel without it. App has many useful tools, but I do find myself gravitating to the full website when researching travel packages."
1247,Nickname_31,"April 14, 2017",3,"Improve the ""explore"" feature I like the idea of the explore search, the ""where can I fly for $300?"" sort of thing. However, the ability to refine the search is not enough. "
1248,Azuride,"May 23, 2017",5,"Seems pretty good I'll be honest here, I've never actually travelled anywhere before. I just use this app to look at prices so I can daydream about flying somewhere on vacation. "
1249,RayrayMaymay,"June 4, 2017",5,"Go to travel App I will research and book online through many sources just because I enjoy the planning, but I always come back to Kayak to get my comparisons. Frequently, they offer the best rates, especially if you use the alerts.  The convenience is outstanding."
1250,sublimelobc,"November 20, 2010",5,Just gets better and better The only update I really would like is to be able to update trips within the app like on the website. (for when you make a change in your trip like many of us do frequently)
1251,headsmd,"December 2, 2011",5,"Kayak rocks! I have to join the rest of the App Store community in singing Kayak's praises.  A lifesaver for the frequent traveler--couldn't be simpler to use, and really keeps my trips organized.  Also, first rate customer service: I had a question and received an e-mail the same day with a solution to my problem."
1252,Markaoo,"February 14, 2012",5,"Great app to simplify travel. It's great to be able to go to ""My Trips"" and have your entire itinerary with confirmation, flight numbers, etc in one location even if booked through various travel sites.   I recently traveled with 2 co-workers who had apps for numerous airlines, hotels and rental agencies...what a pain. This app is great!"
1253,Barbelll,"April 1, 2012",5,"Fantastic app. Very well done. I needed to make a trip to dc for a college, so I downloaded kayak. The beautiful interface was extremely easy to navigate and I got the lowest prices easily. The trip went great, and I'll be using kayak again soon. I highly advise it for any trip you might have."
1254,Mariposa59,"May 13, 2012",4,"Great Love Kayak and its options are the reason I use their website over others, but the app could use some tweaking such as adding arrival date for long time zone crossing international flights. I agree about the flex date options, would like to see more of that on here too. Otherwise...quick and easy to navigate!"
1255,VLC3,"June 6, 2012",1,"Beware costly glitches I was searching round-trip flights and pushed the back button to change the return date. This app had a glitch where even though the search showed the new date, the flight details showed the previous date. I didn't notice this and booked my flight for the wrong dates, just assuming that everything was right. My mistake for not checking thoroughly, but it was the app that caused this. Ended up having to pay $325 to change my flights!!"
1256,AUTiger09,"July 1, 2012",5,"Great travel app! Very intuitive and easy to use, and full of information for flights across all the major airlines. Especially like the +/- 1 day and price alert features in the flight search! Makes perfect sense of all the confusing individual airline sites."
1257,Kyito80,"November 4, 2013",5,"Kayak Review From what I've read I feel blessed to have had no problems with this app. I have been using it a lot the past month and haven't experienced the issues other users have. This app is very intuitive, easy to use and I'd recommend it to anyone."
1258,DEL-J,"May 27, 2014",5,"Only app that could find a rental car for me. For some reason, every app and website I tried until this one would return no results for a rental car in my area. Whatever the problem is, this app didn't have it. It allowed me to get what I needed."
1259,The Faj,"May 14, 2015",5,Stale development--inaccurate times!! This app is neglected. Don't trust the times at all--you'll either miss a flight or show up hours too early. This app consistently screws up with daylight saving time and different time zones. Such a basic fundamental thing that cuts all usefulness of this app.
1260,Krysy85,"June 9, 2015",5,Making travel plans on the run is super easy!! I love this app. I work in a department where there are a ton of rules on Internet use but I travel so often that I have to constantly check on flights. This app makes it easy for me to make my plans and keep my job lol.
1261,Dannidavinchi,"January 22, 2016",5,Wow ok so all the good reviews are true I'm in love with this app ! Thought it would be too good to be true at first but it's actually really good. I think out of all the rate comparisons sites kayak is the most on point. And it also has where you can track the price as it changes. I like it so far
1262,scooterdog_2,"August 8, 2016",5,"A 'go-to' travel shopping site and app This app offers just about all the great tools you can find on the website, including shopping for airfares by loyalty programs, plus/minus number of days, and a gauge of buying confidence that the price will rise in the future."
1263,A very grateful girl,"August 10, 2016",1,"Horrible customer service if you have a problem with reservation Made a reservation, flight was cancelled. "
1264,Scampura,"October 1, 2016",5,"My favorite app I used Tripit for years to manage my trips but converted to Kayak a few months ago. So much better. Just as good at correctly understanding forwarded emails, and the interface is a thousand times better. And the alerts are great too! Can't live without it."
1265,cbgb0426,"November 16, 2016",5,Love Kayak! Kayak is very user friendly and intuitive. I love the ability to forward my booking confirmations to a generic email address and have the app aggregate them into my trip itinerary. Really easy to search for all of your travel needs to find the best option.
1266,Spelling PoPo,"January 25, 2017",5,Great Travel App Love the way I can create price alerts for multiple trips! And the prices are always spot on! I'm giving it 4 stars instead bcuz I currently have 3-saved trips and tried saving a 4th trip but it will not save. Bummer if it only allows you to save only 3trips at a time.
1267,ScooterCap,"March 5, 2017",3,"Explore settings update - choosing amount In the explore settings on the mobile app, please change the ($ amount) option from a slide scroller to either plugging in a specific amount or choosing options i.e. $100 $150 $200 $250 and so on. It is too difficult to control with the slide scroller and can be frustrating. Other than that, the app has been a good experience."
1268,Laven1220,"April 22, 2017",5,"For Flying only I use this app only to find cheap flights. So, my only complaint is that the app seems to default to Hotel deals automatically and I find it difficult to figure out how to get it to the Flight deals page. Otherwise, It's a great app."
1269,GissC,"May 13, 2017",5,Really easy to use So far Kayak has worked out great for me. I really see the lowest fares available for the trips I plan and it lets me create alerts so I can see how prices fluctuate depending on the date I want to travel. I can always see the best dates to travel with this option!
1270,DGBaum,"October 5, 2011",5,"Awesome Love the price alert features, which alert you when a fare drops to a certain price point, or gives you a list of the cheapest flights to or from a certain location. Best app for finding last minute cheap flights. Highly recommended."
1271,Mrs.SassyD21,"January 20, 2012",4,SassyD221 Awesome app! The first time I used it my husband and I got delayed on the Tarmac I knew before the crew made announcements how long we were going to have to wait. When we ended up having to switch planes I knew what was going on. Thank you all so much for this app. Please make it easier for us to update flight info from other itineraries.
1272,ryan.n.savage,"April 1, 2012",5,"Wonderful Travel App! This is an extremely productive and useful app. I use it every time I travel, and book many hotels, cars, and flights through this app. It also has many useful info about airports, baggage, and additional fees. I highly recommend this app!"
1273,Russiangoddess,"December 8, 2012",5,Great App. This app is user friendly and very convenient. Kayak has always been my favorite comprehensive flight search website. I was able to find a flight for under $100 at the time and date I wanted in less than ten minutes.
1274,Mike flyer,"December 16, 2012",5,"Kayak Very good app, generally consistent with their website. The app has a problem with the filters, which are excellent on the website. However, on the app, the flight time filters do not appear to work. This could be likely fixed by their programmer."
1275,David Fernandez,"July 8, 2013",5,Very useful It adapts to your needs and gives you the cheapest price according to your necessities. It even compares prices with other travel sites and Is actually truthful about it because I've seen once or twice a cheaper rate at another website through kayak.
1276,JaxonEh,"July 9, 2014",5,"Fast and simple KAYAK has gotten it right.  Just the way an APP should function.  Prices from various sources appear, bracketing the real costs of flights, keeping your options clear.  Love it and use it a lot for planning and for purchasing of flights all over the world."
1277,Snoozykins,"March 9, 2015",5,"Love it This app is really helpful when trying to compare different sites. It makes it easy to have it all together.  Also, there is a notification part that allows you to add hotels or flights to watch for prices increased or decreased.  Love this feature!"
1278,rebolloa,"February 20, 2017",5,"Best search engine Kayak is the best search engine I have found for flights, without a doubt. It is easy to use and offers the best prices as compared to other search engines. Online, the flexible dates option is also quite useful."
1279,StephanyHill,"July 30, 2017",5,"Great for THIS travel beginner! I'm just starting to get my travel on and Kayak has been an excellent one-stop-shop. I'm able to find whatever it is I need whether that be a hotel, a flight, a rental car or any combination of the three. I've used Kayak EXCLUSIVELY for the last two trips!"
1280,Bjay0815,"June 12, 2013",4,"Kayak Does the Trick Easy to use and efficient. When I first downloaded it, I compared rates online and they consistently gave the same rates. Give or take maybe 10 bucks. I highly recommend for when you ate trying to find a good deal. You can keep checking until the price goes down. Very convenient."
1281,T.bob,"December 28, 2015",5,"GREAT as a flight tracker I only use the flight tracker section of this app, really, since I don't fly all that much... and it's awesome! Look up flights by arrival time and other random minimal bits of info -- esp good for tracking when you don't have flight number or exact itinerary."
1282,TekieTom,"January 12, 2016",5,Happy User I have used the Kayak app for multiple years and it gets better and more user friendly with each release. I really like the current integration of all the function versus in the past where there were separate apps needed.
1283,Anonymous-76,"May 4, 2016",3,"Website is better I usually search the Packages option on the website, which is not offered on the app. It's great for individual pieces of trips but not when trying to combine all those to compare total costs. (The mobile website drops the mapping feature in Packages, so you can't see where hotels are in relation to where you want to be/go.)"
1284,Fvisma26,"May 28, 2016",5,"Nice and always improving!! Always able to find the best prices, and love the idea that with the app I am able to see the same as on a computer and save the stuff that I see and track it when the prices change!!"
1285,KarenEQmiller,"June 18, 2016",5,Great App! I use it to book all my flights now!
1286,seanpaulaustin,"July 3, 2016",5,Notifications that work What is better than typing in a search and have that be updated to you when it changes? It takes the guesswork out of finding flights!
1287,KyllerDyller,"July 12, 2016",5,"MY Default booking site. I travel all over the US. I sometimes get a break from work to jet home for a weekend. This is my instant Go To app to get home. No fuss or hustles. Just pick what I need, select my flights and BAM... Book it. Works great and have been using it for the passed 3 years. "
1288,Arsloan,"September 2, 2016",5,"Love this app! I use this app to watch for great deals on flights. I track close to 40 different flights, and it notifies me right when a fare drops. Thanks to Kayak I'm able to snag cheap flights and we can travel as a family to great places!  Don't know how I'd plan travel without this app."
1289,Rvgadley,"November 19, 2016",5,"Very useful app You don't get a travel app because it's wonderful or beautiful, you get it because it's useful and easy to use."
1290,Marishka12345,"September 10, 2009",5,GREAT APP!!! I found this app to be very useful and convenient. It's very user-friendly and does almost everything I wanted it to do. One thing missing from this app is the email to a friend option. It would be great if that was included....please add that option . Otherwise I'm very impressed!
1291,Traye Mattingly,"May 30, 2012",4,Better Than a Travel Agent I generally don't review apps but it asked me to so I will. This app is great! My travel adviser actually called me and said she was sorry but the Kayak vacation I planned was better than what she could do. Highly recommend for travelers. Only 4 stars because you can't package a trip together like Trip Adviser. Other than that it's flawless.
1292,mrj327,"September 26, 2012",5,"Easy to use info and options for flights. Easy to use. Planned 2 recent trips to vegas y nyc with ease. I don't quite understand how2 set-up and use the ""my flights"" option. Wish there was a help button to explain. Overall, fantastic App recommended by apple store "
1293,iPhone 5☺,"December 2, 2012",5,Desperate need to get away This app not only helped me get the best flight prices but also the hotel prices. Came home for the holidays and as many know family time can get uncomfortable so I need a much sooner flight back to New York and a hotel for the next two nights in Chicago.
1294,Sami&Simba,"March 16, 2013",5,Quick and Efficient This app is fantastic! I can quickly search out different flight options and change the filter to better match my needs. Thanks to the team that created an app that works for me while I'm on the go!
1295,Shimrra,"May 24, 2016",1,"Disappointed with this app Tried to look up a package deal that was on the website but no option was there. Not a fan of basic layout I ended just going to the website on the computer to look up flight and hotel information. Also looking up Kayak site on my iPad doesn't work either, every time I went to hit a link that offered up a deal the link just never end opened properly. Overall I'm going to skip using Kayak for some time."
1296,Owner of homes,"June 16, 2016",5,"Convenient and reliable A good way to find available flights, although better prices are sometimes available directly from the airlines. I don't use it for cars and hotels often enough to rate those capabilities."
1297,Joelywoley1994,"September 11, 2016",5,"Keeps me updated! Kayak is a great website and the app is awesome too. It keeps me updated on flights I'm looking at and let's me know when it's cheapest to buy. When you live in the states and your family is in Australia, cheap flights mean a lot so thank you for helping me out Kayak :)"
1298,GSlapshot,"January 11, 2017",5,Must Have Travel App Kayak is a must have travel app for trip planning and flight searches. It allows push notifications when prices change so you don't have to worry about missing a price change or sale.
1299,Castlehillinn,"March 10, 2017",4,"No trains I can't give them the full 5 as they don't do trains or busses. If they did then I bet they would get a lot more eyes on app, since those two types are really hard to find on your own. For what the app does now it does do a five star service. Easy to use, great UI and so easy to make changes in your search."
1300,TravelingSeibels,"November 8, 2012",5,Awesome App The filtering and sorting tools make comparing travel options a breeze. We use it mostly for hotels and the ability to book through several websites without leaving the app (built in browser function) adds to the convenience.
1301,bigran82,"January 22, 2013",5,"Excellent App, Easy to Use! Been messing around with the Kayak app for a couple weeks now. Went through a whole booking process just now with no issues. Very easy to use. Clean interface. Download it for your upcoming trip if you need a flight!"
1302,Charley_Wray,"March 31, 2013",5,Airfare go-to I have only used it for airfare; so far it has worked great!! It's nice to see all the different airline prices in one place! Easy and fast. Would highly recommend to others!!!
1303,moon dancer,"May 27, 2013",5,Love Kayak!! My mans Dad only has maybe a few days if that to live and we needed something fast and at a good price. We looked at 15 other sites and after much frustration I found this app for my phone. Amazing deals Way better then any other site! Thank you kayak!!!!
1304,clay_vickers,"June 24, 2013",5,Latest updates have been a big improvement Enjoying the customisable notifications. The app itself is beautifully designed and always helps find great deals! Also love the multiple currency support.
1305,Diego Fjord,"April 3, 2015",4,Good experience for flights I fly about 3 to 5 times a year from an international airport to a regional airport and I have always found agreeable prices with Kayak. 
1306,vosco_,"July 10, 2015",4,"Great way to search for hotels and flights This is a great way to search across multiple sites at once for hotels and flights. The layout is good and easy access. One thing I wish is to be able to read the full reviews without being taken to the hotel website. Great app, very useful"
1307,MoAppleStuff,"January 1, 2016",5,"My go-to travel site I've used KAYAK as my go-to source for flights, hotels, car rental - anything and everything. It's very easy to use and makes comparison shopping simple. I use both the desktop version and the app and they are both fantastic."
1308,Braiding one,"January 1, 2016",5,"Well-done, Kayak! I have to say this App is extremely user-friendly... There is not a single thing I wish it did better... I generally prefer websites to Apps, but Kayak somehow worked out what an App should be able to do so much better than others. Thank you!"
1309,Mjr1224,"May 18, 2016",1,"New update is junk Just updated the app and it is horrible. Fares are not showing up as they did before. I was following a fare for the last few days. I updated the app and that fare no longer shows. I checked a competitor site and it was there. When I emailed kayak with my problem and a screenshot of the fare, they blew me off and told me to use the competitor site (I saved the email chain for proof). They were not interested in why their site is not working correctly after the update."
1310,CP2N,"July 12, 2009",5,"Finally! This is great! I've been waiting for this app for a while now. And it's even better than I expected! Sure, there's always room for improvement, but I travel a lot and this app makes finding my flight or hotel so quick and easy! Great job. Great app!"
1311,srhelmick,"September 2, 2009",4,S'aright Kayak is much better than those other ones ( I'm lookin at you Shatner ). And yes it has crashed once or twice but I suspect all the people giving this app one star really just need to turn their phone off every now and then to free up memory. Personally I think the Internet is just as slow as the app too so no gripe there from me.
1312,C Love,"February 11, 2010",5,"My favorite travel app Very easy to use app, maybe even more so than the web based version. Quickly & easily let's you check many airlines prices, routes, travel times & more. Hotels are easy to find with the use my location feature."
1313,Sabrina-c,"August 19, 2011",5,"Great app! Although I don't quite understand how and why, I found the ticket in this app in better time and price than in the computer when I ran the two kayak at the same time. I chose to buy that iphone-only ticket and it's fast and easy. Unbelievable app!"
1314,Bfltsnik,"September 12, 2011",5,"Fantastic! Convenient, easy to use, full of helpful information! Favorite thing is being able to add trips by simply forwarding my confirmation email. I can even sync all the trips to my google calendar with a few clicks. Great app, highly recommend to anyone!"
1315,Travel-Alot,"November 30, 2011",4,Kayak app Great app... Buying is not always the easiest and sometime the currency slips back to pound rather than dollar or which ever currency I am currently working with.  Bottom line it's the best travel app I have come across and gives you an idea of prices and is the best thing to have if your on the run and need to grab a last minute flight.
1316,Redhotgamer,"April 21, 2012",5,Awesome Best app ever for a vacation list and more i mean it is just perfect it has everything you need to go to a vacation and be ready to leave with everything you need and tells when you should leave and when this app is perfect to have a vacation.
1317,Jmssa5,"May 25, 2012",5,"Excellent app...with a couple of shortcomins I use this app extensively. However, it seems buggy when editing trips. It won't let me change flight times or other items. Also, would be helpful to add itineraries not necessarily purchased on the app."
1318,Pengwino,"June 27, 2012",2,"Terribly annoying The ""current location"" feature does not pick up Charlotte, NC. As another reviewer mentioned regarding Dallas, this is a major hub. The search feature for airport destinations also doesn't work. I typed in my destination and the wheel kept spinning but didn't pull up anything. Seems the location feature is terrible overall. "

1322,Kj12408,"June 3, 2015",5,"Easy to Use & Best Deals Kayak is the easiest to use out of all the travel apps. It always has the best deals and the most search options. For example, you can search multi-city flights and cars which you can't do on most travel apps."
1323,surfagrl,"January 12, 2016",5,Much better than the website I find this app indispensable for quickly checking prices on flights to plan trips. Large selection of hotels in most cities I've used it for. Definitely one of my most used apps!
1324,Scrotal Lip,"February 27, 2016",5,"My best private app I love this product. There can be some improvements (in the app, the options at the header are not always obvious) but this is my most active app I use for personal reasons. "

We don't always have a destination in mind, and for the right airfare are happy to ""try a place out"". Great option, easy to use and see, and includes international."
1327,Junior4doe,"September 1, 2016",5,"Customer I've been using Kayak since 2008. Bit is still the best flight search engine.  If I had to make a change, it would be to incorporate all airlines and not just the selected few.  I notice that Southwest Airlines is not part of the search."
1328,Nonnss,"February 9, 2017",5,"😍 Thank you Kayak! Not only is this first place I go every time I'm searching for flights, but when you're at the airport and your flight's been canceled you can use the Kayak app to search for flights the booking specialist has overlooked. On my way home!"
1329,DK Betas,"March 6, 2017",5,"Nice...a couple of suggestions By far, the best consolidated travel site! I have been a user for years. Thanks for making it easy and useful w/o any garbage on the screen. I do NOT like the filters though--I don't care for the symbols. "
1330,Mark_Denver,"January 22, 2012",4,"Great comparison tool, easy to use I can always find who is offering the best price on flights for my travel needs using KAYAK.  Rental cars are not as easy since most sites have special deals if you click on certain links only from their site.  I did like KAYAK HD better, it was more intuitive and easier to navigate."
1331,xWEJx,"June 3, 2012",5,"Great Website, Great App I love Kayak, and its app is just as great! Very intuitive and touch-screen friendly interface. Sometimes when passing over to the airlines' sites, your search can be lost. But I blame the incompetent airlines ;) This app makes the nightmare of navigating complex airfare scheduling a snap. Highly recommended!"
1332,Hieudz,"January 19, 2013",5,"Price alert crashed When set lowest fare in price alert, it always show ""no data was found for this alert! Refresh your alert or try it later/tmr"". It has been like this for 2 weeks and looks like no one at kayak care about this issue!"

I always search kayak website first when I'm on a computer, and now that I have the app, it is the first place I search for travel deals when I'm on my phone.  I have not found any drawbacks to this app."
1334,Jkinyon,"January 22, 2016",5,"Great Travel Tool I've used Kayak for several years now and it really helps to plan my cross-country trips.  The only thing missing is Southwest that doesn't participate, but I can go to their website and make a comparison. If you're flying, this is a great place to start."
1335,theEclecticGeek,"February 21, 2016",5,Useful and convenient. Esp for tracking. Very useful and convenient. Sometimes better than the desktop site for searching fares. But does not get latest status for some airlines sometimes. I saw that with American Airlines. The aa app had more accurate info.
1336,ANGIE TEACH,"February 27, 2016",5,"Mama's watching Both my sons, who are in their 40's travel a great deal. Much of it is international. This gives me something do do as I worry.

1337,Tdubzhere,"May 10, 2016",4,"Safe and easy Enjoy using this app because it works really well and it intuitive. One of its other great features is the notifications when your flight has been delayed, gate changed and the advanced warning that it's time to check in to get the best seats possible."
1338,Sleepgrrl,"October 27, 2016",4,Works great I am from the USA but live in Costa Rica. I absolutely love the flight alerts. They help me know when the best deals are available to travel and see friends. I have a flexible schedule most of the time and can book when it's cheapest with this app. It works great. It does occasionally freeze up but other than that I love it.
1339,Brady Morrison,"March 4, 2017",4,Golden standard for travel search app The app is great overall. But their re-design recently wastes a lot of screen space. Many users would like to find a flight they like and screenshot the result. So much space is wasted in displaying the information that it doesn't fit even on my iPhone 6s screen.
1340,classical-guitar,"December 10, 2011",5,"How could you not love this app? This app is amazing. It is incredibly versatile. I'm live tracking my gfs flight right now so I can get to the airport on time. It is incredibly useful whether you are the one flying or not. Even if you travel once a year, this app should be on your iPhone."
1341,Bettyultrera,"April 24, 2012",5,"Easy to use, time saving, awesome app I love using this app to search, find, and book the best deals. Can easily compare prices and I love using the Buzz feature to find when the cheapest time of year or of the month to fly.  Booking your flights and hotels is simple."
1342,DisneylandsFan,"July 22, 2012",5,Very well rounded and easy to pick up to use This app is very easy to figure out and use without much thought. I wis it had an option to search for B&Bs - maybe in another version... This would also be a must-have for any business traveller or salesman!
1343,AJ in AK,"January 24, 2013",5,"Price alerts no longer working As another reviewer mentioned, when set to 'find lowest fare', the price alert says no data found and to try again later- been this way since the last 'upgrade'. Please fix, kayak!"

1346,Scudder in Honolulu,"June 5, 2013",3,Inaccurate fares The feature that allows one to find fares to anywhere in the world using certain filters (desired travel months etc.) will find a teaser fare then disappear one click later.  The actual fares are nowhere close to what is displayed.  This is a HUGE bug and needs to be repaired.  It makes one wonder how many other programming mistakes are in this software.
1347,HNLliving,"November 17, 2014",5,Fantastic APP I can't tell you how much I rely on this APP. I travel frequently for work and KAYAK always gives me the best price. I often check other sites just to confirm the low prices and they're true. Don't even think twice about using KAYAK when traveling. It's the best.
1348,Spamalam,"April 30, 2015",5,Flight and hotel booked here every time! I love to travel and the Kayak app makes searching for the cheapest flight and beat hotel so easy for me! The information is always at my finger tips and ready when I need it. I don't know what I would do without Kayak!

1350,Dbystrit,"October 1, 2009",3,"The icon did it... I don't really travel much, although this app would seem useful to keep on a just-in-case basis. I'm extremely OCD about the icon's dimensions looking awkward compared to the other apps which actually follow standards, so I deleted this. They should probably realize that iPhone owners like their screens neat and well designed, and seriously, as ridiculous as it sounds, the icon was the dealbreaker."
1351,estaples,"January 2, 2010",5,"Very polished, strong app. I loved it before the recent update, and you've taken it to another level. Way to go! I used this a few months ago to book hotel accommodations and it worked wonderfully; this will definitely remain a regular for me."
1352,UsMetriX,"November 16, 2010",4,"A nice way to check flight prices Works well most of the time, crashes here and there. I use it to get a sense of pricing, but always book with a travel agent, as everyone should. My travel agent can usually beat any price, but even if their price is the same, plus commission, it's well worth it (as any frequent flyer knows)."
1353,Diggest,"August 28, 2011",4,"Kayak ap This is a great ap, but if you search a flight for 2 or more passengers, the price you are shown is for 1 passenger. Why don't they total the cost? This is also the case for a hotel stay that is for more than 1 night. If you get a hotel quote for 10 nights, it doesn't quote the total. It only displays the price per night."
1354,vspiars,"November 16, 2011",4,"Great app for traveling the world Aside from having difficulty with changing the origin location I have found the ""Explore"" feature to so wonderful. My wife and I get to travel as often as we used to but it allows us to keep our option open and see what is available to try."

1356,5280Pete,"January 12, 2017",5,Informative I like the app because it's fairly easy to navigate. It runs slow at times because it's searching a ton of sites. It does however give me the lowest price available 85% of the time. That alone makes it worth a lot to me.

1359,ChristmasCheer8,"June 18, 2017",4,Useful The trips feature read all the itinerary emails correctly. However it resulted in multiple trips being created and the app has no way to merge them. Fortunately the website does otherwise this review would be lower. Kayak has an excellent hotel database which gives it an edge over TripIt.
1360,KauaiSkyGuy,"July 18, 2012",5,"App is even better than the website! This is a 1-stop shop for airline tickets! I downloaded and used the other guys' apps too, and after a month of comparison, Kayak always wins - hands down! And the app is so pretty and smooth and fast. I give it 👍👍."
1361,Worth one dollar,"October 9, 2012",3,"Results are awful Everytime I pick the lowest priced flight, it sends me to the 3rd party site and says ""flight no longer available at this price, it's now 1200 (basically 300 more).

1363,Wired.,"November 24, 2013",5,Better than the web version Love this app. It's always accurate. I like the auto fill feature for buying on the fly. Better than the web version with all the open windows. The app is simpler and more effective.
1364,Sabretel,"December 11, 2014",5,Best designed app I have seen and I have seen a lot I work with apps on a daily basis mainly for business efficiency. This is probably one of the slickest travel apps I have come across really well-designed. If you fly at all you owe it to yourself to take a look at this one.
1365,Peaches2012vvvvvv,"December 26, 2015",5,Great App I've been using this app for a few years. I use the price tracker to watch prices. The sort and refine search features are very comprehensive. I always use it to find the flight and price I want then go directly to the airline to book.

1368,MIA in Miami,"January 13, 2016",5,"Saved the day. After a frustrating run around with a large airline that rhymes with spamerican Schmairlines, I went on to kayak to see what flights they had immediately. I found a flight a third of the cost for the Change with Spamerican."

I love this app. You just forward your confirmation email to an e-mail address, and it sorts everything out and then keeps all the info you need while traveling in one convenient place, and sends you reminder e-mails when you need them, without making it feel like spam."
1372,gcsnj,"February 2, 2012",1,"awful new version The previous version of this app was truly awesome, with superb sorting capabilities and flexibility.  When I tried to use it this morning the old app said it was being phased out and no longer supported, and linked to this version.  What a nightmare -- the user interface is clunkier than the old version, and some sorting functions seem to have been eliminated.  Basically, I find this new version woefully inadequate, and truly worthless.  I am deleting it as soon as I submit this review."

1383,Sasqch,"January 2, 2014",5,My go to travel app This is the app I go to first for checking out hotels airfares cars etc. One thing I would love to see in the application is the ability to save hotels that I may be interested in without actually booking. Please add that function.

I saved the screenshots.  Kayak took 2 hours away from our family sunday."
1396,Benzo187,"April 26, 2017",5,Kayak never fails!!! I love to travel and kayak always makes sure I am well taken care of.  The fact that kayak doesn't know me personally and still takes care of me is the definition of customer service.  Thank you all for what you do!

1402,Crownline 245,"January 22, 2016",5,Best travel app; liked the old format better Kayak is my go to travel app - i love it.  Only complaint is that the new format seems less intuitive.  Harder to quickly change parameters like number of stops and time frames.
1403,Jazzygirl72,"June 30, 2016",5,"Customized searches and alerts You can set up multiple searches and alerts. Then it directs you to the actual airline's site for purchase, which is nice. I don't use third party sites for buying airfare. Too many issues if you need help."
1404,J-Deck,"September 24, 2016",1,"Inability to filter out Just Fly I have been unable to find a way to get rid of ""Just Fly"" promotions makes this app somewhat unusable for me. All my alerts quote what amounts to usually 100s of dollars less because of their promotions. The BBB warns against them and regardless of the legitimacy of the submitted complaints, it wouldn't be something I trust. The point of kayak for me is to find the deals. When you take out just fly, the offers are far less tempting. I feel a bait and switch here."

1407,Ronniesp61,"January 28, 2017",4,"It's the best I have found so far. Once I figured out that the doh icky with the three knobs let me enter search parameters, it was easier to use.

1408,Lipseys1,"March 2, 2017",5,Great Notifications I have several notifications set up that I use for frequent trips and I always feel like I'm getting the best deal through Kayak. It also helps me to know when to avoid flying because of price increases.

One of the best features is that they include taxes & fees so you are always comparing apples to apples.  Also their charts are great showing three days before & after a specified date.
1417,Noah Horowitz,"May 8, 2014",3,"Doesn't remember last search I love kayak and often use this app.  However, since the last update, when I open the app to search, the last search is not there to just redo.  Need to enter all info all over again.  Liked how it was all there before, and you could change or re-enter if you wanted."
1418,Nika Wattinen,"March 29, 2015",4,"Doesn't work I've always been a massive buyer of Kayak, and was an early adopter and contributor, suggesting the ability to filter by stopover airports. I love Kayak as a tool and a company, which is why I can only deduct one star. But this app version is useless. Literally. It doesn't work. It doesn't search and no results appear. Please fix it"
1419,menyuamos,"January 17, 2016",5,"Best!!! Kayak always helps me find the best deals and flight options that are usually never on other sites! Definitely my number one place to go to when I want to look for flights or a getaway weekend, I always know I can rely on Kayak!!"
1420,Tukuman,"August 26, 2009",5,"Great app!!! So much easier to use then the actual site if you are flexible and just want to catch a good deal!!! I wish there'd be one including cheaptix and cheapoair... Great job!!! For me it works really fast even on Edge network. Crashes rarely, not more often then any other app."
1421,CheckwDavid,"May 14, 2010",5,Excellent Latest update is the best on-stop flight search out there. One minor bug: upgrade button tells you price of Pro version is $0.99 then takes you to app store where it's actually $1.99. Fix to avoid bait/stitch accusations.
1422,Santoleri3,"May 1, 2011",5,"Great app Just finished a multi-city car trip, with hotel stays in multiple locations.  Kayak helped with reservations, and the ease of adding the itinerary just by forwarding confirmation emails is awesome.  Had used the flight tracker earlier, which was spot on for flights at CVG.  Definitely upgrading!"
1423,fRace06,"December 14, 2011",5,"Great!! Thanks to this app, I'm able to check for delays and plan ahead for rides etc. one time I was about to head to the airport and saw my flight had a 3 hour delay, so I was able to stay home a little longer and eat. Must have for frequent flyers!"
1424,RrrRRmmMMMm,"February 7, 2012",3,Bug report Flight tracker stopped working after the last update. Shows up only for the first flight in any itinerary - disappears if you scroll down then up. Alerts don't seem to be working any more either.
1425,JoeHaus,"March 11, 2012",5,Great app Interface is a snap.  It is well developed for flight searches which is all I use it for.  It is much quicker than searching via the computer.  Only gripe is I cannot find how to re-activate push notifications after declining upon install...  Great app!!
1426,Katniss33,"November 8, 2016",5,"So far, so great! I've only used Kayak for a short time to plan two trips, but my experience so far has been spectacular. I like how I can easily see the various legs of flights and the ability to secure ground transportation and lodging all in one place."
1427,Lktamer,"March 15, 2017",5,Mobile app possibly better than the website Love kayak. They're the first place I go when booking flights for my company. We have a lot of complicated tickets that sometimes the airlines won't even show you. Great tool.
1428,DeeBeeBeMe,"April 23, 2017",5,"Money Saver Before this user-friendly Kayak app, one had to buy a thick expensive book to find detailed flight information like this. How great it is now to search for a flight, find it and make reservations all in one satisfying motion.   Thank you, Kayak. "
1429,graemeearly,"July 16, 2017",3,"never thought i'd write one of these recently the app underwent a huge design refresh that sadly ruined it both functionally and made it less pleasant to use. it regularly errors out now even performing routine tasks. i used to be a big kayak enthusiast but this experience is making it hard to recommend the app and site. Why Kayak why!?? :( Signed, Formerly Happy User"
1430,rodriguezsergio,"December 30, 2011",5,"Better than the website As other reviewers have pointed out, the app is really user-friendly and works really well. It is such a good app, that I don't bother turning on my laptop sometimes and just browse flights from my iPhone."
1431,Akidya3en,"January 27, 2012",5,"Outstanding app I never write reviews for apps, but I had to for this one. Kayak is user friendly and easy to you, and has all the travel information you may need. I booked flights and hotels on it and never had an issue."
1432,PPnDaPark,"February 21, 2012",5,"Great resource !!! Best travel site I've ever used, and the app is just as great.  Good navigation, excellent use of screen space, clear and simple interface and options.  Makes it easy to check all the travel prices as often as you want."
1433,h2plushalfo2,"April 3, 2012",5,Gr8 travel app One of the best ways to find a flight. Always use it first before checking a couple of other sites and buying. Never fails to disappoint. Better than the web version and as fast.
1434,CS14USAFA2011,"June 24, 2012",4,Great Product For Mobile Fantastic. Excellent user interface. Would only be better if you could pick one leg from one option for your departure flight and another leg from another option for your return flight like on the website.
1435,umLA,"October 10, 2012",5,Most efficient travel app! All of the other airline & travel booking apps don't compare to Kayak's. I can choose Muti-city when booking flights (NONE of the competing apps did this!) This app keeps it simple but has every feature you need!
1436,JenBus7,"February 12, 2013",3,"Ugh Great for searching prices, but if you use the app to go to airlines site and purchase, you can't use back browser if you click on a link. You lose all progress and have to start over again. I tried twice already to purchase a ticket and I am still unsure if the transaction went through. Frustrating"
1437,MrToad1138,"October 3, 2014",4,"Great app to search airlines bad to pay for tickets Great app to search flights, when using app to book and pay for tickets it brings you to the airline full web site.... Impossible to navigate, because it wasn't an airline mobile page.. Caused me to get blocked by the airline..."
1438,Never Surrender Never Give Up,"December 29, 2015",5,"Great, but not Perfect I use Kayak for a lot of my trips.  It's fast and easy.  I did have some trouble making multiple reservations at the same hotel without having to exit and go back in...  It didn't seem intuitive..."
1439,Parkhopper317,"October 6, 2016",5,Easiest way to search for travel Love this web site an app. Easy to find the most options for flying. It doesn't always meet my need for the way I want to search but it's better than all the others!
1440,Gronkthecromagnon,"November 5, 2010",5,Impressive This app just keeps getting better and better with frequent updates and new features. I actually think it's better than the desktop version. Well worth the download.
1441,Troigrl,"August 22, 2013",5,Great to Have I used this app only once to book a flight and all worked well. The biggest benefit has been the ability to look up and flights need from my future travel plans.
1442,IamMukMartian,"February 7, 2015",5,"Great travel app I love this app. Between the price alert and the exploring rates map, there isn't much missing. Everyone seems mad about some packing list but seriously be an adult and know what to pack already. Used it to plan a ton of great local and international trips."
1443,Myfaith178,"February 8, 2016",4,Appreciate the explorer app and price prediction Ok I can't expect Kayak to predict prices to a T but I regret using Kayak's travel purchase guide for a local flight from LA to SF for NYE plans.
1444,Aaronhamburg,"September 7, 2016",5,"Excellent As a frequent traveler I use this app all the time to check for flights, hotels, and rental cars. It is always accurate, never crashes, and allows me to tinker with settings like airline alliances and departure/arrival times to get the best deal. Highly recommended!"
1445,cben,"November 10, 2016",5,Brilliant app Great for tracking your bookings and managing itinerary. The flight search functions and alerts very helpful. This is really a must have. The only thing that is not so great is the cost of changing flights if you book through KAYAK. Strongly recommend!
1446,ggvictoria,"November 16, 2016",5,My Go-To Flight Search Kayak has been my go-to flight search for various years now. I can always rely on it showing me the best deals based on a huge variety of search options I get to choose from.
1447,talya3,"December 21, 2016",5,Easy and fun I am trying to plan a trip with my gf so I am comparing kayak's flight prices based on her school calendar and when she'll be working. This app works wonderfully and allows me to easily use different features to find what I'm looking for
1448,Lastplacevictory,"January 8, 2017",5,One and Only Kayak is the only website I use to check all the different flights available. Now it's even simpler for me to do this with the app on my phone! I've found a reasonably priced flight on Kayak for my trip to MI in March and I'm super excited!
1449,mmrbluewater,"January 25, 2017",5,Great travel app! My favorite travel app.  Period.  Until Google flights is made into an app I'll keep using Kayak to search flights- it's the best user interface and allows for searching complex multi destination itineraries which I do often.  Great app.
1450,jmerrow,"March 20, 2012",5,Fastest flight checker on the planet This is simply the fastest way to find all available flights between where you are at and where you want to go. All flights. All fares. All seats. This is the app you want when you get stuck at the airport.
1451,Going to nowhere traveler,"April 21, 2012",4,"Well put together app Simple to use, and fast.  Calendars that are laid out well, and a clean results page make finding flights quick and easy.  Going back to change search parameters are a snap since all criteria are remembered when going back the search page."
1452,DollarDidIt,"July 2, 2012",4,"Thanks for an easy app!! Like that it compares, has an easy way to check but would like if you could see what was before or after the town or exit you were specifically checking since we are driving almost 9 hrs to Disney and are considering staying halfway."
1453,--MO--,"July 11, 2012",3,"Could be MUCH improved!! This app should get 2 1/2 stars but that wasnt an option. It is helpful but when trying to book flights it becomes overly repetitive when having to type in the same info over and over again. It's a decent app, but it is less user friendly then others out there."
1454,M6479,"September 3, 2012",3,"Needs some fixing For example, when searching for cars with automatic transmission- with option selected in app- still yields results with manual transmission. Generally the app is not sufficient for my needs and I end up going to the website. Wish the two were fully in sync with the same features and functionality."
1455,Rican J,"September 25, 2012",5,Best app for booking flights Has all the little extras to help find the cheapest best flight in one search. Not every site has the option to search nearby airports and flexible dates at your fingertips. You are provided with so many options. Its great.
1456,Anthropikos,"January 19, 2013",4,"Convenient Most of the information I need in one place. One thing I would like to see is an explanation of what accommodations are at each hotel. If that were in the app, I would give it five stars. If it is in the app, and I just missed it somehow, I apologize for not giving it five stars at the time of this review."
1457,Lashmeade,"February 3, 2013",5,Love the sort function So far the best app I've found to quickly check flight prices. Having the ability to sort flights based on my own travel times is a bonus!
1458,68muscle,"May 4, 2013",5,"Fabulous app This is a fabulous application. Being able to email your trip details to your Kayak portfolio is an unprecedented feature. I even emailed my rental car reservation made completely outside Kayak, and - boom - there it is! Two thumbs way up!!! Get this app!"
1459,Ghdma191&$,"June 8, 2013",5,Best travel app ever!! This app delivers everything you need for a traveler on the go! I travel a lot and often at the last minute. Rarely do I find cheaper flights or hotels with other websites or apps. I mostly use it internationally and within the South Pacific.
1460,bpbenda,"December 23, 2009",4,"Please Add Multi-City Flight Search Love Kayak, love the app, but please add multi-city flight search (which your website offers and does a great job of). Should not be all that difficult to implement as this app already offers one-way lookups. Will go to 5-star for me when this is added. Thanks and please keep up the excellent work!"
1461,HamsterPup,"August 23, 2010",5,"Perfect for what it is This is a fantastic app. I love the clean and easy to use layout, but mostly I live that I can book a flight directly from my phone and that it stores the info for the flight so it's super easy to find. Plus, it's free so great all around."
1462,"Stupid app, needs fixes","September 25, 2010",3,"Bad prices!!! Good concept, but the prices are never the lowest ones. Even when it refers you to orbits prices, if you go to the websites they always have different prices. Travelocity orbits and chepoair have much lower prices. Please fix. Would love to purchase tickets from app but way too expensive. Last flight I looked up was $200 higher than Travelocity!!! Please fix!"
1463,ThisNameIsAlreadyTaken1,"October 16, 2010",4,"Simple, easy and helpfull Is quicker and easier to use than the web. The carry on pack list and and other tools are a friendly touch. Could be better if you could apply trip packages (car, hotel, flight,) instead of doing them separate"
1464,Artofzen,"August 15, 2011",3,"Don't like my trips download Excellent app, long time user. Was not happy with the new version update to My Trips. I cannot view my trips without a data/wi-fi connection which is not always possible when traveling internationally and that is the time when I need to see my itinerary the most. Will give 5 stars if this goes back to how it was earlier."
1465,Why did you change it,"January 14, 2012",1,New flights list very confusing The new flight list gives you 500 flights to choose except when you take time to look at them all they seem to really be the same 3 or 4 flights different only by the intermediate stops. A real waste of time and effort compared to the old app.  The slider bar for departure and arrival times was much better than the new check box categories.  Bring back the old app or I'm looking for another service.
1466,LaLaLizeth,"January 31, 2012",5,"Convenient and manageable As a travel assistant for many, to be able to have my own in the palm of my hand for personal travel is great! "

1468,Mlemly,"February 21, 2017",5,"Can't live without it Flights, cars, hotels- I seriously don't know how I would function without this app. Perfect functionality, reliably best deals for any travel need. Love the ease of booking and purchasing directly through the app."
1469,Rick520,"March 5, 2017",5,Outstanding! I love this app.  It's a great place to start and always tells me when planning my next trip.  The way it checked prices across multiple airlines works well for me. The filters are great and I love the various sort options.
1470,Envinyanta,"December 15, 2013",2,"Kayak service is good, but app has issues Kayak as a whole is great, but their app has some bugs that make the experience frustrating. Aside from vague details when looking at hotel rooms the form and booking page cuts off the right-side of the screen, hiding important information. After trying repeatedly to book a room I decided on using another service and app instead."
1471,Robstoppable,"January 5, 2014",5,"Great and streamlined. Works perfectly on an iPhone 5s with iOS 7.0.4. Shows all flight times, layovers, and it's easy to find the cheapest price for your airfare. Before checkout it shows pricing on other travel sites. I fully recommend this."
1472,Hotpepperjam,"January 14, 2014",5,"Easy efficient Best app for frequent travelers and hopeful travelers. Can set up alerts for price drops, can make trips flexible to get the best prices. I find this app very useful and efficient so I don't have to search the internet on multiple sites. This does that for you."
1473,jalopez0926,"January 8, 2016",4,"Love Kayak I love using the app Kayak. The price alerts is my favorite feature. However, I do wish it priced cheapest flights with multiple airlines even if one is prominent. Also, wish it showed Southwest fares as well. Otherwise, this is the app I use for most of my searches with flights, hotel, and car rental."
1474,Jayline87,"January 20, 2016",5,My go-to app for finding flights I've been using kayak for years to find flights so of course I downloaded the app. The app makes it even easier to search for flights or hotels. I'd recommend it to anyone.
1475,Purpleequalsseventh,"March 1, 2016",5,Nothing but good deals! This app has helped me find many many many low fares! I love the ability to program and alert certain flights! Give this a try! I don't think you will
1476,SoccerNutCase,"May 30, 2016",5,"First class app and great deals The app works well on my iPhone 6. It is pretty well formatted and fits the screen well. I also like the fact that there are sometimes ""mobile only"" deals that I get for my car rental searches."
1477,Amrzen,"August 8, 2016",5,Amazing Kayak is the most accurate and better prices the any other websites anyone could use to purchase an international flight tickets. I have been using kayak for the past 7 years and I got now issues.
1478,Alicia M.H.,"August 19, 2016",5,My fav travel site I can't count how many times i've used kayak.  It's so user friendly. I absolutely love that I can set up alerts to watch flight prices.  I've rented a car before for a week that was the cost of daily rental!  Thanks kayak!
1479,Wizinit,"August 30, 2016",5,"Go-Tp Travel App I start my research for travel, to compare airlines, rental cars or hotels on Kayak.  I may actually switch to my air, corporate care or hotel reward sites to get my miles or enjoy preferred status, but Kayak is where I can quickly determine the best options."
1480,Rxuser,"October 2, 2009",3,"Works well when not crashing I have been using this app to search for flights and it has not let me down until today, when I really needed it, and it updated via the app store to v1.6.  Crashes every time I search for a flight now.  Hopefully the developer will either pull v1.6 or release an update soon to fix this."
1481,KR/Disney,"November 9, 2011",5,Perfect Planning Perfect app for planning. Filter and sort are very useful and no other traveling app has this option as in depth.

1486,zurak87,"May 26, 2013",5,First thing I use when planning a trip Essential to every trip that I have booked for over 5 years.  I use it for its ease and comprehensive search tools. I send friends and relatives to website all the time. I can't live without it.
1487,Mr Kilian,"September 20, 2013",1,Garbage--Get Hipmunk I travel almost weekly for work and use lots of travel apps. I used Kayak after not using it for a while. I usually use Hipmunk. Kayak is now chuck full of ads that are intermingled with search results making it frustrating and cumbersome to quickly look through results. I deleted it and will stick with Hipmunk. This is an app focused on suckering you into unwanted options rather than just giving you what you want and need. Very poor design.
1488,Hhhwtf,"September 27, 2013",4,"Cannot view how far hotels are from city anymore Before the update the hotels would show how far away they were from the city you were looking in. The font is too big and doesn't display that pertinent information anymore. Please fix, and it's a 5 star app."

1490,bewdymate,"November 26, 2016",5,"Excellent! Great app for checking flight/hotel pricing, but also excellent at keeping your itinerary and tracking your flights - it provides real-time gate/departure/arrival information as good if not better than any other app out there."
1491,GQForeverRed,"December 30, 2016",5,"Best Way To Book Flights! I only use Kayak to view my flight options, booking is easy as well. Pricing includes tax and any other fees. The price you see is what you get unless you add on accommodations such as first class seating, insurance etc."
1492,aircraftgray,"January 6, 2017",5,"Perfect design and functionality On the occasion I need to book or track a flight, I'm always impressed with this apps design. A top notch team must have worked long and hard to create this; it's an excellent app. Logical and beautiful."
1493,seaner97,"January 16, 2017",4,"Could be improved The price alerts don't allow you to track a specific flight or set that have times that are best for you. If the cheapest ticket goes up or down, it changes your pricing. In practice, I've got to go check them daily anyway."
1494,Chk251,"February 10, 2017",4,"Great way to find the best deals I travel a lot, and it is ALWAYS on a budget and with little to no planning. I usually resort to sleeping in my car, but now I can snooze in a real bed thanks to Kayak! This app saves me so much money, trouble, and grief. When I use Kayak, I know I'm getting the best deal possible at a decent hotel. I love this app!"
1495,Msladylawyer26,"February 12, 2017",2,Website ended up being cheaper for the same flight. I downloaded the app thinking there would be cheaper flights. The flight I booked cost $100 more than in the app. I booked online. Make sure you compare them. The difference in price for the exact same flight was ridiculous. Just make sure you check the website and compare.
1496,DandyDinosaurDoug,"February 28, 2017",5,Great app This is the app where I begin my search for routes and airfares. There are other apps that review all published airfares but this one is reliable and comprehensive. It is also easy to navigate and make changes during the initial planning phase of a trip.
1497,Jetstream59,"February 28, 2017",5,"Excellent App One flaw I see is that when you ask it to include surrounding airports on a round trip, it then let's you unselect certain departure airports on the trip out, but does not let you in select departure airports on the return. Other than that, it's great!"
1498,Kellytoos,"March 24, 2017",5,"Best travel arrangement app By far the easiest to use and most useful app when booking flights, hotels, etc. Gives you many sorting options and filters to get exactly what you want and quickly."
1499,StowBlood,"March 24, 2017",5,Love the savings! I like the explore feature in this app!  Works well.  Would like to be able to put in city without dates though and easily decipher the cheapest flight.  I have flexible time off and this would be helpful.
1500,CowboySteve99,"January 29, 2016",5,"Kayak for cars I use Kayak mainly for rentals, always get better prices than using the rental car apps. It's quick and easy, I don't have to open each app to see prices- all of them are already listed. "
1501,Shanakin27,"February 15, 2016",5,"Great tool for rate shopping While I don't always book through KAYAK, I ALWAYS use it to find out which airline has the best rates. The app is great for figuring out options for flights. The search function is very robust, and I like the filtering options."

1505,John 54901,"August 23, 2016",5,"Helpful an easy to use Gives you a quick snap shot and easy to use.   Obviously, you might want to compare fares, but it certainly points you in the right direction most often."
1506,wildchilly,"August 31, 2016",5,Lifesaver Kayak really makes it easy to find the cheapest flights and set up price alerts to make sure you get the best price. It's helped me multiple times on finding flights and saving at least 30% if not more.
1507,re-sister,"October 1, 2016",5,"Great way to start mapping out flight options I travel a ton for work and fun, and this is the first app I go to for mapping out flight options. I love the multi-city, one-way options and numerous filters to narrow down flights to exactly what I need."

1510,bebopfunksta,"May 21, 2012",5,"All In One App, Practical Checked the prices of hotel rooms on Expedia and this app has competitive prices as relative to that site.

1511,butiban,"October 2, 2012",5,Great App Must have this app in your iPhone ! amazing well design and very easy to navigate through. It has every thing you need from booking flights to even a check list for what to take with you in your journey.
1512,JonnyDub,"May 9, 2013",5,Very helpful I've used this app for planning many trips so far and it's saved me a LOT of money and headaches. Definitely worth the download even if just to look at prices (it shows the best deal whether they have it or not)
1513,ocutitta,"January 5, 2014",2,"Terrible one way vs round trip organization When you choose the round trip option it makes it confusing and discombobulating to book a trip, it only gives you the one way option instead of the complete round trip view like on the website...

1514,LaThames,"March 30, 2014",5,"Nice Upgrade Very nice upgrade done... I find it much easier to check the flights. Although, it seems that it could be much better selection with the flights. Other than that, pretty cool, very accessible app ☺️"
1515,Samurai Penguin 80,"July 19, 2014",5,A great app! My girlfriend and I enjoy getting a room from time to time just to break out of the norm and this app helps us do just that.  It helps us find rooms at a much more affordable rate which allows us to enjoy other things as well.
1516,Madmax-como,"October 11, 2014",5,"Used to be great... Wow, what happened?  There isn't a history any more and the price alerts are hard to set up.  I guess I need to find a different app for this function.  I travel a lot and want to watch prices, but this is a pain."
1517,Jon Igitol,"December 26, 2014",5,"Must use App for your travel needs! I use this app all the time for my travel. Great and simple user interface, quick and current pricing and comparisons. Book travel and accommodations right in the app. What more do you need?"
1518,ojayuk,"January 31, 2015",1,"Packing list gone! Do not update your app if you liked the packing list feature. I got a major surprise yesterday after finding it gone - and just as I was packing for a work trip. I sent an email to Kayak and they confirmed its removal, with no explanation given. Why do this? It was a genuinely useful side-feature if this app, and now my personalised packing lists (which I spent time improving) have vanished. I will change this review to a five star rating once it is reinstated."
1519,AndrewMazey,"January 25, 2016",5,My favorite flight app I'm a frequent flyer and this is by far my favorite flight app. Great for checking flight options across all airlines and comparing times and prices. I often book flights directly from the app too.
1520,usaczar,"August 22, 2009",5,Works Perfectly! Amazing app that removes the multiple layers of work when trying to find the best fares.  Love the trend button that lets you see where the best fares are heading. 
1521,Thequeenaunt,"February 11, 2010",5,GREAT. I am not a huge fan of the website so I was somewhat hesitant on the app but it was free so....... it!!! I found an airport nearby that I never even thought to use. This is a must have FREE app if you plan yo book any flights or just looking to plan a trip! Saved me $100 off the bat!
1522,coolscdude,"July 23, 2010",5,"From a user's standpoint . . . this app is great. Like all apps, I could criticise this one to death over minor details but I wont. Thats because its helped me find TONS of options - FAST!  A sort by price option for hotels would be nice but it works well even without it."
1523,Keith Rob,"October 15, 2010",5,"Great app Use their website all the time to find cheap flights.  Their app is almost as functional working with a lot less real estate, and I was just looking for a flight departure/arrival app when I realize that this Kayak app give me that info too."
1524,a37ka,"November 6, 2010",5,"Incredible Very impressive app, very useful, and very practical. You have everything at your fingertip. From hotel to flight, from car rental to baggage check, and even tracking your flight. This app is a must have."
1525,RMM84,"May 23, 2011",5,Easier to use Had the app on my phone and used it quit often. Then tried using kayak on my computer. This app was 100 times easier to navigate through than the website!! Love this app!
1526,Piotrisimo,"January 13, 2012",5,"95% there A must-have to shop for travel, but results should be double checked, especially when traveling between ""exotic"" countries. Cheaper prices might be available on their website, directly."
1527,joeyhorner22,"January 18, 2012",5,"Version 2 is good! I had the first version, but it never worked well and would lose my place when switching back and forth between apps. This version is great! A much improved UI and experience!"
1528,JO2.0,"March 31, 2012",5,"Awesome! Easy to use. Great user interface. Kayak gives a good price comparison between other competitors, no need to search else where. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a seamless searching and booking process."
1529,313 Cell,"May 10, 2012",5,Awesome This app hands down smokes any other travel app out there. Customer service is kind and courteous and if you have any problems they will definitely resolve the issue. This app needs to be a part of anyone lives who enjoys traveling.

1531,B+ App,"February 22, 2015",5,"Works like a charm Every time I start plan a trip this is now my first step. When I first downloaded it I tried comparing my results to other sites and from what I saw, the results from those sites are shown accurately on this app."
1532,Cal4niatropics,"December 26, 2015",5,"Good stuff!!! You guys are amazing, and I appreciate cutting out all the ""BS"" such as finding fairs where there's 20 taxes and fees on top of the ticket price, as you guys calculate all that for us to show us the literal total cost. Now if only we can get Allegiant (rip off airline) shut down :)"
1533,kimbunnykay,"February 27, 2016",5,"Easy to use Super easy to use. My go-to app for vacations, business flights, car rental, and hotel accommodations. Sometimes I will use another app, but usually only because an airline doesn't participate with programs like Kayak."
1534,NCwsj reader,"March 16, 2016",5,Great travel app for on the go planning Always able to access flight and hotel information for last minute trips when they come up
1535,RealStefke,"August 5, 2016",5,"Multiple ways to search and user friendly Like all the options, filters, +/- days and sorting. Haven't missed anything, haven't had any issues and app is user friendly"
1536,Jackson Creations,"September 8, 2016",5,Great deals on flights!!!! Great job for providing us really good deals. What I enjoy the most is I'm able to save a flight that I see and come back later to purchase. The price my fluctuate a little bit but still great deals.
1537,Online introvert,"September 17, 2016",5,"Great app! App is a great way to find affordable flights. The interface is user-friendly and highly intuitive. Love the ""Explore"" feature that lets you find deals all over the world from your outbound destination."
1538,Vyika,"July 6, 2017",5,Calendar feature not working The most recent update makes the calendar function impossible to use and the app crashes continuously.
1539,GeoffSJG,"August 23, 2017",4,"Crashes after update: fixed UPDATE: Deleting and reinstalling the app, after seeing this suggested by the official Kayak Twitter, seems to have solved the problem."
1540,GC123!,"January 2, 2012",4,"Great, easy to use, fast and intuitive The app is easy to navigate and provides a lot of options for changing your plans to get a lower price. The only thing I would like to see is a calendar matrix that shows me how the prices change if I go a day forward or backward!"
1541,Oz in Naples,"June 27, 2012",5,Great tool I use this app for business more than anything and at times for personal. 
1542,RadioSinger,"July 10, 2012",5,"My go-to app for all travel research This app is super user-friendly and helpful. Whenever I'm contemplating travel, I use it to check prices. I've even booked flights using it, instead of my computer. They make it easy and fun!"
1543,Kelliejc,"August 22, 2012",5,"Awesome! I was planning a trip to Europe and was using Expedia, I am so glad I downloaded this app and looked here, the prices for ALL of the cities I was looking at were less than half the cost! Now l'll be able to enjoy my trip knowing I got the best deal possible!"
1544,chillbolt,"August 29, 2012",5,The Best Flight Search tool It's the industry standard for a reason: it's the best. All the airlines plus all the surrounding airports within the flexible date range you are thinking of traveling makes for the easiest way to book your flight.
1545,Petehall,"September 27, 2012",5,"Awesome travel app It just works, easy to use and very quick. I always come away impressed and its more than just finding flights, also stores my trip itinerary and keeps all my confirmations together. Great, useful app."
1546,Ram201201,"January 3, 2013",5,"Very good Excellent app, easy to use. Best thing is  showing all the prices available from other sites too. "
1547,Just Sayin'!!!,"March 24, 2013",5,First time Kayak user ......and I love it! Won't be using Expedia anymore. And you can't even book an international flight with Delta Mobile which is inconvenient!! Love Kayak! Especially the price reminder. Lets just hope they notify me of an awesome deal to Cancun!!!
1548,Reviewed by Dave,"April 30, 2013",1,"Buggy and painful -- problems with seniors The app does not allow up front to select a senior but catches it later after all information is entered. Then, unfortunately it blanks out information when it assists you to fix and you have to enter it all over again. Then you find out the data has to be refreshed and lose information again. Then it tells you the flight is no longer available."
1549,Miilliie123321,"May 15, 2013",5,"Best of them all!! Has the most in depth info compared to all the travel search apps. I have all of them and kayak has the best info, although it does not give a ""buy"" or ""do not buy"" advice on the mobile version."
1550,OCDMedic,"December 14, 2009",4,Only missing one thing I wish they would add a feature where you can look for a flight/car/hotel package. If they add that I will give it 5 stars. Other than that I love this app. Very easy to use. I've not had any crashing problems. I can't believe this app is free.
1551,Chern.Hwang,"October 26, 2010",4,"Simple, very useful I built my trip information in the kayak site, then it shows in the iPhone.  The information is well organized and displayed.   Suggestion: 1. Need revision function in the iPhone version. 2. New function for entering the expense during the travel.  "
1552,GinaMarie_GG,"August 26, 2011",5,Best flight finder I've ever used! I do a lot of personal travel and this is by far the BEST flight finder I've ever used! The awesome sorting & filtering options and easy-to-use format are features that you don't see anywhere else. I recommend it to everyone I know!
1553,Remoh Cuz,"September 15, 2011",5,"Terrific After searching several sites for cross-country airfares, I put Kayak on my iPhone just to see how it compared. Kayak found the cheapest flight, & with min flight changes & layovers, so I booked the ticket on the spot...all from my iphone while relaxing on the lanai. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1554,RexxMonster,"October 5, 2011",5,Really good! My Mother in law recommended this app and I am so glad that I got it! We are planning a trip to Hawaii and I hope this app will help us even more! Totally recommend this! I especially like how it gives you what orbitz or another company's prices on hotels. Vey useful. Get it!
1555,Scottn1323,"March 27, 2017",5,Add something for us please Love the app. It would however be helpful if we had the option to fly into one city and find a hotel or return flight in another nearby city! What do you think?
1556,Groverlee,"March 29, 2017",5,Most reliable travel prices I always know that I'm getting the lowest fare & that the amount shown is with taxes/fees/etc already included so there isn't a price jump when you go to book it.
1557,Oni_m,"June 8, 2017",5,My favorite app It's a really good app with all my needs met it can forecast prices which is super useful and the options are almost endless I take my budgeting for traveling seriously for this app helps me work the the details.

It is painful enough that I am writing this review..."
1560,ProfeshTraveler,"December 21, 2015",5,"Best travel app out there The only app I use to book all my private and business travels. Always find the best deals with my preferred airlines.

1561,97Keys,"January 4, 2016",5,"Great features! I fly frequently and Kayak Alerts are great for my business budget. I get updated on all three trips I am making between March and June, with notifications on my iPad, iPhone, and iMac when flights are more affordable."
1562,biff_henderson,"June 1, 2016",5,"my go to travel app I am not a very frequent flyer, maybe two or three times a year. After playing around with the other apps, this one turned me into a kayak'r- now it is my single source and continues to be"
1563,gabejimenez319,"June 6, 2016",4,Great App!!! I use for all my traveling needs. Has great filters to really get what you want. And an integrated map feature that gives you an idea of where you're located and where you're destinations are. I've stopped using Priceline because this is actually better.
1564,Shuya_Seouls,"June 13, 2016",5,"Love what I see so far can't wait to book my first flight I was recommended by a friend who travels constantly and so far, this site/app really does what it Saids and I can't wait to book my first flight once I have the collected funds lol"
1565,Espyw,"July 21, 2016",5,Never book without Kayak All of my travel reservations begin with a quick search on Kayak. I travel extensively on business and frequently on vacation and have found Kayak searches to be absolutely indespensible.
1566,Brittany0000001,"August 16, 2016",5,"Love the app My favorite part about the app are the price alerts I can set. When I know I have travel coming up, and I can fly into one of any 4 airports, I use the alerts to keep an eye on where I can get the best deal! This is my favorite airfare app!"
1567,Fdizzle6,"September 26, 2016",5,"The best This is the only app to use when booking travel- not only it is fast and simple to book, you can also set notifications on particulars flights- this helps you get the best price!"
1568,Stats Lewis,"November 6, 2016",5,Kayak...the best! I have used several sites to plan my travel over the years.  Kayak consistently provides an easy to use format.  We really appreciate the price alert option to help determine the best time to purchase airfare.  Thanks...
1569,acford,"March 1, 2017",5,Excellent This is the coolest travel app out there. I like how you can email your trip confirmations to kayak and have it automatically create your trip itinerary. It alerts me for my flights and all other important aspects of my trip. No-brainer!
1570,Minkymink,"July 15, 2012",5,Kayak is very handy and helpful Helps me find great prices and makes finding hotels a breeze wherever I may be traveling. I recommend this app to any business person or anyone who wants to make travel or vacationing easier
1571,Ericpoo,"July 23, 2012",5,"Easier than actual Internet site.., I use this app constantly. It is quick and easy. If you just want information or if you want to go as far as purchasing your tickets this app is a great performer."
1572,Sagu000777,"October 20, 2012",4,Simple and cool. Intl airfare alert glitches Love the app and the UI. Slick and simple and clear. 
1573,DeepakMohan,"November 14, 2012",5,Way and accurate app I am very new to air ticket bookings. This app helps me to easily book my tickets. The result navigation and look and feel of the app is highly professional. One stop shop for every traveler. Main thing is this app is free ;-)
1574,Qassimm92,"April 19, 2013",5,Comfort and easy to use The only missing thing is the monthly price show to tell you what is the cheaper date. Other than that the app is excellent and comfortable to use because it's stylish and basic
1575,Lion-O24,"April 27, 2013",5,User Friendly This is the easiest travel app I have ever used. It's much easier to find what I need when planning a trip than going to a myriad of different sites. I really like how it includes applicable taxes and fees with the hotel's room rate.
1576,KO172,"January 24, 2014",5,"Great App! Great app! I use it for all my traveling needs. Whether to check on a flight, find my gate (if it's not listed on my ticket), set reminders on things to pack, set notification on flights, etc. overall very happy with it!"
1577,Goldylox19,"September 24, 2014",5,"Love it!! Expedia is extraordinarily efficient, and it's easy to compare prices from flights to hotels. Planning a business trip or a vacation could not be easier. Takes away one less thing to stress about!"

1580,St. Aiden,"September 1, 2011",5,Best Travel App Out There! Simply the best.  The only downside is that I have to use the mobile site (even at my desk) to follow a flight.  Otherwise the flight tracking is better than my own airline's on-line reservation site!!
1581,Caseyg1,"January 15, 2012",5,Mr I've been looking for a travel site that would give me All destinations from a specific airport for years. The new Kayak does that and give you fares too!
1582,Boronas,"March 19, 2012",4,"Promising Never have really trusted these ""all-inclusive"" sites that search in all airlines for me, but so far Kayak seems promising. Will be able to give 5 stars when I actually book a trip, so for now this is it :-). Will continue using and maybe will soon provide a better review."
1583,Finn2375,"June 19, 2012",4,Good app; history does not delete I use app quite a bit and is very useful. I have recent problem though. I can't delete my history of flight searches. All previous searches are still present. This never happened before. Please check this.
1584,Joelle108,"July 12, 2012",3,"Car rental search needs work When searching for car rentals, the results do not indicate the details of the car.

Time waster...."
1585,randommac3,"January 3, 2017",5,"Great way to start and finish a reservation I like Kayak's layout and tools better than any other method of booking travel. It's fast and reliable, and easy to fine tune your results. And the flight tracker is invaluable."

1588,Ripwalk2,"July 14, 2017",5,New layout is MUCH better! I love this app for storing my trips. Have used it for many years. A couple years ago I did a personal comparison using 3 other trip apps. Kayak was the best! And I love the new layout - great improvement. Thank you !
1589,Infreq flyer,"July 25, 2017",5,"Great searches, find the deals Long a favorite of mine, Kayak meta search has come through for me time and again when I travel on a budget. Now in app form- it's intuitive and flexible. I use it for flight and hotels."

1594,LaTisha.tv,"March 2, 2016",5,Tells me when my flight is delayed before airline does The kayak app is on it. I get a notification when my flight is delayed or canceled before the airline even calls me. Now I can sleep in.
1595,Jerra,"March 3, 2016",5,"Very useful for travelers Very useful for keeping track of flight ticket price, trip research, and pricing alerts. I've used it for years, and l like the constant improvement being added with each upgrade."

1598,Warriors1306,"October 21, 2016",5,Favorites? Wish you were able to tag Favorites in the flight tracking so you didn't have to keep typing in each time.
1599,Greg9292,"November 22, 2016",5,"Great app  standard for the travel dreamer I generally do not leave reviews for the same reasons most people don't. I am lazy. Kayak app is my exception, they have done a great job with this app encompassing all tools to find dream trips or a business trip you need."
1600,Howardhudson,"December 6, 2010",5,Attorney This app is every bit as functional as the browser-based one. I completed a purchase started with Kayak Mobile and zero problems.  Getting to keep various routes and days helped immensely in trip planning. 
1601,Amwardwell,"August 30, 2011",5,Clean App The use of this app is clean and smooth. Excellent high quality photos of each hotel. I am not much of a review reader when it comes to hotels but I found some very helpful feedback. Now I know where not to go for the holidays. Thanks Kayak.
1602,crniaugust,"September 1, 2011",5,"works better than Delta's internal search engine I could not believe that Kayak was able to find particular round trip for 1300 USD while Delta's web site was giving me 1800 USD for same dates, same origination, same destination!"
1603,lukehejl,"September 1, 2011",5,Kayak rocks This is the best travel app I've ever used. Found and booked a hotel in another country in minutes. Also found the absolute best deal for this hotel in a matter of min. Kayak knows what's up for the busy no-nonsense type that wants the best deal.
1604,Tstrieter32,"November 25, 2011",5,Very useful We were on a road trip..... Had no clue where a reasonable hotel/motel was. We were able to look and book within 15 min.  Called the place to verify - everything worked out perfectly.  Love it.
1605,Jebs Shell,"April 28, 2012",5,Smashing Great app. It has everything you need and even things you didn't think you did but once you see them you realize how helpful they can be. Very user friendly and aesthetically designed.
1606,Mrs.Heath,"May 3, 2012",5,Love!!!! I am a military wife and we move A LOT! So being able to see more than one flight at a time is nice. I wish they had a way to limit the layover time! Who wants to spend 6 hours at some airport...;) other than that def a great app!
1607,Unhappycustomer948531680,"June 12, 2012",1,False Advertising!!!! I tried booking a flight for a certain price when I clicked it redirected me and the price was almost double what kayak was offering. That is awful!!! If you can't offer it at that price then don't advertise it for that price!!!! That's false advertising!!! I tried calling customer service and you can't get ahold of anyone unless you have their extension!!! Talk about a bad company!! False advertising and can't talk to anyone??? How do they stay in business???

1609,SoundDove,"January 3, 2016",5,"Handy Travel App I've used Kayak for years before on the web and as an app on my former Blackberry smart phone, and now with iPhone. The interface is easy to use and I would recommend it to others."
1610,technojerry,"November 12, 2010",5,Great App Kayak app is my first choice for searching for airfares and other travel choices. I have this app on both my iPhone and the iPad. It is even better on the iPad with the larger screen. Screen layout and search options work great.

1612,Chris in Chicago 2016,"September 30, 2016",5,"5 for data access Great app to access information. It's a great tool to help plan your vacation and figure out options. Yes, the booking process is faulty. Yes, Kayak subcontracts. But overall it's a great TOOL to guide your planning skills. Love the explorer feature- great for flexible schedules."
1613,CA Catgirl,"January 17, 2017",5,"Great way to find flights This is my go to app for booking work trips. I love being able to check all options and filter to my specific time constraints, etc. The price confidence rating is a nice touch!"

1619,edwhug,"July 20, 2017",5,"My go-to app for flights It's so easy and responsive to navigate and to play the what-if game. I especially like the price alert future, since I plan trips well ahead of time and can wait for a price window."
1620,Mamie1972,"December 30, 2012",5,Cuts straight to the chase This app is super… Great for the business traveler and/or planning family vacations. Cuts straight through many other confusing and ad-based travel sites and gets to the bottom line price-wise.
1621,Brittanidawn,"May 9, 2013",5,"MUST HAVE This app is simple and amazing. I just became obsessed with checking for better rates on flights... this is easy to use, multi city the whole 9, plus you can put a price watch on the ones you like. must have."
1622,Olga.2506,"June 6, 2013",5,It's ok It's a good app in general but it's missing many filters including type of travelers. It just lets you choose the number but not whether they are kids and if they are in a separate seat or on your lap etc
1623,Rob47728,"July 25, 2013",5,Great App I found this app to be the best one if you look for air fair then go back to the main menu it automatically looks up hotels for the dates and location that you check for flights.
1624,AdonisBod,"July 27, 2013",5,"Terrific results! Booked hotel accommodations for the first time today via Kayak and the platform is just so user friendly!  I was able to arrange my hotel stay at a 5-star luxury resort in Downtown Palm Springs for less than $90 p/night. Great competitive pricing - BARGAIN, I would say!! :-)"
1625,kmelendez0914,"February 11, 2014",5,Very useful for checking low prices I'm constantly checking Kayak for low price flights and flexible scheduling. I also like to see if the price of my flight went down to get refund credit.
1626,Smp888,"June 7, 2016",5,"Great for business and leisure travelers I travel every week and use Kayak all the time.  It has a great user interface that lets me select for stops, schedule, whatever.  I have found it more helpful than the alternatives"
1627,Fieldspl,"June 20, 2016",5,I use it all the time I use this app anytime I travel. It's the first place I go and I pretty much stop here. It has flights as well as hotels and cars... Why go further. I love the newer version which lets me put flights in folders... Brilliant!!!
1628,Longtime fan if BofA,"August 31, 2016",5,Helped me find a great deal Recently I was in Europe and needed to get back to the US. Kayak found a great deal on one way ticket leaving just a few days later. Would not have found it by myself otherwise. 
1629,ceyrydd,"September 21, 2016",5,My favorite travel organizer I use this at least 4-5 times each year and it serves as a shared organizer and record of my travels. It excels at parsing email sent to kayak as well as at printing for handing to family who want a paper copy of itinerary.
1630,dlm4,"August 3, 2011",5,"Awesome Loaded in the cities and almost immediately received flights almost 50% cheaper than I had found in two months of searching. Most amazing, and very efficient. Highly recommended"
1631,Madman Dave,"October 31, 2011",5,Gr8 web site taylored for smart phone I've used the web site for a couple years I find it the best for planning a trip & comparing flight pricing and now it's an application that is quick & easy to use.
1632,Hemptard,"January 3, 2012",2,"Bugs and crashes I only gave it 2 stars because I love kayak. This app is totally useless for me.  It seems to choose dates and searches on it's own, and will not let me go back.  Eventually, it just shuts off and crashes every time.  Funny because nobody else is mentioning it, but this is the first app of about 60 that I have had any problems with. Any other iPad users having this issue?"
1633,Deezee714,"February 20, 2012",5,Incredibly convenient! The kayak app makes it easy to book flights on the go. I've used it while traveling to when my plans have change and have had great results.
1634,Rutgersfan,"March 4, 2012",4,Excellent App-- The app is excellent and it does what it says. The only problem I have with it is I had difficulty placing an order for the airline I found on Kayak. the order would not go through and I had to go to the webpage from the browser and order it there.
1635,QMcknight,"May 16, 2012",5,"Great App I love this app! I was able to use it several times, but the important time was when I was planning a girls weekend out. All hotels was trying to over charge because of the holiday but using this app I was able to get a great price!"
1636,macbeth21,"May 22, 2012",5,"Perfect Idk what I did before kayak, but this app extremely helpful and easy to use! I get alerted every morning when the price goes down and it makes it easy to compare flights from different departures"
1637,Lemonroy,"July 7, 2012",3,"Sleek and elegant way to search flights This app presents flight schedules, hotel rates, and car rentals in such a way that you'll want to book it immediately. This is mainly because of its sleek design and very simple approach on navigating through its interface. However, if i were to choose between Kayak and Skyscanner, I'll definitely choose the latter."
1638,ocvagabond,"July 15, 2012",4,"Great app with one glaring omission This app is easy to use and book from. The one huge omission when compared to their full website is the lack of ""flexible"" dates feature. If this feature were ported to the app in a later release, then this would merit 5 stars."
1639,The MatherJ,"December 22, 2012",5,Nice It's perfect for someone who does a lot of traveling such as myself. It also works great with a low bandwidth connection. Doesn't need a lot to run properly. Great app and will always use no matter where i am in the world.
1640,dianasaurrus,"May 19, 2011",5,"Awesome I send all my plane itineraries and hotel bookings to this kayak app and it stores it all for me in a neat way. Now I can keep track of all my travel details and track my flights for free on my phone. It's such a great app, Replaced my tripit app with kayak and never looked back."
1641,gpspine,"August 25, 2016",5,"Great Features I really appreciate being able to send all my booking receipts to Kayak regardless of where they were booked and keep all the info in one place. The new ""Activities"" section is great for exploring new destinations."
1642,MarilynKnows,"September 27, 2016",5,Easy to use and best prices Using Kayak as my #1 resource for finding the best prices has been a huge time and money saver. It is super simple to use and I am thrilled with the prices they find. Highly recommend for the novice or seasoned traveler.
1643,Mary Jane03,"October 9, 2016",5,"My go to app! This the best app for looking for the best prices for airfares, no matter where you are going.  I travel for pleasure at least 4 times a year to CA, and twice to Europe. Using Kayak, I always know I got the best price available at the time of booking!"
1644,Psalm 150,"November 21, 2016",5,Quick and easy Quick and easy to use. I find last minute deals all the time. Great resource to shop around without going to every website.
1645,ABR3434,"November 25, 2016",2,iPad support is a joke This used to be a great app on the iPad. Now I'd rather go use my laptop than try to search anything from the couch with this app.  They've just lazily decided to use identical layouts on the iPad as on the phone so you spend all your time sliding between different views instead of being able to see and manipulate everything at once the way you used to.  Yuck.
1646,gNeeUs,"December 7, 2016",5,"Liking the app more and more every day Great feature set, very handy for planning as well as during travel, and good sharing capabilities. Looking forward to additional unexplored features... expense report integration perhaps?"
1647,megan_w/the egg sound,"January 12, 2017",5,Simple and effective I travel about 6 months a year for work. This app is great for planning a trip several months out or looking for anything day of. I recommend it to everyone.
1648,Edward Ashton,"January 20, 2017",5,"Great app! Very solid app, just as one would expect from using Kayak's excellent web-based services. Travel alerts, prices, etc.—definitely one to keep in your arsenal of travel-planning applications and services."
1649,MedicineisAmazing,"January 25, 2017",5,"One of the best booking apps! As the title implies, this is one of my favorite booking apps to use. It's easy to use and fast! I've used Kayak to book flights to New York, Boston, San Francisco, New Orleans, and have had zero issues on their end. Highly recommend!"
1650,EnchantedSassyFem,"February 2, 2016",5,Time saver I love the convenience of having the best prices all in one spot and how easy it is to book flights. I've used it for finding and booking all my flights for the last 2.5 years.
1651,TheoneStar1*,"February 15, 2016",5,Great app I've had a lot of good experiences with the app and I haven't had any issues that weren't quickly resolved. Some people aren't happy with anything so I didn't listen to the malicious reviews and I'm very glad I didn't
1652,In Bonita,"February 21, 2016",5,Great app and extremely useful One of the easiest to get info from on available flights and hotels and cars. It is always where I start looking for travel information.
1653,PorcelainGrin,"February 24, 2016",4,"Almost Flawless This app compares up-to-the-minute pricing on different airlines, even obscure ones. One thing it fails to do is warn you about pricing scams, such as half-price tickets with surprise baggage fees. I usually snag the best deals on this site, but I've also picked the lowest-seeming price and ended up worse off."
1654,Huhsjshsbzjs,"February 27, 2016",5,Always my 1st stop for airfares! Have been using Kayak for a while now and love it.  Gives you all the possible options of airlines for air booking and the filters on flight times and no of stops!
1655,Jdunph,"April 3, 2016",5,"Nice app First time Ive ever liked an app enough to write a review; easy to use, flexible settings allow you to easily compare options to get the best price. Graphs and historical data are a huge plus when analyzing what snd when yo buy."
1656,2!!,"April 3, 2016",5,Very useful This is a great app. The notifications are a huge bonus. I saved so much money during my destination wedding when flight dropped by half. I notified all my guests and we all got a great deal thx to this app.
1657,DBDcanada,"June 15, 2016",5,FFF - Find Flights Fast Great app for finding what flight options exists - whether you are looking for the cheapest options or trying to find the right flight connections. Lots of filters give you flexibility.
1658,Kernko,"June 19, 2016",5,Most useful travel app I LOVE kayak! They have the best rates. Keep all your travel plans in one place; send reminders for online check-in and notify if there's a flight change and gate details. A must have for frequent travelers!
1659,Blackie GQ,"August 4, 2016",5,"Gotta have it! If you're looking for the best flights, you need the kayak app. It has flights that Travelocity and Expedia don't. Airlines that don't post on those sites are on here and it's great!  It's easy to combine flights from different carriers as well."
1660,Kaygee12234,"May 5, 2014",5,Best and easiest Terrific travel app. I use it for flights. Simple to set up your trips and add filters to quickly see what your best prices options are.  I find it the most comprehensive and reliable of these travel apps.
1661,NuttyNaty27,"September 21, 2014",5,"This app is very handy Very easy to use, easy to change dates for optimum savings. Great way to organize your flights when choosing dates and airlines to fly with. I'll be using this app again in the future."
1662,LexieYe,"October 8, 2014",4,"It's a great product but there are some bugs It provides comprehensive info and I love using kayak website, this is a good product but the app sometimes will black the whole screen and you need to force quitting the program and reopen it again."
1663,Ndizvo,"January 13, 2015",5,Best app I've used several apps to book flights etc. Kayak has never let me down and I love the way they direct you to the most convenient and affordable rates for whatever you are looking for.
1664,Mint convert,"January 6, 2016",5,Perfect app This app collects all my travel reservations into one place.  Being able to forward itineraries to the trips section makes it a breeze to have all the information in one spot
1665,Cary Travel Gal,"January 10, 2016",5,"My App For Travel I use this app for all my travel needs...except cruises, but if they added cruises, I would use it for that too.  Easy to use, easy to make plans, easy to purchase.  Love it, recommend it to others."
1666,Cal702,"January 13, 2016",5,Awesome site This site offers round the clock reviews and cost of the flights with accurate minute to minute notifications.  Whether you are business traveler or an occasional traveler it is a help to all.   Must use!

1668,B856937154,"January 24, 2016",5,Great for travel planning on the go! The Kayak app is very easy to navigate on an iPhone and makes travel planning or last minute changes easy.  I highly recommend to frequent business travelers.
1669,tfetonti,"January 24, 2016",5,"Wanderluster I'm a travel junkie, and I find myself using this app multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. I always get fast, accurate, cost effective results and it's very user friendly to boot. Love Kayak!"
1670,Richilopochtli,"September 27, 2011",5,The best for searching flights Using this app for years and always gives me the best options and best prices! Although some small airlines are still missing it is the best tool sofar for looking for flights anywhere!
1671,DaRon'tez Williams,"November 12, 2011",5,"Yes, Awesome!! If your looking for the fast, easy, best self explained way of travel without being told by someone how to do it step by step then you'll be choosing the absolute right app!!! Think of it this way; your way of travel is all in YOUR HANDS!!!"
1672,DIIN-sama,"February 5, 2012",5,Lifetime customer Been using your service for six years and I can't find a better deal anywhere else. Thank you for being awesome and giving us an app that is just as good as the site.
1673,US in New Zealand,"February 26, 2012",5,Don't like the new version Thought the last version was much better with its three pane approach.  Bring it back as it was so much easier to use and to keep track of your recent searches!
1674,RedEyeGuy,"April 8, 2012",5,"Dynamite I am a service member stationed overseas and Kayak's services have saved my soldiers and me hundreds of dollars with their seamless and comprehensive searches and services. There are a few other European airlines I would like to see incorporated, but otherwise a fantastic service."
1675,InspiredDesigner,"April 11, 2012",4,"User friendly I like the simplicity of the app & how you can search & modify your search faster than in the desktop version. However, I miss having the option to see charts & recent deals you get in the desktop  version."
1676,Andy S B,"April 13, 2012",5,"The best by far . Andy S B Comprehensive,thorough all the info one needs,photo,prices and maps. Wished we had this app when we were traveling last summer. Oh,yes. Absolutely love your clever and insane commercials,well done you crazy guys!"
1677,woodturner1951,"June 2, 2012",3,Nothing special & needs work App needs to integrate with the website more fully. App does not often contain updates or changes.  I find that it is easier to access website through browser and keep the link on my page than use the app. Still has away to go.
1678,Jcmbbc,"December 8, 2012",5,A must have app before on the go The best app for booking flights. I love the feature that you can track the prices in a given time so that you can always find the best fare if your schedule is flexible.

1680,LA to HK!,"November 5, 2010",5,Filter layovers please?! Great app!! So many things you can do!! You guys read my mind about the flexible dates! Please add a filter to adjust layover times tho. Some flights are 12hours stuck in another country.. It'd be really nice to eliminate those if possible..Thanks!!!
1681,Chayah,"May 3, 2011",5,"Perfect Hands down my favorite travel app. It is powerful and yet simple, with innovative features that wowed me and made me think, ""Why didn't any of the other apps think of that?"" Other apps (and websites!) should have to study this app."
1682,orme kid,"June 17, 2011",5,Best travel app out there! The fact that this app is free makes it hands down the best travel app in the app store. I even chose to look up flights on my phone now instead of the computer. Must have travel app!
1683,ZeldaScotty,"August 27, 2016",5,Easy to Use and Understand The publisher makes it easy to search and understand the results. It shows well on a phone and iPad. Intuitive and smooth.
1684,Texster71,"October 3, 2016",5,Great Travel App I use Kayak whenever I am looking for quick comparisons on multiple options. I've used it on simple local hotel and extensive International bookings and have t been disappointed yet.
1685,michduran,"December 9, 2016",4,"Good app This app is nice for finding flights and being able to sort them a few ways is awesome. It would be nice if allowed users to choose flights from different airlines, for example, choose SW one way and AA on the way back, in order to get the best deal."
1686,Jdkjrhxj,"January 16, 2017",5,"Great travel site You can book your car, flight, & hotel. Just wish they added a cruise section to make it all one stop shopping from one site!"
1687,Gronkanator,"February 20, 2017",5,"Explore Great app.  Love the Explore feature, which allows you to set a budget and travel periods.  A map interface provides a view of all the flight destinations meeting your criteria served from your home airport.  Let's go!"
1688,otisbird,"May 29, 2017",5,"Very user-friendly & effective I find it really simplifies travel for me big time. I love that you can easily change, add, remove variables in the overall ""equation"" when searching. Very user friendly."

1691,"Sweet,","July 17, 2015",2,"Bait and switch This app is a huge game of bait and switch... 99% of the time you do not get the offer they display. Flights are worse than hotels, with hotels being horrible, half the time there aren't even any rooms available that they offer. On the ok, I like the hotel map stuff, jus use it to find a hotel near the place you wanna stay and call the hotel directly."
1692,Mangosele,"December 24, 2015",4,My Go to app for travel Love this app. I use it to compare airfare and as a flight tracker. Gives me up to date information when needed. I recommend it to everyone looking to book a flight and needs to search for the best price and the best itinerary.
1693,Marblefamily8,"December 29, 2015",5,"Great App.  Needs one improvement Great app.  Compares multiple deals with apparent ease.  It should, however, be able to book for more than 6 people at a time.  That is about the only failing that the app has."
1694,Pilatesmom,"January 12, 2016",5,"Easy to use I like to use Kayak when I'm beginning the various searches for an upcoming trip. It gives me an idea of airfare prices, whether to wait or not on purchases and where to look for hotels."
1695,Coo,"February 10, 2016",5,User friendly but not always the best deals I use Expedia for most of my bookings so this app allows me to do some comparison shopping. Wish I could book both flight and hotel from this app.
1696,Superstar B,"March 18, 2016",5,"Great App Great travel site... Aggregates major travel site prices and compares flights, hotels, etc to help you find the lowest prices. But know that it does not include some of the major airlines like jet blue and southwest. Long ago it did not include Virgin but now it does."
1697,bendhoward,"May 3, 2016",2,"Meh, use the desktop site The app is really just a sparse interface that's missing the features that make the desktop site useful.  I could choose between plenty of different flight booking sites, but I use Kayak because of features like the flexible date table and quick toggling of settings.  Without this in the app it really serves little purpose."
1698,Apple dissapointment,"May 28, 2016",5,"One of the best Kayak has been a leader in travel search technology since its inception! The site and app just continue to improve. Kayak is great because it allows you to book on the origination site, not their own."

1700,Kazzaa97,"December 5, 2011",5,Great travel app I travel a lot and have searched for the cheapest travel site. Sidestep would always beat Kayak even if only for $5. But then kayak bought sidestep and now I can say Kayak is hands down as good as it gets. The app works great. Fast and efficient!
1701,qwsedrftgnh,"December 29, 2011",5,Love this app! It's easy to use and I love how you can email travel plans and it's organized. I like this better than tripit. The coolest thing is if you put in your home airport it shows a picture of the world and how much airfares are!

1703,Jizzack77,"January 27, 2012",5,Super duper! Great app! One of the best apps to have for the iPhone! I think this may be the best app of all time. I would pay $70 for an app like this. I don't think that this app could be any better! This app amazes me on a daily basis and I cannot live my life without it!
1704,PC1010,"May 30, 2012",1,"Jams up your phone This huge application jams up my 16GB 3GS.  It is so large that the update won't install unless directly connected to my computer but it still tries to update and causes no end of problems on the phone.  It sometimes locks the phone from making calls, interferes with other applications and when you attempt to actually run it, it does absolutely NOTHING!.  You can't even delete the miserable thing."
1705,UnemployedJobSeeker,"June 26, 2012",5,BEST COST CUTTING APP! I never write reviews but took a moment to do so after the Kayak app saved me from spending another exuberant amount of money to stay in a city I wanted to return home from!!

1710,BWoodbridge,"September 14, 2009",3,"Kayak Flight Search I use Kayak reguarly on-line. Just tried the new iPhone app, and it searched well with similar results and no crashing the first few searches. What enhancement I really need is to save or forward search results or individual flights to those who will book them. One more star when that is added."
1711,ArtursBoy,"March 25, 2010",5,"Great App ! Surprisingly well written app, saves tons of time, it's so nice to have rates from different travel sites, and even from the hotels' own sites, all in one place. A pleasure to use, quick and easy, would definately recommend."

1715,Amosina,"November 16, 2016",5,My go-to travel app I use Kayak whenever I need flights. It's easy to use and let's you know whether to go for it or hold off for a bit until the prices come down.
1716,Necrorog,"November 27, 2016",4,"Just some fine tune-ups I think the app is awesome. It's pretty intuitive. I recommend a few tune-ups on the calendar. Like a heads up about ""tap your start date"" and then ""tap your end date"" the first few seconds were very confusing."
1717,$moki,"December 31, 2016",5,Great flight search app I only use this app for general flight searches and I love it. I don't book flights on my phone if I can help it and keep in mind that southwest and a few other carriers aren't on kayak.
1718,ZiCdaic,"March 5, 2017",5,Excellent app Very efficient and effective. I use it as the first (and usually last) place I go to book air. Would love a version where it let me save my preferences for sorting flights - always by duration and not cost.

1723,MSTnyc,"February 20, 2016",5,I like to pretend... I pick random destinations and see if kayak can get me a ticket for less than what I have in my checking account.  It usually finds me some place interesting and then I log off and go buy groceries.
1724,Goat chin,"February 27, 2016",4,Flight tracking This app is extremely helpful and I love it. One thing I would be ineffably grateful for is the improvement of the flight tracking feature meaning more map options and the listing of the plane type

1731,My name is Al,"November 26, 2012",5,Impressive The app is very intuitive and user friendly. Everything flows smoothly and searching for flights is a breeze. I'll never purchase another airline ticket unless I'm using this app!
1732,Auburnart,"November 27, 2012",5,Convenient Very easy to use. I just spent a few days searching for the perfect hotel on my laptop. I wish I would have known about this app because it's much easier to navigate!!
1733,JonRC,"January 24, 2013",5,"Fast, Simple, Perfect Fast searches, simple interface, and easy selection of options (picking flexible dates, refining results by duration, number of stops, airlines, etc). Also, has been very stable - no crashes yet!"
1734,Abdsantiago,"May 4, 2013",5,"Practical, gets the job done Relative to other travel / booking apps this one does all: car , hotel, flights.  I find it hard to understand why other well known travel COs are so behind in this regard.  Good job Kayak."
1735,Magousa,"June 1, 2013",5,"Great app! Never disappointed, always accurate with the most current information. Great to check prices and availability. I recommend it to anybody else who does a lot travel."
1736,"Sarasota, FL","September 13, 2013",3,"Go to ANYWHERE Wanted I love this app, as well as your website. Use it all the time, but would appreciate a go to anywhere option added into the search functions. Most of us have a set budget and number of days allocable holiday time. Would like to compare cost by destination in deciding where to go."
1737,ethanguetig,"March 3, 2014",5,"Great app!! Planning a trip right now, and it would be so much harder without this app! Very easy to use interface, love how it shows you other prices from different companies. I will forever use Kayak!"

1739,Door-p7,"April 19, 2014",5,Always a help It's great for finding trips anywhere for great prices and I love the fact it keeps me in check when I'm flying and my gate has changed way before they announce it over the PA system
1740,Golfchamp,"August 14, 2009",3,Still needs work The website is just awesome but this app is not there yet.  A lot of filtering options and text search options that make the web svc so powerful need to be added. Wanted to get a quote for hyatt in NYC and had to scroll through 700 options only to not find it. Pls keep working on these features
1741,maximy,"September 28, 2011",5,"Absolutely perfect! No more, no less than what is exactly needed. "
1742,Dtnb,"January 14, 2012",3,"Missing Sliders! Would have been an easy 5 stars had it had the sliders.  Kayak, time sliders are what make you more useful that other travel search engines; why remove them??  Now I have to try each travel time window separately, just like Expedia, etc.  Kayak was always the once and done site.  Please bring back the sliders!"
1743,JS43,"February 7, 2012",5,Best travel app yet I have been using other various free and paid travel apps an this by far is the best. Major improvements since their first app release. Found better prices on this app than online!
1744,QC Boy,"February 24, 2012",2,Flight prices higher in app! I kept the app for over a year and check it to see if it's fixed. When I find a flight on the app the price is higher than if I do the exact same search on the kayak website. I do not understand why this is the case. The same settings and I ensure the depart same airport is selected in the website. 
1745,Nurikianroy,"March 5, 2012",4,Great as always I have been using Kayak for years and this app is a great tool to check out flight prices and hotel fares from my iPad

1747,DinaWorks,"June 29, 2012",5,"Excellent! I love how flexible all the search options are. +/- 1 or 2 days, search nearby airports, one-way or round-trip --- these are all search features I need. The interface is friendly and easy to use."
1748,Theatheacher,"August 21, 2012",5,"Best The best travel app I've found. Lots of options and features. Quick search times if your connection is decent. Good flexibility for your non-normal trips (multi-city, for example). Highly recommend."

1750,Kezmosis,"October 8, 2016",5,"The Best Travel Booking App! This is a great app for travelers who are looking for the best airfare, best hotel prices, and best rental car prices.

1751,GirrGirr,"October 13, 2016",5,"Great APP!! Helps me find last minute flight for my friends. I usually check with other apps just in case I catch a better deal. So far Kayak has been finding all of them for me, at a fair price."
1752,mmr_518,"October 20, 2016",5,"My go to app when planning trips Before making any flights reservations, first place I check is my Kayak app. Checking flight info and tracking flights is a breeze."
1753,Fudge_brownie,"December 29, 2016",1,"Way Out Results Glad I did not waste the 99 cents on the other version.  Foreign travel with multicity booking gives so much different results than the web site.  It completely misses flights within an airline and always tries to package different carriers.  For instance Lufthansa will have a combined flight with Aerlingus for $6,000 while missing an Lufthansa connection in Frankfort or Munich for $800."
1754,CuibapxXzx,"December 30, 2016",5,"Great apps Compare to lots of apps I have been using , this one always seems to find a better price . "
1755,Gottadayjob,"January 9, 2017",5,A real timesaver I use it mainly for finding flights. I can easily filter and set preferred departure and arrival times to narrow my search. Then it takes me right to the airline site when I am ready to book!
1756,vektor12,"January 20, 2017",5,"Very good app Does what it is supposed to do. Strong functionalities, though I would prefer to be able to select either the departure or the return flight, just like on the website."
1757,Prabha's,"January 22, 2017",5,Once and done! It's google of travel I have been using this for more than 10 years to search my flights and hotels! It's the best travel search engine out there!

1759,PDXSkier,"March 23, 2017",5,Go to travel app Kayak is very quick and convenient. I have used it to find flights worldwide. Also use ITA and Google flights. I have found Kayak's interface to be easy and intuitive
1760,nnekajax,"February 28, 2016",4,Avid Kayak User Kayak is my go to travel app because it's so straightforward and easy to use. I think it does a great job of bringing together all of the best travel deals. The only issue I have is that the phone app does not show the hacker fares that I can see on the website.
1761,Gallop11354,"February 29, 2016",5,Very easy and convenient booking tool I have the app on my iPhone and always use it for flight booking. User friendly interface and easy to search. Best booking app I've ever used.
1762,Ttacmz,"April 1, 2016",4,"Setting options lacking Easy to use but lacks settings.  I would like to look for flights after 4pm, multiple airports, and duration less than 5 hours all at once.  I give it a 4 because it's better than c-trip."
1763,cft0012,"June 9, 2016",5,"Simple and quick I've used kayak for over 6 years now and booked 90% of my flights using it.  It's easy to use and can book trips that are more than just A to B. More like, A to B to C then back to A."
1764,Ke Ethiopia,"June 13, 2016",3,"Great travel Ticket App Great app. I used it daily to monitor flight deals, flights tracker, search best deals etc. I don't have any complaints as the app continuously gets upgraded. I wish it has a notification via text or from app to let me know when a flight I'm tracking lands or gets delayed etc"
1765,Tarabelle808,"July 4, 2016",5,It's rare I use anything else I love this app and I've booked many flights.  Love that they tell you to wait a few if it's not a good price.  I'm able to go out and see my best friend cheaper than driving!
1766,RoadWarrior112233,"July 21, 2016",5,"Incredibly useful All it takes is a few seconds to compare airline ticket prices , this app saved me a lot of time and hundreds of dollars over the years"
1767,Resqboy,"August 18, 2016",4,"Good app! The app has higher price sometimes than the desktop version. Also, too many confusing and annoying ads get on the way or are too close to actual link buttons."
1768,simplysanrio,"August 27, 2016",5,Makes keeping track of trips easy This is my go to travel app for both flight searches and for keeping all my travel plans in one place.
1769,Kfairadams,"September 12, 2016",1,"Don't upgrade If you have a really old version and like it then don't upgrade. If you don't have, don't bother. This is the same as all the other flight apps. They got rid of key feature which told you how many unsold seats were on the plane! This is why I chose this app over all the rest. Now anymore. I'm on the hunt for a different app that will give me open seat info like this app used to before they ruined it."
1770,KKAccordion,"August 15, 2013",5,Best in show So far Kayak has been the easiest travel app to use. I've easily researched my trip & got a great deal on a hotel. I'll let you know if I have to change my review once I book my trip but so far so good!
1771,Vijay Patil,"December 16, 2013",5,Super like this App I have been using this app for a year now. I have booked several vacations over the year. It's quick and easy. Best part is you have it all in one place. Finding deals is easy.
1772,Acer5000,"April 11, 2014",4,"Awesome It's phenomenal. On the actual website, however, I've seen that you can look at a flight/hotel combo? I didn't see that option on this app. I'd rate it 5 stars if that we're available. ...unless I've completely missed that package altogether."
1773,JBJBSF,"June 28, 2014",5,"Fabulous travel app I love the way I can forward confirmation emails to Kayak and the app will add it to ""My Trip"" for me, allow me to share the Trip with friends and also give me better alerts than the airlines do."

1777,Sadgracie,"January 10, 2016",5,"Love my Kayak app I've been using this app for nearly 3 years & have never had any problems with it. I love how it keep me organized on trips. (& I like how my trips are saved, so I can look back at where I've been)."
1778,Blenky_99,"January 18, 2016",4,Great app - use it constantly One of my most used apps since I travel a ton for work.  Use both flight research and flight monitoring. Sometimes it doesn't pull up every flight available but either way it generally rocks.
1779,kelin522,"February 22, 2016",5,Easy to use and find cheap flights Kayak makes it easy to find the cheapest flights. You can compare prices of different airlines and different dates. It's very comprehensive and user-friendly.
1780,Ougirl114,"April 27, 2012",5,I love it! It helps me check every day if there is a low price and helps me find the best deal and flight!!!! Also let's me create a check list for when I am packing for my flight!! <3 must have for all travel!
1781,Yurvlad,"June 23, 2012",4,"One of the best apps The only thing I don't like is inability to select non-stop flights or hotel ratings BEFORE the search. Because of that search takes longer. It would be nice to have an option to ""filter"" before the search."
1782,rpskentucky,"July 22, 2012",5,Love I'm in a long distance relationship so this app makes it super easy and fast to look for flights and hotels to and from each others cities or to rendezvous cities in between!!

1784,"""Little O""","November 18, 2012",5,No question Kayak is the best app for on the go searches of flight and hotel availability. Intuitive and exceptionally easy to navigate to return optimal results. Don't even consider the competitors anymore after using this app.

1791,AppleNoorJob,"December 16, 2011",5,Best traveling app! If you travel many times during the year and don't want to deal with travel agency kayak is your best friend. Tickets are about $200 cheaper compare to most travel agency and it's all at your fingertip.
1792,Jdubwir,"December 31, 2011",5,So easy and awesome app! The best part is being able to make reservations on a desktop and then I can pull up my trip information here. I never have to print out conformations again!!
1793,Ulose06,"January 9, 2012",4,"Monopoly When I downloaded the app I was already familiar with the game but being able to play when its a down period makes it better.

1796,WetzelHillman,"February 10, 2012",5,Travel: All Wrapped Up In One Use the packing list or design your own. This is just one of the useful options. Not to mention the usual suspects from a travel app. Kayak goes above and beyond; from the important to the fun info provided. Enjoy.
1797,Legionoc,"February 12, 2012",4,"Easy to use, lots of info There's an ease of use but once you search you can feel buried in all the info. If it was categorized or sorted for an easier interface than I would use it more than an old fashioned computer box thing."
1798,Numbaoneforeva,"April 4, 2012",5,"Best travel app I have ever used Convenient, quick little app that tracked my family's flight, allowed me to check there gate, and when I travel helps me keep tabs on gate changes. Well done kayak."
1799,Bright eyes978,"April 26, 2012",5,It's a great App! This app is great!!! It's easy and really simple to use. Not to mention it got me the lowest rates on airfare. I'm so excited and save $500 alone on airfare using this app. Saved great on hotels too. Kinda wish I would have booked my cruise on here. Trust next time I will.
1800,lboogieATL,"November 1, 2010",5,"lots of functionality this app makes booking flights really easy to do on the go. I don't even need to check other sites before confidently hitting that ""purchase"" button."
1801,Sweetz1782,"June 26, 2011",5,Great app I actually like it better than the Kayak site since it doesn't open up a bunch of windows to search (instead it does it for you and all the results come up in one spot).
1802,Siempre2luna,"August 15, 2011",5,"impressive kayak app! Awesome I was very impressed, at first I was just going to download the app, use it then delete it. But after I realized how detailed and helpful it was! I use it almost every week! Even if I am just curious about rates, or dreaming of vacationing."
1803,tguido,"September 12, 2011",5,"Better than the website Clean, intuitive, flexible - I think I like using the app more than the website to check out flight info and receive price alerts."
1804,Texanwest,"September 12, 2011",5,Love it! I took a 30 day motorcycle trip in July. The App always found us savings. We couldn't have had a better trip. We travel on a whim and decide while driving. You don't need to pre-plan with this app.
1805,Kali313,"January 28, 2017",5,Best Travel App Available Probably the best travel app available out there.  Orbitz has some great prices and Trip Advisor has a lot of great information but Kayak is the best streamlined app to find all of what you're looking for in 1 spot.
1806,Bardenhoff,"February 2, 2017",4,"It is a great app, prices better than on the website I have had a very positive experience with the app, although I believe some flights are still not as cheap as they should actually be. "
1807,zombieflu,"February 11, 2017",5,"I always use this all I love this app I use it every trip, I forward my emails to kayak and they put them on a trip itinerary along with confirmation emails, I also book flights with kayak"
1808,VT Blue,"February 22, 2017",4,"My Go-To I use Kayak all the time to plan trips, and the app is pretty good at allowing me to filter my preferences. I still wish it would remember some things rather than having to always start over and re-enter my preferences. Highly recommended."
1809,Kristingal,"March 4, 2017",5,Love Kayak This app is my favorite especially if I know specific dates. I wish they had more flexibility for flexible dates and lowest prices to travel to a location at any given time. But overall kayak is my go to.
1810,EmilyMadison,"May 20, 2016",5,Love this app! Love booking my trips with this app. I've compared it to Priceline multiple times and have always found a better deal here. Plus I love all the info you get and the ease of searching. Thanks Kayak!
1811,Rick35763,"August 19, 2016",1,"Poor Are you several apps for travel, and this one is the worst. I was trying to find a flight using both the laptop and my iPhone, so I downloaded this app. It totally is worthless the filters are not user-friendly the app is not user-friendly recommend whoever designed the app to look at other travel applications and copy some of the nicer features that most other apps have"
1812,w.furey,"September 22, 2016",5,"use first gives the best flight options and with great filtering algorithms. Kayak, of course, makes their money on your clicks to the airline's ticketing website but the service provided is super fast and time saving."
1813,Lilz L423,"September 26, 2016",5,"Ease in your pocket This has been a lifesaver and is quick to download flights to email to myself for later. Fairly intuitive overall. The filter is handy for selecting airlines, airports, durations and so forth."
1814,Brittanynorris18,"November 9, 2016",5,Great app!! Going to New York City for the first time planned a last minute trip less than a month away. I love all the customizable features and map view so we can see what we are close to!

1822,coffeemale,"November 15, 2014",1,Prices are too high!! I've been using priceline for years and thought I'd give kayak a try.  Oh heck no!  Kayak diverts you to all the most expensive flights known to man.  What I got for 437$ was 629 with kayak cheapest flights.  No way.   I looked several times as well with the same results.  The kicker with Priceline is that you can bid even lower then the suggested quote and possibly get it lowered.   So who's really getting the deal now kayak users?   Enjoy your flights$$$$
1823,DCnJax,"April 30, 2015",5,"Best travel site by far I been using Kayak for 10 years. I have been to Japan and back, Europe 3 times and all over the states. I never go wrong with this site and now the app makes my life easier."

1832,Whoever#1,"November 11, 2012",4,Excellent Apps! Time Saver. Extremely user friendly and fast. One star off because price from the alert doesn't really match when you actually make a booking in 24 hours from the time you received the alert.
1833,Toshirauma,"January 10, 2013",5,"Great, easy to use app! The is a very functional and surprisingly easy to use app. I would rather book tickets with this app than my desktop."
1834,cvinc,"January 18, 2013",2,"Too slow now Used to be the best flight tracker app, but now it takes nearly 1 minute to launch the app and almost another minute to launch the flight tracker option, even if just moving between apps. In the app world, that's an eternity, and there are other free ones out there that get the job done quicker. Would be great if Kayak fixed it."
1835,JMV123456,"January 20, 2013",5,A breeze to use I find Kayak to be the most straightforward and responsive travel site I have ever used. I have removed all others. It is intuitive and gives great info. No need for others.
1836,Figgy Pops,"May 5, 2013",4,Need more time to form a better opinion I only used the app for half an hour but already found hotels at 1/3 of the price as the other travel sites at one of the busiest and most expensive travel times of the year. So far very helpful...

1842,bryan131,"July 10, 2011",5,Amazing This is probably one of the best designed apps I have seen. The UI is very friendly and thought through. Even the packing list is brilliant. Keep up the good work!  You guys really know what people want and what works!
1843,OMFG LO,"August 7, 2011",5,Must have for any Traveler! Love this app and must have for any traveler. The ability to combine your flights hotels and such into an itinerary is pretty awesome. As well as the packing List. Love it. Use it all the time. Never forgotten anything yet since I've used this.
1844,Zeus_da_god,"September 20, 2011",3,"Add flight information Why can't I add my own flight information? I add information you give push notification. It's really simple. I don't want to send you an email. I don't need one more cyber paper trail of my activities.  Allow me to put in airline and flight number. You already have the time. C'mon, it's 2011, catch up."
1845,Jredstang,"February 1, 2012",4,Quick and convenient If you have used this before online you will love the ease of how this app works. Gives a good variety of vendors to choose from.  A few upgrades could be made in search parameters but over all really pleased.
1846,jjim007,"February 11, 2012",5,"Great app! Great app for searching flights although  after finding what I wanted, I completed my purchase from my computer. Not sure if that can be done within the app. May try next time, but great app."
1847,Thomas Whisenhunt,"February 25, 2012",5,Best travel app I love this app because it scans all of the possible travel sites out there to get you the best deal.  I wish I would have used them sooner I could have save over 500 dollars on my trip.
1848,Too busy for a PC,"June 13, 2012",5,"Easy travel planning in a pinch Intuitive, easy to use, and high-functioning app that makes searching for the best travel deal something you can do while waiting in line for coffee. Love it."
1849,Crownjul,"July 17, 2012",5,Thank you This app made my travel so much easier and hands down its finds the most inexpensive flights. Used Kayak for the last 5 years and the app makes it even easier.
1850,DJR777,"October 19, 2010",5,Must have This is a must have app for anyone thinking about traveling. Easy to use interface makes it easy to find and purchase what ever you need to get where your going.
1851,Dafratucker,"November 12, 2016",5,"Easy and reliable I am able to find all info needed easily from the app. I use Kayak frequently for hotels, flights and rental cars and what is promised is always delivered, no problem."
1852,News2050,"December 8, 2016",5,Works well! Been using this app for a long time - it works well. Better than the desktop version which opens up browser windows surreptitiously and suspiciously.
1853,Syracusecold,"January 18, 2017",5,Fast and useful app I use the application for looking for flights. It is very fast and gives many options to choose from. This is a best app for finding flights
1854,Apaugasma,"February 25, 2017",5,"Best Around for Research It is the only alternative to google flights for research but this is the better tool when you have a range of dates, and most of the time it has the lowest prices."
1855,Thatguyjonboy,"March 14, 2017",5,"My Go-To App I shop around frequently for flights, hotels, really anything necessary for any kind of trip... and I'm sure it's no matter of coincidence that I always end up booking through Kayak."
1856,Texandmav,"April 13, 2017",5,Great pricing options! I like that you can see all the pricing options if you have flexible travel dates. I found a flight for half the price when I made my dates flexible.
1857,Bdlmsplaygrnd,"April 18, 2017",1,"Always Needs To Know Your Location! Even when I'm not using the app it is ""on"" in the background. How rude! Why can't these companies be polite and set detecting out location only ""while using"" the app. Why do we have to go into locations settings and change it ourselves? Why does Kayak always need to know where we are and what do they plan to do with that information? I think we all should start asking."
1858,Csinkingfast,"May 25, 2017",5,Very convenient I've used Kayak twice recently and both times saved a lot of money over the advertised prices on the hotel and airline websites. App is very convenient to use.
1859,Tenchitis,"July 4, 2017",5,Cannot change dates!!! Cannot change the dates when i want to check prices. New look is unresponsive and frustrating. Please FIX asap
1860,Csad22,"February 28, 2016",5,"Can be misleading The app is great for informational purposes, however it ups the prices from what it displays on a computer. So I use it to get an idea of trip costs and availability but do not use it to book."
1861,Sam Swaminathan,"March 5, 2016",4,"Kayak's service quality I love Kayak and use it almost always to book international flights, since it offers better price points. However, when redirected to Vayama, the customer service there leaves a lot to be desired."
1862,MTA traveler,"May 28, 2016",5,Clear and concise info Easy to use and read and offers accurate info. I always check flight info on the app before booking.
1863,buxopshere,"May 28, 2016",5,Easy Peasy! Love this app!  Trying to plan a surprise trip for my niece to visit at the cheapest cost.  The +/- days gave us great options.  Also love being able to filter out flight times to make for optimal planning.
1864,HTW,"June 30, 2016",5,"Great though... This is my go-to flight and hotel search app. However, it doesn't remember your search history (unlike the website)."
1865,pcJmac,"October 2, 2016",5,"Best way to find flights by combining filters No matter what your criteria are for selecting a flight, Kayak has you covered!  Finally I can easily set up what is important to me and get the filtered results I am looking for!"
1866,AshleyUmm,"October 10, 2016",4,Works for me Have been using the app for about a year or so and I think it works great for me I wish it offered minor details that are available on the original website(via desktop) but really functional.
1867,seds424,"October 19, 2016",5,Very helpful I use Kayak to help plan every trip I take and it find it very helpful to compare fares for various options. I especially like the plus or minus 3 days feature to help me find cheaper flights.
1868,Hereandnownomad,"November 3, 2016",5,"My go to for work I travel every week for work and kayak has been my go to. Simple interface, easy to send flight request to travel agent and easy to filter."

1870,KelBel06,"June 29, 2013",5,"Wonderful! Capability to search multiple airports and flights in one search based on your location. Great!! No problems with this app, which is hard to come by!"
1871,Shaival1,"March 21, 2014",4,Accurate. Fast. Efficient. Great filters. Needs ability to buy kids tickets. Perfect app. Almost....  Would have given it 5 stars if I could actually buy tickets for my kids. Not able to currently buy tickets for kids or seniors.
1872,katyM011,"May 26, 2014",5,"Easy flight searching! Easy to use when searching for flights, including filter options!"
1873,FlavioJp,"January 5, 2015",5,So far so good This app it's amazing it has been a great tool to compare prices and also makes it easy and fast no lagging or crashes...loads very quick on my iPhone 6 by Sprint perfect keep up the good work
1874,Rooms not available,"April 12, 2015",1,"Don't trust the booking service Kayak should be ashamed they promote rooms that are not real. On 4-11 I was able to book a room at the the Hampton Suites in Tulsa OK - when I went to check in I found not only was the hotel full, but that they never heard of my confirmation number.  When I tried to confirm with their booking service Agoda they were not shocked, provided no alternative, and said it would take 7-10 days to refund my money."
1875,cocotice,"December 21, 2015",5,Efficient App Kayak always seems to compare the best deals around that other large search engines skim over. Easy to use and easy to play around with dates. It's my go to for travel research.
1876,BrianW2012,"January 10, 2016",5,Very impressed First time user.  Able to do various flight combinations (round trip/multi city) to/from Dulles and Lisbon/Faro Portugal.  Very pleased with features to adjust stops and costs to find best flight.  I will use again.
1877,crivazquez,"January 14, 2016",5,Price alerts! You are able to put a proce alert and track prices either weekly or even daily to obtain THE best prices! It even tells you to wait or buy with confidence!
1878,Kimonalo,"February 20, 2016",5,"Must have app for travelers I have used kayak for years and as soon as they came out with the app, I downloaded it. Kayak makes it so easy to search for the best prices in travel. It's my go to "
1879,Ppd408,"February 21, 2016",5,Excellent resource for air tickets. I've been able to find better air ticket deals than some travel agency I had used to use. The app is super easy to use.
1880,Abettaboiler,"February 23, 2012",2,Kayak I have looked through it the prices are not competitive in fact there are the highest . I figured the hole reason is to get your Ipeople the best prices possible I think  maybe u guys can negotiate some type of deals with these airline since u are giving them business only when it comes from any apple products or when they log on to kayak .
1881,Enug,"February 29, 2012",5,"Excellent! This app allows you to search and book while also plan your vacations! I love it, it definitely makes things a lot easier while booking!"
1882,Chrisb321,"March 13, 2012",5,"Great app, as expected from Kayak.  My flight search tool of choice! This app works as you would expect.  Easy search options, easy to adjust and filter.  multi date, city options.  Great!"
1883,sanconn,"March 20, 2012",4,Crashes sometimes Good. When searching for flights and other features . Crashes when search on iPhone while you search second time and change route
1884,Work2little,"March 31, 2012",4,Worked great This app found me a cheap flight and was easier to use than the competition.
1885,Lir06003,"April 25, 2012",5,Great travel app I like the app but I set up an alert for a specific flight and I never get a notification on the deals. Does anyone know how to setup? I tired going in settings to fix it but I am unable to.
1886,Arc48,"October 4, 2012",5,Time saver This is a fantastic app that I use for both business and personal travel. It saves hours of searching he web for deals. Plus it often finds deals I don't.
1887,Platanoes Concachup,"January 2, 2013",4,"Billing nightmare Purchased ticket in-app, got charged, did not get a confirmation number or flight locator (Delta flight) Proceeded to spend two plus hours  hours just trying to get my money back. Will not purchase though this app ever again."
1888,Andy384,"January 24, 2013",5,Great app No longer need to use my laptop to find the best prices and times from the best website for finding flights! Definitely recommend to others.
1889,OKCDrew,"March 20, 2013",5,"Better than orbitz I had the orbitz app and loved the simplicity  , but I couldn't price watch many needed flights among several other needed tools. This app does that and so much more.  Highly recommended."
1890,markartis,"September 8, 2009",5,Crashes after Flight Search why was this released without testing? crashes after a simple flight search ... every time!
1891,Mhehehe,"January 4, 2010",5,Multi-city search I really like this app just I flight often to multi destinations and I don't have the ability of booking my flights thru this app. I hope we will have it soon!! Congrats!
1892,teknos,"January 22, 2010",5,Still crashing Still crashing even after update. Most unstable when trying to search flights.
1893,TXBayer,"August 5, 2010",4,Top notch This is the best flight search app available. Does not let you book but the mobile purchase experience provided by airlines and other travel providers is subpar anyway so no real disadvantage there. Kayak's Search far exceeds that of SWA and AA iPhone apps (and those are both very good apps).
1894,Ron72,"October 1, 2010",5,Awesome !!! One of the best Apps in the market very organized and detailed. It is exactly what a frequent and non frequent  traveler needs. The packing list is great I can enter a reminder for things that I need to take with me for my future travel plans. 5 
1895,palamnaeus,"September 1, 2011",5,"Awesome. Almost as good as the website A little less customizable than the full kayak website, but it has notifications for low fare alerts without the need to register."
1896,Jaaag,"October 11, 2011",5,"Saved a lot of money and time Arrived in Las Vegas, and searched on Kayak and found a cheap  but nice resort that  same day. Easy to use and was the best price compared to other search applications...will use it again in the future "
1897,hamcs,"November 13, 2011",5,Great Air flight App It's easy to use and it have a lot of options that other apps don't have.
1898,RICHARD PHANEUF,"December 31, 2011",5,"Best travel app!! I've been using kayak since someone whispered it to me like it was a secret, and it still seems to be the case. I check it's results against other popular sites and it always either beats them or ties. Great app!"
1899,Jdub5161976,"February 5, 2012",5,"App frequently crashes I like the concept of this app, but it is buggy and frequently crashes, especially if you try to filter by things like star rating."
1900,29727,"August 18, 2016",5,Great for setting up multi city flights Kayak is great for helping set up multiple city flights. It can be a tedious process otherwise. Also love fight tracker so I know when friends who are flying to see me will land.
1901,ladywinter2,"September 12, 2016",5,"My go-to app! Kayak is great! I use it all the time. I especially love the notification option, you can set it to notify you of price changes every day! Also nice for multi-stop flights."
1902,AL-Diva,"September 24, 2016",5,Easy to use... I have tried several travel apps lately and this one is easy to use and clear in terms of the information presented.  It is my new go to!
1903,FJS91,"November 24, 2016",5,"Very handy app I have been using Kayak for the past few versions and it's a must-have for traveling. It's stable, reliable and the free version is enough for most people's needs. Try it out! :-)"
1904,Billsgrrl,"December 24, 2016",5,"Great App I love Kayak, as it helps me organize my trips, whether I need just a flight or a whole vacation package. I still do my research to make sure I'm getting the best deal, but Kayak seems to be most consistently the best deal."
1905,PilsnerMac,"December 25, 2016",5,"Everything in one place Review your entire itinerary in one place! Forward your email confirmations to kayak and watch them all appear with helpful forms, flight info, and more."
1906,Snowhawk 64,"January 31, 2017",5,Flight Tracking Very Useful I have had this app for a while.  I especially have enjoyed using it to see if visitors' flights were on time and what terminal to get them
1907,Zim the man,"April 12, 2017",5,Must have for travelers Great app! Don't normally write reviews but this is an amazing app for travelers. It keeps you updated on all of your flights and even which gates they are. Highly recommend downloading this app!!
1908,Racqs P.,"June 24, 2017",5,"Excellent App Kayak App is on hand and extremely useful, finding a group of flights from various airlines at the best price. The app is accurate and dependable. I would recommend anyone to download this app!"
1909,livfresh,"July 6, 2017",3,"Smooth redesign with some bugs Great interface, colors, and almost a full suite of features seen on the website. Some things that are missing: can't select dates in 2018 in the app. Hotel room descriptions often don't specify how many beds (they only say how many people the room can sleep)."
1910,Tlc mom,"March 7, 2015",1,"HORRIBLE!! I set up to rent a car, provided  credit card info & pick up/drop off dates. Then we proceeded to watch the processing wheel spin for 30 minutes!"
1911,Wiltshs,"January 3, 2016",5,"Totally rely on Kayak I rely on Kayak's mobile app and website to give me the best range of fare options and for filtering results on various criteria. The app is really handy for just a quick review of airfares in particular, and it's super easy to use."
1912,JeniEatWorld,"January 4, 2016",5,Extremely easy and functional! My favorite travel app! Easy to use with almost as much functionality as the website.
1913,Constellationleo,"January 10, 2016",5,"A travel assistant! This app has gotten even better and easier to use over the years.  It's my go to for flights, especially with the price notifications. Great app!"
1914,Owner of homes,"January 14, 2016",5,"Easy way to plan a trip Kayak is a convenient way to find flights, hotels, and cars at competitive prices, and filters simplify sorting through multiple choices."
1915,Credulouskeptic,"January 24, 2016",5,"Easy, efficient, good I like how directly one can get to the prices and options.  The feature that helps you judge if flight pricing might drop lower if you wait to buy was great!"
1916,Maharshi Mehta,"January 27, 2016",5,"Maharshi Mehta I have been using this application for more than 5 years now; very useful- I prepare my business and personal tour based on need, price, shortest time, reaching or departing time to utilize days; it gives rightful choices."

1918,Varunvenu,"June 23, 2016",5,Awesome user experience The app is very easy to use. Their flight tracker feature is very useful and user friendly. Got great deals while booking my flight tickets as well.
1919,revtjesq,"August 2, 2016",5,Best travel app out there. Easy to use. Lots of information. Shows you the prices of things with all the fees etc so there are no surprises when checking out.
1920,Rahjo San Carlos,"February 11, 2013",5,Great app. Lots of info that easily drilled down to I usually use a computer to search for flights but this app lets you drill down on flight info really easily. Good app! Now I'll have to fly more places.
1921,Blendmaster30,"February 19, 2013",5,Love this app!! Nice how it puts the total price together on round trips! Not like those other sites that separate the outgoing and return flight prices trying to deceive you! Would recommend for everyone!!
1922,FCBusyBee,"March 13, 2013",5,"Handy App Love to use this app, especially for flights. Always gives multiple sites to buy from, and gives the final price (including taxes and fees) before you click."
1923,JHigh5,"March 24, 2013",5,Great app Keeps your city and date info for at least a week without opening the app. Gives you prices of the other websites just like the commercials say.
1924,Mistyapril,"September 24, 2013",5,Great app & great site I've used kayak several times to research & purchase flights. I've had great luck every time & it truly is the best pricing at one site. I've compared to every other discount & airline site. Wonderful!
1925,Patague,"January 17, 2014",5,Can't Beat it!!!!! Kayak is THE best to find a hotel for you and anywhere and you can compare from other websites or apps and kayak will have the lowest price for the same room you're looking at
1926,Psi1212,"January 23, 2014",5,Best travel app So easy to choose options and run a quick query.  Can take a bit long and filtering is a bit difficult but overall a great mobile app.
1927,Leoarna,"July 17, 2014",5,Quick and convenient This app works really well. I find it very convenient to browse the different ways I can find to reach my destination. It's pretty fast and accurate.
1928,Batmanspaz,"September 24, 2014",5,Don’t leave home without it Traveling all the time means you are always looking for flight options to fit in meetings.  Kayak is the first place I look for any travel arrangements.
1929,7WOE,"February 3, 2015",5,Awesome app I see tons of negative reviews because the packing list feature went away...wow. How old are we? This app helped me find cheap tickets through push notifications. Very helpful.
1930,Irie_1,"November 17, 2011",5,Better then website!!! Kayak mobile is great!!!! It's even better then the website. I recommend this app to ANYONE thinking of reserving a hotel or flight! Fast and efficient!!! Saved tons of money!!!
1931,tomwickland,"February 7, 2012",5,"A Go-To Travel App When planning a trip or when making changes along the way, I always check Kayak. Results are quick and straight forward."
1932,Randy32489,"February 17, 2012",5,Great Just awesome. One thing missing. An option to check cheapest dates to fly. Ex: I want to go to costa rica but don't know when it's the cheapest to fly. Just make an option to search ALL dates. ( I still give it five stars.
1933,Xervyus,"June 9, 2012",5,Best travel app ever!!!!! I spend a lot of time on the road and having to look at Expedia and orbitz and such gets old. This app allows you to fully customise your search with ease. I don't use anything else. Love it!!!
1934,SuperSlickdealer,"June 16, 2012",5,"Awesome This app is packed with features. You can email them your itinerary and they will organize it and keep a copy of email so u can easily see it. U can also track flights, convert currencies etc. awesome app."
1935,wrenhansen,"July 8, 2012",5,Seriously impressed with Kayak!! I love this app. I have booked several trips and adventures through the kayak app and it is the best I have used. Nothing like seeing all the options in one place. Thank you for investing in such an engaging app!!
1936,mkduran,"September 28, 2012",5,Very helpful and convenient I use this to look up potential flights and it is a quick and convenient interface
1937,Brbarlow,"October 19, 2012",5,Great app This app is great for any type of traveling plans! I continuously use it for booking hotels and flights and it always gives me the best prices. It's also very easy to use and has great options
1938,Asher_Nora,"November 10, 2012",5,Easy and fast! This app is easy to use. I use it whenever we need to book flights. Never crashed on me. Fast and convenient. Oh and I always find good deals for flights!
1939,ASKleiner,"February 6, 2013",5,"Incredible Fastest and most intuitive way to search for a flight! What a time saver. Also super easy to search and send itineraries to friends and family! Thank you, thank you, Kayak!"
1940,abc.gy,"December 13, 2009",5,"It's Brilliant. This is a really well designed app. It's easy to use and fast (on Wi-fi). As another reviewer noted, the ability to do multiple segments would be nice. But this is a free app after all. They've thrown down the guantlet to Orbitz and the airlines."
1941,Sporktastic,"February 12, 2010",4,"Great, but needs in-app browser Very handy for finding low fares and room rates.  It would help if web pages linked from listings could open within the app, rather than by launching Safari.  Although Kayak helpfully remembers your place, the hopping between apps is awkward."
1942,Kyleiphone,"February 21, 2010",4,"Great app just few things need to fix It's a bit of a memory hog or leaks, and when I want to search flight needs and option where I can choose times not sorting them just and option before searching."
1943,LMF1212,"June 18, 2010",5,Much improved The new release of this app is far more stable. They have improved the interface and it is more appealing. Have used several times without trouble.
1944,aboxofbeats,"October 11, 2010",3,"Flight tracker function still crashes Still crashes upon selecting flights to track, even after the update that supposedly fixed the problem. The seperate kayak flight tracker app doesn't have this problem so I know they are capable of making it work right."
1945,Sooze G,"November 3, 2010",4,"Kayak Love this app! The only problem (and it is a big concern) is the inability to purchase insurance when buying airline tickets. Other than that, this is a wonderful way to find the lowest price on a flight (without long layovers!) Easy search, easy purchase, and Kayak charges NO FEES."
1946,Joe and Carla,"April 18, 2011",5,"Functional app. I have been using kayak app for airline,"
1947,hflvn,"June 8, 2011",4,"True travel companion Great app, use it all the time. But one thing I don't understand, why limit the currencies? Some major currencies missing - perhaps oversight on Kayak's part? Anyway, love the travel check list! Use it all the time!"
1948,BeaYoungs,"September 25, 2011",5,Ease of use So nice to have when you don't want to turn on your computer. Convenient to check for flights on I-phone instead - quick and easy.
1949,StephMatos,"November 3, 2011",4,Better than website This app is great and easy to use. It even saves your recent searches which is helpful if your shopping for flights. The only issue i'm having is that it is no longer displaying flights eith jetblue. WHY!
1950,LukaSarp07,"April 18, 2009",5,"Works fine For those of you who reported crashing problem , make sure you restart your iphone often. I have used this app and works great so far."
1951,juleeny,"September 4, 2009",3,"Good but crashes alot Great concept but it crashes alot. I actually had to uninstall it and then reinstall it since it kept crashing. Also i think the ""cheap,"" ""soon"" and whatever the third tab is named are not intuitive and a failed attempt to be cute. It has the potential to be great but not there yet."
1952,Fmttrvlr,"September 11, 2016",5,Best airplane ticket search site Kayak consistently give lowest airplane ticket prices.  The results layout is better than google flights.
1953,Onurforu,"September 23, 2016",5,Lean interface Simple and lean user interface with a lot of options to filter down the flight I want makes it my go-to flight application
1954,nshah_78,"December 18, 2016",5,My Goto travel app but Could be better Forwarding to a specific trip in my account doesn't work that well. Flight tracker is an awesome and accurate feature.
1955,Curlygurl425,"January 14, 2017",5,Kayak is awesome I think that Kayak is one of the best apps that can be used for travel. It really shows you the best deals and is super easy to use. I highly recommend that everyone download this app.
1956,27Buttons,"January 18, 2017",5,My favorite travel planning website I've been using it for years and always find the best available deals on all of my travel needs.
1957,Locutis10320,"May 29, 2017",5,"Consistently the best! KAYAK has been the easiest to use, best at deal finding than any other travel APP. No ""mystery motels"" in the porno district or in another case I got a better discount than I would have with AARP. Kayak is my ""go to"" travel app."
1958,Daveydav1,"July 26, 2017",2,"Where are the boxes!!! I loved the boxes you checked as you search. Those were clutch! I am going to Germany and have a transfer. I wanted to select the first intercontinental flight but also wanted to see my options for the layover part. Now, because there are no boxes that then create a filter... I have a lot less control. Please bring them back!"
1959,NFTY9,"July 26, 2017",5,Best flight prices I've tried a few apps and kayak has consistently had the lowest flight prices. Their tools are easy to use and I've saved a lot of money. Thanks!
1960,Archaeosteph,"January 23, 2016",5,Love the travel alerts I set several travel alerts for all my upcoming trips. I like how I can choose between exact dates or entire months. I can monitor prices every morning.
1961,Boobyface(s and a Kapgan),"January 25, 2016",5,Using for years Great app. This is my go to for flight reservations although unfortunately southwest airline doesn't participate. I like the hotel search feature here too.
1962,Jimmyjz,"February 20, 2016",5,"All of my bookings start on Kayak I find it to be my go-to app, the one I use for all flights and cars. It's accurate, easy to use and the filters make it my favorite travel app out there."
1963,Imagineer97,"February 21, 2016",4,"Much much improved! The latest update made the app much better than before. You can easily search for flights, and add the good ones to a ""trip"" where you can see them and compare them."
1964,Nathan149,"February 22, 2016",5,Perfect for flight shopping and flight status I use it to do preliminary flight shopping. Also great to track flights if you're picking someone up at the airport.
1965,franky949,"February 27, 2016",5,My one stop travel agent Very simple and intuitive user interface. Love being able to quickly narrow down options to make my selections.

1969,Jetah2,"August 31, 2016",5,"B O O M Always use this when looking up flights, hotels, and cars. If you're only searching directly through the airlines/hotels/cars websites you are missing out and not using your time wisely."
1970,StockholmSydney,"July 5, 2014",5,"Easy to use Very easy to use, I love that the reviews bring you right to the source site so you can look at the pictures and read other reviews too!"
1971,WearyWarrior,"September 26, 2014",3,"App Should Have Been Beta Tested By An Actual Air Traveler Once again, I am confronted by an app developed by IT geeks that obviously haven't left their cubicle farm. Multi city trips can have a different number of travelers per leg. That's the most glaring deficiency I've found so far. Kayak corp would be wise to send their development team on a few trips."
1972,Flytwofives,"March 12, 2015",5,Great App I consulted with this app to watch the rate of planes tickets. It was easy to use and navigate. I loved that my dates for travel were saved so that I could just open the app and check the prices.

1975,Lauren26383838627,"December 30, 2015",5,Best go-to for low fares I'm constantly booking trips and Kayak is the easiest way to find the lowest fare. I've been using it for years and wouldn't use anything else. I just wish it included Southwest fares as well!
1976,Ellen Rahs,"January 3, 2016",5,"So Helpful I always get the best flight deals on Kayak! People have suggested other apps and websites but Kayak always beats the other sites. I've also gotten great rental car deals also! Once, I rented a car for $9/day in Miami!!! Love Kayak!"
1977,Rach the Mage,"January 15, 2016",5,"Best Travel App ever No other air booking app is better than Kayak! It lists all the deals, from the cheapest to the most expensive ones, the travel time and duration, AND the price prediction of each ticket! It is awesome!"
1978,Basst82,"January 15, 2016",4,"Sometimes requires ""big computer"" The app is pretty good but there is some functionality, especially with filters and flight timing that isn't built into the app. "
1979,Shinderelli,"January 21, 2016",5,So helpful! This is my go-to app for when I need to book travel or compare prices.  It's so fast and easy and I don't have to visit a bunch of different sites to find the best deals!
1980,ignitious muckle,"July 4, 2012",2,"Nice search, but booking is very hit and miss Searching is very nice, one of the best, but booking is a very frustrating experience. While trying to book a flight I eventually gave up. I had entered all my information and when I went to book I had to wait and wait and wait and then had to re-enter my information. Very frustrating."

1984,Otto and Gracie,"February 13, 2013",5,Excellent for full time travelers. As an airline employee I find this app more accurate and timely than what my airline provides me.   International travel deserves a bit more attention however.
1985,K Luth,"March 9, 2013",5,"Only place to look This app gives you just the right amount of information, quick easy."
1986,Defiantly Stated,"April 20, 2013",5,"Superior performing App Job well done by the creators of this app. It performs well for the consummate planner.

1991,Eric Johnson,"May 13, 2011",4,"Great for finding deals on the go! Easy to navigate. I've found it fairly easy to book reservations if you get sent to the main clearinghouses (Expedia, etc.) but a little more cumbersome if you get connected with the hotel directly. :-/"

1993,Willsnow,"November 16, 2011",5,"Great application for travel I've used a lot of sites and applications for finding flights, hotels and cars and I never fail to come back to kayak. It's a great app with a great interface and consistently finds the best deals"
1994,amx9854,"February 19, 2012",5,Better than website Very easy to use app.  I much prefer it over the actual kayak website. Extremely easy to use and right to the point.

1996,Redline888,"March 4, 2012",5,"Fantastic time saver. Makes the process of selection of flights, car rentals and lodging highly efficient.  Information is accurate.  Site is very easy to navigate"
1997,TIER-MJW,"April 2, 2012",5,Does it all!! This is a clean and efficient app that gets the job done without much fuss. I only wish it would provide an easy grouping method for the various airline alliances. That would be helpful.
1998,Gotgamelikemario,"April 10, 2012",5,"Greatest app in the world This app is amazing. With its all in one appeal I was able to book a getaway car, find a cheap motel and a flight to Mexico all in just minutes. If it wasn't for Kayak they might have caught me. Thanks Kayak"
1999,hilldrums,"June 27, 2012",1,"Watch out for Non-Refundable hotels Beware! I made a non-refundable hotel reservation without realizing it using this app! Kayak customer service says that because you get an email confirmation telling you about the non-refundable hotel room after you book it, then you should know - but that is only after the fact! I didn't realize the room was non-refundable using the app. I will never use the app again!"
2000,album man,"October 3, 2010",4,"A touch confusing but gets the job done I found some of the navigation around the app a bit on the confusing/roundabout way, but I love being able to compare prices of airlines ad check dates. I use it all the time."

2005,Savvas A Savva,"February 26, 2017",5,"One stop Shop A search engine for travel. Airfare, Hotel and Car. The best of its kind with many filters to customize your searches. Even let's you create alerts. The best."
2006,Homer59999,"April 8, 2017",2,"Not very reliable Rates shown are often ""no longer available"".  The booking form is not very quick for a mobile devices - most fields take forever to fill out, lots of duplication and in efficiencies which are annoying while on a mobile device.  Sometimes it gets you the best prices though, so there's that."
2007,Superstressful,"June 13, 2017",5,Frequent Flyer It's extremely helpful and I've been looking for an app like this for a long time!! Definitely relieves a lot of the stress I have when I'm flying alone. Thank you so much for this wonderful app!!
2008,ok2useLane,"July 4, 2017",1,"Current version is BUGGY! Usually, I love this app.  However, the date selection portion (for flights) is completely useless in this version.  Making it impossible to use...even causing app to crash on my iPad!  If they would fix it, then I hope it would be as useful as it was before this ""update.""  How could they screw up a simple calendar date selection???  Ugh!"
2009,Freecell_lover,"July 31, 2017",5,Excellent app My trips feature is great. It imported my trips perfectly.

2015,Tbay41,"September 6, 2016",5,"My ""Go to"" Travel App Whether for a hotel or flight - domestic or international - Kayak is my first choice, and always the one I come back to after checking others. They set the bar - and it's REALLY high."
2016,Alright Girl :-)1,"September 23, 2016",5,"Alright Girl ;-) Use this app often.  Very helpful to plan trips for myself, family & friends to visit.  I also like the way it will track prices as to know when the price lowers."
2017,Vellux_255,"October 6, 2016",4,Great app I use this free app for itinerary's all the time. My only complaint is that the software doesn't pick up my full trip from my emails 100% of the time. Still pretty fantastic to have everything in one place with a few clicks.

2029,kripasagar,"January 26, 2016",4,Excellent app! I always use Kayak for booking travel within the US and abroad. One suggestion for improvement: It would be nice if it would account for specials our airline specific deals. Still plan to use the app for travel.
2030,vicmatta,"February 2, 2012",5,Perfect for basic searches Did a great job of quick check on fares. Couldn't do better as an app. PC version of course has some adv due to having more space to show stuff.
2031,Racharoo702,"February 2, 2012",5,Kayak Easier than the website and very helpful to check prices while on the go. Seems to have the lowest prices of the other apps that I have used.
2032,cmwneuro,"February 5, 2012",5,Great travel planning aid Frequent traveler for business and pleasure. This is my favorite planning tool on the iPad looking for flights and hotels.

2044,Brtstark22,"January 27, 2012",4,Price changes I like the ability to see how the prices change over time and as the holidays come up. Sometimes the daily reminders of airport fares show a $200 difference from one day to the next. Very interesting.

2054,TLA55,"June 17, 2016",5,Nice App I use this as a central repository for both my business and personal travel. I do not use it for booking hotels or airlines. I like the UI and ease of use sending travel info to the app via email.
2055,Wendy BG,"June 25, 2016",5,Best on the market I use plenty of apps for travel and find I prefer this one. The app is really easy to use on my phone and they usually beat any other site in price. Very happy so far.

2062,cubbiesandsox,"July 23, 2015",5,Better than orbitz or any other traveling app No extra fees and they lay out all other competitors prices. Awesome and easy to use when you have a hectic schedule already!
2063,BigIslandBrigid,"October 27, 2015",2,"Used to love it. Less so, now. With iOS getting its act together, this app is becoming less and less useful to me. I now have all my flight info automatically in my calendar, and I find I'm opening kayak less and less, ESPECIALLY since they got rid of the packing list feature!! That was so convenient, and now all my carefully planned list are gone. Boo!!"
2064,Avs07,"December 11, 2015",5,"awesome! 😍 love all the new design changes. So easy and convenient  to switch between tracking a flight , looking at your trip, checking price alerts"

2073,RaAmonO,"April 15, 2012",4,"Everything that I expected from Kayak I first downloaded this app with I had a Blackberry Curve, the on my HTC Evo and now on my iPhone 4s. It is everything that I have come to expect from Kayak. It's efficient and many times offers great last minute deals."
2074,BobCope,"August 6, 2012",4,"Review of Kayak This is an excellent very useful travel app which keeps getting better and better. I use it to contact airlines, to book and compare fares, etc.  I hope the developers keep improving and refining it in the months ahead."

2076,dr.john,"February 16, 2013",5,"Best Travel App I Own This is by far the best travel app I own; and that includes the propriety airline and other supposedly comprehensive apps. More than that, they've made it simple, intuitive, and easy to use."

2080,Iron Buckeye,"September 17, 2009",2,"A step down This was a rock-solid and nicely done app - until the last update. Kayak now crashes way too frequently and has become rather annoying. Also, the new icon is U-G-L-Y and looks horribly out of place on the iPhone's home screen. Sounds petty, but it bugs me. I hope they fix both of these problems because it was functionally a decent app."

2082,what smell?,"September 1, 2011",5,good collection of sources You don't have to have all the answers:  you just have to know where to find them. Kayak helps you get answers to your travel questions.
2083,nrcs,"November 7, 2011",2,"Always adding awesome! Server error twice this week, cannot view my reservations due to this. Can't understand why you'd allow this to happen again. Lowering my rating to due unreliability."

2085,Seateems,"January 26, 2017",5,"My go-to travel app I travel a fair amount, and I always check Kayak first for flights, hotels & cars. Easy interface, good filters & results I can trust. It's a must when I'm planning trips."
2086,Pharming,"February 8, 2017",5,Never a problem Updates after initial entry of saved trips and prices change.  But this app is never a disappointment.
2087,Amrkeals,"February 13, 2017",5,"The best I tried so many apps for 2 months and this was my best experience ever, It gives me the real flights updates on time and saves me around $500 on my flight New York to Algiers ."
2088,Robyn Etta,"March 12, 2017",5,Ms Great for organizing trip. It organizes flights and confirmations. Just need to email receipt or it picks it up from email. Can also add your own custom trip items. I have not done any purchases.
2089,Bob08008,"March 26, 2017",5,"Simple and effective I recently used Kayak to find, by far, the cheapest auto rentals and to find a much more effective schedule than offered by United.  Go to ap for air and rental car planning."
2090,Kdkessler1,"June 4, 2016",5,Excellent and easy to use The app is very intuitive and allows control over many many variables of your flight choices
2091,Greeleybowl,"June 15, 2016",5,"Easy to use, nice app Wish southwest was integrated, but certainly not kayak's fault.  Otherwise very customizable for finding what you need wo the pop ups of the desktop version"
2092,Happyfrogger76,"June 30, 2016",5,Usually great Sometimes gives higher prices if I search multiple times. Otherwise great features and layout
2093,cuemby,"July 4, 2016",5,"Awesome app! I'll love the simplicity, the UI/UX is very intuitive. In terms of functionality its exactly what is suppose to do, the search is great and my favorite future is the alerts it really does a wonderful job."

2095,john7305,"October 1, 2016",5,Super convenient The price alert is the best thing about the app. Set up your airports and dates and it will alert you when the price goes up or down. Super helpful for planning trips
2096,Lagging runner,"October 12, 2016",5,Best flight app I've seen Very intuitive and flexible in being able to look for flight options based on multiple adjustable criteria.

2100,Con Wheezy,"November 17, 2014",5,"Quick and easy! This app does a wonderful job of finding flights quickly and easily. It's so good, I use it in place of my laptop or any browser."
2101,L2theE,"January 10, 2015",5,Awesome This app is great. I like the fact that I don't have to go to numerous sites to see what prices are available because all the info is right there whenever you use Kayak.
2102,Socrateszs,"April 21, 2015",4,"Simple to use and very clean BUT It's not the best on finding the best prices... I have other apps like JetRadar that finds way cheaper and i mean most of the time.. So, might work on your search bc cheaper flights attract the most people and we all know that.."
2103,Brand New 2 This,"November 8, 2015",3,"Not bad, not amazing I've had decent experience with the Kayak app. Though a few times, when clicking on a ticket, i would find out it was unavailable. Why would it be posted as an option then? Other than that, I've been pretty pleased with it!"
2104,Jjmcsales,"January 27, 2016",5,Super easy travel website By far the easiest travel website to find low cost hotel airline and rental car prices
2105,OrangeNumber9,"February 7, 2016",5,Great For Multi-City Flight Travel Love Kayak for multiple city with multiple airlines and the filters to narrow that complex array of options presentable. And it just keeps getting better every time I use it.
2106,Ryan Brow,"February 12, 2016",1,"Not great How kayak has the map feature set up makes it almost pointless. If you find a hotel in the location that you want on their map feature, you are not able to click on it and be redirected to the landing page with that hotel. They will only tell you the name. You must then go back and scroll through the entire list to find it."
2107,oreosmakemehappy,"February 13, 2016",1,"Trips function stopped working Used this app successfully for years. All of a sudden sometime between October2015 January 2016, the trips function stop working. When I go to my KAYAK account on the website all my upcoming trips are there but when I am using the app I try to update my trips and it always says download failed, and it only shows trips from October 2015 and prior."
2108,Ajb2222,"March 11, 2016",5,Go-to app I use this app all the time to check flights and sometimes cars. I don't use it for hotels. I wish Southwest was included but it's not their fault. It's one of the apps I use the most.
2109,CTRsurfer,"June 3, 2016",5,"My personal travel agent! Idk why everyone doesn't use kayak! My family and friends have been amazed for years by the killer air fare deals I find, and I always tell them I just use kayak!"
2110,Corey Michelle,"August 19, 2012",5,"Life-Saver This app really saved me when I had a flight cancelled and needed to find something quick and at the right price! Fast, easy to understand and great filters."
2111,Hear Ye11,"November 24, 2012",4,Excellent App The only thing I don't like about this app is that is doesn't give the city and of the airport stops when looking for fares. Change that feature and you get five stars. 
2112,peetssake,"December 27, 2012",5,"Hands down the best travel booking site Convenient, super fast loading, and intuitive interface.  The way all travel should be booked!"
2113,DivaMoni,"January 20, 2013",5,Best price! I always find the lowest price on kayak compare to all other cheap websites. Of course if time isn't an issue then Priceline is the place to go for another 40% discount.
2114,Ceattle light,"February 7, 2013",5,"#1 Best travel app I always search in Kayak when I need to book a flight, car rental or hotel. Easy access with info from all other sites as well."
2115,Kayak bites,"March 10, 2013",1,"They suk They don't not stand by their word. I book a room, went to check in and room was never booked and hotel was full. Called kayak they verified said they give me a full refund in 5-7 days and I would need to book a new room at a new hotel almost double the cost, I had to drive home at 12:30 am almost 2 1/2 hrs away cuz I was out of money and they did not care. Bottom line this company is horrible!!!!"
2116,Daniel Lieber,"May 21, 2013",5,Easy to use This is definitely the best go-to app for travel. Multiple sorting options and filters allow you to easily choose your priorities.
2117,LuckyDee_14,"May 30, 2013",5,"Always Reliable I can always rely on Kayak providing the best and lowest cost search results. It's so quick and easy to use, I can go through the booking process on my cellphone."
2118,Drink girl,"July 28, 2013",5,Excellent! I rarely write reviews for apps (if ever) but this app is extraordinary. It has an aesthetic layout and all of the information one would need when traveling. Definitely worthwhile to download.
2119,Matthew Pa,"March 19, 2014",5,"Easy, fast, and convenient! Kayak is simply the best way to search for all your vacation needs. All the airlines, except Southwest, are searched and organized however you'd like. Simply a great company and app."
2120,liTNus,"October 26, 2011",5,Kayak Perfect. No flaws whatsoever. UI operates more smoothly than most other apps. And the fact that it keeps EVERYTHING in one place is fantastic. I plan every trip I take with this app and TripAdvisor. Perfect combo for super-easy travel.
2121,KennectedIVCru,"November 17, 2011",5,"DL and Go! I downloaded the app, 10 minutes later I had a hella cheap hotel room for NYE. Compares all sites that deal with the travel plans you want to make and you pick who you wanna deal with. Thank you."

2124,Hawkeyeted,"December 22, 2011",5,"Finally! With the addition of My Trips, this is now the most useful app on both my iPhone and iPad.  I've been waiting over a year for this app to be what it is today.  Thanks team Kayak!"
2125,Wolf. Redmoon,"February 7, 2012",5,Very useful. This app is extremely useful. Great for frequent travelers like myself. The app allows you to book your flight and fill out everything right from your iPhone.
2126,VikasS,"March 20, 2012",5,"Great job by Kayak Thanks to Kayak for not tweaking their old dotCom style look-n-feel to give us an iPad app, but creating a true tablet style app, whic h exploits the apple GUI standards to hilt. I no longer use any other travel site for travel related searches."
2127,Alienware #1,"June 10, 2012",5,This site is sick!!!!! Travel never been so easy and good for all planes and international flights too!! Big Calander and times and filter is way better than other sites!!! It on my iPhone and ipad!!
2128,Wowchips,"June 26, 2012",5,Love this app! The best travel app out there!  My only complaint is sometimes there are better hacker fares on their actual website so you have to check both.
2129,Apaddict,"July 27, 2012",2,"Backing up is impossible!! What more can I say? This app has some major problems. Trying to get back to your fight if you click on seat selection, or any of the other links stops you in your tracks and you basically have to shut down the app and start new.  Finally after about an hour I got my flight back. Grrrr"
2130,RockyRoad37,"December 30, 2009",3,I use kayak on my PC regularly and like this iPhone app I have found kayak to be one of the best travel apps out there for comparing flights and hotels. I used the app for a trip to Denver this week and it worked flawlessly. I do wish it had the ability to search using multiple flight segments
2131,hiBrie,"January 28, 2010",5,"Best Travel App Available! Allows you to search flights, hotels, cars, etc. Breaks down flights by price, time, or distance. Wonderful app to have when looking into traveling!"

2135,dpfrz,"May 15, 2011",4,"Good but crashes a lot Like this more than any other travel app, but it crashes almost every time I use it. However when you start back up your info is still there, which is good."
2136,One Tequila two Tequila,"May 15, 2011",4,"Missing list of amenities button :-( The app is good but missing list of amenities. App does not provide any info on amenities for the hotels. For example can't tell the difference between pet friendly and not pet friendly hotels, breakfast included or not, and so on...."
2137,Rghinfll,"August 19, 2011",5,Love this app I have no complaints. I love this app and use it whenever I'm flying. Wish SW would come onboard and fearful Airtran will no longer be available with the acquisition. But none of that has to do with the app which is awesome.
2138,Rakoolbaby,"August 29, 2011",5,Better than website! It's been 3 days since I began using this app for flight tickets/price checks and I've to say that I find the app better than the website :)
2139,Kairaca,"September 10, 2011",5,"Awesome, Well Done! I've only ever given one other app 5 stars. It's app like this built by teams who believe in quality and serving their user. I especially like the way I can create easy price alerts."
2140,Talanasch,"October 25, 2016",5,I always book my flights with Kayak! I love Kayak; my only minor quibble is that I do not like being asked about adding hotel bookings and car rentals. I almost always stay with friends. :)

2145,jfrizzz,"March 13, 2017",3,"Vital Feature Needed I love being able to track flights and set up trips. However, flight tracking needs to add push notifications for status updates. SMS or email notifications are outdated, slower and just not good enough."

2152,FlyerYt,"February 18, 2016",4,"Easy to book! Great experience with booking flights and rental cars. Only con is that if you cancel a flight, your flight remains in your travel itinerary on the app until you manually cancel every flight."
2153,Chany27,"June 14, 2016",4,Good I like that it has the price alert and lists a lot of flights and prices. I would actually like to book through kayak instead of being transferred to another site though.

2160,Jmantle,"December 20, 2015",4,Does anyone exactly what it's suppose to Simple and easy to use. Would be nice if you could set filters each time you do a search.  Would also suggest not including Spirit since that airline is horrible
2161,Emily in Seattle,"December 22, 2015",5,Frequent flying Kayak is useful and always the first to be consulted when considering traveling not only in the states but also out of the country.

2171,Tara Gardo,"March 25, 2013",5,Great helpful App! Has a feature that tracks the cheapest time to book flights to destinations. If you are flexible and trying to figure out the best time of year to go places... It's very helpful!

2175,PE Haberman,"March 29, 2014",5,Super I travel internationally 3 times a year and I always rely on Kayak to provide me with the most affordable fares with the most flexibility. There are lots of websites offering similar services; nobody does a better a job than Kayak.

2177,JC loves to travel,"September 4, 2014",3,"App doesn't show accurate prices I like that it lets you save a trip and it will track changes, but there are flaws. The app will say that a fare is available and when it takes you to the travel site, the rate changes. So frustrating!"
2178,CateLarimer,"June 23, 2015",5,Really helpful Super easy compared to trying to use google or individual airline or hotel sites. Helps you use filters to find what you need!

2200,Faisal Laljee,"April 28, 2009",5,Great app! I am not sure why this app does not have a higher rating. It does exacty what it is supposed to. It finds you the cheapest airfares and let's you click off to the merchants site for purchase. I love it!
2201,BucknB2,"June 3, 2010",5,"Kayak Unstable Kayak constantly crashes and is therefore unusable at all. This is total junk. Kayak needs to have their heads examined to put out a piece of junk as this. Stick with their full web presence, which is an awesome tool."
2202,7902415763,"October 17, 2010",5,Nice! Does everything I need in one app. Froze a couple of times which I had to delete and reinstall to get it working again but still a great app overall.

2207,Lizhawk1,"May 29, 2017",5,Always Use Kayak First I especially like it for watching a route when I begin thinking about it. Very easy to use and to see the options.
2208,Ahumaydan,"May 31, 2017",4,Great app but... Can you bring back terminal maps for all airports? It used to be easy to browse through maps but the function seems hidden unless you have a trip booked
2209,jnauls,"July 12, 2017",2,"This app is buggy. The only good thing about this app is that it will present the total cost with taxes and all whereas most others will only show you the ticket price per person. Otherwise, the UX is very sloppy and it's full of bugs that affect the usability of the app overall. If you must use Kyak, I'd recommend using their (soon to be discontinued) Kyak Pro app."
2210,Meredithmcintosh,"February 21, 2016",5,Best travel app I use this daily via the widget in my notifications.  I have several flight price alerts for different destinations in order to monitor the prices. I love this app!
2211,Boogs2012,"February 21, 2016",5,Rpst Best travel app by far.  I have used Kayak for both domestic and international and never had one problem with any flight.  Could not recommend more highly.

2215,Burbs76,"June 23, 2016",4,Price in price alerts disappear When I create a price alert after a while the price disappears from the list. If I remove the alert and create it again the price starts to show up again.
2216,Kriggs4lyfe,"June 28, 2016",5,My Go to Travel Apps Forget all of the travel apps.... Kayak is the best ever. It is reliable and always provides me with the best air travel prices. Kayak gives you so many combinations to chose from.
2217,Wedding5500,"July 8, 2016",5,"Best Travel App I love Kayak!  It's easy to use, finds the best fares, sends me alerts when there's a change, and it's free!!  It got me to London last year for about $800 - beating every other app out there!  It's my go-to travel app!"
2218,Elyse in San Francisco,"July 14, 2016",5,Easy one-stop shopping for flights Also great for booking hotels. Fast and simple layout to got the info you need to plan a trip in very few clicks.

2220,beavis357,"December 23, 2015",5,Kayak rules Don use the other travel sites they take credit for the prices. When they aren't really doing anything for you
2221,Emveeh,"January 4, 2016",5,Booking I like the multi city booking option. Other booking sites/apps don't have that feature and this app is fairly easy to use.
2222,johnduke3,"January 18, 2016",5,"Easy and Quick to use Very easy to look up flights, plan, trips or just compare prices. Highly recommended."
2223,Dennis 92075,"January 23, 2016",5,Great travel App! There are a ton of travel apps competing however this one wins out as it is the one we always return after trying the others.
2224,mrkevinwright,"January 26, 2016",5,Great travel site! One of the best features of Kayak is a feature where they keep shopping rates and let you know when they find a lower price
2225,TexMex1976,"January 26, 2016",5,Works like a charm! Fantastic. My friends are always amazed at how I find some cheap flights so quickly. This is a great app. The best out of all the available travel apps that I've used!
2226,Sraveen's,"February 1, 2016",5,First Stop for Flight Booking My first place to look for my flight option. Easy to use and always gives the best price.
2227,Micah.E.Davis,"February 3, 2016",4,"Really incredible app! This app works really well, and it's really efficient at getting the best rates. My only problem with that is that ""trip"" feature doesn't automatically add stuff that you book on the app."
2228,pilot-dog,"February 17, 2016",5,I love the Kayak app Kayak is my go to price and flight finder no matter where I am in the world. It's also been my favorite and most used travel app. It's intuitive to use and never disappoints.

2230,jfamo,"January 25, 2013",5,"Useful Apart from the basic flight search option, I'm a huge fan of the currency converter, flight tracker and price alerts. One of the best travel apps I've used."
2231,seldon69,"February 8, 2013",5,"Easy way to get great deals Used kayak app to book 2 trips this year, already. Very easy to compare rates across websites and quickly book.  Great aggregation of reviews and ratings, as well."
2232,Dj ARKON,"February 14, 2013",1,Your app is whack! Your app has prices that are advertised that aren't accurate. I had 2 tickets confirmed and was on PayPal to purchase for $310. Kayak would not let me approve purchase because they wanted me to buy flight insurance that I hit No Thanks on. Then the prices go up from $310 to $470 while I keep hitting No thanks on Insurance. I am deleting this app & going back to cheap tickets for my travels. Kayak is a disorganized Waste of time & energy
2233,אבי774,"March 12, 2013",2,"Poor. Very poor I was in a hurry to reschedule a flight due to bad weather. I entered the date and destination but got many other dates, beyond my desired one. I accidentally chose the wrong date and now I'm stuck with a wrong ticket. If only Kayak app had the option to select EXACT DATES ONLY, I wouldn't have been in this mess. Thanks for nothing Kayak, thanks a lot!"
2234,Cl@udi@ ;),"April 30, 2013",5,"I love it! Great app, easy to access and never fails. Best website ever, it gives me the best value for everything. With these prices it feels like I can travel at least once a month :D"
2235,Alex1234art,"March 4, 2014",4,"Good application but it does not have all the airlines The application works well on OW and RT flights, although it lacks many airlines, especially budget. On multiple stops it can get tricky and you are better off researching on your own"
2236,Papito2305,"April 1, 2014",5,Highly recommend A must have for the constant traveler or set on going on vacation. This app will definitely assist you in all aspects of booking and reserving the best price available. Get now!!
2237,Bridgette Keye,"April 29, 2014",5,"Has everything you need. It's got a feature for every part of a trip. Car, flight, hotel? Got it. Premade checklists? Got it. Overview of the airport you're going to be in? Got it. I'm amazed."
2238,mags8407,"June 1, 2015",2,App won't load fares I love kayak but I can not get fare results to load on this app. It just spins and spins. I thought maybe it was my phone service but then tried the same search on the Chrome app and the results loaded immediately. This happened the last time I tried searching flights a few weeks ago. Not great.
2239,SamAshW,"December 20, 2015",5,Love the price alerts Wish the app had package options so that I didn't have to use the regular website but that's my only complaint.

2253,Laurg,"December 31, 2011",5,"Awesome I still check all the other travel websites when looking for a flight but kayak always has the cheapest prices and, most importantly, the most comprehensive arch layout!"
2254,Ezir ny,"January 5, 2012",4,"I love it, almost perfect yet the best It's the greatest cheap flight search engine and trustable. However, adding a button that may search the cheapest flight in a year will make it perfect. Whatever it is, i will stick to using this great software!!!"
2255,Di5avowed,"January 8, 2012",4,Could be better Great app and ESP for flight tracking HOWEVER this app is used internationally so get rid of the USA states in auto fill
2256,Elephant99,"January 18, 2012",5,"Very Useful App Kayak is a real time saving planning tool.   I always check Kayak before booking reservations, and before heading to the airport to pick up arriving guests. I love being able to follow flights in real time."

2260,Catanopr,"September 1, 2009",1,"Such a shame! I downloaded the app and did a search and it was showing several different options and prices while the search was progressing but once the search was completed the page said no results found. However, at the bottom of the screen it said showing 464 of 464 results. Too bad! This could be a really good app if it didn't have this bug."

2279,johninspanish,"May 16, 2017",1,"App auto searches for hotels Kayak has been forcing auto hotel-searches as soon as I launch the app. You have to wait for the hotel search to complete before you can start your actual search. I imagine this must help their ad sales team show people are using it for hotel searches. However, it is making me want to switch to a different travel app."

2287,M. Mitchell,"September 5, 2016",4,My Go-To Travel Site The app makes it easy to comparison shop. You can even book trips if so inclined. It would be THE travel app if it were easier for users to write reviews and/or share photos.

2295,Hogtied1478543,"February 21, 2016",5,Best travel app This is by far the best travel app! I am a skeptic and have used others to try to compare prices. Kayak always has the best prices and the usability of the app always keeps me satisfied.

Just for curiosities sake I went directly to the Kayak website and found that prices were 20% less on the website when searching at the exact same time (I took pictures to back this up). Why use an app that's going to show you a higher price when your searching for the lowest?
2397,musicinmybrain,"December 19, 2015",5,"Useful, clean, and stable There’s a common pattern where major companies’ useful apps get redesigned into bloated, crashy uselesness.

2451,Use The Kayak Website,"July 21, 2013",1,Less Efficient Than Website Missing functionality of the website. Primarily it won't search prices for nearby airports and won't search for flights with flexible dates (+/- 3 days). It also doesn't provide the price trend.

2469,Royalsherman,"May 29, 2013",4,Must Have for any business traveler This is better than trip it as I've used that before with many issues. Kayak is streamless and causes me so much less headache as I travel 12 days out of the month on average.

2476,Kootzinthegame,"January 15, 2012",5,"My Favorite Travel App I fly about twice a month and I can't live without this app now. I used to use TripIt and they wanted to charge for the same features Kayak offers free. Great app, no bugs."

2484,Ripped Monkey,"July 19, 2011",5,All-In-One •Kayak is a powerful one-stop-shop app.
2485,MsPhyitness,"July 21, 2011",5,Awesome and easy to use  App! Straight forward and very easy to navigate! Almost easier than the website IMHO. Highly recommend you give it a try!
2486,ParisBoundBritt,"July 23, 2011",4,"Pretty Darn Good I've been using this app to set up a trip to Paris for this September. Searching for a flight and booking it was soo super easy.

2490,Mayday Mayday,"August 5, 2009",3,Pet Friendly Hotel Search Although listings show whether pets are allowed it would be awesome if we could conduct a search for pet friendly hotels instead of having to click one by one. Needs more criteria search options. Please consider for future updates. Wag wag!
2491,Mkinsfl,"August 23, 2009",5,Found my flight! Been looking every day for weeks to find a lower fare. Was out of the office and decided to check. And there it was. One single seat left. Thanks!
2492,Retrovibe,"May 29, 2010",5,"Superb Production Really well done. I have been disappointed that United Airlines hasn't released an iPhone app, until I discovered all the tools in the Kayak app. Now I no longer need them to - This thing is sweet!"
2493,Andycr17,"September 25, 2010",5,One of best travel apps! And it's free!
2494,Salsaphile,"September 30, 2010",3,"New functionality, new bugs The new functionality is good but the new version also introduced a bug where you cannot search for flights to nearby airports. As a result flight search does not have as many options as the ITA software travel app (OnTheFly)."
2495,citizenworld,"November 16, 2010",5,Prefer it over the desktop version! Almost... But it is a great app and the only thing I use to search for flights from my iPhone. It's fast and flexible
2496,Steve0000000,"March 15, 2017",5,Easy an dependable Been using Kayak for many years. It's one of the few that retains its simplicity through many updates. Five stars!

2498,TrainsBoston,"July 5, 2017",1,Current version is unusable I used to love using Kayak but this most recent update crashes continuously when trying to use the date feature including trying to change a date on a search. I agree with the prior reviewers that due to the bugs in the current version I'm not using

2501,525751135,"November 6, 2016",4,Easy to use Quick way to compare hotel rates. I've found the prices are generally lower than other sites. I like how the actual number of the hotel is listed.
2502,Tayfungny,"November 13, 2016",5,Great 🎃 It's great app i can use this every time when I need. But it needs an update. Because in Turkey it shows flight times 1 hour forward.

2505,Denvergirl1955,"January 16, 2017",4,Helpful app Good app to get general idea of flights and hotels. Not all airlines participate so still need to check individual sites. Appreciate the flight notification feature to alert when fares change.
2506,Aa1847391,"January 20, 2017",4,Love kayak Kayak is my favorite resource for finding cheap flights by searching multiple days and airports at the same time. The app is fine but the desktop has even more options.

2534,CurlerMan,"February 5, 2015",1,"Packing List Gone!? No more packing list!?  I had all my various types of trips saved in this app and relied on the packing list for every one (fishing, business, leisure, hunting, etc.). Now it appears they're all lost. What a simple feature to retain, and for some reason Kayak chose to get rid of it. What a bonehead move. "
2535,Jawelsh08,"February 11, 2015",1,If I could give zero I would We selected a room for 4 people and after we gave our cc# kayak kicked us over to Priceline and stuck us into a room with 1 king bed.  How are we supposed to fit 4 of us into 1 king bed?  Called the hotel and they refused to switch us even if we paid the difference.  So we are stuck with this 1 bed and we are dissatisfied customers.  Will not use again.

2541,Iinjama,"December 28, 2012",2,No offline for trips Still can't believe the trips screen doesn't store your data and instead requires an internet connection... Totally stupid and makes it worthless for travel.
2542,PancakeSammich,"January 18, 2013",2,"Slow, flawed, not worth the space it takes I've uninstalled and reinstalled this app several times hoping for improvement and no such luck. It is extremely slow and glitchy. I think I've only managed to complete a search or two without an error."

It only updated to display the correct information after the alleged arrival time had passed. Disgraceful."

2560,Amanda Burgess,"January 9, 2012",1,"Awesome idea. Crashes every time I use it. The interface looks awesome, it's very accessible and easy to use, but the app crashes after every search. I can get as far as seeing the lowest rate- but if I try to scroll through the list, the app  shuts down. It's like having a huge amazing trampoline with really worn out springs. Jump all you want, this apps got nothin (til the bugs are worked out)."
2561,Ultra Orange,"January 10, 2012",4,Great set of tools Lots of great features and tools for the traveller. Could be a little bit faster but it is faster than some other travel apps. It's free and has a flight tracker and simple guides if you plan on traveling get this app

2581,MoBook Traveler,"May 5, 2010",3,Useful but too slow and cumbersome I like the basic premise that Kayak brings to the table but I simply don't have the time to waste booking on multiple sites.  I find the entire process slow and a bit cumbersome. But the app is useful for those that have the time.
2582,Digster79,"June 28, 2010",3,"Please include package deals While this app is very cool and I love the ease and search capabilities, I'd totally give this app 5 stars if only they would include package options.

2590,Dwp1975,"November 29, 2016",5,"Go to travel app Love this app, been using it even before it was a app. Kayak is always my go to for finding tickets and hotels. 90% of the time I get the best prices here."
2591,Eturtle25,"December 29, 2016",5,Love this app It's the only app I use for all my travels. It's easy to use and always has the best prices. Have never had a bad experience like with other travel apps.
2592,Lbeckatx,"January 24, 2017",5,"Great app. Easy to use. Use it all the time. Wish it had all the features the website does, but I understand why it can't."
2593,TheBeholder1,"January 28, 2017",5,Better prices than Google Flights Better prices than Google Flights because it includes more airlines and more hacker fares.
2594,Hayloader,"March 6, 2017",5,Great App!! Have used this app for over 2 years now and have cross-compared many times to other platforms.......I get the best rates consistently.  Very easy to use and largely trouble-free.
2595,Baybugz,"March 24, 2017",5,Loving it so far So far so good!  Like that I can track potential flights a few months out and save many options!
2596,LonelyDriver!,"April 5, 2017",5,Great way to save. I dont fly a lot but with this app i was able to find something whenever i had free time. Pretty easy to use and fast.
2597,Fv transplant,"April 5, 2017",5,Great app!! So useful when planning a trip or renting a car - have used the app more often than going on the website! Thanks :)

2599,Cmor911,"May 26, 2017",5,My go to flight app! This is my go to flight now. Been using it for five years. And it's always been reliable and consistent.
2600,Pondlot,"February 15, 2016",4,"Good not great I generally use Kayak to find out who goes where and when, and it is quite good.  But it misses some carriers - as an example JetBlue. So I use it a quick indication of how to search deeper."
2601,Hart0808,"February 18, 2016",5,"Excellent app I travel for work 80%.  This app is the best. I use it for myself for comparative shopping or to quickly make a recommendation to traveling family, friends&colleagues. "
2602,Asavare,"April 24, 2016",5,"Love the website, love the app The app is effortless to use, intuitive, well-designed. Just as easy as the website. Highly recommend!"
2603,ThatGirl24,"May 27, 2016",5,"So easy and uncluttered! I love how you can select a specific date, but have the option to look for flights +/- 1 to 3 days"
2604,Nibinpsan,"June 8, 2016",5,Relatable and one stop shopping I love using kayak... That's the first place I go to see how the rates for flights hotels and car are for my travel dates.. Highly recommended
2605,Gamesi,"July 18, 2016",5,"Excellent App No need to look elsewhere, it has been a breeze putting in filters and searching to find vacation deals!"
2606,Heslopdakid,"August 12, 2016",5,Useful I like it because it allows me to search for flights and flight combinations that I do not get from other apps.
2607,troups,"September 2, 2016",5,Solid app - does everything Highly recommend. Does (almost) everything you can do on desktop. Love it.
2608,Biso1981,"September 17, 2016",5,"5-star for... I'm at the terminal, waiting my flight's boarding. Suddenly I got a notification from Kayak informing me of my flight's delay. After 15min, the passengers were informed officially of this delay. Thanks, Kayak"
2609,Marynoelle,"November 16, 2016",5,"Easy and fastest way to find the best price Kayak is the only travel app I use now, it's the fastest way to find the best fare, checking all the popular travel sites at once."
2610,The_Austrian,"December 19, 2015",4,"Great app, but latest update buggy Latest update crashes constantly when trying to change flight information. 6+ iOS 9.2"
2611,SPG Cardholder,"December 27, 2015",5,Cheap flights - quick comparisons I LOVE this app and website. Quick comparison of dozens of airlines. As avid travelers we have found amazing flight deals through this app!
2612,Calebmuia,"January 1, 2016",5,Keep up the awesome work! Good work. Your app is easy to use and the fare prices are competitive if not better than the deals on the airline sites and apps.
2613,Buzz4615,"January 10, 2016",5,Easy way to find travel It is an easy way to look at travel alternatives. Highly recommend.

2617,Kiki Loveland,"February 7, 2016",3,"Not so easy when you get the oops Pro-amazingly easy to get around, finding air tickets, hotels and cars..., except when "
2618,Brettmdavis,"February 9, 2016",4,Great functionality Great job! Perhaps offer an options for travelers that want to get away and only care about price. So the user selects dates and departure airport and then Kayak lists the best flights to anywhere within their budget!
2619,BearsDad,"February 10, 2016",5,A valuable app I like Kayak because it provides you with a consolidated data base which is constantly updated. The notifications are spot on.
2620,Base12WArmy,"January 26, 2014",5,"Best traveling app Very useful, and it always finds a good price for me. Whenever I get back from a deployment I'll know where to go to get a decent ticket to go back home. Thank you Kayak."
2621,fuschia_frankie,"February 19, 2014",5,Great on the go! I use it when I am traveling to see rates on local hotels and to book last minute flights. It also finds the cheapest rental cars!
2622,MomGRNMT,"March 12, 2014",3,Other apps better for hotels I like kayak for flights and car rentals but the hotel feature does not allow for pet friendly search therefore making it rather useless for those of us who travel with our fur babies
2623,Tic TicTicTic,"October 17, 2014",5,Great for frequent travelers and for everyone It's a great all around app for flight bookings and flight schedule checking. Hotels and car rentals are also included.
2624,pommier75,"October 22, 2014",5,Bring back the old version Hate the new version.  Much more cumbersome and less flexible the the old HD version.  Cannot arrange the airline results alphabetically by airline.
2625,Apple official one,"November 2, 2014",5,For the travelers It's a must have app for anyone who travels at least once a year. I learned kayak has the best price than any other website and it's easy to use.
2626,Liventsllc,"December 2, 2014",3,Did not load pass seat page Not sure if it needs strong wifi or what. But it didn't load past the seat page. I logged onto their website instead to book. It was no problem.
2627,J Jr.,"December 3, 2014",5,"Great app! Simple, works well, and has an easy to understand UI. If you want to book a flight or hotel room or anything, use this app."
2628,MsTyannaLove,"March 2, 2015",5,Great Booking It was super easy to book a flight for my husband and brothers business trip. And it made it easy to verify I was getting the best price on the tickets.
2629,Consejeroso,"March 7, 2015",4,"Almost like the website Just like the website except for the ability to filter by airlines or by network of airlines.  Fast, solid, and gives clear results."
2630,MichyForte,"March 30, 2013",5,Easy I love this app. So easy to use and it makes finding flights readily accessible and even book them through app!
2631,Bigtrav87,"April 1, 2013",5,Kayak A very good app. The load times are very fast plus the prices are just like on the website. Definitely a must have app if you travel.
2632,jadozier,"April 11, 2013",4,"Great Easy to navigate. Gives a lot of options. Only problem is no option to include number of children in search. Other than that, love it."
2633,chombajr,"June 10, 2013",4,"Very solid app - easy to use Intuitive interface, very easy to use.  I like that it gives you multiple booking site options rather than forcing you to use Kayak's site."
2634,Maria Cristina Laura,"June 19, 2013",5,"Great App Very fast, efficient and reliable. I've been using this site for years with great results."
2635,Traveler_az,"July 6, 2013",5,SPG gold; SVO elite; MPG elite Love kayak's app! Whether I am booking something or just exploring prices and options I always start with a search on Kayak to get the landscape of prices and options. Thanks for the very functional app
2636,Artemaria,"July 14, 2013",5,"Great Travel App If you are going to have just one travel app, this is a good one to have.  Very easy to use and produces quick results.  Highly recommended."
2637,Alaskaaaaa,"July 16, 2013",5,"Rate I love how it shows all the different prices from cheapest to expensive. I highly recommend this app, much cheaper than anywhere else!"
2638,RooFace,"July 24, 2013",5,"One stop shop It's not perfect but they're always improving. Overall, an excellent app. I wouldn't search for flights any other way!"

2645,4feat,"January 4, 2013",5,Slick Travel App Great app. I've use the website for years and now I see this is a slick application to check quick travel information.
2646,Travel 614,"January 31, 2013",5,Frequent Travel Very organized and quick way to find cheap flights with many different schedules
2647,Martyk74,"February 13, 2013",5,Just as good as full website Quick and easy to navigate. I prefer the app to the full website. Highly useful!
2648,mountain_exposure,"March 11, 2013",4,So far works well The iPad version is easier to book with. The iPhone version doesn't take you to a mobile version of some hotel booking pages so scroll scroll... Love it if my AAA # could be stored.
2649,Kikaykath,"March 25, 2013",5,Thanks Just booked ticket from kayak love this app so easy to use and has very affordable tickets than others. Thank you KAYAK for making our travelseasy and faster to purchase 👍👍👍👍
2650,Bailey Hosking,"January 30, 2012",5,Very good app!!! I used it to plan my vacation to wendover but it doesn't the peppermill hotels but neither does any other travel websites so it's ok I got a cheap flight and car use it to go on the salt flats a good time!
2651,Asugirl290900,"January 31, 2012",5,Kayak app This app is a fully comprehensive travel app which allows the user to maneuver from one menu to another with ease. Very pleased with this app and feel its the best travel app on the market.
2652,GadgetQueer,"February 7, 2012",4,"Pretty useful Got this app 4 months ago. Works pretty well. Easy-to-use interface, lots of customization. It would be nice if the available flights gave an on-time comparison like Expedia, but that's a minor thing."
2653,Nurse_independent,"February 20, 2012",5,"Great airfare app I've used kayak for all my flights and it always gives me the cheapest prices  It's super easy to use and really helpful in comparing airlines, dates, times. Highly recommend !"
2654,HRGator,"March 17, 2012",5,"Best overall travel app Sometimes I go to Google ITA matrix software when I need a lot of details, but Kayak is generally where I go first for all travel information.  Great app, great company.  Big fan of Kayak!"
2655,Kevmcs,"March 30, 2012",5,"Powerful All the features you need, most times better the their web site"
2656,AnazingAlee,"April 16, 2012",5,"Best Travel App Easy to use Travel App, even easier then the desktop website. Found my flights fast. No complaints."
2657,Tejdhawan,"April 30, 2012",5,"Fantastic app I've used apps from Orbitz, United, Priceline and others but all pale in comparison to Kayak. A truly stunning application that's a pleasure to use and doesn't appear to be slanted to one airline over another."
2658,JrSant,"May 29, 2012",5,Interface This just may be the best interface of any app I've had. It really increases the frequency of my visits and my likelihood of using Kayak vs other similar services on my phone.
2659,refju,"July 26, 2012",5,"User friendly! My quality of life remains just fine, thanks to NOT having had to cold call/search online hotel accommodations. Thank you!"
2660,Phritz20,"October 12, 2010",5,Good app - sometimes crashes I go to this app for all my travel planning. I just wish it wouldn't crash. It doesn't do it too frequently.
2661,mstinad,"June 14, 2011",4," kayak is great but today is the first day it's been buggy. haven't been able to look up flights for the past few hours. update the bugs please! other than that, I love it!"
2662,AndrésMeLadies,"June 30, 2011",4,Easy to use & convenient Very easy to use and extremely clear interface that gives you all that you need. Even can book multi city trips in an easy format!
2663,Mae Kelly,"July 1, 2011",5,Great app This a great app if your a person who has to travel half way across the us to see family and friends this is 4 u it's fast and they show great prices I love it
2664,Ryan Zawistoski,"October 23, 2011",5,"Has what other booking apps are missing! Highly functional, efficient, eliminates the need for a computer in booking a trip-"
2665,AE420BP,"November 11, 2011",5,"Excellent trip planner Just for checking out prices and destinations, it is well worth it. Being able to book you flight, room, and vehicle, awesome."
2666,ttorrens,"December 9, 2011",5,"Awesome app! I really couldn't think of any enhancements!  I rarely encounter an app where every feature i think of ends being there!  Great UI, so intuitive, serious kudos to you guys."
2667,Go Row Go,"December 20, 2011",5,Great job! There was a good selection of hotels to choose from and there were no extra charges. Will use them again.
2668,JennMurph,"December 28, 2011",5,"Fantastic! This is, by far, the best travel app. Every aspect was well thought out, programmed, and smart. I love the flight tracker option. Highly recommend for anyone!"
2669,New to CA,"January 17, 2012",5,Great! Sometimes shows different fares than website. Also this is limited by screen size as I love the flex dates table you get on the full site.
2670,Nonet4u,"October 21, 2009",4,When it's good it's very very good ... When the app doesn't crash - it's wonderful. I prefer Kayak over the purchased app that I was using to find flights. Too bad I found this after purchasing a flight search app.
2671,Mexico Magico,"December 9, 2009",2,"Oversimplified - Cannot Specify Needs Too simple, lacks search options. Cannot specify class in airline search, quality or neighborhood in hotel search. For example Mexico city (20 million people, bigger than some countries) returns thousands of results, pointless!!! Too bad because the GUI and speed of search is tops in the field."
2672,tobuadantoq,"October 2, 2010",4,Flight Info Flight Status is covered with gray and something I can't see after the status refresh. 
2673,SmoothPos(t)er,"March 19, 2017",5,Great app Love that it  an save flights for me as I research other options. Filters are great for quickly narrowing down results. Haven't booked with them yet but it's a great research tool.
2674,E.M. Punk,"March 23, 2017",5,"Best Travel App There Is This is by far the easiest and most useful travel app that I've ever used.  I'm on the go frequently, so I use this app often.  Very useful and quick!"
2675,MapperJim,"April 30, 2017",5,"Always the best price finder I've been a Kayak user for many, many years. They have always provided the best options and pricing for travel."
2676,Coldplay9gag,"April 30, 2017",4,"Good app, but I liked it before when a lot more features were available without signing in Such as saved trips or recent searches."
2677,Skuchame,"May 18, 2017",5,Best travel app ever!!! The best feature of this travel app is the fact that you can search for the best price in a seven day period. The price alerts are also a great future.
2678,Chadro3,"July 2, 2017",4,"Non-Responsive New version is often non-responsive when trying to select dates only 4-months in advance. Otherwise, I've enjoyed this app for researching and booking travel."
2679,Commute inATL,"July 25, 2017",5,Searching for flights is easy! I love the search capability and the ease of setting up alerts! Multi-city searches are super easy and very helpful too.
2680,KapilFlyer,"September 14, 2016",5,"Best! Precise! Easy! My Favorite! This website is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!  I use a lot of different websites but Kayak is simply amazing!! The way it presents it's search results is a work of art! It's informative, concise and to the point! Great search & saves $$$. "
2681,Mikejgr111820,"September 25, 2016",5,Great App What a great app to help in booking any trip. Use friendly and will help to save a boat load of money the next time you venture out. Highly recommend.
2682,Chiro70,"October 19, 2016",5,Best app to find flights Kayak is the best app to find the flights I am looking for. You can find the cheapest or the best flight based on landing or take off times very easy with Kayak!
2683,Audiocage,"December 23, 2016",5,Love it. Very reliable. I travel quite a bit and have used kayak for a number of years and find it very reliable and convenient.
2684,Rich84663,"January 4, 2017",5,Extremely useful travel app I love using this application to find hotels in advance or at the last minute. It is very useful and I'm glad I have it.
2685,Lazyd33,"January 5, 2017",5,Flight duration default option please Awesome app.  How about an option to default look for shortest DURATION? I have to change it everytime i look.
2686,idoitunes,"January 15, 2017",3,"Love the Desktop Site - App is improving When the App adds all the possibilities like the desktop site (trains, cruises, etc.) I will give it a 5 for sure.  Desktop site gets a 5-star rating for sure.  Definitely shows cheapest trips - beats CheapoAir every single time I compare."
2687,gtucker1984,"January 20, 2017",5,Great tool for booking I enjoy the ease of setting up alerts. The prices are very competitive as the app will also reference me to the best flights available.
2688,Novicioso,"February 26, 2017",2,"DON'T BOTHER Booking hotels repeatedly fails with no explanation except that the ""booking failed"". Not worth typing in all your info only to come up empty. "
2689,Liliwms,"March 14, 2017",5,Love this app It's the go to app for booking your tickets.  I use it all the time when I have to get tickets for either me or my family.
2690,Daddy yum yum,"March 1, 2016",5,"Great APP Can't count how many times I've used Kayak to find a flight, hotel, or car. It's very dependable and searches through a wide variety of sources."
2691,AeHDmH,"March 4, 2016",5,"Excellent for Business travelers! This, along with Southwests App, are essential for my 50+ annual flights.  I have been using Kayak for years and this app makes it even easier!"
2692,javahead123,"May 26, 2016",5,Everything you need in one place I especially like the flight tracker interface.
2693,trainer54321,"June 27, 2016",5,Love Kayak! I've been using KAYAK for three or four years now. I find it to be a great place to start when searching for the lowest airfares. I recommend it highly!
2694,JoshKay,"August 5, 2016",5,A must have for the avid traveler We are constantly on the road and this app helps find local hotels wherever we are! Also gives great airfare rates!
2695,Rosethorns03,"August 7, 2016",5,Perfect for road trips Been using this app the entire time and have gotten great deals. I like that you can see a map view.
2696,Wandering Spectator,"August 20, 2016",5,Easy way to keep an eye on prices I like that you can check all airlines in one step. Filters make it easy to get the right times.
2697,Nixknne that usnt taken,"August 30, 2016",3,"Website still better than app Needs to incorporate multi-day functionality better. Also, when I want morning arrivals only I sometimes get morning arrivals for the next day as well, usually with some massive overnight layover"
2698,SurfAndTravel,"September 5, 2016",5,Great App Accurate pricing and easy to use interface. Was able to get a cheap flight to Costa Rica using kayak. Would definitely recommend.
2699,pinayATL,"September 8, 2016",5,"Only travel app I need This is the only app I use or need.  Great extensive features, great reliability. You can really find the best rates according to the specific parameters you choose."
2700,DoozerStick,"December 23, 2015",4,"Super easy and convenient Makes it very easy to track flights and strike when the iron is hot on good deals. Has the same airline carrier limitations as the website, thus 4 stars instead of 5 (I am a big Southwest guy)."
2701,97Keys,"December 29, 2015",5,"Best travel app! I always depend on Kayak to give me notifications on fares, rentals, or hotels. I wait until they notify me that the flight, rental, or hotel are at or below my budget. Then buy."
2702,Malibres88,"January 13, 2016",5,Great! Easy to use and clean interface Highly recommended to find your flights. Haven't used it for anything else.
2703,Phillyhontas,"January 15, 2016",5,Great app!! My first time to use it so we'll see. I've been using Expedia for far too long. This is like a breath of fresh air. I've read good reviews about this and so far I'm loving it.
2704,rpc102,"January 19, 2016",5,Great way to find travel This app is easy to use and very flexible so you can get a lot of information to help make better decisions
2705,JFG Builders,"January 22, 2016",5,Wonderful!!! Wouldn't travel without this app. Period. I fly 20 times a year and stay at hotels more than half of the year. This is the only app to use.
2706,HeatStroked,"January 30, 2016",5,"Love it! When I research, I always start here for airline tickets. Kayak is usually right on. It represents ticket prices out there. I use this in addition to other airlines websites that Kayak does not cover."
2707,daltonthefloor,"February 12, 2016",5,"Kayak works magic Kayak makes travel and trips super easy, I use kayak every month and can always count on the app or site to find the best deals."
2708,DGreeneATL,"February 18, 2016",4,"Go to App for Travel Fares on the Go,... In the airport, in the car, traveling cross-country, near and far,... last minute, cancelled flight, need a place to stay, just for the night? Kayak on my mobile has been alright!"

2710,Dimples128,"July 28, 2014",5,Great way to check fares I travel a lot for business and pleasure so it's important to get the best fare for the times I am looking at. The app is easy to use and very quick.
2711,Aquarium princess,"December 26, 2014",5,"Best Comparison App This app is by far the best at comparing reviews across the internet and making it easily accessible. Have used Kayak online as well and just as great. Definitely download, it's free!"
2712,DLebo,"December 27, 2014",5,"Seriously love this app They have all the right filters and exactly what you need to plan a trip! Ads aren't intrusive at all, so go with the free version of the app, it's amazing!"
2713,Kcluprrp,"January 3, 2015",5,"Excellent I haven't really used ALL the features this app has to offer, but it has helped me straight away. Great navigation and easy to understand."
2714,RD-Sea,"January 16, 2015",3,"Last Update Broke App Not sure if others are having this issue, but it appears the most recent update broke this app on my iPad Air running IOS 8.1.2. When I launch Kayak, the screen has colored panels, but no visible text or buttons. And there's no touch response."
2715,Rusty504,"February 11, 2015",1,WHERE ARE MY PACKING LISTS!?!? Packing lists were probably my favorite feature of this app. I often told other people to download the app just for this feature!
2716,Beckham_g7,"March 19, 2015",5,Was perfect until they removed the packing list without informing us !! Where is the packing list !!! Deleted without notification!!
2717,ntobey87,"March 26, 2015",5,Best App I love the explore feature on this app I am constantly looking for new places to explore for a small budget. I found round trip tickets from Chicago to DC for $78! Can't beat that!
2718,Bellejulz,"July 7, 2015",5,Great app! Allows for multi-city search; gives travel time frames; filters for flight stops options
2719,Chieftain Mk3,"October 31, 2015",1,"Does not work! Love Kayak but it has become useless, when they route you to the major airlines, they won't accept your credit cards and Kayak's own credit card processing simply doesn't work. If you go to the airline or hotel website, they work fine. Kayak is a great UI and was a huge time saver but has now become nearly useless for booking travel."

2721,Smsnow1,"May 6, 2013",4,"Simple app Simple and fairly useful. Obviously if you want to do a lot of research, you will need to go further than this app allows. My only complaint is that they don't have lempiras in their current converter!"

2725,GW802,"August 31, 2013",5,Love this app My favorite app for looking up flight options. Very helpful when stuck in an airport and needing to change plans. Works fast for me.
2726,Slosjf,"September 24, 2013",1,"Needs help I used to love this app, this new version crashes every time you try to filter your airfare search results. Also I really like the way it saved your searches for airfare so you could quickly run through your list of searches, now that feature is gone. If it doesn't come back I'll be using a different app for my travel searches."

Ex: Firsr searched Chicago to Cancun and looked at results. Went back to search page and updated cities to search for flights from Chicago to Miami. But Search results on the next page still show results for Chicago to Cancun. This app is unusable in its current state!"

Three hours later, I went to buy the tickets and the price was triple what the app had said. I didn't even create a new search, I just refreshed the listings. Clearly the app has some major issue, definitely odidn't work for me."

2740,JeremyLat.,"January 26, 2012",1,"Why Change? I don't understand why the change to this new app. All the space on the iPad screen and you can't set the dates without having to bounce back and forth between screens?! The ""old"" app let you do everything right from one screen. Old app was easy and quite honestly, fun to use. This new one stinks. Update the interface back to the old style!"
2741,Gramevloen,"February 19, 2012",5,A truly dazzling app Need to trawl the many terrible airline websites looking for a decent price? There's and app for that and look no further than Kayak. Probably one of the best IOS apps out there.

2847,Steveu16,"July 8, 2017",2,Sneaky app I do not appreciate that the recommendation to buy or wait shows up well before the lowest priced options show up... you just have to keep waiting and hope the app is done searching or you might inadvertently assume the top listing is the lowest price when kayak is not done searching yet.

2925,LettingItGo,"July 16, 2011",5,Love it. It's intuitive and simple. The best part is that Kayak reports REAL prices - no super low prices advertised with hidden costs added when you go to make reservations.

3022,Motlearsi,"December 1, 2010",2,Horrible prices The prices you get on the app are not consistent with the prices on kayak's main site! Having to check the website on a desktop machine makes this app superfluous. The prices on here are high by several hundred dollars and are basically a tax on the lazy and those without access to a computer.

3286,Reeeeeeview,"January 19, 2014",5,Good app Easily search flights and hotels. Easier to sift through options online but app still works great!
3287,Amit_rosenberg,"March 5, 2014",4,Very user friendly. Hope they can add the +\- 3 days option Hope they add the +/-3 days option similar to the website. Other than that - great!
3288,Momandwife2014,"March 16, 2014",5,Awesome! Our family travels often and this app provides us with the information we need!
3289,Maria109,"June 23, 2014",5,"Great App! I have not yet booked with Kayak, but the app itself is great! It is easy to use and clear to understand. It really helps in the trip planning process."
3290,Wax-it,"November 4, 2012",5,"Great App!! It's a great app to have when you are looking for a good price on a flight, hotel, or rental car!! It's easy to navigate through, also!!"
3291,GlobeWanderer7,"November 30, 2012",5,Very useful Great app. Sometimes the itineraries don't make total sense. Also need a way to modify a trip after it has been sent to My Trips.
3292,Ninja Augustine,"February 21, 2013",5,The worst website This website customer service does NOT help the travelers or customer and just stand from the company. No good.
3293,Sammia07,"February 24, 2013",5,Love this site! I always turn to kayak first when looking for flights. It always seems to have the best price.
3294,WiscoP-funk,"March 2, 2013",3,"Kayak-iztan The app is not as friendly as the regular site. Price alerts are sporadic at updating prices, hacker fares don't exist on the mobile app, a lot of extra steps to check flights +/- 1day.  The app is better than some others but far from superior."
3295,Syngen49,"March 5, 2013",5,One of the best apps on my phone! I use this app every day to figure out the best and lowest cost ways of getting from there to where.
3296,Trip finder,"March 15, 2013",5,Awesome app. This app. Is very useful and great. It helped me plan where to stay for my vacation. And also what attractions were near. I recommend it for any body planning a trip. Great app. :)
3297,Riwaj,"April 20, 2013",4,"Kayak! It is subsequently a good app but the only thing that could be missing in this app is a monthly fare calendar. If Kayak included that here, it would've been a great travel booking app in the whole iOS store."
3298,Yigal A,"April 23, 2013",5,It helps a lot when you on the road Kayak works perfect on my iPad and on my IPhone. It is very easy to use and should be used by any traveler

3300,Seba_EE,"May 25, 2012",5,Very handy Needs to improve the layout a bit but when it comes to booking on the go .... The kayak app is the best way to do it
3301,Csyyd,"May 30, 2012",4,"I miss the FF program filter Nice app. I assume because of space certain filters aren't available. Only +/- 2 days filter (not 3), and no filter for FF programs... My favorite feature on the Kayak site. Other than that, app works great!"
3302,Gnarldan05,"June 24, 2012",1,"Constantly crashes, listed airfare often not available Horrible App. Crashes everytime you click on a hotel listing and try to do something like look at photos.  50/50 chance that Kayak's airfare is correct - half the time when you find a fare and click to book, the Kayak listed fare is no longer available."
3303,Diva615,"July 23, 2012",5,"Wonderful app I love this app, especially in the summer time when I'm always traveling. Everything is now right at your finger tips."

3331,Canlapan i tunes,"November 29, 2009",2,"Limited search It won't let me search anymore because I exceeded my search allowance. It is not really free because they want you to purchase the apps after you exceeded your search or else, you have to wait I don't know how long before you can search flights again."
3332,Bloodyal420,"November 7, 2010",5,Amazin This is a amazing app! It does everything as advertised. Searches take minutes to find anything. Recommend to all

I'm using an iPhone 3G with latest OS. This has a major bug."
3342,MCynowicz,"January 20, 2017",5,Kayak is great I use it all the time to look up available flights and always find great prices
3343,Epic Fury,"February 13, 2017",3,"Easy to use It's great for saving money. It just needs to have hot tub as an amenity option. It only has pool or spa, neither of which guarantee a hot tub. I have to read the comments or scroll the pictures or google the hotel's actual website."

3364,KristaRenea,"March 7, 2016",3,Good but... I've always like kayak but it would be helpful if you would allow price alerts to be set for multi city travel! I rarely stay in one place when I travel and can't see the best deals with no price alert.

3388,Eye Man 2 C,"July 16, 2015",1,"Ruined by ""Clean Design"" App used to make sense and I used it regularly. In a sprucing up effort (unnecessary), they've destroyed the functionality. The new filters are useless. All I want is to filter by price, stars, pets accepted, whatever, not this arbitrary ""luxury"", ""family"", ""boutique"", etc. garbage. Do the people designing/approving these changes actually travel?"

When I clicked ""Book Now"" it took me to the Delta airlines site and said that Delta would show the currency in HK dollars.

When I complained to Kayak they wrote that I should have read fine print! Apparently all bookings on this site are non-refundable unless otherwise noted. Horrendous scam! Buyer beware.

3958,Streetraker,"October 18, 2013",1,"Travel Videos Troubling I find it dismaying that your travel correspondent is not traveling to, or offering video information about, any travel destinations where people of color live. What a terribly missed opportunity to neglect the rich cultures, cuisines and natural beauty of the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean, South America, etc. Very interesting.

5016,Kw 0816,"November 4, 2013",1,"0 stars Oh my, if you decide to use Kayak then pray you don't have to calm customer service.  The upside of their customer service is that their English is so bad they don't understand the words one says to express their frustration and the downside is that their English is so bad they can't understand anything you say."
5017,Mt. Noonan,"December 9, 2013",2,Missing Gate Information I love this app for business travel but with the new upgrade they've hidden the gate information. Kind of important when your running to make a connection. I'm switching to another app. Too bad.

5028,Micheal Brockel,"May 26, 2013",1,Unsatisfied This app does nothing to help me. I can call the airport and have them give me better ticket prices then I can find them on here. I don't see any reason for anyone to use this app if they say they can get the best deals out there and they never have the best deal. I will never use this app again.
5029,KayKultan,"May 26, 2013",1,"Useless Search of flights takes forever, results are cryptic, layover airports labeled only w cryptic 3 letter abbreviations. Even after looking at the flight details still have no idea which city my layover is in. How about listing the city next to each airport designation? Eg LAX, Los Angeles. Or BUR, Burbank CA.) other similar issues. Could've been done better."
