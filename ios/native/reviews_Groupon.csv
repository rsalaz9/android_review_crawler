0,Matt_knick,"July 18, 2019",5,"Groupon Experience üëçüëç Every time I have ordered a Groupon offer, the experience has always been very pleasant & over the years I have had a couple issues, but they were always addressed quickly & resolved quickly. "
1,GramJo55,"July 16, 2019",5,"GranJo55 I've been ordering from Groupon for about 4-41/2yrs. So far I've been perfectly happy with everything l have ordered, both the service and the quality of the items and or services. Admittedly I've always been very paranoid about being scammed online and very slow to start trusting online companies so I tend to read every single word of every description! It drives my husband crazy because I'll read, reread then mull it over for hours sometimes days before I finally decide to make my purchases. And if it comes to a place I've never heard of I always check for reviews outside of Groupon before dealing with them. But it seems to have paid off because I'm happy with everything I've gotten so far. I've gotten gifts for my kids and grandkids, household items, clothing and my husband and I used 3 different offers for hotels and services to book a dream road trip through the central Texas hill country during summer of 2017! (So glad we got to go when we did, to see this beautiful part of Texas before Harvey messed up so much down there!) Our stay at El Tropicana in San Antonio on the river walk, a great package for a full day and food package at Sea World San Antonio, and a stay at the Omni West in Houston were all phenomenal experiences that we wouldn't have had without Groupon, but will definitely strive to repeat!"
2,Gmb1987,"March 21, 2020",4,"Been using Groupon for years I have been a Groupon customer for years, mostly get local massage and food deals. I appreciate this service but do wish the business owners got to keep more of the proceeds. They are basically posting deals to get new customers and some have said it doesn‚Äôt often lead to long term repeat customers. In my case, I‚Äôm usually getting a Groupon for restaurants that I go to already but want to have some savings. Groupon is great for the consumer but it may not be the best investment for local businesses. I would be curious to know what the ROI and conversion rate metrics are for local business owners who offer sales on Groupon. Admittedly I have purchased a lot of massages but haven‚Äôt really stayed with one massage therapist. That lends to my mentality as a consumer, why would I pay 60 the second time when I could pay someone else to do something very similar for 30? Or even 25 on a sale day! This service is for deal hunters like me but by appearances does not seem to be extremely helpful to certain types of business owners. Which is why I tip well, at least to help them out. If I‚Äôm wrong about the benefit to business owners, I would love to know! Feeling a little gross about the reality of my shopping habits now that I‚Äôve written this review so hopefully I‚Äôm mistaken and this platform is helpful in the long term for small business owners."
3,TinaSMP56,"May 1, 2020",4,"Purchase on Groupon My purchases have mostly been good. I had one incident a few years ago. I paid for 3 sessions of house cleaning, paid about $115.  It took several weeks to get in contact with the seller then it was several weeks before she could book me an appointment. I wanted to book all three appointments & she wouldn‚Äôt. She said I could book the next appointment when she came the first time. No one showed up for my first cleaning. After several attempts she finally answered my call & said the lady she had scheduled had car trouble or something. I said a phone call to me would have been appreciated. I took off work to be home. Rescheduled appointment, about 2 weeks out this time. Again no one showed & I had someone there to meet up. Again several attempts to contact when she did answer the lady‚Äôs child was sick üôÑ. Seriously?! Again a phone would have been appreciated. She wouldn‚Äôt book another appointment, said she‚Äôd get back to me. She never did. A few months later, we were preparing to move out of Tulsa area so I thought great I‚Äôll get ‚Äúher‚Äù to come clean while I‚Äôm packing . Called multiple times & left messages. Never got a call back. Then her number was no longer working. üò© So I threw that $115 to the wind! Contacted Groupon & it had been over a year at this point so they ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt‚Äù refund my money ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4,othertwin,"October 22, 2019",3,"Just purchased curtains Although, I haven‚Äôt even seen them yet, I‚Äôm still worried about the quality , but I specifically chose it for a certain room but now, if that is going to stop light from coming in completely, I just may choose a different room for these. I always look for more different stuff and sometimes even hope for the best deal of the day on something I would really want , I hope other genders come into your site to sell their products because it would be nice to see changes of different things, not just changing between the 4 seasons. I recently purchased the angry supplements and I‚Äôm afraid to say , they give me heartburn so badly, and I‚Äôm belching the tumeric and ginger.  Although it may be amazing for someone else, they are not for me. I just don‚Äôt ever want to do business with companies that are NOT in the USA only because I have had a terrible experience with dealing with them and what they show you is definitely NOT what your getting, cheap scratchy material ect anyway I‚Äôm so looking forward to these new curtains in my home ! I‚Äôm very excited and can not wait thank you Groupon !!! Once in a while it also would be nice to send a 5 dollar off coupon to all your email member that bought for appreciation day just bought from a local retailer, and I‚Äôm happy to see that here and of course,,,,, my new year pair of slippers!!!!!!! For sure ! Muk luk can‚Äôt beat it !!!!"
5,MSFMD,"July 19, 2018",5,"Review Me and my husband have used Groupon on and off for about 3 years but we recently started relying on Groupon for the last year after getting married ...... if we take a trip first place we check is Groupon...you offer ridiculously unbelievable prices. in our most recent trip we wanted to stay an extra day and asked what the charge would be. The same amount we payed for the 3 days is what one extra day would cost! need something that we can‚Äôt really find?.....GROUPON has it. The variation of the same thing is what I like as well...... I‚Äôm the type of woman who loves a certain item and needs it in absolutely every color. The only thing that I,as a customer, found  a little difficult is that when you do book a trip and you accidentally made an error you cannot go back and change it..... our fault but I believe that if you are able to catch it right then and there you should be able to fix it. None the less, THANK YOU Groupon you guys are the best!!! Thanks for making trips actually happen for me and my husband. Growing up sheltered, it‚Äôs nice to finally be able to do it not only because I‚Äôm married but because of your amazing deals! Being financially savvy is the way to enjoy vacations and get aways! I can‚Äôt thank you guys enough!"
6,Stephsteph79,"June 14, 2018",3,"Needs improvement Though I do enjoy Groupon and have spent thousands over the years with Groupon, they are in need of improvement. One issue I have is returning a Groupon. It is ridiculously inconvenient and beyond frustrating to try to return or exchange a Groupon. Instead of getting Groupon bucks, which seems to be a more logical and fair thing to do, Groupon only allows you to purchase another Groupon in only a certain area, i.e. ‚Äúa local deal‚Äù, etc. and within a short period of time. It is a complicated system and I lose more money through Groupon, and I am beginning to expect it was designed that way. People do not want to deal with such hassle so I assume most people would simply forget about it. Which I have done in the past because I don‚Äôt feel like dealing with only 24 hours to search for local deals. Not only that, but most local deals in my area are the same old thing that we always see advertised in a Groupon. Little variation. And I don‚Äôt want to redo those things again and No, I don‚Äôt want another massage! So it is very limiting. I have had much frustration over this one issue. Also, with all the times I have had to speak to Groupon, those who answer the line have accents so thick I can hardly understand them. And though a few of the staff have been friendly and professional, I have dealt with quite the opposite most of the time."
7,Groupon you lost me forever,"April 2, 2020",1,"I would rate 0 star if I could First of all I want to say, Groupon doesn‚Äôt really care about their customers. I‚Äôve never left a bad review but here you go Groupon you can have this one. "
8,Aaaaadddddddssssssss,"March 26, 2018",5,"Groupon has your back I've been using Groupon for years. I've always had great experiences with local businesses honoring their Groupon. Recently, I had a very bad problem with a seller. They didn't honor what their groupon's fine print stated, they were making threats, yelling at me and following me to my car, etc. Overall, the worst experience I've ever had with any type of service. Groupon wasn't available to contact immediately because it was a Sunday evening when services were provided, but they were available at 6:30 am the next morning. I shared my experience and they quickly issued a full refund and escalated the concern to someone higher up. Thank you for trusting your customers and being a responsible business. I will continue to use Groupon only because the way they handled this issue. "
9,Secretsquirrel218,"May 1, 2020",2,Sometimes good. Sometimes not. There have been a few times I‚Äôve had positive experiences where the company items were quality and the check out was easy. 
10,melizhur,"February 23, 2018",1,"Refunded Incorrectly I purchased a groupon for a keratin treatment at style@ben salon in midtown. When I called the salon to make the appointment, I first tried the phone number on the voucher that belonged to someone‚Äôs personal cell (this person was in no way affiliated with style@ben). So I turned to yelp to find the salon‚Äôs actual number and was told that they do not offer keratin treatments through Groupon. I informed him that I had already paid for the Groupon but he was clear and finite that Groupon had made a mistake and the salon only offers a haircut/blowout deal. I then turned back to Groupon to contact customer service but, of course, there‚Äôs no phone number to call so I settled for the online chat with a customer service rep. She was perfectly apologetic and prompt in her communications. She explained my options (after ignoring my request for a full refund) and I decided to trade in the Groupon for another salon‚Äôs keratin offer. The issue is that I paid $99 for the initial Groupon and only received $87 in ‚ÄúGroupon bucks.‚Äù I should not be held financially accountable for any of the oversights, miscommunications, or mistakes that were made by both the salon and Groupon. (Though the responsibility ultimately rests on Groupon.) I am extremely disappointed in the customer service I received while trying to resolve this matter. All of the roadblocks and the end result make this feel like a scam."
11,MJHDWH,"June 27, 2018",1,"Terrible! I am extremely disappointed with Groupons service. Their customer service is only available through email and even the managers refuse to co tact you via phone. They are incredibly rude and have no desire to help you. They take half the cost of your Groupon from the business and will never refund more then half your cost. They also only provide Groupon bucks back. My husband and I booked a beautiful hotel via their site and trusted that it was accurately represented- nope. Not at all. The pictures looked 5 stars. The reality was an awful hotel staff. A hallway without AC that smelled of mold. A hotel room with a loud, broken AC. We called the hotel staff 5 times within our first hour begging to have our room changed due to the broke , loud AC and they refused. I finally spoke to the manager that promised to refund our cost due to all the trouble and allowed us to leave the hotel to find a different place to stay. I was guaranteed Groupon would refund my full cost to my credit card and would easily see it in the system. Well, after 4 week of emailing Groupon, since they don‚Äôt provide a phone number and refuse to call you, they refuse to provide any customer service. They will not refund this awful experience. I will not be shopping with Groupon again. What a terrible company that has no care for what they advertise. Such lies and awful service."
12,Kathit2003,"July 6, 2018",5,"Great prices & sales but buying direct use CC or Paypal catch ! They have great sales on multiple items, to use cash/debit/not on your credit card use Paypal it‚Äôs  way easier at checkout ! "
13,jng72905,"January 10, 2019",1,"Groupon sells shady deals for sketchy ‚Äúbusinesses‚Äù I have used Groupon many times but I purchased two massage certificates for my husband and I for Christmas. I purchased mine in November went to the website too book it the same day. Calendar all booked up until January 2019. So I wait two months and get to the place on time to find out the door is locked. Saw people moving around inside so I knock. Lady comes out with a long piece of weave in her hands (she was braiding and cutting it). Anyhow she tells me that the person no longer works there and I was the 5th person she has turned away. She told me to contact Groupon for a refund. Won‚Äôt you know it they will not refund me. I know the fine print tells you after 3 days all sales final but I did not see it say they will sell me a Groupon for a shady place, make me wait passed the refund period, and then never get services and it‚Äôs just oh well. Now I have to waste time, energy, and money and find a lawyer. I am gathering information to send to the news outlets as well. People need to know Groupon is selling for shady businesses that have no intention of actually providing the service and no matter what you won‚Äôt be refunded. I have contacted the owner of the location multiple times, wouldnt you know it she is ignoring me. I have contacted Groupon via chat, email, and the call me back option, and yes you guesses it they are absolutely ignoring me! STAY AWAY FROM GROUPON AND FRESH BEAUTY STUDIO IN STOCKBRIGE, GA!!!!!"
14,Photographer2016,"March 6, 2019",5,"Good stuff I didn't know I needed. I have never had a problem that was not satisfactorily resolved over the course of numerous Groupon orders. (Let's face it, sometimes ""stuff"" happens- often due to poor/mis-design of the Order fulfillment systems, not human error, or flat-out bad/fraudulent business practices). Items usually arrive within 5 to 7 working days and are generally or exactly- in the case of definable beyond words and a picture items like a refurbished robot vacuum- as described. good source of attractively priced items that are often something that I have been thinking of buying, but haven't liked pricing or shipping costs that I have found until seeing a Groupon offering. Some (most) tech items will be prior versions- like a ""Ring"" brand doorbell (why do you think the price is so low?), so know this going in. If it is computer related and you run Apple, check and be sure it will work with your system. I am still trying to resolve installation problems with a Wi-Fi extender that came with inadequate installation software."
15,MisterTouch,"April 16, 2020",1,Customer Service is NO HELP I am in need of Groupon customer service due to an order (mask) from Groupons that has yet to be delivered ! It has been almost 2 weeks since the order was placed AND that order was marked as ‚Äúshipped‚Äù and ‚Äúin transit‚Äù at the time of this writing. That status has been the same status for 11 days now and the item is coming from California! 
16,Ginger me up,"August 12, 2019",1,Fingerless gloves I have carpal tunnel and ordered 2 different types of fingerless gloves. I was charged for 2 types of fingerless gloves that were Totally Different than those I ordered and the pics originally that came up when I went to purchase them. What do they send - substitutes?  I don‚Äôt want substitutes. The first pair I got was made so cheaply you could probably buy in the $1 store. Awful. I threw them in my garbage. The second pair was supposed to be furry fingerless also. They were furry but with an open flap that all your fingers come out at once - a mitten style. This was not anywhere in the description. I can‚Äôt use these. 
17,ex-waze user,"October 29, 2019",1,"Loved it, now I hate it I have used Groupon for years without an issue. My sister gifted me a massage, which I tried to book for MONTHS and finally it expired. ‚ÄòPromotional value expires, amount paid never expires‚Äô so I tried to use the amount paid ($150) but the vendor said they will not honor the amount paid. So I contacted Groupon and they won‚Äôt even speak to me cause it was a gift and I didn‚Äôt purchase it. They ended up refunding my sister (she was annoyed because she didn‚Äôt want to deal with it again) but she worked with me. We picked another place and she got me the Groupon, I contact the vendor for a hair salon and she said Groupon doesn‚Äôt pay her and she will not take the Groupon because she working for free. This vendor should be REMOVED from the Groupon option so no one else is fraudulently purchasing groupons and then stuck with ‚ÄòGroupon Bucks‚Äô. And now they are giving my sister the money back again but as bucks that can be spent within 24 hours.  customer service said contact the vendor BEFORE purchasing to make sure they Accept the Groupon. IF THEY DONT ACCEPT THE GROUPON THEY SHOULD NOT BE FOR SALE ON GROUPON!!! Also if someone gifts you a gift, than stop bothering the purchaser of said gift and deal with the person who was given the gift. "
18,fscarp,"September 9, 2019",2,"Good idea, not well operated Although I love the idea of saving moneys and can‚Äôt pass up a good deal, I don‚Äôt know if I will continue using Groupon due to their serious lack of adequate customer service. It is RIDICULOUS how hard it is to get in contact with anyone at this company. I would rather sit on hold for 45 min than wait around all day for a representative to call me back. Their live chat never seems to be an option, and I haven‚Äôt tried the email option because my issue is slightly more complicated than a simple one email response, so I don‚Äôt want to spend all week emailing back and forth. I have never seen another company operate with this type of customer support and with a company this large you think it would be as simple as providing a customer service phone number to contact. Seriously frustrating and disappointed with the lack of service!!! I‚Äôd rather pay full price than have issues using my Groupons and spend hours of my time trying to get help resolving them. "

When we arrived we noticed the sheets and towels were not clean and not even an hour into stay, while we were getting settled in a ROACH comes crawling across the wall alongside my bed. I was almost willing to over look the sheets and towels but having BUGS is not acceptable! We gathered our things and went to ask for our refund so we could find a place elsewhere but the receptionist at the desk tells us we have to go through Groupon for our return. It‚Äôs has been a week and we have not gotten anything but the run around saying the situation has been ‚Äúescalated‚Äù meanwhile me and my husband are left stranded trying to find someone to take us in on what money we had left.

21,Blake32p,"October 15, 2018",1,"App did not work at the time of redemption Went out to dinner to local restaurant but before I left I purchased a Groupon. My husband and I ordered all her food, ate dinner & when the bill came I tried to open the app and it would not open on my phone it kept giving me an error message. Restaurant said they couldn‚Äôt do anything without the Groupon. So I ended up spending the money on the Groupon as well as all the money for the food at a restaurant I wouldn‚Äôt normally eat at. "
22,wow not impressed,"December 28, 2018",2,"Not as slick as they claim to be. Groupon is supposed to be super simple but my mom purchased these tickets for us for Christmas and it was nothing but a pain. She put that she wanted to order 2 and clicked purchase for some reason it ended up sending her a confirmation email stating she had bought 6!!! These aren‚Äôt cheap and going from 2 to paying for 6 is a chunk of money. She searched and searched for the contact information and finally got in touch with someone over the phone. She told them to cancel 4 of them, they ended up canceling 5 instead. Then she tried to buy one more so that we wouldn‚Äôt just have 1 ticket and they said that she had exceeded her limit on tickets she could buy so it wouldn‚Äôt allow her to purchase another ticket. So now I have to go on and buy another ticket and make sure that everything works out so that we can sit together. Christmas presents are supposed to be easy. I stopped using Groupon all together about 2 years ago because it‚Äôs not as easy as they make it out to be. And a lot of the time the fine print isn‚Äôt as legit as you think! Watch out they‚Äôll get ya!! Oh and on a side note even choosing a nickname to POST a review is complicated!! You have to pick a nickname that hasn‚Äôt been taken!!! This is a joke!!!"
23,Nizo_Aruba,"February 13, 2019",3,"Great application! I‚Äôve been using GroupOn for about 3/4 years if I‚Äôm not mistaken and I hope I don‚Äôt jinx myself by saying this, but I have never had an issue! Great application and great prices! "
24,BDK727,"February 13, 2019",1,"Robbery I used to use groupon all the time. It‚Äôs been a while and yesterday I purchased a couples massage from the us in usd for Canada. I thought that was amazing! Then my girlfriend stated ‚Äúbe careful, they double charge me all the time.‚Äù I figured it had either been fixed by now or since I never had it happen, most likely it wouldn‚Äôt. Today I fly out to Canada and as I‚Äôm tying up some loose ends, I see an alert that Groupon took a 2nd dip into my account. Totally uninitiated and definitely without my consent. This took everything down to my last dollar out of my account and I‚Äôve spent the last hour scrambling to get money reloaded on my card for my Uber to the airport so I don‚Äôt miss my flight. While I did request a refund, I‚Äôm hoping it wasn‚Äôt for the voucher I‚Äôd already booked an appointment for and getting ahold of customer service is literally impossible. No human to get on the phone. They advertise live chat (which was pulling teeth to find access to) just to be told no agents available and there was no que. I had to send an email. No telling when I‚Äôll hear back or get my money back that I NEED for my trip. What a rip off. I‚Äôm sure plenty people are getting scammed if they don‚Äôt check their statements. My review will remain one star until this scam is corrected. I say scam because it‚Äôs clearly a known issue and it‚Äôs not fixed."
25,Lexi911!!!,"April 23, 2019",5,Bar Tending Groupon Course I had two difficulties that I needed to be helped with so my rating is going to go to my chat with Amanda I don‚Äôt remember her middle initial or initial of her last name. The first thing that I needed to do and didn‚Äôt know how to do was to cancel my purchase I had only put it in my cart at the time and I was told to just go to the card and delete it. So I did that. My second problem was that I purchased of course that gave you an option to purchase two courses. When I went to check out I could not figure out how to pick my courses I‚Äôm actually still waiting to hear back on the purchase. But I did actually turn around and hit the one course and paid for it and now I‚Äôm going back to try to pay for the second one. Amanda was very helpful on the deletion of one product and then I lost her and she became not there anymore so I‚Äôm gonna go back and call again or should I say chat again all right well I hope this was not too much and thank you I‚Äôm very pleased with coupon
26,Ash_Luxxx,"March 27, 2020",1,"No stars. I booked a hotel through Groupon back in February for a March concert. When corona hit I had to cancel because of course everything was canceled. So I called the hotel I booked, cancelled through there, no problem at all, but was told I also have to cancel through Groupon, so I went through Groupon chat because their phones were so busy due to the virus which no problem at all.

27,foxydee88,"October 19, 2019",5,"Super Team!! I began to use Groupon sometimes last year and at first viewed all the deals with a cloud of a doubt, relying on an old saying ‚Äú if it looks too good, then it is too good to be true‚Äù. However, I kept my eyes open for a while on a spa deals, women clothing( especially underwear üòú, I‚Äôm secretly a lingerie fanatic) and other miscellaneous items."
28,KingEazyness,"August 18, 2019",3,Disappointed I have been using Groupon for a couple years and purchased many Groupon deals with great results. I hate that I am writing this but a recent experience I‚Äôve had shined some negative light on Groupon. My father purchased some groupons for a local food establishment. When we showed up to use the deal we found out the business went out of business. Windows boarded up and place cleared out closed. When my father noticed Groupon they tried not refunding his money until he started using the word fraud then he was told he would be getting a refund. I notified Groupon the restaurant is no longer in operation and they need to take the Groupon off their site. A week later and they are still offering the Groupon deal. Groupon is knowingly taking people‚Äôs money even though they have been notified the company is no longer in operation. This is fraud selling goods where the party will never receive what they paid for. Everytime I tried contacting customer support I‚Äôm redirected to another country and and the instant chat is cut short when I complain. Very disappointed because I have really enjoyed using Groupon in the past.
29,debileecarlisle,"June 20, 2019",3,"Not a fan kids rating So my girls are 13, 12 and 10.  After two and half hours they were bored and asked to leave.  Didn‚Äôt find the lazy river or slides thrilling enough to spend another minute there.  "
30,EstherGar,"October 8, 2018",5,"Excellent service! I recently had an issue over purchasing a hotel getaway. I followed the instructions on ‚Äúfrequency asked questions‚Äù and started a live chat. I had explained that because of an issue during the purchasing process, my transaction had failed and in the off chance that if I cancel my card and resubmit my card on file, I didn‚Äôt want to get charged twice.  It had just happened to me recently. I got in contact with a representative through the online chat process. The representative had asked for my permission to cancel the failed transaction and gave me the green light to purchase again. I was still worried about being charged twice but the representative reassured me that that wouldn‚Äôt happen.  He\she really helped me out through that process. If you have any questions about what you‚Äôre buying or if an error occurred during the transaction I highly recommend chatting with a representative on Groupon live chat! They‚Äôre very fast and efficient!"
31,JonnyIhler,"February 24, 2019",5,Groupon Is Actually Quite Awesome I have purchased mostly retail items so far from the Groupon app since my shopping adventure has began. The products are just as listed; right down to how the retailer's sizes run (true-to-type/runs small/runs large) 
32,ladyRN,"March 20, 2019",1,"Worst company I tried to buy two different items in the same cart which is normal with any shopping online however with Groupon it does not allow you to buy multiple items you‚Äôre only allowed to purchase one in the cart so you have to pay double dipping in shipping that is not OK that is the most ridiculous greedy thing I have ever heard with any online company shopping I should not have to pay double triple quadruple whatever it is shipping because you make me purchase one item at a time and pay shipping for each item that is totally wrong I believe that‚Äôs a scam when you‚Äôre trying to double dip and make people pay over six dollars in shipping for each item purchased! I have never heard of a company not allowing you to put a cart full and check it out with multiple items Groupon makes you do it single late so they can screw you and charge you for every item with the shipping charge! I will not order from Groupon anymore I am banning them and I‚Äôm going to put it on my social media which I have over 10,000 followers to let other people know to ban Groupon because you‚Äôre screwing people and nickel and dime in people to pay shipping on every single item"
33,Jessie from 954,"April 14, 2019",5,All around Great service If you take Groupon for what it is you will see this it is indeed a great app. They do exactly what they have always promoted which is promoting both light and big businesses at discounted rates. People must ALWAYS remember that if they‚Äôve had a bad experience with a specific company this has absolutely nothing to do with Groupon but with witch ever individual company they‚Äôre promoting. Now that we are in a time were almost everything is done online I will tell everyone the same secret I tell my own mother. Before buying anything online ‚ÄúREAD REVIEWS‚Äù and once you buy something weather you enjoyed it or not write a review. If everyone did this small but important thing online shopping would be only ALWAYS an amazing experience but until that happens we are always going to have to play by ear and hope for the best! I hope this review Helps someone that‚Äôs on the fence about online shopping and using Groupon because I no me and my family love it..
34,Griff573,"April 25, 2019",1,"First impressions The product was fine, Groupon on the other hand, not so much. My first ever experience with Groupon I had ordered a drone. In checkout I was asked if I would like an extra battery for 10 dollars. I decided that was a good idea. At check out the screen told me the estimated time it would take to be delivered to me would be 2 days. 2 days later it said 7 days. 8 days later I received the drone with only 1 battery. The app and website were difficult to navigate which is probably how they like it, but also I‚Äôm oldish and perhaps am technologically stupid. I finally found Groupon live chat and the seemingly automated response texts took forever. The whole live chat thing probably lasted 20 minutes and somehow our connection together was conveniently disconnected directly after I had had enough and said to give me store credit instead of money back on my credit card which I told the ‚Äúperson‚Äù a couple of times but they conveniently did not respond to... I got back on the app and now have 5 dollars in store credit although the extra battery cost 10 if I remember correctly... unfortunately they have so many deals I‚Äôll continue to buy and this with fall on deaf ears."
35,mab9fab,"May 3, 2019",5,Trade-in on your voucher? I contacted Groupon customer support via chat which was very difficult to find on the Groupon app. I only saw the chat after I try to purchase a different Groupon and I saw the chat option on there. I searched and search for a customer support and a chat option but could not find it. It could‚Äôve been because it was after 5 PM Pacific standard time. I do not know for sure. However I was able to chat with a customer support person and his name was Alvin. I was able to trade in a Groupon voucher that expired today which was at a hair salon which I‚Äôve visited and was very discouraged at the looks of the place. It was not inviting at all and she had no customers in the salon at all. I would be afraid to go to that hair salon. Alvin was able to help me find a different Groupon that was more aesthetically pleasing.  I thought all Groupon‚Äôs were eligible for a trade-in but they are not but you do have three days to cancel a Groupon after purchase which I did not know.
36,stftny93,"December 28, 2019",1,Get names and titles I had a hotel stay booked and I had to cancel due to my daughter being admitted to the hospital. I called the hotel who advised me I needed to contact Groupon. I spoke to a representative at Groupon who assured me she would take care of it and I was in the 72 hour window and it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I was not granted a refund - Groupon said it was because the hotel would not grant it because I hadn‚Äôt cancelled in the allowable time. I spoke to the hotel and it was Groupon who had not notified the hotel for several days after I had spoken to their representative. I was very disappointed in this level or lack of customer service. I spoke to several people and it was as if they were reading a script to me. Super frustrating! I did try to escalate the matter but was told someone would call me the next day even though it was 3 pm. I never heard back. The hotel- Foxwoods representative recommended I file a complaint with hotel management regarding Groupon not handling this properly from the beginning. I am a mother of five I don‚Äôt have money to just throw out the window. Thanks to the person I spoke to at Groupon that is exactly what I did. I had a sick child and then this on top of it- very unacceptable way to treat a customer.

However, I had to refund a Groupon recently because the place was closed for a few months due to relocating. I tried literally everyday for a couple of weeks to reach Groupon without any success. When I was able to finally get hold of someone I couldn‚Äôt get a refund, I had to do a trade in. Now mind you, the place I purchased it for was going to be out of business for the time I got to Groupon until the expiration date. Ok, I ll do a trade in just because I‚Äôm so mad at this point. They had to do a credit of Groupon bucks and I had 24 hours to use it or it would default back to the original Groupon. Not only that but they didn‚Äôt give me back the full amount I original paid for the Groupons. ( I had bought two to the same place.) I‚Äôm done with Groupon.

Any time I tried to purchase it would say unavailable and eventually lead to a refund, or not completing because no confirmation was sent. I tried contacting customer service at least 15 times to no avail which was a nightmare especially since the activity I had to cancel and get refunded for they would only allow to be refunded through Groupon bucks. So here I am $120 Groupon ‚Äúbucks‚Äù but blocked by Groupon from making any purchases.

After spending over three hours taking to Groupon and SeaWorld customer service, I was basically told that there was nothing either company could do. So basically I had to eat the $287 that was spent for two-park access. I was even willing to get a partial refund for the one park that we did visit but Groupon was not having that! They seemed as if they did not know what to do to make me whole and showed no desire to even try to come up with a resolution. All I wanted was for my money to not be wasted and today it was!! So we are leaving Sunday morning and Groupon will not see to it that we get what I paid for!!! Such a lackadaisical attitude from customer service! They did not care.

I have never received one item that was broken, or in anything less than excellent new condition! I will continue using Groupon, as many items I need/want, I can find here much cheaper sometimes than the few other sites I frequent. One of my favorite features of this service, is that if I feel an item I really really want is a bit above my price range, I simply added it to my favorites. Most of the time, I will receive a notice letting me know the price has been reduced, at which point I am able to purchase the product at a reasonable cost 99% of the time (unless they ran out of stock).

I purchased one service for a $99 gutter cleaning, and the merchant told me ""oh, that's for $99 off a $400 purchase or more, but we couldn't explain it in the ad. It also doesn't cover gutter cleaning, only repairs"". Email and phone call later, and I got ""Groupon Bucks"", which I applied for a house cleaning. Scheduled the cleaning with the merchant, scheduled myself to be home on a Thursday, and called that morning to confirm the time to find that I had been canceled for a ""regular client, who needed last-minute service and will always come first over Groupon because I make more"" (merchant's words).

Starting that evening I've sent Groupon several emails in an effort to let them know the situation and find out how they are going to make things right. However  Groupon has not answered any of the emails I've sent to them.

I received no email or notification whatsoever telling me that this was canceled. Not only did I no longer have the deal and was unable to go to the appointment, but I was charged 30% of the original price by the spa for canceling within 24 hours before. I attempted to get in contact with Groupon to see if I could get some sort of compensation, but they are basically impossible to contact.

I have been able to treat my daughter to spa days and other offers in order to help her rejuvenate. Personally, I have found a new hairdresser, taken advantage of spa days myself and purchase many household items at a small percentage of the original price.

You can't beat the deals, quality or security. Return policy is top notch, customer service is responsive. My ONLY issue is when you are unable to use a group on (illness, technical issues), forget (it happens!!) or don't see it on your phone screen and it expires you are stuck with 'credits' that go unused. I've got about $200 in unused credits because the original pricing is so outrageous (that's what makes the group on deals SOOO amazing in the 1st place!) that those $5 or $20 credits don't make a difference. Some companies are GREAT about helping you out and others not so much. Yeah, adulting, know the deal, etc. Life happens!

Lately it has become a nightmare to contact them. Makes it even worse when the businesses offering the so called never expire amounts paid not returning your calls either. When you do finally reach out to Groupon you still find yourself reciting the info listed on the voucher and not honoring what is written on the voucher terms. Is it just me or are we better off without this middle person not following their own rules and not providing negative customer service experiences. Why take advantage of a person trying out new places. Turns out the never expires is an utter lie and will only credit 50%. Looks like Groupon is pocketing our purchase disappointments. Providing a value is what makes a company successful. Bummer you are falling short of this. Goodbye disappointments.

They have created a wonderful business but backed their firm up with non English speaking customer service representatives from the Philippines. They not only can't speak or understand English but their entire manner of conducting an appropriate level of serving the Groupon customer is not acceptable. They have a mindset where we customers, have an unlimited amount of time to invest in a issue that should be able to have a resolution in seconds. I will no longer purchase Groupon offers that might require me to need any contact with Groupon customer service. I urge all Groupon customers to do the same until they bring those jobs back home. Groupon has now ruined the value of purchasing their discounts for use at restaurants.

For the last three weeks I‚Äôve been trying to get a hold of customer service and every time it says we are doing updates on our system or coffee has spilled onto our system and we are cleaning it up. For three weeks.  How unacceptable it is that.   That is the message I‚Äôve been getting three weeks in a row. I thought the company went out of business I went online to see if they were still open. I would suggest only buy things that you are 100% sure you will never have a question about.  I hope Groupon cleans up his act and improves it‚Äôs customer service. Without customer service the company is useless. Good luck Groupon
72,Katherine.111,"September 26, 2018",1,"Horrible customer support experience After being a long time Groupon shopper, I will not be using Groupon anymore. I am very disappointed with how I was treated by Groupon customer service. It took weeks to get an answer and still no refund of $400+ they stole from me. Groupon customer service said that they called the vendor and they were not answering the phone. I called the vendor myself daily to see if Groupon had been in touch with them and they picked up the phone every time! The vendor said that I could not initiate the refund, Groupon had to contact them for the refund process. The vendor also informed me that Groupon had not called them yet. I even provided Groupon customer service with updated contact names and phone numbers just in case they were using the wrong phone numbers. I went above and beyond helping Groupon customer support and being patient. I am saddened and disappointed by their lies and poor business practices. Do not use Groupon, because if you need customer support, they will lie, not help you and steel your money."
73,Dan-Blu,"January 1, 2019",1,Satisfied with some purchases but had some iffy deals Most of my Groupon purchases have been excellent but I have paid for a facial/spa treatment in mid-2018 which was claimed or used while I was actually on a plane to England (phone turned off on the plane). I commented to the spa company but the they advised me that they do not have a handle of the claim and that it may have been Groupon. I do not know how to contact Groupon on this issue for a refund.

I tried numerous times to find a number so I could call and talk to a person, I received the shoes still after cancelling, I get the invoice and it says no shipping, I look on my credit card bill and I was charged more than the invoice in my package, I don‚Äôt like the shoes, it also said if I use fedex they would charge me $7.50, and then I would have to also pay to ship them.  I want my money back!!!!! , and there was a number on the invoice that I called, and it was a recording, if you go online there is no option to speak to a real person.  I don‚Äôt intend on ever shopping with Groupon ever again, they will probably not show my remarks.  BE AWARE SHOPPING WITH GROUPON!!!!!!!"

To me that means what ever choice I make it‚Äôs gonna be 1999 because that‚Äôs how it was worded. Fortunately I realized before I bought the earrings that they were 2499 supposedly because of the style I selected. When I was in Retail Sales That was known as a bait and switch. The store would advertise a product for a low price and then when the customer got there to buy it they were told they were out of stock and the salesman would try to sell a higher priced item to the unsuspecting customer. That‚Äôs deceitful. Before I‚Äôm allowed to post this I have to give you a nickname which I have tried to do many times but you keep saying the name has been taken.

I use Groupon for many different purchases and for browsing businesses and products I would otherwise never know about. I shop Groupon locally, occasionally, or throughout traveling. Groupon is usually very clear about the deals on the website and if there are any misunderstandings with merchants or products Groupon has resolved it or came to a good mediation. I look forward to continue using Groupon and I occasionally mention and recommend Groupon to my friends, family, and other people as well. I specially love receiving extra discount codes in my email from time to time. This makes shopping on Groupon even better, it‚Äôs exciting to see what kind of great deal I might come across with my additional discount codes. Thank You Groupon!"

Whether you‚Äôre searching for that perfect gift for the person who has everything or looking for a local adventure for your family, Groupon has it. Not only is it convenient, you save money, and that‚Äôs a win-win. I love how Groupon protects its buyers by allowing them to redeem local Groupons that have expired for the face value. Look at it this way, yes-bummer you let it expire,  but you‚Äôre not ‚Äúout‚Äù anything because Groupon let‚Äôs you spend what you paid. What other on-line selling APP does that!?!

Well I purchased a couples massage and my husband I both had the worst massage ever and the place was dirty and the sheets and towels smelled musty. I left the massage more stressed out and tense than when I got there. So I contacted customer support via live chat and was told she would be contacting me within 24 hours via email to follow up, I then proceeded to get the same generic email requesting my contact number and order number several times over the next 3 days and I responded to it 3 times before getting a response from a completely different customer service member telling me they‚Äôll do absolutely nothing about it so their groupon promise is a load of crap.

Thankfully, the lady at checkout called a manager over and the fixed the problem and advised that they will get with Groupon or figure it out later. Groupon did not get back with me about the matter until four days after I emailed them. The company fixed my issue but it wasn‚Äôt there issue. They could have easily denied it because it read expired. The email Groupon sent 24 hours later said that someone will be in contact with me soon. Then four days later a rep from Groupon emailed me and said since you redeemed the Groupon they couldn‚Äôt help. Well.... I didn‚Äôt need your help anymore. I could have had to pay double!

You will never get a redound just Groupon bucks that will put money back into their fraudulent company! Before spending your hard earned money to possibly be ripped off and scammed I advise you to read all reviews! The customer service is horrible!!!! They expect you to communicate through email which will take too long so they can say you can‚Äôt get a refund and to go back and read the fine print! Even if you have documentation that you cancelled before the deadline you still will not receive one. The online chat is useless as well. I hope no one has to go through the frustration that me and my family went through using this fraudulent app... Please be careful and check your statements because they have the tendency to charge multiple times for the same products and groupons ... This is a warning for people out there.. It‚Äôs almost better to just pay full price because you will spend more dealing with them.

Sure some people say wow that‚Äôs a lot to ship, but look at your postal rates that‚Äôs about what they are. I have used Groupon for food, items, and to go places. From both sides of the coast. It really works for trying new places and when your in different states. We used the Las  Vegas tower tour coupon that saved a lot, fine print it can not be used the day you buy it.

Give us back your phone number we have to do all the ordering via the internet so when there is a problem or just a question about something I want to order...too bad for the consumer.

88,SkyeBlueSam,"June 27, 2019",5,"Amazing customer service I was always hesitant to try out Groupon, but now I love it. Their refund policy is really strict, but they always stick to it. However, you can always trade in your voucher for a different one. Just make sure to find one before you trade it in because you only have 24 hours to find a new one if you trade it in first. Also, I put in a request for a callback from customer service and the guy was nice and professional. He got my voucher traded in within minutes. They also called me a bit earlier than the wait time listed. Overall I have had a couple of places that weren‚Äôt great, but that was my own fault for not looking at the reviews. Always look at the reviews. Since then I have always had great service. I recommend this service to everyone."

At times if I saw I have a Groupon it‚Äôs as if I said I have an expired gift card from 7 years ago I want honored. When at first vendors greet you as an awesome customer, tell them you have a Groupon and all of a sudden you go from ‚Äúhigh roller‚Äù to ‚Äú3rd class titanic passenger.‚Äù Not all vendors do this but in my experience the shift is noticeable.

I had to argue once about a cinema deal and was told to go to the other cinema which was 50 miles away! They refused to give my money back! Getaway deals also are challenging. I was gifted a deal and had a very hard time getting it honored. The place kept telling me that room was sold out and they forced me to upgrade at a big extra cost to me. Groupon didn‚Äôt care! Said it was an issue with the hotel. Unless you are buying goods which at times are cheap in quality. Buyer beware. So, I get local deals to places I know otherwise I don‚Äôt bother.

Last year someone hacked my account and changed the email address and obviously password. It took me 2 weeks to rectify the problem and lost out on a couple of deals. Each time I ended up online chatting with someone new and had to tell the entire problem from the beginning all over again. There‚Äôs no way to call someone to speak to. It‚Äôs  an infuriating way to conduct business. None of the people I ‚Äúchatted‚Äù with were based in the US. You could tell by the words and sentence structure that English was their second language. This just added another layer of frustration and confusion.

They avoid speaking so only have me an option for email or chat. I asked for my room to be either switch or refunded because they gave me an ‚Äúocean view‚Äù that has a parking lot view. When I called the front office they stated only Groupon could make a change since I paid them directly which makes sense. When I told Groupon that they kept referring me to the hotel and would not take ownership. I was advised I could leave the hotel and request a refund later. So then how could they say that but not be able to give me a refund upon request. Obviously this means they are just trying to get me to shut up or they are lying about being able to refund me. I then asked if I could be connected to a supervisor/manger and was told they would email me. Or course I have no idea when that will be and does not solve my issue. I will never book with Groupon again! Such horrible service!

Sometimes that happens with processing systems.... I get it. I purchase online a lot and sometimes there are glitches. So I started the purchase over and it went through. Come to find out an hour later that I was DOUBLE CHARGED! I contacted customer service to rectify the issue and they told me all sales were final for this particular deal and there was nothing they would do.

Best change Groupon Made recently was allowing a trade in for expired or about to be expired vouchers, as well as extensions for expiration dates.  I would like for the customer service to be less complicated, it feels like a hassle to get someone on the phone or on a live chat for trade ins.

For example, when you purchase a Groupon and the vendor charges you for a FLOWER VASE as is an extra charge AND for deliveries and WON‚ÄôT use the credit that you have left over from your purchase, etc. This portion of Groupon‚Äòs and these flower vendors is a scam! You should not buy flowers through Groupon‚Äòs especially through all these new Groupon flower sites - it‚Äôs a scam! You think you‚Äôre paying $30 for $55 for something and it‚Äôs going to take care everything? - NO! There will be mandatory fees and whatever credit you have left over will not be used towards the ‚Äúflower‚Äù.  Don‚Äôt buy flowers from these vendors on Groupon. It‚Äôs a scam!"

I was receiving a 20% discount the night before my booking when i was looking for deals and then the next day they said sorry but its not working. The coupon was applied before and it worked and now they didn‚Äôt give me the discount. After going back and forth with the customer rep, i was really frustrated because i was saving $187 according to the rep at first. I was ready to receive it as credit to my account as the rep had informed me. The rep put me on hold and cane back after two minutes saying he is unable to give it to me now after speaking to his consultant.

The fine print of my purchase did not say anywhere that adults under 21 could not check into the hotel. When I got to the hotel, they would not let me check in because I am 20, despite Groupon accepting a payment from my personal credit card. I sat in my car during around midnight trying to get a hold of Groupon or enterprise to see if I could get my stay transferred or purchase refunded, but lines were ‚Äúbusier than normal at this time‚Äù as it had said the duration of the day, which was why I could not get in contact with Groupon about changing my email address.

Of course you can not get a hold of a person to help so I tried to delete additional order thru the app but then only 1 of the 4 I tried to get refunded showed up as returned online. After going to website and app I finally saw (an hour later) that all 4 had been returned.

I didn‚Äôt have the app and was forced to download (despite limited space on my phone-and delete other things) to be able to communicate with someone. I never figured out how to get a call back and found myself going in circles just to be able to do a live chat. When you are experiencing issues the last thing you need is to deal with a company that seems to not really want to be bothered with people. I‚Äôm not sure if that was the reason for ending a direct phone line between customers and service personnel, but it sure feels that way. I was rather reluctant to make another purchase for fear that if something went wrong I would endure the hassle of trying to get help in a less than helpful way."

How about that it be even  voiceover accessible? Well,  it actually really is. That along with everything else truly makes it a hard app to top.

They are not refundable nor can you use dollars spent on something else.....Unless they offer a special trade in day once the Groupon expires or is about to expire. I purchased permanent makeup and microblading recently but my experience was so bad for the eyeliner application I couldn‚Äôt let the same tech do my eyebrows so I called Groupon and asked for a refund or to use it somewhere else...infatically no! I was done with Groupon at that point. Then when it was about to or had expired they gave me the option to reuse the money elsewhere. Why didn‚Äôt they tell me that this option would be available? So my one complaint is actually poor communication and lack of telling you the fine print!!

128,Shanexxl,"August 10, 2019",1,No thanks. So much lost money due to find print. Groupon really doesn‚Äôt save you money over the price of the business. 9/10 it‚Äôs cheaper in person. Then on top of this when you do find a good deal Groupon has fine print longer than most fancy hotels. All my deals expire long before I can use them. The process to trade them in or lose your deal is time consuming and complicated. No refunds. I have 100‚Äôs stuck in Groupon that I can‚Äôt use. Maybe if you live in the city this site will work for you but I live in the country. Everything is spread way out. The closest things to me are hours away and then match that with expiration dates and required appointments for the deal and then those places don‚Äôt have openings so you lose everything. I am done with this app and site. 0 stars if I could. I‚Äôd sooner just go on a trip and explore and find deals myself that I can use at that moment then try to trust Groupon has my back. Because they don‚Äôt.

Only sent back a couple things due to size.  Read reviews. It helps a lot when buying.    Only negative is when you need help.  Terrible actually. Also, the credit card charging system is confusing!!  Charges or reserves the full amount to your card then breaks it up individually and charges again, then removes the initial holding charge.  Don‚Äôt mind the hold but when you try to make sure the charges are accurate, it‚Äôs almost impossible unless you print or save your purchase information.  Since most probably do this on their mobile, that probably won‚Äôt happen. Fix this and I will be much happier. :)"

When I tried to make an appointment with the salon they told me they had moved and Groupon had not changed the old address on their site. Their new location was significantly farther from my home. Therefore I had to cancel. The second was for a massage in a chiropractor's office. When I called to make that appointment, they indicated that they did not have a masseuse on staff right now and were interviewing for one so they weren't sure how soon the massage would be available. I had to trade that too.  I have also noticed that many of the prices they're discounting from are really made up. If you go to the vendors website and see what that item costs directly from the, it is significantly lower than what they are saying you're getting a discount from. I find that pretty dishonest.  I hope they improve their accuracy before I use them again."

Per the confirmation email I received when I purchased the Groupon I was allowed to cancel the Groupon until a certain date and time. I contacted Groupon to let them know I could not stay at this hotel and the front desk at the hotel told me when I informed them I would not be staying there due to condition of hotel to reach out to Groupon for refund. However Groupon gave me the run around for nearly a month and ultimately stated that they cannot issue a refund without hotel approval and that they will not honor the written refund policy. This is a horrible way to do business.

Like for instance I have a BOB vacuum I found the exact one I have on here but Groupon says its original price is almost $800 and they were selling it for like $300 something, when the original price is really only $215 so your actually getting really ripped off.

I‚Äôd like to locate Chef Kamal Chanaka because considering the decline in quality,  it‚Äôs clear he is no longer there and I think he is worth following! My last effort to use my Smith Commons Groupons was Saturday evening.  I ordered the mussels and the sauce was pure butter without seasoning and it was served with a sweet biscuit. I also ordered the ravioli and it had the same butter sauce without seasoning.  Groupon has made it easy for me to trade in my remaining vouchers and I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring new restaurants.  Thank you Groupon!!"

It‚Äôs stuff you are going to do anyways and you save a ton of money! Some of the goods items are good deals too but they get you with the shipping and handling. If you want to buy more than one than you have to do it individually and you pay the full shipping on EACH of them! Like this week they had a deal ending in 9.12 where a 9.99 item was 6.99 and I wanted 3 of them but they wanted me to buy one at time which was almost $20 in shipping so I didn‚Äôt buy them. I was so bummed because my cousins children have a birthday party coming up and they would have LOVED them. So you have to be careful and look at it ALL when buying goods.

After buying one Groupon using the extra discount I saved $45...definitely worth the $5/month. If you buy two groupons in a year with the extra discount, the select membership is worth it.

As a consumer who works hard for her money, And spends a hell of a lot of money on Groupon‚Ä¶ I see no valid reason why they could not have helped me. Regardless of how old the Groupon is, if the exact same deal is currently available, there is no logical reason why we can‚Äôt reactivate those Groupon‚Äòs... that‚Äôs just ridiculous.

However today is Tuesday and it‚Äôs still sitting in Sacramento whether it be the post office or the Fed ex I thought FedEx meant federal express. They tell me it would be delivered on Thursday the 27th. This sounds a little ridiculous to me and when speaking with Fed ex they tell me it‚Äôs because of the choice you made on the shipping arrangements. If you can make it across the entire United States in three days why can‚Äôt it be delivered in Sacramento from Sacramento in less than a week?

It did not show up in my available apps and I did not receive an email confirming that the purchase was made. The app was also acting funny so I did not think the purchase went through. I looked in my available Groupons and it was not there. I even received an email from Groupon asking me if I was still interested in the deal. This deal was final sale which I totally understand. But there was clearly an issue. I reached out to Groupon and even though it is their issue they said there is nothing they can do about it. This is extremely poor customer service and should have been taken care of. I would be very mindful of using this app. Know that they will not work with you even if it‚Äôs an issue with their app.

I moved to a crazy town in Colorado that doesn‚Äôt deliver mail to the homes in the original downtown area. The USPS FORCES US to use P.O.

They also don‚Äôt allow refunds when you put trust in their company to send your items by anything other than USPS. Did they do ANYTHING to make it right for a long time customer? Never!

Their refund policy is also horrible so make sure you are more than 100% positive you want your Groupon. If you buy your Groupon and use it after the 3rd day and had a horrible experience provided by the Groupon and the redeemer/redeemee agree to the refund, Groupon won‚Äôt actually grant that to you.

As far as health services or beauty services there‚Äôs no way in hell you could get me to trust anyone who uses Groupon for advertising. They are essentially willing to work for 25% of their usual rate just to get customers in the door. Do you think that‚Äôs a good business policy? No. And it also has the ability to absolutely KILL many industries. People who use Groupon never return don‚Äôt become good clients and as far as I‚Äôm concerned they don‚Äôt deserve the discount.

After bypassing multiple FAQs that didn‚Äôt apply to my case, I was able to reach a customer service rep on live chat. The chat disconnected twice. I gave up and emailed. I can‚Äôt say anything negative about the customer service reps, as they all emailed back and being a sales rep myself, I know how hard they work and how taxing it is to deal with people who have bad experiences. The customer service reps were great. But the interface is awful, trying to change personal information on the app is a treasure hunt, and the policy of refunding your money for 24 hours is laughable to say the least. 24 hours would work if I didn‚Äôt have a job, but 48 hours would be more appropriate for people who need to go to work and can‚Äôt shop online while AT work..."

I have use them for outings, places I didn‚Äôt know I wanted to go, but after reading the descriptions and the price being right, we go and always have a good time. I have never once had an incident where I was not totally satisfied. There was one time I did not read the fine print, and the cost of shipping was a little too high for me, so I contacted Groupon right away and traded in my vouchers and everything was just fine. I would definitely recommend Groupon."
211,Groupon Victim,"August 4, 2018",1,"Total Crap Groupon has the WORST customer service out of anything I have ever experienced. Great if you can find some deal and use it, but if you have any issues they will leave you high and dry. They make it extremely difficult to find any way to contact them directly to have an issue resolved. Their ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô page dead ends you into FAQs, and offers no direct email or contact method. They hide it intentionally so you cannot find any way to contact them.  When you‚Äôve purchased a $100 Groupon from a company that has gone out of business, it is infuriating when you have no easy way to contact Groupon to resolve the issue and get a refund. I will NEVER, EVER use this app again. It is too high risk and they do not want to help you if you need it. If you‚Äôre shelling out hundreds on a Groupon, be advised if anything goes wrong you‚Äôre screwed. TOTAL GARBAGE!"

I used to order and be very satisfied. No customer service number and no reply. Tried signing in and says they don‚Äôt recognize password. Double checked and tried again.

232,ETBarton,"July 2, 2018",4,"Excellent at getting deals 90% of the time This app is fantastic for getting deals 90% of the time.  The other 10% is usually because a vendor doesn‚Äôt live up to their end of the bargain.  They either don‚Äôt answer their phone or they say they won‚Äôt honor it for some reason or other.  I know that‚Äôs not the app‚Äôs fault, but Groupon will act like you‚Äôre the criminal trying to get a refund if you let them know the Groupon wasn‚Äôt offered.  They will most likely give you credit for a different purchase rather than the refund.  That is why I only give it 4 stars.  If they gave a refund when a customer asks without a problem, then I would give them 5 stars."
233,Reeses76,"August 18, 2018",3,"Great but only if vendor provides what's promised I've typically purchased Groupons to go out and do things with my friends or family and usually it's worked out great. However I recently purchased a Groupon and the vendor cancelled on me twice because they didn't meet a minimum amount of people they wanted for the activity. It was very disappointing but I figured I'd just contact Groupon for a refund. Well not only did I not get a refund, I also was short changed $5 when they exchanged what I paid for with Groupon bucks. That was after dealing with customer service twice. Be weary of vendors who can't provide what's stated. In the future I will call the vendor for additional terms of sale prior to purchasing since Groupon's refund policy isn't great."

Deals and what you get with the deal are not always spell out out thoroughly until after the purchase is already processed. By then, it is too late and I am stuck with something I don‚Äôt want, unless I want to grovel for a refund. Contacting Groupon for a refund is a MAJOR hassle. To make it worse they shame you for asking for the refund, then warn you that no refunds will be available in the future. In other words it is if THEY are doing YOU a favor when actually the refund you are asking for is a result of their lack of communicating what is really available with the offer."

Endless expiration dates would be a real Plus for me, even though the original value is still good, I‚Äôd like the entire amount to stay good. I would definitely buy more if that were true.

What I do not like nor understand is there is no security feature around the ""Buy Now"" option.  Meaning you can select a product and read the description, etc and if you hit ""Buy Now"" even in error, unbeknownst to you you have automatically purchased that product.  There is no ""confirm your order"" or put in a password you have just made a purchase and credit card charged (they have it on file so no reentering of cc info).

Every time I tried to increase the amount from ‚Äú1‚Äù it would reset to ‚Äú1‚Äù and show the price for one ticket.

It wasn‚Äôt until I paid that my buying history reflected the actual price. I ended up with 5 tickets instead of 3 and this overpaid by $50.

That being said; if they don‚Äôt double charge you, cancel items you‚Äôve purchased, or notify you that they are unable to process your order even though they charged it in full, many of the items available beat other pricing and there‚Äôs nothing comparable for local events and activities pricing.

I was unable to understand the agent that called me so I requested an US agent that spoke English. Was placed on hold for 10 minutes before another agent that I also had a hard time understanding who stated that the agents are all outside of the US and I would have to speak with him. I explained that I wanted to exchange and there was a misunderstanding and he said that I would receive a refund. Tried to tell him I wanted to exchange but he said because he sent me a return label that was all he could do. Very rude and raised his vice causing me to do the same. Requested his name but only gave me a first name and refused his last name. Then the call got disconnected and still no label and issue not resolved. This was my first and last order.

Sometimes you should look very close before purchasing if it seems like a really really good deal.

I‚Äôm not saying anyone lies on here but I would look very very close before purchasing something. Some of the refurbished items don‚Äôt work as well as the item originally would have.

255,NicNye,"August 1, 2019",5,"Groupon is pretty legit Although I have had several issues with incomplete orders, that's the vendor's fault, not Groupon...Groupon has refunded my money when their vendors were in the wrong, for the most part, but be sure to read the entirety of the restrictions in the fine print bc I feel Groupon is attacked by people and rated as 1 star by jerks who aren't honest about the fact that they didn't read the rules before purchasing.  So to those people, I say you are ruining it for the rest of us.  Groupon is awesome for local deals and tons of other stuff, especially love the coupon codes.  Keep up the good work, guys"

258,JesOwens,"January 4, 2020",4,"Pretty good app Works relatively well, coupons FOR GROUPON, that you‚Äôre supposed to apply at checkout, often don‚Äôt work because the site doesn‚Äôt give you the opportunity, it often applies the payment when you hit; PROCEED TO CHECKOUT, it‚Äôs supposed to go to a page where you can double check you‚Äôre order and apply promos and coupons. Unfortunately it often does not do that. Kinda shifty and scam-ish if you ask me. But some deal is better than no deal at all so I still use Groupon. I‚Äôd use it a lot more if we had more deals local to me though! I wish they‚Äôd advertise their ‚ÄòGroupon for businesses‚Äô,  in my area more, so there would be more local deals"
259,Macarine,"September 12, 2019",5,"I love It!!! The app and website are brilliant. They give a lot of options for buying deals and some further discounts if you sign up for Groupon plus. I‚Äôve found some really amazing deals on here. And a couple of times, I‚Äôve bought a Groupon that I ended up not needing. They allowed to trade it in for Groupon credits no problem. Be aware that when you return a Groupon, you won‚Äôt get your money refunded to your credit card, but to your Groupon account as Groupon bucks instead. This isn‚Äôt a big deal because they have deals on WIDE range of things, but just FYI. It‚Äôs pretty great. So go forth and Groupon!!"
260,MA0504,"May 9, 2018",1,"Bad first time experience I bought a couple day passes to a fews exhibits here in Seattle, Washington. It turned out one of the places were closed due to remodeling. This turned into a BIG HEADACHE. First it was hard trying to get to customer service. After I finally spoke to someone about trying to get a refund, they said I have to wait 72 hours so they can investigate the problem and after that I have to wait 7-10 business days to get my refund (that‚Äôs even if I get one). First of all they shouldn‚Äôt have sold me passes to a closed exhibit. Now this has become a big inconvenience. I had to buy the tickets for the other places at full price. To me that extra money would of been great to use other things while on vacation. So I recommend you check the place on availability before you purchase the tickets through here."

The coupons are easy to understand and offer a link to website to learn more about the vendor. I have been using it for years on a variety of purchases. There is always a lot of choices and the discounts are great...especially Promo Specials. I've even bought them as gifts. Groupons customer service is wonderful. Recently I made a purchase for something that was misrepresented. I told Groupon about the situation and they gave me a refund.

I contacted Groupon ( which is really hard to talk to a real person ) and they tell me it‚Äôs nothing they can do about it they‚Äôll have to contact the park and see if I‚Äôm lying or not. To add icing to the cake they tell me that in order to even talk to someone who can get my money back It‚Äôll take another 3 business days. I asked to talk to a supervisor and they transferred me over to one. The supervisor told me it‚Äôs nothing he can do either. I asked if I can send of pictures of the sign showing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs closed. His response to me was ‚Äú that‚Äôs not how it works ‚Äú. So not only did I waste 6 hours of gas, I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm getting my money back for my family tickets."

Or at times, stock up on those gym socks or other needs while the price is right.  Might not be wonderful to fill up your house with deals you really did not need, but if you don‚Äôt know that already, let someone wiser help you manage your money ... or take a financial reality course like ‚ÄúFinancial Peace University‚Äù, because peace always wins over STUFF in the long haul, and they won‚Äôt repossess your car, refrigerator, or your marriage (so to speak).

To me I find it fun to shop, especially since I'm home bound. Mostly because I have such a variety of things to choose from.

269,Susanmoji,"September 2, 2019",5,"Great deals and services Groupon is a great way to try something before committing - I have used numerous deals for fitness activities, to see if the type and facility is a good match for me. I also use the hotel deals often, and have not been disappointed - the Groupon description is an accurate representation of the properties I have stayed at. Groupon goods are usually well worth it - occasionally disappointing, but the customer service when reporting issues has been great. Recommend joining the member program- an extra 25% off on most purchases is well worth the monthly fee ($4.99)."
270,Cosmic xx Valerie,"March 19, 2018",3,"Unfortunate reviewing issue I absolutely LOVE Groupon. There's so many sales that are excellent for all occasions. One BIG issue I've realized is that when I try to leave a review, I cannot see what I am typing because of the ""add photo"" box. This really bothers me because I want to leave legitimate reviews but how can I do that without editing any possible errors I may have made while typing. I can't copy and paste or move around in the text box whatsoever. I have an iPhone 4 so maybe I'm missing an update but I feel like this could be easily fixed. Until then, I won't leave any reviews on the products I buy and I'm feeling kind of sad about that. Please fix and I will gladly fix this review to be 5 stars instead."

The only bad thing I found is that some things like ON protein for example says like normal price 120$ and discount price at 57$ for anybody who is familiar we all know that that's the normal price haha.. and the fact they show a picture of 3 when you Are only getting one is kinda dumb"

I usually use it for restaurants. I‚Äôve literally found places that changed my life and became my favorites. The most important thing I‚Äôve learned is to make sure to visit the restaurant/business before the expiration date, as I‚Äôve bought quite a few Groupons that ended up expiring (though they are still worth the value paid). That is one thing they need to change - create a method to trade in unused vouchers for different ones."

Today, I dropped a case that I really like and just got last week, so I went on Groupon to see what they could do for me and the nice customer service issues a refund on Groupon bucks so I could buy the same or another case of my choice.

I had not received a product that I‚Äôd ordered a couple months before and have had products take a while to get to me in the past. When I called when I realized I had never received it, I was told it was obviously not available now.

Groupon also offers new membership packages to my favorite Pilates Studio, so as a psychotherapist I can encourage  my therapy clients to try an effective exercise workout for weight loss, muscle toning, cardio, strength and flexibility at a very low cost that makes it a bargain to explore an exercise program they wouldn‚Äôt do otherwise."

Retailers treat you the same as they treat any other customer.   Groupon is also great to use for pest control and maintaining your heat pump.

Although it probably goes without saying, one should do his/her homework before making purchases on Groupon, because a lot of times there are better prices elsewhere for the same item. That said, the times I‚Äôve had issues with receiving an item, either arriving late, damaged in the mail, or just not being what was expected, Groupon customer service has always made it right by being prompt, professional, and reliable.

There seems to be a lack of communication within your whole organization. From the vague descriptions in your fine print, to the businesses that you enlist on your app; The experience I had with Groupon was more of a burden than a blessing. Furthermore, I would like to add that your customer service is slightly difficult to navigate, especially when speaking to persons who try to move me out of their line like cattle. I am thankful that Francis was there to help, but I feel bad for the majority of others who are not helped like I was."

The lack of the 5th star is with them being a 3rd party shipper, getting problem solving with the merchandiser can be tricky but with practice and reading it is possible a little unconventional but worth it.  Great for holiday shopping and lazy gift givers.  Great way to sample some classes or careers online and directly like gyms concerts.  Download and you won‚Äôt be disappointed, unless you don‚Äôt like saving money.  I don‚Äôt work for them nor have I been given anything from them besides what I ordered and a trustworthy app that helps with my chronic shopping."

The fact that I continue to purchase from them says it all. The services such as massages, pedicures, facials, etc are quite good. Restaurant discounts can't be beat. But make sure you always read the specifics of the deal. One mistake I made was to purchase a deal to have color, cut, and styling at the salon I had been going to regularly only to find that it stated in the rules of the deal that it had to be your first visit to the salon. So be sure to read the rules of the deal."

I recommend Groupon to others! My products generally arrive within a few days or vouchers are available within moments of purchases.

First of all it‚Äôs really frustrating when you are on the app and want to contact customer service but the options you get is just FAQs. Second of all Groupon use to notify you when you‚Äôre Groupons is about to expire or on the day it expires but for the recent Groupons I have been purchasing I did not get any notification and they just become expired. By the time I check it‚Äôs too late I don‚Äôt even have an option to trade it in for something else. Or, for the most recent one, when I open it it says I can extend it one time but when I hit extend it says sorry you can‚Äôt extend anymore. This is total BS. I‚Äôm so done with Groupon.

She is very careful and listens to your request.  I have since gone to her a second time with the same results.  I recommended her to a friend and she thanked me numerous times for the referral. Her location is close to home and am very confident with my services."

From dinner to spa tickets, to a night or two in a hotel, Groupon have saved us money in more ways than I expected. 5 star for sure. Just make sure to read the fine print, as you always should, before purchasing, because sometimes you need to purchase the Groupon at least 24 hours before you can use it; holidays are also something to be aware as they tend to be ‚Äúblack out dates‚Äù when no groupons or coupons are accepted, no biggie. Still rad."

309,stacyb94,"August 7, 2019",1,"Stacyb Three times I received an email invitation to purchase pay $10 for $20 Regal e-certificate. However, every time I tried to purchase the Groupon I would get an error message saying that the Groupon is available by invitation only. This happened to 2 other people I know as well and so I requested a Groupon Representative call me back. I got a call back over an hour later and the representative‚Äôs explanation is that the Groupon is sold out. Well you are getting back to me almost 2 hours later so of course it is. Groupon offered an explanation no Groupon on bucks to make up for it. Groupon‚Äôs customer service is horrible you have to wait for a Customer Service Rep to call you back hours later, a Supervisor days later and your issue may not get resolved. Groupon deserves zero stars at this time."

One day I received promos to couple night ideas and went for it for my hubby‚Äôs birthday and I have been hooked every since. If it‚Äôs flying through your email, grab it! Best thing I could have ever done!!! Soooo affordable and easy to use!!! Just make sure you are reading the fine print and call if you have questions or don‚Äôt understand! Happy grouponing!!!!"
311,Littlenut,"August 30, 2018",3,"Buyer beware!!! For the most part Groupon is a great place to get things you normally wouldn't buy or even think about buying. Customer service is NOT THE BEST!! On one purchase they sent me whatever they wanted to!! And the price was a lot cheaper than what I ordered originally. Then it was up to me to spend my time to repackage it, then mail it back and wait for them at Groupon to acknowledge they received it to refund me the money. If they run a respectable business they KNEW what they sent me was WRONG or they aren't keeping up with their inventory and should have IMMEDIATELY sent out the RIGHT product to make THEE CUSTOMER HAPPY!!! THEY HAVE WAY WAY WAY TO MANY EXCUSES OR REASONS WHY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT RIGHT FOR THE CUSTOMER!!! Good luck shopping. Be CAREFUL."

I contacted them and I told them that I hadn‚Äôt seen that that it had shipped yet, and I was concerned. They told me that there was nothing they could do, these things happen and now my team was out of stock so I couldn‚Äôt get it.  They issued me a $10 credit for my trouble, but all I really wanted was the item. It bothers me that no one contacts you to let you know that they‚Äôre not shipping something.  You have to just keep checking and follow up even if it says it will ship within a specific time."

We‚Äôll unfortunately that park weeny out of business before I was able to use my discount. I simply contacted customer service via email explained the situation and within minutes a full refund was issued to my account.

318,don't do it...,"December 22, 2019",3,"So-So Sometimes the deals are worthwhile and sometimes they are worthless. Most of the ones offering a discount on things like eyeglasses are a scam with no real savings over what those companies offer without the Groupon hassle. Others have so many restrictions that they‚Äôre almost impossible to use - like some of the dining, massages and nail services. There are so many sold that you can‚Äôt get an appointment or reservation. Then some are totally worth it and you feel like you‚Äôre getting a good deal. I am also annoyed that the ‚Äúextra savings codes‚Äù don‚Äôt work in many instances. Shop carefully and you may get a good deal. Buy without research and you‚Äôre not going to be happy."

Because you cannot trade in a deal if you have and it‚Äôs difficult to get customer service to even ask about it. So buyer beware. I may continue to still have dealings with Groupon in the future, but this would have been very helpful to know beforehand. Also I wouldn‚Äôt buy refurbished electronics. I bought a refurbished IPad once, great deal but wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I had to return it."

Having both Multiple Sclerosis and Fibromyalgia makes touch quite painful sometimes. But Sara S. adjusts her pressure as needed. For that, I am grateful. And Groupon allows me to frequent her studio once a month to keep my muscles toned. I‚Äôm convinced massage enables my mobility w/o any assistants or wheelchairs. Again, thank you, Sara & Groupon, for keeping me upright & walking after 34 years of living w/ these challenges."

Finally was able to create the collage and after several hours I go to check out and the site tells me my Groupon has expired even though i still had months left. The merchant was unreachable so I reached out to Groupon and the rep was snotty with me. Worst customer service I have ever received.

I recently signed up for Groupon Select and have already saved more money in one month than the whole six month membership costs.

328,milesmiokie,"March 29, 2020",5,"Review Groupon has great deals some better than others. I have found however that if you buy some of the products you have to go thru the company itself, saying that some of the product I‚Äôve bought and paid for I‚Äôve never received and never will I don‚Äôt have the capacity to do that and I didn‚Äôt receive the money back. I‚Äôve been charged for things I never bought and couldn‚Äôt get my money back.

I received the item, and it had the wrong stones. I even double checked that I had made the correct selection when placing my order. Then I went to the area to get help with my order, and the only option was to return the item. Long story short, after contacting customer service (which was a feat in itself), they told me that I could have done an exchange if I had gone through the website. I only ever use Groupon through the app. The return/exchange process should be much more clear. The customer service leaves much to be desired."

The good part is when you have shopped around and you know that the Groupon is a good deal and it works. Beware of Raw deals like paying $7.99 for the merchandise and $8.99 to ship it. Or buying from criminal companies who attach excessive fees, by the time you finish you've paid 2X over and it's no longer a deal. Nonetheless, when you do the research and land a good deal it is really worth it as long as it's a need and not a want.

When I contacted customer service, all they could do was direct me to print out the groupon that I have purchased, hence the surprise was ruined. This is very disappointing.

Beware that many restaurants automatically charge a high service charge (20%+) which takes much of your savings amount.

359,reesecupp imusic,"December 5, 2019",3,"Customer Service I like Groupon but customer service is the worst!  The absolute worst.  You can't contact them and get a live person and they had me typing messages only to be redirected to another support site that cost $1 but thereafter after a monthly charge for a ridiculous mat I can't recall right now.  I ended up canceling my order BC I could not get some decent help to rectify my situation.  I needed to change the shipping address to the new address and the fine print read if you pay using pay pal you cannot update, you must contact customer support which is a bulls hit support.  Thank God for #PayPal, BC they answer my call and guided me through resolution."
360,JAROB66,"February 23, 2018",5,"I Love Groupon! Groupon has helped me try services that I otherwise would have thought were out of reach. I‚Äôve had amazing concerts, laser hair removal, tech gadgets, Christmas presents, restaurant events, and even massage/stretch therapy. I‚Äôm always pleasantly surprised how easy Groupon is to use, even in other states! The rare time where I didn‚Äôt receive the item, they were able to track the issue and credit my account, they‚Äôve proven their trustworthiness. I think it is an excellent way to support local business and smart for them to reach new clients. In sum: I LOVE Groupon!"
361,genee#1,"May 25, 2018",4,"Review I really like the things that Groupon has to offer. However, there are some things that they refused to return when it says that if it‚Äôs defective you can return it and they haven‚Äôt let me. Sometimes when you get a customer service agent who has no patience they will stop to chat before I can get my question out. However I have had some customer service agents that have been wonderfully kind. I do not know why I am not receiving my points on my order, maybe after this I will start receiving my points.  I still enjoy seeing what they have to offer and ordering."

International Open Academy was having a fabulous sale on Groupon that couldn‚Äôt  be beat! The course took me a week to complete and what I loved is that it is fully accredited so you can go anywhere in the world and the certificate is recognized. They give you the e-certificates free. Immediately after obtaining my certificate, I was employed, and have been working from home. I love it! Highly recommend this course! Several friends and family have purchased it too."

In the process of buying something , it automatically used a credit card, which I was not sure, was still valid. Hard to tell even, if I had actually bought the item. Then hard to figure out how to check that I actually did. Glad there is a PayPal choice, which I only noticed on my 2nd purchase of the evening. I really think that on the first purchase it did not show up as a choice.I haven‚Äôt had this much trouble navigating a purchase in a long time, if ever"

But then I decided to talk to someone on chat and they helped me out so that I could trade my Groupon in for something else and get Groupon bucks for the restaurant that closed. Rather than losing $35 I was able to buy two groupons I actually needed and wanted in less than 1 hour. I really appreciate their support and superb customer service! Highly recommend!

Be sure to always read the fine print and if seems too good to be true, really double check the deal and the website of the offer...call them and ask to verify they are running the deal.

At check out I entered the gift card information including the gift card pin and instead of taking the gift card they charged my credit card. I asked them to reverse the credit card charge and apply the gift card. Instead they converted the gift card to groupon bucks. So now instead of a $200 purchase from Groupon, I have spent $400. No way to get the credit card charge removed. I could return the vacuum cleaner at my own cost to ship. What a scam! Didn‚Äôt help that the customer service is in India and there is no way to actually speak to a human being. I will spend down my $200 in groupon bucks, close my account and say goodbye to groupon.

I tried contacting customer service but I got stuck in an ongoing loop of selecting the option for customer service, selecting the item that I want help with then back to selecting the option for customer service.

The app makes it easy to buy by registering a credit card you just tap ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and link to touch payment and purchase is done!

Once again not a big deal I‚Äôll just call customer support and explain the situation. WRONG they do not have customer support there is not a single email or phone number in the entire app. I refuse to use this thing ever again because it made me waste $50 and you bet I will tell everyone back home in Montana not to use it when they travel as well.

Instead you‚Äôre directed to a virtual center where you send messages online with someone who is supposed to help.

Unfortunately, the agent on Live Chat was not able to resolve my issue. She asked me to use my computer or an app on the phone rather than using my iPad. My desktop computer is not yet set up.

They did nothing to help resolve to issue whether it was them issuing the voucher I never received or issuing a refund. After spending over an hour on the phone all I got was an I‚Äôm sorry we can‚Äôt do anything about it, maybe you should call your bank and report the transaction as fraud. ü§îüßê if I made the purchase how is it fraud? All I wanted was the voucher I NEVER received and or a refund directly from Groupon."
413,redddsh,"March 7, 2019",1,Rip off 1st of all let me start with this... if you need a refund or so. There is no number to dial. :) so you have to email or chat. I‚Äôve done 2 purchases with Groupon. And both times I‚Äôve had issues. I got one for a wax don‚Äôt get me wrong they have good deals but then you can‚Äôt use your vouchers sometimes til you‚Äôre trying to redeem them. I went got my service and they tell me they don‚Äôt do Groupon at that location. It didn‚Äôt specify that... 2nd I tried buying Sheri‚Äôs Strawberries and I followed the instructions. And came to find out. The voucher wasn‚Äôt applied and I couldn‚Äôt get my refund back. :D Priyanka on the chat told me to give the voucher to someone else. So SCREW THIS app. I rather pay full price for anything than to later find out it doesn‚Äôt work properly
414,zopynie,"March 23, 2019",5,There are some really great deals to be had‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had a lot of great experiences and saved a lot of money using Groupon‚Ä¶ There have been a few glitches‚Ä¶ Like when merchants decide they will no  longer want to  accept Groupon‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs happened with a few restaurants and with the river boat queen in Edmonton‚Ä¶ For the most part it‚Äôs painless you just contact Groupon and they refund your money‚Ä¶ I think whenever you have a night out planned or an event planned to check Groupon first‚Ä¶ You will be surprised ...there may be a savings!
415,7r1sh,"April 6, 2019",2,"Too early to tell I had a very scary moment yesterday. The app has huge issues! I tried to view details on an international destination and it went right into ‚Äúpurchasing‚Äù without any warning! I mean the app has a defective way to place orders. I couldn‚Äôt stop it when I realized what it was doing. I canceled at the very chance the app allowed me. But in order to confirm it really did it. I had to access the live chat. The rep wrote that it was refunded. But my bank, today still shows the purchase as pending. Then, I reviewed the comments on that travel agency and they are terrible!!!! Why is Groupon allowing this vendor on their site, after so many bad and scary reviews? Please remove that from your app."
416,Bella_mia1982,"May 9, 2019",4,I would give 5 starts but The only reason I give it 4 stars is because some deals are not exactly ‚Äúdeals‚Äù 
417,blueorchid717,"May 19, 2019",4,"Great app! Just wish the deal details were easy to locate after purchase I love this app and enjoy its ease of use and (most of the UI). The only thing I struggle with is the difficulty in locating Deal details after purchase. I have been viewing a lot of offers lately and even for the ones I put hade, it can be hard to track down exactly what is/isn‚Äôt covered with the package. Possible I am doing something wrong but you would think all of the fine print is still available after purchasing the deal. If it weren‚Äôt for that I would rate it a 5."
418,Natalaki101,"March 16, 2020",4,"Expiration to quick Make sure if you buy any of the  photo  book groupons you use them quickly. I bought 3 photo books & they expired.

I did buy a  ‚Äúput you‚Äôre print on a decorative wooden frame ‚Äú, and that was very nice but takes a lot less time as you‚Äôre only using 1 photo. I‚Äôve bought some jewelry and clothing which were nice. All in all I think Groupon is great for certain finds and it‚Äôs always great to save money."

I couldn‚Äôt believe the adult items w/ very detailed descriptions & pictures that she was able to see!  Nowhere does it say this is an explicit app or should be supervised!

My only problem is there sometimes misleading partnerships with other companies that promote discounts that are either incredibly hard to fully access these advertised ‚Äúdiscounts‚Äù, or completely impossible to reach their guidelines and it‚Äôs easy to realize that AFTER you‚Äôve made your purchase. Great app; misleading at times, but such is the capitalist mentality to expect nothing less."

I've found great getaways, spa packages, gadgets, shoes and clothes. And food!! I can't imagine the money I've saved on all the 40-50% off deals I've purchased. And the great thing is if I don't use them before they expire, I still get to use the face value I payed at any time because it never expires. If a business closes or no longer accepts Groupon, they will credit you the purchase price in Groupon bucks."
430,Gretchen MT,"May 4, 2018",1,Customer Service is the WORST I have used them for years. Loved some of the deals I have gotten. Twice I have had Groupons marked as Redeemed when I did not use them.

There has never been a purchase that I have had a problem with - even when I‚Äôve bought restaurant coupons and they expired - I didn‚Äôt have a problem redeeming them for the purchase price They advertise every item exactly as it is - not a come-on like the stores do sometimes. If there‚Äôs a limited stock they let you know when you look at the item not when you go to purchase. I‚Äôm a very happy customer
435,Kell L,"September 2, 2018",1,"Awful Service! My Groupon experiences have been atrocious lately! Most recently, they completely failed to help me redeem a multiple hundred dollar Groupon for Xtreme Experience. It was a birthday gift for my fianc√©, so obviously it was important to me. The customer service was so poor that it took hours just to get someone to say they couldn‚Äôt help me with anything at that time. When I tried again a week later to see if I would have better luck with a new representative, that person told me it had just expired. They didn‚Äôt care at all about the fact that I tried to get help before it was expired, and the whole thing ended up costing me a fortune. I definitely hate Groupon now and really wish they had more interest in their customers."

437,sfasig,"March 28, 2019",4,"Beware when purchasing for Live shows/events Some deals are good on the app. However their customer service is subpar. If you purchase a groupon for a live event/show you have to be very careful with your dates. We purchased tickets and checked the venues calendar to make sure it was not a black out date beforehand. Then two days before the event the venue changed the status and we were unable to use our groupons. Groupon would not provide a refund, credit or exchange. There is only a 24 hour refund policy. Not worth it for dates that are subject to changes."
438,ksattler,"September 5, 2019",3,"Good deals, bad UX I went to buy 2 items. They seem like bargains. I could not put them in my cart. I had to buy them separately.

I tried to contact the help desk via chat on the website (I tried both the app and website to see if I could use the cart - nope). The text I was typing was white on grey, barely visible. Then, it was white on white and the send button went off the screen. I remember this app working better before. I got 2 nice deals but it was a pita to get them."

The new ones are not as good of a deal plus you can‚Äôt use the occasional additional 20-25% off offers you make available. I do not like this trend & will not partake of these offers. Keep the traditional Groupons!!! Secondly, how about expanding your variety of traditional restaurant Groupons...there hasn‚Äôt been anything new in my area for months. Thirdly, your customer service on the phone & chat line is horrible. The agents lie & say they will resolve your issue or call you back & they do neither. Email seems to work the best. Why? Pretty poor customer service for a company that now advertises on TV."

I have ordered everything from spa services, restaurants offers and jewelry. I've only had one issue thus far. I ordered a necklace and the gem stone was not attached. I tried to fix it but couldn't. I thought about calling and returning it, but it was $9 and I really didn't want to go through the hassle of going to the post office.

I'm going to really read vendor‚Äôs reviews from now on, because it's been 50/50 for me and that's not a deal. I‚Äôm out $500 or so on these bait and switch scams, and got nothing but nasty emails when I tried to collect my Latisse. It‚Äôs hard to get normal appointments with some vendors as they have special rules for Groupon clients. Groupon makes no apologies for these scams and does not refund your money."

I ask Groupon for my refund ($36) and they tell me to read the fine print . Furthermore, they tell me I‚Äôm not eligible for a trade in or Groupon bucks ! So whatever, I found my way around all of that after complaining to customer service nearly 5x and got to trade in for another Groupon for teeth whitening - yeah random right !

I would have understood the policy regardless of how she said it, but her candor with me was incredibly unprofessional.

It almost had a college dorm feel.... white walls, one dresser, one bed and NOTHING on the walls. We pretty much slept in a white box! The rest of the trip was wonderful and went great! Vouchers were incredibly easy to use! The rental place/hotels already had our names, just like a reservation!"

470,Mahweee,"May 6, 2018",1,Worst customer service ever i purchased a groupon on may 4th hoping to use it on may 6th. the day comes and my groupon still says pending. however the app says available after 24 hrs. i contact customer support and since it‚Äôs the weekend they do not answer their phone. they only do live chat. so i contact live chat and all they say is how to use the app. but the issue is they didn‚Äôt send a barcode. how can i use a voucher without a barcode. then they said i can still use it. i go to the safari park and they couldn‚Äôt let me in without a barcode. i then contacted customer support 3 more times and none of them could help. did i mention that they charged my card and did not send me the barcode and ruined my birthday weekend.

472,Namagrove,"October 23, 2018",3,I love using Groupon. It‚Äôs great when you don‚Äôt have any issues but have come into problems a few time nows with customer service not really being able to fix an issue. I had a groupon that got charged 20 times. When it was only for 1 person and said you could only purchase 1. I had to go through my bank to make sure it was not charged as it only said it went through once. This time I ended up biteing some groupon bucks. So every time I‚Äôve had to deal with them although mostly nice it was difficult and problems were mostly in my hands to deal with or bite the bullet.

I‚Äôm pretty much done with Groupon now since they offer no customer support besides what‚Äôs offered on the app and if you actually manage to find a phone number (I could only find from a blog against Groupon) they won‚Äôt answer on weekends.

I feel safe purchasing through Groupon based on my past experiences.  I‚Äôve received many great values and activity ideas that I would not have thought of doing had Groupon not had the offer. Thank you Groupon!
528,Phx Tech,"September 5, 2019",4,"Groupon is a pretty great service! I‚Äôve been using Groupon for a while and have found some excellent savings from companies I would never have known about.  One company was actually a bust, and once I was able to find out how to contact customer service they refunded the entire amount no problem.  So now I can find a better company and service.  Only four stars because it was difficult getting to a place where I could find the customer service contact.  You can‚Äôt call them directly anymore."
529,Myjump,"June 23, 2019",5,"Great Deals and Incredible Savings We have been Groupon customers for a few years and have been very pleased with all of our purchases.  I am a frugal shopper so I love to get a discounted price when I can.  Groupon makes this possible with so many different things.  We can go out to eat and save money, I can have my carpets cleaned and save money, and I can buy goods and save.  These are just a few examples of the many ways Groupon has saved me money.  I highly recommend Groupon."
530,Jules the Writer,"March 12, 2018",5,"Great deals & service! I've had Groupon for about 2.5 years now, and it's great! My first purchase was a DLSR camera from Groupon goods that I still use, followed by a pair of $100 boots for $30 that lasted through 2 years of heavy use. Lately I've mostly used Groupon for ""Local Deals"" like restaurants, and it's awesome! It lets me & my boyfriend try new places regularly without breaking the bank. The app is easy to navigate, and I love the ""Saved Deals"" and ""Recently Viewed Deals"" feature. Highly recommend."
531,Beachgirlforever33,"April 2, 2018",5,"One of my favorite apps! I‚Äôm always using Groupon to stretch my budget. I can always find lots of fun things to do with the family, an affordable spa day for me or an experience gift for out of town friends/family. Lately I‚Äôve purchased goat yoga, picture books for graduation gifts, cabana rentals for an upcoming vacation, and a month of unlimited spa days with an additional 20% off already discounted Groupon rates! Thanks for helping this mom super stretch the family budget and still have a budget to treat myself. üíï"
532,Shastime,"April 14, 2018",5,"Very pleased With the exception of 1 item, which I think was my misconception of the quality of it, I have been quite pleased with the value of the products featured in the Groupons I have purchased. This also applies to the jewelry. All the restaurants featured give us the opportunity to try someplace new that perhaps we wouldn't have tried, whether due to the original price or unfamiliar with the location. Happy to have access to this app. Have recommended it to many others!"
533,Ashley Marie Taylor,"May 16, 2018",5,"Self-Titled Groupon Queen I use Groupon for everything, and I tell everyone I know to use it also! I save so much money on things I couldn‚Äôt afford on a regular basis- especially when there are sales. I use Groupon every time I get my nails done and need an oil change, and gifts for family. I buy restaurant, massage and spa Groupons for my mom every year. I do my research before buying based on great reviews so I almost always have a good experience. Also great to promote and support local business, and for travel!"
534,hazelbell2,"May 20, 2018",4,satisfaction Generally speaking I am satisfied with the products I have purchased from Groupon unfortunately there have been several times when the shipping was almost as much as the item itself and unfortunately I didn't catch that so shame on me return on certain things is not possible so make sure you read the fine print But all in all have been satisfied with the product save received and the quality would definitely continue using Groupon and recommend to all my friends
535,donalyn,"August 17, 2018",5,"Awesome Savings I love saving money and I get the best deals with Groupon. It‚Äôs so easy to find high quality restaurants and I‚Äôve discovered a few new favorites using Groupon. It‚Äôs risk free because even if your Groupon Expires, it is still worth what you paid. You can also trade-in the value of an expired Groupon to be credited toward a new Groupon so there is no way you can lose. Even the cash back deals are a great value and the credit automatically appears right on your credit card.  Easy peasy."
536,Sifnoschick,"August 28, 2018",5,"Great deals - most of the time. I love Groupon and have bought many items over the years but one word of caution: it's important to know the original cost of the item you're interested in.  On a few occasions, the ""original"" cost of the item on Groupon was much more than the original cost of the item in stores. As I said, that has happened only a few times.  Generally there are great deals.  The return process is easy and the shipping is often free."
537,MommaShine2all,"October 17, 2018",5,"Groupon I have a large family and Groupons literally the only reason we get to do some activities! I have used it to purchase fun activities to do with family, activities with my buddies making it possible for us to enjoy Kid free Mom nights with adults and even bday gifts for friends.

I also recently purchased a ladder and it went directly to to my account payment no allowing it into my cart letting me to make an additional purchase to to save on shipping or delete the purchase all together.  What is the problem with your software.  It is getting like gambling to see which way it goes when I use your site."

Quick, Effective = Happy Customer I had a product that i ordered that got returned to the sender and i was bummed of the issues i would have to go trough to get it resent or a refund. After 1 min of a online chat with a representative i got a full refund in Groupon Bucks to spend on other items in the app. Which was great because I love the deals. Only down side it might be a little harder if you need the refund in other forms, but im sure with harder trying can probably get done."
540,ReachiRen,"February 26, 2018",5,"A Must Try! Groupon is easier to maneuver and great on prices. I end up trying new things and places for a decent price. While some are worth it, some are not but definitely gives you a head start on trying to things and places. Groupon also gives you discount codes on top their existing promotions and offers. Im addition, it gives you the availability to track certain items you previously liked until a better offer comes along."

My delivery dates are on the mark with the right amount of notifications. I have recommended this sight to family, friends and coworkers   I would add that I have not bought from any seller to date that sold me anything other than what I expected.  Sadly that has not the case with some other sites I‚Äôve used.  Great job Groupon, you have a loyal customer here."

Then when I went back to update my payment for the item I was trying to purchase the transaction failed.  Even though I had updated my payment info.  I ended up going through PayPal to use the same exact card to pay for the item.  If this app is going to be so buggy or user resistant, than I can just delete it and use the web.  Or not even purchase through Groupon."

When I went through Groupon to get a refund. The ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù agent told me that she could extend my Groupons expiration date which doesn‚Äôt help me as I would no longer be pregnant at that point and the photographer does not do newborn photos. The agent in the chat said ‚Äúthank you for helping our local business while saying again she can extend my Groupons expiration date. So annoyed and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair I cannot get money back if O can‚Äôt use the service I purchased & do not like how the agent did not care .

The credit was done instantly and I was able to purchase other things with the amount I paid for the spa day and was very happy about it all.
546,Catv55,"January 8, 2020",2,"Good until you have to return something I have had good experiences with Groupon until I needed to exchange an item that was a Christmas gift. Groupon sent me the wrong item and I couldn‚Äôt get a replacement before Christmas for a 6 year old girl. Instead of giving her nothing , I gave her the item that was sent in error. I tried contacting customer service which is only in a chat online and the only options they gave me wouldn‚Äôt get the item to me in time. I would have hoped they would make it right since it was their error but that was not the case and I was NEVER allowed to talk to a person. Very disappointed with customer service"

I can find items to give as gifts, a lower price on activities for couples, singles and kids.....just so many choices!!!!!  AND, you can find things in your city or even another city you may be going to!!!!  It‚Äôs pretty amazing !"
548,JenR_76,"September 17, 2019",4,"Love Groupon...great deals! I use Groupon a lot and for the most part, and I absolutely love it. It‚Äôs so easy in almost every way. The only issue I have with it is that if I buy a deal and then end up not being able to use it due to whatever reason, I should always be able to trade it in, even after its expiration date and even after I view the voucher. I paid the money, but since it wasn‚Äôt redeemed with the merchant I shouldn‚Äôt be tied to that merchant. I want to be able to trade in my expired Groupons for totally different/new deals."
549,Gizmoson21,"September 1, 2019",4,"Great I am really amazed at all the offers Groupon has AND all the special discounts on top.  I was only disappointed in one order. They sent it to the wrong address. I had to pay for extra shipping. When I told Groupon they informed me I would get an email back from a service rep within 24 hours. I was reached out to 72 hours later and, even though they know my shipment was resent, they would not credit my account until I showed a bill. I have to turn in the postal notice and I paid cash. It‚Äôs üò©$20 I‚Äôll never get back."

552,liljohnbangbang,"November 16, 2018",4,Great app! Super helpful Groupon is awesome in the fact that you get amazing deals! However some items described may be a bit over described as well. I‚Äôve not had any issues with Groupon but dealing with the problem of who gives the Groupon is an issue. I‚Äôve had issues with certain oil changing places I‚Äôve bought from and will no longer return to that business but it‚Äôs learning from experience where not to go and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt penalize Groupon for the issue... again awesome app and I definitely recommend!
553,DailyAff,"March 8, 2019",5,"Great Value I‚Äôve been using Groupon on and off for years.  I use it mostly for restaurants.  Because of Groupon, I‚Äôve been introduced to and tried restaurants that turned out to become some of our favorites.  How can you not like getting $50 of food for only $25?  Oh, I‚Äôve used it for spa services as well - specifically, reflexology.  Reflexology has now become a twice monthly appointment for me because of its stress reducing and healing components.   And who doesn‚Äôt like a good deal?  Thanks, Groupon!!"
554,jentheappliance,"July 20, 2019",1,"Okay deals, horrible customer service Groupon sometimes has good deals. But they take advantage of both the companies that use them by barely giving them enough to break even (if that!) and of their customers. "

556,Jupitercrash59,"March 15, 2020",5,Great app! Groupon allows people to try things they normally wouldn‚Äôt by giving a great discount. There are many many small businesses that I now frequent because I found them from Groupon. Groupon‚Äôs customer service is also really great. If you have an issue with any vendor they are quick to address and resolve the issue. I definitely recommend. This is great for parents who are looking for activities for their kids or are looking for hotel accommodations.

I went on to Groupon today specifically because they are offering 25% off on all offers...or so it would appear, until I bought something and that 25% off was not applied.

Had phone issues and canceled an order when I tried to reach order the deal I had reached the amount of times I could purchase it although ultimately never got to use that deal and had to find a different deal that was similar.

I think I‚Äôll look into buying stock in this company...üòÇüòÇ Just be careful buying jewelry because it will occasionally come damaged.  My best advice is: if they offer a service plan (warranty) get the 2 yr plan especially if you are buying real gold, or sterling silver (the only metals I buy)."

I have started checking regularly to see if things I like to do are listed or restaurants in the area that I will be in are listed and choose from the list.  I wish there were more listings for things to do. It doesn‚Äôt seem to change very often but that has more to do with the businesses than Groupon. Thanks Groupon for providing such a great service!

It feels awesome to be back!! "

Most of the time the products are legit, great quality, and exactly as advertised.  There have been a few times when the products showed up and weren‚Äôt exactly as they looked, but cheap enough that it didn‚Äôt matter.  In most cases you really should research the pricing.  At times you can get better pricing on other known sites. "

We have booked numerous vacations and events over the years through Groupon and have always been satisfied with the price the quality and the customer service. Whenever we aren‚Äôt able to make a reservation they always give credit to use later which is a huge plus for a busy family. We just finally redeemed a hotel voucher we bought a few years ago and got full value.

Their customer support is fantastic. Any business where I‚Äôve redeemed a Groupon is familiar with process making it easy to use. Sometimes I have to get assistance on printing or redeeming a voucher. I get to many offers to look at them, it will say I have 76 suggestions and than maybe 99 in 45 minutes."

Yes, I have been disappointed once out of the many wonderful products and services that I have bought but the pain would have been much worse if I had paid the full retail price instead of the special pricing made possible by Groupon. I strongly recommend Groupon as a way of acquiring the things you want and sometimes need instead of the traditional brick and motor retail store experience."
594,newstart#1,"May 30, 2019",1,Mobile site terrible Your customer service and mobile site or so not working properly. I‚Äôve tried multiple times to adjust my account on your mobile app does not work went trying to enter delivery billing information. Customer service following is basically reading office script that doesn‚Äôt allow a good connection and comes across as unhelpful. Having agents go through a one through 10 list of did you do this or that is very insulting when the customer service representative is it even listening to your customers main focus and concern. I have purchased a lot from Groupon but situations like this make me consider ending my Purchasing future with your company
595,Drop2468,"March 8, 2020",5,Fewer 50% off deals but still great! I use Groupon for restaurant deals. Always good. Seems like 50% off was standard but now I'm seeing a lot of 33-40% off. I skip those. Not worth the effort unless it's a significant savings. But they do have promotions pretty regularly where it will be ‚Äúsave an extra 25%‚Äù or whatever. I jump on those and have ALWAYS had a good experience in the restaurant. Servers see Groupons all the time and they don‚Äôt blink an eye. Just please remember to tip on the pre-Groupon price.
596,DDHOhio,"December 4, 2019",4,"Love to save money Groupon brings good deals to you in about every category you need. The transactions are easy to complete and customer service has been exceptional. I bought a service that I could not use earlier this year and they were understanding and refunded my purchase in Groupon bucks to use later. The only time I have not been completely satisfied is when I used Groupon for concert tickets. The seats were assigned for me. They were ok but I would have chosen differently. Overall, I am very happy with Groupon."

I‚Äôm able to find amazing deals with easy to understand instructions on how to redeem the vouchers. I also love that if you have a change of heart in a voucher you purchased, you can trade it in for the value towards a different deal!! Groupon has broadened my horizons and has been helping me make it possible to check off experiences on my bucket list with in a budget!! I just purchased skydiving!!! ü§©ü§©"
598,Jmmcc4,"July 13, 2019",2,"Bait and Switch The Groupon listing says 8 bulbs for $12. The order page said the same, but when I went to order $12 was the price for 4.  I chatted with a customer serviced rep and then with the supervisor. While patient and polite, neither seemed to understand that this was an instance of bait and switch.  The supervisor said that they (Groupon) never advertised 8 for $12.  This is so not true!"
599,MichelleG34,"July 12, 2019",4,"Awesome deals! Needs a wish list or buy later option Just wish they had a wish list or save it for later option for when you don‚Äôt want to buy right now. It would also be more convenient if the shipping price was added in to the buy price so you don‚Äôt have to search every time for what the total price will be. Be careful because sometimes the price is doubled after adding shipping. I am a Groupon Select member which usually gives you free shipping but not always, So "

We‚Äôve been using Groupon for years now, and regularly look for places and restaurants to try out, return to, and we always search when we are going out of town and it gives us great ideas for places to try and things to do! Saves us a ton and the customer service has been fantastic and efficient the few times I have reached out to them, out of the hundreds of times we have used Groupon!"

I always find Groupon to have an excellent variety of goods/services, I get great pricing and fast shipping plus, if what you ordered is not true to its description, and or the product is defective, it can easily be returned. Another feature that I appreciate is the question and answer regarding a product that is up for sale; this feature has helped in making the decision to purchase or not purchase a particular item. I am a  Groupon junkie and happy to be one!!"
604,Savy Girl,"July 1, 2018",2,"Groupon‚Äôs Customer Service is Terrible I‚Äôve had great luck with the numerous Groupons I‚Äôve purchased over the years and there have been many. However, I can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs been 2 years that I emailed Groupon about a FW Star Telegram subscription I was never able to redeem. I‚Äôve been trying to do so for 2 years. I followed the instructions on the Groupon and when I didn‚Äôt receive the paper, I contacted the paper. They in turn said I needed to contact Groupon. Groupon has never respond to an email so that I could redeem my voucher. So, for that I give them 2 stars and hope no one else has experienced such poor service and list some cash."

I usually do it through Facebook, but when I clicked the option nothing happened.  Same thing through Google.  It was extremely difficult to place this order and if the deal wasn‚Äôt so good, I would‚Äôve just given up earlier.  I also really love the shampoo and conditioner I purchased so I persisted, but it was one of the most annoying experiences just trying to make this purchase that should be easy.  I‚Äôm also a very patient person, too."

The service providers are both courteous and friendly. They encourage the use of your Groupon coupons, because most of them use it as a fundamental part of their advertising. I encourage everyone to try Groupon at least once.I think you‚Äôll become a customer for life!"

When we arrived, there was a sign stating that the business was no longer accepting Groupon certificates. This was between the business and Groupon. We followed all instructions thoroughly. I contacted Groupon for a refund. At first the person told me no, but upon my insistence since this was NOT my problem, she agreed. It has been well over a month. No refund. I contacted Groupon again. This time I was told that my case had to be ""escalated"". If I purchased a certificate and the business would not accept it, my money should be returned. Period Be aware consumers."
608,Chosen0425,"September 4, 2018",4,Rate Groupon I really enjoy the great discounts/savings offered. The only problem that I have had is with the provider standing behind their product or having a difficult time scheduling an appointment for a service. The reason for the four star is Groupon doesn‚Äôt get involved with mediating to help customers resolve any problem they may have with the provider. I have found them to defer to the customer to work any issues out with the provider eve though the customer has already tried and failed.
609,Zamway,"September 10, 2018",5,"Customer Barbara I have been using GroupOn for several years and have never been disappointed.  My purchases are mostly clothes, face & body products including manicures & pedicures.  I learned about GroupOn from my husband who uses it for restaurants, haircuts, car detailing, oil changes, sports, Escape Room which we used for groups, golf, etc.  I would also like to point out, they are very easy to work with if there is a problem.  I highly recommend using GroupOn..."
610,Christine Cochran,"March 8, 2018",4,Products Groupon is great for sharing deals. The problem is more with the sellers. Often times they advertise something for a price but when you go to redeem it they then tell you about all the extra charges for this or that. Charges others do. It get charged if they go in without a Groupon. The sellers should have to post a disclaimer if there are additional charges for something that ‚Äúhas to be done‚Äù in order to receive the service you paid for that would normally be included.
611,vhamidreza,"November 23, 2018",1,Worst customer service ever! I ordered an ipad two days before Thanksgiving and everything seemed to work. On the Black Friday I went to check the status of my order and the website kept telling me that my password is wrong! Even though I was 100% sure that my password is correct I tried to reset my password and it said that there is no account associated with that email address!! This is ridiculous. 
612,Gal 522,"January 30, 2019",4,"Great deals on services and activities! I have enjoyed food, haircuts, and a couple of activities through Groupon. I have not run into issues using the discounts. I was only disappointed once, when I learned that a discounted Mani-pedi could only be used at very specified times. I had purchased three, thinking I could gift two to friends and we would go together. That wasn't possible. I enjoyed mine, but had to give the others to my friends to use at their convenience, rather than having a girl's day out?"
613,Jizjaw,"February 11, 2019",5,"Great on Every Level I‚Äôve scored some seriously sweet and surprisingly satisfying deals thru Groupon, particularly on clothing items (which can be particularly problematic when ordering online). The quality of their offerings seems well-researched and has been consistent. The activity and automotive purchases I‚Äôve made have also met that same mark of verified value that continues to garner my respect and trust for the Groupon marketplace overall. So yeah... Thanks for the deals and keep on keepin‚Äô on, Groupon!"

616,Conhoward,"April 27, 2020",5,Groupon Most things I have ordered from this website have been great the only thing I have had a problem with has been when ordering a class ring which I tried several different times over the past several years and they have kept my money and I never received the class ring so I avoid that product because I don‚Äôt have the money to keep being cheated out of both money and the product.

Museums, shows, art galleries, etc. Sometime the web sites don't cooperate as they should. The last time I ordered 2 tickets to a performance I got charged 14 times for those tickets and I had to call my credit card company and Groupon to fix the problem. It makes me apprehensive about ordering tickets to an event. I'm real happy with purchases made, though. Never a problem there."

Well, IM GOING TO IGNORE THAT VOICE IN MY HEAD & hope for the best! Great products, great prices. If my items come in: on time & in good shape, I'll be a Groupon lifer.   Merry Christmas!

623,Jada's music,"August 7, 2018",4,Love it again I have been a Groupon member for years. Last year I stopped ordering from them because I wasn't receiving the items that I ordered. I went through this three times before Groupon told me that they would not refund me for the lost item.... Even though I never received it. I finally started ordering from them again and they seem to be on point again. Every item that I have ordered has been shipped in a timely manner and I am actually receiving my items. I hope this continues.

625,Viv/Liz,"November 9, 2018",2,Refund to trade in. I finally got my trade but I didn‚Äôt like the fact that I had to keep emailing to get it. Groupon should really have a customer service person that you can speak to or at least live chat with instead of constantly having to keep emails back-and-forth. It would be so much nicer to speak to a real person and solve the issue that way instead of having to type an email each time. I feel like the company is keeping their customers at bay by not having anyone to speak to when they have an issue. That‚Äôs my only issue with Groupon. I really love using Groupon because it saves me a lot of money.

Lately my wife has had an issue where the items that are in her shopping cart automatically purchase without her knowledge.  This has happened 3 different times over the last few months.  When she discovers the purchase, we have to deal with the awful return process.  Don‚Äôt even think of talking to someone on the phone for Groupon.  Groupon doesn‚Äôt seem to care about this glitch.  This needs to be fixed before we will use the app again."
627,BrittanyLea7,"April 5, 2019",5,‚úå Love this app but they really need to upgrade and make the purchasing more convenient with being able to purchase different styles and not having to pay separate shipping and when purchasing from many different styles you should be able to see the picture of the item or items you are trying to purchase but other then these couple complaints this app the great with great deals!!!

I have also bought deals for my family and friends. The application I downloaded on my iPhone makes it super easy to shop and buy. There are a lot of things that Groupon has made more affordable and I have been made aware of various vendors and businesses that are out there. It's a great way for businesses to advertise and get noticed. :)

And both parents (or whoever is attending) have to fill out spectator waivers.  Free but I didn‚Äôt know ahead of time.  So you can do it online but if not they have a kiosk that was easily accessible.

Sometimes you find such awesome deals that I end up buying more than I should but other times can‚Äôt seem to find what I am looking for.

The details are there if ‚Äúyou look so you don‚Äôt get took‚Äù."
640,Miguel a J,"October 15, 2018",5,"Very customer oriented What I love the most outside of the deals is that this company gets it.  People forget when there are expiration dates on things and that‚Äôs because we all have real lives.  They will send you friendly reminders and if that‚Äôs not enough they‚Äôll extend the purchase for a few more days.  If that‚Äôs not enough, they allow you to trade for another purchase.

You have to be extremely careful about your purchases though especially with beauty items.  I‚Äôve noticed the beauty companies over price the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù amount of an items just to charge you $50 to $100 of what it actually cost so it can look like a MAJOR DEAL, and I‚Äôve had a horrible experience where once they know you‚Äôre a Groupon customers the company tries to short change you smh and Groupon customer service is NO HELP AT ALL.

644,Tree Small,"May 3, 2019",4,"Mostly Satisfied I like Groupon and use it frequently.  The only reason I give it a 4 star instead of 5 is one time we bought Colts preseason tickets through Groupon and when we got there they said someone else was already in those seats and they would not let us in.  My daughter was pregnant at that time and we had to walk a ways to get to the stadium, so I was NOT happy.  I got the run around when I tried to get my money back and never did.

I did a haircut once, a $22 men‚Äôs haircut and shave, I got for $11 50% off Groupon. The guy told me he was getting like $6 cause Groupon takes 40-50%. I was like bro take $10 for a tip."

Groupon is already a good deal but an additional 25% off is a steal. The customer service is top notch also. Had a business that would take Groupon for some reason and Groupon credits me the money back. Just a great experience
649,SunCyndi0407,"June 28, 2019",5,Quite satisfied Groupon over the years has gotten better and better.  I find now most things ship fast as in early years often I assume many came from China as it would take weeks.  Generally the quality has been good although it‚Äôs important to read reviews first .

When we use it, they often send us 20% off codes and thats when we buy our groupon. If I don‚Äôt use it by expiration, I can trade it in on another groupon! This is one of my favorite apps."
651,Becomingjane,"July 19, 2018",5,"My not so secret addiction I love Groupon, I love the fact that it exposes me to local deals & commits me to going to these places, I love their search options, I love their hotel deals & vacation options, I love that I can change my location & find out local deals before I get there & without being inundated with commercials & pop up ads, I love their customer service, I love their deals, I love their accuracy of products listed...I just love it all in all! Fantastic app & great service!"
652,Amazed random citizen,"December 21, 2018",1,"Groupon Stole my Money I purchased a wine tour through 2 with Groupon, and the seller canceled my tour 17 hours in advance, but I was not notified by Groupon or the vendor so I showed up to the pickup location and was never picked up, and I have not received a refund for the $238 I paid. Groupon customer support has not responded (and don‚Äôt try to get ahold of them by phone, they only have an e-mail), and it has been a full 48 hours since my cancelled trip. Groupon also appears to farm out their booking to third parties like TripAdvisor and viator, so have fun navigating the miserable game of ping-pong you will get yourself into trying to get a refund. I am very disappointed and will update my review if Groupon actually addresses this situation."
653,SnowmanAK,"January 29, 2019",5,"Excellent value with money minimum risk. Groupon has given my family a great opportunity to visit places and experience venues we normally would not have experienced.  Using the coupons, gives both the business and customer a great excuse to break out and try new things affordably.  Life is short, let Groupon help you explore and give local companies a chance for you to experience what they have to offer with a fantastic discount."
654,happy9669,"April 3, 2019",5,Groupon Guru I love this app. I‚Äôve used it for years . I buy anything from batteries to photo packages to restaurants. I‚Äôve given it as gifts and received gift cards from family for the sight because they know how much I use it. It‚Äôs easy to search or just browse the sight. I‚Äôve never had any problems redeeming vouchers. I always print them off because tech isn‚Äôt always reliable . Merchants have never had a problem with this. All around great sight.
655,bhadvocate,"March 31, 2020",5,"I love Groupon I have been using Groupon for the past five years. Virtually every meal out of the house, has been on Groupon and I have been able to explore an amazing assortment of restaurants within a 25 mile radius of my home here in Northern New Jersey. I can honestly say that out of probably more than 100 groupons I have never been disappointed. This truly is a great way to try out new restaurants and to Explore eating foods that you might normally have never tried."

We use Groupon all the time when we want to go out to dinner, plan an activity or need something (like a cellphone case).  95% of the time things go great!  When the unlucky 5% happens, I contact Groupon, and they are always great at resolving the problem - even if it costs them money. Best Customer Service since the good old days of Nordstrom and Costco‚Äôs return policies - when you could return anything - even if you didn‚Äôt buy it there."
657,broadminded68,"December 13, 2019",3,"Couple of minor hiccups On the surface the app seems fairly easy to use, but as with all things, read the fine print.  I use the app from my phone.  I had mad two purchases of spa treatments for Xmas gifts before realizing that there is a separate option you have to click to give it as a gift.  The purchases are not transferable so I now get two spa treatments and will buy one more for one of my recipients and have to buy something else for the other...my bad.  If you don‚Äôt scroll down far enough, you won‚Äôt see the gift option.  Just be aware."

My sister got this beautiful bedroom set when she told her she got it on Groupon and what she pain I couldn't believe it. Well, I got the app and I can't put it down I've already started Christmas shopping and have gotten the most amazing deals and gorgeous items you can't find at the stores. I really like Groupon.

Groupon support quickly got back to me and let me know that I could trade-in the voucher and use it for another deal, and if the deal was cheaper I would have an account with Groupon bucks!

Definitely one of my very favorite ways to save $$ !"

What is an invite if it‚Äôs not an email sent to me?? Very frustrating and also that this company has absolutely no way of contacting them . When they began you could still call someone if you have a question. They no longer allow this. What type of business functions without being able to be contacted? They offer email but both my husband and I have done so with absolutely no response. We own two businesses and cannot imagine how long we could continue with this practice of not contactable."

This ranges from vacations to activities with my kids and even eating in a new place for the first time, and what can I say I am a foodie.

So what can I say about Groupon. Their pretty great and they help me save money. What more can I ask for?"

That‚Äôs a bummer! Customer service is extremely important and speaking to a live agent is key! Communication is already difficult at times, and trying to communicate via emails and chats , makes it much worse when trying to resolve issues. I hope you guys find that actually speaking with someone is very valuable, much needed and bring back live telephone agents. "

Even then,  they are quick to promote their Groupon cash back program & want your email & consent to do so instead of actually helping you with an issue. Was told twice by customer support they would assist me with a Groupon that I had already purchased that I was having difficulty redeeming but they did NOT help me with issue & continued to push their program down my throat for enrollment & ended up loosing money on my Groupon."

Had an issue with a service that I purchased a couple of years ago not being as advertised and despite no refunds being listed on the Groupon they gave me a refund in Groupon bucks which was fine with me.

They should be boxed out until people click on the links instead of plastered EVERYWHERE. Barely made it anywhere and already seen like 4 different sex toy items for sale.

Wait 24hours before redeeming so I canceled once I got there and it says refunded but I‚Äôm still waiting ?

695,ronbrew,"July 28, 2018",4,Some good deals but There are some good deals but you have to work at it to find them.

696,crazy all names taken,"April 21, 2020",2,"The reason for three As much as I like a lot of the products, and the variety they have. Customer service is hard to get to first of all, and when you do it‚Äôs a hassle.  When I order something and the item doesn‚Äôt arrive, or wrong item is sent it‚Äôs up to me to Re-package and go take it to the post office.  I spend a lot of money with Groupon yet when I try and get something resolved it‚Äôs like pulling teeth, and they make it feel like it‚Äôs your mistake.  When you spend hundreds of dollars monthly, I understand that some people aren‚Äôt honest, but when it‚Äôs assumed I‚Äôm dishonest really drives me nuts!! Not a fun experience"

I‚Äôve loved all my other coupons are used from Groupon. The only drawback is you have to remember that it‚Äôs there and that it does expire. So you do have to keep an eye on your account. I highly recommend checking Groupon before you buy anything because they‚Äôve always got great stuff out there.
702,app & website dont work,"January 8, 2019",2,"Most frustrating experience I want to provide feedback to Groupon because I have spent 4+ hours trying to make a purchase with Groupon. The reason for this time waste was that Groupon didn‚Äôt allow me to add a form of payment. I attempted to do it through the website and the app. I tried different web browsers and OSs and nothing solved the problem. If you know why the issue exists and how to avoid it, please let me know. A second issue to note as that the app was down when I tried to use it and this happened a dozen+ times. Sometimes it was one all of the tabs, sometimes individual ones."

704,tvkimberly,"January 10, 2019",3,Difficult to use Groupon bucks When I try to pay for something on the app it only gives me the option of using my credit card even though I know I have added Groupon bucks. I had to initiate a chat with an operator and it felt like I was talking to a robot. She told me to go ahead and make the purchase even though it doesn‚Äôt give me the Option to use my gift cards. She told me to go ahead and make the purchase anyway and it would use them automatically. I have no idea if that happened or not but that is a poor system.

Also if you sign up for Rakuten you can get cash back just for using Groupon. I highly recommend both of theses!

I would use the website to buy things but when trying to use my American credit card in different countries, it just doesn‚Äôt work... if I could chose the country on the app, my saved card would get the job done.... Very strange as there used to be a wide variety of countries to choose from :("

Didn‚Äôt lose my money after all, and they always have great deals!"
716,VoicefulEnd,"March 23, 2020",5,Groupon is Great I have have been using Groupon more & more. From restaurants to merchandise. With this recent COVID-19 situation. My trip to Las Vegas/California had to be canceled. No problem getting future credit with Alaska Airlines & Allegiant Airlines. I had purchased a Groupon for a couple nights at the Tropicana in Vegas. I didn‚Äôt bother contacting anyone. As it said no change or refunds. Groupon protected their customers. By issuing a full refund to my Credit Card for my hotel stay. What an awesome surprise that was.

I was told they would definitely do that for me and how sorry they were about my loss. Can't recommend them highly enough!"

724,candygandy,"November 5, 2018",1,"Terrible customer service The support for this service is absolutely terrible. First, it‚Äôs a challenge all on its own to find how to contact customer support. Once you do, don‚Äôt expect them to help you in any way. They will lead you around in circles without actually addressing your concern. Helping customers have a positive experience does not seem to be of interest. The rep I chatted with seemed to have no knowledge of their policies and seemed to go out of his way not to offer assistance. Also, definitely do not buy from any of their third party sellers. There is absolutely no oversight and they will not help you in any way if any of their third party sellers scam you or fail to honor their return policy."

I will always use Groupon.

736,Nicoleeeee11,"January 13, 2020",1,Disappointed New Customer I bought a groupon deal for a home cleaning service for $65 only to later find out the that the specific company I bought it from didn‚Äôt service my area. Me being a new customer and being kind of confused on how to use I I contacted Groupon to get a refund and it was like pulling teeth. Apparently after 3 days you can no longer get your money back and have to find something else to use your voucher on. There were no other services I was interested in if the same value so they did not give me my money back and that‚Äôs $65 down the drain. I don‚Äôt be using this app as a new user that really did it for me. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.

I have had to return all but one good (shipped item) that I have purchased. But the services and experiences are usually a really good deal. Groupon has 25 percent off sales from time to time where you can get an even better price for already discounted services. My recommendation would be to check the reviews on google or yelp before purchasing an experience (restaurant, show, activity, etc) or service."

744,BigEd10,"August 10, 2018",5,Great Online Discount Services; Serving Business Near You Groupon in my opinion has been the App leader for nearby goods and service discounts hands down. The app is configured to have different categories making it easy for the user to find what they want. I love that they use geo metrics to find local goods and services in your region and finding those deals and discounts. I‚Äôm a habitual Groupon user and use it very frequently and I‚Äôm happy using their App and services.

I thought I would be at a loss for the funds but Groupon allowed me to redeem the expired Groupon for any other service within the amount. It was quick and easy to apply the funds to a new Groupon. The process was simple and I didn‚Äôt have to make any phone call, the options were clear and readily available within the Groupon app!"

We have proof from the hotel stating we only used one room and one night, but Groupon still refused to work with us, even though we were contacted them immediately.  We are very disappointed and will not be using the site again.  Groupon is aware  the hotel room was never used, but Groupon was still paid, all we‚Äôre asking is they do the right thing."

And the 2nd negative is that some things can take a WHILE to ship..

So I canceled and tried again this time I caught it takes up to two hours to process. So I canceled the second one and found something for the afternoon. Went through the setup and everything went through but it showed up unavailable. Giving it the benefit of the doubt I waited out the two hours and nothing so I canceled. I‚Äôm gonna hang on to the app hoping this will be resolved in the future so I can use it.

I had to contact customer service who informed me 10 of my items never shipped and they would be happy to give me a refund to my credit card or in Groupon credits. 50% chance of actually receiving items is too high for me to continue shopping on Groupon and the lack of accurate communication of shipment status  was a serious waste of my time and energy."

I wasted over an hour and at least $20 dollars going to the 2 incorrect locations.  I called the Merchant and they told me they don't honor Groupon. I filed a grievance through groupon and was told I would receive a call back within an hour. It's been over 2 hours and I have still not received a callback. I've spent time and money in search of a merchant that purportedly won't even honor my voucher.  The frustration of trying to sort this all out while on my vacation is inexcusable.  I will never use Groupon again.
780,Kamrin Carver,"June 29, 2018",5,Best options! I love that there are so many options available and plenty of response to personalize requests. No matter what mood I am in there is a therapist available to address that need. I‚Äôve always been able to get in exactly when I want and they even bought a heater just for me so I could be comfortable during the experience. Hands-down the most customer friendly experience in the valley :-)
781,Likenangel5,"July 16, 2018",5,"Great savings app I love Groupon app!!! It has saved me a lot of money and pushes me to try new activities with my husband and family. We‚Äôve had a lot of fun trying archery, escape rooms and restaurants. It is very helpful. When you feel like you want to try something new just search using the near your area and you‚Äôll find a lot of great options. It also helps with getting memorable last minute gifts. Highly recommend!!!!"
782,Jinesh A. Kamdar,"July 22, 2018",5,"Love it !! One of the simplest & my favorite shopping app, it‚Äôs clear, uncluttered product listing pages are a bliss to read that just show the right amount of important stuff unlike the tons of stuff on other sites. Everything is shown upfront yet in a very easy to read, predictable & concise manner. There are numerous buyers guides too to help out with the purchase options for a product. Keep up the good stuff with more deals & discounts ;)"
783,WyattErrp,"October 6, 2018",5,"Quality and Quantity! A true gift doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive. I rather give numerous gifts to an individual throughout the year, than one or two gifts, one or two times a year. This also give them more of a selection to wear different jewelry pieces with different outfits at different functions. So, I get both at Groupon, Quality and Quantity. Plus that special person in my life feels that they are special to me! "

785,BarryCF53,"January 20, 2019",5,"Great Ideas!!! I love Groupon because it gives me a lot of ideas at a great price. Most items are spot on with their description. Make sure you read it throughly because that is what you get. There have been very few items that have disappointed me, but when I go back and read their description it turns out it fits the description. I just did not read it before I ordered it. Example..... size."
786,meek123A,"February 21, 2019",1,No very helpful customer service I cheated with a customer service rep that seemed more interested In getting me off the phone that actually helping me with my order. I am very disappointed because I like purchasing things from Groupon but that experience definitely was not a good one. I wanted to exchange an item I received that was damaged and was trying to explain to the rep that that option was not displaying for me. He kept sending info until I just said I will need to return. He then said he sent a return label. Now I will have to return the item and repurchase it. He could have been a lot more helpful with helping me do the exchange bit he/she did not
787,Love134567,"April 9, 2019",5,Awesome I have been using Groupon for many years and con honestly say it‚Äôs always been worth the purchase. Sometimes I find small things here and there not as great on savings but they have so many options to purchase things for less it‚Äôs hardly an issue. I have purchased items over the years and still using them now. Any issues they correct or help you right away. I truly love them.
788,Navbradz71,"April 13, 2019",5,Pro Groupon Outstanding prices on so many things. I feel in spite of their popularity they are still a slightly hidden treasure. I bought some items this year even cheaper then Black Friday sales on other sights and their shipping is fast.
789,Snap4710,"May 2, 2019",5,"Easy to use and easy to exchange I love Groupon and the ability to easily exchange if I don‚Äôt get to use something by the due date. I‚Äôve only had one thing that I wasn‚Äôt impressed with due to quality but otherwise food, experiences and products are great. We started using while traveling so we can explore restaurants and things to do in a location without too much research. Found some great eateries this way!"
790,flcountrygrl,"March 6, 2018",5,Have Always Been Satisfied I've been ordering from Groupon for quite a while now and always been happy with their products. Today I am ordering another table top fan. I have one in my room and the new one is going in my travel trailer to help with the cooling costs. Very great fuel my son told me about Groupon!
791,CapKirk1963,"March 17, 2018",5,Satisfied I‚Äôve been really satisfied with the app. It seems offer the same functionality as the web-based browser experience and yet it‚Äôs less cumbersome. The only thing I would suggest that the developers add is the auto-populate function that the web browser offers. I realize that the decision to not offer such may have already been made and was decided against for security reasons.
792,Pettysprings,"April 14, 2018",5,My experience I use Groupon fairly regularly I enjoyed the opportunity of visiting new establishment and enjoying their service always have my product deliver on time and been happy with all of my purchases. a couple of times I wasn‚Äôt able to use the Groupon  in the allowed time the company that was offering the service always give me credit for the money I spend in my Groupon I will recommend it to anybody.

796,MommyRandie,"November 25, 2019",3,Great Concept but... Groupon offers a conventional conduit for consumers to get great pricing for things we want. My problems with the app are as follows:
797,Christine long island,"October 12, 2019",5,"Groupon Love finding new things to do, when I look on the site. It‚Äôs great when there is an additional 20% or so offer. It allows merchants to build their business as well as helping the consumer. I make sure I‚Äôm Amy service business that I tip accordingly to the original value.

I must say, I have never been disappointed with anything I have purchased. I also love that I am able to trade-in on most of what I buy and don‚Äôt use because as we all know life happens, so it is great that Groupon offers Trade-in. Thanks Groupon you are truly the best."
799,DescentII,"August 7, 2019",5,"Groupon Select is what you‚Äôve been missing. I‚Äôve used Groupon off and on over the years. As a prime subscriber I hate paying for shipping so I usually only bought items that were exceptional values. Now with Groupon Select, I save 25% on local deals, as well as get free shipping on item purchases. If you‚Äôve been hesitant to upgrade to select, don‚Äôt be, it pays for itself each month with only one or two purchases."
800,MD2952,"December 14, 2018",5,My ‚ÄúGo To‚Äù place to try new servicesI I have using Groupon since it first came out.  I‚Äôve always received excellent service and only rarely experienced a hiccup which was resolved.  It is an inexpensive way to check out local services and determine whether I want to use them permanently.  I enjoy perusing through the ads and have bought a LOT of gifts for friends and family through the site!  I am a fan forever!!!
801,RevSylvia,"December 30, 2018",4,"Really good value This is such a cool way to get good deals at the spur of the moment or when you have time to plan. I got the word about GroupOn as a gift and now I use it all the time. Love it! One negative issue I have experienced is with the Mani/Pedi services. They are so popular that I can't get a reservation! The other issue I have is that the merchants they use for the goods they offer aren‚Äôt always vetted well. As a result, sometimes the merchandise is poor. Pay attention to the reviews when buying goods!"
802,Chica416,"February 2, 2019",1,"No customer service Very disappointed! I don‚Äôt know when the change was implemented but in the past there was a customer service number that was promptly answered and any issues resolved with one call. Now there is no direct contact, no phone number to call and all customer support is handled via the app or website. You can tell this service has been outsourced outside the US with robotic replies, push back, and vagueness. Honestly, BE CAREFUL WHEN USING GROUPON BETTER YET AVOID IT. Groupon used to be a great app introducing customers to products and services however they no longer take care of the customers that help grow Groupon. Profits before service. Nice job ruining Groupon."
803,tropicalnole,"February 3, 2019",5,Groupon really rocks! I enjoy this app & service; it lets me sample & save from so many local merchants. I made a mistake & ordered something twice; customer service fixed it within 24 hours. 
804,Rstuff54,"February 8, 2019",3,"Fine print This service is great when you‚Äôre dealing with discounts to a restaurant or a cosmetic care place. For tickets I believe it‚Äôs best to go where only tickets are sold. I thought I bought my wife and a friend tickets (birthday gift) to a comedian‚Äôs show, but it turns out there was a limit quantity to the purchase. I don‚Äôt understand why the app still allowed me to buy two tickets. Which Groupon took my money and just refunded it today (2/8/19). So now I had to buy them at an inflated price, due to so called ‚Äúfees‚Äù. Way to go Groupon App. Cost me some $$."
805,AThalieDms,"February 16, 2019",2,"They need to bring back real customer service I really think that the operators of Groupon are not helpful at all. It's always a problem trying to reach anyone. When I requested a call back noone called or followed up. When I got to trying to do the chat service it was very complex because the operator didn't really want to help me. She didn't even know what my problem was. They need to bring back the phone number where you call and speak to an actual person. I'll be writing to corporate. It makes no sense, if this is a business and you need to resolve an issue and it's not possible. SMH"
806,Goofy-rawks,"February 28, 2019",5,Unable to purchase a groupon Groupon‚Äôs site keeps telling me that my billing record doesn‚Äôt match and it won‚Äôt process my order. I‚Äôve removed my credit cards and added them back in two times yet still not working. The customer support chat line was no help as they kept telling me it was my card and to verify I have money in my account. It is not my card. UGH! Just wasted an hour of my time.
807,Brini#1,"March 20, 2019",5,Satisfaction with services & products I am not a fan of online buying & so am very particular about what services I choose. I really enjoy & trust Groupon. The service has always been efficient & the products 
808,The real Ben Johnson,"March 31, 2019",1,"Some of the deals are a scam I purchased a too good to be true coupon for a windshield discount as my first purchase from Groupon. The website and two phone numbers that were provided for that company were bogus. I politely requested Groupon to correct the issue and they politely told me to figure it out myself. I think I figured it out. Groupon lets scammers sell on their site, and they don‚Äôt stand behind anything going on with their site. I later looked into some other listings that weren‚Äôt deals at all. Coupons for items that are for the exact sales price as the item sells for without a coupon. Check the real price before you buy the Groupon!"
809,Flight of the Conchords10,"April 5, 2019",5,"Best Place to Shop! I purchase a lot of products online, anything from clothing, electronics, health and beauty, food, activities, you name it. I can honestly say this is the best place to shop for so many different items at prices you cannot beat. It can be addictive looking at all the things they have. The quality of their products combined with such inexpensive prices is amazing. I highly recommend Groupon. I guarantee you will love it!"
810,Docjlw,"April 19, 2018",4,"A Qualified Great. Mostly Groupon has been a good place for both goods and services. The products arrive on time and in good condition. Most of the products are as advertised, except the jewelry has much smaller stones than they seem in the pictures. They are described correctly, I think, except I don't have a clue about carat size or a ruler good enough to measure millimeters. It would be helpful to show them on a model, like the clothing. The clothing really is as advertised and everything I've gotten was good quality."
811,Wincub,"August 17, 2018",5,"Buying has never been easier! I decided to buy a massage on Groupon and found completing the transaction easier than ever.  The Groupon app allowed me to scan (with my camera phone) the front of my credit card.  The numbers were faded from use, yet the scan was 100% accurate, saving me from having to key enter those 16 digits.  The rest was smooth sailing too, and now I‚Äôm ready for my massage!  Way to go, Groupon!"
812,Downset182,"October 11, 2018",1,"Force Logout, Server Down, and no support channel While I can appreciate the application updates may log users out, and that login servers go down from time to time, the app has provided a server error for several hours now. With no customer service line to call or chat to text with, users can‚Äôt even report issues or try to get an update on when it will be fixed. I was going to use a Groupon I‚Äôve already purchased for a family dinner this evening, but I can‚Äôt access the app because of this issue. While this is obviously a first world problem, the whole purpose of this app is to create efficiencies and discounts in user‚Äôs lives."
813,Mikal5675309,"April 22, 2020",1,"No accountability hard to get refund Groupon does not make sure vendors give you exactly what you asked for.

The a chiropractor who said they were giving all these different services exam,X-ray, decompression, stimulations, cryo therapy and the only gave me an adjustment. None of the other services. Groupon acknowledge both be giving me a very small refund on Groupon Bucks. I asked them for refund and received none. I have lost faith in buying from Groupon.

I absolutely love the deals advertised but when it comes to purchasing an item to be delivered they have no responsibilities in ACTUALLY getting things delivered to you! They just tell you they can give you a refund and you'd have to reorder items after waiting forever for your missing items. Not professional at all. They do not help track your packages or make any effort. Keep that in mind.

846,Bokira,"September 1, 2019",5,"Exchanges I had a wonderful experience with swapping out a Groupon for a ‚ÄúMani Pedi‚Äù Groupon issue, for both myself and I had purchased the same one for a Birthday Gift for my BFF. I did a live chat to make this exchange, and my chat rep was awesome and helped me a lot!!! The only thing I wish for, is for Groupon to bring back a telephone Customer Service phone number to also be able to quickly speak directly with a rep for such things."
847,Jay Ho P,"August 28, 2019",5,Best user friendly Deal App Nice idea of buying in groups and getting discounts. No need to cut coupons/save cuttings/ search websites / deals page . Save time here and spend it as quality time with family .Very use to use and refund is quick and easy . You always get extra 10-20% very now  and then.
848,Sensei Drew,"August 22, 2019",5,Savings and options This is my first time even looking at Groupon and I saved almost $300 on an item that is normally around $500!!!! 
849,polished_patron,"July 7, 2019",3,Issues with receiving packages I had 3 different packages not delivered and lost out on deals since the time expired and it was not honored. They wouldn‚Äôt send me a new item and they have me half the credit. This has happened 3 out of 30 times. I‚Äôve been using Groupon for 4/5 years now. It makes me uncomfortable with ordering since it‚Äôs such a hassle to get a hold of anyone in the first place. 
850,ShawnaWilliams,"October 26, 2018",5,Groupon I use Groupon all the time from restaurants to massages to Christmas Cards plus many more. I would definitely recommend their offers. They often give discounts on their already discounted prices. They‚Äôve worked with me on a few occasions when business for whatever reason didn‚Äôt honor the Groupon. I‚Äôve been able to trade Groupons or receive Groupon bucks to use toward new offers. I love Groupon!!
851,Deeyasis,"November 5, 2018",4,First time buyer I‚Äôve had the Groupon app for awhile and have really been amazed at what all is on there. My niece is a devoted shopper on Groupon and I‚Äôve been wanting to try y‚Äôall just kept putting it off. Now I know why because I could spend a fortune on here but in the process of moving and have to watch those pennies. And this is where I really need to do my shopping. And I won‚Äôt be in Walmart as much. I really hope I‚Äôll have a long relationship with y‚Äôall. Thanks for the amazing prices.
852,Tri-state traveler,"December 1, 2018",4,"Been using Groupon for years Groupon is one of my absolute favorites! I‚Äôm a single mother and my kids and I have been able to enjoy a bunch of family getaways thanks to the affordable offers thru Groupon. I‚Äôve bought many gifts as well. I wasn‚Äôt too impressed with their jewelry (looks like much better quality in their pictures,) and there were a pair of boots that didn‚Äôt fit but that‚Äôs the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I tell my friends all the time about Groupon!"
853,6fields,"December 6, 2018",3,"Groupons I enjoy most of the offers, the choices and convenience is nice. I sometimes don‚Äôt receive the merchandise and that is frustrating because it is then difficult to reach the company to have it resolved. The quality of customer resolutions really makes me pause in continuing my shopping with this customer. I get wrong items and am told that I have to wait up to 30 days to have the correct one sent."
854,kate apa,"December 20, 2018",5,"Amazing service! Totally works! I was skeptical at 1st but after the 1st appointment it made me realize how much I was missing out!!! It clears your energy,I get so much more relaxed and the stress just went away!! I had hives for a month before that and no medicine was helping but after a couple appointments hives were gone! I am sure they were caused by stress and reiki helped me destress and feel good! I. Ll buy it again and again! Thank you !"
855,Kevsarah,"January 8, 2019",5,"Groupon One of my favorite shopping apps. There are lots of great deals, and practically everything is in stock.  Shipping can sometimes take a little longer than other shopping sites depending on the seller or item, but as long as you keep that in mind when buying it shouldn‚Äôt be too disappointing. I know this is an app review and not a product review, but their Groupon brand batteries are great. Lasts a long time and powerful."
856,RM1971RM,"January 19, 2019",3,"Customer service could be better If you had asked me prior to a couple months ago I would have rated Groupon 5 stars. However, in December they suspended my account for a ‚Äúsecurity issue‚Äù and never informed me. Big hassle getting everything back. I do not like the fact they don‚Äôt have a customer service phone number and everything had to be handled thru email which took longer to get cleared up. I still use Groupon and hope they can regain my confidence moving forward to again rate them 5 stars."
857,Nrod12,"January 19, 2019",5,"Great mainly for restaurant deals!! I have found that for some deals like replacing your phone‚Äôs broken screen or things like that, the discounts are not that great. Some times I have call the places before buying the Groupon and it turned out to be the same price as the Groupon but with less restrictions. "
858,wessid79,"June 20, 2019",5,"Can‚Äôt beat it! I‚Äôm a couponer. When my girlfriend introduced me to Groupon well over a year ago, I was skeptical how it worked. It proved to be so easy and quite a benefit. We use it almost every weekend and have a number of nearby favorite restaurants as a result. We usually save at least 50% a meal. You do get hit with full tax and tip but still saving an appreciable amount on the meal makes it worthwhile. I used to hate eating out. Now I love it."
859,!!CREDIT CARD COMPROMISED!!,"June 19, 2019",3,Customer Service Ended Chat! Customer service rep Nokulunga M. Ended the chat in the middle of assisting with my expired groupons. She seemed agitated that the process was taking too long or the chat sessions was taking too long. She kept Asking is there anything more I can help you with and when I said yes and gave her the information after a while  she disconnected the chat then sends me an email to reply too. I requested  that she have the supervisor call me . Our chat session had not been completed and all of my refunds or credits have not been given.
860,Pickle fun,"March 13, 2018",1,No security I am very disappointed in this app as there is no final security before purchasing. Anyone can use my phone and my app and make purchases with my credit card with out having to put a password or pin into the app. As soon as they click purchase it‚Äôs done. Other apps have security features that required me to put my passport again before a purchase is made or I have to enter a pin. With having two children who use my phone for learning apps they occasionally stray to other apps and knowing they can easily accidentally purchase from this app makes my upset. Until this is fixed my Groupon will be closed!
861,LogicBig,"March 30, 2018",5,Broad local selections I have found a least 5 local companies to try for a single service to see if I like it. It is great for researching new activities. I was also able to purchase my favorite magazines. Purchasing and search is quick and easy. I appreciate the Groupon sales which makes the purchase even more cost effective. I noticed the vendors are allowing repurchasing now which I also like.
862,ChristySingh,"August 3, 2018",5,"Trade-in - Very Satisfied After a 24-hr verification on a merchant that closed Groupon rep Daksna was very quick with assisting me in trading in the two vouchers, one was a gift to hubby and one for myself. Daksna followed up and initiated both trade-ins immediately when I was searching to replace the original purchase. Awesome customer service. This definitely made me change my mind from being dissatisfied to fully satisfied plus the rep processed my requests quickly."
863,mlsouthbay,"August 13, 2018",3,Communication I love to buy from Groupon and I‚Äôve done so for many years. However I am constantly having difficulty logging onto my account I‚Äôve changed my password over the years about 25 times for my Groupon account every time it won‚Äôt let me in I‚Äôm told to make a new password which I do but that new password will not work when I try to sign in I have learned after many hours chatting with your tech people that the only way that I am going to be able to use Groupon is you do it here on my iPhone app.
864,Gokhalevikram,"September 3, 2018",5,Great app and great deals I have been using Groupon for few years now and I am very pleased with deals. Groupon also has this great mobile app that makes buying and redeeming deals quite easy. The deals are competitive and product / service quality is fair for price. I almost do my car oil change through Groupon deal.
865,Sodalicious Stacy,"September 6, 2018",4,"Usually a good deal but be careful A great money saver but be very careful to use them before they expire. No matter what Groupon says, I have had almost no luck using my Groupons after they expire. And sometime have lost all my money if a place goes out of business. If you are careful you can get some great deal especially if you wait until they have special sales but I have been burned so many times it‚Äôs not even funny. I am really disappointed in their business ethic."
866,keldemean,"October 7, 2018",5,Always Check Groupon First! :) If I‚Äôm in the market for something (almost anything!) I do a quick search on Groupon before shopping elsewhere because the deals are really good. 
867,upurasd,"April 4, 2020",4,"üëè has always been great. Only a couple times I‚Äôve been disappointed with products. And I think there should be a better way of contacting when there is a problem with an order. For example, I‚Äôm still trying to get what I ordered in exchange for what I didn‚Äôt. They sent me some crap I don‚Äôt want thinking it would be ok I guess. Well, it‚Äôs not. I have written about 5 times about it and still have not heard anything back : (. This is what they sent me"
868,kkfra,"February 17, 2020",1,Customer service I contacted customer service to try and figure out why I could not rebuy a groupon that clearly stated I re purchase after a year and when it would not allow the purchase I contacted the merchant that told me I could purchase it since it was over a year and to contact Groupon customer service. Once I contacted customer service and explained my dilemma to two different people they could not fix my problem and told me it was a one lifetime purchase only. I contacted the merchant again and was told me they would let me purchase through them since Groupon was wrong. Be careful if you try to fix a mistake made my Groupon.
869,Hydrao,"February 10, 2020",5,"Why don‚Äôt you have this App? Seriously, this place is a gold mine like no other. I can find so much here that it‚Äôs unbelievable. So many of my clothes came from here and so much more than that. If I want, they have it at a more affordable price. I love the fact that I can feel as if I‚Äôm spending lavishly without feeling like I‚Äôm spending too much thanks to the lowered prices. Best of all, I can order all of it from home."
870,itsawow,"April 5, 2019",5,"I‚Äôm a Groupon Groupie! My husband and friends are amazed at the deals I get on Groupon!  There are so many great deals! Most I would be buying anyway, so why pay retail!"
871,jamiejayliejax,"May 4, 2019",4,Love my Groupon orders ! Huge Groupon fan the only thing I wish they would change is the expired groupons because I buy so many that I don‚Äôt alway have the chance to use them or maybe don‚Äôt put such a short expiration date because then I end up not being able to use those and then it‚Äôs a huge bummer when those are wasted üò´other then that amazing deals otherwise I would give 5 stars because I love everything else so far!!!!
872,Mamaleigh24,"May 10, 2019",5,"Love the deals I really love that we are able to read the customer reviews before trying new places. There is such a big variety of deals available in every area, it‚Äôs been a pleasure! I never have any problem using any of my vouchers. It encourages you to try some places that you might not have noticed before. I‚Äôve also purchased seven of the online products and enjoy the free shipping :-)"
873,pickles11.,"January 19, 2020",4,"Could be better with improved exchanges Recently bought a groupon for mini golf while visiting a new city, and then was unable to use the deal.  I lost the money because I didn‚Äôt realize the exchange needed to happen in a short period of time;  I would have been much happier if I could have just opted to keep the credit for later, so it could be applied when there was a deal I wanted. Otherwise, I‚Äôve had a great experience with Groupon deals."
874,2010nanas,"January 6, 2020",5,Glad I Came Back I used Groupon for several items earlier last year. I experienced a few glitches and wasn‚Äôt sure I would ever use Groupon again. I am so very happy to say my glitches were handled quickly and I was treated like a valuable customer! I have since purchased regularly and I‚Äôve been pleased with every purchase I‚Äôve made. Buy with confidence because Groupon stands behind its listings.
875,symone_nurse,"November 15, 2019",5,"Perfect I basically get everything off Groupon!! So many fun activities that I never would have known about, and I did bought my whole family their Christmas presents already from here,"

All my orders keep getting cancelled and every time I call customer Svc it‚Äôs Brenda or Bob or Tim yeah right from India. My problem hasn‚Äôt been solved in over 2 months every time I call it gets escalated and nothing changes when I call back and get angry I get hung up on this company should be ashamed of itself move your American customer service call centers back to America and hire competent people. I just want my money back to my card and want nothing to ever do with this lying scheming company ever again. This company only knows how to steal money and Kick customers down the road Dept to Dept
877,meu1,"August 31, 2019",5,Love this app The Groupon app is my go to app when I want to try new things or when I want to check deals. I‚Äôve tried new activities and new food places because of this app. Sometimes the deals are comparable to other apps but other times Groupon has the best deal. This app is definitely worth downloading if you‚Äôre looking to save some money while trying new restaurants or activities.

I need to return some sheets that I purchased from them because they do not fit my bed. I called the company several times but no one answers the phone so I have been unable to get a return label or an address to return the product to get a refund. It‚Äôs like this company doesn‚Äôt exist!!!  If you have any information on this company please forward it to me.  If not I want to send a complaint to the Better Business Bureau in their city to hopefully prevent this from happening in to someone else.

Upon reviewing your website I noticed that a further discount have been given previously purchased item.

I just had one problem using my Groupon since I didn‚Äôt know I had to go on the items web page & finish my item so I never got it & the money was already taken & charged on my Credit card. Other then that I have really liked it but I do wish we can buy American items more because I hate getting china emails which I can‚Äôt read .
882,Mom 24 Teens,"September 11, 2018",5,"Great for fun locally & on vacay! Groupons hv been a staple for me to provide fun and great dining experiences for my large family. Recently I purchased Groupons for my girls‚Äô weekend getaway to another city. What a great way to take advantage of great deals on entertainment and food and save money! Enjoyed all our vouchers but ran out of time to use one, so I easily just traded the expired vouchers in for credit which applied to a few more deals to use now that I‚Äôm back home!"
883,lyric1,"November 2, 2018",5,"Great app I downloaded Groupon awhile back when ideeli went bust and I thought it was a joke. So about about two months ago I surfing through various categories and thought I‚Äôd make a purchase. Needless to say, I‚Äôm now addicted and this is one of my go to apps. I‚Äôve purchased a variety of things now and have only been unhappy one time with the quality of an item I bought. I cant fault Groupon for that so I‚Äôm a happy Grouponer!"

Groupon please continue the great work that you do!!!!!"

888,Socfan123,"December 28, 2018",1,"Terrible customer service & they offer scams I recently bought a few items from Groupon that were not even close to what was advertised.  First was an item that, once shipped and received, looked nothing like the pictures not fit the specs of the description.  The next was a beats wireless headset.  The item worked for 5 weeks and then the headset failed to charge.  Now it‚Äôs a piece of junk.  During all of this, the groupon customer service was hard to reach and then didn‚Äôt help at all. They simply sent links to their return policies.  "

I did not realize the mistake until after the grace period for switching had already passed.

They could have been hard core about it and stuck it to me but instead they rose to the occasion and treated me well, they are Awesome!"
893,SLclaire,"May 2, 2018",5,Hotel stay purchase Making purchase from Groupon has been nothing but a positive experience. I do purchase restaurants quite often. I just purchased a hotel stay for a week in canada. I had allot of questions I needed answered. I used Live Chat every time and every agent answered all of my question.

Love the changes they‚Äôve made over the years to protect the consumer a little more.

The deals are not consistent so if there‚Äôs something that catches your eye, you should probably go for it. They have frequent sales too.

The reason was ‚Äúaccount closed‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what that means or how to fix it. It makes me feel Leary about buying restaurant gift cards from Groupon again.
913,Luana @ Aliria APA,"July 5, 2018",5,"Excellent customer service I was very disappointed with one of the merchants on here and Groupon allowed me to trade in even after it had expired. Wasn‚Äôt on top of it, and missed the 24 hr trade, emailed them back asking if I could get it again and sure enough they reinstated the trade in again!! So wonderful to get such awesome backup in case things don‚Äôt run smoothly! Thanks Groupon for the great deals you post and awesome customer service!"
914,mare@917,"August 19, 2018",5,"Thanks for everything I have enjoyed using Groupon for a host of different discounts for massages, bedding, little gifts for my family, etc. I love looking for stuff I can enjoy while traveling. I just booked a massage after driving for a couple of days and also saved myself money doing it."
915,WantingtoloveGroupon,"September 4, 2018",1,"Please bring back humans to customer service I give Groupon one star because they have consistently over charged me for purchases, delivered the wrong item (3 times now on the same kitchen mats) and are impossible to get ahold of to fix the problem. I have written emails and done returns and been very specific on the item I wanted to receive. This would all be much simpler if I could speak to a human instead of automation. I‚Äôm a kind customer, easy to please and honestly I‚Äôve never given a bad review to anyone but this is getting ridiculous. I want to love Groupon but the lack of communication and customer service is making it so difficult."
916,P. Sherman Wallobe way,"September 7, 2018",5,Love it!!! I really like Groupon. I have been using it for about 8 months. I have bought items and also booked hotel and water park tickets. It is on of the easiest web sites to make purchases! Also I think the prices are really good. Sometimes it is hard to stick to my budget because I find so many things for fantastic prices. I recommend Groupon to all of my friends and family.
917,Greengail,"September 18, 2018",5,ANAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE I have used Groupon for years. In fact my family does as well. I had two expired unused Groupons. I called customer service and they refunded me half of the purchase total in Groupon bucks or they could also have refunded to another form of payment IE PayPal. Can you ask for better customer service from any major company? 
918,Palmsicle,"November 7, 2018",4,Groupon Review I mostly love Groupon‚Ä¶ And usually do not have any issues with the items they sell or anything else about the company‚Ä¶ But when I have had issues‚Ä¶ A couple of times‚Ä¶ There was no resolution and they would not even make any exceptions to extenuating circumstances.
919,CrochetAunt,"November 22, 2018",5,"Very Happy Everything that I have purchased is in excellent condition when delivered. Only one time, I purchased some smart watches that have never been delivered to me. I don‚Äôt remember redeeming the groupon to order them, but my account said they were delivered. Truthfully, I haven‚Äôt contacted anyone because I am not sure I did everything right. It is an ‚Äúold timers‚Äù thing, I guess.  Otherwise very happy with products and delivery."
920,Beth Torian,"March 6, 2018",5,"Great app for large families As a family of 5 Groupon has allowed our family to take trips, adventures, and try products and services we would normally not be able to afford. We have been able to benefit from this app so many times and we will keep coming to this app first for more amazing trips, adventures, products, and services in the future. Thank you for all the memories Groupon!"
921,Irene TR,"January 27, 2019",4,"Great value (if you don‚Äôt have a problem) I have used Groupon for years, and have always felt it was a good value and experience.  However whenever I‚Äôve had a problem, which is rare, it‚Äôs been difficult to resolve.  I had a groupon that disappeared, and multiple customer people had me repeat the same elementary steps over and over.  It was never resolved, and issue eventually ignored.  Thank goodness I realized I printed it, or else I would‚Äôve lost it."
922,DaveyRoses,"February 14, 2019",5,Good The only option for me to pay was Apple Pay and I had an old card on file so I had to change it. There should be another way to pay like a basket checkout where I put in my card number and verify. There probably is but I couldn‚Äôt figure it out so I went into my settings changed my Apple Pay card and then payed. No Biggie jus think paying should be easier. üòáüëçüèΩ
923,Faris B.,"February 16, 2019",5,"Explore and Save I use mainly use Groupon for restaurants and services. Whether it‚Äôs cash back or vouchers, it works and saves me money. I like to stack cash back by seeing if a certain restaurant is listed on Groupon and other various cash back programs. Sometimes I can get as much as 75% off on food when stacking. Recommend to all unless you have enough money to never care about how much is being spent."
924,marcia clatk,"February 21, 2019",5,"Love Groupons I‚Äôve bought items, gotten groupons for restaurants...we‚Äôve even how to Ireland on a Groupon we had some concerns but they were totally unfounded!

925,Happy Nest,"March 2, 2019",5,Great deals GROUPON is fantastic! Make sure you read the fine print and you will enjoy every purchase.  NOW deals are particularly great and a fun way to try some new restaurants you may ordinarily miss out on.
926,Quaz7829,"April 7, 2019",2,"Groupon isn‚Äôt what it used to be. I‚Äôve been a long time user of Groupon. I even signed up for Groupon plus. Groupon used to have amazing customer service. This isn‚Äôt the first time recently I‚Äôve had an issue, but this is the last straw. A Groupon I purchased turned out to be useless to me because of a delivery issue, and the exorbitant excess charges on top of what I already paid. Groupon customer service used to be really accommodating, and give you Groupon cash with no questions asked. Instead I was told I‚Äôm pretty much stuck with the Groupon unless the vendor won‚Äôt honer it. Thanks Groupon."
927,Tricia94,"May 5, 2019",1,"Worst experience Tried staying at a hotel in college station Texas for Easter weekend, was told by the hotel receptionist that they were unable to find the Groupon and to call so I could figure out why they were unable to find the Groupon. I tried calling and they were closed due to the holidays , I still got charged $99 for the hotel stay even though I was unable to stay due to them not being able to find the Groupon.. all I got back was an email denying me a refund even though the manager at the hotel understood completely but was unable to do anything since Groupon has my card information and not them."
928,RachelEljahLeevonmom,"April 29, 2020",5,Pretty good deals! Groupon has great discounts for many services & establishments that I already patron in my town. I have tried many great restaurants that I normally would not have went to only because I bought or received a groupon. Same with health/beauty services such as massages and even eyebrow micro blading. I always check out the menu for new restaurants and most importantly the reviews left other Groupon shoppers.
929,mletaco,"July 10, 2019",5,Truly here to help Groupon is amazing. They give small local businesses a chance to thrive. I got my iPhone6 fixed for like $30 bucks I‚Äôve gotten storage and cleaning with clutter for like $37 bucks. I hope I never have to change my rating! Also they upgrade you to Groupon select just for being a member for a while. Like what?? I feel taken care of. They care about companies and they care about you.
930,GalwayK,"February 13, 2018",4,"The bargains are great but issue resolution not the greatest. By the time they resolve your issue your purchase is quite often gone. You would think a credit card update would apply to your purchases when requested. Not! You need to re-order everything. Saying all that , the staff are very nice and strive to be helpful. I've had some excellent purchases."
931,Tchase1,"February 17, 2018",5,"Fantastic!!!! Best choice I ever made! I am an Uber Lift driver, and I tell all my clients when the get in my car about my adventures and how I got these amazing deals was on Groupon. And if they have never heard of Groupon then I tell them all about the money they will save. How when they go to a new town they can check before going, and plan their trip using Groupon! I love Groupon!!!! I will never go back to paying full price again!"
932,Ivalutie,"June 14, 2018",5,"Items available and prices on the items are almost too good to be true. I checked the prices advertised on Groupon against the same items on other web sites and almost to a TEE, Groupon‚Äôs prices were lower and in NO case were any prices higher on Groupon.   It‚Äôs definitely a great place to shop and I will return here frequently."
933,Mppederson,"July 9, 2018",5,One Of My Favorite Apps I‚Äôve made over a dozen purchases using Groupon.  The app is very user friendly and the values I‚Äôve received beat any online purchases I've made.  
934,1MJA,"September 1, 2018",5,Hotel Booking First time using Groupon and used it to book a hotel in San Francisco. Prices are cheaper and it was easy to use. I wasn‚Äôt sure what else I had to do so I used the chat option and they were quick to respond. The person said with hotels purchases automatically get sent and confirmed with the hotel. Will use again if no issues arise when I actually check in! ü§ûüèº
935,Save w/groupon,"September 2, 2018",5,"Like it that's for making them available to anyone, not just new customers Love the opportunity to try new places, and revisit some of my old favorites that I haven‚Äôt been to in a while. So many times it is for new customers only, makes me feel like they do not appreciate me enough to offer me a deal from time to time, even if I am a regular customer, thanks for including loyal customers.   HB"
936,litltx,"November 16, 2018",5,Great Site I‚Äôve purchased so many deals from Groupon from restaurant deals to kitchen products to cat toys. Their selection is just awesome. Type in what you‚Äôre searching for and it‚Äôs probably there. 
937,All.Day86,"April 18, 2020",1,Refuse to issue hotel refund Because of the coronavirus I was forced to cancel my trip because of the fort sill graduation and family time was canceled. I canceled before My reservation date  and also had a valid reason. I was not giving my refund and this is unacceptable. This how Groupon treat veterans and other. I am on fixed income and right now I need every time I can to stay afloat. I was to mutilple online chat Representative and I only got the run around. As of today I‚Äôm as told there is nothing can be done and that my money is a lost. I am so disappointed with their customer service and I am not in a possible to throw away $545 any point of my life.
938,mangarjc,"March 29, 2020",5,"Boredom ANNIHILATER I love Groupon! This is my go-to app when I want to do something on a dime and don‚Äôt have any clue where to start. I‚Äôve found so many things for me and my son to do, I feel like there aren‚Äôt enough days in the year to get it all done. Not to mention, the items are a great deal... wish they offered free shipping, though but it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker. As a budget-conscious consumer, this app saves me money and that is the key to my heart. LOVE IT!!!"
939,jessicacatulus,"March 11, 2020",2,"Unfortunate experiences with scams I bought a couples massage that seemed like a great deal, turned out that the number was out of service but rang to a fake answer machine, and the massage place wasn‚Äôt even real. Couldn‚Äôt get a refund so got ‚ÄúGroupon bucks‚Äù back and used that to buy my mom a two hour house cleaning service for Christmas, I even called before buying it to make sure they would come to my area and everything. Now she‚Äôs trying to use her voucher and the number is disabled and email hasn‚Äôt been answered in over a week for the cleaning service. Very frustrating!"
940,KristoferJV,"December 17, 2018",5,"Groupon always has the best deals I've been using Groupon for a couple years now, and they always have the best local deals I've been able to find. I always check Groupon before I have any services done (oil changes, car work, etc), and I've saved a lot of money that way. It's also great being able to save money when eating at restaurants. Highly recommended!"
941,Aurora Wlby,"March 21, 2019",5,"Great Items at Great Prices. I primarily purchase goods.  I get great products at great prices!  If something doesn‚Äôt work correctly or is defective in some other way, it‚Äôs easy to return the item for a refund.  I‚Äôve had experience returning one item.  Everything else has worked great.  I buy a lot of electronic accessories for my Apple products Including buying a number of replacement bands for my Apple Watch."

This day I purchased it, Groupon is offering a site wide discount of maybe another 10% off. Idk I didn‚Äôt do the math. I went ahead and bought the package with a teeth whitening session because it‚Äôs only $88 right now and Jesus has been pushing me hard to go big or go home. Soooooo Go me!"
943,Romae Kimmy,"May 12, 2019",5,Love the App I love using Groupon. I always look here for ideas and great deals. Now it‚Äôs even more awesome Bc they have the Groupon select which saves you even more money AND if you use Ebates or Acorns you earn cash back. It‚Äôs a win win all around. I use Groupon when planning vacations to look up things to do where I‚Äôm going and I pre buy the activities. If you don‚Äôt end up using the Groupon they refund you. Love this app!
944,Mamadog58,"January 20, 2020",5,"Love Groupon!!! I‚Äôve been using Groupon for all sorts of different things for years. I love it because it allows me to try things that I normally would hesitate to try because of the price. Sometimes, I find out they‚Äôre really not my cuppa tea, and then I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt spend full price. But most of the time, things do turn out really well, and then I‚Äôm even more glad that I decided to use the Groupon!"
945,AgapeYogiMama,"December 15, 2019",5,Best deal around As a single mother I cannot express how grateful I am for Groupon.  The deals make it affordable to take my kids to a variety of activities and dining experiences I wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise.  I saved so much money on Christmas and bday gifts.  Truly love and highly recommend this company.  Only downside is if you're in an area where the businesses don't Groupon.  The word needs to be spread!
946,amanda shores,"December 7, 2019",4,Tons to choose from Although groupon has tons to choose from and do have discounted items the extra discount codes are very misleading in my opinion. You receive an email and that same day you try and use it and it won‚Äôt let you. Regardless though the prices are still cheaper than most stores and you don‚Äôt have to deal with crowds. Would definitely recommend. Ive been a returning customer for over 5 years.
947,Stargzr613,"November 22, 2019",5,"Customer Service is Great I‚Äôm very confident when buying from Groupon because whenever I‚Äôve had a problem, which has only happened twice, they have resolved the issue very quickly.  I love when they have their extra percentage off sales.  I‚Äôve gotten great deals on flowers, acupuncture, and car detailing among other things.  The selection of services and merchandise is amazing."
948,Dveshvwn,"September 29, 2019",3,"When it works it really works, when it doesn‚Äôt... I‚Äôve used Groupon a couple of times and it‚Äôs worked and I‚Äôve saved a bunch of money so I thank them.. however when you arrive to a business and the barcode ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt scan‚Äù there is no human phone support available which is not great. There is no way to call ahead and validate your voucher will work without redeeming it. Needs work. If you‚Äôre going to remove human assistance, then empower the customers with more tools to solve their problems."
949,cvegas72597,"July 20, 2019",5,"Good deals You have to really read the restrictions in the fine print or you‚Äôll be shocked when you get there, and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask what‚Äôs included prior to ordering or you‚Äôll get surprised again when the bill comes.

So I‚Äôve been using this app for a while now, hadn‚Äôt had a problem until I purchased a deal for Moe‚Äôs famous charbroiled burgers, the place is disgusting, unclean, it‚Äôs ran in a liquor store with unsavory characters all the way around. The kicker was the drunkard that keyed my car because my dog was inside. When I contacted Groupon about this they suggested I give it to a friend or family member to use because the coupon was final sale. So basically ‚Äúsorry you were attacked outside an establishment WE recommended, why don‚Äôt you send someone you love or care about there? ‚Äú Needles to say just waiting for the last of my items to arrive so I can uninstall."
951,SharreeDM,"June 21, 2018",5,Ear Buds I‚Äôm new to Groupon so I don‚Äôt know how it works. I wanted to buy a set of earbuds for my husband through Groupon was afraid I would have to jump through hoops. I simply touched create an account he wanted my information such as my address and credit card number and I made my purchase. It was all so simple oh very friendly to use. I recommend anyone to just simply go on buy something and you‚Äôre done.
952,HappyBuyet,"June 22, 2018",5,Another great deal on a quality product! I bought a ring for my daughter that was supposed to have been a very high price that was reduced extremely. After buying some other jewelry from a Groupon I have been very pleased with the quality and the price so I decided to buy this ring for my daughter as well. It was an absolutely beautiful ring and you can‚Äôt beat it for the money.
953,Sheba38,"July 24, 2018",1,"Very Disappointed I heard so much positive of Groupon that‚Äôs why I joined just to have the negative happen to me. I placed an order with them on July 22,2018 and on July 23, 2018 I received a call from my credit card security and fraud unit that someone from Groupon is trying to place several orders using my credit card. I try emailing them and calling them with negative results. How can this happen? What type of staff does Groupon hire to work for them. This is unacceptable. Can Groupon please investigate and get back to me. I am so disappointed with this company it‚Äôs not funny. If I knew this is what Groupon was all about I would never had join. What a disappointment."
954,mother ducky,"August 3, 2018",5,Fun Groupon is getting easier to use! It was a bit difficult in the beginning...I love all the local deals that they have in my town...

I have shared this site with everyone I come across. Thank you for being so easy!
955,givup2018,"September 8, 2018",5,"Always check Groupon before buying anything I have been using Groupon for a few years. The prices for whatever I‚Äôm looking to buy are much cheaper on Groupon.

Just took a Bahama Cruise that I purchased on here. Customer Service is outstanding. Try it you will not regret it."

960,Ollybl,"February 11, 2018",4,Getting old I‚Äôm using Groupon mobile app for a long time now. I am getting pretty disappointed with the way the algorithm works. The selection of products has been narrowing down and it is hard to get the app to display a variety.  I like to shop all categories with no particular item in mind and getting bored by the same items week after week. Hope this gets fixed soon as I really like the app and the service.
961,JColetta1,"March 18, 2018",4,"Awesome app for some things, not so much for others Sometimes the deals are fantastic, other times you can get the same price on Amazo, etc. so it‚Äôs not really a ‚ÄúGroupon‚Äù just listing the price as discounted, which is a bit misleading.

969,ShopperOne,"October 8, 2019",3,‚ÄúDeals‚Äù aren‚Äôt deals at all... Some ‚ÄúDeals‚Äù aren‚Äôt deals at all... if you go to the website. They either charge the same or lift the price to give a ‚Äúperceived discount‚Äù or. They‚Äôre just to costly in the first place... there‚Äôs really no deal. Groupon should require at least a 20% discount on services and products. After all we clients/patrons have gratuity automatically added to our bill... only seems fair since patrons are required to pay a tip... the seller should also be required to give an actual discount.

971,Jenyfermykol,"March 27, 2019",1,Do not use Since they changed the format you only get a percentage back instead of a coupon for a good deal so you have to pay in full and then hope they give you back your ‚Äúcash back‚Äù which they don‚Äôt. Then you have to try to get through customer service which I believe is trained to be as little help as possible why making you look up information that will kick you out of chat and make you start all over. End of the day I never got my cash back. Went to a restaurant I would never have gone to otherwise and lost about an hour of time trying to fix the issue. NOT WORTH IT

I checked a few times a it said pending July second ,I happen to check to make sure the place to go and make sure of the address. that‚Äôs when I find out that order failed, checked my email and no notification that they had any they had any trouble to complete the order. That makes me really upset ,now I had to book another hotel more expensive and on top a $35 daily fee on top with no breakfast, the other hotel included breakfast. I am a loyal customer and I think they should honor the original hotel."
980,Redhead1943,"May 30, 2018",3,"No easy Especially for first, second, & third time users Groupon is awful. They make finding how to return stuff hard. Also if you switch between your iPhone and laptop, which you have to do for a return, you have to change passwords EACH time. I also ordered but received the wrong product returned it but never received the correct one. I finally reordered the same one again we‚Äôll see what happens. Overall it‚Äôs still a 3 Star. If you don‚Äôt pay attention you lose."

The favoriting option comes & goes which is the only way to keep track of things you are interested in unless you want to send yourself loads of emails. There is not NEARLY enough information on purchases or options if there are problems on the app. Really annoying Groupon."

I wanted to delete my account because I never used it and I kept getting emails that I found annoying, at first I tried to just unsubscribe from the emails, it said it would take up to 72 hours. That was fine however over a week later I was still getting 3 emails a day. So I decided that I was going to delete my account. First off, I should be able to delete my account whenever I want to not have to fight with customer service about it. Second off, they still haven‚Äôt gotten around to deleting my account. If you actually use it I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great if not it‚Äôs just a hassle."

988,Thriftmomma,"December 22, 2018",4,"Very good, but could use slight improvements I like the ease of the app, but it could be improved. You should be able to have a cart to shop for items, so you can buy multiple items at once. Also, there needs to be a more consistent way to mark items as favorites. Although the button is there, you can‚Äôt always access it (maybe due to different kinds of devices??). Overall, easy to use."

I have saved thousands of dollars over the years for doing things I would've done without this app thanks for the great service
993,Bowtie0716,"June 9, 2019",5,"Groupon I have purchased several things off of Groupon and never had a problem with any of them. If the Groupon had expired prior to the time I had a chance to use it, the companies have been very good and let me use the face value (face value of being white I paid Groupon for the certificate)in their store or place of business.  This usually is printed on the coupon as well."
994,sreets,"April 27, 2020",3,"Retrieving vouchers I found this quite difficult.  They even have a video to show customers how to fo it, which shows I'm not the only one who found this hard.  While trying to get my voucher #, I managed to hit the ""already used this voucher"" button (not exact wording).  I couldn't reach anyone at Groupon for help because even their customer service is closed during the pandemic.  So, to receive the deal, I chose to buy it again.  Fortunately at twice the cost it was still a decent deal."

998,RoRo_RoRo,"September 2, 2019",5,Love Groupon but check the fine print Groupon is great but always check before buying. Third parties have cancelation policies in place and many do not allow for cancellations even a few minutes after booking.  Overall Groupon can not be blamed for that. I save a tremendous amount of dollars. Always looking for dead to maintain my budget. The more I save the more I invest into other things.
999,Credos9,"September 1, 2019",4,"Surprised I have been using Groupon consistently for the past 4 months and have been pleased with the services offered. I had a couple of problems in the beginning with the app and my account, but received fair customer service and my problems were resolved. Overall great way to get local deals , but hope the company continues to improve their customer service resolution center. Not quite 100% quality"

1001,stylintn,"December 3, 2018",5,Very Convenient! I‚Äôve always been happy with everything that I bought. A few times there were hiccups along the way but they were straightened out with no problem. The prices are worth coming back because I know they will stand behind what they sell. I also know what I purchase is going to make me happy that I made that decision to keep coming back again.
1002,MF7642,"January 13, 2019",1,"Poor Quality merchandise Ordered some items for Christmas. Very poor quality.  Clothes ripped, merchandise was damaged upon opening. I ordered a white elephant gift that took weeks to arrive. Couldn‚Äôt return any of it.  In the fine print, the white elephant gift missed the return window before it even arrived. Very shady companies with Groupon. Groupon no better. There is no way to contact them. I found them on the Internet but the system was so overloaded it was going to be hours to get a hold of anyone, if I wanted to wait on the phone. Avoid any actual merchandise, Gift certificates are OK. I wouldn‚Äôt do any other kind of dealings with Groupon. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1003,Ekcupp61,"March 10, 2019",1,"Ease of service I have tried at least 15 times to order the Sam‚Äôs club membership. It continuously was kicking back my credit card. Not for lack of funds it just simply kept kicking back, try again later , I kept it going and try again later. Groupon insisted that it was that one my end. I even used to as the credit cards and it still kept kicking it back saying to try again later. They kept saying try it now it‚Äôs sure to go through now. Nope it did not go through. I ask as a courtesy for my inconvenience for $20 of free credit to my account. They said no. So in my opinion they sucked."

1005,cnenbshc,"April 13, 2019",5,Groupon is great but... This app finds get deals for places and events we have never tried. My only con was Groupon found an offer to fix my car. I drove and drove off my ‚Äòfix‚Äô car only to realize there were missing lug nuts for two tires. The next day the mechanic was claiming everything was in order when he was done. I reported the situation to Groupon they gave me a full refund of the deal.
1006,Miko rounds,"April 26, 2019",4,"Great app. For the customers Great app, however I believe they should should be better at informing businesses when they offer extra deals because they take 50% of what we pay. I believe this causes merchants to be not as pleasant with the customers. The app is amazing for finding activities in your community and for finding good deals. Things you may have never tried or thought of doing instantly become accessible."
1007,the shopiholic,"May 18, 2019",5,"A happy customer I managed to do a considerable amount of my Christmas shopping through Groupon. I must say that the vast majority of items did not disappoint. The merchandise is of good to excellent quality. The items that are offered, in many cases, are a little different which makes it fun to purchase them. The only thing I would say is be careful when you order your sizing and consult the sizing charts."

I‚Äôm a very impatient person and always looking for deals on a budget and Groupon always comes through. Always having multiple vendors so you have a choice of the same type of product with differences that meet your particular need.
1010,Awesome1966,"May 12, 2018",5,"My View The savings Groupon offers are great, I also like that a business‚Äô name can be entered and Groupon will instantly reveal whether or not a Groupon is available for purchase. If the vendors were more informed on the details of the Groupon being used, this would make the redeeming process much more easier for the user. I don‚Äôt use Groupon enough to be very good with the redeeming process to not require vendor assistance."
1011,ReneeLannaman1,"June 2, 2018",4,"Good Deals I‚Äôve grown to like Groupon a lot. It took some getting use to because I‚Äôm a skeptic for when it‚Äôs too good to be true, it usually is a catch...not in your favor! But I must confess Groupon and their vendors have proven this statement not true in their case. Enjoyed many Groupon deals as true deals without the bait and switch.  I recommend it, especially when you‚Äôd like to be active without the exorbitant cost of entertainment for self, children and grandchildren alike."
1012,Lilieth C,"June 10, 2018",5,Great Price.... Easy to Use We have used Groupon for several years and have saved a lot of money on things we love to do.

I‚Äôve found items that were $50 more then I found them in store.  But I‚Äôve got some really good deals on here and it‚Äôs great to get stuff for your new home.

So when we do happen to have the same off days we like to do something nice with the boys.

There was a situation once where the provider canceled our Groupon due to inclement weather, and then wouldn‚Äôt refund us or give an open-date voucher since we were on vacation visiting, and we weren‚Äôt able to get credit or anything from Groupon, but other than that one experience, worthy of 4-stars."

I‚Äôve used their services to travel to Pigeon Forge, TN and experienced a hurricane in the Bahamas with world class customer service. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 our vacation has been cancelled. Groupon is not receiving calls to customer support, chat and online only. I‚Äôve spoken to 4 associates all say they will pass my request along to another department. I‚Äôve tried contacting Groupon for weeks to no avail. Worst experience I have had by far and this was one of our most expensive trips I have planned and with the unexpected circumstances I am appalled by their level of poor customer service."

After I made the purchase I realized it said it had to be redeemed within a week. Ok, not the end of the world, I would just have to get ahold of my brother and tell him he has to go soon. I still decided to see if there was a chance I could get a refund. Upon investigating that I learned the the tickets could only be used after a certain date, this date just so happened to be the day they expire.

It‚Äôs a turn off because it doesn‚Äôt allow for window shopping, add to the cart, and then make a final decision after you done your shopping.

I‚Äôm trying to confirm a hotel reservation and I‚Äôm told it will take up to 48hrs for my problem to be resolved?? My entire trip depends on the hotel... the hotel has no record of a reservation for me and now I‚Äôm supposed to wait 48hrs to confirm a hotel reservation that I‚Äôve already paid for?? Very poor.

Took me forever to figure out how to get ahold of customer service to resolve the issue. When I did, they had someone who barely spoke English and did not understand what I was saying. Instead of shipping me the missing item, they had to credit my account so I could reorder the item myself. When I reordered the item, I have to pay shipping AGAIN? That‚Äôs completely comical. I placed the order again because I want the recliner covers, but I doubt I‚Äôll be using this app again."

Costumer service (Marek S), has been useless and claims I didn‚Äôt activate the deal until after I left which is simply not true.  I believe what happened is the bartender initialized the card to start the tab and from Groupon‚Äôs POV, the transaction was completed even though it was just beginning! I‚Äôm owed 30%, the deal even saw subsequent transactions receive 10% back, I was given <2%.  Complete garbage, so disappointed."

My advise is have a strict dollar amount that you will spend BEFORE you start shopping. Also, look closely when buying ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù like shows, spas, home services. Look at reviews and terms before buying a hiking trip for 2 used only on Monday night. But overall it‚Äôs a fun shopping spree. Try not to go crazy!!!"
1070,Masterplannerk,"June 21, 2018",2,Groupon Review I found a good deal but I didn‚Äôt like using the Apple Pay feature.  The credit card is needed anyway so what‚Äôs the point of Apple Pay being the only option? Apple Pay‚Äôs thumb print feature was slow and took me several tries; overall it was extraneous and time consuming.  I also think that it is uncomfortable to be required to use my fingerprint to pay for something.  All that information should not be necessary for an online app. That is something I don‚Äôt want to do in the future if I continue to use Groupon.

When I contacted the place they told me it would be an additional $50 per Groupon. So I would be spending $200 total for both vouchers. When I contacted Groupon twice to speak about this the persons ( they didn't even tell me there names ) who helped me both said it was the sales tax. I didn't know the sales tax was the same amount as  the subtotal. This is just ridiculous if I wanted to pay double of what I was getting I would have just gone directly to them .

1111,Pam Drake,"August 4, 2018",4,"I Love The Deals, But Accessibility To Screen Reading Software Is Declining I have am totally blind. I have been using Groupon for many years. Unfortunately, the decline in accessibility to screen readers for the blind and the unavailability of phone support is making the service much harder to use. I will still keep my subscription but hope the time does not come when I am unable to shop here. For the above reasons I cannot give Groupon a five star rating."
1112,Hacked Groupon Account,"August 16, 2018",2,"Customer Service needs improvement While I have enjoyed great deals on Groupon, their customer service has a long way to go. I purchased a Smog Time smog check deal 6 days ago, planning to use it today. Today, logged into the app, only to find it has already been redeemed 2 days ago. I contacted customer service but have to wait 48 hours for a response. And then I noticed two more deals added on as ‚Äúpending‚Äù status and began to realize my account was likely hacked. Sadly, Groupon is nowhere to be found when you need help right away."

I did the same thing and they denied refunding me the additional charge. Their costumer support just wasting your time. Their facebook sevice is joke.

The process of choosing photos was daunting because I have so many of my Furbabies and it‚Äôs hard to narrow it down to 13 but it came out great and I can‚Äôt wait to start using it in my office at work. I just ordered two more for friends for Christmas.
1182,Gandyson,"September 28, 2019",5,"Great buys every time When you want to try something new, Groupon is a great place to start. Look around and you can find that restaurant you have been wanting to try and then you can save a few bucks. Going somewhere and need to park your car by the airport, check Groupon and save some money. In fact you can save on almost anything and it‚Äôs easy."
1183,LANI@111,"September 1, 2019",1,Not happy Groupon is to expensive for a lot of items can find @ better price in stores! The process of purchasing a groupons is very shady lately I purchase some items that did not show up on my groupon so I order double items had a hard time to cancel the extra one then they say you have 3 days to cancel orders but after one day the cancel option do not show up on your groupon so you have to go through writing a email cause it's impossible to get through customer service the last time I contacted custermer service it took three weeks to resolve the issue
1184,shanon3,"August 31, 2019",5,"Love the deals Live on fixed income and the deals I find on here for all holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries, is always worth the time to set here and scroll through the products.

1185,Idhitit,"August 29, 2019",5,"Love it I find Groupon very easy to use. I have no problems with any of the vouchers. I have found that some things are not the great deal as they are made out to be. If check out an item you are not sure that it‚Äôs a great deal, check around, you might be right but very well could be wrong. Check shipping cost on every deal you are interested in."
1186,Fr3nChii,"July 16, 2019",2,Extended Pending Time I was out of town and purchased a Groupon that I needed to use for the following day. When it was pending for three hours I contacted customer support who told me to wait longer because they couldn‚Äôt expedite the process. At over 6 hours of pending  I contacted them again and it was the same story. I usually never have an issue with Groupon but this caused me to be unable to  do the activity that I had planned because the following day is the only time I had to do it. It didn‚Äôt help that customer support just told me wait.

It was difficult enough to try to figure out how to get the situation fixed because every time I clicked on the ‚Äúget help with this order‚Äù link the app crashed. When I was finally able to get to a screen that I could work with, Groupon said the exchange email would be sent to me immediately. A day later I have yet to receive one. I am very disappointed with their ability to handle problems with orders."

I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but I had to from my terrible experience with Groupon+ I claimed a cash back deal at a restaurant for 30 percent and spent over 100 dollars on dinner because I thought I was going to get 30 percent back. But almost 3 months later I haven‚Äôt received my cash back. I‚Äôve sent over 10 emails reporting my missing cash back and all I get are auto generated responses. When I did get somebody to chat with they literally couldn‚Äôt tell me anything about why I haven‚Äôt received my cash back and they ended my conversation randomly without even saying anything.

No false advertising here.... just be a wise consumer and read The Fine Print, as with anything else.   What you buy is what you get.  I have never had trouble redeeming any of my restaurant deals.

1198,Little tolerance,"January 8, 2019",4,Always Something New I love Groupon because it gets me to try new restaurants and activities. There customer service has been helpful when needed. My only complaint is that sometimes you don't get all the info you need till after you buy it. But now I know to go on the website of whatever I am purchasing and read all info first. I have even used Groupon when I have traveled to other cities.
1199,halvogirlk,"February 23, 2019",5,"Because of Groupon I have done and tried more things than I would have otherwise!

Yes my wife and I have saved money by using Groupon, and in the process found places to eat and visit that we never knew were here in the Atlanta area around us. Groupon has made our move here from Huntsville easier to find the services we needed, instead of driving around looking and asking people if they knew where what we needed was located."
1201,SlydesQueenB,"June 2, 2018",5,5 Stars from me! I Love Groupon!! You find some really cool stuff on here. Bedding alone in stores are extremely expensive with the amount you spend at Target for a comforter and sheets you could get a full bedroom set on here. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve had some bad transactions but like any store you could return. So my suggestion is to read reviews and check to see if the except returns. Research Research Research!!!
1202,ms burg,"June 5, 2018",5,"Groupon love Love, love, love, and did I mention love. Great deals and discounted try before committing to a product or place.

Family expressed an interest for a boat ride on the Detroit River. It was pricey but we found the Groupon for the ride. My co-chair and myself bought as many Groupons as we could between us. The owner was so impressed that we bought all the Groupons that he let all the kids ride for free! 
1205,lovemusiq23,"August 3, 2018",5,Rate this site I‚Äôve been using your site for a long time product is good the only thing is my fall back is your return policy you need to improve more efficient and fast process  and smoothing is the tax you should be able to other one time if you have a lot of stuff to order. otherwise everything is good keep it up the good work

That representative said they can re-order the items or give me ‚ÄúGroupon bucks‚Äù, so i am basically forced to just use my money I wanted back on only Groupon. I told him to replace the order and today is April 29th and again no information or a refund is available. I gad to just ask for my Groupon Bucks and forcefully spend my money on Groupon again. Groupon will thief your money and force you to buy from them only."

However, the customer service is lacking. The fact that you can‚Äôt call and speak to someone is frustrating and while chatting there is at times lost in translation. Some of the interactions I‚Äôve had with the agents have been stand-offish. Despite that good deals so far."

Anytime I know I‚Äôm going somewhere out of town I always check to see what I can get off of here before I go.

Groupon helps come up with things to do with nephews and grandchildren. All I do is see what‚Äôs on sale for that day, order, and go. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to see if Groupon can save you money on an already known destination. I love being introduced to local vendors (I would never have found without Groupon)!"
1216,Rey user,"October 31, 2019",5,Great Investment Loooooove Groupon and all the deals it has to offer. Found out about this through the Ellen show and I didn‚Äôt think she was being serious at first but I‚Äôm sure glad she was. Being able to save not just on things but great local and non local experiences is amazing. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.
1217,Dreamer_281,"August 17, 2019",5,"Groupon app is very convinient I like the Groupon app! It's nice that you can just pull your purchased groupons up on the app and it'll even tell you which of your groupons are you near! I just wish it would show the northern VA deal of the day. Maybe there is a way to view it but I can't seem to find out how. Other than that, I love it! I love the sales too!! Gets you an even bigger discount!"

1219,Cherry-lyn,"June 14, 2019",3,Good but some issues regarding lack of customer service I like Groupon but don‚Äôt like the fact it is so hard to contact someone in customer service when you have a problem! I still haven‚Äôt received a purchase that was suppose to be delivered in March & also some earrings I ordered were suppose to come in gold & silver but they sent two pair of gold.

1222,AllieG3,"November 19, 2018",1,"Had to delete the app After years of using Groupon, off and on, I‚Äôve had more and more terrible experiences. I will say, customer service is still pretty good, they always refund my orders. However, my complaint is that the deals on Groupon are not accurate. There is a consistent issue where details on service locations, hours of operations, etc are no not included. I then am not able to use the Groupon due to these missing facts. Its terrible and giving the poor vendors a bad name too. I will no longer be using this company, as the headache it causes is not worth the few dollars saved."
1223,NayNurs,"November 27, 2018",5,Always Great Never have a problem redeeming any Groupons and we are always looking for more options of new places to try.

Majority of the reviews that are posted on the merchants have comes from Groupon themselves, not actually patriots, as well as they tend to mark up prices to make it seem like you‚Äôre getting a really get deal. I tend to go on a merchants‚Äô website and compare both prices from Groupon and the merchants‚Äô."

Additionally, if other companies can offer free shipping, why can‚Äôt Groupon figure that out??? Most of the prices are competitive, but not better than other companies."

I called the merchant providing the services and HE WASN‚ÄôT in the mood of helping AT ALL.

The only downfall is the crazy shipping you get charged and the long ship times.  Especially if you have to go to someone else‚Äôs website to finalize what you need. I paid $20 in shipping for a $4 blanket. If they would do free, quicker shipping, they would have most of my business and 5 stars."

Groupon is great to use for when you want to experience local businesses. I have used Groupon for trips and found cheap fun things to do in the visiting town I traveled to.

I contacted them and in order to recoup the money I spent on the groupons that I no longer have access to, they expect me to give the details of the purchases like the promo numbers, date purchased, and more details that I can only get IF I COULD GET INTO MY ACCOUNT. So just beware you may lose everything if GROUPON decides to deactivate your account through no fault of yours!!!"

I once booked a hotel room advertised as a deal on Groupon for the same amount as the ‚Äúspecial rate‚Äù that Groupon offered.

You can find just about anything on this site and the ‚Äúdeal of the day‚Äù is a fun way to try new things at a discounted price. I‚Äôve been using Groupon for five years and have only encountered one problem with a nail salon. They acted like I was an intruder because I had a Groupon. They shouldn‚Äôt use it to market ‚Äîif they aren‚Äôt going to treat customers w/respect. This was not Groupon‚Äôs fault.

Some restaurants have even gone out of business and I‚Äôve had to get credit.   Some things are decent and others a huge disappointment.   Beware of the ‚Äúbeautification‚Äù spas and boutiques.

Usually I don‚Äôt have an issue but the time that I do it would be nice if Groupon made their mistake right and fixed this problem but they won‚Äôt.

I was recently double billed for $125 and have spent 2 days trying to contact customer support by phone, email and text to no avail. As of today I am deleting my app and will warn others not to ever use it. Groupon has apparently become a scam."

I even got reminders from Groupon to use it before it expired.  When I tried to contact Customer Service at least 6 times the site was down and I cannot get help to get a refund on the Behive so I can buy another Groupon.  :( need help!!  Now I cannot sent the review because the nickname is taken. :( :(

So when I tried to edit the order in the ‚Äú2 hours‚Äù window, the system said I was not able to change it with the excuse I used Apple Pay. I then called but the customer service line tells you to go online or use the app for frequent questions, there is not even an option to speak to operator. So I had to end up canceling the transaction and replacing the order. Now I have to wait 10 business days for them to refund my $50. Trash!"

The only issue I have concerns shipping because my items are always deemed undeliverable because of a defect in the way my shipping address is transcribed. Really weird because this only happens with FedEx Smartpost. If Groupon used another carrier for smaller items to ship, it may help."

However, if you are not happy with merchandise you that you ordered, it is almost impossible to find out how to return it or get a refund. Read the fine print carefully about return policies before you click on ‚Äúbuy‚Äù-my advice. Also beauty treatment groupons-some of the providers treat you as second class if you bought a Groupon, just sayin‚Äô"

1338,allparis,"April 2, 2020",4,"Great deals! I love deals from Groupon! I buy them often! My only dislike is they won‚Äôt work with you in emergency/unexpected situations.  Meaning, I bought one for a Spartan race months in advance, 3 days before the race I ended up driving my daughter to an unexpected medical appointment in another state so I wasn‚Äôt able to race. Groupon doesn‚Äôt have a policy in place to help in these cases that I could show proof for. But, other than that I LOVE it!"

1340,Always A Detroit Girl,"December 16, 2019",4,Review I enjoyed the businesses that Groupon has contracted. I think they have a lot to offer. For the most part I've had an excellent experience with them. There has been one that I've been very unhappy with. I did not get resolution with Groupon customer service. Groupon needs to hire more people to work with them to take care of business. They need to remember that the customer is always number one.
1341,gbpsf,"December 4, 2019",5,"Loyal Groupon is very loyal to its customers. Several times, I have absent-mindedly let Groupons expire, and the company has given me a second chance to use them. That is above and beyond what it is required to do. And Groupon Select is totally worth the upgrade. I neutralized my yearly subscription in one travel purchase. The rest of the year is just gravy and  plenty of it. Thank you Groupon!"
1342,AS1197,"November 12, 2019",1,"Trash Groupons lack of customer service renders it as an absolutely trash service. App has live chat feature which doesn‚Äôt have people responding most of the time, and when they do they‚Äôre of no help. Links send you to troubleshooting pages with limited selection of issues, usually not addressing the issue occurring. Customer service is slow, if even present. You can‚Äôt even get on the phone with someone at Groupon if you try to. With a service this big you‚Äôd expect them to have some employees doing troubleshooting and customer service over the phone, but nope."
1343,lOv3_jOn3Z,"November 9, 2019",5,Great deals and discounts Groupon already has a lot of great deals you can‚Äôt find on the vendor‚Äôs website but my favorite time to purchase is when they have discounts on top of the Groupon savings price. I always end up feeling like I got a really great deal. I just wish they‚Äôd continue to offer the additional savings on hotel stays as well.
1344,Getting Bites,"November 6, 2019",5,"An Error Redeemed When I was unable to locate the Groupon I purchased I was very distraught, as I had to pay full price for 4 tickets in addition to the Groupon.  Luckily, I called Customer Service a few days later and was taken care of by Justin, a very understanding and patient employee.  He arranged for me to trade the Groupon for other services that I could use.  I was quite relieved!"
1345,GREENMTNBOYA,"October 20, 2019",5,"GROUPON provides unmatched Deals! We have found Groupon in general to be very helpful in finding good deals on concerts we might never have attended, to Segway Tours we likely would never have taken, to Photobooks (although not produced in the USA) that we could give to our traveling friends, to the occasional gift or garment item, that were more affordable than other places."
1346,veil_of_illusion,"October 4, 2019",1,Groupon vouchers unavailable All of a sudden a number of vouchers I purchased were unavailable for use or the value had been reduced to what I paid and this is unusual because they had not expired. I was either not able to contact customer service or get a satisfactory resolution for the one time I was able to do a chat. Being told I could trade for Groupon bucks is not acceptable because I purchased under certain conditions and intended to use and the terms changed without my knowledge and consent. I should be allowed a refund. The quality and service has gone done tremendously.
1347,ecret lady,"September 29, 2019",4,Way to go... Groupon offers a HUGE variety of products. We have been pleased with the speed of delivery. We‚Äôve been pleased with the quality of the products.

I also found many companies that I go to now after using my Groupon because their service was great.
1349,madgrenade,"September 16, 2019",5,"I love groupon Most of the time I have a craving to go through websites searching for events, deals on clothing and overall anything that I might need and Groupon makes it extremely easy to find fun things to do or find a deal on something I was looking to buy at a way larger price.

When my orders are for products I have always received them in a timely manner and found the products to be highly satisfactory.

1362,The1knothead,"October 22, 2018",1,"Never help. Not about the customer. You can find good deals, that‚Äôs for sure, but, it‚Äôs sad that when you run into some trouble, they‚Äôre never there to help. They just keep the money. No customer service number provided. Not even a freaking option. The only thing you can do, it‚Äôs email them, which by the way, I‚Äôve been waiting for an answer since March 17th. Today is April 23rd. Or chat with incompetent, ‚Äúcustomer service agents‚Äù that are rude and end the chat with no notice at all. If I could give this scam of an app a negative score, I would. Not worth the trouble dealing with these scammers."

For example, trading in a voucher and what was explained to me did not occur which resulted in a 2nd attempt.  Only to be told something totally different.

Only thing I don‚Äôt like you have to read ALL the fine print. There‚Äôs a lot more restrictions on some Groupon than others. So if you‚Äôre drawn in by the caption make sure you read the terms and conditions briefly described in the Groupon for the specific event you chose. Other than that: great app!
1372,Jaredatl10,"May 28, 2018",1,Worst customer service ever. It‚Äôs all a scam. Don‚Äôt buy stuff off Groupon. It‚Äôs always misleading. The items aren‚Äôt as advertised and if you try to cancel they hold your money hostage. On top of waiting months for items to ship. You get it and it‚Äôs the cheap version of what you bought. They do not care about their customers. I have to wait a month for item to ship so I can return it. I canceled and changed order within allotted time and followed their rules and all they can say is sorry for your experience. They can‚Äôt cancel an item that ships a month from now. False advertising.

It‚Äôs going on three weeks and the shipping carrier has no information to give me about my package and Groupon has NO SERVICE NUMBER whatsoever. This seems very fraudulent. I will be doing business with honest companies going forward. It‚Äôs not worth the savings if you never even receive your items and can‚Äôt ask a human being at the company where your order went. What kind of company doesn‚Äôt have a customer service line??"
1374,Grouponislife,"July 10, 2018",5,Awesome customer service I‚Äôve never had any issues with purchases on Groupon and I must say I order almost every week.

Now in a national crisis and I placed an order for an item and not a service, the item never shipped as there is no stock and they will not refund my money. They offer Groupon bucks which makes you buy something you do not need in a national crisis. My money can be put to better use than being ripped off in a national crisis. Shame on you for falsely selling items you do not have then not refunding the money. Your company is a disgrace during this crisis and I will never use your company again."
1385,anita918,"April 4, 2020",5,Easy to use and always good prices! Groupon remembers items I like. Their app is easy to use and their prices are very good.

Excellent policy!

What I couldn‚Äôt deal with, was that customer service could not give any reason why it was cancelled, and they said not to order anything until the issue was resolved. How can you resolve an issue if you have no idea what the issue is. And why can‚Äôt I order anything at all?

Worth the couple of dollars a month, you don‚Äôt even notice them."
1390,gypsyfit,"June 5, 2019",2,"Bad luck with businesses on Groupon The last few times I‚Äôve purchased Groupons for local businesses they‚Äôve been disappointments or have been impossible to get a hold of or closed up shop altogether. It appears that Groupon is a graveyard for dying businesses trying to get noticed and giving one last pathetic effort to ramp up customers. In addition, Groupon never gives you your money back‚Äîthey always make you do a Trade-In, which gets annoying when none of them have worked out thus far."
1391,Babs in Oregon,"December 3, 2019",5,"Groupon prices are great I have bought many items and services through Groupon since about 2014.

In the many years of using only had one horrible experience, where returning the item was such a chore, it arrived broken, I ended up just throwing it away. In spite of this one experience, all other purchases have been easy, seamless and good value products and services."
1393,preciousgoldie,"November 3, 2019",4,"Easiest and best Groupon has always had a better price then anywhere else.  The only complaint I have is if you pay with Apple Pay, it would not let me change the order.  There is no phone number anywhere to call Groupon either. I hit the wrong amount and immediately realized it, but because I had used Apple Pay, it said no changes.  Now I Pay differently"

She ended the chat before I could confirm and then blocked me from doing another live chat. I checked the status of my Groupon and it was no different from before. I have canceled everything and won‚Äôt use Groupon again! Customer service is huge, and they failed big time!"

1398,ATCBob,"July 4, 2019",4,Usually works great I usually have a 5 star experience with Groupon.  Great deals.  You must read & follow the fine print!  Sometimes a small hassle there.  My complaints are-sometimes seller changes redeem by date-I had one expire early & lost out.  I had my Groupon account hacked once & had to start new account.  And occasionally seller has issues with booking Groupon-which is why I posted 4 stars.
1399,cp4/,"June 28, 2019",5,"Good, if random, selection If you need a spontaneous idea for a date or weekend activity, Groupon can pay off.

Groupon doesn‚Äôt bother to verify information. Some businesses require advance reservations or appointments but a lot of the businesses don‚Äôt call you back. Trade in offers cheat you out of well paid money because they charge you for trading in.

1466,SandyJovayc,"August 6, 2018",5,Convenient and Helpful App Groupon is great if your looking for a service and want to try the vendor first at a discount price without going all in. If you don‚Äôt like them you didn‚Äôt have to pay full price to find out. If you do like them it‚Äôs a win-win.  I found a great hair stylist who only charged $40 for a haircut and dry in San Mateo where the average price is normally $60.

1468,Ray Ray 253,"April 28, 2020",5,Saving money Be aware you are still responsible for the tax about $5.  No big deal but just making people aware.  This saved me about $30 so get it.  Also they do a very professional job here!  I like that you get to sit in your car while they do it instead of a closet they call a waiting room like some of the competition
1469,rochi__,"March 22, 2020",5,Perfect for online shopping I have used Groupon for about 4 years now and I love it!! I‚Äôm not one that enjoys going to the mall in the first place all online shopping is my go-to which is why I love using Groupon for just that because their deals are good and the items are just as described every time I‚Äôve made a purchase through them.
1470,LQQKNUP,"March 7, 2020",1,Lousy return procedure Groupon is great until you have to return something. I attempted to return a defective Bluetooth device within 2 days of receipt and followed all the instructions but the return procedure would not work. Made numerous attempts to contact someone at Groupon (there is no phone number that works) and when I finally figured out how to contact them via text - and that was no easy task - they were of absolutely no help. I was told that I‚Äôd have to take issue with the seller and Groupon wouldn‚Äôt provide that contact information. Rotten way to run a business.
1471,TamAdams,"March 1, 2020",5,"Great app! So many savings! What‚Äôs not to love! If you know ahead of time what you‚Äôre looking for this is a great avenue to save money, and thanks to customer ratings you never have to worry whether you‚Äôre wasting your money on a dud. I do wish the filters allowed me to get more specific and sometimes searches can be a drag but it‚Äôs so worth the savings!"
1472,V loves J,"November 27, 2019",5,So easy! Love shopping on Groupon! Easy to search for what you need and a few clicks...you‚Äôre done! I like the variety of products and services. But...I like that I can usually locate items from past put chase...still at that discounted Groupon rate! Almost like shopping at the flea market on the internet...never know what you‚Äôll find!
1473,Bella Baru,"November 11, 2019",5,Great way to save money! I have been using Groupon for a couple of years. It‚Äôs a great way to save money and try out new vendors and services for a very reasonable price.  I have found several people through Groupon that I stick with consistently. I‚Äôve also bought some great products over the years. I‚Äôm very happy with Groupon at this point!
1474,PatGudi,"October 31, 2019",2,"Groupon I don‚Äôt plan to purchase groupons again. You have billed me 3 different times for other person‚Äôs Groupon. I have no ideal if I have money on my account or what my account number is.  I have tried to do a chat but they never seem to know what I am referring to. I was comfortable using Groupon when there was a phone number to call and a live person would help me but you don‚Äôt have that anymore.  I think using theEntertainment Book is just as good, or getting coupons from some of the restaurants.   "
1475,Ms Gallivant,"October 25, 2019",4,"Money is worth it! Mobile app is user friendly and customer service is quite helpful and fairly quick to respond. One flaw that‚Äôs disappointing is that discounts are not retroactive to items you‚Äôve just purchased. So just make sure you double check for discounts 1st. The Groupon Select is definitely worth the $$ when you enjoy pampering yourself with massage, beauty, etc."
1476,ricky boy blu,"October 19, 2019",5,A website like no they! Groupon offers exceptional deals on certain things that you couldn‚Äôt find anywhere else like museums restaurants tours. They also have good customer service if there‚Äôs ever a problem if they can‚Äôt return your money they‚Äôll give you credit to the account which is just as good

1479,Dinequeta,"September 25, 2019",1,Horrible Groupon is honestly a waste of time. There is so much in the fine print and additional fees you don‚Äôt get a deal at all. I had an expired voucher that could not be credited for another purchase. So the customer service advised me to sell it online and it clearly states in the policies that they can not be resold. So you want me to break a policy to sell my voucher for less but you can‚Äôt give me a simple credit. I‚Äôm not asking for a REFUND... you are honestly better off going directly to the vendors. Also the customer service is unbelievably horrible. They are not understanding and rude a hell.
1480,hornyguy60,"April 2, 2019",5,"Groupon app I really enjoy Groupon. Their products are well represented, and are usually a good value. I have purchased everything from a refurbished vacuum, to I phone accessories. All good. No complaints. I had to return one item that I ordered in error. As it turned out, Groupon issued immediate site credit, and told me not to worry about returning the item. "
1481,PSmashey,"April 15, 2019",3,"Terrifying return and refund It's like getting on a merry-go-round! I cannot believe the amount of time I have spent trying to correct a situation, which was my fault admittedly. I wanted to increase my purchase. I ordered one piece of luggage and decided to go for the whole set."
1482,Judy Brosky,"May 9, 2019",5,I love Groupon deals! This is amazing!  I just purchased their subscription for $4.99/month and I‚Äôve already saved a lot more than that will cost me over the 6-months that I‚Äôm committed to keeping it.  I wish I purchased it yesterday before I bought the other things I bought.  Better late than never though.
1483,Burbankbaby,"September 20, 2019",5,"Using Groupon means you are one smart cookie I can‚Äôt imagine any major or minor purchase that I can‚Äôt make for a lot less if I check Groupon first.  It‚Äôs just as good when I‚Äôm traveling as when I‚Äôm near home.  When I can‚Äôt use a coupon out of town or before it expires, customer service makes sure I get an exchange or a refund.   I‚Äôm cheap, but I‚Äôm not dumb."
1484,Keithkos1,"August 27, 2019",4,"Can find great prices and too keep up to date on current events and items Ie on vacation now, so instead of trying to research things to do with my family I use Groupon.

1485,86568854,"August 25, 2019",5,"Great way to save I like groupon because I get to purchase items at a discounted rate; items that I‚Äôd ordinarily buy anyway and items that let me try something new to see if I like it. The savings are instant. In addition, when there is a problem using the purchase voucher, the Groupon staff works quickly to resolve the issue. That‚Äôs paramount."
1486,KG327,"August 20, 2019",3,"Love the deals! I love the deals you get on groupon. It isn't saving a few bucks here and there, it's saving substantial amounts per deal. It is great for trying new things or places before investing too much into something you are less familiar with. "
1487,KTLBI,"July 30, 2019",5,"VALUE Everything I have ever purchased through Groupon has been of exceptional quality and reasonably priced. I recommend that everyone check Groupon‚Äòs prices before making any purchases. Restaurants, hotels, entertainment, food, gifts, clothing, furniture. The list is endless and you will be pleasantly surprised with how much value you get for your money!"
1488,Samorrow52,"July 9, 2019",5,Groupons are fabulous I like using Groupons because it makes decisions easier because you buy in advance after you take all the time you need to look at each offer and it takes the pressure off deciding what you eat or do after you get to your destination. Also like getting discounts so we can do more
1489,mmmmmmegs,"June 12, 2019",5,Great deals and customer service The deals are awesome to take advantage of when you‚Äôre out of town. They also definitely use automated systems for their customer service but it‚Äôs quick and efficient. I‚Äôve dealt with automated customer service with many other companies and this one is by far the best I have encountered. Kuddos to that Groupon üëå
1490,antkbetta,"September 11, 2018",4,Overall good Have found a lot of beauty and experience deals on Groupon. Most have been worth the money. Bought a few things that broke quickly and were cheap but i think what I‚Äôve saved overall makes it a useful place to buy things. I would recommend buying products which have been reviewed if you want to avoid losing money at all.
1491,haysyd,"September 11, 2018",3,"Rooster Mat Love Groupon and don‚Äôt usually have any issues. However, I purchased a ROOSTER kitchen mat and received a Cafe‚Äô one. I know this can easily be returned, which I plan to do. I suggest that Groupon have some sort of way to return and resend the correct item. It‚Äôs not my fault someone picked the wrong item but now you are holding MY money until you receive the returned item. It‚Äôs like, oh we screwed up? You‚Äôll have to do all of the leg work. Not very good customer service in my opinion."
1492,tonita L,"October 13, 2018",4,"Customer support A Lina M from customer support needs to be fired, she was so rude and obviously doesn‚Äôt care about the groupon customers at all, she told me should couldn‚Äôt do anything for me to help out with a problem so I went to ask help from a different person from customer support. I believe his name was Santiago or something and helped me in less than a min! Thank you so much for caring about the customers."
1493,AJS10,"October 25, 2018",5,Love Groupon! I love Groupon and have tried new services and restaurants because of it.  One of my favorite features is the reviews - I always read those to see what prior customers have to say.  I like the mileage and map provided on each Groupon.   I like that they often provide if there is parking and if it is kid friendly or not.  Thanks Groupon for great service!
1494,cheekebaby,"October 29, 2018",5,"Money saver !!! You shouldn‚Äôt always expect to find what your looking for on Groupon, unless it simply to save money of course. I‚Äôve never had a bad product from Groupon. They have so many options and it‚Äôs great that it‚Äôs for any locations I may be in. Only annoying part is promo codes I have no idea where to get one if there are any :("

I recommend highly!"
1500,OLD myrt,"April 2, 2018",5,Great Deals all the time! I shop Groupon almost daily because they have such great deals on things I shop for and the quality is always great.

1501,Zombie Cooler,"April 28, 2018",3,"Great deals but negative policy changes... Love the many wonderful, money saving Groupon offers! Gave this 3/5 stars due to the company‚Äôs two major (negative) changes: (1) shipping options with certain vendors is no longer available and (2) customer service can only be reached via email or live chat (when available). These changes have NOT been an improvement to the customer experience. Please go back to the original business policy. Thank you."

Be careful that you read the fine print on specific items so that you get exactly what you want! This app always works on my phone and is even easy for someone technically challenged as I am.
1505,43344334yupo,"July 31, 2018",4,"Convenient for checking for groupons right before you walk in somewhere The app gives WAY too many notifications, to the point that they‚Äôre basically meaningless.

1506,richon8162,"August 11, 2018",1,Worst purchase experience ever This was my first product purchase and will be my last. Finding a customer service agent was just impossible I had to click on pages like I was trying to start a business to get to the live chat. This is unacceptable. I was told that I was going to get all the purchase refund to Groupon bucks only to find out it was only partly done. I was charged shipping on purchases that I should not have.

Kept explaining how to do a Return, as if I was mentally deficient. If I wanted the correct item, I have to re-purchase the item. Since the sale is over, it will cost me MORE money to correct THEIR mistake. Contacted Live Chat twice and emailed them twice. Finally got a $6 credit so I could reorder the item I wanted. Only way I got this was by explaining that ‚ÄúBait and Switch‚Äù Is illegal in the US. Believe Customer Service is overseers. Still have to return unwanted item. It‚Äôs a nightmare."
1510,klpklpklp,"February 23, 2018",3,Groupon Like it. Usually good buys. Sometimes the quality is disappointing in shoes and such tho. I dislike the sporadic shipping charges disclosed at checkout. The sets of art books etc are confusing cuz you pay then you find out it‚Äôs only a voucher. You must redeem at a website and pay big shipping chgs like $15 for a coloring book. Undisclosed and customer service is awful. There TAKE10 coupons or whatever NEVER work and talk text to the customer svc is a joke. Maybe a 2 ‚≠êÔ∏è

I can also find some really quality items for lower prices even lower than other apps or websites.

But just do your research and you come out with a deal! Love Groupon!

The second time, I had to update the shipping address as the seller won‚Äôt send to a PO Box.

The Groupons are easy to use and if there‚Äôs any issue with the Groupon you bought, then Groupon is really great about setting things right. I would definitely recommend them!"

If you want to find a new local food spot or something to do in the area and get a deal on it, there is simply no other option. Stop reading my review and download it already, I promise you won't regret it!"
1544,4Savings,"September 30, 2018",5,"Amazing I love that I can go on Groupon and find coupons and deals quick and easy and on top of that even at times apply another coupon for double, sometimes triple the savings. It always keeps me updated with the events happening in Vegas, just Love Groupon it is one app that will never be deleted from my phone!!"
1545,ChicagoBri,"November 15, 2018",1,Zero Customer Service. Scammers I‚Äôve tried Groupon to purchase two completely different services. In both cases the service provider would no honor the Groupon. In one case they just wouldn‚Äôt call you back for an appointment when you mentioned you had a Groupon.  I would not recommend buying Groupons for most services.  Groupon has no customer service for these instances and does not even have a customer service number to call and explain your issue. They don‚Äôt have an easily recognizable issue resolution process and in the end your out of luck.
1546,jess3rach,"November 18, 2018",5,"Works well We have used Groupon  a number of times and it has worked well for us every time. We have never had any delays in shipping, the prices are reasonable, and the variety of items they gives you many choices. Groupon is easy to use for anyone and it makes shopping alot less of a hastle."
1547,Grouponjunky70,"November 26, 2018",4,Almost always 100 percent satisfaction I‚Äôve used Groupon for many years and only have had a couple of bad experiences or purchasing problems. I bought a massage and was never able to redeem due to not being able to reach the massage therapist. Never redeemed my massage and have seen Groupon deals offered from this same place many times after ( with bad reviews)!
1548,Tara - Sarah,"December 31, 2018",5,I find so many new great places I‚Äôm love the Groupon concept and their easy app. I‚Äôm not a big bargain shopper though I do find a lot of great new places that are now some of my favorites. I‚Äôve had very good experiences and also have enjoyed their merchandise. I believe they give businesses opportunities to draw in a lot of business at affordable prices for the customers.
1549,Who knew me too,"January 12, 2019",5,Groupons I'm a big fan of Groupon's. Have used them for years. I get to try different restaurants and spa services.  They are a true value.  Every now and then a new business might close; however Groupon will give you back credit for what you paid.  That is fine with me because I can just buy a new Groupon.  Give it a try.
1550,Jceer,"April 23, 2018",5,"The beat deals I love Groupon, the variety of items and the prices keep me coming back weekly. As an artist I am able to try all varieties of colored pencils which is the medium I am currently using.

1552,kimwillnevergrouponagain,"May 12, 2018",1,"NO STARS After I review my orders and complete my actual purchases I will never ever use this complicated scam again! It‚Äôs designed to complicate and mislead buyers and rope them into forced spending. For example, have you ever bought a pair of jeans but only have 24 hours to return them or else you will lose the ability to get a refund! I have had multiple bad experiences with this app! No wonder it has a bad reputation, especially and the rude agent I chatted with for way too long didn‚Äôt help with her unprofessional and childish attitude! Pratyrush, I believe was her name but you can check the history."

1555,Bute 38,"July 4, 2018",5,Groupon Groupie I love how Groupon gives you an affordable chance to try something out which I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise. Plus by giving us good deals it introduces us to the merchandise and the companies. I also appreciate the reminders that I have not used a certain groupon that I have purchased in recent weeks or months.
1556,TigerWizards,"July 13, 2018",5,Great App for Groupon It's fast and a smooth purchase. I like to browse through the list of offers. The graphics are excellent. Only one product has been of poor quality (didn't look like the pic) of my many purchases. I find items on Groupon that I can't find in stores or with other online merchants. Thanks Groupon!
1557,like the G,"July 20, 2018",5,"Great, Convenient with great deals Very happy that Groupon is around. Makes it easy for me to make purchases at a good bargain. A wonderful way to explore businesses, products; travel opportunities, etc. This way, if I want to go back to that same merchant or business, having first tried it through Groupon with a great experience, I will continue to be loyal."

I browse Groupon in the quiet hours at home for fun and to my surprise I always end up ordering an item I didn‚Äôt know I wanted or needed. With the exception of one top, I‚Äôve always enjoyed my whim purchase... and it is just 3 taps to get it delivered to my door!"

Excellent company and app. Highly recommend!"

I needed an oil change and i bought a conventional oil change and when i got to the shop they told me full synthetic and so they told me conventional wasn‚Äôt the best option/ and i used the trade in feature and was able to use the price of the first one and add that to the voucher i actually needed !! That was awesome I love groupons. Convenient and saves money

I went to my bank to get the money refunded and Groupon said that I had never reached out to get the issue I resolved done, which I had. Overall just another big corporation trying to penny pence loyal customers who had been shopping with them for years. $79 they stole, just a terrible company top to bottom. I won‚Äôt be giving then anymore if my money."
1569,jtf109,"November 27, 2019",4,Good place to buy I usually only get restaurants and events which they give a great discount price.  A great way to try a new restaurant.  Purchased a few items which some I kept and very happy with.

Try it yourself and see, they have more things to do than six flags!"
1571,Zampheed,"November 20, 2019",4,"Check prices on web, but lots of great deals can be had! Many times the ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô price shown is wildly inflated to make the ‚Äòdeal‚Äô seem awesome. Kind of a shady practice in my opinion. Check around in the web though, because there are some great deals to be had thru Groupon...just be smart about it before you buy. I‚Äôve never had a problem with returns or deliveries."
1572,alexisj29,"October 26, 2019",1,Don‚Äôt bother putting your credit card it‚Äôs a scam I did everything they ask for me to do but when it‚Äôs time to credit my card they say I didn‚Äôt use that card? I told them I only have one card and I double check the number and it‚Äôs correct but they didn‚Äôt care because they wanna scam like 40 to 50% of people that use Groupon and I am one of them so be careful. I did talk to support but seem like they are in India or Nigeria and can‚Äôt communicate properly so I ask for someone else to contact me and guess what they blew me off and haven‚Äôt spoke to anyone since.
1573,Dewberry June,"October 21, 2019",5,super helpful to save on everyday needs and to add special touch to life! I love to search for services and items on Groupon as desired and needed to save money on the spot.

1578,Kimberynichol,"August 7, 2019",5,Great deals and Groupon keeps their money guaranteed They used to give you a hard time about getting your money back if the merchant refuses to honor and give you the money value of the groupon. But now Groupon gives you your money back in Groupon bucks. It‚Äôs not perfect but at least you get reimbursed unlike how they did it years ago.
1579,Slow Interact,"June 29, 2019",4,"Convenient With Real Discounts Groupon offers a convenient way to find a wide range of discounted items for purchase. Some items are easier to purchase where the item ships direct. Others, such as restaurant discounts, require printing a certificate to take with you. I wish there were a better way to do those. Otherwise, this is a very helpful online service."

My daughter always gets pictures from JCPenney via a Groupon deal. We even went to Disney and stayed in a hotel just outside the property from Groupon. The hotel was amazing with an equally amazing price. I always check Groupon before I buy anything big
1582,TwstdLeggs,"May 5, 2019",5,Groupon Shopper I absolutely love this site. I was able to find amazing.. fabulous.. reasonably priced items for the whole family at the holidays. They loved them all!! Thanks Groupon!!

Panicking, b/c I had not started my Christmas shopping, my sister told me about Groupon!  I did all my shopping from the comfort of my room in less than a week! I continue to enjoy checking for gifts and browsing every evening!"
1585,DavidAki,"May 16, 2019",4,Almost awesome A little hard to navigate at times. I sometimes have problems with check out. You have to do extra homework to make sure the deal works for you. Like the Samba deal. Great price but Samba is only open for dinner after 5pm. It was looking for lunch. Made it harder to arrange my outing. More info on the deal would have been helpful makes it hard to try unfamiliar things.
1586,Ditch Logan,"May 22, 2019",5,"More than a great app! This is by far, one of my favorite applications!  I don't typically give applications 5 stars (even those I like a lot), but this is one I simply can not give a top rating to... Not only can it save you money (: but it also lets you know about very cool stuff to do in your area!  If you've got the cash, pick this one up... Cheers all!"
1587,miltonsgrammy,"May 22, 2019",4,"Need more options I get great deals, but many that I would purchase can not be purchased unless one is a first-time customer.  This often causes me to just delete Groupon notices rather than waste time scrolling through the ads."
1588,Kreestion,"June 16, 2019",4,"Fun stuff, new things to try I like Groupon because it suggests fun things that add excitement to life, such as T-shirts with fun sayings, trendy or fun clothing for special occasions, and essential oils‚Äîsomething I use daily in my personal life and in my classroom. They can brighten my day, enhance the mood in the home or classroom, and can even help with allergies, breathing, and headaches. On the negative side, the quality of some items i have purchased has been low."
1589,Drew...Turned Up!,"June 12, 2019",5,"Groupon is THE BUSINESS!! I gotta say, Groupon has become my #1 Go to Before I spend a DIME these days!

It‚Äôs the ultimate value in this short life we have. ENJOY IT!!"
1590,wyocwbygrl,"November 27, 2018",5,Great site I love shopping on Groupon. Their prices are less than other sites and if they are out of what you want they let you know when it‚Äôs back in stock as long as it‚Äôs still in your cart. I always receive fast service and have never been dissatisfied with any products or services I have received.
1591,Cda Lake Liver,"November 30, 2018",5,Love it I have bought several concert tickets and recently bought tickets to the North Idaho Fair. It's always super convenient to pick up the tickets wherever they are and the prices are generally a huge savings. I've also bought lots of flower bulbs and they have been tremendously successful.  Far beyond what I would've imagined. Thank you Groupon!

You have to make sure to read the fine print and understand what you‚Äôre buying but other than that I live for Groupon. Great for moms! Tons on place you can take the little ones on a budget.

I called them and email them so many times! Most of the times, they told me it is the technical problem and one time they said it was my bank denied the process which it was BS! I called my bank they said the Groupon never process the payment online. There was not shown on the record! No one from Groupon helped you to resolve the problems only told me wait 24-48 hours to try it again! I have to say the worst experience ever!"

I appreciate the willingness and helpful assistance that was generously provided to me. I will continue to support groupon."
1595,angeldoren,"February 6, 2019",4,"Suggestion to Groupon I only want to remind Groupon to let the restaurants know that many patrons use Groupon as an introduction to the establishment. It is not only my opinion but the opinion of friends and family that some establishments do short change you when a Groupon voucher is used. Again, not all restaurants do this, but the ones that do, are really shortchanging themselves in the long run."
1596,Rick#1Girl,"February 21, 2019",1,Tried to use $10 off deal. Had live chat with 2 reps and both disconnected. The first rep disconnected on me after we were conversing. Contacted another rep and she said that she could help and the credit card on file was not working because the credit card company said someone was trying to abuse it so they gave me a different number. I asked if she would hang on while I updated the credit card. She said she would but then she disconnected now I have no order no discount and a big waste of time. I am frustrated with Groupon and hope that they will contact me
1597,Lehuawise,"March 5, 2019",5,Amazing I love being able to find things to do and shop for all in one place. Another great way of sending gifts to people without having to go into stores and often more creative gifts through this app. 
1598,EARLDSp,"March 17, 2019",5,"Earldsp This app make it fun to try new things with a few people and not breaking the bank.

I try to plan when I buy an outing. I lost one because I couldn‚Äôt find anyone to go with me. I read reviews carefully. I don‚Äôt always care about the things others complain about. But sometimes it has been nice to be forewarned. "

1603,misslill_red,"May 31, 2018",5,"Groupon offers the opportunity for you to try new things due to the reasonable prices. In this particular case I just paid $15 for an online yoga package.  I enjoy hot yoga but am having trouble fitting it into my schedule. Being able to attend a class any time is something I would welcome. It‚Äôs also expensive, so this price is a welcome change."

I really didn‚Äôt want the credit, I really want the Apple battery backup keychain.  The girl said she could not reorder it, and could only issue a credit.  Then she advised me, that i am not  eligible for future refunds.  I love ordering from Groupon, but this might be a game changer for me.  Can you check my account to see if i ever returned anything?  I don‚Äôt believe i did.   Thank you "
1605,Nish712,"September 15, 2018",5,"Trade In Feature The last three times I have had to trade in a Groupon, the customer support team has been very quick and helpful.

Thanks for being so flexible with my trade ins."
1606,SELWJL,"September 22, 2018",3,Good products most of the time I have enjoyed using Groupon for the most part. The positive side is that most of the time you DO get good products at a discounted price. The bad side is: I have ordered sandals and cannot find them anywhere to order more. I have ordered an Adirondack wooden chair that was cheap and fell apart. And if you buy something with a ‚Äúvoucher‚Äù you have a limited time to use it. Bottom line = READ ALL THE FINE PRINT and you should be happy with your purchases!

Not the truth, If the vendor no longer does business with Groupon (Maybe less than honorable, not sure) BUT I do know Groupon ONLY reimbursed me 1/2 off what I paid.  Be safe and only order products or goods.  I will not use them to order a service again."
1609,43575778,"November 23, 2018",5,You gotta be kidding me Yup. That‚Äôs the title.

1610,Samwyse,"February 16, 2018",5,"A happy surprise every day ""Sure, not every deal is for everyone but even a few deals a week are better than none."" That was then, this is now.

When things come out wrong or unfair etc and you need attention from customer service on a matter, it has been most difficult and uneasy to the point where I have lost money. If they had a stronger customer service, I would think Groupon is more reliable and would care about the people who purchase through them."

I have never had a problem with them whatsoever. It‚Äôs rare that I return anything because the items are usually true to their description. I highly recommend Groupon!
1620,Dinopanda7,"November 7, 2019",1,"Terrible experience Bought a great deal yesterday around 1pm. Thought it was odd that I didn‚Äôt get a voucher right away. They emailed me at 1am telling me there was an issue with the transaction. Of course, the email comes after the promotion is over. Good luck trying to contact customer support for help. Talked to a live chat that said they couldn‚Äôt help me .. they told me my deal is on a sale today .. $4 off as opposed to me 20% off $199 yesterday, definitely not the same thing. I tried to request for a call back and send an email and coincidentally they were unavailable."

1623,uwbs,"September 6, 2019",3,"Difficult Customer Support Overall I like the Groupon app and deals. However if you want to edit an order to change an shipping address or credit card the customer support prompts make it very difficult. The options are limited which causes me to cancel the order and start back over. Also I‚Äôm not able to accumulate all of my purchases in one cart, I have to place separate orders. (ie..product and a service)"

So I grabbed some Fantasy Island tickets! And ‚Äúwe‚Äôre off‚Äù! I hope this is legit and works as smoothly as it was to make an account and purchase the tickets!! If it‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù than I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with this experience!! I‚Äôll check back later!"
1626,Cubba!,"August 29, 2019",4,Great deals on products and activities. Overall I like and enjoy shopping on Groupon. I typically check on the site prior to buying with a different vendor.  I have gotten some amazing deals and will continue to be a Groupon customer.  My negative review would be that Shipping can have more wait time than others and on an occasion I receive the wrong order (usual the color or design).
1627,Jen Miyako,"August 24, 2019",5,"Easy search experience After pioneering the online coupon business years ago, Groupon is still able to continually offer a great variety of options in every category while maintaining a great user experience.

1629,GiggleKatt,"July 10, 2019",5,Fun to shop!!! Groupon always has interesting and innovative items to sell.  The prices are good and the website is easy to maneuver around.  I like that if we are going to travel somewhere I can change the search to that location and find things to do at a discount.  Tickets in hand or on phone!
1630,TommyFrito,"February 14, 2019",3,"Customer Service Lacking Though I‚Äôm still involved in a love affair with Groupon, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that only having live chat available through their FB site for customer service matters is clearly dropping the ball in this regard. Having a direct telephone line was slightly better but only slightly as I could hardly understand the broken English of the outsourced service reps. Cmon, Groupon, you can do better than this as it pertains to customer service!!!"
1631,nicole539,"March 15, 2019",1,"Groupon customers service Representative on the phone didn‚Äôt seem to care about my issue. Passed it off to a supervisor because he was unable to figure out the issue. He said IF it requires a phone call they‚Äôll call back. If not they‚Äôll follow up by email. It really pisses me off because this is my information, my card number and I feel it‚Äôs being compromised. I can‚Äôt login in to my account it‚Äôs frustrating. When I told him I‚Äôll be deleting the app and would like my information erased he didn‚Äôt seem to care. Why should he? Very frustrating."

I‚Äôve purchased a weekend getaway for Branson last fall and it was wonderful!!! I would do that again in a heartbeat. The prices are are really good and it allows me to do things I normally wouldn‚Äôt. So, I‚Äôd say Groupon is a good thing!"
1633,Pre cha,"March 25, 2019",5,Quality Men‚Äôs shoes with low budget Great platform to buy anything you need at low price. You spend more money driving around to different stores or more time shopping at different online stores and still won‚Äôt find lower than clearance sales. One stop shopping for me for no on.

I always look on Groupon before I go out to dinner, to see if there‚Äôs a good deal out there, and I usually find one for half off the full price for a meal!

1637,ywyeuejshusiwiwjveisiqbeidb,"May 1, 2019",4,Make it easier to order more I think you have very good value in many of your products. One suggestion is that you could make it easier to purchase additional items. I recently ordered black fleece lined leggings for my girlfriend and wanted to get her two pairs. After several attempts I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to order the black and grey pair so you lost a potential order.
1638,Kytri,"May 4, 2019",1,"Done with Groupon The app is fine although it can be tricky because it is not always intuitive. But Groupon itself has gotten worse over the years because of poor vendors. And then there is no good,  quality customer service behind this. It goes like this: buy a deal, deal bad, send several emails, get a refund-IN GROUPON BUCKS (not cash), buy a new deal, had angry because the cycle starts again-sigh, hands to head, repeat over and over until you think you‚Äôre crazy for trying it again....you‚Äôll never ever see your money again."

1641,Marchelles,"October 19, 2018",5,"Great way to save I‚Äôve been using Groupon for years. You can search for restaurants in your area for special occasions or the weekly pizza that keeps the kids happy. Find massages, nail salons (link to book appointments) and oil changes. Now that we have a newer car, I can ever search for synthetic oil changes. "
1642,Cavachonmom,"November 8, 2018",5,Consistent service and quality I have been using Groupon for over two years now. I have been pleasantly surprised by how consistent they are.

I called the customer service line to request information on the refunds, and was hung up on by the first person. The second person proceeded to tell me that the reason they hung up is that it was not his department. I was then informed that she could let me speak to a supervisor but ONLY if I agree to undergo a promotional offer.

I have enjoyed every purchase I have made and will recommend if you give it a try you too will not be disappointed."
1652,John Boise,"June 20, 2018",4,"Good but some improvements are needed I enjoy using Groupon. Although, some services offer deals that are not honest. For instance, a service i inquired about offered a two for one for 20$. They stated that one ticket was 20$. Therefore, the Groupon voucher would save me 20$ It turns out that an actually ticket was 12$. Therefore 2 tickets would be 24$. Saving me only 4$. IMO services that mislead the consumer should be pulled from Groupon."

1656,kb from nyc,"August 9, 2018",4,Great for kids/family activities I would Have put five stars except I always forget to check the homepage for additional coupon codes.

The refund process was a bit annoying. One place was still pending and I just wanted to cancel it. (Wasn‚Äôt charged for it yet) Another place I cancelled. I had to live chat for a bit with someone to make sure they were both canceled. It wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal but I just wished they had given me the best price to begin with.

1669,63lc,"February 27, 2020",1,Previously wonderful now a nightmare I have attempted to make the same purchase 5 or more times over multiple days and Groupon will not process or sends notice is a bogus decline hours later when the applicable discounts no longer apply.  I have used many credit cards and 2 cards through Apple Pay.  The bank did not decline any  transactions as reported by Groupon.  Groupon never submitted a transaction.  This is not worth the effort and I‚Äôm disappointed that an app I previously loved is now useless and more of an annoyance and frustration than a value.
1670,Annie4094,"February 26, 2020",5,Groupon I have used Groupon a few times since 2013.  I have never had a problem redeeming the groupons.  Pretty much everyone is familiar with Groupon now.  That makes it even more awesome.

I had a laptop that was missing and QVC replaced right away.  I bought a lot of Groupon this year and had very few problems.  Well I had an $11 order missing and called Groupon and they refused to do any action.  I now have another one missing and I know there will be no action.  Therefore I can never buy anything from Groupon.   BTW I am not missing any packages from anywhere else.

1774,R12P9B8,"August 4, 2018",5,"Great products at great prices Always enjoy browsing through the deals on Groupon. So far all the items I have purchased (only about 5) have been great. With anything you run the risk of something defective, but with simple return policies, it makes things easier. Waiting to pull the trigger on one of the trip/getaways."
1775,Kurlysue5,"August 6, 2018",4,Great n easy..... but can we earn discounts? I buy tons of stuff on Groupon great deals   Great vacation packages  easy and convenient to buy things
1776,katrixa,"August 7, 2018",5,"Great place Lots of items, and places, or just deals to be had! Been using them for years, if I ever have an issue I usually give them a call in regards to merchandise or customer service with Groupon vouchers or places acting indifferent. Most of everything ever purchased has been great! Always read fine prints tho !"
1777,Loroxy1118,"August 10, 2018",5,"Groupon This app exceeds all my expectations so far!   I've heard so much about the app, I tend to be pessimistic about apps and getting scammed.   This is the real deal, finally somewhere other than a big store name where I can get just about anything always less expensive and zero hassles that usually come with the average shopping excursion!"
1778,littlejenn5$,"August 10, 2018",4,Pricing I enjoy Groupon and use it often however sometimes the prices are misleading. For example today I viewed an offer for something I have had my eye on and it stated that today only the item was being offered with an additional $5 off the price. I decide to purchase 2 of the item and my total price did not include the additional $5 off.
1779,ScorpioDF53,"August 21, 2018",3,"Great!!!  But......... I like Groupon and there are may items I am interested in....However, I am furious over the delivery options. When trying to order, I find they don‚Äôt ship to my address OR my P.O. BOX.... I live in the Mts of SoCal.  So, I have to ship to my Sister who lives an hour and half away.  AND, there is no easy access to decent Customer Support.  And, no phone access..... I did buy the one thing but I guess Groupon is going to be too difficult to use......"
1780,AlkDavis,"February 13, 2018",5,"Great way to try some place new! I love Groupon!  I can try that new restaurant without breaking the bank.  This way if I don‚Äôt like it, I don‚Äôt feel like I over paid.  If I love it, I will be back and pay full price!  I don‚Äôt mind paying good money for good food and services and this give me the opportunity to find out if they deliver on their end!"
1781,Westburbchicago,"March 21, 2018",5,"I‚Äôve saved thousands! It‚Äôs safe to say that in the last 6 years that I‚Äôve used Groupon, I‚Äôve save well over a thousand dollars on everything from cell phone chargers to many many awesome relaxing massages.

1784,LOLOFOSHODOUNODO,"May 21, 2018",5,Too Good! While there are some major duds on here that you need to look out for(products that might not work) this is my favorite shopping app ever. I‚Äôve done so many amazing things and get so many awesome products every month because of Groupon. I love how it connects you with local businesses so you can try them out.

1790,VA Dee,"April 9, 2020",5,Great Service I have always had a good experience ordering with Groupon. I‚Äôve had to contact customer service a few times but they helped me and were extremely polite and nice.  If I‚Äôve had to return a product it was no problem and a snap to do. Refunds right away. Just an all around great experience!
1791,Guinness's Father,"April 8, 2020",5,"Great discounts, easy purchase, quick delivery I bought air filters and received extra savings with Groupon Bucks.  Less than $40 total for 4 each of 2 different sized air filters.  I was really happy they were in stock.  I figured there would be a huge run on this item with the pandemic in full swing."
1792,lj mars,"April 6, 2020",1,"Disappointed Groupon should be ashamed of themselves for price gouging and selling items that do not match the description or available pictures. I used to like groupon, but it‚Äôs getting out of hand. Changing the details of an item to final sale once someone buys it, price gouging, charging a card multiple times even if you only made one purchase, or just not even sending out the purchased items... It‚Äôs ridiculous. Hopefully this helps some of you when going to make a purchase. Just be cautious as always with ANY retailer/seller."
1793,garbagesamsungapp,"March 29, 2020",2,Don‚Äôt stand behind the sales Purchased a groupon for a 1st day of school chalkboard. Ordered product with extra items from vendor. A week before school no product vendor said they were backlogged and I would have in October. Useless at that point.  W sir was great and refunded all extras thank bought. Groupon would not refund and gave me useless Groupon dollars that must have expired as I no longer have in my account. Very disappointed. First time Groupon was. It client friendly   I lost what I paid because vendor was backlogged.
1794,LisDad,"March 26, 2020",5,"Great deals!! I can‚Äôt say enough about Groupon has added to my entertainment life.

1796,Kikyjane,"March 19, 2020",5,"I'm in love I absolutely love groupon. I can't get enough. The only problem I have with groupon is that the vendors who use it for advertisement don't make much of a profit because Groupon keeps most of it. I usually try things with groupon, but if I really like the product I'll buy it directly from the source the next time."
1797,donnybrookworld,"March 5, 2020",5,"Jewelry! Jewelry! Jewelry! I absolutely love Groupon‚Äôs jewelry selection. I heard they were changing their business model and stepping away from things like consumer goods to services . I‚Äôd sure hate to see them stop selling stuff like jewelry and clothes. Because as long as the third party is reputable and verified, Groupon‚Äôs prices can‚Äôt be beat .... that‚Äôs just my opinion tho"

I just need to find out how to redeem credits when I have paid for Groupon items and never redeemed them. It says I don‚Äôt lose the value but I have yet to learn how to use that. That alone would make Groupon a better product. I would love to hear from you giving me that information Groupon!

1803,Elle B1,"January 8, 2020",5,"Great Deals! I have used Groupon for years. I have found and utilized some awesome deals, from personal care to automobile care. Although I‚Äôve had a few bad experiences with some of the service providers, Groupon has always been helpful in resolving the issues with great care and offering refunds without a problem."
1804,barbesab33,"December 21, 2019",5,Great overall I have enjoyed most products and services I've purchased through Groupon. My only disappointment is not being able to speak to someone directly like you used to when you have a problem or question. Overall still a great site!
1805,Dora1962*,"December 20, 2019",5,Great prices I have made several purchases from Groupon and have been satisfied every time. Great way to check out a product or service that you might hesitate to buy if the price were not discounted  through Groupon. Definitely would recommend you to check out Groupon.
1806,GimenaTheGemini,"November 27, 2019",5,"Haven‚Äôt bought much Haven‚Äôt bought much but just recently bought some cheap movie tickets! It‚Äôs given me a lot of ideas for celebrations in the future and with cheaper prices than the normal price! There‚Äôs a lot of tickets for events too, and I look forward to using the coupons!"
1807,judgeals,"October 18, 2019",5,Very Fair Policies I love Groupon.  I tend to buy personal service deals and sometimes you find out that you aren‚Äôt an ideal candidate for the service.  Or a Groupon accidentally expires and the merchant won‚Äôt honour the price paid.  Groupon has been excellent about turning those purchases into Groupon bucks which just encourages me to try more merchants.
1808,jleojr27,"October 6, 2019",5,Great App w/ Great Deals! I love using Groupon because it removes the barrier of cost to me and my partner having a great time when we‚Äôre looking for yummy food nearby or while on vacation! Plus it‚Äôs free! You can‚Äôt go wrong downloading this app! Especially if you read the reviews for products or restaurants that you‚Äôre considering using/visiting too!

1810,Ms patzi,"April 21, 2019",5,I‚Äôm a total addict! They sell stuff you didn‚Äôt know you couldn‚Äôt live without until you see it on Groupon LOL . In the past five years I have never been disappointed by the service or quality of the item. Groupon is a great way to explore a new city when traveling too Just love it!!! I‚Äôm all in forever. 
1811,Over the craziness,"May 22, 2019",2,Shipping I wanted to order two of the same product in different colors.  It stands to reason that they will be coming from the same shipping location if I‚Äôm ordering the same product.  The app wouldn‚Äôt allow me to order two on the same order so now I have to pay double shipping.  That means double packaging by the same shipper.  This tell me that the shipper is making money on the shipping.  Why not just increase the cost of the product and make your money in an honest fashion?
1812,west10jb,"May 26, 2019",4,"Groupon maturing, offering more usable choices! Groupon product offerings are becoming more useful, as there are broader selection of items that one generally does not find at local department stores.  There is an active effort to make usable and attractive services and products that can be used by a wide range of clients!  I use Groupon almost once or more per month for varied needs and wants. üëç!"
1813,Wawag44,"May 31, 2019",1,Customer service not reachable I like Groupon and use it a lot but there are often reasons to contact customer service (eg a company goes out of business and you‚Äôre stuck with a groupon with no value). The app used to have a way to reach out to customwr service. Now their ‚Äúcontact customer service‚Äù leads to a list of faqs and there is not a way to get help without a complex search for a proper email address and reaching out from ones home email. The difficulty reaching someone from the company has drastically reduced the value of this service and app.
1814,skins813,"June 2, 2019",2,"Disappointed in horrendous customer service They cancelled my order without any warning because my bank didn‚Äôt update my address and the address has to match what‚Äôs on the card. Mine should‚Äôve but the bank dropped the ball.  I got it straightened out, but by then the 25% off deal was over after I had wasted close to 3 hours over 2 days fighting with Groupon.  By the time they had the issue fixed, the item had sold out.  I haven‚Äôt heard from them about that."
1815,PearPerson,"September 2, 2019",5,"Using Groupon I use Groupon mainly to try new restaurants as well as use some of the offered services.  I have been very satisfied.  When I do run into a vendor issue, Groupon has been quick to meet my needs.  Groupon reps are very responsive and understanding.  I will continue to use Groupon happily.  You can always find great deals at Groupon!"
1816,Foodgiant,"August 5, 2019",3,Don‚Äôt like the buy now options only on some items. We can Don‚Äôt like the buy now option on these items I like to get a few things. Plus had an issue with another retailer and could not get help right away from Groupon they finally did help but at first the online helper were slow and not making sense.  I did get help a few days later but should not have to be this hard.
1817,Trish Pasta,"August 5, 2019",5,"Always trying new things Groupon‚Äôs platform to build businesses is great! I enjoy trying different workouts and instructors, as well as new foods.

1819,mooshan,"June 25, 2019",5,New groupon bucks usage I definitely notice the changes Groupin has made to be a better service for consumers. We can now reuse the unused groupon bucks and offers an affordable membership for extra discounts. I also had Groupon as a business owner and its a great way to get referrals instead pf paying for expensive ads.
1820,wheng27,"January 15, 2019",5,Wheng27 Groupon is a quick and easy way for me to shop when it comes to services. I love browsing into it as it provides a lot of choices for whatever I/you need. It also gives you an option of ‚Äútrade-in‚Äù if you simply change your mind into something else. Just perfect!
1821,Pride& Joy,"February 3, 2019",5,Groupon I love Groupon. They have great deals and excellent customer service. If something goes wrong they will make it right.

Keep the deals coming & excellent customer service & I'll always be a customer!! Thanks Groupon!!
1822,sopassion,"February 20, 2019",2,No customer service can‚Äôt get refunds when needed I have been a Groupon customer for many years and was very happy with them however as the company grew they cut back on adequate customer service. The last thing which occurred for a Groupon for a beauty appointment is that I made an appointment with the merchant to drive 40 minutes to be told that I‚Äôm not a candidate. I‚Äôve been trying for at least 1 week to get a refund with no success. I am very disappointed. Not planning to use much as before.
1823,k.nance,"March 4, 2019",5,Love love love I absolutely love Groupon. They always have the best deals on almost anything you can think of wanting. The shipping is usually really fast too.

1825,LittleWhittel,"March 14, 2019",3,"Amazing concept terrible customer support I love Groupon as a concept, the app functions well and I like buying deals for activities and such. BUT the one time I ordered an actual item Groupon went way over the delivery date, and I soon discovered there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. They don‚Äôt have a number you can call, the online chat is a sort of front so that if you have an actual problem it cannot be resolved. Super shady if you ask me."
1826,Phiiiiiaaaa,"March 30, 2019",5,Nothing better than Savings ! I use Groupon all the time whenever I travel and even for local activities and they never fail to bring me the best SALES and even more saving codes . What isn‚Äôt there to love ?

I appreciate the business that accept/ use Groupon as well as how simple it actually is to use the app and redeem your vouchers."
1831,Mercedes Hall,"July 11, 2018",2,"I love the deals, but the rules and customer service can sometimes be a hassle. Where the deals are amazing. It feels like their Customer Service is not ever on the same page. Some will actually be willing to realize you are being honest with them, some are not willing to hear anything you have to say and are smart mouthed all the time, some can be very rude, where some can give you the best customer service you‚Äôve ever had! You just never know what you‚Äôre gonna get."
1832,KAK1025,"July 22, 2018",5,"Reason I love Groupon.... Groupon has assisted me in finding the greatest salons, dr offices, and restaurants....all with minimal risk.  The great deals that are offered via Groupon get you into the place for a very discounted price, and you are then able to assess the offices, doctors, etc.  Then... you have a Fanta doctor, esthetician, massage therapist for life! I‚Äôd be more hesitant to try out services for the full price....so I LOVE GROUPON!"
1833,byebyegroupon,"August 28, 2018",1,"Customer Service is terrible Groupon is OK, as long as you don‚Äôt have any issues.  Contacting Customer service and getting proper help is a nightmare.  I give up.  We are done with it.  I bought some activities that were unusable because no availability ever.  then I had to trade in my vouchers.  I did not get full value, and the trad-in was a big hassle, made worse by chatting with customer service, who could have easily traded the vouchers in for me.  There was much more, but getting to Chat is not even straight-forward, and there is no phone number.  Best of luck!"

I‚Äôm going to Vegas, got a great deal on a gorgeous hotel, and to see Real Bodies, something I have wanted to see for many years and finally get to see it much cheaper.

1835,Ruggeg,"November 23, 2018",5,Great deals/pricing I have always been an ebay/amazon guy but I this last year I have purchased many items at really great prices AFTER comparing to ebay/amazon.

1836,Missie bug,"November 26, 2018",5,"There‚Äôs something for everyone. Groupon always has a great deal on goods and services. I have been buying things from Groupon for years and I have very seldom been disappointed. They have a good returns policy, but if you‚Äôre anything like me, you probably won‚Äôt need it. I recommend Groupon to everyone in need of cheap but good items."
1837,KsNo1989,"December 6, 2018",4,Great Selection Shipping costs are too high for how long the wait is.. products are always great though and always looks just as the pictures show which is amazing.. :) but majority of the coupon codes they email you or show on the app never seem to work for anything I purchase.

1839,Jdw one love 54,"December 16, 2018",2,Customer service Unfortunately my latest experience with Groupon has been subpar. I have ordered items in multiple and only received partial purchase and Groupon tracking states both items delivered. Followed up with Fedex who validated my claim and now I am lost for reimbursement. The customer needs to have a contact information for Groupon in order to obtain assistance with these issues. I contacted the vendor directly who is now forwarding me to hash out with Groupon. Can someone please assist me with a resolution.

1842,BIrdsup,"April 16, 2018",2,Garbage Groupon customer service is nonexistent. I bought tickets for a comedy show and ran into a small hiccup where my wife needed to change her maiden name. Groupon bounces me off to a ‚Äúmerchant‚Äù since they don‚Äôt deal with it. But the ‚Äúmerchant‚Äù didn‚Äôt take my money. I remember clearly giving my card info to Groupon so they should be addressing issues themselves. Some of the deals might be good but it‚Äôs not worth the risk getting screwed. First time I use Groupon since their lawsuit for shady practices. Obviously they haven‚Äôt learned much.

And then the additional extra savings promotions, make most of the deals feel like steals.  They‚Äôve also become more flexible with exchanging, extending expiration dates, etc. and that has made all of the difference!"
1851,IBLINDY,"February 26, 2020",5,Love Groupon!! So Many Great Deals!! I absolutely love Groupon!!! I get the best deals on here for local events.  I also find great items I have a hard time finding anywhere else.  Groupon is always offering some sort of discount or deal as well so the prices are very reasonable.  I recommend Groupon to all of my friends and family.
1852,H.O.torr.CA,"January 25, 2020",5,"My Best Friend for Planning for a Day with my Kids Amazing deals all the time. This is my favorite go to place when I have no idea how I wanna spend the weekend (or even weekday) with my kids! I get to explore my area, get great deals at the same time and have lots of fun! I even got my kids to start on playing sports (karate & ice skating) through Groupon."
1853,Hua Mom,"January 19, 2020",5,Tammy I appreciate how Groupon has evolved and offers the trade-in for expired Groupon‚Äôs...very inventive!
1854,Clfx83,"November 29, 2019",5,"Best app ever! If you love doing things, but your budget doesn‚Äôt always agree with you, download this app! I can‚Äôt tell you how many amazing experiences I‚Äôve been able to have for a ridiculous price thanks to Groupon. I use it so much, that I got the VIP access at $10 a month and it‚Äôs already paying its self! Love this app!!"
1855,Rudolf_,"October 6, 2019",5,"Great deals (most of the time)      ;-) I started slow using Groupon. But after the first pleasant experiences, I hit the accelerator..."
1856,retired in SD,"October 5, 2019",5,New Experiences I like trying new things by using Groupon. It‚Äôs a great way to try something or place you haven‚Äôt been before. Sometimes once is enough other times we have become regular customers. I also like the savings on group deals to take the whole family.
1857,RoarMom,"September 19, 2019",5,"Great deals/no hassle I love Groupon and always try to check it for great deals before I purchase any service or outing especially.  My husband and I travel a lot and we use them all over during our trips.  The merchants accept them with no hassle so we‚Äôve had great success with using them.  Thanks, Groupon!"
1858,Lenny aüê†,"September 10, 2019",1,Loss of information In the past I had no problems. Now no purchases for the past year shows up. No problem as I have used my groupons. But now my purchase for later this month does not show up. My bank verifies payment to Groupon but Groupon has no record. 
1859,keg50,"August 18, 2019",5,Set of 5 stainless steel mixing bowls with airtight covers Fantastic final prices on items with Groupon Select! And I‚Äôve been needing to buy a good set of mixing bowls for quite some time. The fact that the airtight covers are BPA-free is a big plus and the fact that everything from Groupon is hassle-free to order and arrives in timely fashion makes it a site I return to frequently.
1860,MRO-Mom,"March 30, 2019",4,"Love the occasional good deals and simple return Groupon is filled with valuable nuggets but you have to be patient and selective. I‚Äôve gotten good quality sturdy storage containers on wheels for half the price of retail stores, booked hotel rooms for $60+ less to visit my mom, and went on numerous fun restaurant explorations in and out of town. Not everything listed is a good deal or good quality. Read the reviews and do your homework."
1861,Hal from Searcy,"May 7, 2019",4,"Good value, but.... Many Groupons offer good value, but our past experience has been somewhat variable ‚Äî as in, Groupon apparently does not verify the licensing of the offering businesses nor their competency.  In at least one instance in our previous residence an electrical fault was left undetected and uncorrected, which could have had serious consequences had a specific sequence of failures occurred.  Trust, but verify, right?"
1862,Triple Flipper,"May 20, 2019",5,"Make plans only after checking Groupon After more than 6 years of use, I continue to find interesting activities and terrific eateries through Groupon. Some I wouldn‚Äôt have tried had it not been for the great deals. It‚Äôs the best place to shop for the unexpected things to do with friends."
1863,cmknick,"June 4, 2019",5,Great option to change purchase My young daughter recently bought a Groupon while playing with my phone. The activity was two hours away. I found that I could trade the value for something local. Thanks coupon for making that available!

1865,Honeypel,"August 7, 2019",4,First time user As stated above this is the very first time I have taken  advantage of the Groupon App. Much easier to use than anticipated. I gave it a 4 star rating because I plan to redeem this next week and therefore cannot give a five star rating until next week when this is redeemed. I do not anticipate any problems so after redemption I will give another review. Thank you. Cathy A. Pelletier
1866,Ncxxz,"August 4, 2019",4,A great app Don‚Äôt get me wrong i love the deals groupon has but the refund policy needs to be more re-enforce .... i didn‚Äôt need a groupon i bough because i read it wrong(the oil change was for the wrong car) and i emailed groupon and they didn‚Äôt do nothing about it but an expired timer ??like i can reuse it for the last final hours but i didn‚Äôt need it then i just wanted me $20 back !! overall nice app.
1867,JawBreakerBaby,"August 4, 2019",5,"Great! I‚Äôve saved so much money ! Whether or not it was a good time I ended up having, it sure does beat regular price! 100% and all the times I did have fun with friends was more than worth the discounted price!

1868,Kbarree,"July 29, 2019",5,"Beauty, new places, and adventure I love love love Groupon. It gives me the chance to try new things and plan things I would normally never do because I didn't know about them or they were too expensive. As a single mother I especially love that I can do beautifying things that I normally wouldn't do because of the expense."
1869,krisa Medium,"July 6, 2019",5,Perfect & Convenient I‚Äôve ordered many things from Groupon quick service and delivery but I bought two cars and it takes three people together to put together one kids car it‚Äôs too many parts and a lot of work but everything else I‚Äôve ordered from Groupon was great I love Groupon

I find more unique and fun things on Groupon than anywhere else...things I don‚Äôt even know are available. Then they are at a price that makes me comfortable trying it!

1872,Sunshine FAB,"December 31, 2018",2,"Not Awesome Have purchased two Groupons and wasn‚Äôt able to use the massage with Goddess Cove Holistic three times. First, the Vendor told me I couldn‚Äôt use it within the timeframe provided.  Secondly, I asked from a refund from Groupon which wasn‚Äôt processed.  Thirdly, I scheduled an appointment online only to get a call from the vendor to tell me the masseuse quit and didn‚Äôt have any available to work around my work schedule.  This was such a disappointment considering I wanted this massage for my 45th birthday!  All I want is a full refund."
1873,Phillygirl 1,"January 2, 2019",3,Frustrating website If you look at something and choose not to save it and go back to the list of products you will be back at the top. If you save it and are thinking about it the set up is too easy to make an accidental purchase. When you want to totally clean things up it‚Äôs problematic too. Needless to say I like a lot of the products but hate the site. Also not consistent about discriminations.
1874,Wowza26,"January 25, 2019",5,Tailored Tea Recently spent a most relaxing late lunch with a friend enjoying the warmth and charm of this delightful tea room! Our server Sarah was a delight and Jarad the owner and chief Blessed with his excellent culinary skills. He came out and talked with us about his preparation of our food. We so enjoyed our visit!

1877,Queen Snowflake,"March 8, 2019",4,"Love Groupons Even though I don't live in Tulsa, I do come there once or twice a month. I love that the offers don't expire in a short time frame. This way I get to take advantage of more offers.  I can't always get back to Tulsa before some of the regular stores that offer coupons or specials are expired.  And now Bartlesville newspaper has started the same type of daily offers!"

I am getting dad healthy enough to get his first ever massage, and have piece of mind. Great program Groupon."
1879,jenasaurusrex,"March 14, 2019",3,Had some bad experiences lately I have purchased to experiences recently then when it came time to schedule the vendors had no availability and would not for several months. These type of vendors should be removed. Groupon doesn‚Äôt offer a refund even after one vendor told us they simply couldn‚Äôt accommodate us anytime in the near future. We had to settle with a groupon credit only to be used on another Groupon.
1880,cole157390,"September 14, 2018",5,Great in all aspects Groupon is an easy to navigate and helps to spring up ideas for a vacation. I started out just looking for a deal on a hotel and then it turned out to be that I found awesome things to do while we were there using the app at a great price. When planning things on a budget this app is perfect.
1881,motam23,"September 27, 2018",5,"Best deals! Helps when I‚Äôm on a budget If something ends up expired, they will return my money. After all, IT IS my money.

I never give reviews but they have good deals!"
1882,Skyesmma52,"September 29, 2018",5,"Love Groupon I have been using Groupon for many years now. I‚Äôve seen a lot of savings, especially when buying presents for my teenager.

1883,anahi6,"October 10, 2018",5,Love the savings Groupon is great. I am always able to find deals on things that I use and need. I also buy groupons for places that I want to try that I don‚Äôt want to pay full price on. I have never had any problems claiming any of the vouchers that I have bought. Groupon is also on Ebates so I double the savings!!
1884,Pw53,"November 4, 2018",5,This is a fun way to find great deals without going anywhere! I'm kind of new to this but I've found some really nice things at great prices.

1885,WHHJR,"November 16, 2018",5,"Easy and Fast but do your research! Groupon is a great way to make some really decent purchases for the Holidays without leaving the comforts of home.

1895,mirnarn1,"July 1, 2018",5,PayPal needs to inquire those items sold on the website. I appreciate the notifications and price value of offerings.

Thanks!"
1917,Mandy~D,"September 7, 2019",4,Groupon simplicity I love Groupon for several reasons! The main reason is the Simplicity of using the App. Groupon is great for trying out spa treatments that you‚Äôve been wanting to try but are not in your budget @ the time. They seem to always have what I‚Äôm looking for at an affordable price! I have been purchasing quite a bit lately & I‚Äôm a little bit addicted to Groupon now!

They are a great site that allows you to try a bunch of new things and products for a fair price. My only critique is they don‚Äôt always get what‚Äôs included in your Groupon correct. I have ordered a few things and didn‚Äôt get everything it said that I would.

Very rude and they just take your money and when there‚Äôs a problem you have no one to help fix it. I will not be using Groupon anymore
1926,King Sporte,"June 2, 2019",4,Customer Service Access Most of the time my Groupon purchases have been great.  My concern is when you realize you purchased the wrong product.  Groupon does not have easy access to Customer Service issues.  I have been stuck with purchases that I will not be able to redeem my money back.  This needs to be fixed.

Now, they want you to do everything online with Live Chat, but then there aren‚Äôt any agents available for that either, so make sure you don‚Äôt need to make changes or exchange or return items because you‚Äôll be screwed. Thank God I‚Äôve always gotten the items I‚Äôve ordered when I was supposed to. Buy with caution."
1930,Pearlizumi,"December 14, 2018",5,"Very cool I‚Äôve heard about Groupon for a long time now. I‚Äôve never tried it. I finally got it and gave it a spin. I have to admit that I‚Äôm a fan. There are lots of great offers for places to go, things to do and bobbles to buy. I bought a really nice body scale for a fraction of what it would have been in a brick and mortar store. Again, I am a fan. Thanks!"

They have a plethora of deals and amazing options to choose from. Groupon has entertained me and kept me happily active
1933,bhujhfy,"December 29, 2018",3,Groupon is great Groupon is great and I use it frequently. The only disappointment is when there is a problem. It‚Äôs difficult to find on the site where to contact customer service and then it usually takes several emails to get things done. Each time I have had a problem it was solved; but it took awhile. Still love Groupon.
1934,Tukayi,"January 1, 2019",5,I love Groupon!! I am so grateful to Groupon for getting me the best deals for the money!! I see something I like and I get an alert when it‚Äôs on sale!!

1935,tehune,"January 5, 2019",5,"Yep ü§ì I was a little hesitant to use Groupon, but have become a regular customer and have been pleased with everything I received. The hardest part is the experience buys (especially as a gift), where you do a voucher, and watch for expiration date."
1936,cee Jaylen,"January 18, 2019",5,Extraordinary Items I have found unique items in ladies current fashion wear at unbelievable pricing. But you have to react quickly to secure the item in a timely manner. Blink and you will have buyers remorse. It will be gone!! Never to return !! 
1937,Joanij,"January 31, 2019",5,Great place to shop I have bought restaurant coupons shopped and done vacations with Groupon.  And I love it!  The only part is I wish is that the free returns were a little longer.  I have had a few things that I gave as a gift and would have needed to return.  So I need to make my shopping sooner to the birthdaysüåπ

Thank you Groupon.
1939,Leiahi808,"March 17, 2019",5,Great Products I‚Äôve bought numerous items from Groupon over the years.  I‚Äôve been satisfied with overall service and anytime I‚Äôve had issues with a product/service (rarely) the customer service was easy to work with and my problem was resolved promptly.
1940,customer0301,"August 3, 2018",1,Horrible Experience Since I‚Äôve downloaded the app I made 2 purchases on the same day about an hour apart and all of the promo codes were invalid. I spent at least $55 that can‚Äôt be refunded to me or exchange for other promo codes because they were ‚Äúredeemed.‚Äù I have proof that they were never used and when I went to customer service for help they really didn‚Äôt bother to help me and ended my connection leaving me without the things I have purchased. Horrible customer service and deceiving promotions. Make sure to read the fine print.

1943,r. hanson,"October 3, 2018",1,"Terrible customer service / refund options Groupon has the worst system in the business for customer relations. They have overcharged me twice (did not apply coupons I had) over the past year and there is no option for partial refunds except to completely cancel the order. If they would instate a partial refund system I‚Äôd be slightly happier. They have also done away with their phone support, offering only a callback option (by to get there you have to dig through all the fake ‚Äútext support‚Äù options."
1944,Sourdough Lady,"October 20, 2018",2,"Confusing When you click on the email deal, it takes you to a page which, unless you read at superhuman speed, you will miss. I bought a deal for which I couldn‚Äôt find the entire terms of the purchase until after I bought it, which is irksome. I tried a link to a merchant‚Äôs website, which didn‚Äôt work.

1948,ikoyoto,"December 9, 2018",5,Groupon is awesome The ease of use is incredibly. The prices are reasonable and the products are great quality.

I've use Groupon for everything under the sun,  but with our lives so busy it's often difficult to use the vouchers within the allotted time for the discounted value.

I wish Groupon would send me an up to date list of Groupons I have used and those that I have not.  This way I know that what I paid for deals is still available even if the deal itself expired!

I said but that was free. They said read the fine print. I waited on hold for an hour with nothing positive to happen. So I got charged round of golf plus the 50$ charge that noone knows where it went. I would have come out better to play a way nicer course for the same price.

It‚Äôs the best app. I do recommend always checking the rules of the coupon because some places won‚Äôt let you use it on the weekend. My mistake for not reading thoroughlyüòÖ"
2009,koch18,"January 20, 2019",5,Quick and great service I‚Äôve taken my car to this location a few times and they‚Äôre always incredibly friendly and get the job done in a timely matter. We will continue to go to this location with or without a Groupon
2010,Louie The Lug,"April 24, 2018",5,Groupon Rates Right Groupon is very beneficial when you find the right deal for you. I‚Äôve seen deals that are amazing.  I‚Äôve seen deals that are so~so. You just have to scroll through the Groupon website and find a Deal that‚Äôs right for you. Groupon will be here to stay because they always add good deals.
2011,Blackie Chevrolet,"May 29, 2018",5,Buying Mattresses We have purchased two mattresses prior to today‚Äôs purchase of two more mattresses and we have been very pleased with both. Groupon prices are as good or better than most and for these two mattresses the shipping was free. The mattresses are gel foam infused mattresses that allow you to sleep cool at night. Wicks heat away from your body.
2012,Shawna6746,"June 17, 2018",5,"Great specials!! I love the ease of the application. I wish there was an easier way to purchase more than one thing at a time and an easier way to get back to the search page to find more things to purchase. I‚Äôm not extremely computer savvy so maybe it‚Äôs just me. Anyway, the deals are great!!"
2013,Margueritr,"June 21, 2018",3,Change I love Groupon! I just wish there were more changes to the activities and goods. I feel like in Corpus Christi we see the same activity deals over and over. We have plenty of places to go but the same 5 are the only businesses with deal. I also don‚Äôt see ask much change in goods as I used to when I first downloaded the app 2 years ago. I still love groupon! Especially during he holidays :)
2014,NEY1963,"June 29, 2018",5,Exceptional!!! I have been purchasing groupons for several years. To date out of all competitors they are the best from customer service to quality of products sold and I always feel like I get the most for my money. I trust this company and definitely highly recommend them!
2015,Ginger24x7,"June 30, 2018",5,"Love it! I've used the app countless times to get last minute unexpected and unplanned entertainment, food, activities, etc. I even found my favorite masseuse when all I wanted was a last minute massage and now I go there regularly. I've definitely saved a bunch of money with the app and will continue to use it."
2016,ccmemom,"July 5, 2018",5,"Groupon is great I‚Äôve been using Groupon for servers years.  The deals are great, sometimes you don‚Äôt save a ton of money but you get to skip the ticket line at places because you‚Äôll have yours already in your hand.  They have good customer service and are always trying to make things better."
2017,Staceyann's Mommy,"July 9, 2018",5,A Great Deal On An Excellent Service. This Groupon from Apple Music allows the purchaser to access over 45 million songs for four months fee free. 
2018,h0gheaven,"July 17, 2018",5,I‚Äôm obsessed as my daughter would tell me. A year ago I had my doubts about any online shopping. I‚Äôm the first to admit I‚Äôm not very Tech Saavy. Thanks to the easy way groupon is to use...Now I shop online all the time. I‚Äôm not really sure if that is a good thing at times. Although I do love the ease of groupon compared to other online sellers.
2019,terisabi,"July 22, 2018",4,Really good deals! Fast delivery I left the 5th star off because I‚Äôve seen Benefit POREfessional on there for way more than it cost to buy it at Sephora. Seeing that price and knowing the actual price made me google everything before I purchase from Groupon. The Benefit product has been removed which makes feel great like they are catching the mistakes quickly. I do love Groupon
2020,Yozmonster,"February 8, 2018",5,"My new addiction! The only disappointment I have is that I only discovered this now! I have saved so much money on so many different skin treatments , procedures, and gifts that it has actually improved my overall quality of life. Thank you Groupon as well as all participating locations for making this girl VERY happy!"
2021,Jaycorp05,"February 11, 2018",1,"Glitches improper orders Lets be honest we all are looking for great deals on line.  Some of us are even willing to sacrifice quality, customer service and even a normal base line experience.  I am frugal and have been a victim of my own doing buy subjecting myself to groupon‚Äôs horrible practices. I have now made more unsatisfying purchases then then ones that have actually made me in anyway happy. If your looking for low quality items, an app that glitches all the time and absurd customer service team and policy then Groupon is the place for you"
2022,FLGIRLGRITS53,"February 19, 2018",5,"Fan of Groupon I‚Äôve been using Groupon for about 3 years. I‚Äôve bought facials, massages, tanning, restaurants, teeth whitening kits and multi other items. I‚Äôve never been disappointed. You‚Äôll love trying new places and services.

2023,Vampire12,"March 4, 2018",5,"Love to Groupon I always enjoy seeing the variety of items available, it has given our family the opportunity to try items we‚Äôve wanted to but not willing to pay full price Incase it wasn‚Äôt as good as we thought.  All our items have been wonderful!"
2024,SLOISIT,"March 11, 2018",5,Becoming more fun than Costco I have only been ordering from Groupon a few months and several items were gifts but I‚Äôm quite impressed with the prices and the quality of everything I‚Äôve received. I just ordered 3 tunics‚Äîthe first items of clothing‚ÄîI‚Äôm anxious to give a good rating. This is good exposure for entrepreneurs üëç
2025,redfreaka,"March 24, 2018",4,"Annoyed I am just frustrated with purchases sometimes because where it says you can buy one Nd then purchase two additional as gifts, it doesn't let you purchase the extra ones that I cant tell. I have tried multiple times to purchase an extra as gift and it says there aren't enough every time. "
2026,Kimcansew,"March 25, 2018",5,Great App! Im loving this app. It‚Äôs easy to navigate and I‚Äôve used it many times to get great deals on everything from glass blowing classes to sheets. I literally check on this app first before I buy anything. I‚Äôve saved a ton of money and been satisfied with every purchase I‚Äôve made. Great variety and good quality merchandise. Thank you!!!
2027,Lena263,"March 31, 2018",4,"4 Stars Groupon is on point with providing good deals, but they can‚Äôt control the manufacturing and delivery of the product. I‚Äôve experienced a couple of episodes where I ordered 5 of an item and only receive 3. Groupon offered a full refund, but it was for multiple people and I needed at least the 3 I received. Also, the product get to the consumer in a timely manner."
2028,Da Kang!!,"April 3, 2018",5,Call me Mr. Groupon I enjoy the deals. Living in the D.C. area can get quite expensive. There are a lot of great deals especially when I have out of town guest. From dining to things to do in the area. Family and friends have great time. And we save money. Even use when leave the area. Plan ahead and know I‚Äôm getting a great deal.
2029,Vipers26,"April 14, 2018",5,"Awesome app! I was able to find an item that I was unable to find locally at any of the stores here in my town. Just blown away how easy the app is to use, just type in the search bar what you are looking for and boom, found it. I'm just waiting now for the delivery, to make sure it was what I ordered."
2030,Unhappy055,"April 2, 2020",1,Terrible Assistance from chat During the trying times of COVID19 I had an order that was delivered to the wrong address and another order that was due for delivery and could not get any assistance. Finally after trying several times I was told to contact fedex to change the address. Fedex policy is that only the shipper can make those changes. Going back to chat no one would answer my concerns $200 and something dollars wasted. I was very very unhappy with this on top of chat disconnected me in the middle of trying to get resolution
2031,Hahmed9910,"January 30, 2020",5,"Excellent App and Service Groupon Customer Service is excellent, whether on the phone or with a chat feature."

2033,Sassiear50,"January 25, 2020",5,"Love me some Groupon Never never had a bad deal that wasn't my fault! I get in a hurry and don't read all the rules. My bad! Have used Groupon so many times! Never been disappointed when I ready the description correctly . Great massages ! Enjoyed many restaurants, oil changes , shows. Highly recommend !"
2034,Mama Bear t-shirt,"December 20, 2019",5,"Mascara I love this mascara. I am 65 and have used many, many different kinds of mascara. Every time I go out people stop me and ask, ‚Äòare those your real lashes‚Äô so gals this mascara makes your lashes so long and full that people think your lashes are false extensions. You will be happy with the results. I‚Äôm re-ordering today for a friend. Happy Lashes !!üòçüòä"
2035,FoundSuccessAtLast,"December 9, 2019",2,Needs to be more user friendly It is difficult for me to go back and track what I paid for a purchase. Why doesn‚Äôt a receipt come with a purchase?  When there‚Äôs a charge on my credit card there‚Äôs no easy way to trace the amount of the purchase from ‚ÄúMy Stuff‚Äù on the app. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating and discourages me from wanting to do business with Groupon. Shipping costs diminish the ‚Äúgreat deal‚Äù you‚Äôre offering. Merchandise quality is often substandard.
2036,cheysoldo,"November 24, 2019",5,"Yes I really enjoy using Groupon to find deals in my area, or using it when I go out of town, it‚Äôs a great way to find restaurants and deals on spas and massages. I have used Groupon for personalized items and they were very much enjoyed. Also with Groupon select I get even more money off which is great! Thank you!."
2037,CruiseAddicted,"November 17, 2019",5,"Great app!! I love using Groupon on many local deals at wineries, breweries, and distilleries, that I would otherwise not even know about. I also  like the wine choices that ship right to my house, most without shipping charges! I check my app everyday and watch for great percentage-off deals. Couldn‚Äôt live without my Groupon!!"
2038,Flyer188,"November 4, 2019",5,Easy and simple Easy and quick way to shop and buy items. Most have pretty good descriptions and some have ratings. The ratings might not have text but the star system is better than nothing. I will not buy a product that doesn‚Äôt have a rating.
2039,ProudNavyMomBHC,"October 26, 2019",5,"Great Products!! Great Value!! I have ordered several things from Groupon including massage therapy, personalized wood products, personalized puzzles, no matter what the item the Merchant Never disappoints!!

2041,Mjv12916,"October 16, 2019",5,Love love love love it!!! Enough said! Where else can you save more on already slashed prices! I have bought a little bit of everything from Groupon and can‚Äôt imagine life without it now. I joke to my friends and family that I‚Äôll never pay full price for anything ever again. Thanks Groupon!
2042,Mishlz1,"October 12, 2019",2,"Sale codes rarely work I always seem to have a problem with the sale codes. They appear at check out, but when the final payment goes through, the price changes and the coupon is gone. When I contact customer service they have no explanation and give me a credit, that does me no good on my purchase and I have to buy something else to use it. What a scam. Also, shipping takes forever. Time to unsubscribe from their 20 emails a day."
2043,SouthHodge,"October 5, 2019",5,"Great Deals I have been using Groupon for a while now, over a year. I have had two problems both were resolved by Groupon very nicely. I found them to be very fair and I think it's very worth using."
2044,A. Parks2,"September 23, 2019",5,"Save $$$ when you travel! Whenever I‚Äôm going out of town, I always put the location of where I‚Äôm going into Groupon.

Once I get to the airport I save money on parking using a Groupon too. I love it!"
2045,jackkikay!,"September 11, 2019",5,"Great deals I can always find a great deal no matter what the need. It could be a get away, night out, something to pamper myself or even a personalized gift.

2050,Letty MG,"April 10, 2019",5,LOVE IT! I love the Groupon App.  A great place to find great services at an amazing price!  I have enjoyed many different services for less than half the price.  I have no regrets about any of them.  In fact I keep going back to the same place and some of them even honor the Groupon price after the first visit.  It‚Äôs been wonderful.
2051,swtblng,"April 14, 2019",5,"Groupon This is an awesome place to find the greatest deals.

2053,joe denk,"May 2, 2019",1,Issues Simple ticks purchase became a nightmare. Long story short tried to buy tickets for myself and my wife. Some reason I showed that I tried to purchase 3 duplicate tickets then requested the Groupon to call me and first call I wasn‚Äôt able to hear anything and told him to call back barely heard him saying ok but never called back. I requested another call and she said I understand your issue and I‚Äôm gonna escalate this to upper case manager and wait on the line. I waited for 8 minutes no one answered and then cal got dropped. Horrible service!!
2054,kmciv,"May 7, 2019",2,"Groupon Select Scam I was prompted to enroll in Groupon Select for 6 months to receive an additional 25% off my order.  I was purchasing skydiving vouchers and it seemed like a good deal. I enrolled and it sent me to review my order. It took off $29 off of a $238 order, that is not 25%. I then attempted the ‚Äúlive chat‚Äù to resolve the issue and conveniently no one was available and the option for assistance disappeared. I wouldn‚Äôt have agreed to enroll in the Groupon select had I known it wasn‚Äôt actually 25% off. Very disappointed."

2056,Lisaindividual,"May 31, 2019",5,What Savings! This has been a great app to use to save tons of money. Thanks to Groupon we can spend our family nights doing what we really want to do rather than what we could only afford. Thanks for the savings! The app is easy to use and allows Pay Pal making it convenient and safe! üòäüòäüòä
2057,Chigadera,"June 5, 2019",1,Chingadera So upset I‚Äôm now buying the 5 option voucher for the 2nd time hoping Groupon will respond to my email since apparently seems to be the only way to get customer support. My family and I wanted to do the 5 attraction pass so I‚Äôm
2058,Biochemical wizard,"June 16, 2019",4,"Better than no deals but wish there was a better variety Lately some of the deals such as T-shirt‚Äôs and vacations are a ripoff, I would like to see better selectivity from Groupon. Just because a client is willing to put stuff on your site doesn‚Äôt mean that Groupon should allow it. Quality over quantity please. I‚Äôd like to see you kick it up a notch."
2059,MamaBear2427,"June 15, 2019",5,Love forever and ever I‚Äôve been doing Groupon for years now. And somehow they always having great deals to places that I‚Äôm like they kinda pricey so I hold off and than Groupon is like calling for me to try it. Whenever theirs something I look on here first. Stay being great and hey more coupons would be always welcomed. ;)
2060,lonluv4,"January 23, 2019",4,"Great last minute deals I love having the many choices to choose from before purchasing and or shopping. It‚Äôs like window shopping without leaving home and the discounts are coupons, without cutting or clipping. "

2067,marci-mae,"March 9, 2019",3,What has happened to customer service? Love the deals but difficult to contact when there is an issue.  They offered to give me a groupon credit for the $50 worth of product that never arrived but I had to ask for an additional $5 for the inconvenience.  A company with good customer service would have automatically offered that to a customer that had been inconvenienced
2068,mljbod,"March 17, 2019",4,"Ok Experience this time Every time I use groupon I have a great experience, however, this time when trying to update/remove old addresses there was no straight forward way to do so.

2070,the giant hen,"October 7, 2018",1,"Sign-up process It is a pain in the neck trying to sign up as a new customer of Groupon. Is it just because I am in the backwater of the  Albuquerque hinterlands or is it your ‚ÄúUSER UNFRIENDLY‚Äù system? I have been trying for 2 days to enter cc info. Everything else, name, email, address went through but no form for the cc# so I was unable to buy the service I wanted yesterday. Strange system you have. Finally, tonight, a pop up announced that I needed to enter my cc#. I may not last long as your customer. Hopefully the product I bought will amend that."
2071,Hardworkin13,"November 2, 2018",5,"Not pushy and great service I have used Groupon now for about 3 years. I love it because it offers me deals at locations that I would never had tried.

God bless the USA!!!"

2073,cawa12345,"November 4, 2018",1,"Poor customer service I had a lot of difficulty getting this order to do through. There was a problem with processing my credit card. It felt nearly impossible to get customer service‚Äî- from my first request to the time that I got any response a week had passed. Then, the response came in the form of an email giving me instructions to respond. I then had to wait approximately 18 hours for a response to the email that I returned. There has got to be a more customer friendly way to do business."

Been dealing with costumer support for the last 4 hours trying to get the other $250 back. They‚Äôre being rude, giving us attitude, making us wait and jump thru hoops to get our money back. Even if we get the double charge refunded we still spent 4+ hours of our time dealing with this. Pathetic excuse of costumer support and a glitchy app that charged us $500 instead of $250. "

2081,ddjirbkuf,"May 12, 2018",3,So difficult to get in touch with customer service The website and app are so slow.  The orders show up as failed and then you find that you ended up buying a bunch of the same groupons.  Then to get in touch with customer service and explain the situation is practically impossible.  I bought a Groupon and when I went to the site to redeem the product is sold out.  Very annoying
2082,misskitty!,"May 20, 2018",4,Good Job I have used Groupon for years with ease. Today I had a problem with a site and my order was in error. Unfortunately it was an ‚Äúall sales final‚Äù purchase.

I am thoroughly satisfied with Groupon and will continue to use them with confidence.
2083,Kathy4Girls,"July 1, 2018",5,Shady They want credit card information even though you are not using a credit card. Why give gift cards when you have to give them all of your information and credit card easy for hackers to get your information.

2087,Binks and Dora,"August 27, 2018",5,"Tailored tea We love doing brunch or lunch at Tailored Tea. The tea variety is always excellent, and the brewed tea is first rate. We have tried many different food selections from the menu and are never disappointed. The scones are some of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. The restaurant, in what was once an older homestead, is very unique. If you can take the time to enjoy it, it‚Äôs worth a visit."
2088,lynnüëå,"September 16, 2018",5,Lynn Groupon offers exciting and useful products and services. Some are at super discounts and give you an opportunity to try new things that otherwise you might never have due to the high prices. They offer lower prices for things that you have interest in or want to give as gifts
2089,Squashhead,"September 25, 2018",5,"Deals! but be careful There are some awesome deals on here! Just be careful because many companies list things at full price, or even greater than what an item is sold at most other places. They are able to trick people because people assume that just because it‚Äôs on Groupon, it must mean it‚Äôs a good deal."
2090,Binkikay,"February 8, 2018",5,"Great deals with Groupon! We really enjoy the deals on Groupon. We have purchased outstanding trips & products on this sight.

2091,The Selfcare Specialist,"April 14, 2018",5,"Best prices for top quality services and merchandise. So far, I have bought from Groupon several times.

I hadn‚Äôt purchased anything for a few years that is not intangible; well... how tough does it have to be to change a physical address on this platform? Geez, I had to go in three times and hope I wasn‚Äôt billed twice! The billing address is changed: we should just have an option to change the shipping address, and vice versa! Love the deals, so just constructive criticism here! Thanks :-)."

2097,Cindy Lou Rae,"January 31, 2020",1,Refund was a huge hassle. Hopefully you won‚Äôt need one If you need  a refund it‚Äôs a big hassle. Website will redirect you in a circle and then if you do get it resolved you could an email a day later saying it they were not able to refund your purchase but you could apply it to a purchase Equal to or more than that price. No refund granted. That was my experience and it was frustrating. When it works it works wonderfully. Just bad procedures and only contact was with an email never a live person.
2098,A_Like_It,"January 24, 2020",4,Great Savings Groupon is an awesome way to get what you need or want for less. Always read the details and fine print from the sellers. I usually get exactly what I want. Not a fan of booking rooms/trips because there are a lot of extra fees. Not as much food deals as there used to be. You can get cash back from going to restaurants now but not the same.

2101,Qwerty6914,"January 17, 2020",2,"Groupon Overall, there are some good deals. However, many ‚Äòdeals‚Äô will appear in your searches that are from different cities than where you searched. Read details carefully. For example, I searched for ‚ÄòPhiladelphia airport parking‚Äô, and received results for airport parking deals in NY, Chicago, and others. Very easy to mistakenly purchase something you can‚Äôt use. They also make returns/refunds difficult, making you wonder if they purposely include results from the wrong area."

There is no direct line to call and even wait in a que to speak to someone. All communication take place through email or where they state they have 24/7 customer support and chat but is impossible to find in the app. I‚Äôve been over a month now trying to get an issue resolved and it is impossible. At this point I‚Äôll most likely be out $600. If I could rate lower I would...
2109,rattlehead09876,"November 4, 2019",1,"Worst experience ever Whole function of the app is to sell you services in your area. Searched for Halloween horror park tickets in my area Orlando using  the app. Was sold tickets for California which was not clearly stated, and they refuse to refund. Support was awful chatted right after purchasing and was told they cant refund and they opened a escalation. Took three days to hear back and now I am stuck with expired useless tickets for something across the continent. Thanks I will never use Groupon again. Waste of time and money because of their faulty app."

2118,Angie WJ,"July 14, 2019",5,Great service for online shopping I have used Groupon for several orders and currently have two orders pending.

2119,emailinator,"July 14, 2019",5,"Ruined Meüòú What Groupon has really done for me, is show me that I do actually in deed pay more for a lot of stuff that I need to.

2120,Realtor Carolyn,"March 24, 2019",4,"Love the great bargains! I love the bargains I get on Groupon. The only reason I would rate it a 4instead of 5, is that sometimes you have to go through a process to get your items instead of just ordering and having them directly shipped, such as going to a website etc. When you go through a third-party you don‚Äôt always get customer satisfaction."

2127,MoConns,"July 8, 2019",1,"Groupon has become a complete scam My experience with Groupon was originally great, but over the last year has become horrible. They are subscribing merchants that can‚Äôt deliver.  The app doesn‚Äôt work the way it‚Äôs supposed to or per the policy for trade ins. When you try to chat with someone they are completely rude and won‚Äôt address any questions or issues with vendors honoring Groupon offers as they have in the past. I‚Äôm done and once I finish using my last remaining Groupons I‚Äôm done with this app and service. They have lost all credibility."

That being said after spending over two full days reading reviews etc at random from differing types of service and products. It is my opinion that if you have a negative experience with groupon,it‚Äôs probably due to not having read COMPLETELY or not understanding the whole ad."

2144,Mthirst,"September 14, 2018",5,Great been using it for 2-3 years now I love it. Only thing a lot of orders require you to purchase before you see the date availability.

2162,Shopping4ginger,"April 2, 2018",4,"Groupon review I have had very good results in purchasing products and services from here. Most of the time returning items has been easy. However, if you have more than 1 return it's best to not return them together unless you take the packages to the post office and keep the tracking numbers until all your monies have been refunded."
2163,Drod1972,"April 5, 2018",5,Great Date Night Deals Love Groupon.  A great way to discover new restaurants you would never think of trying and every once in a while you run into an extraordinary place.

2166,Goku Gonzalez,"March 10, 2020",5,Great way to save money I love that there is always a discount on an activity that you normally wouldn‚Äôt think about trying.

2167,Engi-Lish,"March 5, 2020",1,"System constantly broken I paid for a skin care voucher recently, I‚Äôm infuriated to find the entire thing VANISHED. I tried talking to someone about it in the customer service section and guess what? Couldn‚Äôt even send the thing because systems are DOWN. Yet I look at my chase account and it was still charged. I don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt workin? I paid the money, the voucher I bought doesn‚Äôt expire until MONTHS from now. So what happens to my money? Is it just gone? Forget this app. Forget groupon. Thoroughly unprofessional and shady."
2168,Shuggy_Test,"February 23, 2020",1,Does not work fully with VoiceOver This app only works partially for blind users. Not all aspects of the app are readable or even selectable with VO turned on including the ability to BUY! That means a blind user has to have the assistance of someone sighted in order to select Buy and VO has to be turned off in order for the selection to be made. Then there is absolutely no support option to even let someone know about the issue. So hopefully someone at Groupon reads these reviews and they will see the need to fix these issues.

With Groupon you can get some sickkk local deals and it‚Äôs also a great way check out different services in your city you wouldn‚Äôt have known of otherwise.

First I couldn‚Äôt get my gift cards to work, then I contacted customer support to understand how the cards worked.  I got nothing that helped.  I used the FAQ to understand.  Then I make my my selections, and for nearly three days, your servers went down.  I couldn‚Äôt set up a payment to complete the transaction.  I just now tried and got it to accept a credit card that I would have rather not used, only to not get the original deal on one of the items."

All our fun activities are bought here @ Groupon from Clippers tickets in Staples center, Ulimate Variety show and magic shows in Las Vegas, from our favorite restaurants in Los Angeles, whenever we go out, Groupon is a money-saver. Groupon always discounts the price lower dramatically."

More people should take advantage of their services and good prices."

2208,MICHELLELBT,"March 8, 2019",3,Just okay Some items are great and come when your told and others are so hard to get that I have let about 3-6 just expire because customer service wouldn‚Äôt help me. When I called for an item that I had purchased but wasn‚Äôt showing to redeem they refunded it but wouldn‚Äôt let me repurchase it because they said it was invite only and I had the invite. So far it‚Äôs hit or miss with Groupon.

2231,Davie1560,"February 19, 2018",1,Products bought review The products I‚Äôve bought so far are inferior to products I‚Äôve purchased from retailers.  The strike through prices they claim these items supposedly be sold for if you paid retail is an absolute lie.  The products I‚Äôve purchased have either been trash or I ended up having to give them away because the sizing on the garments are not correct.  Buyers should be aware that these products are not top of the line but maybe throw aways from manufacturers because they couldn‚Äôt market them to retailers.

I‚Äôve also experienced a lot of issues with timely delivery or no delivery, bait and switch by merchants, etc. if you‚Äôre willing to take the risk you can find some good deals. I‚Äôve never lost money but you have to spend time filing complaints or doing returns. If Groupon was reliable and convenient I would shop a lot more here."

The front desk said‚Äù we don‚Äôt know why Groupon continues to do this‚Äù  they offer a option for weekend amount but all the weekends are blacked out ... not booked up. Just blacked out. Shouldn‚Äôt have to read so deep in fine print and truthfully you shouldn‚Äôt offer an option that was NEVER available. The lady even said if I was to have booked the 4th option they would not have honored it. Great your passing along deals but maybe pay attention to your product disclosures

I have already lost a few hundred dollars thanks to these policy‚Äôs and am officially done using this ridiculous app! Rather pay full price instead of dealing with the hassle of a third party company that can‚Äôt even provide customer service help other than Q and A online. I‚Äôll bite the over 300$ I‚Äôve lost not using my Groupon right away and later learning a service was not for me before it expired. The true lost is my business! ‚úåüèΩ

I spoke with him about a refund that I was told I would get and he did not help me at all. I asked is there a wait I could speak to a manager above him and he completely blew me off telling me there is no manager above him, which is a lie because every business has a manager above them. Then when I asked can he connect me with a manager above him, he told me he cannot do that and then hung up on my face. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never want to use them again."

2342,Foot Courier,"September 21, 2019",4,"Great Resource For the most part, my experience with Groupon has been excellent.  My only criticism is that if you encounter a problem that requires contacting them directly, then you end up with a second problem because customer support is non existent or very difficult to reach.  Other than that, it‚Äôs a great way to try out new adventures."
2343,CAC5852,"September 21, 2019",5,Groupon Just love the variety they offer and we‚Äôve done lots of shows for an affordable night out!  And found great new restaurants that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone to if I hadn‚Äôt purchased the Groupon to try it out! The travel is also a great value as well!!!  Just did a fantastic vacation to Bermuda!!
2344,Cgclear,"September 16, 2019",5,"Groupon Great app which has provided some very good quality purchases, prompt delivery, and very good customer service.  Even returns are easily handled.  Good job Groupon!!  Shop, pay, receive, repeatüòä"
2345,Jo Moma 2,"September 15, 2019",4,"Frustration Only had trouble once. Somehow my entire information on my Groupon app was gone including money from expired Groupons that I was not able to use. I was not worried about the money, all I wanted was for them to give my account back. It took multiple emails to finally get the app back. I really enjoy using the app and saving money!"
2346,Mars4324,"September 11, 2019",5,"Love This is such a great app for cheap tickets to concerts, events and products! You‚Äôll save a lot of money plus every time you buy something you get paid back from what I understand. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but i still definitely recommend this app. It‚Äôs great for traveling too!"
2347,primping place,"September 4, 2019",5,"Love that they offered a credit from expired vouchers now! We‚Äôve all done it, you buy something you think is a great idea- and then it expires. This happened with the bowling deal& I just received a message that I could trade in the value toward something else! Great new feature- I am a fan!"
2348,Liz_1018,"August 18, 2019",5,"Not letting me clear notifications I absolutely love Groupon, however for almost 2 weeks now, it won‚Äôt let me clear notifications and I‚Äôm not sure why. I‚Äôm the type that goes through and clears all notifications so it‚Äôs just more weird than anything. Thanks!"
2349,Lion Fantasy,"August 15, 2019",5,"Groupon is a great value. It's always worth while to see what discounts are available with Groupon. You may find something completely different from what you were thinking of at half price, or you may find exactly the deal for you. I love the massage discounts!!"
2350,Brindism,"June 8, 2019",5,Best summer app ever! I am trying to keep my kids busy and having fun but also learning this summer. The deals on entertainment and food are amazing but there are deals on other things like museums as well. I could not be more pleased with the variety of things in our little rural area! This app is the best.
2351,MimiCme,"August 11, 2019",4,Variety I like the great deals with items I can really use. I have been shopping for years with Groupon and I have only had a couple of items that didn‚Äôt quite fulfill my expectations.  It is a great site with so many items to choose from that I lose track of time looking through everything.
2352,JoyinColorado,"July 29, 2019",5,Nice way to become familiar in a new city We recently moved to Charlotte and have been trying to become familiar w good eating spots.

Thank you!
2353,Mrs.TakenCareOfBuisness,"July 25, 2019",5,"Awesomeness It‚Äôs so hard trying to find things to do for date night or friends night when your busy at work.

2354,A McMannis,"July 24, 2019",5,"Some awesome deals I have found some amazing deals on Groupon. If you know what you‚Äôre looking for and you know the products, you can buy without feeling like you‚Äôre taking a risk. I love, love, love the photo books.

They have always been very helpful and they always get my order to me in a timely fashion.  Great customer experience with wonderful staff. Thanks for all the wonderful updates on the latest items and the wonderful discounts!!
2357,D & P in Fort Mill,"June 26, 2019",4,"Great experience Great deals on goods and services, groupons easy to access.  My only complaint is that high reviews are listed first. My 2 star review dropped way down the list and after our experience, we questioned how there could be soooo many 5 star reviews of the Groupon venue we purchased and rated. Best to check out reviews outside of the Groupon site."
2358,Ebaybea,"June 25, 2019",4,Bring back customer service phone! I like Groupon I get a Lotta good deals on it. I really prefer talking to someone on the phone. I remember when Groupon first came out they had really funny recordings when you called and was put on hold and the people are really great. Now it‚Äôs hard to get that you have to chat or email! bring back the phone!
2359,Florida Sunshine1,"June 16, 2019",5,Great deals Love the option to enjoy favorites with a special deal or to explore new activities without a huge investment. I‚Äôve never been disappointed by Groupon even when the new activity turns out not to be a fav. At least I got to try something new at a bargain price.
2360,Lank K F,"February 16, 2019",5,"I love using Groupon as a search engine I love Groupon because I hate trying to search all over for places that do the services I need.  It‚Äôs so much easier to just find a Groupon and go, and it‚Äôs usually to an area I would never have known about and fall in love.  And find somewhere new to explore."
2361,YLandie,"March 10, 2019",5,"Everything possible Prices on everything from treats, games, clothing, entertainment it all here. All the things you can get for your money. This just takes spending to another level makes you feel that you are really getting more. Love it!!!!!"
2362,Lyndsey516,"March 15, 2019",5,"Good deals I like Groupon.  The app is easy to use and can be used to find a variety of goods, experiences, and services.  Sometimes the prices still seem a bit high, but they often have additional discounts which helps.  Just don‚Äôt forget to use Groupons before they expire!"
2363,Catwa47,"March 20, 2019",5,Travel I enjoy using Groupon when I travel.  I often check your site before traveling to a location.  I‚Äôve been introduced to new businesses that I would not have been aware. Its either word of mouth or researching 
2364,Young Treasure 61,"March 27, 2019",5,"Great App! I enjoy viewing Groupon offers with such great discounts and or reductions on some of the greatest products/services available ina couple of surrounding areas of my hometown.

2367,LF G,"May 17, 2019",5,Groupon Purchases We like Groupon very much . I do wish they would bring back the customer support service they offered in the past !!! It was a huge help to us older folks ! Getting an email response is often difficult. The variety of events and goods are so much fun !
2368,muzk girl,"May 29, 2019",1,"Business closed before I could redeem my vouchers I found it really difficult to get customer support regarding a restaurant that has closed and I own two vouchers for it. I had to dig really deep in the app to find a way to get a message through about this and I‚Äôm not confident that they received an email that I tried to write. Although we‚Äôre suppose to be able to cancel a voucher within one day of purchasing it, the app would not let me do it. I hope customer support comes through for me on this."
2369,Natkm25,"June 3, 2019",5,"Great app! I really enjoy this app , I have used it from restaurants to fun entertainment and I always come back to buy another experience for affordable price.

2370,rmd9212,"December 1, 2018",5,"Love my Groupon I‚Äôve been a member for years and enjoy being able to look for great deals. Especially local food deals, which have been terrific. I get to try new places and save money doing it. I love that i can trade in Groupons if I didn‚Äôt use it which I have done several times."
2371,Cburt81,"December 4, 2018",5,Love the variety of deals I‚Äôve ordered so many Groupons over the years from local restaurants or attractions to clothing to other products.  Some of the products have taken a while to ship and I guess that depends on who the vendor is but I‚Äôve always been happy with the great deals I get
2372,cdvbn,"December 4, 2018",5,"Very helpful Just ordered a groupon for an event and I ordered the wrong day. Even though website for canceling is a little hard to navigate, I did get to email chat with customer service and they promptly refunded my order. I was then able to order the right date."
2373,dfirks,"December 9, 2018",5,"Groupon Groupie I‚Äôve purchased a few items from Groupon and let me just say that I am hooked, the comforters are beautiful with vibrant colors and they‚Äôve kept the true colors even after every wash.

2374,scarybo,"December 13, 2018",5,"I love Groupon I absolutely love ordering from Groupon!  My orders are always exactly as described on the website. Orders are shipped in a timely manner.  I have ordered at least 3/4 of the presents for my family of three adult children, four grandchildren, and three in-laws that they will receive Christmas. "
2375,Ngarcia2,"December 18, 2018",5,"All items I truly enjoy shopping through Groupon, it is fun just to see all the bargains. The only thing I recommend is that if you have the place an appointment I will confirm the appointment first before purchasing. So you don't have to have a return because of the long wait"
2376,CBJ1995,"December 20, 2018",1,"Fraudulent Charge Previously I was a supporter of Groupon services and products. However in December I had a fraudulent charge on my account that Groupon refused to acknowledge. I have submitted three requests asking for resolution and additional information to file with my bank but Groupon will not respond and has continually sent me back to submit another request, thus starting the process over again. I would say buyer beware on certain purchases as their customer service is unprofessional and not willing to assist it‚Äôs customers."
2377,Beachsuner,"December 23, 2018",5,Customer Always Satisfied Groupon is a company you can trust. I can buy services and products knowing Groupon will back me if there is a concern. Whenever Groupon offers additional discounts it is a great time to take advantage of savings as I have never experienced a concern that was not handled in a timely manner w/o delayed refund.
2378,StrongLeo70,"January 11, 2019",5,"I love good deals!!! Through Groupon I can test out services like massages, pedis/manis, new places to eat and have fun without feeling like I wasted a lot of money trying it.

2379,The Sampsell,"January 31, 2019",5,"Highly recommend I recently downloaded groupon. I love this app. Once you save your payment info, it becomes extremely fast and easy to make orders. The products/deals are really random (everything from fancy dinners to dildos lol) but over all, I highly recommend this to anyone!"
2380,Paula Tag,"September 29, 2018",5,"Superb offers & Customer Service I have ordered many items and services through Groupon.  I have yet to be disappointed, with the quality of a service or when I‚Äôve placed an order in error, the customer service is very receptive and easy to work with"
2381,AMarcellette,"September 30, 2018",5,Easy to use Groupon has a variety of things that have interest of me in the past couple years of me using the application. It‚Äôs easy and convenient to search and the app notifies me whenever a previous purchased is expired for me to continue to partake in another Groupon‚Äôs near me.
2382,Newfreeedom1,"October 6, 2018",5,"My Favorite Way to Try New Places and Experiences It‚Äôs always worth a shot just to try something out. If you don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs usually only half price so not so bad to take the chance. We have found some awesome places through Groupon that we return to again and again!"
2383,sopavbe,"October 6, 2018",5,"Definitely comes in handy I‚Äôm a full time college student who has to save money! So when I want to go out and save, it helps save a few dollar bills. I would just recommend that before you buy a groupon, you call to see if they accept the coupon"
2384,Michelle from Labelle,"November 6, 2018",5,Great Family Fun I've been with Groupon well over 15 years. From my son's first haircut to amazing 1-2 day trips. Groupon has everything.

Thanks Groupon! Keep Rocking!
2386,City Coastal,"November 12, 2018",5,Excellent - Don‚Äôt Be a Snob - Groupon I‚Äôve used Groupon for years. From swim lessons to products I‚Äôve run the table and each experience except for the restaurant Strega in Boston has been perfect. Strega refused to honor the Groupon and Groupon did nothing about it. Other than that it would have received 5 stars. 
2387,Taz4cali,"November 13, 2018",5,"Groupon Is Life I honestly am obsessed with this app. I get everything from family photos to earphones to the best deals on food.

2389,Beachmm,"November 23, 2018",3,"Overall great savings... I like Groupon except if I need customer service. It‚Äôs hard to get a refund or talk with someone live who can help you with an unordinary question. So unless you have the patience to deal with a virtual assistant, which is truly a pain if you don't have WiFi or service during the time you use your voucher.  If don‚Äôt mind a complicated process when needed customer care this app is great."

2391,Team Chesh,"July 13, 2018",3,"Its ok most of the time I often use this app on my phone and sometimes when I purchase things the system doesn't recognize it and doesn't alert me that it is not recognized. I typically find out after a couple days because nothing has arrived in the mail. When I check the tracking, I see that it was never ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù. This happens too often. Whats up?"
2392,Fubis80,"July 17, 2018",4,Good deals Great to find some deals you‚Äôre looking for and even a water park or hotel for a weekend getaway. Only complaint is notifications lie almost always. It‚Äôll say such and such item you‚Äôre interested in is 20% cheaper then yesterday. Just to get you to go back in and it never is. Otherwise I‚Äôd give it 5 stars but those lies tick me off.
2393,Cathy Gramling,"July 20, 2018",3,"Mrs. Cathy Gramling For most of the products I have bought, I have been completely satisfied.  Delivery is always earlier than expected, and the products have been excellent.  However, I had ordered a Fitbit for my husband along with a 2-year replacement warranty.  The Fitbit stopped working and I am still waiting for a replacement, or even a reply from CPS for over a month.  This situation is extremely disappointing!"

2395,Rayan5b4,"August 8, 2018",5,Grpupon Rocks! I have been using Groupon since they first started and were competing with another app. I have always found the service to be excellent and when something comes and it has not been represented well they will reimburse with no problem. Keep up the great work Groupon!
2396,Quigby,"August 21, 2018",4,Everything under the sun Groupon has become a one stop shopping vehicle. Groupon has allowed a variety of discounts On a nun limited selection.

2404,Jfs,"April 24, 2018",5,"Love getting deals I have gone more shows and done more adventures since using Groupon. Also I have purchased and ordered custom wedding and Christmas gifts.

2405,Jaimeir,"May 11, 2018",2,"‚ÄúCustomer service‚Äù field is a joke It doesn‚Äôt connect to customer service at all. Tried to use the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù feature in the app, and it wiped out my purchased Groupon, and instead of an exchange, charged my credit card for twice the amount of the groupon I selected. I thought the idea was to save money but because the app is so buggy, you‚Äôll just throw money away. Deleting this from my phone as soon as I use the groupons I just wasted money on."
2406,S Turner,"June 4, 2018",5,"Great Savings & Super Easy To Use App Took me a while to fully realize just how great Groupon really was. The app makes it even easier to use than Desktop version.

2411,GGBklyn,"February 24, 2018",5,Great deals Groupon has great deals. I use it all the time. When they have the 20% off specials it‚Äôs especially great. My only problem is with their customer service live chat.  But it‚Äôs getting better. It‚Äôs also great that they let you extend a voucher‚Äôs expiration date if you haven‚Äôt redeemed it.
2412,MindJoed,"April 30, 2020",5,Very good deals. Fine print most always explains and shipping costs and full details of the products. You can also click on link to website to see if  there are any additional charges or upgrades available.
2413,Oolmeda,"April 25, 2020",1,"Awful purchase experience It says I have an account, but won‚Äôt let me sign in. It says I need to create an account, but won‚Äôt let me because I already have an account. It says I need to update password, but because I cannot sign on nor create an account there‚Äôs nothing I can do about the password. Such a cluster_ transaction. Had to finish the purchase under a different sign on. What a waste. I just hope that what I ordered is good. Otherwise, I can imagine what a nightmare it will be if I have to return the order."

I also traded Another Groupon in about the same time & I didn‚Äôt get credited for both of them. I know they Both were not just worth $72!

When I called Hydrocare with the coupon they said they were backed up and could not schedule but would call me back in 2 weeks. When they did not call I called them back and they said they could not do the job and to tell Groupon and Groupon would refund my money.

Can't ask for more than that!"
2420,Bills manager,"December 14, 2019",5,I can never get enough I absolutely love using Groupon. I can always find what I‚Äôm looking for and at a really good price.

2421,RoughDiamondE,"November 12, 2019",2,"Ok but confusing I just made a purchase that was one of 3 purchases, but the system charged for the one purchase and the other two remained separate in the cart. The system is confusing. Also, The system says I have $42 credit, but the credit never showed up in my cart. Therefore when I selected purchase, the charge came off my credit card. Where my $42 credit went, who knows! Now i‚Äôm searching for a contact number!"
2422,Deuce321,"October 28, 2019",1,"Zero customer support It‚Äôs impossible to resolve issues with them.. Groupon has no customer support.

2520,Drivingmeemah,"October 4, 2019",5,Panties I attempted to exchange panties that came that did not fit. They have never been worn. Now I have been told that they are not returnable or exchangeable. I simply need a different size so it would be an exchange. I can‚Äôt get a response from the company other than that.  No find print was available on this item. 
2521,Hjsik,"September 30, 2019",1,A Very Unsatisfied Customer Groupon can do nothing for you if you need to cancel or get a refund. Even tho your screen has said ‚Äúapproval of cancellation/refund‚Äù and you still get charged for that purchase. You can not find the customer service rep without looking up online. Very frustrating when you have the option to only click links to find what you‚Äôre NOT looking for. Purchasing Tickets for any entertainment or activity takes too long to process. I do not recommend Groupon!!
2522,lmorlock,"September 27, 2019",4,LMorlock I love Groupon and over the years have gotten some good deals. The thing I don‚Äôt like is that I have lost a a lot of money because I purchased deals and didn‚Äôt use them. Groupon says amount paid doesn‚Äôt expire but if you don‚Äôt claim it before it expires you lose the amount you paid for the item you didn‚Äôt use.
2523,BH Judie,"September 16, 2019",5,Groupon Mostly everything I have purchased is exactly Wht I purchased. If there is a mistake they cover and I can return it.

2528,Haneloki,"August 9, 2019",5,A lot more than you think Great app with great deals. There's amotmore deals if you use the search option!!! Easy to pay with Apple Pay and free shipping!!! And now it's cash back onto your card so I don't have to embarrassing say I have a coupon to use. Easy and great way to save money!
2529,treetroll,"July 28, 2019",4,New to Groupon I started using Groupon a few months ago and have been pleased with all my purchases. My only complaint (and this is my fault) is that I am often surprised by how small many of the facial products are that I‚Äôve received‚Äîthey look like sample sizes. It would be good to have an object‚Äîlike a quarter‚Äîincluded in the photos.
2530,RJ4ever,"March 27, 2019",5,"I love the deals I hate having to pay full price for anything, so I love getting deals for my family. Tons of fun things to do for a great price. Trampoline Parks, indoor playgrounds, bowling, even deals for items or restaurants, and things to do on vacations. Groupon has tons of deals on practically everything!"
2531,SKUVKRAM,"April 20, 2019",2,How can it take 2 hours to process in 2019? The deals are obviously great. However it is astonishing that anything in the digital world take up to 2 hours to process. Especially digital coupons. You‚Äôd think that they are supposed to process immediately. Now I remember why I stopped using this app back in 2013. The fact that you have to wait 2 hours for anything to process almost makes it worth paying the full price.
2532,JocH77,"April 21, 2019",1,Can‚Äôt get a refund Be careful adding your credit card info to the app. Somehow I opened the app while my phone was in my pocket. It only took a couple of clicks to place an order for a local deal that Groupon is not able to refund because the fine print states ‚Äúsales are final‚Äù. I even told them it was fraud but they did not find fraudulent activity so they won‚Äôt give me my money back. The only solution they offered was to ‚Äúgive the deal to a friend or family member‚Äù if I am not able to use it myself.
2533,ta sherman,"May 5, 2019",5,"To all the Groupons I‚Äôve bought I‚Äôve loved 98% of you.  And I‚Äôve saved so much!

Always, always, always read the fine print for expiration and blackout dates. My only gripe is that I have to check our one deal at a time. I‚Äôm sure it has a reason but annoying to not just keeep a cart until I‚Äôm done."

2538,jennilxve,"July 24, 2019",5,"Great deals This app is a money saving gem, I always check here before I go and pay full price. The one time I had to contact customer service she was very helpful and fast. It was because the actual merchant was hard to get a hold of so I switched the voucher to another."
2539,Debbow1976,"July 17, 2019",4,"Love the App on the iPhone. Computer? Not so much I received an email with an offer that sparked my interest, so I clicked on the link and decided to buy. The only problem was the Groupon site on the computer refused to acknowledge my purchase. So, I got on the app on my phone and the purchase went right through. "
2540,Smoothmona,"February 3, 2019",5,"Great shopping app I have been using Groupon for years and I love it!

2542,Simonetek,"February 9, 2019",4,"Customer support improving quite a bit I really would like to give Groupon five stars, and I think it is very close. It is a 4.5 now. customer support has improved. But they should make it more obvious/be more transparent about the Groupon‚Äòs that are non-refundable. In other words, the Groupons you cannot trade. That would affect my decision to buy some of the Groupons."
2543,iluvsun,"February 10, 2019",4,"Good deals! I love Groupon‚Äôs great deals!  I have bought many services in places all over the world!  I just wish more restaurants in Honolulu would use them.

2545,Nyabuns,"February 24, 2019",4,Great app most of the time The only thing I would suggest is having Groupon affiliates pretend to be customers at various places advertised on Groupon to verify if business are upholding their promises prices. Several times I‚Äôve gone to places to find out I couldn‚Äôt use the Groupon anymore or their actual prices were cheaper than the Groupon.
2546,Jtneal,"February 26, 2019",5,Groupon I have purchased numerous times on Groupon and they have always delivered a quality product exactly as is promoted!  They send me reminders that I haven‚Äôt used coupons yet and always have a wonderful selection of products and events to choose from! Love Groupon!
2547,Bamah/Gramah,"March 9, 2019",5,Beth/Bahma Groupons offer excellent options!  I have used the ‚Äúfun things to do‚Äù line. Their choices provide excellent savings for an endless number of exciting adventures for all ages. 
2548,Lepidopterista,"March 15, 2019",4,"Lots of options and great prices Groupon has been a great source for fun family things to do! I wish they still had the option for Groupon extensions though. Getting a $5 deal and then letting it expires only gives you $5 to go towards the item (which is always so much more than $5!). Other than that, happy!"
2549,AndIdontchangepasswordseither,"March 27, 2019",3,Expirations I think it is unnecessary and unreasonable for a vendor to be unable to accommodate a purchaser and then have the coupon expire. You should refund or credit my account when that happens. I bought a massage for when I was in Denver and the merchant couldn‚Äôt fit my schedule for days until I had left town. Same thing happened in Chicago when I tried to use the Architectural boat tour.
2550,abby212BBB,"November 25, 2018",5,"great deals, nice customer service was pleasantly surprised when I accidentally almost let my groupon to a dance class expire, when groupon emailed me asking if i would like to trade it in for something else (at same value! and longer exp date!). Now I‚Äôm going to a mani/pedi before my holiday vacation! what a treat!!!!"
2551,Paul-1975,"December 23, 2018",5,Fun application The deals are always written with a bit of humor which is nice compared to most other broadcast or online ads. The only reason I am not rating this a 5 is because of all the recent travel ads; there should be a way to squelch those.
2552,Pumpkin pie2,"December 29, 2018",5,"Awesome for certain things I‚Äôve been using Groupon for many years. There are certain staples that I only ever purchase through them. Puppy pads (for now 8 yr old Chihuahua), and others that are hit or miss. They are excellent at returning a product if it doesn‚Äôt meet your expectations, and usually shipping is free."
2553,selahpraise,"December 29, 2018",5,Good products I have had only one incident where the product was damaged during shipping so was not able to get the product.  Groupon give me credit back for that product right away and so took care of my problem immediately.

They said my purchase was still in production. Allow 18 days for delivery. Day 25 I reached out again and once again received the same ‚Äúin production‚Äù explanation. I requested a refund and the communication was lost. I reached out to Groupon. Told them the situation. The rep basically said too bad so sad. It‚Äôs up to the merchant IF they want to give me a refund or not. What kind of business is this? Total SCAM.

Their phone number plays a message that you can contact them through the website and then it says Goodbye and hangs up. There is no chat on the website. Email form is only for press inquiries. I will show you press if no one reaches out to me today! I used to recommend you to all of my friends but if this is how you treat your loyal customers you shouldn‚Äôt be in business anymore.

My nails looked like they were a week old when she finished. I know we are getting a reduced rate on service, but I expect more. I contacted Groupon regarding this but they did not want to give me any credit regarding this matter. If a merchant does not do what they are suppose to‚Äî then I am not getting my money‚Äôs worth. Groupon should do better."

It has phenomenal deals and there‚Äôs never a bad experience with the condition the package arrives in. I only got frustrated when it said it‚Äôll arrive 4-7 days from the shipment date but maybe 1 or 2 times it didn‚Äôt. Other than that I may be addicted to it.

2635,Marriagethenawedding,"March 14, 2019",4,Good deals I don‚Äôt like all the deals but the app is easy to use and they usually try to resolve any issues between customers and vendors. Some of the vendors are tricky with their wording which I don‚Äôt like but overall Groupon is a good way to try something out that you‚Äôre not sure about and pay less while doing it.

Thank you for all the great deals & easy ( usually ! ) ordering!"
2645,armetz8449,"November 23, 2018",1,Groupon customer service is lacking There is no number to call for customer service and I have had issues with local merchants in the past which could not be resolved because of the lack of help options Groupon offers. The fact that you can only return groupons for a refund within 3 days after purchase without exception is restrictive and unreasonable particularly if you can‚Äôt contact the merchant within that time period. Will not be purchasing from Groupon again.

2706,skylane2,"June 28, 2019",4,Dependable I have been buying products and vacations from Groupon for about 4 years now and I can say they are reliable and precise in the orders I have purchased through them. 2 times I have had to return items that were broken or not what they claim to be . It was easy to contact Groupon and get a refund.

2708,CEGCVS,"June 18, 2019",5,"Great Deals you can‚Äôt find on your own I started using Groupon over a year ago.

2709,linn0730,"June 15, 2019",1,Unfortunately. A few weeks ago someone hacked my Groupon & attempted to charge $300+ to my account they changed the phone number & my shipping info to some place in NY. Groupon was able to cancel & make sure that I wasn‚Äôt charged for any of the items but I‚Äôve heard from friends that something similar has happened to them also so I have lost all confidence in using Groupon. I hope that somehow they strengthen their security but as for now I will be deleting & no longer making purchases.

However, I‚Äôm only going to purchase small items like these car washes, because one day when I went to access my groupons EVERYTHING I PURCHASED AND HADN'T USED WERE ALL GONE!!!  I‚Äôm the only one who has access to my iPad so this means someone from Groupon had to have accessed my account.  If you‚Äôre going to have it mailed to you, you can count on that, however I wouldn‚Äôt buy big purchase items that are accessed through the App."

They complained to me as a customer that Groupon don‚Äôt pay them and they have to provide services that have been sold on Groupon. Also as customer, customer service doesn‚Äôt exist. In beginning when Groupon just start proving services, Groupon was great! Had a lots of products, services, good price, able to call and speak with customer service. Now all that vanished."

2722,Gruffy Mcgee,"January 1, 2019",1,"Do not purchase cotton sheets from Groupon! For the second time, I‚Äôve ordered 100% organic cotton sheets, 600 thread count, and received microfiber/polyester sheets. The most recent time, December 2018, there was no label on the clear plastic cover saying what the fabric is made from and no company label. It was immediately clear when I touched the sheets that they were not 100% cotton. They are trying to rip people off with hopes no one will notice how incredibly cheap the sheets are. I will never purchase an item on Groupon ever again. No one should buy sheets from them. Ever."

2732,Soozi33,"November 12, 2018",4,How to cancel I tried cancel a order and it took me over a hour to do so. I had to chat live to someone that was able to get it done. For older people it not easy to do things this way. You need a valid phone number to be able to cancel by phone. You make it easy to order but hard to cancel.
2733,C Sure,"November 14, 2018",5,"What‚Äôs new? I LOVE IT!! I love to look and see what Groupon has to offer when I am looking for a new place to eat.

Would de recommend to friends and family!"
2740,ERZ110516,"July 24, 2018",1,Terrible customer service They have terrible customer service and it‚Äôs ridiculous that you can‚Äôt talk to anyone via telephone when you call their customer service number. If you want to purchase a groupon from another country (hence different currency) you can‚Äôt use a gift card or the exchange rate is 1 dollar US currency= 1 dollar other currency. I asked who would receive the extra money since I wanted to purchase something in CAD dollars. They claimed the company who was advertising the groupon!
2741,Gojomo99999,"July 29, 2018",4,Love the deals I find Groupon wonderful. I think I‚Äôm addicted. Lol. Had a problem with one of my purchases and they easily took care of it.

2744,BVasaly,"August 25, 2018",5,"Groupon stands behind their offers I have made many purchases here.  Groupon is a very reliable, ethical organization.  I don‚Äôt hesitate to buy things here, they will make it right even if the seller won‚Äôt, based on my few experiences when something did go wrong."
2745,NewportTownie,"September 4, 2018",4,"Good offers, but act fast! Lots of great products at prices that are  usually very favorable. So favorable that if you don‚Äôt grab them, they run out of sizes or styles if not out of the product itself.  Restaurant offers are great also, but almost all are at places a long way off. Not much offered in my town (Newport), which tends to live in the pre-digital age."

What a deal all for $99 for Two people all inclusive! What a great app and the deals are fabulous! I highly recommend it!
2751,Squirrely dizzle,"May 19, 2018",1,"No customer service Email is not sufficient for customer service inquiries, nor is the live chat feature. You will end up spending more time than the amount of money you save if you have any issues. My account was jeopardized and the email was switched without my consent even though they claim this is not possible. An otherwise great service that is ruined by poor customer service. I guess Groupon is following in the footsteps of other poorly run companies in Illinois like Comcast."
2752,Clot01,"May 20, 2018",5,"Reliable and recommended. I find Groupon items to be of good quality.  The items arrive unbroken, packed well and on time. I have not had a problem so far including an item I returned.  I have been a customer for several years. Thank Groupon job well done."

Because of the savings, I've done things I've never thought I'd do.  I would rate 5 stars but most Goods will not ship to Hawaii so if it could somehow filter what goods can or can not be shipped to Hawaii would raise my rating to 5 stars."

2873,jefreez,"April 12, 2018",2,Confusing discount The Shark HV320 vacuum stick was advertised in your 50% off section. There was red lettering on the page stating that a $10 off was available until 4/15. When I tried to purchase the item I only received the 50% off. When I messaged the representative she informed me that all discounts are included in the 50% off. I think I have purchased other items receiving the additional discount. I feel there was a mistake or the ad is misleading.

Very aggravating to get your order near the end of the movie."

Thrilled when Groupon reached out to offer me credit for the amount of the cards toward another purchase.

2956,Creationstory,"February 24, 2019",5,Great platform! Groupon saves a lot of money and our family uses it for different things like field trips and for purchasing items that we need for ourselves or to give away to friends. The app is super easy to use and very user-friendly.

2958,danny 4_real,"March 14, 2019",5,"Groupon is Life!! Everything I find on Groupon is not only quality but it is definitely exactly what they describe. I don‚Äôt book restaurants on Groupon anymore, it‚Äôs just not worth it to me. Spa packages, continued education, seminars, and cool things to have is always cool to look at and reserve and buy . Again ! Groupon is LIFE!"
2959,Suebee Travel 101,"April 16, 2019",5,Travel bargain When I‚Äôm going to be traveling to another area. I always check the Groupon for that city. It has given me ideas on places to see and things to do that I would never have  known about... plus has saved me a lot of money. Love Groupon !!

2963,clarebur,"November 17, 2018",5,New experiences Groupon has great deals for places and things you want to try out for less than retail. It gives businesses ways to market themselves and help us customers decide if it was worth the price. I use Groupon for everything I do and may need.
2964,PaSaZaGa,"November 27, 2018",5,Busy Mom I get fantastic gifts for everyone in the family and myself! I have only had one bad vendor experience and Groupon quickly took care of it for me. The support team is very responsive and always helpful. I will continue to support them in the new year.
2965,Cant get refund,"November 27, 2018",1,"Can‚Äôt get a refund I have been trying to get in contact with someone from Groupon in getting a refund. Groupon is advertising goods and services from local companies that isn‚Äôt honoring your redemption for your GROUPON...which, has been paid for. I keep getting the run around in trying to get a credit for something I couldn‚Äôt even receive...Groupon should not be advertising goods and services on their site if you can‚Äôt redeem your Groupon. I will never use Groupon, again. Buyers please be aware ."

2968,Mariabonita95,"January 5, 2019",4,"Overall Great! I‚Äôm happy with Groupon and the app, but I wish you could buy multiple items with the app and then pay all at once at the end of the transaction, rather than having to pay for each item individually-that way, the items added up could give you free shipping."
2969,upsetcuatomer,"January 5, 2019",1,"Is Groupon a Fraud Scam? Awful customer service.  Was given a Groupon for Zumba classes during Christmas.  The merchant doesn‚Äôt exist.  The location doesn‚Äôt exist, and the phone number on Groupon isn‚Äôt answered."

2976,witchbb805,"July 29, 2018",1,"Too easy to hit ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù on accident It‚Äôs far too easy to hit ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù on accident. The app also is constantly sending ads and reminders, so if you hit one, it opens the app. This happened to me when I had my phone in my pocket, and ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù got hit on a local deal that I hadn‚Äôt even scheduled. Asked customer service for help, who said they reset it, but it reverted back... they have not been helpful since so now I am out the deal I paid for because it expired and customer service won‚Äôt do anything."
2977,trunks.cscs,"August 17, 2018",5,"A great way to save money As long as you only purchase Groupons for items that you are in need of, it's a great way to save money.

2979,kspigener,"September 9, 2018",4,Gettin it on with Groupon Love the Groupon iPhone app and the item selection. Only issue is related to several items that I have purchased and I never received. This issue is with the seller‚Äôs that advertise on Groupon . Always take the time to read the reviews (Stars) of the item you plan to purchase before you buy.
2980,Mitzi2go,"April 28, 2018",5,Love! Groupon deals have helped me find my hairdresser and afford local and vacation destination experiences I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise tried. I always check available Groupons before heading out of town! Have never had an issue using them anywhere. Love Groupon!

2985,TaylorReviews,"June 28, 2018",1,"Horrible Customer Service Groupon is fine until you encounter an error. Once an error occurs you can‚Äôt call to get assistance. They have live chat that has no live representatives, they have no customer service phone lines, and the email takes 48 hours to get a response. It is a generic response that they don‚Äôt reply to if the response doesn‚Äôt answer your question. Hopefully when you use them you don‚Äôt encounter any problems...if you do there are no physical agents available to help."

The couch has not yet arrived, and I‚Äôve been trying to find out where it is. If you know anything about Groupon you know the only way to contact them is through a live chat. The live chat is absolutely terrible! It doesn‚Äôt work half the time, and it will all the sudden cut you off the other half of the time. I still have no couch. And I am out $500."

I will continue to be a Groupon customer for that very reason!

3029,groupon Mike,"July 20, 2019",5,Groupon really takes care of its customers I had accidentally left one of my coupons expire and they were nice enough to allow me to trade it for a new deal. Not a lot of companies would go above and beyond for their customers mistakes but Groupon does.
3030,Clbbse dino,"May 14, 2019",5,So easy!!  And I got a great tech I didn‚Äôt even know Snailz existed.  It took 2 minutes and now I have the app forever.

3036,Puffect73,"July 1, 2019",3,"Great deals This app has found me so many great deals. Not only do you get great deals but if you are unhappy with your purchase they help you get  your issue resolved. The only reason Groupon doesn‚Äôt get a 5 star is because it is very hard to contact customer service. They do not give you a number, just an email address. I prefer to call and talk to someone."

The app is super easy to use and the information is easy to follow."
3040,sexy @75,"March 19, 2019",5,Specials This is the best in it's field.  The customer service employees go beyond just helping with your problem.  If your Groupon is close to ending you can get an extension or change to something else.  I would highly recommend giving them a try.

3045,haloman555,"April 9, 2019",5,Best place to get quality items for far less! I have ordered a number of times at first I must admit I was skeptical of the quality because the prices were so low.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Every time I have ordered from Groupons I am so excited!  A satisfied customer!

As someone that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of money, but wants to do things with my kids Groupon has allowed me do do some fun things that I otherwise would say I can‚Äôt afford. Got an all day play pass for Dave and Busters, should be fun!"

I also have a hard time purchasing what I can‚Äôt see or know about fully because it may not be what you want.  Pretty good on sure things though.
3054,kisernl,"January 27, 2019",1,"App only works on wifi I have the app on my iPhone XR - works fine over WiFi, but will not connect over LTE (app reads ‚Äúwaiting for internet connection‚Äù or ‚Äúno internet connection‚Äù even though phone has strong LTE and Safari and other apps run perfectly).

Please update app and address LTE connectivity issues."

3067,Dancing girl14,"December 30, 2018",5,So far so good! I've been very happy with my Groupon experience! They now offer a trade in option for expired purchases which I love! Some businesses overestimate their ability when they offer a Groupon and it becomes impossible to get an appointment. This trade in option is awesome!
3068,MyWalterboy,"January 3, 2019",3,"Shipping charges not worth it I used to love Groupon and would buy several items from there. Lately I‚Äôve noticed that the shipping charges make the items not worth buying. I can‚Äôt add things to my cart and pay one shipping charge, I have to pay different charges for every item. Like I said earlier, it makes the items almost not worth buying."

3070,Jeanne L 05,"September 21, 2018",4,Jeanne LB Groupon offers me the opportunity to try things I Never would have considered. Much better choices (especially quality choices) than other coupon companies. I can go on & on about lies & lack of quality with other coupon companies. Thanks offering me these quality companies.
3071,Ihunt64,"October 1, 2018",4,Great deals Always love the deals on here. The groupon trade in is great but wish you had more time. Repurchasing something is easy but I am giving it 4 stars due to the difficulty of picking options when you‚Äôre attempting to rebuy something. You lose the ability to pick options like color or size.
3072,Indie&Irie,"October 2, 2018",5,You can find anything! I absolutely love Groupon! You can find anything. I have not had any issues yet and I have ordered several items on here from pet supplies to kitchen items. The prices are Amazing and delivery is quick! I recommend this app to all.

3074,kjshipp,"October 29, 2018",5,"Great! I use Groupon in Dallas, and it saves you so much money, even if there‚Äôs tickets for the same events on other sites. Always pay attention to the fine print and detail of your Groupon sometimes it‚Äôs only for certain days or times."

In the rare instance where I was disappointed (say like with a restaurant) I was credited my original purchase amount (since we left the restaurant before we even ordered).

3084,Bradley Fam Fam,"August 7, 2018",4,"Good fun Kids loved it! Especially the virtual reality simulator! Only thing that I would critique was that some of the games that you win tickets were either out of order or simply just did not work.

3095,AmyPartyof2,"June 23, 2018",5,"Love it too much! Everything I‚Äôve ordered has been of exceptional quality. A few things have taken quite a bit longer shipping than stated, but Groupon isn‚Äôt responsible for weather, holidays and the mail. Overall, excellent."

Will have to delete soon. Why would you send me multiple messages every day. One every other day or at WORST one a day. Not a lot of options to choose from. Not higher end places. Too many notifications about total crap. Needs to improve

3120,Kendall Rusha,"March 26, 2020",1,Bad business Warning!! If you spend any money with Groupon and cannot use your your voucher you will not see your money back. Instead what they offer is poor customer service and a voucher to continue using their business. If you try to close your account they simply remind you that it is at the loss of your money. I am currently stuck with 3 concerts I won‚Äôt be attending and $150 in credit I can‚Äôt use anywhere but on Groupon. If I could give negative stars I would!
3121,disgusted246,"February 19, 2020",2,"Some deals are good Just bought two Apple Watch bands for $31 (includes $4 shipping) and Groupon congratulated me on saving $271. At the Apple store they cost $50 each (I know because I bought one 4 months ago). So I actually saved $69. This is still a nice savings, but they over shot their claimed savings considerably. "

3123,justinelg88,"February 3, 2020",4,4 stars I really enjoy Groupon and it‚Äôs a nice place to do shopping all in one place but sometimes I notice that they will price the regular price super high and sell a product for the same price you would find anywhere else so you think you‚Äôre getting a better deal than you really are.
3124,tisheswishes,"January 29, 2020",3,Great deals but lack in customer service I have used and love Groupon for many years. I love Groupon. The only thing is they have no way to contact customer support by phone. For a company this size I would think this could be possible. I am on the process of trying to get a refund and we shall see how the online support will work. They sure make it hard.
3125,BaysMomMom,"January 24, 2020",2,"App is great CS not so much The app and website work pretty well. However, the customer service is lacking at best. Typically, you‚Äôll be speaking with someone who isn‚Äôt fluent in English and is working remotely from a call center whether you speak via chat or phone. If you can navigate without an issue, by all means use it but fingers crossed you won‚Äôt have to speak with anyone because they don‚Äôt really know how to do anything off script"

You all are refunding me my money for the first set of tickets to wild n out supposedly but that‚Äôs not helping me in the mean then waiting on the refund.

3130,creb86,"December 27, 2019",4,A lot of great deals Double check that the original pricing listed is accurate because a lot of them are not. They are inflated to appear as a great deal but are really the same price as if you bought it at the venue. But there are plenty on here that are truly great deals. And I highly recommend using Groupon.
3131,angelberry27,"December 2, 2019",5,"LOVE Groupon! We love Groupon and use it for so many things.

3132,StephNJ,"November 26, 2019",3,ok I have been using the app for years but I am extremely cautious with what I purchase. Most times local deals are difficult to use and just because they are sold does not make them valid with vendors.

And others don‚Äôt show the poor ratings. So I‚Äôm not sure if I can trust to spend my money on trying out new foods like I have done in the past. Also groupons expire early and without notification. Then I just loose out on money. I personally won‚Äôt be using the app again.
3134,jclark2323,"November 12, 2019",1,"Groupon not available for Customer service I booked and got charged on an old card on an old account. They have charged it twice now. And I have my cc I wanted to use, and through the sight it said it went through. But I have yet to receive confirmation. Even though I got immediate decline from my non existent card. I have called the hotel twice and also  tried to contact Groupon several times. No proper response. This is ridiculous. I will never use Groupon again.."
3135,nwgreg,"November 11, 2019",5,Love Groupon It has taken me to places I would never have gone without it. And I‚Äôve gone back to those places again and again because Groupon has never disappointed. Thank you for opening windows on the world!

3137,bittenntwice,"November 6, 2019",3,"Good deal, slow processing The deal was good.  I inadvertently hit buy with an old credit card number.  It took a very long time (up to 2 hours it says) to ‚Äúprocess‚Äù...a normal thing I guess.  I did it twice, my bad &/or site/sequencing is not the best.  I later figured how to cancel the order...so I could reorder with correct card number without having to wait two hours."
3138,PB123!,"November 4, 2019",4,Great customer service and deals Recently had a bad experience with a merchant and Groupon customer service tried to be helpful as they could and tried to take care of it for me on behalf of the merchant who didn‚Äôt even bother to reach out to me after trying to contact  multiple times
3139,Townsend 47,"November 3, 2019",1,"Buy not going into Cart but purchase I do not like when I see an item and I press buy and sometimes it goes in a cart for purchase and then sometimes I press buy and it goes straight to purchasing , and I can‚Äôt take it back, like the $5 shades, which I don‚Äôt know if black or brown was ordered, which I wanted brown, but there was no color selection.. I do not like that about Groupon .  As a customer every time I select an item I want it to go into a cart just in case I change my mind."
3140,hangryChristo,"October 28, 2019",1,Needs better customer support About three days I was charged from something I‚Äôve never purchased. I sent an email and got a response back pretty much saying that they can not tell me why I was charged because the account that used my card was different which I think is ridiculous if someone is using my card information on something I never purchased I should be able to know what was purchased and where and get my money back.
3141,xbanks393,"October 6, 2019",1,"Worst Experience! Long story short, I purchased a bowling listing to attend with the family. Upon arrival I pull up the app for the representative to scan. Unfortunately I never received a barcode, instead I was faced with a REDEEMED screen. Leaving nothing the representative could do. So I reached up to customer service to them informing me that I had to wait 24-48hrs for them to contact the merchant to verify that it was indeed not used. Very upsetting experience, not sure if I will be doing business with Groupon in the future!"

We had lamb kabobs which were cooked to perfection and the stuffed sole was just scrumptious.  The restaurant is small and inviting and the service was terrific.  We gave our experience tonight a 10+.
3144,FranStGw,"August 25, 2019",4,"My review I like purchasing things on Groupon.  It introduces me to new restaurants and offers deals that I normally would not have considered.

You‚Äôre better off just avoiding the hassle to price shop on your own. In addition, customer service is virtually impossible to get ahold of, and good luck finding a phone number to call."

There has been only one really botched order and even that one was taken care of as quickly as it was reported. I would have given Groupon five stars, but I still question where some of the pricing comes from."
3154,ElkGroveDivaMom,"July 1, 2019",1,Zero Points For Customer Service I've been trying to reach customer service for items I did not order and there is no way to contact these guys on their website. Then they want to know how their website is working. Not friendly at all. Question? Is there a # to speak to a live person? If you can't reach anyone via email or phone and orders have been placed erroneously then how in the world can you cancel in two hours? Never will use them again.
3155,ES350 owner,"June 30, 2019",5,"Nice prices, good customer service. I‚Äôve had to report a couple sellers in the past and received my refund very quickly. Fun shopping and introduction to new businesses and activities in my area. Also can shop for deals in areas where I vacation."

3163,Little Pooobah,"April 24, 2019",4,"Great deals, processing problems. I have made several purchases through Groupon, and I have been very happy with the merchandise. Unfortunately, there was a glitch just now when I used Apple Pay: It charged my bank card instead of my Apple Pay wallet cash which was the option I had chosen."
3164,Urgin' for sturgeon,"May 1, 2019",3,Why I love and hate Groupon I love Groupon for the fact that it is family friendly... lots of Groupons for things to do with the family. What I hate about Groupon is that it has become stagnant in the dining options. Seems to be a select group of restaurants that are available. I would like to see Groupon reach out to more establishments and try and expand the choices
3165,SstJohn86,"May 1, 2019",1,"Worst Customer service Ever Groupon will not allow me to purchase. Why? Nobody knows. They said it was because I‚Äôd already purchase the deal previously- that was false, it‚Äôs not even in my purchase history. Then they said it‚Äôs because my last name in my account is wrong- which it is, but the website wont let me correct my name. The billing and CC information is all correct- and. Nobody can help me with any of this. "

3169,Gabinator.666,"May 25, 2019",5,"Great deals most of the time App is really functional, never crashes, never has bugs. Also, Groupon has great deals available, but the major downside is they aren't carefully curated so some stupid/bad services and products are available."

There are WAY more exclusions than ones that actually accept your ‚Äúdeals‚Äù so it‚Äôs very misleading and frustrating. When you send a deal and give me the SHOP NOW button you should make it so anything that shows up when you click SHOP NOW works with your ‚Äúdeals‚Äù. Filter out the exclusions somehow!

Kind of annoying
3278,Nicki62,"May 18, 2019",2,Clothing vs. events Groupon is inconsistent. My experiences started out good initially; however several subsequent events/purchases have been less than desirable. I‚Äôve learned to contact the merchant whenever possible. This is not always an option. Some events cancel and refunds are null and void. Other purchases are sent in separate shipments and only part of the items were received and no contact information was provided.
3279,Hedduh,"May 26, 2019",1,Upset I recently purchased an item and apparently the order failed and I had no idea why because it said it was processed and would be shipped. Then the color of the item that I wanted was sold out. It‚Äôs upsetting because I wanted this specific item and color and if I had known before hand I would have repurchased the item while the color was still available. I spoke to a groupon employee and I was not even offered at least a discount on a different item.
3280,PJK1017,"January 11, 2019",5,Groupon products and customer service I have been a long time Groupon customer. The products they carry and the prices cannot be beat. The Resturant deals are great. Customer. Service is always polite and helpful . Highly recommend Groupon to anyone!!!

3424,LorMichele,"November 29, 2018",5,"Great place to find good deals When I see a product that I am interested in, Groupons usually offers it for less than any of my other shopping sites. Just always check what shipping will cost is the downside sometimes."

3428,kietp,"December 24, 2018",1,"Misleading rating reviews Groupon doesn‚Äôt accept NEGATIVE reviews. I have used Goupon a lot, but I don‚Äôt trust Groupon ratings any more. I realize that Groupon won‚Äôt let you give the vendors negative reviews. It happens to me THREE times now. Either I got system error or my negative review didn‚Äôt show up. This is no coincidence after 3 different times. All of my positive reviews were fine. None of my negative reviews came through. In conclusion, we can not trust Groupon review system. BAD! Misleading customer. Bad business practice."

Contacted customer service and they said they could not help because all sales are final. Spent $80, and can‚Äôt go to event. Contact Groupon customer support 15 minutes after sale and they said they could not help.  If you like getting swindled without any recourse by all means get Groupon. If you believe in customer service and getting what you paid for, don‚Äôt go with Groupon."
3432,I love boots!,"October 6, 2018",1,"Can I just get my boots? Geeeezzz! I have tried to order moccasins boots from this company at lease two times. I wanted to see if they were just as good as the hundred dollar moccasins. I got two Fedex tracking numbers and my boots were never shipped. Groupon agree to give me a refund in Groupon bucks only and not to my debit card. So I had to buy something else from this company. So, I brought another pair of boots which were not the moccasins and paid extra for expedited shipping. I hope I get my boots this time."

3504,TNTab,"October 30, 2019",2,"Deal? Or no deal...... This used to be a great deal site. Now if you can‚Äôt make it or the merchant cancels on you they only allow Groupon bucks to be redeemed on certain deals with restrictions and limitations, forcing the customer into a purchase because if you don‚Äôt buy something within 24 hours you basically lose the money spent. Waste of time and waste of money. Lack of customer service and care."

3507,SwimThruLife,"September 22, 2019",1,"Groupon has Terrible Customer Service I received a Groupon as a gift and before I could redeem the services, the business the voucher was for closed unexpectedly. I tried contacting Groupon in various ways to see if I could get the Groupon refunded or put towards another similar service but never heard back from them and lost the voucher and the money when it expired 3 months after I tried to contact Groupon via email, phone and their website. Very disappointing."

3534,Apyne,"May 12, 2019",3,Garbage UI and usability with latest version Latest version of the app is the perfect example of how some idiots in a company can completely destroy the UI and usability factor of a superb app. If Groupon management is seriously reading these reviews they need to retrospect and throw out such such nonsense UI designers who turns a perfect app to a piece of garbage which is now difficult and confusing to navigate.

3593,GGSanfranciscoca,"May 12, 2018",1,Impossible to get customer service Buyer beware! I had a issue with an order where the priced charged was incorrect. You have to search for the customer service number.  It is no where on the site. You have to actually search help for ‚Äúcustomer service phone number‚Äù. Then it is only available for limited hours. If I want to get the price correct I have to send the item back and wait three weeks for a refund. Worst customer experience ever!!

Don‚Äôt be fooled by the prices - most times it‚Äôs a ‚Äústarting price‚Äù and the actual product price is higher. The ‚Äúoriginal cost‚Äù is usually not correct, often well inflated.

There is a nonexistent customer service line. You lose your money if you don‚Äôt redeem your voucher. Many of the companies they work with will not honor the voucher or the money you spent on the voucher. Groupon does not refund the money. Also I ordered a cart from them that arrived ruined so it was a loss. What a horrible company, I think most of these good reviews must be paid for."

3972,Toemasuxsempai,"May 1, 2019",1,Needs to give users more custom options. There should be most customization in options as Groupon progresses.  We should be given the ability to delete our purchase history due to potential confidential reasons.  Or the ability to require touch/face ID when we open the groupon app.  This will help increase security for the app.  Also be given the ability to easily remove our search history.  Please review these concerns.

4134,Jjdd2012,"June 7, 2019",4,App functional My only complaint is that it is so hard to clarify what is included... what I‚Äôm actually getting.

I‚Äôm deleting this app. No good anymore..items are cheaply made and the shipping is costly, too. Better to look for the same exact item on EBay with FREE SHIPPING. Bad form, Groupon.

I gave it 4 stars because I‚Äôve had issues where I buy a voucher and the company doesn‚Äôt allow that voucher anymore.

4160,Defibman,"December 1, 2018",3,"Be Careful Make sure that the company is a National Secure company. If a Restaurant goes under, you will have a heck of a time getting your money back. I have several Groupons that has taken me a few years of communication and still they ignore my complaints saying that they are expired but yet they say that the Groupons don‚Äôt ever expire. They will just stop communications and ignore the obvious."

4169,McDowellfive,"January 1, 2019",1,Lousy deals then stuck with weird trade offers So fed up with Groupon gimmicks. I ordered tickets to a garden. They were closed during the fall when we went. Then Groupon says it expires in Dec. it‚Äôs an outdoor garden tickets purchased in fall. So they offer a trade for half the value. Lost money. Lost time. It‚Äôs a gimmick. Avoid Groupon and go when it‚Äôs convenient for your family not when Groupon tells you to. They sell off season then close the window. That‚Äôs how they make money.
4170,Prtybeautiful,"October 28, 2018",5,"Even better than what we know Everyone knows how wonderful Groupon is.

Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt, purchased some pictures frames for a great price, only to find out the shipping cost would have been over 100 dollars, which was ridiculous.

Felt abandoned when an oven I purchased was dropped by the delivery person and Groupon would do nothing about it. I would give more stars if this hadn‚Äôt happened. Free shipping more often would be good too.

4202,Captian Tibbs.,"July 7, 2018",4,"Good. Groupon is a very good site as long as you look at everything you buy with a knowledge of what your buying...  Like Walmart,Amazon,and or Costco you have to do a little investigation because not everything is cheaper on anyone place all the time. But if you investigate what you are buying you can SAVE MONEY."

If you press redeem accidentally you loose your money. When attempting to contact the company they never replied. My friend was over charged for her purchases and the difference never refunded. Buyer beware. I‚Äôm buying my state fair tickets through Costco next year and deleting this app, it is not user friendly and they do not reply to emails."

I would think Groupon would provide to it‚Äôs customers the upmost security. Last week I have 5 compromising transaction to my card. Last night I had another for almost $300 which I barely have. I have had 8 debit cards in the past 2 years. I will not be buying anything kn Groupon again until this issue is addressed and resolved. Highly disapponted.

4242,Toya624,"April 18, 2020",1,"Refused to refund my form of payment due to Covid-19 Only used because I have no choice. I have been using Groupon forever and made a lot of purchases but when I asked for my money back for monster trucks and a photo session which would clearly not be taking place due to Covid-19 they refused and only credited back to themselves as a credit, so now they lost a  customer for life by clearly not refund minimal purchases that could not be redeemed even if I wanted to. Adios Groupon!!!!!!!!"
