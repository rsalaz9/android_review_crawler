0,Abe Rad,"March 5, 2018",4,"The app asked for a review so here it is: First off I love what Medium is doing here. From a consumer of interesting writing, this is exactly what I want; no ads and very often articles that are interesting to me. The articles surfaced are improving as I use the service which is a good sign that what these people are doing with my usage is working."
1,Cinimon,"May 29, 2018",4,History is necessary for accidental page close outs. I must admit having been a medium member for the past few years I can tell you I’m never let down by quality. Writers on this app have their own unique way of connecting their audience. I can only hope that this corporation continues it’s journey of innovation for future of us writers. 
2,South_FL,"June 20, 2018",5,"Incredible. Worth Subscribing. To begin, the quality of writing is incredible. It’s introspective, but not pretentious or exhausting. There’s a journalistic standard preserved within this space that seems to be disintegrating across the board into an infinite heap of clickbait and sensationalism. In this context, I applaud the minimalism behind the apps design and philosophy as well as the unadulterated opinion pieces of the writers (who come from all spaces). "
3,Kyn Sage,"December 29, 2017",4,"Truly inspiring, and practically useful I use Medium every day. Usually I just click on my personal suggestion notifications! And I go from there. Sometimes I have a specific topic in mind, and search & browse until I inevitably find something useful and thoughtful(quick experience!). There are so many dedicated and bright minds writing on medium about what they know best, and I couldn't be happier or more pleased to have found a place they like to congregate for the benefit of anyone who wants to be a part of it. Topics upon topics, minds upon minds, growth upon growth. If you want to use it to your best, personalize your experience as much as you can, learn as quickly as you can(easily done!), and be open to the luck of your life experience to find what you need. Thank you Medium!"
4,Stefani Wilson,"January 7, 2019",1,"Stefani While I did enjoy the content on this site, I have to recommend ppl to not PAY for a membership. I bought the membership & the first month was fine- when it came time to renew then came the problem. First my membership disappeared & all of a sudden I was back to “free” status, limited to how much I could read. So I checked to make sure I was charged, sure was, charged TWICE actually. After attempting to contact someone three times through the app with no response, I went to the website & sent another help request. Finally I received a reply. I sent in everything they asked for, receipts, screenshots etc. still I cannot access the content I paid for & have not been given a refund, just another request for “the bottom portion of my membership email “ thank goodness I never delete my emails because that was sent way back in October!! So as much as I want to give them 5 stars for the reading content, their customer service is so terrible that I cannot recommend anything other than the free membership. Please do not give them any money or you will be facing a huge headache along with paying for the content everyone else gets for free!!!! BOO!!!!"
5,ceilidhKate,"March 10, 2019",4,"Taking Time for Medium I’ve only been reading Medium for a short time, and the horrific news about our current President has become a drug-like lure. Gotta rush through it, get all the opinions, force myself to actually listen and try to relate to Fox Infotainment. It all takes time."
6,Trust?Apple,"June 9, 2019",5,"Articles & Authors Alike Publishing In MEDIUM are “Worth In Gold & Diamonds” A General Comment about all the articles published by MEDIUM, that I will present here:"
7,WebGirl!,"April 11, 2020",5,"I’ve been a member since launch For me Medium started as a platform to test out, as a data analyst, it’s what we do. At first I was skeptical and wondered why we needed yet another form or medium when so many were available. What I discovered is that as a writer in practice and in passion- Medium made it easy for me to write and ‘want’ to write, the more I used it. I found the tool easy with features that allowed me to write drafts and ponder on them until I was ready to publish them. It also began growing as a source with valuable insights and learnings, as well as a way for me to connect with other strong minded working women who are dedicated in one form or another to the values of good communication and the evolution of learning. Medium is an outlet to express a thought but also a medium in which to continue my search for higher learning. "
8,"Akjalidnd48391""17","April 28, 2019",3,"Some great pieces, when I find them... I love some of the thought-provoking pieces on this platform, and my access to them after upgrading to premium. I love how easy it is to publish as well. However, more and more I’m running into articles that are either click-bait, or geared toward building the author’s brand (usually a combination of some buzz words and fluff), or just really poorly written. The primary method of content discovery is very heavily machine based; I used to try to get around that by first checking whether an article was heavily applauded, commented on (engaging), before investing time to read it, but unfortunately, that was removed in the redesign. The emails I receive re-emphasize this, and the interface doesn’t make it so easy to explore other writings (again because the assumption is that all the exploration you’ll ever need to do is in the list of machine generated articles). I long for a day where I don’t have to waste my time finding good content."
9,Alice Valkyrie,"March 30, 2019",2,"Too hard to find non-paywalled content I used to love Medium, and read articles on it quite frequently. However, about 95% of the featured articles now require a subscription. That would be slightly annoying but acceptable-if there were any way to filter your search to show only free content. Unless I’ve missed something, there’s not, which makes this app a nightmare to use for free users. With a search filter this app would get 4 stars."
10,Slybootie,"December 29, 2017",5,"Like learning? Enjoy great writing? Lack free time or impatient? You'll love Medium. Medium collects and consolidates top news articles covering every conceivable subject from breaking headline news to myriad categorically specific topics, e.g, latest news in behavioral psychology, tech, science, astronomy, computer coding, etc. "
11,SpoonLanternBaseballPark,"March 23, 2018",5,"Accessible as Facebook, but not as stupid There is a lot of time fragmentation in the modern world. Prior to downloading the medium app, I would often fill this time by reading Facebook. There is one major difference between Medium and Facebook, however. Reading medium makes me smarter. Reading Facebook makes me want to fight all my friends, family, and co-workers over often esoteric, ideological differences that truly have no bearing on reality or the ways that I interact with these people. In the end, I rather learn something I can use than learn that my favorite college math professor believes in trickle down economics. "
12,gxorlando,"May 28, 2018",3,"Conservative libertarian The platform works well until you realize that a lot of what is going is Progressives speaking to themselves in an nacho chamber on the paying side of the site with articles from other publications and authors who primarily represent the hardcore Progressive agenda, which is why many of us stay on the fringes or the unpaid side, since there is little balance on the paying side of the Fence. Medium has some very good authors on the Pay side, but they also have some down right bigots who do not deserve house room in that their logical and objective skills would get them a D at best in a College essay class since their research and background is abysmal, as well as their conclusions. But that might be said of a lot of journalists these days as well. So I refuse to pay to hear the same old same old, as much as I would like to participate in meaningful discussion, I see it seeping away on this site."
13,StonybrookTN,"July 31, 2018",5,"Medium DELIVERS the Message If we are to stay in our lanes and pay homage to McLuhan’s witty “The medium is the message” meta criticism, we could dismiss the Medium platform as just another channel for the Internet’s amateur-izaton of media.  But the proof is in the pudding.  Spend twenty minutes scrolling Facebook or Twitter, then spend twenty minutes reading articles on Medium.  There it is: content matters.  And Medium delivers.  And as far as UI and UX, we are dealing with next-level design with Medium.  Sleek, intuitive and up to the task of allowing users to create the kind of quality online articles that make sharing nuanced thought possible in a world of distracted social media apps.  You’ll open Medium to engage by reading, but you’ll find yourself starting and saving a draft for your own ideas.  This is a writer’s app, disguised as a reader’s online magazine."
14,Iphone&98,"October 25, 2018",4,"Clean app! I recently discovered Medium. I started reading very interesting posts on this website and I decided to download this app and give it an opportunity, which is something that I almost never do."
15,Rmlowrie,"December 31, 2018",3,"The same old “ Surprise Me” Stories Over And Over Don’t get me wrong, I really like the app, and the engaging articles that are in it, but sometimes… Just sometimes, I would like to be surprised with a new article, something I have not read before. I remember after first downloading the app, I was always surprised by a new, engaging, sometimes controversial article or topic and I really enjoyed it… Reading through them was great for me."

17,Staysfit,"April 2, 2020",4,"Forum with Expansive Repertoire of Easy to Read Articles, good fodder for writers and readers! This forum provides an avenue for writers to hone their skills,  writing short, clear, articles on varied topics of interest to the reader. Writers benefit by gaining experience, developing their style, gaining some name recognition, etc. Readers benefit from learning new information on a wide range of topics or perhaps delving into a specific area of interest.  You can tailor your feed to cater to preferred subjects or to branch out randomly, which is what I have done.  I enjoy reading about concerns I might never take much time to consider otherwise.  One problem I have had after reading one article on a topic, is my article feed becoming inundated with multiple similar articles on the same topic.  They recently added a feature to help reduce this problem.  It’s too soon for me to say whether it is a successful fix."
18,HopeDance,"February 5, 2020",5,"I love it so far and still need to learn more I love the format, I love that writers can have their space and love that others can follow writers they appreciate. I just finished reading one and I commented and then discovered a friend of mine wrote a piece and commented and saved, etc....  it am having a challenge of now where is it that I go to start writing another piece... and HOW can I paste an article that ought to be here... can’t figure that one out and even did a google search and nada... oh and did I add that writers can earn money and that’s a good thing and did I say that I love the typeface and the overall beauty of Medium.... Now I’m determined to find out how to start writing another piece... hahha you would think it would be easy but perhaps it’s because I may be an early dementia phase...."
19,RomrDrumr,"October 29, 2019",5,"Amazing reading app with unparalleled content- Subscribed & Happy I Did! Medium covers the kind of content, written by the kind of writers that I find exceptionally interesting and relevant. I really like that you know how long an article is going to take to read before you start reading it. The contextual suggestions at the bottom of each article are spot-on. This is a vastly better experience than reading an article on the web, given the amount of link spam involved.I make every effort to follow the writers and topics that are most interesting to me, and to promote them as much as possible across social media. The relevance algorithms and noise-free reading experience led me to finally subscribe, and happy I did! Use Medium and improve your mind & your career!"
20,JCBello,"December 11, 2017",5,"Start writing! It’s never been easier to share your work online. Medium connects you to a literate crowd, passionate people who read and write stories, articles, ideas, fiction and nonfiction, news and satire, philosophy and history, and so much more. It’s all here, written by writers for writers, or those aspiring to write. Even if you’re not a writer, there’s no better place to find quality reads online than on Medium. Best part: almost everything is FREE. There’s an option for a $5/month subscription to access additional content, but this mainly is to support your favorite writers and keep the website up to date. Highly recommend this app if you enjoy reading and writing."
21,Rickyhardrock,"May 13, 2018",4,"Good , but an idea I love medium and find great enjoyment in reading articles everyday so there was no hesitation to pay $5/month to be able to access more articles. The only feature I would recommend is, programming in to the app is an explore/topics section. Not only having the main page with one article from that topic that you’re interested, but being able to click an icon on the bottom and going to menu with all of the topics such as science or relationships or politics, etc. From there, being able to select that certain topic and see all articles from past and present. So that readers are able to have an opportunity to see more articles that they’re interested in at the moment."
22,ArseniyChern,"June 9, 2018",5,"I love it.. mostly I really love this app. It has some of the best content I’ve seen online. I am definitely going to pull the trigger on a subscription. My only real gripe is that if I exit the app it clears the story I’m reading out of ram and then I have to try to find it again.. which takes forever, I would love a feature where it would save the current story you are reading and when you go back into the app it would just go to that last story by default. Also if you could add a history feature that would show your reading history.. that would also be awesome. But those are small nitpicks. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for some awesome and intelligent reading content!"
23,Cajun Bella,"September 24, 2018",2,"Membership Subscription To avoid wasting my time and storage space, I researched Medium after I saw the in-app purchases and the ITunes description referenced paid membership being a ""perk"" and not required to read the articles. After reading two articles, I received a message  saying I would have to become a member to read additional articles as my free article limit had been exceeded this month. If those same messages would have appeared in my research instead of after downloading the app, it would have saved me time and now frustration.  Maybe I'm clueless or have lived under a rock, but why is there a fee required anyway?  It's not a major news publication like their publishing-conglomerate predecessors and they highlight their use of amateur authors which seems to defeat the purpose of a paid subscription? Interesting content, but not enticing enough for a subscription."

I’m not a techno-phobe. But I read postings on only two sites: Brain Pickings by Maria Popova and Medium. Why? Popova’s site connects literature and philosophy in astounding ways. The graphics on the site, usually from a book under review, are insightful and gorgeous. "
25,KIrkDouglasSD,"January 1, 2019",1,"Please Help! I’ve been paying for this 3 months & I just finally got access on my iPhone/iPad. I couldn’t figure out why it was saying I had 2 articles left each month every time itunes billing showed it had renewed. I finally realized that I needed to “restore purchases.” And i’m not sure why but that fixed it. In the meantime, the last two months I had paid and got nothing but the free articles. ITunes support said I need to reach out to the developer but the developer site has no section for support. 2 out of 3 months that i’ve had this, it has not worked on my iPhone/iPad and i’d like to talk with someone about resolving that or getting a refund. Restoring my purchases seems to have worked but i’m not sure why I had to restore to begin with. Maybe after an update or after getting a new device, i’m not sure. Either way, I love the app but it really stinks i’ve not been able to get support. Please take a moment to reach out to me!!"
26,UberAppleGeek,"April 19, 2019",4,"Love the app....but I really love Medium and the great content it provides! Being able to read so many different points of view on different topics is great! It would get a 5-star rating except that it is annoying that you can't quickly see new posts by people you follow. I wish there were some way that you could just see content from everyone you follow. I like that they don't clog your immediate experience with only those you follow. If I'm missing a way to quickly see content from the writers I follow, please let me know. Otherwise, could you possibly add that feature in with the sidebar menu? "
27,Otdon,"February 17, 2020",5,"Great app with an uncanny way of assigning extremely meaningful reads. This app is not just another read nor your typical book club. This is made from a caring, encouraging, team that I believe genuinely wants to help you grow in all aspects of life. Sure, they tend to discover your interests and provide great reads, but somehow the app locates your inner strengths, motivations, and desires. It provides an inner fuel kindling a slow, comfortable burn to grow as a better person while, helping you live with challenges that could hinder your becoming the great, extraordinary, unique person your destined to become. I highly recommend anyone who wishes to grow holistically in all aspects of their lives to give this super-read app a try."
28,Confoozed,"July 18, 2019",3,"Great community. Not so great app. Medium is home to an enormous population of good writers, many of whom are pros, many more who are not so well known. You can spend hours pouring articles there. And if you forget to bookmark them, good luck trying to find them again. Although Medium is clearly using your reading history to steer you towards articles you might like, you cannot go through that history yourself to find that interesting article on <insert whatever you want here> you read two days ago. "
29,Gettteerrrrr,"September 30, 2019",2,"Content Amazing content. Story after story you will read, digest, learn and grow both professionally and personally. For the most part I focus on design articles, specifically industrial design. I wander into personal improvement articles and come out motivated and a plan on how to improve my lifestyle. "
30,Mohville,"September 28, 2017",4,"Good app, bad comments system There are good reads to be found on Medium (although the new feed has made it a bit harder and confusing to find them.) The comments system, though, is a mess. Often, one has to tap ""show out-of-network responses” to see comments, then tap ""show out-of-network responses” again to see comments to that comment, then repeat if needed. After all that, one may need to tap ""back"" several times just to return to the original article. Not a nice UX!"
31,Mike3292,"November 16, 2017",3,"Great content, decent app The big thing to know about the app is that if you’re reading something and go to another app to do something, and when you come back to Medium it has to be restarted, you’ll lose the article you were reading. Unless you bookmarked it for some reason, there’s literally no way to find it unless you remember the title or author name. This happens fairly frequently and it’s inexplicable that they don’t hook into the iOS API that tells them the app is about to be moved to the background to simply save a reference to the article you’re reading in case the app gets restarted by the OS. "
32,DonDP,"July 20, 2018",5,"Medium has replaced The New Yorker at the top of my “nightstand pile” I make time to read something more-than-just-useful every day. For years, New Yorker magazines have piled up on my nightstand and I always find something engaging inside. There is a thrill stumbling upon an extremely well-written article that takes us somewhere surprising or illuminates a complex issue. In the past weeks, Medium has replaced The New Yorker as my go-to source for that energy.  "
33,Glorrierose,"December 8, 2018",5,"I love Medium as a writer & reader, but.. As someone who is as much concerned with the beauty of how words appear on a page (which is an art in and of itself), I wish there were more options for fonts, column and photo layouts, and other graphics, similar to what's available on blogging platforms like WordPress."
34,Im out here running,"February 15, 2019",5,"My all-time favorite app. The reason I love Medium is because it combines the intellectual diversity of any book you could think of with the comfort of being able to use it on your phone. You can find stories about anything you're interested in. The app tells you how long it should take you to read each article, which comes in handy. The most important trait though, is Medium's personal feel. Some of the posts are written by doctors and therapists, but many are written by normal people who just have something to share. It's nice to hear advice and read about the experiences of everyday people."
35,usha dawn,"April 7, 2019",5,"Amazing platform It’s been a few months since I logged in for the first time, and a couple weeks since I became a paying member. 2 of the best decisions I’ve made for the year so far. I am truly overwhelmed by the nature of what this platform offers to readers, and the number as well as the variety of excellent well written perspectives published on a daily basis."
36,RositaB,"May 13, 2019",5,"Absolutely love it! I love how it’s easy to find topics that you’re most interested in instead of reading through topics that you could care less for. I get a daily email that suggests articles based on my reading history that I can easily click on and bookmark them. Also, if I exit the app in the middle of reading an article, it pops up at the bottom to pick up the exact spot where I last left off. I can also choose to write my own stories and save them as drafts if I need to come back and re-read before publishing it. After publishing, you can still easily read edit and insert quotes or images."
37,Selino,"June 4, 2019",3,"Average writing from enthusiasts rather than experts IMO Most of the articles on this platform appear as summaries of greater works to me. It’s almost a collection of high school and college book reports with very little researched reporting, like a thesis, magazine, or news outlet. Most of the pieces come off as “something I wrote this morning” and not “I’ve been working on this for a year”."

Aside from this, genuine connection amongst people whom have similar interests are then informed of adaptable outcomes on certain topics, or may come up with a different angle of thought all together. It’s really quite a beautiful app, and I thank the creators for establishing an online environment in which the users have somewhat control of the content of interest, as well as the forms of expression portrayed by users that may embed itself in the fabrics of the digital world.

For example, they forced me to download the app because the download this app icon just would not go away, and you know I’ll hit download to make it go away. But I don’t like having this app on my phone. Also, the 5 dollar thing, it’s not that much a month, but it seems like the website is basically unusable without it.

(This is very different from enabling the accessibility feature for visually impaired people on my phone. That adds changes that make things much harder for me.)

I do not know how to contact and notify anyone about the problem. So I am trying a negative review to see if that works. I feel that a large credit is due and I either want to discontinue this app or I want to know how to fix the problem. It seems that under profile there should be some way to do that.

The way the platform is structured to divide revenue to writers, not based on views that generate Ad revenue (because there are no ads) like long drawn out stories and click bait, but rather on how much the reader enjoyed the article, makes almost every read on here super consumable and very helpful! The daily recommendation reads are so good I constantly have a backlog of incredible 2-8 minute reads that I can enjoy and highlight on my commute every day. 10/10 recommend for anyone looking to understand more about life and the world."

I am also unable to or reopen the open the app itself without going through a sign-in process, and that process isn’t just simply entering a password from a keychain, but it requires an email verification step.

I’m not sure how these stories are selected, but I’m guessing it’s based on readership (perhaps a proxy for demand?). There does not seem to be a filter for discovering stories that are free, or a clearly labeled category for them. It’s up to a non-paying user, while perhaps an active participant of the Medium writing community, to locate stories that they can read. At first glance it appears that Medium is a public, free platform that is user-driven, but after some time using the app I discovered that the its pseudo-liberal appearance is just that, an appearance."

But this should not happen to a mature app. I just wanted to read my stories before heading to work and I spent 15 minutes troubleshooting instead. Bah! Come on guys...more testing is required before pushing new releases. iPhone 11 Pro Max."

Also some writers who apparently will not proofread, nor engage a proofreader, and for example, do not know that a hyphen is not the same as a dash (and simply adding a space after a hyphen still doesn’t make it into a dash).

No spin of note; facts that we can check; ideas to keep our brains alive and functioning more optimally.  I for one take daily measures in the care and feeding of my neuroplastic brain, that so far defies aging, thanks to shaking it out of its old grooves continuously, and reading widely like this helps.   The content is always relevant, sometimes ordinary/extraordinary zen,  and never fails to be engaging in Medium’s variance of subject matter alone."

61,Pyeito2,"January 8, 2018",5,"I LOVE MEDIUM!!! You have something important to say, but you may fear that it will inspire an unwanted reaction from someone. The last thing you want right now is a conflict, but not speaking your mind could lead to an internal conflict, and that may be even worse than confronting someone who does not agree with you. If you go into a conversation armed with the words you think are best, and you have a solid strategy, you will feel more confident in delivering your message, and it will be clear. Say what you have to say."

But one thing really bothers me is that once I read something in app, the app start to recommend articles based on what I read before. It’s annoying to see the entire app full of machine learning and data science articles ( I read a few data science articles before). I did set my interested topic in setting. But the content still seems pretty much based on what I read before. I think there are readers like me who want to read diversified content. The recommendation algo simply killed that part in this app."

However I wish it had the ability to share friend links. Every time I’m on social media and want to share a link to my article I have to go to my windows workstation to find that. The only way to work around this is to create a friend link for every article on my workstation and figure out a way to share it to my iPhone.  Frustrating.   But otherwise I love it.

I suppose I’m very used to the web version, the app is a far miss from the functionality and ease of it. No idea why they’d make it different in any way in appearance or function.

76,Einnoc0604,"January 25, 2020",5,"Medium does the best job of curating my content Not sure how Medium determines what content is most relevant based my interests and previous reading, but it does it well. I spend very little time time shifting through articles that match key words based on my interest. Instead most of the articles it list for me are in the right level or niche for my interest. Helps me spend time reading articles full of info I need and less bailing on articles that don’t have what I need."

Thank you for being my new vice."

Unfortunately I can not see myself spending on a subscription because of   an app like this and hope I can find something similar for free.... I appreciate the opportunity to have used it at all though really engaging and interesting topics that are relevant to today’s world without being overwhelmingly political and negative."
80,Unhappy.blah,"November 18, 2017",5,Where have you been all my Life? This site not only entertains it informs and most importantly makes you think about things. It also documents what others are saying so you get an idea of what others think. This is not to say that it's hearsay but that it has been backed up by data. If you are not into data driven ideals then you can pick your interests. It's up to you! You can also contribute your own published content.

I must say this app is amazing!!, and as it says it in the title: a gem mine for readers and writers. It’s amazing and worth getting. I use this every day and the ideas I get from the writers are truly inspiring and worth writing into my personal journal for my own growth and productivity. Definitely worth upgrading and becoming a member. Medium is amazing and I hope to publishing my work here. Keep up the great work!!!!"
82,Contamine,"August 10, 2018",4,"It can go either way... Many writers offer more than they deliver. Some stories are overly long. Others meander off into unimportant details. Often, the writer doesn’t quite support their initial point. Sometimes it isn’t clear what the point even is."
83,Guiseppi Paulino,"September 5, 2018",4,Review First off this is an awesome app. It ha shelled me get over my fear of never being published and some of my favorite writers use it too. So that is an amazing blessing. Also being able to subscribe for the partner program was seamless from my phone. That is where the issue lays. I can publish from my phone but I can make a membership only publication from my phone. That’s a huge drag since o write mostly from my phone. That’s the only reason why it’s not 5/5 stars. Fixing this would be a huge leap.

I love how it has such a variety of articles so there’s always one to help me in whatever I’m going through or feeling in life. Thank you for creating this app!

89,Setu Kathawate,"July 3, 2019",4,"Great app limited by unrealistic restrictions I love Medium. It has helped me learn so many things and it’s my go-to app/website whenever I’m curious. However, the 3 articles/month restriction for certain articles is extremely annoying. Not that I don’t want to pay for good writing, but there has to be a better way of handling those 3 restricted articles. Maybe give me the choice to decide which 3 I read. Otherwise, medium has helped me improve my own writing and share my learnings with the world."

Or create your own mag - it’d have a set layout but you could add or take out articles to flip through offline. I guess like make the book mark section more of magazine part where you could just endlessly flip through everything you saved like a mag.
92,Evan Security Conscious,"December 10, 2018",2,"Destroyed the integrity of premium content Unless medium lets people see the comments on their premium content when they look at such content, they have destroyed their former legitimacy by not showing the comments that argue against a given article in the global quest for truth."
93,Bay Fleming,"January 3, 2019",4,"Great but basic So far the app has been near perfect. No issues, seamless integration. A great community and place to write. However, the mobile version lacks a few key features that the online version has. Viewing revision history or publishing your writing to an actual publication is not available upon the mobile version and can cause a great deal of confusion. Such features would not be incredibly difficult to add and would make the app even better."

I wish more people or companies would focus on more meaningful data and news. I’d surely rather pay 5 bucks a month or whatever for high quality content then waste countless hours searching the web and get nothing but junk.  Thanks to this app for raising the bar. Kudos!
96,PalmParrot,"September 5, 2019",5,"Need method to feed back spell/grammar errors I like the app. It is worth it to pay the annual fee. However, I wish there was a way to quickly feed back spelling or grammar errors to the authors. I'm finding way too many to bother with a reply. Something like selecting the word and clicking on an error icon. Some method like a trust system would be needed to limit abuse, like flooding error messages for someone whose writing you disagree with."

I can easily post my thoughts with my images and quotes.

Unfortunately I’ve noticed unfair censorship taken up twelve notches not only on traditional social media, but now on Medium as well. Conservative articles and speakers are suppressed, if not downright suspended, on the platform in a way that manipulated a reader’s mind in order to push an agenda. I’ll come back if something good happens about the topic, but as along as the devolution of freedom of speech continues on the platform I can’t stay with the app with a clean conscience"

I need more of an RSS feed type of experience from this app where I can more easily browse different categories and quickly access my favorite publishers.

111,ninaz17,"October 12, 2017",5,"Enjoy the content and reading experience Medium is one of my favorite product so far, because of its quality content and relevantly 'quiet' reading experience.

That's not very helpful for highlighting."

Unbiased and accountable for all frames of mind, it appreciates the topics as you will the journey through each article pertaining to your own life."

The frustration lies with the mobile app. I have had more difficulties with it than it’s worth. There have been billing issues, my email account not recognized and I’m unable to post a piece of writing to the group I specifically want to submit to-it only allows me to post to “Public.” I know several other people who have had the same experiences with the mobile app. I even sent an email to the developer to try and figure out the email account and billing issue, but have received no response."
119,KeithPij,"June 25, 2019",4,Need a history feature I would love to see a feature in this app that shows past history. You should also consider implementing a continuous experience.

When you factor that in with the fact that Medium refreshes your feed at will, even if you are in the middle of a story, it’s not even worth opening any longer. Deleted off my phone after having it for years. What a shame."

This is a courage not many have, and it is intoxicating to me. Medium is that friend that always speaks their mind and makes you think before replying. It is my not-at-all guilty pleasure."
128,Krimsonbeats,"June 14, 2019",1,"Pathetic in app payments; their objective is cash, not information This app is absolutely absurd in how quickly they expect you to subscribe, especially considering most of the articles are posted from other sites for absolutely free. You can even see the banners of the embedded articles from third-party sites in the medium articles. I understand how they eventually will cut off free accounts until you upgrade, but so soon? Pathetic."

I love reading about people, hearing stories, life lessons, encouraging words, guided lessons in life/love/business and reading people's perspectives! This App gives all of this and more. The amount of categories individual souls are writing in is super! I find myself lost in writings for hours at a time! Thank you medium-I am learning on so many levels; personal, relational, business and just fun humor!"

It gives a sense of intimacy and closeness I yearn for when I read. Thank you."

But after I set that up, and got the confirmation email from Apple, the paywall banner over the articles won’t go away in the Medium app. Really unfortunate since that makes articles unreadable."

The app is cleanly laid out and I enjoy using it. My only complaint is that the app has disabled the Speak Selection accessibility feature on text. My vision is very poor so I use the iPhone’s text to speech feature on almost every app that I use. I’m not sure why, but this feature is disabled for text in the Medium app."

138,DwittTHE 2nd,"December 5, 2019",1,"Nice app not worth paying $5 a month. I do like the ability this app gives its users to read written pieces by other users, but they have a limit on how many you can read per month before you have to pay a subscription fee to read more. I find that interesting considering all the articles I read daily online on other sites and apps that I use. I don’t see the benefits to paying 5 a month. Unless this is was a revenue stream, and then there are still so many other outlets available for users to promote their own content without paying."
139,CourtMuah,"November 17, 2019",5,"I happily pay $5 a month for the articles!!! They are well written, informative, interesting, and most of all they cover such a wide range of topics!!!

Overall a very great App that I read almost every day!!"

142,C'Raymond,"January 24, 2019",5,"Medium Triumphs over Media How to tame that beast of online media sorcery. That vanquishes all those whose trek, dreads into information overload.  Where Data oceans spew waves upon waves of Yin/Yang  numenati.  Superfluous info tainted in chards and streams on 24/7 infinite loops with little or no value to the conscious observer."
143,Cal Quinn,"May 22, 2019",5,"First app I open everyday, and the last Probably the most fulfilling app on my phone. Part of my morning meditation routine. Opening any news apps become an afterthought from being intellectually and emotionally stimulated by digestible reads (article title tells you ex: “4min read”) from real professionals rather than jaded journalists peppering whatever story came down from AP with rhetoric."

Thank you, Medium."
145,Ghandunagar2014,"February 18, 2020",4,"Add voice based reading abilities Add a button that reads the article or post out loud. That would be great! Perhaps a read later section can auto curate into a podcast like session that reads all the articles and posts you have saved for later. Basically it would proceed to read the title, then the following text. It would then skip to the next saved post. Would be great for commutes, drives, etc."
146,hammermelon,"March 24, 2020",5,"Great subscription app I love Medium.   A great compilation of short, narrowly focused articles that can be easy digested in a few minutes.  The ability to chose a topic that pertains to your interest is sincerely better than having to scrounge for those articles on Google or in hard print.  "
147,songanz,"January 31, 2020",2,"Not a lot of new interesting articles I installed and used the app for several months with subscription. At first, I found my everyday recommended articles interesting. But now and then, I found they are just eye catching, without very useful contents. Like “5 habitats helping you become more effective”, etc. I know this is not a news app, but still I don’t want to read duplicate ideas written by different authors. Therefore, I am leaving this app for now. Really hope that they can find a way for improve their content."
148,Amyhearts,"January 7, 2020",5,Good investment. I enjoy these articles! After 6 months of free reading (limited to 5 articles per month which I tried to stretch out as long as possible...) I finally converted to a paid subscription. I’m always intrigued by the headlines and impressed with the motivational and informative content. $5/month is worth it for ad-free well-written posts. That is all.
149,EmC WV,"November 10, 2019",2,"Make the app fully functional for writers! As a reading app it’s fine. For writers, not so much. I can’t import a story, for instance which should be simple. And I can’t do so on the mobile browser version either, which is ridiculous in this the year of our Lord 2019. Also, series should be viewable in mobile browser- sharing a link on social media for a series gets no engagement because most use mobile for scrolling social media but many don’t have the app and it won’t work in the browser."
150,xStarya,"April 22, 2018",5,Just What I Was Looking For I don’t need all the fancy extras and features of a lot of other sites. I just like to write and I want people to read what I write. I ignored Medium for so long. I was sure it wasn’t right for me. I decided to look again and found out I was wrong. I think this website is brilliant. I love the app as well. I can’t wait to get more into writing on here.
151,Let Your Inner Shine,"April 24, 2018",5,"A different kind of social media I feel like I learn so much from articles on here. Most articles are short and quickly digestible with nuggets of wisdom.

The content so far is outstanding and I love the UX of how articles are queued and categorized. Honestly I also don’t typically write App Store reviews. This is my first in years but felt compelled since I’ve had such a food experience so far with the app. “Hip Hip Hooray” to the product team at Medium. 👌
156,A boy with no name,"August 18, 2019",5,Medium find story so you don’t have to... I love reading about data analytics and science type projects. Seriously what magazine would you buy to fill this void. Medium curates my stories so that every day I can hear amazing stories and how to’s on data projects. I’ve also impressed many of people at work due to tips and tricks that are passively sent every day.
157,MelRNOCN,"June 23, 2019",5,Poor Service. I just cancelled my subscription.  I had upgraded.  Money was removed from my acct on June 9.   I still don’t have access.  The biggest frustration is that I can’t get an answer or even acknowledgement that something is wrong. I have tried many times over the last 2 weeks.  I am ignored. Very poor service.
158,Everpositive,"April 25, 2020",5,"So Thought Provoking I just read that articles are not fact checked. Knowing that process is NOT without errors, I’m ok with that. Mostly Medium is a platform for self expression and dissemination of learning often in the form of realizations. These I find VERY useful, thought provoking and informative. Thank you to all of the participants who write. I value you highly!"
159,Kris P. Kreeme,"February 11, 2020",4,Bug report for Developers (and Review) Thoroughly satisfied with the app. Have written and published a few essays. Only wish that the app UI would be a bit more writer friendly.
160,MIGHTYMEX,"July 12, 2018",3,Excellent app except... I started using Medium on 2016 and I thought it was refreshing to read interesting posts from well educated minds. I was such a huge fan of it that I became a member on 2017 but it has been months that I don’t use the app as much as I used to. The reason why is because the app keeps constantly freezing on me. I sure hope the developers fix this soon. I know it’s the app because all of my other apps work perfectly.

You can’t even give a title to your articles when composing on the app, it doesn’t have the entry area for a title. Also crashes and fails to load all the time. Needs major fixes before it’s reliable, I am forced to access Medium through Chrome and Safari in order to even read articles when this app doesn’t load."
166,Jack_Hill,"April 22, 2020",5,"Solid source of thoughtful information The articles featured in Medium are well thought out, introspective, and approach topics that have legitimate value in most readers’ day-to-day lives.

167,N. Adie,"January 30, 2020",3,"Text editor is kind of wack I use Medium mostly to practice my writing but scrolling down on text is a nightmare on the editor. It suddenly jumps to another part of the text and I get lost while I'm typing. It's hard to select, copy and paste text by tapping on the screen to use the highlight function. It doesn't have the same functions as the web version (adding captions to images, no drop cap option, for example)."
168,LeMastertheMoment,"December 21, 2019",1,No These days anyone and everyone can author an article on virtually any subject.  There are very few that actually contribute to the good of mankind. 99% of Medium simply isn’t worth reading. It’s full of garbage opinion pieces written by young authors rambling on about THEIR experiences that mean absolutely nothing to the vast majority of decent and educated people.  Get over yourself. Get out of yourself.  
169,Texrzrbak,"November 14, 2019",1,"A shell of what it once was Medium used to be a place for serious, aspiring writers. Now it’s a glorified blogging site that fills your feed with mostly left-leaning diatribes for which you have to pay to read. They’ve also changed their algorithms such that your stories are not available to the full audience unless you’re a paying member. They call it their “curator” function, but what it really is is their chance to see if they can make any money off your story. If they don’t think they can, they don’t make it available to the entire audience."

This whole site is another “free preview” type scam to take your money. I’m not even sure if the articles on here are valuable, I can’t read any of them!

It is absurd that Medium would act on this. I am hoping Medium does not continue to develop as a censoring platform. I love most of Medium."

One day I found out that the stories I’d been reading were condensed versions of the originals. The meat of the reads. Medium reminds me of the that. Short but sweet and filling and also a nice chance for the author’s to receive a bit of income for their efforts. Keep up the great work!

I'd love to read an article in peace but it is a blight on the reading experience. To be clear, I don't mind clapping or having a button there some of the time. But don't make it stay there in place the entire time I'm reading. I'm trying to read here!"

216,Midnighters,"July 25, 2019",1,"Seriously? I hate writing this review. I used to tell everyone and anyone about this app and I can’t do that anymore. First when they went to a subscription format I considered it because certain writers I knew to be good were paid content. Now I get notifications for an article that is barely a paragraph and it’s paid for, or another which isn’t written by nearly the same caliber of writer, or even others that are simply linked to a website or a link farm. I’d have to pay for this? "
217,Tyisasexymonster,"February 9, 2020",5,Been on Medium for years. Medium features an outstanding community of writers. It is outstanding! If you want your voice to be heard. If you have something valuable to share. If you’re willing to put the hard work in to create it. Then Medium is the only choice you have IMO.
218,Cachae7,"September 6, 2019",4,Navigation I’ve been away for a year and I noticed that some of the navigation features or not like they used to be so I had to get re-acclimated to the website.

There aren't many apps that have fun and helpful reads that are right at your finger tips. Love the app and is worth the $50 a year or $5 a month.
220,flyWhy,"February 2, 2018",5,"App with Good Content The Medium app is a little hard to navigate on occasion, but that comes from having such a broad selection of content. "

Please fix this problem - it’s been at least several months if not longer."
226,atulya,"March 23, 2019",4,Move Search to Bottom Navigation I love the app and have taken the monthly subscription.

248,rafegoldberg,"January 2, 2020",3,"Good, but... If you like Medium on the web, you’ll like the app. Other than the occasional bug, my only complaint is that the app does NOT reach complete feature parity with its web counterpart. The most annoying example of this is the missing “double-tap to archive” functionality in the app, which I use constantly to manage my saved stories."
249,Frank Panduh,"September 26, 2019",1,"Paywalled for reading barely any content. Paywalled to the point you can barely a handful of quick articles before being funneled into paying for a subscription. Feel bad for bloggers on here getting less reads because free users hit there caps so quickly. They also funnel you into clickbait, short reads so you can get funneled into subscribing. "
250,BiddyBazzle,"October 1, 2017",4,"Tweets no longer rendering in the app This app is a great way to experience Medium on mobile devices. One thing I’ve recently noticed, though, is that tweets have stopped rendering in stories. Instead, their URLs appear as hyperlinks on the page. This is only through the app—it works fine on the actual site."

Why do I get article suggestions in email when it won’t direct to the app when I try to surf to the page? You literally have to search for the title from email in the app.
258,Litfuel,"September 24, 2019",1,"Forced to view propoganda I’m a developer and selected my interests related to development. However, medium forces you to view it’s recommended and editor picks. Now you have no choice to turn it off and it’s not even related to the topics you selected. 9/10 articles are sjw or trump related, all the writers are just random people with no credentials. I wouldn’t care but since i cant turn it off and it takes about half of a page this makes it a non starter for me. Deleted and moved on."

The gem articles are one in a thousand."

While I enjoy the experience  of a simple app to read and browse articles....I did discover that I sorely miss the ability to run a simple search on a word or phrase.

288,Darthus,"February 13, 2020",1,"Broken and won’t fix I love the Medium website. This app, on the iPad 11 (the most modern iPad), crashes every time I hit the sort button. Every...single...time. I’ve reported it, they’ve acknowledged it, and it’s been broken, for months, basically since I started using the app. It makes it incredibly arduous to find articles to read that I’ve bookmarked, which makes the app somewhat useless. Could be great, currently unapologetically broken."
289,JessC Roddd,"January 25, 2020",5,Awesome Recommend The best app on the market for people who love to read and can't always find answers or information on google and other basic search engines. Also very engaging with choices to search preferred topics.

293,Gleepers,"March 8, 2019",2,"An expensive habit I loved the content, at first. Then as I explored further every article I wanted to read required I upgrade ($$).  But they don’t tell you that upfront. Only after you’ve read the first 2 paragraphs of an article and start to scroll on do see see that continuing to read requires an upgrade. Still undecided if it gets the upgrade or is removed entirely. I feel like I’ve been duped."
294,SaralinaTV,"November 4, 2019",5,"Worth it So far I am very satisfied with the picks recommended for me. Very insightful and craftfully chosen for me. It’s worth the monthly subscription. I ended up cancelling another online newspaper subscription bc I felt this brought so much more value to me. Keep it up! Thank you, guys."
295,cocoapuffhead,"October 9, 2019",5,Such amazing app for thoughtful articles on self help and positivity The very first post I read was absolutely amazing. It was so intimate and descriptive of understanding identity I believe so many of us lack. Then it actually explains how to understand how behavior and change it. Such a good app seriously
296,iracecars,"August 7, 2019",1,"Auto-refresh is useless One star. I’d like to read articles on my commute but auto-refresh makes the app useless when you’re on the subway when, eg, you quickly switch between apps to check a txt msg only to lose signal as the train leaves the station and thus losing where you were in the process of reading an article. The app just sits there with the load screen, rendering the entire experience a waste of time."

301,J. Aaron 17,"February 16, 2019",5,The title says it all Medium is the channel by which I do a lot of my marketing-related light reading. It’s a great source of inspiration and thought from industry leaders or those who share a large stake in the field. 
302,Robby1958,"March 4, 2019",3,Is it worth paying for. Most of the stories I have read are about sexuality. The stories are personal and real. I get some hesitant feeling when it keeps telling me I am running out of my free articles. I’m already paying lots to have internet cable phone etc so I am not ready to pay more for content.
303,N!k0l3,"March 28, 2019",1,Worse app for crashing on my phone I love medium but your app is terrible. You can scroll and bookmark 3 or 4 stories and then it freezes for minutes or needs a reboot. I can only read a story part way through and same thing. The only app I have ever had that dose this and so noticeably badly. Fix your load times and the freezing issue.

447,Harrison0909,"October 9, 2019",1,"Okay branding. Mediocre content infrastructure. Great eye catching app here, aiming for the “smart” information consumer. But please don’t tell people this is free. After just a few articles you have to upgrade to a premium account. The articles in my opinion aren’t worth that. Stick to other news sites and don’t pay to have some app filter through meaningless article after article."
448,Chairman of the Board,"October 3, 2019",2,"It was good the way it was Many of the added features are beginning to make this app heavy, they weren’t needed, it was perfect before the most recent update.

I just tried to select a whole response I wrote but it will only select one paragraph at a time. Unacceptable.

463,wuz2blu,"August 4, 2018",1,"Great idea, be prepared to pay This app has fun, enlightening editorial articles. It was a blast (at first) to use. The problem is, they only allow you to read three articles before they demand and require you to “upgrade” (pay) to continue using it. Really? Three articles? And the message you get is ridiculous: “You read a lot. Please upgrade to continue....”"

Immature writers This may be innovative and insightful if one is a high school student or immature college student but the majority of revelations and writings by the repeat writers are sad in their lack of insight and depth.

847,suicidalQ,"February 20, 2020",5,"I love to read thanks to medium I enjoy medium so much. I appreciate the arts deeply. As a youth I never liked to read. Thanks to the platform provided by medium. That has changed. It’s true I was reading for the wrong reasons at first. It was strictly looking for her good bye and to catch her communication with her new man. Then the concept of regular people writing articles started growing on me. Because my passion for independent underground hip hop. Is rooted in the same idealism. Regular people making art for the love it. No big record deals no promise of getting rich. Pure passion and maybe one day growing a fan base that allows these type of artist to quit their day jobs. Honestly I still look for a story,she being this women I fell in love with. may write directly to me giving me closure. Maybe a letter directly to me helping me gain control of my mental issues. From the hacker or whom ever saying, Questor this is some kind of intervention your not crazy. But the fact is even how ugly my reasons. Maybe paranoia maybe a kid that hated to read is reading. I don’t try to store the stuff I read fully just little bits. Cuz other things in my mind need to stay in the foreground. But I read and for that I thank you. I may not ever get who ever to stop hiding behind the keyboard. I may one day get serious and use this as the platform for my life story. Cuz the collectives little game won’t stop. So I can’t focus on my dreams or goals. Better yet I just don’t focus on them. Even when I read hints that say that’s what people want. Mean  Need to reclaim my self through arts. Everything is on hold as far as those things go. Till people grow balls to easy my mind. I will keep reading and stay a fan"

The community is surprisingly studious, curious, and open-minded compared to most other internet comment sections, and the estimated read-time at the top of every article and comment has surely spoiled me (I really notice the absence of this lovely feature when reading elsewhere). But the platform desperately needs at least a couple of important tweaks."
1112,creativeonion,"April 7, 2018",2,"Brilliant platform; too much gatekeeping and not enough $ I’ve been a writer on Medium for over two years, and have always loved both the functionality and the community of dedicated critical thinkers and writers. Unfortunately, Medium has neglected its creative writing community, favoring current news, creative self-help, and identity politics above other genres, and burying the countless brilliant poets and fiction writers. Medium has also allowed its fantastic publication features to atrophe, to the extent of removing the ability to use custom domains. Instead, Ev has invested in bringing NYT, CNN, Bloomberg, Atlantic, and other left-leaning mainstream publications in, which the platform pushes aggressively in newsfeeds, pushing unique native Medium writers’ content into more obscure corners of the platform."

1130,3 And a Half Ideas,"October 31, 2014",3,"I LOVE Medium, but this app is missing some things. Medium is great, I love using this app to read in, but it is lacking some critical features. You should be able to do more than swipe through your reading list. You should be able to view 'Top Stories' and 'Staff Picks.' A search feature should really be added. And it would be nice if I could scroll through articles, and choose which ones I read, rather than just having some placed in front of me. You should also to be read horizontally in iPad. I wish you could recommend an article without leaving a comment. You should also be able to add comments, like you can do in a browser. A write feature would be great too, but I would expect that to be released in a whole other app."
1131,ktnvd,"January 4, 2015",2,"No swipe kills my flow The content rocks. Navigating it (the app's purpose) is frustrating in this version. I'm reading a great piece lying on my side and when ready to move to the next one, I swipe... Left, right, up, down. Nothing. I begrudgingly swipe all the way up and finally see the back arrow at the top. I seriously hesitate to shift my whole weight so I can reach it (and I've got an iPhone 5, less of a stretch than newer models). I figure out that a tap anywhere will clumsily (it feels hit or miss) bring up a header with the back arrow, saving me the scrolling all the way up, but the issue remains that I can't reach it without shifting my whole hand position and likely my body when in chilled out long form reading mode. And then even if I could, why do I have to go back? There should be a way to just keep flowing through content. Medium should take a page out of Paper (Facebook's app) which has stellar interaction design by contrast, near all of which would work so well for the kind of reading experience Medium ought to be when using its own app. And no search? Much more forgivable, but another piece left to be desired."
1132,Astro947,"December 25, 2015",3,"Great website, bad navigation in comments (Full disclaimer: if you haven't read anything on Medium before and want to see some of the most well-written free content on the App Store, download this app immediately.

1133,C_CUBED,"March 2, 2016",5,"Medium is the perfect medium True. At times I spend more than a medium amount of my time in the app. Sometimes sucked into an obsessive, veritable Medium marathon. I've learned though moderate. Bookmarking items for later reads; picking one person I follow to focus on for my Medium fix; scaling my reads down to only the ones I receive notifications for. "
1134,Sherman P,"July 22, 2016",5,"Perfect Blogging Platform I recently just got into reading blogs and after searching around and finding independent websites, I found a few that I liked. But when a friend introduced me to Medium, I was hooked. They set up suggestions for blogs to follow based on what you put in that you like, then they have updates each day on a ""for you"" tab so you can read what interests you most. There is also an editor's pick tab which is also interesting to read every now and then to broaden your horizons. I started a blog as well and the thing I love most about this is that I have heard stories of first-time users getting rocketed to the top of the editor's list because of their good writing (some of it is even FICTION). So, this gives me some hope!"
1135,EdEastridge,"August 6, 2016",5,"Welcome Back, Mr. Review we've missssed you. On top of a quick blogging interface, we'd been treated for a decent amount of time with people developing the software being as nerdy and witty as the software's users. So, not only have you a blogging platform with an easy to reach audience, you also have quick turnaround in trouncing bugs and a note of humour every now and again in the update description. With personal resignation, I'd seen that the documentation team had been sacked in favour of someone who would just write in what was changed and what the change dealt with, loathe to see yet another creative flame extinguished in the name of brief, concise information.

Troll ABC News as a Fox News kinda guy, and you'll be supported by all the other outraged Fox News guys who clicked on the viral FB post, with nary a ABC News watcher reading, because they watched the segment live, and didn't give it a second thought.  NOT HERE PEOPLE!  This place is the real deal, octagon of minds with challengers ready to destroy you for disagreeing!

Still being among the digitally shackled to more vacantly gratifying social media outlets (Facebook, Snapchat), I just didn't find it that appealing. But after seeing how much the user interface facilitates the process of writing, editing, and publishing, I was hooked. And I know this sounds like an infomercial- but I promise it's not (though I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of siphoning some money from Medium-promotion lol). "
1140,Johnny Garlic,"June 8, 2014",1,"Fail When you first install this web browser (let's face it, that's all it is; calling it an app is like calling a lemonade stand a restaurant) the first piece that appears is from the founder or CEO or someone. Like the father of a kid who just QB'd his team to a super bowl victory, he waxes proudly about bringing up Medium, the challenges, the milestones, the hope, the dreams, and ultimately the payoff-- which he clearly leads us to believe is a monumental achievement of some sort.  The needle scratches off the record and reality hits. After a few minutes with Medium you realize his dad was fantasizing , and the kid is still in high school. Not only that, he's not even on the starting team. In fact, he's just a water boy whose overprotective mama won't let him tilt to landscape, look at his own diary, or write his girlfriend a love letter. You've been duped. You write Papa Medium a one star note and quickly remove him from your phone. You wish you could have those 20 minutes back."

When I click on any link from the Medium website or an email, it never opens in the app, I am just sent to the App Store. Also, I cannot see notes or my own recommendations within the app. Please fix this problem or include these features if they are not already built into the app. Lastly, I do not own a PC, only my iPad.

Most of the articles turn out to be interesting and informative reads too. The core of the app's structure is great! The problem I have with it though is that when clicking on articles on my feed, or in my bookmarks, or wherever, sometimes I can open the article and other times I have to back completely out of the app to try and see if a second try clicking on the article will open the app. This is very time consuming and is a total drag.

The only way of describing Medium is an app loaded with self experiences, professional views, and just overall ""a news app taken through a nonsense filter"" rather than news articles that feel biased. Using Medium I feel like I had just entered a new world. There are always topics to engage you, help you, and keeping your sense of wonder strong. I came to Medium looking for articles of self help and work life balance. Eventually, I became content with a desire to educate myself more than I have ever felt; and not educate myself because I wanted something specific, but more and more wanting to learn for the sole purpose of self growth."

Since I can't do that, I often don't open the first story that intrigues me so I don't get sucked in, and I hate that because I know I'm missing out.  I do have one suggestion... When I scroll through the first few articles that come up, I ALWAYS think, ok I'll read this one first and then I REALLY want to be sure and read that one even if that's all I have time for right now... But then you trick me and make me scroll through 29 more articles to again find the ONE other article I really wanted to read. Please don't do that anymore."
1149,RVCIV,"April 5, 2017",5,"A Bubble But A Good One I love Medium for many reasons. Not the least of which is the ""bubble"" of topics that you can create. Allowing for scrolling that doesn't come with the anxiety or boredom that unfiltered timelines can bring. I'm not avoiding things I don't agree with, I'm just making sure that when I'm looking thru content, with limited time, I find something worth reading quickly. Medium is filled with wonderful content creators, writing about a wealth of topics I am interested in (culture,development,design), and I can squeeze in some reading in the limited time I have, not only because of the high quality content but also the filtering system and the wonderfully simple interface."

Reading articles has never been simpler, and with an estimation of how long each article will take to read it allows you to find something to fill those brief periods of time we all covet. While it lacks the customizability of picking genres to read that competitors like Flipboard have, I've enjoyed the articles it chose for me far more than anything I've read on competing apps. Medium is the best app out there for finding and reading content tailor specific for the user and I highly recommend it."

But Medium truly welcomes writers of all fan base sizes and walks of life to exercise their free speech, publish their thoughts and gather a following strictly based on keyword and tag searches. It's great for an aspiring writer like myself and it's completely free! If you'd like to become completely ad-free, you can pay the $5 per month.

Social features include ability to clap for quality work, to follow favorite authors, and to provide comments. The most powerful and unique feature may be its highlight capability, where readers can highlight favorite passages, and even comment on them. Medium's app isn't perfect, and it's still evolving.

Comments may be attached to any paragraph, sentence or phrase, also curated it seems, and the reader elects to peruse them or not, to add one's own or not.

One key tips is to ""follow"" a user who writes or recommends content that interests you. I also recommend doing the same is someone outside of the areas you are familiar with. I hope this endeavor continues to survive and grow. Good luck Biz!"

I commented on an article about what the National Spelling Bee has evolved into and it was posted just as if it were another article and stayed on the list for a number of days. The app is user-friendly and it has never crashed on me. Put it on your device and you will never be stuck in the dentist's office stuck with the choice of reading about Kardashians in People or watching the looping video on teeth whitening. You can be improving your mind.

I can be immersed for hours in fantastic literature ranging from comedic personifications of movie sharks and in depth analysis of astrophysical questions to music reviews and political commentary. The new feed takes this experience and removes a vital part of what makes this app unique; it organizes into categories. The mixed feed allowed me to continually find something new. I've switched back to the old homepage but I worry that they may remove that option sometime. Please don't. Honestly this is an amazing format to read from but I leave it at three stars because I want them to see it.

The organization of the site is very intuitive and has been spot on with finding new writers and articles that I find relevant. The emails are also great for this, and I love the little feature of giving an ETA for each read. It's nice to have for times when I don't necessarily have 15 mins to read an article- the next one that pops up is only 5. It makes it very doable to stay up to date with interesting information and with a solid community of writers."

This way, medium will become stickier to users."

1198,græy,"August 21, 2017",1,Worse than going through the browser The whole point of a dedicated app is to improve the experience versus using the site in a web browser.  Or at least that's what I think...apparently the folks at Medium don't agree.
1199,williamfrazr,"September 26, 2017",5,"I Started My Writing Career With Medium Thanks to Medium, I have developed a writing career over the past two years after writing almost every day. It combines simple tools for drafting, publishing, and sharing your work with others. Now that is has integrated a model for monetization, I see it as a viable platform for writers at any stage of their career. Medium is one of the few companies I could actually see myself working for because of my belief in the product and mission. Looking forward to a future with Medium!"
1200,daroross,"March 21, 2014",2,"It's a start I feel bad rating a 1.0 release so low, but this is basically a pretty reading app. After a few minutes, I realized that I wasn't able to write stories here. I also quickly realized that any medium links I clicked or opened from other apps (email, twitter, safari) went to the web version in safari without any option to open them in the app. I like apps to be hubs of activity on the iPhone, so the fact that I can't use this app as a hub for medium yet means it'll sit in a folder for a few updates (at least until writing in the app is an option). It's a start, but the race is far from over."
1201,Jessrachael,"March 24, 2014",5,"Beautiful app The app is beautifully designed and is for the most part very easy to use. Excellent (of course) for reading. I almost wish there were a way to navigate through collections other than a story at a time, but that might ruin the simplicity. I also don't think the ability to write in the app is necessary. Maybe it's just my writing process, but I would find it impossible to compose anything long on an iPhone."
1202,Aswalters519,"August 30, 2014",1,"I give up. It's like having a 3,000 page magazine which in order to get to the article you want to read, you have to swipe one page at a time to get to it. I get emails that tell me about interesting articles, and so far, I can only find them online. A homepage would be a simple fix to find those newly published articles, but they say, ""Rather than bog you down with a homepage, we want to get you right into discovering the stories that matter to you,"" which to me, means, ""Too much work. We don't feel like it."" How can I get to the stories that matter to me if I can't get to the stories that matter to me?! Once they fix this, I will use the app all the time. For now, use the internet."
1203,Dancin Forever,"September 3, 2014",5,"great for discovery at first, I was a bit surprised at the bad reviews. Medium is out to provide a completely different reading experience.  I found it flawless in just swiping left through articles looking for interesting ones to read. so simple, it didn't matter who I follow, what's in my reading list - just read & swipe right every so often to get back to a collection, for example. it surprisingly works. Can't wait for an editor this simple."
1204,MahdiPOnline,"November 24, 2014",4,"Awesome for reading, and that's it First of all thanks for the list. The cover to cover scrolling was such a pain. But you forgot something and that's the back button! Imagine that you're done reading a 15 min long article and then you realize you have to scroll all the way up again ti see the exit button!"
1205,Rlg512,"June 4, 2016",5,"Great reads, any time of day. The only reason why I originally downloaded this app was because of David Shoemaker. But thanks to him and his article, I have come to love this app! Every day there are brand new articles that are very accurate on what I like, and the way you can comment is so easy! And highlights are just as important because you can comment on just the highlight and people will still be able to see what quote you were talking about. Great app all around."
1206,Sandepantz,"September 27, 2016",5,"Excellent for Writers & Readers I signed up for Medium before its formal launch because the design blew me away. Neat, uncluttered and just enough formatting options make it ideal for someone who wants to write but not make myriad decisions about look and color. I've become a voracious reader on Medium in the last 6 months. As a 90s kid if the blogosphere was too unstructured for you, you'll doubly appreciate the swiftness of Medium in finding great, great content. Quality writing and UX have kept it the no.1 app on my list for a while."
1207,Jeterfan3,"April 9, 2017",5,"I'm addicted I downloaded medium a few months ago as something to browse while sitting on the toilet (a feeble attempt to feel more productive). Here I am, two months later, still sitting on the toilet devouring medium articles left and right. Ten minutes turns into an hour and a half rather quickly. Although it may be difficult to stand up after, the articles and time spent reading them are worth it. Can't recommend this app enough"
1208,mjf22608,"May 13, 2017",4,"Good channel; needs better navigation I really like Medium. It provides a channel for intelligent commentary that is (1) outside the echo chambers of most mass media, (2) higher quality than most social media screeds, and (3) flexible in length and media files. I would like to see more control over how to find new stories. A most recent sort function would be most helpful. I would also like a ""readers of this also read..."" feature. I keep following new authors but every time I log in I seem to land in the same place."
1209,Audiebert,"May 16, 2017",4,"Delicious freedom Medium is the one place I've felt the most free to say what I'm thinking and/or feeling in a long while. While Barack was president I had to be politically correct. During Trump's tenure I've had to be conservative-VERY conservative. But on Medium I can say what I like and take the ""up yourses"" and the ""I love yous"" with casual grace or disproportionate anger - it's my choice."
1210,bmc atx,"April 10, 2014",3,"Beautiful UI, difficult to use This really is a gorgeous app to read articles from one of the better sites out there. However, the app has no navigation and no ability to filter by subjects or search for articles. "
1211,Gabriel de la Mora,"October 10, 2015",4,"Needs Improvement The app is good enough but that's it. There are numerous things that are unavailable or hard to find. For one, bookmarks are way too hard to get to. Another thing is after starting a draft of some sort it seems impossible to be able to delete it. Finally, there's no way to edit the publications that one follows or even see the individual writers that one follows. Please add these things to the app because they are getting in the way of a pleasant experience."
1212,Ailurophile23,"March 9, 2016",4,"Great app, with a few small issues This is a great app! It’s convenient for reading Medium posts on the go. However, the lack of support for landscape orientation makes it harder to write comfortably, in my opinion. Also, it took a bit of time to figure out how to view all my stories ― even thought it’s easy once you figure it out (tap on “You” and then on “View profile”), it’s not very clear for someone who hasn’t used the app before. These are just minor quibbles, though ― mostly, the app is great."
1213,Blc2000,"April 24, 2016",5,"Every time I open this app ... Every time I open this app, I find myself engaged. The writing, reporting and opinions always seem interesting and seemingly connect to me. It's also nice not having to wait for ads, photos, a video player, Tweets and other embeddables to load. The content is rich. I don't have time right now to come here once a day, but when I do find the time, it's always a positive experience. I also tend to share a lot of stories."
1214,Desiree111,"April 30, 2016",5,"Refreshing I enjoy reading the content in this app as it is engaging, earnestly thought inducing, and full of meaningful reading from people of all walks of life."
1215,ocvw,"February 1, 2017",4,"Nice App, anti-intellectual service I've enjoyed Medium for a while now. It's overall a thoughtful community of writers. There's everything from useful to beautiful and inspiring content to be found there. The app is very usable. "
1216,Chili Barrel,"May 30, 2017",3,"Removed features The latest release was a disappointment for my usage. I follow certain publications. On the previous version, updates to those publications were front and center when I loaded the app. Now they're harder to find. After launching the app a few times and poking around, I eventually found out how to get to what I wanted in a few taps. I'm bummed it's not front and center anymore. "
1217,Tonyb0312,"June 7, 2017",5,"Replaced my Facebook Addiction! I found myself sinking into an endless cycle of opening Facebook anytime I had some downtime or was bored. It was empty, meaningless consumption. Medium answered my needs by providing a ton of content in an elegant, easy to use app. Now, instead of throwing time away, I'm learning about things like JavaScript, programming and other tech stuff with way more substance. Sorry friends, don't care that you got another cat pic - I just learned how to use Git commands!"
1218,Adorei! Super útil,"June 8, 2017",5,"Best content ever This is by far my favorite app of all times. I don't even feel guilty anymore procrastinating when I'm reading Medium. People who I recommend it to love me for that. My only concern at this moment is the membership thing - $5 isn't that much if you're living in the US, but in my case that'd become almost $20 (in my country's currency) which is not a attractive option. Not really sure what I can have with the free version of Medium now, let's see."
1219,buddywinston,"June 13, 2017",5,"Inspiration comes in small doses... I notice more often that when I first check into my online ""life,"" I dip my toe into the day by reading a few of the pieces published here. I pick 2 or 3 topics (only,) of what grabs my attention on any given day. The read time notation reminds me short reads work best (for me.) Inspiration - in small doses, follows. My day becomes more focused, hence more productive. And my attention span for tasks actually Increases. Happiness follows. I take what I can get. Small doses."
1220,KLpz1,"March 22, 2014",3,"Bug on sharing I believe there's a small bug in the sharing feature. I'm logged on medium app with my personal twitter account but I have a business account also logged in my iPhone. When I click share it does show me a field to choose an account but it's not populated. In similar app, all I have to do is tap the preferred account and proceed. Here I can not do that. If I force it to share anyway it looks like I had been shared (show me the article title and user @ in the intent) but nothing is actually posted to none of my accounts."
1221,farmersjt,"October 5, 2015",5,"Love Medium! I have recently started reading Medium daily. I signed up for the email recommendations, and it's easy to get caught up going from story to story on various topics. The app itself needs some minor tweaks but nothing substantial. Full edit capability of one's profile would be nice. There are so many topics to choose from, everyone can find something to enjoy. I use Medium in conjunction with Twitter and Periscope. It's the perfect antidote to the mindless Facebook/Instagram zombie hegemony. Good luck."
1222,NikeAirMan,"October 7, 2015",5,"Love it Whether you're just killing a few minutes time, or looking in to a topic you can spend longer in, this app has it. Never mind the always entertaining comments from the folks at Medium about new updates when they arrive. But I've spent countless hours reading through the pieces on here, and I love it. Have recommended it to a couple dozen people, and will keep recommending it to more. To you at Medium, keep up the great work!"
1223,BranMuffin100,"November 30, 2015",5,"Surprisingly Sophisticated It is surprising how unique and fresh Medium is compared to any other social network.  The absence of clickbait and the the amount of substance that writers put into their work is unparalleled, again, compared to other social networks.  Even the comment sections are filled with, believe it or not, many insightful critiques.  This is the closest any company, in my opinion, has gotten to integrating technology with meaningful discussion, and so far, it has worked incredibly well."

Backus,"February 2, 2016",5,"Progressive God Send I am thankful a place like this exists and what I mean is the original intent is beautiful as long as they don't go public and get wedged out by the board bc I now post all my knowledge on ..hmmfb and obviously not for the likes..

What I mainly enjoy is reading lots of inspirational content and writing my own posts from time to time. Sometimes it feels like I can spend my whole life's existence reading on here since there's so much good content it offers. I highly recommend that readers and writers of all kinds give this platform a chance."

1228,saigems85,"April 18, 2017",5,"Love it! I not only enjoy the content, but I also appreciate the fact that they say about how long of a read each post is. This helps immensely because sometimes I only have a few minutes during which to read so I can pick and choose which articles I read versus having to quit in the middle of one and go back later. If I see one I want to read but don't have the time, I can bookmark it."
1229,Ndonarski,"August 9, 2017",5,"Great platform I use Medium first thing in the morning and throughout the day, it gets me in touch with great ideas every day. The articles are insightful, provocative and timely. Most are 3-5 minute reads. Most importantly it makes me look smart and insightful to my family and friends! I highly recommend the app and I highly recommend supporting it financially, it's worth the monthly subscription more than a lot of other things I subscribe to!"
1230,junesix,"October 18, 2015",5,"Some instability but excellent! I had deleted the old Medium app. I don't remember what it looked like, only that it felt like a worse experience than Medium on Mobile Safari. No longer - it's a first class citizen, optimized for reading, tracking following content, and writing cogent responses. Occasionally the transitions between areas is not smooth and I've had a crash. But overall a great revamp and reimagining for mobile. Kudos to the team!"
1231,Mailee029,"February 12, 2016",5,"Thumbs up for release notes Yes yes the app is awesome! But this review is specifically for the person that writes the release notes here. Is this person an alum of Comedy Central / family guy writer club?  Whether these release notes were created by accident or a result of deep product / marketing brainstorming session ... Whatever the reason, It's brilliant. I have automatic updates for all"
1232,SheWhoCanWrite,"April 19, 2016",4,"Love Medium, but it needs some help My chief complaint is that the app won't allow me to edit my publication. That's a major pain in the bum, as I do a majority of reading & writing on the app. I also have run into a number of complications with adding embeds to stories; I have not once successfully done that. I am techno-stupid, without question, and the app and site are probably as user-friendly as anyone can make it, at this point. But again: chief complaint? No editing feature on the app for pubs."
1233,Bookitmama,"August 15, 2016",3,"Lots of fun but problems with interface Medium, generally, is lots of fun.  My brain collects all kinds of info- - trivial and otherwise. Medium is a great place for relaxing or challenging reads, or anything in between. I'm glad to see writers of all levels represented, from those beginning to those established. App easy to use.  However, much of the editing software does not work on the iOS platform (I have an iPad Pro).  It's particularly unhelpful when writing poetry, where spacing and stanzas are so important for the overall flow.  It appears to be great for prose, however."
1234,Otto_Bhat,"February 8, 2017",5,"I don't write reviews The app is solid and performs well. The best parts are intrinsic to the Medium platform and the wonderful content contributors- the platform indicates how long a read any given article might be, which is pretty awesome. In using other News and Social Media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Google News...etc.) we seem to be bombarded by junk articles, incoherent opinions and ad sites; With Medium, I can explore content without the fluff or vitriol encountered elsewhere. I love Medium."
1235,meimeye,"February 10, 2017",5,Removed all my barriers What's the best way to get my ideas out of my head? How should I format it? How do I make the images I use look good? How do I get people to read what I share? These were the questions that for years were keeping me from sharing my stories with the world. Medium answered them all in an instant. Finding Medium was like opening the floodgates so the ideas backed up in my head could rush out into the world.
1236,51yo democrat/psychiatrist,"August 5, 2017",5,"A multitude of voices My rating is 4 not 5 stars because the quality of some of the writing (I'm including my assessment of the content not just the style here) is uneven. However, the breadth of topics covered, the ability to choose your interests in order to limit the quantity of the pieces from completely overwhelming, and the interesting voices of people beyond what is chosen by editors of a magazine or newspaper make Medium fascinating and well worth the purchase price."
1237,IAMNartgirl,"August 26, 2017",5,"Get Lost!! (And Found!) Medium is the perfect place to lose yourself, wandering from entry to entry, which can range from thoughtful to humorous, heartfelt, informative and nostalgic. Spend even a little time here and you may be reading entries in topics you didn't realize would interest you! You will also find parts of yourself in Medium's authors, maybe in a story or phrase that connects with a memory or feeling you've yet to express. Get to reading! Enjoy!"

I read her posts on my ferry to work, inspired each day, and I find myself venturing into others' posts, happily meandering across tidbits of wisdom and adventurous stories of love, life, loss and perseverance. Five stars."
1239,Carolina de Allende,"October 19, 2017",5,"Clean and simple. Reading material is Medium's stock in trade. There is a lot of it on the site and little of it is completely stupid. Five stars for that. It would be hard to provide a bird's eye view of all those words, so though it lacks that desirable feature, I won't fault the app for not offering one. I hope they give it a shot in the further, though. Meanwhile the ads are ignorable and the pages are clean and simple. Reading is allowed."
1240,BryceofLife,"January 22, 2015",5,"(Was) Perfect for reading - return the swipe! Medium on the web has quickly been one of my most frequented sites. The site is so unobtrusive and I only notice the content. This app does exactly that. Immediately jump into reading and swipe between stories. You can also see how long the rest of the story will take and if you get tired of it, bookmark the story and swipe to the next. "

Most recently I have been using an iPad Air 2 paired with a bluetooth keyboard case to write various things emails, stories, posts onto various internet forums among other things. Now I thought to myself, I should try the Medium App to post some of my stories to the internet to share with friends/family as well as anyone else who might be interested in my ramblings....now the app itself is actually very good for browsing and reading other posts how ever...why on earth does this app not support landscape mode? Please...fix this."
1243,Sky Winston,"October 8, 2015",5,"Realizing one of the webs original dreams Medium has built an incredibly polished place to share your ideas and discover the thoughts of others.  They went further though by allowing you to annotate your thoughts and the thoughts of others, by inviting people into your conversation, and by showing a genuine concern for how their tool will feel to use.  It makes me happy when I click a link on the web and land on a medium story."
1244,Damonlee,"October 14, 2015",5,Love the update except... I love how far Medium has come. I remember reading about it right as it came out and I signed up right away. The community you have built has never failed to expand my mind and perspective.
1245,Nick Levi Kelly,"November 11, 2015",5,"A place for thought Medium is my favorite place to read short and long form stories. There is definitely a bias toward a particular type of content (caused by the users, not by Medium) but if you spend the time to look around you'll find amazing stories all over the place. Medium also runs a few different publishing teams that are constantly producing rich content. Get on here and get reading! And thinking."
1246,Teedang1,"November 14, 2015",5,"Exceptionally Stimulating This app is a great medium to read content that is raw, insightful and really personable. Many content on other sites are curated or biased. I believe Medium is an app for minimal is and millennials searching for content that really pertains or resonates with them. I find myself on it when I need a piece of mind, to wind down and get lost in enlightening content. You can follow authors you find are similar to you or understand what you're going through."
1247,Ade Shemsu,"December 18, 2015",5,"Amazing App It's the social media app where I feel that I am surrounded by other intellectuals, thinkers, entrepreneurs, creatives, etc. uninhibited by the ignorance and silliness of some of the other sites. Everyone here just wants to learn, to teach, and to share their ideas and I think it's amazing. Definitely would recommend to those of you who aspire to be anything beyond the normalcy of mediocrity because everyone here wants more from their lives too!"
1248,Kiri Chairo,"May 18, 2016",5,"If you like to read If you like to see things through some else's eyes, if you want to know what is new and interesting in the areas that interest you- this is the app. It is easy to set preferences, the topics you select as your areas of interest are neatly divided at the top, so you can either scroll through the ""For You"" tab and see what strikes a chord, or you can pick from one of the topics you chose."
1249,fbara,"August 17, 2016",2,"Bad release notes & prompts for notifications I like the general layout of the app and, of course, the articles.

1250,B town baller,"October 15, 2014",3,"Good app, needs more I love the randomness of the app and how you never know what type of article you are going to get. However the fact that I cannot write from the app or see specific categories of articles makes me really wish there was more. I believe there needs to be a way to look at categories of articles and a way to actually view bookmarks and specific writers and actually write from the app. Other than that, this app has the potential to become a huge social media success"
1251,Yuzzur,"November 12, 2014",2,"could use some work While the website is fantastic, the app could use some work. First would be to remove the 'intro to medium on iOS' article that shows up every time I open up the app. Obviously unnecessary after the first time using the app. Second, and most importantly, would be to have the app actually refresh with new articles every time I open the app. Currently, it doesn't do this, or if it does, it does it very infrequently. If these problems were to be fixed, I think this app would be great as there are amazing articles waiting to be read."

Its not a ""social media"" app, it is more than a News app (as its categorized). It is a reading platform all on its own. Allowing others to share and read stories. A live book that forever updates and change narratives. To me, it is a gateway to many different takes on life, culture, and so much more. Thank You Medium!!!"

Which led to me reading another post..& another and now.. Every evening i unwind with a few good reads.  The app runs smooth and is refreshingly simple .  I dont have time for reading big 3 inch novels.   But 5-10 min here n there is great.  Be it something creative, inspiring, imaginative, or uplifting that you are looking for.. You will find it on medium ."

I read this very morning for at least 15 minutes. Love it!"
1259,ReadingDecibels,"April 30, 2017",2,"This is a review of the app, not those who utilize it Four stars because you cannot report users or adjust their influence on your Medium feeds unless you open your browser and do so from there. The app itself has a great user interface, and the platform itself shines on mobile for this reason. It also does its job without crashing, without upsetting the flow of the user, and without sending you to the website like many apps do. Note to programmers, sending me to the website doesn't justify an app's necessity. Amazingly, I can do that myself without an app."

Really? Medium took away my ability on mobile to select ""show less stories like this""? It's hard enough getting the feed to display content I do actually care about (can't I follow politics WITHOUT seeing 20 thinkpieces on Trump?), now on mobile it's impossible unless I systematically block every single user who creates stuff I don't want to see, and that's not fair to them."
1266,-LOL,"December 17, 2016",5,Love Love the app and the site itself. It's a community of not only great thinkers but great writers who have insightful knowledge about pretty much ANYTHING in life. I've used so many news source apps to find people's discussions about news or life but nothing tops this place. Ive only had the app for about a week or two and I've learned so much. Thank you to the developers and to the contributors of this website. I'm very grateful.
1267,_jgibbster,"June 1, 2017",4,"A well-handled overhaul I'm not a huge fan of the new homepage, mostly because I like having easy access to my publications, though I can see why they want to change it. Publications like the Ringer are the main thing I read on Medium, so I appreciated that they gave me a chance to go back to the old layout and offer some feedback on why I went back. Shows they care about getting this update right. Big thumbs up to this team!"
1268,Her Hi-nes,"August 11, 2017",5,"Always something good to read Medium, to me, is like a book of short stories--there's always something good to read. I love the diversity of writers as well as the material they write about. Sometimes I'll read some subject I know nothing about just to learn about it. "
1269,Apbuser,"September 5, 2017",4,"Almost Although a great source of varied opinion and curated thought, it tends to be yet another haven for adult babies. If/when kept to a debate about the topic at hand, good intellectual discourse occurs. But too often I read something (not within the Politics category) only to find some sort of anti-Trump message contained or someone provides an opinion spewing hatred for the President. Its a sad (and telling) state of affairs when there is no place for conservatives to have rigorous intellectual debate."
1270,fish2004,"April 16, 2014",3,"Pretty but missing some key pieces Medium, the website is one of my daily reads. I love the variety of articles and the ease with which I can work my way through them. That is exactly what is missing here. In order to be as usable as the site, this app needs category browsing, access to my bookmarks, and the like. "
1271,Verbose Boss,"August 19, 2015",5,"Best Articles Ever They cull the net for current pieces, then let you know how long it will take to read each one. This is really handy, because I lose all sense of time when I read, even though I am a fast reader. You can also pick a category that interests you: human, tech, science, etc. That's what first drew me in. There is so much to choose from that I STILL lose track of time reading."
1272,TeresaE09,"October 12, 2015",4,Love the new interface except... I really wish bookmarks were easier to locate. I bookmark articles to reference quickly and locating them more than halfway down the search page and then being sent to yet another page is clunky and frustrating. The former set up was perfect! I do enjoy the seamless integration between my phone and tablet now. It makes editing much easier. You guys are doing a fantastic job!
1273,Stroodle,"June 25, 2016",5,"Treasure trove I feel like I found buried treasure when I discovered Medium.  The app itself is OK... frankly nothing to write home about, but in its simplicity, it does allow the user's focus to follow what's really important; the stories various Medium users post.  Medium and the app do a great job of making it to find different stories to read about and also makes it easy to write your own.  Kudos to the team!"
1274,KayBee330,"August 13, 2016",5,Great Content The writing on this app provides tons of conversation starters among me and my friends. Just reading the content has made me want to write again. 
1275,Wheatonbrando,"December 23, 2016",2,"Great site, terrible buggy app I've had it with this app. It inevitably crashes within <5 minutes of me using it pretty much every single time. Also you have to click 5 or 10 times to get it to load any article. The search function is poor, and it's been overloading my feed with sports ever since it launched The Ringer. We get it, they're paying you, yay. "
1276,Anchor98,"April 10, 2017",5,"Must review! I seldom review apps, but Medium demands recognition. I am in my self-defined 2nd life. In he first (until age 48) I was the picture of  health--a very fit military officer, participating in some demanding yet rewarding activities. At age 48, I rapidly slipped into a myriad of disabling medical conditions including constant pain. Medium has, in a short time, opened for me a tremendous breadth of information worthy of my attention. It's almost addictive! Thanks for a great app--well done!"
1277,Utahfreeskier,"April 23, 2017",5,"Thank goodness for Medium Medium is a breath of fresh air within the polluted web. I love how I only see content that is tailored to my interests (without spammy pop-ups, etc). It's also great to read on such a clean interface which lets me focus on my content."
1278,Mathew Heggem,"July 24, 2017",5,"Medium rocks for business! I use this tool to keep my brain engaged with great content. And, it's a great place to connect with people who can help you to see your business in new ways, especially useful for entrepreneurs and small biz CEOs. The ability to highlight and comment is useful when doing research too, especially if you're writing and presenting content as a speaker. Medium rocks!"
1279,Lmilligan08,"September 17, 2017",5,"Cannot locate authors I follow.. I love this app, but there are some obvious navigation issues (imo) that get in the way of my experience as a user. For example, I follow authors who consistently write great content, but locating their profile to see what they have published recently is not very user friendly. I would like to see less ""suggested content"" and more content that I've explicitly chosen to follow."
1280,Maugrim547,"May 21, 2014",3,"Obviously not it's final model As is, the app is sufficient. It's easy to read on the iPhone. It's used solely for reading, which doesn't bother me. I assume they might try and make the leap to writing at some point."
1281,Only review I'll ever write,"August 2, 2015",5,"Yes Everything about this app is great. The interface is beautifully and elegantly designed, and the content is no short of stellar. Medium is a platform to share personal stories, insights, learned values, and to instigate social awareness and change. It's a place to share ideas on gender equality, race issues, discriminations, poetry, humor, and life lessons that are just plain interesting to read. It reminds me of a scripted Ted talk. I love it. It's stunning."
1282,Colco8i,"November 29, 2015",5,"A change in Medium I remember when I was a young Artist, the word medium meant what art supply the piece was made of."
1283,runester,"January 21, 2016",4,"Excellent reading experience Reading in the app or the website is excellent. Being able to bookmark a story in the web and then read it in the app is an excellent solution for downtime. My only criticism is in article discovery,  especially with their idea of ""magazines"" hosted on Medium. In any case, this is a quality reading app. I haven't used it to write any Medium articles, yet, and the iPhone keyboard may make that annoying, but it's an option."
1284,Barney5474,"February 5, 2016",5,"Favorite New Years addition to my daily routine Medium dropped into my life at the perfect time. I'm a recent college grad that made ""reading more"" my New Years resolution for 2016 and then along came Medium that has filled my life with new material every day that I can usually read in a short amount of time for just the pick me up I need. Articles about my interests all gathered in one place. Genius."
1285,Ben Larzi,"March 17, 2016",5,"The Sanctuary of Words In a time when photos and videos seem to have replaced the written word (don't get me wrong, I'm a full time creative director, I love images and films), Medium has created a place for words to flourish. Are there issues? At times, and they can be frustrating. But all great things take time and effort, and what is being formed at Medium is - in my opinion - incredible."
1286,iSkiatDV,"April 2, 2016",4,"Solid app Clean interface, doesn't have the crash issues many other apps seem to have. "
1287,Dog.,"January 14, 2017",5,"Love this - highly recommended I signed up on The Writers Cooperative and they use Medium. You can read the tiny articles of others and also write your own, and have followers, favorites, recommend articles, etc. "
1288,SMTevis,"January 27, 2017",5,"Medium is Personal in a Way That Publications are Not The app is a delightful experience – allowing for discovery, encouraging you to go deep, and settle in for ""6 minutes"" or whatever length is of the current thing your brain chooses to splash around in for a bit. Facebook feels like work. Twitter makes me feel shallow. Medium makes me whole – often for at least 6 minutes. Thank you, Medium."
1289,ThatPersonOnAnIphone,"February 6, 2017",5,"Just a Reading Tool, Nope So Much More When I first downloaded the app, I thought this was just a tool to read articles. I quickly found out that this was a great way to reach people who wanted to write about all sorts of things. It is easy to use and definitely does well to suit your interests and what you want to read. I am the one who personalizes my Medium- not some bot- great app!"

If I were your boss, or worked anywhere in your company, I would make sure you were fired immediately!!!!   Why in the @&$!?$&@$ would anyone ever build in the ability to save a bookmark in an app without also allowing you to access your bookmarks???  Fire yourselves, you fools!!!  Cleaning up your ignorance in a future release is of no value...  You have proven yourselves unworthy of being software developers... even at the lowest levels.  Please just change careers and do something that requires no logical thought whatsoever.  You might be good at that."
1291,Young Author Dylan Alexander,"February 5, 2016",4,"""...virtually flawless..."" An amazing, inventive new ""journalism-by-the-people"" app that is virtually flawless in its execution, Medium only has one flaw, in my opinion: that it, to some extent, lacks a more conservative user base to counterbalance its mostly left-leaning populace and create more of a debate than the current one, which relies almost solely on minor nuances between different sorts of lefties."
1292,Birdnyc,"February 6, 2016",5,"articles curated for you Imagine for a moment that Goldilocks was not a consumer of porridge, but rather of relevant and interesting articles. Unlike some methods that are too much work, too scattered, too focused, or too inaccessible, Medium is the aggregator of content that is just right. And if the Bear family comes home, think of the great dialogue she could have with them about the Medium piece she just read!"
1293,Ange_South,"May 9, 2016",5,"How to tell if Medium is for You If you find yourself writing lengthy captions on Instagram/FB photos, wanting to share thoughts, ideas, and or stories, are a writer, or simply enjoy reading Medium is the app for you. I'm a writer and life-long journal keeper and I absolutely love medium!! It has helped me get back into my groove of writing, I love it! There's a plethora of reading material to choose from. It's a reader/writer's social network dream!"
1294,C. Nicks,"August 10, 2016",5,"Great for new users I started using Medium to find what I hope to be a long term relationship with reading. Being a new smartphone user and inexperienced reader, I didn't know where to begin. Medium's method of introducing content helped me figure out what I actually care about, and how I can look forward to waking up in the morning to look at that beautiful face- my phone screen."
1295,rsklarer,"September 24, 2016",5,"The stories we live by I was looking for something different other than playing a game or reading Facebook in my free moments during the day, and I came across Medium. I find myself amazed and honored to read the many of the shared shorts posted here. I recommend this app to everyone whose looking for connection with different views, opinions and heartfelt journeys of others on this planet."
1296,VladVuc,"September 29, 2016",5,"Inovative and stunning Amazingly done, visually appealing, easy to use. Easy to connect your own writings with apps. I love medium. I love to colours, how easy is to read on iPhone and continue same text on iPad... Also writing draft on computer, then finishing up in a taxi on your phone. Amazing very futuristic and promising platform. It made me close my Wordpress blog and switch to this one. Well done guys!"
1297,Data123654,"December 21, 2016",5,"Thoughtful New Sources and Interactions. I have found Medium a good source to find the pulse of today's news.

I appreciate being able to read articles without being subjected to the click-bait advertising of other social media sights."
1298,Gabe and Kate,"February 10, 2017",5,"The app works great, the content is better! Usually hate those boxes that ask you to rate apps! But since I've learned so much from medium )because of its content base) it deserved this rating. But seriously the app is seamless I can go from the desktop to my phone and still feel the same experience. Which allows you to really focus on the content."
1299,illegalprelude,"June 8, 2017",5,"Excellent for reading but so-so for writers I'll be brief and say that Medium is a fantastic place to discovering deeper writing. From sports, to tech, politics, poetry, economics, and yes, erotica, Medium has it all. "
1300,lkg20,"April 26, 2014",5,"Amazing I discovered Medium a couple weeks ago and I felt robbed because I hadn't discovered it sooner. How in the world had I managed to miss this gem in the App Store?! This is an app which has actually improved and enriched my life. Honestly, if someone told me I had to delete all the apps from my phone except for one, Medium would be the one standing alone on my home page."
1301,Hartgirl8,"January 4, 2016",4,Fix bugs & it's a solid 5 stars It's nice that there's still a place where one can both write freely and then also read good content.  I sure hope neither of these attributes change.  My four star rating reflects the technical side of the app. I can't seem to get through more than a couple of sentences before it crashes? I've done updates and it's really frustrating.  Please fix bugs!
1302,Talia Basma,"April 8, 2016",5,"Great app It's simple and straightforward. The website itself is easier just because the computer is easier in my opinion, the only noticeable difference is that sometimes you forget where you are (what you last clicked-aka it's more a me problem) and it's hard to navigate but with use it becomes easier."
1303,Sarah.A.J,"July 14, 2016",5,"Perfect way to start my day If it helps as a frame of reference, if Flipboard and Pinterest had a baby, it would be Medium."
1304,Scott Blackman,"July 30, 2016",3,notification reminder I really enjoy reading content on Medium. I've enjoyed the app but I've ultimately deleted the app. When I open the app it always asks me to turn on notifications. My only option is On or Later. Why can't I say No. I don't ever ever want notifications. I don't mind email notifications and there's plenty of control for that. But I don't ever want any iOS notifications and it's terribly frustrating that saying no to those isn't an option.
1305,Dean Davis,"September 9, 2016",5,"Love you too, Medium It's great. Medium is great. I can just read stuff. I don't have to treat it like social media and worry about whether I'm properly exhibiting interest in the people in my network. Also MEL Magazine is a superstar at posting short, pithy, and engaging stories about stuff I'm happy to read about. It's like a more empathetic Vice, and I'm glad they have a home as nice as Medium. Which is nice."
1306,Tinksgirl,"November 13, 2016",5,"Beautiful I love using the mobile app, especially when I need some inspiration. I can easily scroll through and read pieces by people I follow, or even find new people to follow. It's also great for writing a draft and publishing it when I'm ready. I highly recommend it for anyone who finds inspiration everywhere, and not just at their computer."

1308,Isolatō,"March 8, 2017",5,"Medium Review I don't know who named this platform, but they need to seek therapy as calling it ""Medium"" does it no justice.  Indeed it is so Rare it may not even be dead -- merely hibernating.  Of course ""Medium"" is Latin singular for ""Media"" and that it IS, however, just for anyone who might otherwise confuse it, Medium is anything but MEDIOCRE.  It's a platform that's summoned some amazing content writers and I've only begun browsing.  I recommend it unreservedly."

I really hate having to go back to the new home page scroll and then have to scroll all the way down to where I just read something to continue down to find my next read.  Plus every time I open it I have to basically do the same...scroll down to where I left off.  Maybe it was the ""same"" w cover scroll but it sure didn't feel like it."

1313,Rpee47,"April 27, 2016",5,"Great way to spend time I absolutely love this app, and the content it provides. It's structured to allow independent writers with a platform to share their thoughts and ideas, and everyone can be an ""independent writer."" The quality of the content is determined by other readers/writers.  You may not like everything you see, but Medium allows voices that aren't ordinarily heard to speak."
1314,Yung Lean 2001,"May 17, 2016",5,"App interface is usable and doesn't crash Giving Medium a 5 star rating for the app itself.

The app caches the first version loaded and never bothers to check for changes to the web version. You can't be sure that the app displays new changes or comments. They have to fix this or the web version still remains superior and more trustworthy.

1340,Yesimahuman,"March 23, 2015",3,"Great potential The app is beautiful and simple, but the writing experience leaves a lot to be desired. For one, the drafts need to sync with the main site.

1345,eric.cc.su,"July 17, 2016",5,"Great daily dose of reading and more This is my first review of any app simply because Medium is so useful to me. The app is smooth and intuitive and I don't even have to leave the ""For you"" recommendations to find enough reading to fill up my day. Medium is a needed change of pace from the daily news, or quick news sites."
1346,Jflorizel,"September 21, 2016",5,The best way to share stories and written content I was introduced to Medium just over a year ago. I have been apprehensively sharing my writing....(apprehensive from my own lack of confidence).
1347,SlowMotn,"November 3, 2016",5,Best blogging platform - highest quality writing I use this app every day and it allow me to learn from thought leaders from many fields. It's the TED talks of writing! I'm constantly surprised how much I enjoy the content that gets straight and to the point due to its medium length.
1348,sara1962,"May 14, 2017",5,Fantastic app that's still widely unknown I found Medium because my daughter is a writer and posts much of her work here. While checking it out I found there were lots of articles from other writers that spoke to many of my current issues. I check it more frequently than I ever thought I would.
1349,cooadams,"September 20, 2017",5,"Think a little, write, then think a little more. I write on Medium most days. A peak into what I am thinking and doing. I like catching others in the same process. Writing where I am reading helps me savor good poetry, good short stories, good descriptions. I also love the raw thrown down comments of some writers. A peaceful place on the web, for me at least."
1350,P. Jones Moody,"October 7, 2014",3,"Needs explanation I understand how this app works after their explanation with the release of the iPad app. The interface is based on the people you follow and recommendations that are similar to them. It's still lacks something that I can't quite place. Some sort of navigation scheme would add a sense of place within the app. It just feels like you don't have control, which takes some ""letting go"" to let the app do its thing."
1351,Jwaltonmedia,"August 2, 2015",5,"Enjoying this! For a while, I had been using the web interface, which I really enjoy, and only recently downloaded the native app. I'm pleasantly surprised and delighted by the quality put forth by the team at Medium. "
1352,Jason E,"October 5, 2015",5,Simple and enjoyable once you get into it It's taking time for me to get into medium. The launch of the iOS app helped a lot. The next thing that had to happen was finding writers who could actually write well and about topics for which I cared. Once that happened I found myself wanting to start my own medium blog
1353,Jeremy7,"October 10, 2015",5,"Internet how it was intended. I am new to Medium but just right off the bat, it was impressive. Amazing interface. Smooth and easy to use. This is how the Internet should be used. To share invaluable information to one another. This is a must have for those who want to read on anything current or for just humor."
1354,JumpNote,"July 3, 2016",5,"Must have. Because there is nothing like it. Direct, unedited access to someone's expression of the issues that matter to them so much that they cannot hold back. And they write about them. So you can read and feel something, and learn something. And connect. So get it and read. "
1355,GregMcHenry,"July 8, 2016",5,"Medium Is the medium for creative people of all endeavors! Medium is a wonderful app you can tailor to your interests, read and share your own thoughts about creativity, ideas, business entrepreneurial strategies, or virtually anything you want to discuss. There are many bright, creative people who contribute their narratives and share many valuable insights and encouragements."
1356,GioAy,"August 28, 2016",5,"My new favorite app If you love reading, you'll love this app. I always read random articles everyday and now I have a specific place where I can do this everyday and even share my own writings. I wish I would of discovered this sooner. The wide amount of options to read from, it's amazing. I'm inspired. In love with this app"
1357,Mister Bop,"November 10, 2016",5,Excellent access to many differing ideas and perspectives I believe the title of this review expresses my appreciation for the app.  It takes me easily to the info I am interested in and provides easy access the info.  The materials I read are often quite well done and have helped me enlarge my understanding.   5 stars for this.
1358,Quick guide,"April 23, 2017",5,Superb This app and the whole idea behind it is just mind blowing. Every article written is a work of art. 
1359,Jbeltran,"April 26, 2017",5,"Best release notes on the App Store To be honest is worth having this app on your device just so you can enjoy Medium's quirky, offbeat release notes with every update. Oh and Medium has a lot of high quality content and a very nicely designed app. But mostly the release notes. Get it for the release notes!"
1360,Drewd29,"April 25, 2014",4,"Great content, too simple I understand your intent for this app to focus on the content, which it does very well, but I think it is too simple. It needs a way to access bookmarks, send to pocket, an editors choice section, and maybe a way to see most recent posts. I can't access my bookmarked articles. Please bring the functionality of the website to the app. Thanks"
1361,itsHECTORNOW,"September 20, 2015",5,Great articles. Easy to use and share It is my go-to source when looking for a new perspective. Some of the most interesting articles I've read are published here. There's lots of great and useful content. You can easily share the content to social platforms and you'll get exposed to enlightening perspectives on important subjects.
1362,Sage Padawan,"November 26, 2015",4,Made for humans I love the app. I'm able
1363,Hunter Holder,"February 23, 2016",5,Elegant and minimal Medium is a wonderful way to publish your thoughts. It has a built-in WYSIWYG editor (though I use iA Writer) that gives just enough control without making writing an article a chore. 
1364,mprentice,"April 24, 2016",5,"I love reading now So I'm the first to admit...I've never enjoyed reading books. I have stuff to do, time is money and I never quite have the attention span to sit down for more than a few minutes to read something. This gives me one spot to go to and interact with others on substantive material. I now enjoy reading!"
1365,The thing is awesome,"August 30, 2016",5,The future of media Medium has created a home for everyone looking for ways to improve. There are articles on just about every hobby that someone would want to get better at. The app is user friendly making it easy to find what you're looking for.
1366,Calfan92,"September 17, 2016",3,"Great stories and awesome writing! However, that doesn't mean that most of the site appears to be promoting other tech sites or the X number of things you could be doing or aren't doing enough of and you're a failure/worthless if you aren't.  Maybe I haven't found a way to mute those articles yet 😜. Give it a thumbs up for ease of use and the ability to respond, post and enjoy reading what other people are musing.  👍🏻"
1367,doug_and_deborah_foster,"December 12, 2016",5,"I like Medium on mobile I am a Medium junkie, mostly reader, often writer. I find the mobile app works best for responses and for reading but I have drafted a couple things on it. I like the notifications on here, too. Better than on the laptop. I wish you could send/receive private messages though."
1368,tdrewk,"August 22, 2017",5,"New icon is splendid As an avid reader and advocate of Medium, I was confused on the direction they've been headed in for some time. Starting with the previous app icon change, Medium seemed to be headed in the wrong path on many levels. The new icon is refreshing and an excellent representation of what Medium is about. The new direction seems to be a welcome course correction"
1369,earthboundmisfit75,"October 1, 2017",5,"Genuine articles I read about many different topics ranging from the physics of black holes to addiction recovery resources. Medium has articles from genuine, real people like me about anything and everything. Most importantly, these article are usually written in the first person, a personal narrative to accompany a journalistic piece. It is very refreshingly human."
1370,Bleumana15,"March 26, 2014",2,There's a glaring flaw here. The reading layout is good. However I've read one article from start to finish and swiped through about twenty more looking for something else to read. Without categories or any way to filter articles there doesn't seem to be a way to find stuff on topics of interest. Stop giving us writing about writing. Those articles are for amateurs. Give us some control over what we can read on here. Otherwise what's the point?
1371,Lord of iCloud,"May 22, 2014",3,"I get it, but I don't I love Medium as a blogging platform. It's beautiful and simple. And people write great things on the platform. "
1372,niketdesai,"August 6, 2015",5,"Basically, get this app. Use medium. It's amazing to me how quickly something seems obvious, but actually was a methodical and enduring experience to get right. Reading, writing, replying and learning on Medium has now surpassed any other platform for me (in quality not quantity). Funny, how Ev and team keeps finding ways to accomplish such things."
1373,StevenJemm,"February 22, 2016",5,"Interesting articles Ever since learning about Medium, I've been very conscious of small intricate things that are blogged and discussed, from Software & Productivity tools to Life tips and Inspirational posts. "
1374,Incitive,"March 16, 2016",5,"Needs more attention! It's been one of my favorite apps and services for about a year and I absolutely suggest everyone to check medium out. It's stories written by real people about insanely interesting and life changing ideas. No media bias of course,  just insanely great ideas and stories, written by people like myself."
1375,Ivandogman,"August 27, 2016",5,"Always challenging Love this reading experience. War is Boring has especially helped me deal with my year in Vietnam as a 19 year old Marine. War is seductive. Never have fully understood why. If you've been at war, or wondered about it, you get sucked in quick. Okay, you missed serving in a war. I served in a war and miss it. Find out why."
1376,ElyceSF,"December 11, 2016",5,"Provocative, interesting reads I look forward to spending a few minutes each with the wide variety of thoughts and reflections not available to me through the news apps I usually follow.  I might/not agree with the premise of the article/blog, but find them thought provoking and interesting.  A nice respite."
1377,HansSchiefelbein,"December 17, 2016",5,"Great writing experience and the community is building I am really enjoying Medium as a writing app and community. To be clear I am still new, but it feels like what I've always been hoping for with the WordPress community - a common place to share ideas and help each writer grow their skills and expand their reach and influence."
1378,independentthinker4u,"April 2, 2017",1,"15 minute time limit on enrollment email, takes 28 minutes to receive. Been trying to read an article all day. Published only on Medium. Have create an account. I'm not giving an unknown app my Facebook or twitter account so I'm doing it with email. Can't read the article until my account is verified. Can't verify account until the email comes in. Email takes 28 minutes to show up and has a 15 minute time limit. THREE attempts to read this article and failed. "
1379,stickboy18,"June 17, 2017",5,"Brilliantly useful I downloaded this app with skepticism, thinking there was no advantage over my browser for Medium. I was unjustified in my skepticism! What a great app experience (for a change). One of a kind interface. Features all woven in, not distractingly out front & distracting. Even if you don't use Medium, you likely will start."
1380,vpribish,"November 25, 2014",2,"Gave up you signature navigation? Wow.   That's some funny product management you've got going on there. The swipe-to-change-articles feature was sort of the only thing medium had to differentiate it from any other reader-like apps.   It was brilliant, intuitive, and efficient.   It was what I told people about when recommending Medium.  Now you have to make 4 taps to get to the next article, and you've lost your place should you go back.  What were you thinking Medium?"
1381,GolfSquared,"February 14, 2016",5,Great way to consume interesting content This app gives you content written by real people and not just what the media outlets would want to feed you.
1382,Sueplustwo,"March 13, 2016",5,Medium is fabulous for everyone What I live about Medium is that people write their opinions about all types of subjects and you don't have to agree with them but you can definitely comment on it. It's a wonderful media page for people to voice opinions and have discussions. I highly recommend  it!!
1383,Chas_rick,"March 19, 2016",5,Every day Every day I start off with a cup of coffee and a few of the latest medium articles that have been recommended for me. Each article is better than the last and all catered towards what I want to read about/who's writing I want to read. Could not recommend enough.
1384,Italianradio,"May 19, 2016",5,"For when you want the world to say how you feel If you can't put your thoughts and feelings into words, Medium helps make it possible--the the experiences of another. If you like to relate with others on a human level, and detach from the business world a bit, Medium makes it possible."
1385,christinedlg,"May 21, 2016",5,"Read and Soar I don't think Medium actually needs another amazing review. But I'll do this anyway to help sustain/increase the app ranking. And because it's deserved. I adore Medium. I follow folks who inspire me and discover folks who inspire them and so on. It's an organism of inspiration and insights. When I go to Medium, I always find something that makes my mind and/or spirit soar."
1386,BlueSkies2013,"June 6, 2016",5,"Better Late Than Never I'm late to Medium, but I'm so glad it stumbled into my inbox. I love reading everyday but sometimes find it difficult to sift through so many blogs trying to sell something.  Medium allows me to get lost in someone's thoughts and musings without feeling like I'm being ""sold."" Great company of writers and readers here."
1387,Maggie2012a,"August 27, 2016",4,"Medium is a great conversation I like Medium because I know I can find something there I'm not seeing in other media.  Today, I ran into some incredibly relevant articles for my current work that really got my creative thoughts moving along.  I like that I don't know what generation a writer is from.  I like the openness I see here.  It's a place I might put my book in 4 min reads.  :)"
1388,YouIUplol,"January 27, 2017",5,"Medium is a great atmosphere for all aspiring journalists and fun-writers. Medium has very easy to use interface and allows for anyone to create an account and write on many topics. I love how we are able to see articles posted by not only notable people, but up and coming journalists as well. The tag system works great too!"
1389,PJ ONeal,"March 19, 2017",5,Amazing I've been writing on Medium for quite some time now. Medium has helped me expand my audience and polish my style. It's also introduced me to writers and publications I might now have found otherwise.
1390,Roboy1423,"March 30, 2014",3,"Would've been 5 but needs work I love medium. I like to read the articles when I need to pass some time. The only problem is with the navigation. You can't check any of the stories you bookmarked, you can't work on any articles, and you can't even view your user profile. I'm sure they'll work these things out In the next update, but for now I give this app 3 stars"
1391,SkCambo,"March 5, 2015",5,"We have a search button Finally, the main issue that avoiding me from using medium iOS app is fixed. Thanks for making such a amazing app that consist of beautiful stories. It would be great if you allow reader to design their own playlists. Aside from that, it is nice right now."
1392,Great tutorial on Wordpress,"February 18, 2016",5,"Better than the formal publications, it's the voice of the people I devour articles and am always scouting out different sources to follow. So far I've thoroughly enjoyed using Medium. The articles are so much more real and unfiltered, something I think the world needs. The app has a great interface and easy to use!"
1393,Tutorial 1,"November 10, 2016",4,"Offline read please All articles are cache not having a download option makes the app actually worse than safari experience which has reading list could download the page. Please allow downloading articles in the app please, just the text is enough, won't be hard."
1394,Nicholas Richardson,"November 28, 2016",4,"Great design and platform, could use some performance enhancements. The app design is very clean and the platform is brilliant. I can't help but get a bit frustrated when scrolling through my feed or an article the text and images scroll in a jumpy, way. You can defiantly tell that there is stuttering and the app would be perfect if this is addressed."
1395,KirayFer,"December 17, 2016",5,"Amazing As a reader and writer wannabe I have used in the past many many apps to get me interested in reading more often, Medium gives me the opportunity to do that and even better, write my own thoughts... that said it deserves the 5 stars because of the poem in this version... it was a blast... congrats to the poet... 😂😂😂"
1396,Nomoreuberforme,"December 24, 2016",5,"One of my favorite places for reading Trying to quantify this app is really difficult.  It's a community forum for every day people to either share their creativity, articulate things I've never thought about but find myself saying ""ah-hah"", or express their opinions.  It's been a really wonderful ride so far....."
1397,hopeless143,"January 19, 2017",5,"I've never rated an app, until now. As long as I have had Apple, I don't think I've ever rated an app. Much less an app I hated. I figured they'd know I didn't like it 2 minutes into using one, and then deleting the application. However, ""Medium"" is by far my most used app and best discovery in the Apple Store. Bravo!"
1398,Carrieshy,"June 5, 2017",5,So many good stories I love to waste hours upon hours browsing this app. There is so many different categories to chose from that I never get bored. It is also a great way to connect with people who genuinely want to help others. This app is where good people and good writing make a perfect connection.
1399,MRTerbrueggen,"July 21, 2017",5,Beautiful This is my favorite app. I love to read and write. The interface is beautiful and easy to use. I LOVE the audio portion and became a member as soon as I say this! I travel a lot and can't always read when doing things like driving or navigating because I've been told this is dangerous and neglectful.
1400,brandonstarnes007,"October 2, 2015",4,Love it but missing one thing I really like this app and product. It is a great way to digest content. It's missing I think on the highlight feature. It needs a highlight feature like on kindle you drag your finger over the content rather than the cursor way. It also needs to allow you to interact and see your followers.
1401,Ray Zorback,"December 9, 2015",3,"It's good, needs work on the Pro I've been switching to the pro for all my computing. This app is ""OK"" for that. I wish it fit better on the screen and was a little easier to use and add photos to post. It's better than average, but needs some polishing."
1402,TomDyer,"December 16, 2015",5,"Good app and platform. Imagine a giant, fairly well written magazine on your phone and you have Medium. After you figure out what the minimalist navigation represents, you can pretty much zip through hundreds of fiction, nonfiction, commentary and epistolary communications easily and efficiently. The app is as easy and intuitive as the website."
1403,hiata,"February 26, 2016",4,Ripping reads This is a wonderful platform for writers. I was suckered into being a fan before I realized it's a blogging platform that most people aren't even being paid to produce. Wonderful writers and sad writers alike. It's like the best magazine ever because it's open mic. I only give it 4 stars because you can get a little lost in the interface (but that may be some evil genius' design).
1404,Marco H-Dub,"April 11, 2016",3,"4/8/16 Update Crashing I'd love to give the app more stars, but they seem to update with bug fixes more frequently than any other app I have. "
1405,MsPhyitness,"April 18, 2016",5,"""Apptly"" named...5⭐️ content! One of my favorite things about the app is that I can bookmark reads that I want to save to read later. Also, the ability to easily write and/or quickly comment on the articles is well integrated. Straightforward UI/UX and clean design makes this app one I open daily!"
1406,Mike Marcacci,"May 9, 2017",5,"Beautiful app, thoughtful community I do love this platform, and right now the tone of discourse on it is a thoughtful reprieve from most of the rest of the internet. Sadly, I don't see anything intrinsic to the Medium platform that will prevent this from changing as it continues to grow in popularity... but at least for now, it's just wonderful."
1407,user_ali,"May 14, 2017",5,"Thoughtful and complete articles I am so suprised at the quality of the articles on this platform. Well written, actionable and very informative. Not sales oriented. Some of the articles I read should be academic papers in their own right (and may be they will be). I hope the quality does not erode w time."
1408,Hamzah C,"September 16, 2017",4,Excellent medium for reading! I have come to enjoy reading from this app because of its community and style as well as every article having its own message with writers essentially from the public. One thing I really wish the developers included is the ability to turn on a dark mode for reading in the night.
1409,hillaryrobyn,"September 19, 2017",5,"Great app I've been using this app for a while now and so far everything has been great. The only thing I've noticed (and this could be user error) is that you can't see referrers like you can on the website. It would be cool to have that, but otherwise it's good."
1410,mtorourk,"July 13, 2014",4,"Great start I think this is a great version 1.0 app, despite the extremely simple functionality. Sure there's a lot you can't do, but you can read and browse posts with a really smooth and beautiful interface without a lot of clutter. I'm sure they will add more functionality in future updates, but for now I'm enjoying the app."
1411,Gunnernr,"November 27, 2014",5,Latest update The latest update has made all the difference. I love reading medium content but couldn't take the last native app concept. I have been just using the mobile web version. Thought I'd give the app a try again... Good work with the updates! Much better UI/UX.
1412,film0918,"October 16, 2015",5,"My new favorite reading/consumption platform! I discovered Medium about a month ago, and it's now my favorite place to read and consume great thinking / stories.

1413,kelin522,"February 11, 2016",5,"Good articles, simple app Medium is a great blogging app for the recent entrant into blogging, because it makes writing online easy and simple. It's also a great medium (ha) for supporting the stories and opinions that you don't see in mainstream news outlets. "
1414,Aneebaba,"February 26, 2016",5,"Late to join the crowd but loving it! I am a late arrival to Medium, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the authors and articles I've come across. I've seen some concerns about changes to the content versus the original intended purpose, which I can understand, but I think it's still a great place for enlightened topics, discourse and ideas."
1415,Thsista,"May 14, 2016",5,"I am so addicted to this app I am pretty much on this app all the time now and I am on it more than facebook. I love how there is so much content on so many different topics on current events. On fb you can get lost in very superficial articles and quizzes, but on medium everything is very intellectual content."

1417,Itskgd,"January 10, 2017",5,"Freshest Content on the Web Medium is a home for essayists, writers and learners. It's a journalistic forum, of course, but it's very different than an editorialized publisher, which would have an agenda, guardrails and a POV. Medium is a place where an idea can be seen. Any environment this open can be difficult to navigate, but discovery and inspiration are what Medium does best."
1418,jonnilundy,"March 9, 2017",5,"There is nothing medium about Medium Medium understands what it takes to create a wonderful writing and reading experience. Although I do prefer the desktop version because the extra screen realestate brings out their masterful usage of white space, the app is a great on-the-go version."
1419,Jefe001,"April 9, 2017",5,"Slick, focused, fast app for great material Very clean design and sharp focus allows me to enjoy Medium authors much more easily.

I've discovered so many writers on this app I might not have otherwise."
1422,GigiBonjour,"February 21, 2016",5,"Excellent! I love Medium!  I downloaded it because I'm hankering to start a bit of writing myself and in the meanwhile have been thoroughly inspired by pieces written about all subject manner.  I read on Medium daily and always take away something interesting from a new perspective, learn something new or get a good laugh.  Very enriching!"
1423,Pumpkin509786,"June 5, 2016",5,"Cornucopia of resource I literally have to limit myself from reading. There is always another article. If you have a question from something you just read, they have the answer for you in the next article in your feed. Kinda scary."
1424,trenks,"June 29, 2016",5,Great app to read a quick few articles when you have a few minutes I like to use medium in my downtime or over coffee. Just a chance to see what thought leaders are saying all in one place and win some customization available. Great app.

Sure, you may not care for one kind of ways dozens more that you would find delightful.  Thank you for reliably making my day!"
1426,2biff2,"January 5, 2017",3,"Ghosted Penetrating insight shared on every level by a broad spectrum of talent. The human condition is covered with experience, flare, conviction, and articulation better than any website I've seen. Any noble interest exists in this marketplace, and I suspect that any degree of engagement one is comfortable with as well. The site puts one in touch with feelings and beliefs he is unable to articulate, and curiosity teaches practical lessons he would not have otherwise known. Developmental. Nice."
1427,trevor_d,"March 5, 2017",5,New design I have been reading Medium for approximately one year and really enjoy the new format with discoverable tiles in the upper third. The layout is ideal for an iPad mini or larger. I spend more time in the app highlighting specific sections and giving my own take on the articles that make me think.
1428,stej,"June 2, 2017",5,"Every day read Medium is a one stop shop for diverse, relevant thought provoking writing about current world, national and business as well as many social topics.  I tried Medium as a part of my daily intake of new and stimulating thought provoking writing and it has become a go to daily source."
1429,Nattice,"June 13, 2017",2,"Updated home screen is a step backwards I miss the ability to be able to see what blogs/publications have been updated since I last read them. Why completely remove a useful feature like that? I'm all for robust recommendation systems to help me in deciding what to read, but those should exist alongside options to let me find that layout if I so choose (see the ability to still sort FB feed by reverse cron if desired)."
1430,Happy Medium user!,"September 1, 2015",5,"Fantastic app tailored for reading experience I use this app more than I use the actual Medium site on my desktop. It's a great reading experience and I can easily pull up stories while on my commute, waiting in line, or otherwise during down time. Love Medium and love the app experience!"
1431,Deborah Hymes,"March 8, 2016",5,"It just gets better & better I've liked Medium from Day One, but over time I've come to really love it for its smart, well-written long-form & short-form thinking. I'm now enjoying the app's features that make it even easier to access the content I want to read!"
1432,TheFilmMusicGuy,"March 11, 2016",5,"Reddit Who?! This is truly one of the best article, blog, creative writing locations out there. The app works well enough and allows me to find the stories and information I'm interested in. Love that it gives me an average time of how long the article will be to read. Highly recommend."
1433,Sfnysf,"March 23, 2016",5,"Like the website. But in our iDevice If only there was an easy way to get to bookmarked articles? Maybe the Medium team thinks I really enjoy digging, like an archeologist or excited Labrador. If so, thanks for the intent, but I'd prefer a clear way to access the articles I've bookmarked to read later."
1434,Onesandzeros,"May 27, 2016",4,"Writings UI great, comments not so much 4 stars because eventhough i really love medium and how it has brought a new clean way of consuming essays, the comment section is not that great. It could be worse though(see disqus) but i hope they change so that you dont have to navigate from page to page just to read a comment"
1435,VicTheSlick,"November 12, 2016",5,The Apple of Online Publishing Medium's simplicity is both intuitively and elegantly designed. With each update they bring more and more usability improvements that their people can actually find helpful and useful. If only other social and community apps could take note! :)
1436,FWG001,"November 18, 2016",5,"Designed for reading Like the website, this app does a great job at letting me read the great content on Medium. "
1437,Pieter B,"November 22, 2016",3,"Lots of excellent content, user-hostile interface. Some of the best content on the web is found on Medium, but Navigating through articles and comments takes at least one extra click for each step of the way. E.g., if I see a comment has responses, and I click on the ""_x_ responses"" link, why do I have to click a link called ""Show out-of-network responses"" to read them?"
1438,hetzelfde,"September 10, 2017",5,"Daily read App design is well considered making it easy to navigate and respond to content. It removes some of the barriers I have with other media apps; the ability to highlight, save, respond and participate with the content makes it a joy to use."

1440,ricky_denver,"March 22, 2014",5,"Less useful than mobile web app. I was excited to see this released, but disappointed by the lack of functionality - I can't even access my bookmarked stories. I'm better off reading from mobile web site. I LOVE Medium but not this app."

1442,dbintune,"July 27, 2016",5,"Most(ly) Enjoyable I love reading the unabashed, unadulterated opinions that come shining through as these writers hone their craft. I wish that all had a sense of the importance of basic editing. I have to be careful not to take too literally, or ""post-fact-checked"" the tone and content of these wonderfully expressive minds. Great site."
1443,CCheyne,"October 18, 2016",5,"When I need me time and want to think I love reading articles on Medium.

1444,Fubarahh,"November 25, 2016",5,"It's called Medium but it's actually highly intelligent articles. I'm not sure how I discovered Medium, but I'm glad I did. There are articles on here that are intelligent, well written & thought provoking. So far, I think the Trolls haven't discovered it.  What a relief from FB.  It's nice to be able to vent in a relatively safe environment."
1445,Jimseb,"February 21, 2017",5,"Outstanding experiment in longer form writing I am an avid reader of the Browser as well as 3 Quarks Daily.

I look forward to more of them."

1447,cmillet64,"July 7, 2017",5,Best Writing Platform This app is simple and user friendly. It has allowed me to practice my writing skills and get feedback from those that are on the app. I would highly recommend starting on Medium before you begin your own website or blogging site.
1448,mnkyntigr,"September 4, 2017",5,"Going places where most are not After a couple of months of reading, I am beginning to sense that Medium will take me places where I did not expect web surfing to go. Most pieces reflect the passion, effort and intensity of their authors / creators. Very creative and worth your while."

1454,Thesilverbeard,"November 6, 2016",5,"The quality of articles is just incredible! Be prepared to have some free time taken if you get this app!  The topics range widely, and the writing is great.  You can also give comments and ask questions.  I can't recommend it highly enough."
1455,Frugal college student,"January 24, 2017",5,"Problematically perfect I enjoy reading Medium so much that it has because the most dangerous procrastination method in my arsenal. Luckily, it's also the most reliable source of inspiration I've ever come across. Most important is the way it empowers individuals to convey their thoughts and feelings and be heard. Keep it up."
1456,HRK55132,"January 28, 2017",5,"Perfect Tech The content on Medium is interesting because as a publishing and reading platform, tech and user design is perfect. For that reason, both professional writers and new ones find it an inviting showcase for their work and the general content level is fairly high. Medium's engineers/creators deserve applause!"
1457,Shifu Dr. Tim,"February 14, 2017",5,"Medium gives me hope that collective intelligence can survive Easy to navigate and interact. High standards of thinking and writing appear to be maintained.

I started to replace my time spent on social media with reading interesting articles and blogs from this app instead. It is time much better spent.
1460,MauiAli,"August 1, 2015",5,I am writing my first app review ever - medium is that good. I love being connected to quality content that I find relevant. I love being able to fluidly move between and share articles. I give this app more of my time than any other app - I recommend that you do as well.
1461,Jerichoman,"October 16, 2015",5,How refreshing This app allows me to hear thru reading other people's ideas thru reading. It's almost like mini mentoring sessions. I take what I want and need and leave. It's like going to church and deciding if you want to get up and leave or stay and be encouraged. That's what it is... Encouragement
1462,MakeDesign,"November 12, 2015",5,"Smart, intuitive, independent information. There are a ton of great news feed style apps out there, but Medium is the only app that I actually find myself revisiting on a continual basis.

1463,Tinobal,"November 17, 2015",4,Love Medium - just need night reading mode I usually check in with Medium at least twice a day and have read some really good content. I've sent emails to the developers about supporting night reading mode (a la Kindle) but still not a feature. Would love to read in bed but too bright with the white background.

1466,Jlynnmurph,"August 24, 2016",5,"Love this app It's great. There's truly some amazing writers on Medium. If you are an aspiring writer you should definitely check it out. While you can just lurk like me & read the writing of others, you can also establish your own collection of writings about pretty much anything."
1467,AbsolutelyNickB,"November 1, 2016",5,"A must have. The perfect app/site for anyone who loves to read, has an opinion & loves to write as well. The interface is clean, simple and can't be topped.

1468,T-Rizzi,"February 5, 2017",5,"Medium I have totally stopped reading and viewing fake news and I feel better already.

1470,Al Sargent,"May 14, 2014",1,Can't sign in I'm an author in Medium and like their web app a lot and am using it as my primary blogging platform. So it pains me to give their iOS app a poor review. 
1471,Dflslen,"November 26, 2014",3,Endless scrolling < Swiping What made this app great for me was having to swipe through from article to article. It forced me to look at each one and it sometimes got me reading one I normally wouldn't have read had I just seen the title. This new update ruins the app experience for me. I have enough apps where I scroll endlessly and lose interest. Medium was supposed to be different.
1472,Somboune,"February 20, 2016",5,"Easy to read, enjoy and publish Medium makes it easy to not only read an article (they even tell you how long it will take so you know if you have the time), but they also make it easy to publish from your phone."
1473,G-patt,"February 27, 2016",5,"Great platform I'm a bit ADD. When I pick up my phone or open a web browser, I'm likely to find myself an hour later saying, ""wait, what was I originally here for?""  Medium is the only app/destination where I feel like I'm better off for the time spent! Well done."
1474,KGxoxo12,"June 7, 2016",5,Great reads that keep your mind moving! Medium combines everything you could possibly want with reading. Don't have a book on hand? Forgot your kindle? Medium gives you the perfect platform to get that dose of reading and learning from a wide variety of authors.
1475,Llllllllalalala,"June 9, 2016",5,Great app Works well and the content is always interesting. The comments interface is a little annoying because you leave the original page when reading a conversation thread.

1478,zoster100,"June 23, 2017",5,"A step forward in storytelling For those individuals trying to share their ideas and stories without becoming a vlogger, blogger or the like. This app allows the sharing of thought-provoking articles as well as goofy rants to an audience that might actually care."
1479,Susan from San Fran,"August 15, 2017",5,"Medium At first, I was skeptical, as I am of any app. But I kept receiving notifications that caught my interest. I had lost my passion for writing and I find it slowly coming back through the terrific articles and info on Medium. It's something I look forward to every day."
1480,Ebediel,"October 15, 2015",4,Great App Except I really love this app which allows me to be able to input into articles I've read. Currently the only problem I have is with it crashing. Nothing more frustrating than writing a post only to have it crash before I can post it. Fix the crashes and I'll gladly give it five stars.
1481,K. Sager,"January 10, 2016",4,"Thoughtful Writing and POVs I enjoy longer, more developed posts and Medium is fast becoming my favorite place to go for this kind of reading. It features well-argued, interesting pieces that make me think. I expect it will continue to increase in breadth as the sites subscribers and contributors expand beyond its tech audience roots. The New Galley section is really promising. Thumbs up."

1484,ellietunes,"November 13, 2016",5,"Intelligent, rational reading Reading the comment section on Medium compared to any other outlet on the internet is reason enough to download.

1485,Justileonne,"December 18, 2016",5,"Finally the right Voyeur Instead of feeling like each time you are at the medium , being red by a woman with a raised eyebrow and slightly snarled opinion, I have found this crystal ball to be entertaining and happily finally finding outlooks I can enjoy.  This medium seems to be as legit as you make it.."
1486,MomzMusic,"March 7, 2017",5,"Medium is for long and detailed writing Medium is the place to read more of the story.

1488,Sir_gi0,"June 6, 2017",5,"all the good feelings If you enjoy the website, you'll enjoy the app. I prefer to do my writing on the site but I think that says more about me than the app itself. I just don't like working off of my phone in that way."

1490,ironman159,"May 31, 2014",3,"Beautiful for what it is. For what they advertise in the description, it's a wonderful app. But for what Medium really is all about, this app is fundamentally flawed. I can't read my own posts (or it's incredible well hidden and I don't know why) and most of all: I can't write a post. I love reading through the app but reading is Medium's half of the story. Writing is an essential component of this social network."
1491,jonathankoren,"March 25, 2015",2,"Reading Okay. Writing Broken The new composer is seriously broken. Every letter you type causes the entire screen to scroll down, then bounce back, resulting in pages and pages of whitespace above where you're typing. The formatting options compared to the web composer are different and lacking. Finally, you can't have more than one draft composition. For writers this app is really bad."
1492,TREB321,"August 9, 2015",5,"Great content and writing People do not read email attachments in general. We need to consider  fewer better words in everything we write. Medium is trying to do that and has accomplished great success. Much more needs to be done to make writing captivating, intriguing, and real. Content is king."
1493,Dr. K. L. Rohm,"January 6, 2016",5,"Medium is great.

1495,Nanna to 2,"February 19, 2017",5,Stay informed with diverse opinions I greatly appreciate the many varied views and opinions to be found on Medium.

Medium is where I go for help to keep and open mind.
1496,crawlrawl,"April 4, 2017",5,"Love It. It keeps getting better.

1497,Renegade Poet,"June 21, 2017",5,Easy to use The Medium app is an easy platform to read and write articles. I love the ability to write on my iPad from anywhere. I also love the suggestion heart and that I don't get a bunch of fake comments that are just really advertisements.
1498,VideoMogul,"July 4, 2017",5,Great app. For learning. People tell the truth on this app. They write about reality. While there is some spin in order to get read. The ideas are not driven by spin. They are driven about honest observation. It's not a news site It's like a guide to being a better human by those who ponder how to do so . Love it.
1499,TCBS,"July 22, 2017",5,Get Lost I enjoy reading on Medium so much so that I get lost in its pages. I can find just about anything that I want to read here and most of what I consume is really good.

So far I'm impressed not only with the writing but also with the genuine concern and caring I feel from the authors. No shouting, no name calling, no profanity - just intelligent discourse."
1504,Eleaaz,"April 6, 2016",5,Stories from real people Anyone can write and contribute their ideas in a short essay format.

1530,Fgvxxsr,"June 27, 2014",3,"Beautiful display, could function better. I love the layout and how it flows, but when I click the ""M"" at the top, there should be an option to post a new story to my medium, and an option to read my stories and see how they look on mobile. "
1531,engineersmusic,"March 17, 2016",5,"Great app! I really love Medium as a platform. It's helped me discover a lot of writers and interesting perspectives. It's a great way to consume and produce good medium form content that's insightful and fresh that other platforms militate against because they encourage brevity. Medium and long form are really necessary to tell stories, and I love it for that."
1532,Goatzz,"April 20, 2016",5,"Proper release notes Thank you for finally actually putting out proper release notes , letting your users know what has changed. As a fellow mobile dev myself , the previous format was neither funny nor informative."
1533,JandJ's Mom,"June 5, 2016",5,"More than I expected I was looking for a networking opportunity and got so much more. Not only am I able to network about this particular subject, I can also read and share about other interests as well"
1534,WebAtXcent,"June 19, 2016",5,My source of information. I have been reading Medium via browser since they launched. Didn't know it was going to become the next big thing. The app is beautifully executed bringing the best of Medium to the mobile platform.
1535,Jake72845041,"August 15, 2016",5,"Go-to App for Great Articles I love medium! Whenever I have an extra few minutes, I just open the app and am immediately presented with countless interesting articles written by people just like me. And you can write whatever you want too!"
1536,DCCStudent,"September 30, 2016",1,"Biased? The medium app works great, however I've noticed a huge amount of liberal stories on my ""For You"" section, even though I'm not actually following any of those tags. The most recent version update log also shows clear bias towards one horrible candidate over another horrible candidate. As much as I enjoyed the software development articles I read on medium, I'll be uninstalling the app and going back to the internet for my programming/development needs."
1537,Travels with dog,"October 19, 2016",5,My new most favorite source for news I travel a lot outside of the US and like to keep connected to what's happening. I've used other news feeds before this but Medium delivers interesting topics written by talented writers. Highly recommend it!
1538,KLUPO,"July 27, 2017",5,One of the smartest and best apps I've ever downloaded I love reading articles tailor made for me every day. It's inspiring! I also love how you can highlight inspiring phrases! These articles often seem more interesting and truthful than other more well established publications!!
1539,DJMihalis,"September 16, 2017",5,"Awesome app. Opening this app feels like opening a gift,  you know you're going to be surprised.  Love the writing and how you can follow a particular writer, who may specialize in a particular area of interest.  The app set up is easy and flows making enjoyable and stress free.  Fantastic Job!!👍👍👍"
1540,sm4llfill,"August 3, 2015",4,Awesome with one bad bug Lots of great content. The interface is also very nice looking. Took off one star because lots of times the app fails to load the articles and only give an endless spinner. I usually have to go out of the app or turn off app so it can load properly. Bad bad bug.
1541,Bitter Monk,"August 4, 2015",5,Refreshing Quite the take on the current mode of journalism and sharing. I hope many of you never find this and ruin it like all the other cool apps that got bought up by venture capitalists and lost their way.
1542,Faantaasteek,"August 15, 2015",5,Great reads with ability to participate Medium is becoming a great place for unique perspectives including from well known and established names. I really like the ability to participate in the article by annotating within the story. It beats adding to a long list of comments appended to the end.
1543,nyctoc,"March 28, 2016",5,fascinating content There's so much here if you know how to look. I'll start reading one post and end up reading 20.  Love this format.  So easy to use.  I haven't written anything (just read posts) but I plan to start posting soon. Medium is very inspiring.
1544,Caroline SB,"August 31, 2016",5,"A Great Place to Read! I thoroughly enjoy Medium. In fact, I spend hours each day reading articles and finding new writers to follow. I've posted my own articles and received great feedback from other writers. Love this app & the whole concept."

1546,Tgriff,"April 4, 2017",5,Essential for Writers and Readers Medium is a terrific platform for writers and a great source of smart content for readers.  Medium has recently launched a premium service that allows it to pay writers as well. It's like Twitter for people who like their information longer than 140 characters.
1547,swamidigital,"June 26, 2017",5,Best platform for Writing and Reading Medium is the best platform/community for sharing fully formed thoughts out there.  Discovery could be a bit better but there are a lot of new features being rolled out and I am excited to see what is to come.
1548,Renee096,"August 5, 2017",5,Quick Easy Reads I'm enjoying the articles and the chats they inspire. It great to fine a place you can read and share thoughts on just about anything. Also a place where all comments have welcomed.
1549,jmaryn,"August 9, 2017",5,Lots to Like Here I've been reading Medium articles ever since a friend recommended it. I enjoy that the screen printing sizes and photos are of a larger size and easy to read. Photos are generally beautiful.
1550,cara lynne,"March 22, 2014",2,"no nav! With no navigation I feel like I'm lost at sea here - it's hard to tell where I am, there's no category filtering or way to look at entire channels, and yes there's a way to bookmark, but no dedicated place to find them as a list. Right now this app is bare bones, exclusively for just random reading, not finding content that I'll really enjoy. I love Medium on the web and was excited for an app, but they're just not the same yet."
1551,ioni@niela,"March 27, 2014",5,Beautiful The app is great and works great. The only 2 things that bother me is that the texts seems to be a bit fuzzy and I don't get where to start reading. When the app relaunches I get to the same story I left it in but to both sides I get new articles.

1553,Ceeru,"August 2, 2015",5,"Good, keep it that way I really like the interface as well as the content. Not sure what algorithm is used to show stuff on the home page, but it's good. Do not make the same mistake as quora where the good content got harder to discover/find"
1554,Amatdre,"February 27, 2016",5,Keeps getting better! Medium has become one of my daily used apps for finding and consuming community curated content. Absolutely crucial to setup a careful list of who to follow or use you Twitter account to import who you follow to get the best experience.
1555,photoalex,"June 11, 2016",2,"Unintentional content lock in Why can I only select a single paragraph in the draft editor of my content? No doubt there's some reasonable technical argument for this that engineering makes every time the product team brings it up. In practice, the result is the 500 word draft with a list in the middle will take me 10 minutes to copy/paste out of the Medium app into Editorial. Please don't make me feel stupid."
1556,SimoneGardner,"August 8, 2016",5,"Love the app This is works great. More fun to use than the website. Love reading content from people all over, some within the establishment circle, but most outside of it. One of the best places to find new and courageous ideas, I think."
1557,TommySTL,"February 12, 2017",5,"A never-ending source of great information I've never reviewed a news app, but Medium is by far the most addicting news app I've come across. The web of information has tied up most of my weekend and only led me to want more. It's a great find."

1560,william_schmidt,"November 8, 2015",5,I've tried them all! This app is a rare genuine app. It provided content that I want and not what I find myself scrolling through all the time. Such a well thought through all and I hope it continues to be that way
1561,Gtb5uva,"January 24, 2016",5,"Amazing I got on medium a week ago and I'm totally hooked. They are simply the best platform of this type- and I'm impressed with all of the features their mobile app has, as well as all of the great functionality for reading and writing."

1573,TheWriteThinker,"February 16, 2016",5,"My new reading addiction--fantastic!! LOVE Medium! A treasure trove of great and mediocre writing that is a lot like a dating scene--some you connect with; others not so much, but exciting and interesting enough to keep one coming back over and over again out of curiosity."
1574,Alexbateman,"February 20, 2016",5,"Best use of my time Rather than constantly refreshing Facebook to see content that is neither informational or interesting, I can open up Medium and get an endless supply of material that adds value to my life. Love it Medium, keep up the good work."
1575,jackiehonikman,"February 26, 2016",4,"Medium is awesome, the iOS app is almost awesome. Love Medium but the iOS app is a little buggy for writing as opposed to browsing/reading. For example, if you select text to edit and select ""cut"" (instead of copy or paste) it deletes your text but doesn't also copy it so you can paste it somewhere else."
1576,NeneBee9,"June 22, 2016",5,"Great app for readers and writers I found Medium when I was recovering from cancer surgery and didn't want to watch tv all day.

1580,RobertCarleton,"May 4, 2014",5,Changed my life This is the hands down best app I have ever used. Reading stories from intelligent people has been inspiring and life changing and contributing has done the same. I actually feel dumber when I use Facebook now.

And no one is inviting you to play an insipid game."
1594,Anirudhananda123,"August 7, 2016",5,"Worth your time This app has changed my reading habit completely. The  little feature that tells you how much time a read will take , has converted my reading time into a competitive yet life changing habit ."

When I'm in the app and have been scrolling through my feed for a while, if I go to another app or browser and come back, Medium refreshes itself and now I'm all the way back at the top and need to restroom through everything. This is really annoying and I think it should be fixed."

1610,TouchOfGray,"March 21, 2014",3,"Requires Twitter account to access Enjoyed medium's website until it—and their app—required a Twitter account to access.

1615,Astormflocetc,"December 19, 2015",5,"Finally! A place for sophisticated opinion! It's not quite news and not quite tabloid... Medium has somehow managed to create a platform that attracts and maintains a level of sophistication that cannot be found in today's world of infinite opinions. The freedom of user-op-ed and the eloquence of ""The Believer"" or ""Salon."""

1637,LaurieBIdaho,"May 3, 2017",5,Daily dose of wisdom & information Medium has literally changed my life in the way I think by the inspiring posts from other writers and bloggers. Always find useful information or food for thought
1638,DarkStorm13,"June 3, 2017",1,The redesign made it harder to get content I loved the plain feed of stories on the old design. This new home screen makes it extremely hard to find interesting stories. Every time I open the app I have to find a way to navigate to a place that some feed of stories. 
1639,Mya Juliet,"August 8, 2017",5,Simple and easy Medium is simple to use and easy on the eyes. I like everything about it :) I wish there is an option for me to download all my published content into my computer.

1641,wellreadsaint,"October 8, 2015",5,Impressed Had kind of given up on blogging -- writing or reading them. But Medium seems to be taking it in a fresh direction and allowing people to hear interesting voices. The app is also polished and fun. Check this out!
1642,teaneedz,"October 9, 2015",2,Buggy and not fully baked App does not always sync with posts edited from the web. The new post option does not always display on the bottom menu bar requiring frequent steps back in navigation to reach it. The followers/following in the profile section does not expand. Links in Markdown syntax are not always rendered as clickable URLs. Medium still does not support Markdown.
1643,Zach3306,"February 3, 2016",5,Awesome app! The whole concept of medium is awesome and I have enjoyed reading posts on the site for a while now. The experience in the app is amazing and makes enjoying the content on Medium even more enjoyable than before.
1644,Lolololololololololololo0,"May 8, 2016",5,Great app I recently discovered this app and now I read a few stories every single day. The only thing I don't like is that when I wrote a post it's hard to format some of the paragraphs the way I want.

1656,ADDGurl,"April 22, 2017",4,Great and varied resource Love the content. Also love to read the comments because they are mostly intelligent and or rye. However can't figure why comments are available to read on some articles but not accessible on others.

As a reader, Korean font size is too big to read. It is huge problem to Korean writers when they choose an writing platform. If Medium adjust the font size more Korean writers and readers will love it."

1699,Troglazore,"May 30, 2017",4,"Good app, but not great for programming articles I love medium as a reader, but as an author the lack of footnotes is very annoying.

1712,Thaonp279,"May 16, 2016",5,It's like TED for writing I love how the community here all wants to inspire other people with what they have learned in life. I have learned so much since I downloaded this app. It's my number 1 platform to seek for deep insight on current matter.

1749,333hecate,"September 9, 2017",5,Quality content A phenomenal medium for quality content. The APP keeps me focused on reading the material I desire without sending me all over the web. It's like my private peaceful reading room.
1750,Quoindesign.com,"June 19, 2015",2,"Great website. Bad app. So much is missing: comments, especially. But what I can't forgive is the inflexibility of being forced to read often highly visual content in portrait mode. And you can't zoom. "
1751,Christy2772,"August 3, 2015",5,"Love it I have never written a review of a app before, but this one is so good i actually want to. The app works well, never crashes or slows down my phone. It has great articles to read, and a neat clean layout."
1752,achen0909,"October 14, 2015",5,"Well polished app for well polished writing The pieces curated on Medium are top notch with a thoughtful community. The app is also very cleanly built. Videos embedded in articles can glitch a little sometimes. Other than that, Medium is an amazing app."
1753,Oliviaxix,"October 20, 2015",5,"Satisfying This app is more than just an app. It's,healthy, food for the soul if you know how to sort through valid information. Definitely enjoyable to read with my morning coffee."

1755,timidblu31,"March 13, 2016",5,"❤️ I love this on so many levels. I have found inspiration, insight, and sometimes a different view on things. "
1756,The DR,"March 16, 2016",4,"Great articles, with sometimes too much pop filler I love stumbling upon articles about little known subjects and Medium is a great place for that. While they do have some click-bait articles, it does not take away from the great writing by the contributors."
1757,John Cason 1986,"March 20, 2016",3,"Great content, App Crashes I love Medium- great content and easy to share parts of stories. However, the app crashes all the time. I keep coming back for the content, but the browser is a better experience. I'm on a iPhone 6s & have tried closing all other apps, but still crashes."
1758,jwordsmith,"March 28, 2016",5,"Beautiful, thought provoking Medium seems to have realized its goal of being a place online for thought-provoking content.  The app itself is clean and beautiful and the content easy on the eyes."
1759,Cardboard Tube Knight,"March 28, 2016",5,"Really fun and informative. It's like a streaming service of blogs. I find so many opinions in line with mine, but presented in new, interesting ways. I also get to see another side of things and expose my own writing."
1760,Noahkirsch,"November 25, 2014",3,"Better Before the update While the list style display is nice for the top 20 articles, I was disappointed to see that an endless list has replaced the previous side swiping. That feature was what made the medium app more elegant and more enjoyable to use than other apps."
1761,Eric2566322,"December 8, 2014",1,"Swipe functionality is gone I all but stopped using the website when they took away the skip-to-next-article feature. Because Medium is such a great platform for longer, more involved articles, it is incredibly important to give users the ability to skip to a new article part way through. Removing the swipe was a huge mistake."
1762,Ad6419,"September 24, 2016",5,"Perfect This app is perfection for anyone who loves to read or write. Start or end the day. This connects to every facet of life; work, day dreaming, self-improvement, illness... the list is endless... here, you will feel at home."
1763,Maryannp,"December 29, 2016",4,"You may find yourself, or lose yourself While reading Medium. Either, or both will be worthwhile and probably enjoyable. You may lose track of time. My favorite destination for a wander about with words and thoughts."
1764,Angae,"January 15, 2017",5,"A positive time sink... Facebook, etc. are filled with so many negative comments and although you can hide individuals I never leave feeling inspired. Here I do and that says everything."
1765,jpherbal24,"March 6, 2017",5,"Great Articles Instead of playing games, why now read something on this they could improve your life!"
1766,OP Miami,"March 29, 2017",5,Great reading app I love how this app because it quickly matches me up with preferred topics but then surprises me with articles that I wouldn't necessarily seek out but are also of interest. 
1767,7846432196380421,"May 9, 2017",5,"intelligent twitter Deep and interesting writing from a variety of sources, but it will take some time to adjust your filters. Some articles are trite, but some, and their comments, are thought-provoking gems."
1768,Adam Sinda,"May 16, 2017",5,"Great for Designers I'm constantly using this app to find new trends and tools for Sketch, principle, and the adobe suite. I highly recommend this app to aspiring designers or anyone looking to become better at what they do/love."
1769,UmarDeblaze,"June 22, 2017",4,"Good but... I enjoy reading on this app a lot. I just wish it allowed me to copy texts easily. Also, I'm  poor student so paying for it isn't much of an option. I'd wager I'll get the full paid app when I'm done with school and with a proper job."
1770,VinciDaMan,"October 11, 2015",5,"Medium Review Outstanding. I was growing frustrated with not being able to work on my stories cross-platform. With the new update, I can do that and more. I am quite pleased with the ease of operation as well."
1771,Rich_Dub,"November 15, 2015",3,"Great app but has some usability issues I love Medium and the content - but there are some things about it either a) I can't figure out or b) don't exist - one of those is editing a highlight if it was done on accident. Where does it go? I can find the list of them, but can't do anything about it."
1772,Gmnorris88,"December 4, 2015",5,"Great app. Simple clean and to the point I love this app. Your posts popularity isn't predicated on wether your a ""famous"" person. It's geared towards quality content over everything else. Slowly becoming addicted."
1773,MC Abel,"January 13, 2016",4,Medium Rocks! For the most part the Medium app rocks. Easier to use & navigate than the previous version. As always the content shines. Just one problem!  How the heck do you revise your profile.  I've tried multiple times.
1774,matterismental,"May 2, 2016",5,"A plethora of quality content! This app acts as a portal into some of the most thoughtful, well-intentioned, helpful content anywhere on the web right now. The interface is clean, simple, and unobtrusive."
1775,corinnejayp,"July 31, 2016",5,"Suuuuch a great app This app is incredible-- it brings me so much peace and clarity as I'm able to write my thoughts and read the thoughts of others. It definitely opens your eyes and allows you to ""walk in someone's shoes""."

As an avid reader and writer it is the perfect mish mosh of everything you want from tech to politics; poetry to prose; how-tos to don't-dos.

1779,oliviagainey,"September 11, 2017",5,"An Amazingly Human Writing Platform I've only had the app for a half hour and I am hooked. The stories that Medium's incredibly insightful users have to share are thought-provoking and never bland. Thanks, Medium!"
1780,ohhjamesk,"October 8, 2015",5,"Great app The stories are all well written and genuine. I finally have a ""news"" app that isn't full of articles that are written by people who are paid by companies to feed me crap."
1781,Riilifast,"October 9, 2015",4,"One more thing All thing is very beautiful and useful but i want one more thing that is read it later button, some articles interesting me but i have no time read it at the moment."
1782,Arghyawn,"October 11, 2015",5,I'm hooked. The recommended articles based off of the categories I chose are spot on. Can't stop bookmarking articles and liking almost every article I come across.
1783,Diargon,"November 14, 2015",5,Procrastination via Reading Medium makes me study while I'm procrastinating studying. It makes me want to research more and more. 
1784,Lefstathiou,"February 18, 2016",4,Big fan I am really enjoying medium. Only issue is that I can login over a period of days and see the same recommended articles but I find their interest algorithm to be effective at recommending things I want to read.
1785,posixoddity,"February 29, 2016",5,"Really solid app, from a great team They sweat the details, and it shows. The medium app has a ton of thought put into how it works. Makes using it to read posts an awesome experience."

1789,Njrick,"January 14, 2017",5,"Great app, even greater content Medium is a terrific way to read others opinion on almost any topic.  Instead of a quick Facebook post, you get actual cohesive thoughts!  Amazing!"
1790,C#J#,"December 22, 2014",1,"Not fun, kind of an embarrassment. Former version of this app had internet connectivity woes for me. On my new phone it works. The app lacks a lot of functionality, it doesn't embed things correctly like tweets, it also has no back gesture which seems small but gets infuriating kind of quick because the articles  are long. I hope this gets fixed? I don't actually know if I care."
1791,Dave schools,"August 18, 2015",5,"The only place I write I love editor, begin all my writing on medium, and then export from there. It feels beautiful to write on medium. Intuitive and brilliant. Reading on medium is just as great, unique thoughtful content written by talented writers. Medium is only going to grow."
1792,FMLPhotography,"August 19, 2015",2,"Great content, hard to navigate Medium has the ability to follow authors but outside of pressing the follow button, that seems to be the end of the interaction.   There doesnt seem to be a way to pull up those you follow, or restrict your feed to just those people's posts.    It makes it difficult to keep track of the authors that I enjoy."
1793,TexasRed11,"October 8, 2015",2,"Hardly a ""News"" app I would hardly consider this a news app. It's more of a breeding ground for biased articles written by people who really have no business writing, them if we're being quite honest. However, there is value if you enjoy a blog-style article. Although if that's the case there are better sites for that too."
1794,mINatl,"December 13, 2016",5,"Great experience Love the functionality. Easy to use, easy to share, bookmark , etc. Great on mobile and desktop.  And the 🔑? The diverse, thoughtful content that's easy to engage with. Thanks!"
1795,Germany10042008,"December 30, 2016",4,Great app with one big missing feature Works well and is very close to the website experience (optimize in many great ways for mobile). BUT it could really use a dark/night mode.
1796,Uibrian,"April 5, 2017",5,Relevant content stat! So far my experience is great. I'm consuming more relevant content and even seeing articles from some of my friends. I'm less distracted and more productive. Not bad. Not bad at all.
1797,dshafer,"April 20, 2017",5,"Medium is Great! So's this App!! Medium might just have the best fit between it's portable app and its core technology. The us is seamless and snappy and intuitive. Without the iOS app, I'd spend far less time on the site for sure."
1798,jillybeanz3,"June 15, 2017",5,"If the NYT op-ed was an entire paper Mean that in a good way - not always hard-hitting, but excellent range in topics and opinions. Enjoy reading about sports, self-improvement and diversity and tech all in one place. Personalized recommendations are great too."
1799,Atrebor52,"September 12, 2017",5,"Great thought provoking articles! I never open an email from Medium without finding at least one, usually more, article that intrigues me, teaches me something, or enlightens me in someway. Terrific curating of lesser known voices!"

Downloaded the app on my iPad. Gave it my gmail acct, got the sign up email, open the link, nothing. Cut & paste the link nothing. Repeated this 2 more times, once for my iPhone, same result, cannot create an account. It must be me, so take this review with a huge asterisk."

1867,wasted 15$,"March 24, 2017",5,"Brings me joy Medium is unique. There are very few spaces on the web with such a vibrant and positive community, and intelligent contributors. If you are a writer, Medium is the perfect platform for you to get your first tastes of publishing. It feels like home."
1868,Jasperblu67,"April 20, 2017",5,"Rabbit Hole of Awesome Love the UI/UX, yes yes, of course! But the content is what I keep going back for. All the deep deliciousness of Reddit, (mostly) without the trolls and mansplaining. Highly recommend folks get a dose of Medium daily, IMO it will make us all better people."
1869,ChicaLorena,"June 6, 2017",5,Great content from great writers! Medium is my one-stop shop when I'm looking for quality content or when I'm ready to publish my own writing. It's a win-win for authors and readers!

1871,jhietter,"September 23, 2015",5,The app recedes into the background so the focus remains on content. I have been using this app for about a month and so far I haven't run into any pressure points.
1872,andrewconard,"October 25, 2015",5,Visual and Literary Beauty Medium is a wonderful example of the essential link between form and function. It excels as a place to both write and read. The design is minimal and intuitive. I feel smarter reading Medium.
1873,ulmdz1988,"December 24, 2015",5,Very inspiring This app is awesome because you get to read a lot of news content. Plus you can write about anything you want and inspire others.

1880,Gage Parker,"October 19, 2014",1,Logging in should not be a science project I'd give zero stars if I could.  Web site via safari doesn't work well on iPad (bizarro sudden screen shifts to the left that can't be undone except by going back to the top of an article). Somehow app version is even worse.  If you want me to login in with Twitter be prepared to handle that sites approach to 2-factor authentication and don't give obscure obtuse error messages
1881,Hexawise,"January 17, 2017",5,"Great content. Great app. Easily accessible stories and ""up voted"" blog posts from authors that you're bound to be interested in. This is what the experience of reading blog posts is supposed to be like."

1885,De1princess,"July 4, 2017",5,Never dull I love the fiction. I also like the commentary. There is very little that I don't like on medium. Know that I like being challenged and shown an angle that I've missed. Medium is one of my favorite rabbit holes to fall into.

1890,Astroboy483,"February 17, 2016",5,"Good app The app works fine.  The best part is the content.  These are short reads from writers looking for an audience.  The writing ranges from ok to great.  I'm hooked on the ""open the present"" feeling I get opening this app."

1922,Science lover lv,"June 4, 2015",3,Finally you can write...as long as you finish I must be missing something but it seems that even though now you can write new posts you can't edit existing drafts. So...that's neat. I love medium but their iPhone app has missed the mark on every version. One day...
1923,CinisterxD,"June 17, 2015",4,Can they fix the app up more!? I love this app so much but the fact that they're missing so many necessities for the app like where to publish your story or seeing comments. They really need to add it to the app and soon

The authors that are predominantly featured - such as Michael Moore and the likes, are so in the tank for Hildebeast and other liberal wackos that I can't stomach it any more.  If you have any inkling of conservatism or moral decency, save yourself the frustration of Medium. I gave it one star, only because I couldn't give it zero."

Good idea, Trash execution."
1987,Johnny S 1463,"December 10, 2016",5,"Great app, great platform I love Medium. As someone who became self disgusted with how much time I spent idling on Facebook in a commonly fruitless search for thought provoking content, Medium has been such a breath of fresh air. Thank you!"

2020,Shazamuua,"March 24, 2014",4,"Good but not great Perfect for reading, however needs some sort of home screen-refresh button. An index navigation tool would be great, and a proprietary comment system would be nice (solely for medium users)."
2021,DorieB99,"August 27, 2015",4,"Fantastic App Medium does a wonderful job with an elegant interface, updates, UX, (did I say UI?) & content feed. Update notes actually contain useful info as opposed to ""Download this update, don't ask questions. We know what's best for you."" "

2023,jimmyny66,"November 10, 2015",3,Great UI but lacking total functionality App is great and love the UI however there are some downfalls. You can't edit your followers and see who's following you on the app. Also you can't edit your profile. Big keys to a great functioning app. Please fix

2038,WileyReb,"August 24, 2017",1,"Sad to say, not going to pay Medium has attracted a diverse collection of writers. Found myself reading about topics I'd normally never see, let alone take time to read, and applauding the brief experiences the authors delivered. However, there is only so much time in a day and with the digital world dropping a virtual library in my lap, I will return to another floor in this library if yours requires a toll to gain entry."

2051,MrLefever,"February 9, 2016",5,Love it but missing one major thing I love using Medium!!! One of the biggest things that it is missing is offline reading. Id love to use it when I'm on the subways underground in NYC.
2052,Danielson1026,"March 3, 2016",4,"Loving it so far Great app, clean design. Feels like I'm getting an insider's view into subjects I care about, like sales, tech, SaaS, startups, etc. needs a bit more moderation. There are some blatant adverts - are they meant to be there? Saucony ads displayed as a user post?"
2053,Nic.Wise,"April 26, 2016",4,Nice improvement since last time I tried it. Nice way to read longer form articles. Much much better since they supported landscape.
2054,GBFTW,"May 21, 2016",5,This is a great app with content curated to your taste. Worth checking out if you enjoy a good read and sharing that content with other like minded people.
2055,NailTekk,"July 22, 2016",5,"Great app for reading on the go Medium is a crowdsourced blogging, much as Wikipedia is crowdsourced information. You can search for topics and even publishers. Great stuff. Start your own Medium blog today!"

2062,J. Byron,"May 18, 2014",3,"In the right Direction This is app really cool, but not being able write from it and do other things that you can from the non-mobile website really kills the awesomeness of it. Fixing that should be a primary objective."
2063,vaznv,"August 25, 2014",1,"No navigaton The idea is simple and yet challenging, and I respect that. I love to read Medium on my browser but this mobile app is hardly usable. It's okay to get rid of 'Home' but how can I get out of a writer profile? I have been locked in someone's profile since the day I installed this app, and my patient grew thin. I hope that this app will be updated soon, for now I have to uninstall it."
2064,Mohit Deshpande,"September 13, 2014",1,"Not iPad optimized. No way to navigate This is just a big screen iPhone app. It's is not optimized to take any advantage of the iPads big screen space. Also there is no way to navigate through the app. That the most important feature that it needs. I don't want to read the things that medium throws at me, I want to read the things that I select!"
2065,medieval42,"March 25, 2015",2,No portrait mode ? I've been using Medium for a while now via their web UI. Finally decided to give the app a spin. First thing that I found quite annoying was lack of rotation to portrait mode. I use a bluetooth keyboard with my iPad and this really is unacceptable. I will just continue to use the web UI.
2066,MikeSe86,"June 26, 2015",4,Like the concept Learned about the site through the app and overall really like the concept of what makes the site. No issues with the app.
2067,Allie Dearest,"July 31, 2015",3,Refreshing But Needs to Refresh I love the look of the app but it didn't automatically refresh my profile text from Twitter or my article after edits. I had to manually change the profile text.
2068,FTorresMSc,"December 17, 2015",4,"Great way to catch up on your interests The Medium model of managing  content makes it a breeze to focus only on your interests, and the highlights / responses system is innovative and enforces relevant comments only.   Check it out"

2078,ShePlaysGuitar,"April 24, 2017",5,"A cacophony of talented thinkers, creatives & writers A good forum for tapping in to a current of voices which otherwise would go unheard.  Dig deep though, because cream doesn't always rise to the top, it's underneath the sea, too."

2081,Xenprecs,"June 27, 2014",4,"Icon Weirdness on iPad mini Love the app, but since the latest update some of the icons have been looking either pixelated or not optimized on my first generation iPad mini. Otherwise keep up the good work!"
2082,TheMasterslave,"November 24, 2014",2,2 Steps Backward Nooooooo!!!!! Not another app with endless scrolling. Simply put you had it right to begin with. And making the user open the article to see est reading time? Huge bummer. Couldn't you at least still display that from the scroll list? Predict I lose interest now.
2083,Organic coffee,"September 2, 2015",4,"Good, but where are my drafts? Pretty good UI. Would like to see parity with features on the Medium website, like being able to access and edit my draft posts."
2084,Andy Gathman,"November 2, 2015",3,"Excited by the app but... Was thrilled to find this, a potential community of writers and readers to share ideas, stories. I see lots of potential here but why is there no way to add or change your profile pic? Am I just not finding it???"

2086,Jeremy J Anderson,"February 17, 2016",4,"Medium is the best, the app is decent The app is fine, it feels a bit unresponsive occasionally, but I love Medium too much to rate it below four stars. I also don't give five stars to much of anything. Solid app, great place to write."

2095,shootmyshot,"February 8, 2017",5,Great content and very cool app There's no shortage of strong content on Medium and I love the app. It's super easy to use and customize. Worth your time. But I do wonder what happened to Matter Studios? 🤔

2097,Ambrose Little,"March 25, 2017",5,Relevant and Authentic Medium has captured a way to connect people of similar interests with very little ritual/overhead and then to foster meaningful exchange of ideas and stories throughout those connections.

2110,Bob3001Odyssey,"November 22, 2016",5,I dig it So far I like it. It seems like it's still a social media platform in its liquid state. Let's hope it doesn't become an echo chamber of shadow banning and censorship for a political slant.
2111,⌘Q,"January 20, 2017",1,"Pretty much useless Looks good, but if you try to use this app in a edgy connection, good luck reading the article. Images are lazy loaded so if you don't have any internet after loading a post with images, nothing will work. Also if you accidentally navigate away, the post is no longer there. Use the website."

So I clicked on it and read the first half of the first paragraph, at which point it said, “You have reached your limit of free articles.

The platform does a good job surfacing pertinent content that is relevant to me, and outside of the app, the email digests are fantastic. Keep it up, Medium!! I'm a happy premium member."

3934,ghostrunner25,"September 2, 2019",2,"Paywall around bias articles With many intriguing headlines I began to read their clickable content months ago. They do a good job curating and presenting.  Is it worth $5 / month? Perhaps. However, despite the diversity of content creators they still force feed the same opinion bias baked in to the product that you already get from CNN, NYT, BBC, NPR content. What a waste of an opportunity.  More of the same with even naked calls for your vote at the end of an article. (Progress-left redistribution candidates only, please.)  As they’ve already had to lay off half the staff and add a paywall it’s clear the market doesn’t find this all that compelling and half the folks who built the good parts have been shown the door already.  Maybe one of them will come out with a better App in a 6 months."

3942,Vincent Jenks,"November 1, 2018",2,"Invasive and unnecessary I think Medium itself is fantastic. Easily the best blogging platform ever, but the app just gets in the way. I read a ton of tech news and much of it comes from Medium. Every time I tap a link, I don’t want to be forced to launch the app, I just want to read it in my browser, be able to bookmark it, or just keep it open in a tab for later. More than any other app I’ve seen, this one just gets in your face. It’s obnoxious, so I always end up removing it, be it iOS or Android. Logging in via the browser, there’s nothing I can’t do in the app, so it’s useless to me anyhow. I gave it two stars because the app is well built and does it’s job, otherwise I would have given one for how forcefully I’m driven to it."

I read a lot of long technical pieces with code and I linger on them a while. Sure, I guess I could bookmark everything when I start reading, but sometimes I am interrupted unexpectedly and then lose the article. Of course, I am probably doing it wrong but I can’t see any resolution to this issue. I’ve trying logging in via my laptop browser and see if there is a reading history, but I don’t see one."

4000,@mmjude,"July 1, 2017",5,"Innovative Platform, Cutting-edge Engineering and a Remarkably Dynamic Company Culture My experience with this app and the community sparked by A Medium Corporation has been phenomenally life changing. As I departed from the hustle of wordpressing my publications together, I was warmly welcomed into the thought provoking and visually distinctive ideation and writers platform, Medium. "
4001,EKWise,"July 13, 2017",5,"You won't regret the download. This isn't a news platform and it's not the typical social media app you're used to. That's a good thing. To me, Medium is a place to find the best bloggers and ""print"" content-creators out there. When it comes to content creation today, many people focus on the visual -- YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. -- but the written word is still valuable. So download it now, and I promise you won't regret it."

4012,The M.A.B.,"March 1, 2017",4,The future ... Medium should really partner with amazon. Medium on Kindle is low key the future of information and technology making the perfect synthesis.
4013,Rahul Bhalley,"April 26, 2017",4,Gist GitHub problem Although the app is good but the only problem I'm experiencing right now is that the GitHub Gist code doesn't show up in iPhone. All I see is a link to GitHub Gist code.
4014,jcr4317,"May 1, 2017",4,"I like Medium, and want it to avoid the usual pitfalls... When Medium first started, it seemed to me that it had the potential to be to blogging sites what Vimeo was to YouTube: civil and aesthetically more interesting versions of their raucous cousins. YouTube still has a whole lot more content than Vimeo and so I still use it, and there are other places to read essays that are a lot more interesting than the bulk of the things on Medium. And after a pretty civil beginning for the site, I see a lot more trolls on Medium than there used to be. But I still have hope for Medium, and, by extension, for the Internet at large. A place for civil discourse on the Internet? Maybe it's a pipe dream, but we have to keep trying."

4016,Cee Em Zee,"June 4, 2017",4,Discover new writers and ideas This makes it so easy to find voices otherwise buried on disparate blogs.and journals. Disappointed by the redesign as it condenses the new material from writers and blogs I follow into a list of headlines... definitely less visually and practically appealing.
4017,Fixthisapp!!,"June 9, 2017",5,"The year 2067 -- 50 years from now. Greetings former *snicker* thumb user. I am from your near future. Right after the great informational collapse destroyed the cancer of narcissism infecting the arc of destiny.  I find it strange this rating idea. Qualitative assessments predicated upon personal interaction is the very thing that is about to destroy you -- surely you see it. But, such we had been gamed. "
4018,ZWSS1234,"June 12, 2017",5,Incredible Platform I enjoy writing but feel like the blogosphere has died out. Thankfully Medium brings it back to life for me and inspired me to write and read blogs again. Highly recommended @zeidwsalman
4019,IdEgoSuperego,"June 23, 2017",1,"The App is worse than useless now... Having the convenient home screen with new story updates for my favorite publications was extremely helpful. Now, with the most recent version, I get a confusing list of articles in no particular order. Did I miss an article? Who knows? I certainly don't know. Even if I look at a specific publication like Think Progress none of the articles are in order. They are categorized in a way that seems specifically designed to make me miss new articles unless I scroll through pages of repeats because a certain article covers both Climate and Politics. Congratulations, you've taken something useful and ruined it. It will be deleted as soon as I send this review."
4020,TheCeeJayLouis,"February 20, 2016",4,"Only four stars because You guys need to make it so that stories can be saved offline. I lost a draft of a really great article because I was in a venue where there was no cell signal or wifi and mistakenly took notes on this app only to discover to my horror that all my meticulous recordings were gone. Finito. Zip. I tweeted @medium and was told, ""It's in the road map."" What?! This is a huge oversight! It should've been in there at the getgo. Fix it, please. Yesterday."
4021,ProPotato,"February 21, 2016",5,Great as Medium.com I do enjoy reading on Medium iOS app as well as its update logs.
4022,📱iPhone user,"April 9, 2016",1,Bug fixes occur all too frequently The Medium app is updated all too frequently for bug fixes. What I want to know is this: why don't your app programmers test their code before releasing it?  This way you can fix your errors before releasing them to the public.

4025,JenniferPerie,"August 17, 2016",5,"Expression Without End By JenniferPerie  Medium offers everything for both the reader, the writer - actually for anyone who desperately yearns for the variety of communication Medium offers. It's so expansive - I'm fascinated by the life stories & writings by others. So much to discover!  Best of all, for this shy writer, I'm beginning to feel nudges towards freeing up my writing. The impact this has on my soul is unprecedented for me... & I know I'm not alone in this. Medium has a generosity, an accessibility, which gently enriches & encourages all.  It's invaluable."
4026,Lovely_Dayz88,"November 15, 2016",4,"Awesome outlet for the shy and the brave! I love the articles, day in and day out, that speak up or speak to many who can't or won't say something because of fear or anger! Great to know we all can write and share with out concern of what we will say or who we say it to!"

4030,ILOVEKOTOBA!,"February 19, 2015",2,"So many issues This app fails in a number of ways. First, the user interface isn't exactly in line with iOS standards. It's the typical work of ux guys who've never developed a line of objective-c code. Second, the whole Twitter/Facebook login right off the bat seems really misguided. Users should be able to consume content anonymously. Now granted there is value for medium in knowing who their users are, perhaps offer something of greater value in exchange for signing up with Facebook (e.g. Access to premium content from trusted sources). Third and lastly, I actually think Medium should do more to improve the writing style of its contributing author. The Hemingway browser app could be a good start when typing drafts. Also, the credentials of writers are not clear enough in this app; I wish they made it more clear as to why I should read an author's work."
4031,Ceohockey60,"May 11, 2015",2,"Can't share on Twitter Nice reading app except everytime I try to share on Twitter, it says my connection to Twitter failed.Seeing how Medium's CEO founded Twitter, this is a bit ironic. Please fix!"
4032,richarolo,"August 27, 2015",1,"needs work Update: you're asking me to run your code on my device, I expect you to take it seriously.  When you update that code I expect a clear, concise, and complete description of the changes you're making to that code.  I don't want to read a stupid story in the release notes section.  If I wanted to read a story I'd open the app."
4033,akahigezardoz,"October 9, 2015",2,No landscape mode?  Seriously? Would it be so hard to code a landscape mode for this app?  I don't think it would.  You should.
4034,consultSKI,"October 23, 2015",4,"Close to great. Let's call it better than expected. I love Kindle Reader on my iPhone... in fact, I do 80% or more of my reading on my phone. I got excited about Medium in a big way when I could see the same great content on the phone AND the desktop. This is one aspect that digital publishing in the Apple Newsstand does not address. Plus the ability to point someone to a page or passage of text inside a larger document. Shame on iTunes. Therefore, I am moving a few projects over to Medium. However the iPhone App for Medium lacks the ability to highlight AND share that passage of text via social media. Amazon has had this feature for YEARS. What gives? Hence my 4 out of 5 stars."

4043,Titusbartos,"August 16, 2014",1,Absolutely useless UX It seems that the medium team designed it for them to use internally rather than for the general public who just wants to discover new reads. A complete turn off to new medium users and a disappointment for those of us who are excited about medium's potential and website accomplishments. 
4044,Markymark328,"December 27, 2014",1,"Great content. Terrible UX With this iteration, Medium removed every discernible form of navigation. The app is unusable. Surprised by this @Ev. Bringing back swipe-based navigation will greatly help."
