0,Tia Lorraine,"March 20, 2020",3,"Meh, it‚Äôs just OK. Not as accessibility user friendly as Facebook I really enjoy using Twitter, as a resource to connect with other authors, writers, and book lovers. However, because I barely have any eyesight, I have to use the voice over. I have seen the option in Settings, that allows Twitter to describe photos for blind and visually impaired users. I turn that setting on, and it doesn‚Äôt work. I also wish Twitter could describe a Animated giffs. Instead, my I-phone‚Äôs voiceover just says‚Äù I Animated gif‚Äù. There is also frequent bouts of glitchiness, between Twitter and my iPhone‚Äôs dictate button. The dictate button would work in my other apps, but when using it on Twitter, it sometimes does this funky 3-toned thing, and I have to hit it more than once to get it to transcribe what I say. Then other times when I use dictate on Twitter, it capitalizes the first letter of every single word. When I am lucky enough to notice this, I have to erase the whole tweet and type it all over again manually. That gets very tedious and annoying, because we voiceover users have two double tap each character and space as we type. My other complaints are, sometimes I can‚Äôt respond to others tweets that were posted from the Twitter web app. When I try to give a Like, or reply, it just bumps me back to my home page. Lastly, for some glitchy reason, my mobile app won‚Äôt let me play peoples videos. Especially not the ones that are posted on the Web app. So that is why I gave it three stars."
1,PatLanganJordan,"April 25, 2020",5,"Real News When I Choose! When I was 27, my life fell apart. I was holding on by a thread. I was in such emotional pain, I also took on everyone else‚Äôs pain around me. Watching the news was so heartbreaking, it made day to day function even more difficult. I realized then, ‚ÄúThe News‚Äù was all about bringing all the horrors of life to the surface with a continual loop of the most sensational and horrific pain. I had to turn off the TV, cancel the news paper and even stop reading magazine covers. "

4,ShaolinsDragon,"March 5, 2020",5,"üê•Twitter‚Äôs Paradox ü¶â After finding my way to Twitter under random mysterious circumstances lol I just chalked it up to the universe wanting me here. I still struggle with Social Media but I must admit...I‚Äôm enjoying my time here, reading updated news (factual news & by choice), reading little thoughts by random people like myself (Known & Unknown) it doesn‚Äôt matter to me and sharing my own whether they matter, have an impact or whatever else. It‚Äôs quite an interesting place. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm here now but with the awareness of not getting wrapped up in some ‚ÄúBad Troll‚Äù nonsense. Disinformation, bullies, negative arguments, name calling, fake accounts, identity theft...all reasons I‚Äôve avoided Twitter & social media for so long. But I‚Äôm trying. We‚Äôll give it a whirl and see where it lands. But overall...I like Twitter. Any medium or place where ideas, positive influences, inspiration, real news, jokes, fun & friendship can live happily...I‚Äôm all for it. I know you want to be a positive place Twitter. The internet is still new...we‚Äôll get it right one day. And I do know you‚Äôve taken massive efforts to keep it a positive place. We all need that. So thanks üôèüèΩ"
5,EvaFitts,"January 30, 2019",2,"Addicting in a Very Bad Way Twitter isn‚Äôt functional because you can‚Äôt easily remove followers.  Twitter doesn‚Äôt recognize that people have different needs over time. Many of us got on expressly to discuss politics. You follow and are followed by thousands of people.  Now you want to switch to your real name and focus on people doing a particular workout challenge or use the account for some other, less toxic reason.   You either have to delete the account, wait a period of time and start over (losing all your follows) or block every account you don‚Äôt want following you anymore, one at a time.  Twitter is full of bots supporting the right wing, far left extremists and fake accounts.  If you‚Äôre there for politics you can‚Äôt use your real name because you will be threatened and harassed. One person told me she could find out everything about me and ruin my life. Someone I follow used her real name and a harasser find out the name of the woman‚Äôs father‚Äôs business and filled yelp with negative reviews.   It can at times be a place for ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù or learning and even uplifting but it can also be a vile, depressing place."
6,brandii_m,"February 17, 2018",1,"Tech support is garbage, email support is garbage made my twitter account almost 10 years ago an was an avid user on that same account. i was using the app and then sat my phone down for about an hour. when i reopened the app they were asking me to log back in to verify my account. Seeing that I haven‚Äôt logged out of twitter i was confused as to why they started to ask me this.i‚Äôve had this account for a long time and the email address i signed up with is one that i no longer had access to. because of this i was unable to reset my password. i tried emailing tech support but they gave me some excuse saying that they couldn‚Äôt verify the account and that there was no other way that they could do so. they‚Äôve never asked me to do so before and i am very upset with tech support. i would‚Äôve rather talk to an actual person to explain my problem than send an email that they took a long time to respond to. so now im stuck trying to figure out what my old password was because i don‚Äôt want to create a new account. its been 2 weeks since this happened and im very disappointed with their service and lack of communication."
7,sorry4ever,"April 3, 2020",1,"Invasive I‚Äôm updating my review but keeping the old one: When I use the app, I rarely see the Twitter channels I want to follow. Instead, I see other things that I am not interested in. Yet, I get emails every single day, maybe even more than once a day, that contain bait for me to download the Twitter app again. The bait is usually from people or channels that I want to follow. So naturally I get tempted to download the app again. But I‚Äôm not going to do it because I don‚Äôt feel that I am being treated fairly. What kind of company would want to do that to their customers? PREVIOUS REVIEW:"
8,Tonkalynn,"February 9, 2019",2,"App is great until you need support I‚Äôve had twitter for about 8 years now and recently have been locked out of my account due to age restriction. I‚Äôm currently well over the age to have an account but due to EU regulation twitter combatted this by locking accounts made by people under the age of 13. Being from America, I don‚Äôt understand why that should affect my account yet here we are. However that‚Äôs not my biggest issue. I‚Äôve never had to use twitter support until my account got locked out but because there is no email or account not on twitter for twitter support, there is no way for me to contact the support team for help. If I try to submit a form, it says my account is locked. I can‚Äôt send a message because my account is locked. I made a new account but it will direct me to send a message from my locked account, which then proceeds to tell me I can‚Äôt submit a form from my locked account. Twitter support needs a serious revamp considering it‚Äôs only useful for people with WORKING accounts; if my account worked then I wouldn‚Äôt need to contact twitter support in first place!"
9,ackkevink,"February 7, 2019",1,"Perhaps this is a better way to get through to YOU I have been on Twitter for almost 10 years now, and I love the app. However, two weeks ago you sent me an email saying I supposedly violated the rules and I would be locked out of my account for 72 hours. Well guess what, it‚Äôs been 312 hours later and I‚Äôm still locked out with absolutely no contact from you whatsoever as to when I can get back in to my account!! I have tried several times filing an appeal as to the suspension, yet ZERO contact or answers from you AT ALL!! Did I say something harsh to someone, yes I admit that I did. I did NOT however promote any violence or supposed hate, or threaten someone‚Äôs life. I consider myself a conservative, and if that‚Äôs the problem you have, then just admit that‚Äôs the problem to me and everyone else and we can all move on. However if you allow a liberal or left leaning person to say whatever they want with no repercussions, then I‚Äôm afraid you are going to have a much bigger problem on your hands. So please, for the sake of humanity, just respond to me and tell me how long I‚Äôm going to be locked out for so at least I can move on."
10,Jacky2243,"September 28, 2018",1,"The struggle. I joined Twitter in 2011 and it has never given me trouble up until a few months ago. I decided to change my birthday to the actual date because when I created my Twitter I was just a couple of months away from turning 13; which was how old you needed to be to make a Twitter. A few months ago when I decided to change it my account was locked because it stated I wasn‚Äôt old enough at the time I created my account. It asked for an explanation and proof of age so in June I sent in a picture of my drivers license and explanation. It took about 4 weeks for the screen on my Twitter app to say that they were trying to figure out a solution to keep my tweet after I turned the age of 13 but I would get notified as soon as my Twitter was unlocked. It‚Äôs been almost 4 months since I should have been able to use twitter but my account is still locked. I‚Äôve logged out a few times, re-downloaded the app. Nothing has worked. They don‚Äôt have a service hotline to call either and fix this, this screen that has appeared won‚Äôt even let me submit another form. Very annoyed."
11,Nunu20026 on Twitter,"October 30, 2018",3,"I‚Äôm really irritated at this point!! Every time I try to takeoff the sensitive mode it doesn‚Äôt wanna take it off. I tried doing the instructions on Google I‚Äôve tried even just going through all the settings and change and everything differently and that‚Äôs not the half of it, I‚Äôve  had my account blocked or suspended just for following people I‚Äôve been suspended just for a re-tweeting a tweet I‚Äôve had so many problems with it and I just got it this month and it‚Äôs really aggravating and I had a couple of accounts but they were so long ago that I didn‚Äôt even remember the password to them and it was so hard just for me to delete them like I had to have a phone number I had to have a PIN number  or just something that was just dumb and stupid and wouldn‚Äôt just let me delete the accounts. But I successfully deleted them but I‚Äôm still having trouble with the sensitivity and I would really appreciated if you would fix it or something because I‚Äôve tried literally everything."
12,cliffor26917473,"December 28, 2018",3,Needs to be tweaked Twitter is not what it‚Äôs cracked up to be. While it is a good site and I enjoyed it as far as the making friends and the camaraderie and discussions. But after only being on the site for almost 3 months. Given her 24 hours Suspension then a one-week suspension for supposedly offensive tweets! Now I have been suspended for four months. Have no idea why. All attempts To get in touch with or communicate with Twitter have been in vain! All I get is the company line we will try to solve this within two or three days although it may take longer. And this is been for four months now! No courtesy of a reason why I was suspended no communication whatsoever! And anything I said on Twitter was not near as bad as some of the Liberals have put on there and still have their accounts. Would really like to have my Twitter account back but something needs to be done with some of the people who are letting their politics influence who is tweets they don‚Äôt like and suspend people for!
13,Kyxelplays,"April 13, 2019",4,"Glitch in DMs I got this glitch where it tells me a notification that someone is direct messaging me but when I go there, no one has messaged me and there‚Äôs nothing at all. I found a person who messaged me in the request section from my email later on but when I got to my Twitter account, it wasn‚Äôt there. So I blocked the person who sent me a message. But the notification in DMs is still there. No one has ever DMed me in the past weeks by now. I logged out and logged in, notification is still there. I deleted the app and reinstalled the app, it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve had this glitch notification for over a month or two. This annoyed me so much. It‚Äôs only my account that has this glitch, I don‚Äôt know to fix it."
14,chichikamish,"May 26, 2019",1,"They don‚Äôt care and it shows lol Like the title says they don‚Äôt actually do any work into moderating their site. You might think there‚Äôs someone out there reading the tweets that go out but if you search specific slurs you‚Äôll find a myriad of tweets with the n word or f word in them and twitter doesn‚Äôt bat an eyelash but get into a discussion with a pedophiliac apologist and tell them they are trash for condoning cp art well then they‚Äôre ready to ban or suspend your account. But to be perfectly honest I‚Äôm ok being banned from a site that offers a platform to racists, nazis, pedophiles, transphobia, and the absolute cesspool of society. I‚Äôm actually glad this has happened and made me realize what a piece of garbage this platform is. It might seem better than the tumblrs of the world and even facebook but is a smidgen better when it comes to social media? Just because it gives the appearance of giving a crap doesn‚Äôt mean it does and believe me, Twitter is no different than the facebooks of the world. They would sell you D list celebs selling flat tummy tea but you just have to have targeted ads on. Great service for a dumpster fire I guess..."
15,Jmar21,"October 4, 2019",1,"Exploited app There is an exploit on twitter that makes people accounts get permanently suspended. Absolutely no proof is necessary and all they have to do is send in tweets that pertain key words. My account i worked hard for after 11 years was banned due to this. No warning, no message from twitter other than ‚Äúyou broke twitter rules so you‚Äôre account is permanently suspended.‚Äù I‚Äôve appealed to twitter and contacted support but they have yet to answer. Makes absolutely no sense how someone can just ban an account without actual proof of the rule being broken. Twitter knows about this exploit and they have yet to address it. They ban the people doing nothing wrong but the ones that go against the ‚Äúpenalty of perjury‚Äù, end up scotch free. Twitter you need to fix this issue. Getting wrongfully banned is ridiculous and how this exploit isn't patched after months of having knowledge about it. Multi billion dollar company, and yet you have bots answer all questions and no actual human interaction. What‚Äôs the point of even having a number if all it does is point you back to an online source that still takes weeks to get a reply smh."
16,FFA girl,"April 22, 2020",2,"Better than nothing In general, I like Twitter. I joined it to see for myself what our President has to say. Mostly I read news articles. I retweet them and sometimes comment on others‚Äô posts. I seldom receive comments, likes, etc for the last couple of months. Doing some research, I‚Äôve learned that my replies are hidden below a bar called ‚Äúshow more replies‚Äù. This means no one will see anything I post unless they take an extra step to click on that bar. Essentially, I‚Äôm being censored and this is common practice on Twitter. I don‚Äôt know why because I don‚Äôt curse, I‚Äôm not hateful or abusive, and I don‚Äôt post fake news. The biggest issue I have with Twitter is the lack of support. I‚Äôve reached out for help several times to address the censorship issue to no avail. No response and no guidance regarding this ‚Äúdeboosting‚Äù that happens to many people, particularly conservatives. Twitter is biased, but allows me to see with my own eyes what the President is saying rather than being fed propaganda by the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù MSM. So, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs better than nothing."
17,January2Gomez,"December 15, 2019",2,"Very inconsistent in enforcing their own TOS I have noticed that ‚Äúverified accounts‚Äù, particularly of those espousing views of the far right, commit all kinds of egregious violations of terms of service, including harassment, threats, hateful conduct, doxxing, and in the case of at least one public official, intimidation of a witness, which is a felony. Yet Twitter allows these accounts to remain as subscribers; but if unknowns, particularly within the progressive community, peacefully express critical comments against even public officials (who should be prepared to accept them as part of their job), those unknowns get their accounts suspended! That double standard, coupled with CEO Jack Dorsey‚Äôs meeting with Trump, makes me wonder if he isn‚Äôt a Russian asset."
18,Devilthorn135,"November 3, 2019",5,"Opinion is mine. It‚Äôs a lot better than Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Tumbler, Tic-Toc, or anything else. The reason being that Twitter is for the highly intelligent people as philosophers and tweet out their ideas. Scientists can throw out new discoveries in 280 characters or less. There is a wealth of fact accounts which tweet old facts. Bots that do what ever that not was programmed to do. There are many webcomic artists and artists in general. News travels quicker around the country or world. Movie trailers, game trailers, show trailers, et cetra. This was my first social to media to own an account on, and for that reason it will be the most idealistic way to experience it. Trust me I‚Äôve been way more active in my iPhone‚Äôs account than my PC‚Äôs account. My PC‚Äôs account was my original while my iPhone‚Äôs account came second. Despite this you shouldn‚Äôt need any other social media to experience one like this."
19,Nitro Nateo,"April 4, 2020",1,"Toxicity Look I get it‚Äôs twitter, and the developers can‚Äôt do anything about this but honestly do not go on here unless you wish to be bitter and a political extremist. Thousands of dumb hashtags about trump and cheering because of the deaths so it ‚Äúowns the GOP‚Äù whenever there is a trend started by republicans that has more tweets it sinks to the bottom of the trends and all the one reply tweets screaming about Russian bots are there when you first click on it. The same 6-7 people replying to every political post, twitter deleting my like and retweet on JK Rowling‚Äôs controversial tweet about Maya, Christine Pelosi being protected on twitter after supporting a neighbor of a GOP senator who broke the senator‚Äôs lung but banning an actor who was showing true images of CNN host Andrew Gillum, intoxicated with meth and with male escorts. All the libs using those ‚Äútroll bot meters‚Äù that are literally just anti trump and blocking everyone who speaks out. You say we‚Äôre Russian bots but if we are we ain‚Äôt doing anything. Even if your on the left this will push to the extreme end, and conservatives will likely be pushed by harassment. Just don‚Äôt download the app, you‚Äôre life will be so much better."
20,rileysoccer1818,"July 11, 2018",1,"Locked out of my account I love twitter and I‚Äôve had my account for 6 years now, but recently i‚Äôve been locked out of my account. I‚Äôve requested a review about my account 4 days ago which required me to send a photo of my ID, and I‚Äôve yet to get an email back. I sent a request twice and I‚Äôm beginning to become really frustrated. I even tried to call Twitter‚Äôs number which told me to press 1 for customer support which then proceeded to tell me that they don‚Äôt offer customer support over the phone. I don‚Äôt understand why you would have the option listed if you don‚Äôt offer it? I‚Äôve also tried to message Twitter support off a friend‚Äôs account, but it said the DM‚Äôs were unavailable. I had given up trying to salvage my old account, so I decided to make a new one with a brand new email address and I WAS LOCKED OUT OF IT for ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù. I am extremely aggravated because I can‚Äôt even contact anyone to help sort out my problems or make a new account. Like I said, I love Twitter but they need SERIOUS improvement with their customer support. I want my account back!!!"
21,Andielovee,"April 14, 2019",5,"SUGGESTION: I would REALLY like a feature that allows you to block your friends from viewing your posts, but still allows you to view THEIR posts. I want this feature because often times, people who have mental health issues, or issues in general, they usually want to express their problems or grievances on some type of platform, but they don‚Äôt always want their friends to know what they‚Äôre going thru (for various reasons). They just want the autonomy to express themselves authentically. While the private feature allows you to keep your posts private, it doesn‚Äôt foster an environment that allows for communication with strangers who might possibly relate or know what you‚Äôre going through, which in turn promotes a community of encouragement and understanding.

22,Snorkle_shank12,"May 27, 2019",1,"Twitter won‚Äôt enforce its TOS on the worst abusers. Love the app and the other users. Except the ones who are grossly violating the TOS and are ignored by the company. Biggest example is trump. They say that because he‚Äôs a public figure they‚Äôll keep up whatever he posts for ‚Äúpublic record...‚Äù and so they allow him (and many other ‚Äúverified‚Äù accounts) to violate the TOS because it makes them money. Trump repeatedly attacks individuals with twitters support and approval. He threatens war with twitters approval. But if a random small account is reported for a violation of the TOS they‚Äôre just deleted. Jack has shown that his company leans far right. Refusing to take down whit supremacist content claiming that they couldn‚Äôt distinguish between that and republicans accounts. A) they can distinguish and they choose not to, and b) if republicans are posting white supremacist content they should still be taken down even if they‚Äôre in the government. "
23,Bas00mi,"June 9, 2019",2,"They won‚Äôt give me my account back. I was tricked (don‚Äôt ask) into changing the date on my twitter account to one that did not meet the minimum age requirements. After sending in two photos of my ID on two different reports, I finally received an email promising the staff would look into my case. Weeks later, after not receiving any types of updates, I emailed replied to the email in order to receive an update on my appeal, only to find out that my case has been closed and that they have stopped looking into my appeal. After that, I created an alternative account in order to tweet at them and private message twitter support to help me in my process. This was incredibly unsuccessful as they will not even offer to provide you with a live customer service representative. I am wildly disappointed that I had to go through this entire process with horrible customer service and still not have my account back. Twitter management, please fix this problem as I know I am not the only one experiencing it."
24,Varis09245,"July 27, 2019",1,"They suspend accounts for no reason Twitter oh twitter. You have the worst people in your company and those people are radical liberals who think they can silence whoever they want by suspending their account. My account recently got suspended for no reason at all. All I did was respond to a African American woman‚Äôs tweet. Mind you that I am also African American. Twitter suspended me because apparently I was being hateful and harassed this person. When obviously I was responding to a situation with a young rapper was charged for a crime and how it‚Äôs terrible that youth are on the wrong path to success when it comes to rapping. But because of the word I used which was n***a a word I often used on the platform before my suspension, but because I used it and it was in response to a African American woman. Twitter‚Äôs most likely algorithm picked my tweet and most likely thought I was being racist. Twitter you need to think about what you‚Äôre doing because you literally just disobeyed the first constitutional right which is free speech. Stop trying to be the good guys and focus on the company and brand. Stop with the obvious social justice warrior nonsense."
25,Patty Angel,"April 13, 2020",2,"Bias Twitter is a left wing bias site. I‚Äôm Independent and see how bad it has gotten. When will or will it ever be a fair platform? I‚Äôm currently on a 3 day limited restriction but have no idea why! I haven‚Äôt broken any Twitter rules! I get those captchas asking if I‚Äôm a bot but I do everything possible not to do repetitive things just for this reason. I put out some interesting tweets that went a little viral by maybe 1,000 and because I got a lot of followers in a day I go to Twitter jail? Really? I already only follow back so many at a time so I don‚Äôt get in trouble but you find a reason anyway and don‚Äôt tell me why! I hope one day someone creates a site that is fair to its users. I‚Äôm never threatening in any way but Twitter likes to restrict me for no good reason! I mostly just tweet what‚Äôs out on another source so why am I in trouble? I‚Äôve seen people threatening on the left but never get in trouble! Hopefully one day someone will come up with a less bias and Constitutional platform. I believe in Free Speech but would never threaten anyone but I see it all the time!"
26,Oddplayer,"January 11, 2020",5,"So far so good All things considered, Twitter is a magnificent phenomenon. The company seems to have gotten much better about its behavior toward its users. We all knew signing on that it has its rules. We agreed to them. In all fairness however, Twitter has also broken its own rules to the detriment of its guests, and has been a bad actor regarding its bias against profiles that may differ from the political opinions of those who work at twitter. That said, working with limitations often forces us in a good way to refine our thoughts more creatively, and subsequently more clearly. What a great thing for us all to have an outlet for our pain, confusion, humor, love of animals, joys... I‚Äôd like to see Milo Yiannopoulous and James Woods be allowed to return, and I‚Äôm sure there are others who were unjustly banned or suspended who we would be better to be back with us. Like I said, all things considered :)"

I try to keep active on all of the accounts, not spam, keeping my head down even at the atrocities around me, from transphobia and homophobia, to pedophiles proudly showing off what they are, harassing people with no consequences!

When you tap on the messages tab there is nothing there and the notification goes away. But if you then close the app, there is now a red bubble notification on the badge. Open the app again to see what it is and once again it says you have a message. And there‚Äôs nothing there!!! For someone with mild clinical OCD this is absolutely maddening.

It was a game changer back then and it still is now. Every social platform has bugs from time to time, ALL of them. That‚Äôs just how technology works. But I‚Äôll say Twitter has the best response time in regards to anything, not limited to fixing bugs in such a quick manner. It‚Äôs also the only social media platform that TRULY allows you free speech. They don‚Äôt take down offensive posts nearly as often as Instagram and Facebook, only if they cross a verrrryyyyy big line.

It‚Äôs a Political Hyper-Echo Chamber that divides both sides even further, and dare I say, they‚Äôve gone so far as to basically begin the censorship that Chinese citizens face on a day to day basis. Why is my tweet defending myself, my views and way of life, any worse than others defending theirs? After they started doing the hard bans for multiple days, I jumped ship for good and I‚Äôll never go back. Twitter is a dying breed, as is most social media now. We now know, you guys just rake in money on ads and etc, while we sit around feeding your networks with content to keep it interesting, FOR FREE!! Where is the option to start monetizing my tweets? Overall, the app is suffering, the service is suffering, and it‚Äôs just not so great. They are VERY celebrity-protectionist, and they‚Äôre making the platform one that‚Äôs actually LESS inclusive for all, instead of more inclusive."

If the powers that be were not so afraid of it it could blossom into the greatest invention since the printing press. I would have given it five stars except I disagree with some of the unfair censorship. However, it far out does the others by trying to resist the forces thrown at it. I watched a Republican chastise Twitter Rep for not allowing CIA involvement to monitor for Russian disinformation. He also chastised them for not controlling the search result because Alex Jones( this before 2016 election) would show up at the top to often. I don‚Äôt watch him but was reminded how Hillary said if elected she would shut him down and Breitbart as they had no right  to exist. I was stunned and so I salute Jack for withstanding the pressure, for debating an independent journalist I admire. "

One day randomly, my account was suspended without an explanation or email notifying me of this. I had to take it upon myself to file a claim for an unknown reason of why it was suspended in the first place. Don't bother filing a claim, as they send a generic response each and every time! They don't give you an actual number so that you can speak to these people directly for this crap! It's frustrating when people post crude things, have spam accounts, etc. but I can't for the life of me figure out why mines was suspended! Therefore, I tried to make another account and they suspended those too. All I wanted to do was reconnect with friends and family and I can't even get a real response from someone. I literally waited months after this happen to just end up getting it suspended again. This used to be my favorite app and now I will be informing others not to use it. If I could, I would give this app a 0 for how they treat their users and the lack of response they provide."

I don‚Äôt care for the forced viewing of the Trends on the right side of the screen, especially since the trends are by no means close to my interests. I have tried to customize my trends, but all I can do is choose a city, with the closest to my location being Denver, which pretty much only shows sports, or I can let the Twitter AI choose what it believes my interest are, which pretty much is only sports. The problem is that I HATE most sports and most of the people I follow have nothing to do with sports. If there was a way to turn off the trends completely or have the option to actually select the trends I am interested in, I may give the app a higher rating, but until then it stays at 2. (And yes, I have gone in to my Twitter data and updated my interests, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything and when I go back in a week later, the AI has added items back that I have removed.)"

I just use it for laughs because other than that it‚Äôs absolutely unreliable. Sometimes, I find interesting information or informative news, but mostly it‚Äôs fake news and outrage.   Every now and then the application can help me to get current events before anyone else however it is very subjective; you have to know how to efficiently and effectively employ discernment, AND you‚Äôll need your since of humor.  I guess a very high percentage of the user base is solely interested in the goings on of Celebrities, so that‚Äôs usually what you find trending, you have to really search and sift through the garbage to find anything useful.

They keep pushing updates to make it less user friendly, don‚Äôt actually follow through with banning people who abuse their terms of service (unless they‚Äôre a small account) and most of all, removing necessary APIs for third party apps to be able to work. I used third party apps for years because of the way Twitter handles their own native apps. They push ads on you (with no way to remove them. I‚Äôd pay a subscription fee for that), they track everything you do (albeit, not as bad as Facebook) and honestly, I think the most annoying issue of all of them, is the fact that THE IPAD APP IS JUST A BLOWN UP VERSION OF THE IPHONE APP!

Opinions on this app can sometimes be misconstrued as fact, so when operating this app, be sure to have your facts together.

They want nothing less than the destruction of order itself, and to make their point clear, they shuffle the posts *while you are reading them*.

I know I can unfreeze it by moving the little dial at the bottom to skip through the video but i shouldn‚Äôt have to do that. Also i‚Äôve had sound glitches where if you try to skip ahead or rewatch a video once it reaches the end the sound won‚Äôt play and i just move the little bar at the bottom to skip through the video left and right until the sound comes back.

48,Manojee,"June 20, 2019",3,"Nice app but could be way better I like Twitter for the people on the platform and as a source for curated content. .The app, while functional, is confusing. A lot of this boils down to the UX.  The ux elements are crammed together - perhaps to show more rows of content. The end result is it‚Äôs not clear where to tap to do actions vs view them. For e.g, It‚Äôs not clear where to tap to view replies vs enter a reply.  Same with Likes.  Fb does a much better job of this by having separation in the ux for these two.  Finally, with posts with links - why not show a preview? Right now I don‚Äôt know what the link contains or if it send me to some malicious site.  Finally it‚Äôs not clear how to view topics by interests. Also for advanced features like moments, and lists - I have no idea what they are for and how to use them - make it clear. Getting these basics right will go a long way in making the site more useful for non power users."

54,SentraPilot,"June 21, 2019",5,Review There is nothing else quite like Twitter. It‚Äôs really fun to be on Twitter. I just hope the censorship will be confined and limited. Freedom of speech is one of our basic rights and some administrative employees of Twitter are too quick to censure people for speaking freely. That could cause a major lawsuit and could ruin twitter. I hope that the management at twitter will be smart enough to control their employees and prevent illegal censoring and allow all people to speak freely on twitter  because that‚Äôs one of the best things about twitter. There is no place else where ordinary citizens can tweet with high ranking government officials and say what we think about things. Twitter is the only way we can do this therefore I certainly hope that Twitter management will reign in some of their overzealous employees and allow total freedom of speech on Twitter.
55,examinnull22,"April 20, 2020",1,I get no choice?!? This was a good app that I used to use a lot. I lost my account so I had to make a new one but Twitter changed it to where I have to put in my phone number. I am personally not comfortable giving my phone number to an app but for some people who don‚Äôt have a phone number or use a phone number app like text free (which is unsupported by twitter) can‚Äôt even use the app. I think Twitter should make it where you have a choice whether you want to use email/phone number/ or both not make me have to do both. If you were to change this my rating would change. But the fact that I can‚Äôt even use it just cause I don‚Äôt want to give my phone number makes this a 1 star app. If you look in comparison Snapchat and Instagram are better than twitter because more people are able to access it not just people willing to give out there number. Now with what I said in mind if there is a way to skip putting your number in than I will apologize but as far as I can see there isn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve never had this problem with the app until one week ago. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating as once the app crashes, it kinda ‚Äúresets‚Äù everything. Also, when I go to search for old tweets of my account (which is private) or my friends‚Äô account (that are on private) using specific keywords, either the most recent tweet appears or no tweets appear at all.

It‚Äôs really a shame because it used to be a much more open, fun platform to have civil debates with people‚Äîincluding parody accounts where people would have a fun laugh at themselves when they fall for a parody of a famous person. As a society we have become way too serious we have moved away from jokes and lighthearted fun and exchanged it for constant worry about everything that everyone says. People don‚Äôt have senses of humor any longer and it‚Äôs really sad. People have even sued the president of United States because they were blocked by him. With a ruling like that where the blocked people needed to be unblocked, you would think that Twitter shouldn‚Äôt suspend anyone from their platform... but they have. I am positive that Twitter has lost millions of users...because you‚Äôve lost me and everyone else that I know that was on here before. I sincerely hope this platform dies an agonizing death."

As a conservative Im worried about liberals at twitter trying to slant the narrative by censoring conservative speakers and puttin algorithms on them to silence their free speech or shove them to the bottom of the list where they are unlikely to be seen. I see a lot of nasty tweets that should not be allowed esp. under president Trumps twitter account,people using vile gestures or the f-word.

Go back to one week ago, please, to version 7.7 or 7.8. Seriously, the last bad update we had, I used to go back to version 6.31.5 (courtesy of downloading it from my Mac), and it was a huge improvement in functionality, despite the giant step backward. It was worth it. Now I can‚Äôt even do that anymore, thanks to the bloody update on my Mac! Also, scrolling back to the top of a thread is a hugely bad idea.

The simplicity of twitter continues to be its golden fountain that keeps users on their phones, not necessarily contributing to any particular topic, but looking on for comedic content or anything else that may catch their eye (most of the time it's comedic). Twitter is unique in the way users may use the app to release stress by using its interactive features to cope with anything they may be dealing with.

There are a lot of people on twitter who need to be suspended but never do. There is a group of people who will just gang up on you. It‚Äôs 100% a breeding ground for bullying. If you send a report they will not do a single thing about it. But will suspend for the most random thing. It‚Äôs absolutely odd and basically if you aren‚Äôt a part of the good boys club there‚Äôs not point on being on twitter. A few times I have gotten into a fight with an ultra conservative group and I got locked out while they were priding themselves on getting me suspended. And when I brought it up to customer service they did nothing about the men and I kept on getting locked out. Nothing I said violated their terms besides arguing with a man. When I was able to log back in I deleted my account and have been happier since. Just hope this company goes under because they are useless pieces of crap.

I cannot stand the platform throttling me as I watch bot after bot trash up Twitter. They can keep posting but I gotta wait to report them? This is built to fail.

If you don‚Äôt check in on your account it will be automatically set back to the awful algorithmic timeline that displays tweets out of order.

The Twitter staff need to be fair need to be balanced I need to allow both sides to speak freely to have an open forum to have a truly a truly responsible social network to weigh all things and then the let the people make their own decision for themselves for what they decide this is what it‚Äôs all about and ending I can only hope that all can learn and grow together and stop the divide of this country and its people is enough said.

Please stop IMPLYING (via these annoying little floating heart icons) that my accidental tapping of my iPhone‚Äôs ridiculously large screen is in any way a positive endorsement of whatever video is currently being played on my phone from within the app. Because, odds are I tapped some news video that appeared relevant to the day‚Äôs news and my dog jumped up onto the couch, surprising me with a newfound incessant and unrelenting need to have her favorite toy thrown across the room for her so that she can once again feel like the adorable toy fetching hero she is!!"

Better still, now swiping to the right brings out the lists I‚Äôve made but previously never thought of checking because they were buried in the menu!

There are some counterintuitive elements to the way comments and reply‚Äôs work. One can get lost in the sub comments without an easy way of navigating back to any one in particular. I do wish Twitter was a little less about being PC and canceling offensive accounts as it‚Äôs not a family friendly environment in the first place so why even go there at all with reporting? Most of the trending ads lean politically left from what I have seen in the trending notifications I do t think the feature is really useful anyway. Other than that this app has been very fun for me to keep up on the latest/power outages/and my favorite video game content. Keep it up!

Twitter asked me to add my birthday back in June and as soon as I did you locked me out of my account. I have consistently sent verification that I am now 17 years old. The last time I sent verification, you guys asked me not to send anymore complaints which led me to believe that it was getting fixed. 3 week later and I‚Äôm still locked out of my account.

And, there's times on and off when I go to play a video and it pauses after one second and I can't get it to play, no matter if I close the app and try again (but it plays in the small display when I'm scrolling through my timeline?). At first i was convinced it was my wifi, because it started to send things when I would turn it off to be on my data; but then it started to glitch after about 5-10 minutes of using my data so I would have to switch back to my wifi and repeat the process all over again. I just got a notification about my data usage which shows you how much I'm on twitter, and I don't want to keep going through this.... but for now I guess I have to stay off twitter as much as I can."

It‚Äôs been over 7 months now and they still have not unlocked my account or updated me on if/when it will ever be unlocked. The only way to contact support is by DM-ing the ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù account (which is completely automated and also completely useless). I‚Äôm not the only one either; their mentions are FULL of users who were unfairly locked out of their accounts MONTHS ago and have gotten no response. Yet Twitter has been quick to reactivate accounts run by ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù (and still allows literal nazis to have accounts). This used to be my favorite social media site and now it‚Äôs completely useless to me. I lost 10 years of photos and other content that I don‚Äôt have saved anywhere else. Thanks for nothing Twitter!

At first some where sharing information that surely was considered by most as clearly something that should never have posted.

Used by some to show the world something small and insignificant such there lunch or to comment on the weather. And then it became something no one expected and that was a voice. A voice of the oppressed and a voice for the depressed but best of all it not only carried the whispers of reform but became a loud speaker for change. From Black Lives Matter to Times up.

Now my TL shows tweets liked by people I follow in addition to everything else. It takes up more space on my TL. Also, someone who follows me can now turn off retweets. That means that if I retweet something, there‚Äôs no guarantee of my followers seeing it as they did before. I miss the distinction between likes and retweets which is going away now.

For many months I had hundreds of followers that never were accounted for. Why? It seems someone is doing this on purpose. I don‚Äôt argue with anyone, I have many friends. We should be able to communicate and their numbers should show when they follow. I‚Äôve heard the same complaints from several others. Why? Are you going to correct this or continue with unwarranted censorship? "

First, why can't I edit my tweets after I've posted them?? Sure, covfefe will forever live in infamy, but come on!! Second is my frustration with not saving. When I get on Twitter, I'm looking for a quick fix. 5ish minutes of scrolling through my feed then back to work. If I see an article that I want to read and I don't have the time right now, there's literally no way for me to return to it. Half the time I can't remember who posts the story in the first place.

251,Aaron CB,"February 10, 2018",1,"Fake accounts I use Twitter everyday and find it a valuable tool to catch up with current events. Although every time I see a trending topic there are obvious fake accounts trying to sway opinions. There are many politically motivated accounts that just spread propaganda. It‚Äôs gotten unbearable. It‚Äôs time that Twitter takes the initiative to not allow this to continue. Also, it may appear that ‚Äúfamous‚Äù people have millions of followers the fact is a large portion of those followers are not real accounts. When there is a large scale trending topic, with mostly bogus accounts spreading deception, it‚Äôs time to take action against it. Contact me if you need me to show you what I‚Äôm talking about. I see it all the time and I‚Äôm not sure there is a way to report it. It‚Äôs obvious and apparent the most pressing issue facing Twitter. Please do something about it."

Well I started using the other account again, and i noticed that my search function is all messed up. It only shows me results from people i know. If i try to search people specifically, it always says no results found but then i can go to the other account with the same search and it brings up tons of suggestions and everything. The most frustrating part, is i get NOTHING from twitter support. I try calling and they say there is no supper over the phone. I‚Äôve tried the DM feature and it says it‚Äôs unavailable. Nothing is working. Please fix this. I don‚Äôt know why one account would be perfectly fine and one not."

All they responded with was that i broke a rule. Ok cool, tried asking for what tweet or what i said that would‚Äôve made that happen, they refused to tell me. There is NO way of contacting them directly besides dming them on twitter. It‚Äôs kind of impossible to DM someone on twitter when your account is suspended. I‚Äôve emailed them multiple times and they have yet to respond. I love twitter a lot, but this is just ridiculous. i tried making a new account solely just to ask them what was going on, the second i made it, it got suspended. They have no reps to talk to, and they have no reason for deleting my account. i‚Äôm very upset and won‚Äôt stop trying until i get an answer. Honestly, save your time and don‚Äôt download lol."

Though not perfect, on balance, it is a tool that users find convenient and informative. Without regard to political or ideological bent, Twitter is perhaps the most popular social and professional outlet in the cyber world today. To maintain that capability for all, users have a responsibility to self-police and respect everyone‚Äôs right to post, and refrain from direct threats and intimidation. I appreciate this platform, and it‚Äôs commitment to be fair and balanced."

Too many examples of verbal violence promotion by liberals and politicians that face no reprise from Twitter.  The distorted liberal diatribe is what inflamed and divides and then you eventually have conservatives challenging their ridiculous lies that are posted every minute.  The lies are based on lies and conservative voices can only try to address.  Democrats have been the narrow minded ones working to take Rights of others away since the days they ran the Klu Klux Klan and now they are trying to reduce our 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendment Rights on an ongoing basis.   Why is this smart?  Once they are gone we become Khmer Rouge, China, Cuba, Venezuela, and Russia.  Our current rights and freedoms are what make us the envy of the world. Ask all of those who want to come here from other countries. They know."

If they would block people who have admitted to sexual abuse, i.e., drump trump I would love the app even more.  Just because you hold a high office does not, or should not give you a free pass to expressing yourself where children, our most precious resource, are exposed to you.

Twitter has decided they are able to make Freedom of Speech decisions for ALL AMERICANS. Now their leftist bias has been exposed and instead of doing a deep reflection of American values, they chose instead to becoming extreme Leftists. Very much following the extreme behavior.. cutting off followers in the thousands, censoring some and not others who have said MUCH WORSE but not because their view is supported by Twitter, and deleting accounts altogether such as Diamond and Silk for NO REAL READON. Twitter is no longer a fun dynamic way of being involved, now it is a fighting to the finish platform where Americans will continue to push a socialist media outlet to GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND SUPPORT ALL EXCEPT DIRECT THREATS TO LIFE, PORN, AND RACISTS NAME CALLING OR LABELING THAT INCLUDES THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT BASIS OR FACTUAL INFORMATION!!"

Come on people that is nasty and poor kitchen habits. Martha Stewart and Emeril Lagasse are good hosts overall. Someone needs to make them aware of what they are doing. Using a spoon and double dipping into the food. Touching the food with their fingers that they have licked. Germs are spread from hand to their mouth.

People are mean spirited and hide behind a limited number of words in order to bash - most especially politicians. I find Twitter limiting access to many more conservative postings while liberal information is easily accessed. Freedoms of speech is one thing, but hiding behind a computer screen to purposefully bash and mislead others is wrong. If you report a stream of name calling, adolescent bantering or plain vulgar references, it‚Äôs ignored. In my own ignorance I have come back 3 times, only to leave once again because I find myself angry, upset or even depressed at the divisiveness of America. Twitter is a mirror of our society. Argumentative, others are always wrong, name calling and cruel close mindedness is what this about. Bet this won‚Äôt even be posted."

In addition to the jumbled mess it is, I have consistently tapped the button while scrolling though my feed, which is an enormous inconvenience. I really wish there was a way for me to go back to before I updated it. Honestly debating deleting the app because it gives me so much anxiety having a jumbled screen.

A recent update removed this feature and now all the Media tab is just another feed of individual posts, text content and all, you have to scroll through individually.

It provides a great way to communicate with friends and colleagues along with receive up to date information on news and sports. Tweeting is an extremely entertaining past time and gives the user an opportunity to collaborate and communicate to similar minded individuals in a fast and efficient manner. I would recommend Twitter to anyone who is looking to expand their presence online. Furthermore, Twitter is an essential part of the modern social media experience. 5 out of 5!"

Twitter has started to see its parallels with the modern easily offended society and I think that the app should interfere less with the simple jokes because that ruins the applications sense of open communication with one another. But as a whole Twitter is an app that allows people to find not only their voices but those of others whom they agree and disagree."

516,Kellztheraptor,"August 19, 2019",1,"Not a safe app for young people Twitter has little to no way of fighting back against online harassment, cyber-bullying, and curating a timeline of things you want to see. Twitter changes how things show up on your feed so often that it‚Äôs extremely difficult to filter put things that are violent or inappropriate. There are only limited ways of filtering content and it all must be done manually, one tweet at a time. Twitter also collects your interaction data and uses it to send you ads. Tons of them. It is not a safe place for minors and is a hub of communication for radicalized political groups. I would not recommend this app. Parents should be especially careful allowing children access to twitter as well."

I don‚Äôt have a K of followers because I keep using Twitter in the simplest way and it is because I don't use it to influence anybody. I avoid being offended or manipulated by someone‚Äôs point of view.  I like being able to pick my short readings and follow imparcial reflections. One good tool is blocking and reporting aggressive twits. That last one is perhaps the best way to teach and have a consequence for bad actions. I have seen results when I report those twits and hope these accounts learn a lesson.

STOP censoring conservatives and allowing liberals to attack them on this app while the conservative accounts are often removed/banned for zero actual reason and lose followers due to an automated system that discriminates against anyone with a brain."

Because of my views in my political beliefs. Sometimes I feel like I am being censored because I have a lot of followers but yet I have no likes or retweet. Which I find really funny and really fishy. So it leads me to believe that I am being censored. And I think Twitter is being unfair to a lot of conservative views.

Have heard of twitter interfering with the free speech of some some groups, integrity of free speech for everyone should always be the case in regards to communication.

I have no problem with this as it makes sense that those who provide a service should be able to make a profit. The problem is that Twitter is run by people who can not stop their personal ideologies and beliefs from influencing their decisions. They ban people with views they do not agree with. See joe organ and Tim pools podcast with Twitter. They are the opposite of freedom of speech. Twitter will bend the knee to whoever can cause them damage. They are spineless.

Small recommendation about Poll feature, instead of ‚Äúonly voting once‚Äù‚Äî because there‚Äôs people who might‚Äôve accidentally voted on something else and it bothers some of us‚Äî you should let us change our vote (making it the last voting chance) if that makes sense.

I always wind up seeing the exact same people every day. I have to seek out a lot of others instead of just letting me see most recent Tweets. This platform seems very interested in me knowing what certain folks tweet while ignoring the vast majority of the folks I follow.

If you‚Äôre rich or famous or powerful, Twitter will allow you to say and do whatever you want. If you‚Äôre just an Average Joe, you could be punished merely for making a harmless joke.

This may or may not be an issue for iPads that are bigger the 10.5 screen but the new redesign is way to clutter. This new design to be honest seems to be a downgrade in terms of aesthetics (no offense to the design team).

Twitter could go down in history as the media platform that unified Americans but you need to give those with Conservative viewpoints just as much exposure as you do liberal viewpoints.  Your shadowbanning is driving away great conversations.  Freedom of speech - no matter how hurtful, is essential in this unification.  It‚Äôs your choice.  Choose wisely."

Twitter will shadowban conservative voices, meaning your tweets will be posted, but no one will read them, because they won‚Äôt be able to see them.

If u use this app to get your news, u are a fool and a Neanderthal. But if you like jokes/entertainment/internet stuff, this is definitely #2 to reddit!

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this platform to anyone anymore . Straight TRASH wish I could give 0 stars

I opted out of most, but when I visited the page again, most interests were rechecked. This is super frustrating. Thankfully, I never updated my twitter app on an old phone, so when I‚Äôm home, I tweet from there. Please restore the topics page. (I hade to give one star to submit this review.

Lots of ppl haven‚Äôt gone on their accounts in months and the ones left are hateful and self absorbed....and nothing is against Twitter policies. In a week I was singled out and attacked by an African American woman because I was a white woman, called ‚ÄúYOU People‚Äù for being a legal immigrant and saw nothing but hate mongering and misinformation from celebrities I once admired. Stay away from this self absorbed, toxic breeding garbage!!!! Life is too short!"

I seem to be able to follow Trump‚Äôs rants, and I‚Äôve replied to some, but I‚Äôm never sure that they‚Äôve made it. I‚Äôve made some replies that actually appear above his Treet. On other occasions, others have replied to his Tweet, and if I reply, I seem to be replying to both him and the others who‚Äôve replied. Twitter is an interesting, though confusing means of communication. So many people are using that I surely just have yet to get the hang of it."

Just every time I try to log on they want me to delete my pure veritas. I will not!

First, your app is littered with porn so no idea how Apple allows your app to be in the appstore when a magazine like playboy has to censor its magazines and remove any nudity.

It is obviously a policy meant to silence the GOP and President Trump going back to Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs despicable act of tearing up the SOTU speach. New twitter majority shareholder cannot take over fast enough and clean out all you clowns and return free speach to your platform. Until then we‚Äôll just put up with your bias and total b.s."
