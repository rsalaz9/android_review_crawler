2,B&WR,"August 30, 2017",5,"Great App... This App is extremely convenient, if you know you need your food ready by the time you reach the restaurant this is the App for you.."

6,Dsb425,"December 6, 2016",5,Super easy to use Easy to use for my favorite lunch spot that gets busy. Saves waiting in line and ordering was clear and simple.
7,JorelJorel,"December 6, 2016",5,Great for office workers! I hate waiting for my food at a restaurant during my lunch break and this is a great way to save money and time. Highly recommended!!
8,psos20,"December 8, 2016",2,"Bait & Switch I thought the purpose of the app was to get a discount on food, they set up your usual order and make it really easy to one click purchase. Next thing you know the discount is gone and you're stuck paying a service fee. "
9,poscha,"December 5, 2016",1,App doesn't work It's stuck on the purple page searching for locations. The wheel goes round and round. Quit the app and loaded again. Same issue. It's frustrating to download apps I get excited about only to see they can't get users past the first few screens. Waiting for update.
