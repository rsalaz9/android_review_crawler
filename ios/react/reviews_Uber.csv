0,Jbarkley13,"September 23, 2019",3,"App is good, but could be improved The biggest problem I have with the app is that when you open it, it does not default to your current location. It defaults to your last location where you placed an order. This makes it easy to make the mistake of placing an order for food that may not even be in the same city as you. Not a big deal, if the cancellation policy wouldn’t allow the restaurant to charge you full price for an order that you know you will not be able to receive, irregardless of how fast you realize your mistake and cancel the order. I cancelled an order IMMEDIATELY as it was placed because I noticed my mistake as the app was placing the order. It charged me full price for my order even though I cancelled within 2 seconds of the order being confirmed. When I called customer service, they were able to see that from the time I placed the order until it was officially cancelled was 12 seconds. They said the restaurant was already preparing my food. Give me a break...They ended up giving me a refund as a “one time courtesy”, but I was told they would never extend that courtesy again. Simply ridiculous. The app should always default to your current location, or at least verify your address is correct when placing the order. I realize the mistake was my own, but why am I seeing menus from restaurants in another state when I open the app??? Please fix this...."
1,mindysuec,"December 20, 2019",1,"Horrible Customer Service and terrible app If you are hungry, DO NOT USE this app. I have had problems in one form or another with every single one of my orders. Most recently, I placed an order for a nearby restaurant while I was at work and unable to leave. After waiting for the order to be completed and picked up, I received a call that one of the items was not available. Instead of canceling that item they cancelled the entire order and when I went to the help section to contact customer service, I was shown a standard message with no one to reach out to. I then re placed the order and had to wait for a new delivery driver to drive across town, wait for the order to finish being prepared and then delivered. 2 hours later I received my order with no apology or credit. In addition, I was not able to order the ingredients that I wanted because there are no comments section and they did not have all items that are in stock listed. My order was from Subway which is only a block away, next time I will just order Jimmy Johns directly so I at least know that I will get me food and not have to wait around for hours."
2,b.phli,"August 12, 2019",4,"Not always Uber’s fault I understand the frustration with ordering & waiting for food and then there’s something missing! However, most of the time, missing items are not the Uber driver’s fault. The driver’s app is limited in what is displayed regarding the customer’s order and sometimes drinks do not even show up. The restaurant workers, who have full access to the order details, will often prepare the order and seal it or tie it up by the time the driver comes to pick it up and we’re basically going on their word that the order is complete. And over time we learn to ask if there are any drinks with the order because the driver’s app often leaves them off and the restaurant workers might forget. Sometimes there is a long wait at the restaurant to pick up the order because the customer’s food is not ready and some drivers might cancel due to excessive wait times because they are losing money while waiting 20 minutes for a customer’s order to be prepared (and that is a very patient driver!). I cannot speak on the technological issues on the customer’s end, but drivers have their own share. However, I can say that Uber is constantly making updates and improvements on the drivers’ end. As with anything, there will be issues, but overall, Uber is doing a great job at resolving the ongoing problems with the app."
3,never mind my namr,"December 10, 2019",1,so many bugs and frustrations it’s not worth it I used to use it all the time but getting on it again it was SO FRUSTRATED.
4,DatBadBosLady,"April 18, 2020",1,"Too Much Of A Headache So hear I am really craving for some Chipotle, in a lazy mood didn’t feel like driving so I said let me try Uber eats for the first time. My sister downloaded on her phone for me since I was gaming (didn’t wanna die) and I gave her my card information to pay. She put in the order but in the end it said we couldn’t process your payment try again. I thought what?? There’s enough in the account. So I said maybe she put in the numbers wrong so I took over and did the numbers again, it said this card is already saved to the profile so I said screw it lets go through PayPal. I put in my password confirmed everything PayPal wanted me to and tried to process it again...still wouldn’t go through. By then I said let me try on my phone. First it told me that They don’t deliver in my area so I refreshed everything made a new account and still ran into the same problem with the payment not processing I begin to get a frustrated, knowing everything was okay with my card after doubled checking several times I then tried to do it from my desktop still same thing. By then I said screw it let me try Door Dash thinking maybe its just me maybe Im doing something wrong. So I downloaded DoorDash and put it the order in FIVE minutes everything went through with no problem and the food came quicker than what it said. This whole thing took me about an hour trying to do until I gave up. And unfortunately this experience has cause me to revert to DoorDash."
5,ch.steph,"August 1, 2019",1,"Terrible App The Uber app is not bad so I did not expect anything less from UberEats. I cannot speak for the UberEats service in other locations but in I’ve had the worst experience in Philly. I wanted to give the app a try because they offered me a $20 credit for inviting a friend. Besides the fact that I still had to cover another $20 for a discounted $10 meal ($30 - $20 credit) my food took almost an hour and a half to arrive. Time stated 45 - 55 mins, and at the hour mark the time estimated was extended twice. A few friends had the same situation happen. I’ve had Ubers rises that drove me from my house into center city faster with traffic than how long it took food deliveries from a restaurant 5 mins from my house to get to me. "
6,Real Person Like You,"August 7, 2019",1,"MUST READ TO SAVE MONEY!!!!!! Would not recommend unless deliver options were limited , Uber is super fast to take your money and super slow to refund ."

8,IDK Jonny,"August 12, 2018",1,"Tried to fixed my own problem, but instead got punished for it - thieves. So I used to use Postmates and Door Dash until I noticed how they didn’t care for customer service, and if anything happened with you’re experience with them then you’re SOL. I used UberEats and I do love how if the restaurant makes a mistake they’re willing to help you out, but I had the worst experience just because I made a mistake and tried to fix the issue myself. If I would’ve been able to cancel my order within the 5 seconds that I placed it, the the restaurant would have never made it and I could’ve re-ordered; however, I like several others have had to deal with waiting on the line just to get horrendous customer service from representatives that transfer you without consent and have to explain to the next unhelpful person. I’ve never had to deal with something like this and feel like I shouldn’t have to especially if I tried to fix my own mistake without needing my money back. If your company is going to allow this type of behavior and service over a petty few dollars, then I’m willing to scoop down to your level and actually dispute the charges and be done with your app because when someone doesn’t give you your money you cancel their accounts so I heard. And to anyone reading this don’t make the same mistake I did, make sure that you are 100% certain that’s what you want, or else you’ll go through the same ordeal as I did trying to get it resolved."
9,Slot addict 2013,"March 11, 2018",1,"Horrible customer service I’m deleting this app and never using this service again. I was adding items into my cart when plans changed and I decided to meet friends elsewhere. As I started deleting the carted items, I must’ve hit “Complete Order”, as that’s what happened. This app is set up so that one cannot cancel an order. Oh yes...there’s a way to stop delivery of the food....but you’re still paying for it. You have to go to the help screen, select cancel order, then be told to go to the receipts icon on the app main page, tap it, select cancel order, be shown a cookie that states that once a restaurant has “accepted” the order, canceling is impossible. Then you can choose to either keep the order, or call a number, which places you on hold for 5 minutes, after which you are connected to a less-than-helpful person who, after listening to your complaint informs you that since the order has been accepted and being prepared, there’s “nothing we can do”. This is totally unacceptable to me, and I hope it is to the rest of you, so here is how you ACTUALLY get you’re charge reversed:"
