0,WHaynie,"February 15, 2020",1,"Forcing ‚ÄúContinue in Watch‚Äù is a very bad move My two stars from the other week in regards to my saved items automatically being saved to a folder when they aren‚Äôt supposed to is now down to one star due to the newest excuse for an update. In the past I would be watching something and if I clicked on it to watch it bigger it would then show other suggested videos from Watch under it. That was fine. But now I will only be a few seconds into a video on my feed without touching it yet and it will COMPLETELY STOP the video and te me to continue watching  it on Watch. HOWEVER when I try to click the video to make it bigger and thus open it in Watch it won‚Äôt do jack squat. This tells me I would have to click over to Watch and then attempt to refind the video just to bloody watch it in the first place. I don‚Äôt know who was smoking the stupid juice this time, but I would rather watch no videos than have to go out of my way to hunt a video down just to watch after it‚Äôs already been presented in front of me. And as someone with a business page that posts videos (AND PAYS GOOD MONEY to use some as ads) it makes me want to cut back what I spend with you all if this is what my users will be left with. Please please PLEASE change it back."
1,WinstonFl,"September 17, 2019",2,"Buggiest app on my iPad Let‚Äôs face it, if you use social media Facebook is a must have to stay connected.  However the Facebook app is a complete bug filled app that only seems to break more with every update.  I‚Äôve been waiting for years for it to work right and yet I always know when an update comes, because something you use regularly will break guaranteed.  If by some miracle it gets fixed in the bi-weekly update, I promise you something else you use will be hindered in the next version. "
2,MKaip,"November 19, 2017",1,"Locked Out of Account If I could give 0 Stars, I would.. Facebook has locked me out of my account for days, saying they need to review a photo of me. There is no one to contact or email to fix it. I have had my account since about 2005 so it doesn‚Äôt make sense.. The Help Page is of no help because it consists of regular people who do not have access to unlock accounts. Facebook needs to have a direct contact via Chat or email to assist their customers."
3,Pu Erh Tea,"April 19, 2020",2,"Attn: FB suspended my account for no solid reason suddenly Greetings Facebook crew! The purpose I write to you is none other than to impart my report as well as to acquire assistance pertaining to Facebook account service. So today all of a sudden Facebook is asking me to submit a photo ID upon logging in; and I have uploaded and sent a photo of my driving license (genuine!). I have been using Facebook since 2009 if my memory serves me well and I never did infringe your ToU or regulations but somehow you team got me as using a fake profile name? I believe someone from within my friend list or a page (I don‚Äôt know as I followed/Liked tons of pages) was behaving mischievously and made a false accusation or report over my profile for no solid reason. What‚Äôs more, I did not do anything wrong ever since I use Facebook, or use the service for illegal purposes. Pretty please review my account suspension that does not hold water and reinstate it in next to no time. Please reach out to me please. It is the quarantine period and I need to work from home. Not to mention I have other foreign accounts that I link FB to login with. Thank you for your concern. Why do I have to bear a fault that is not mine?"
4,Mzkishanicole,"November 14, 2019",2,"Ok app, people you may know feature is annoying The app is ok to deal with but the people you may know feature is completely annoying and frustrating. I must say it‚Äôs a nice feature but it gets frustrating when you remove people and the next day or a few days later they show up again as people you may know. Facebook needs to add a delete button for that and not just the remove button or the remove button should remove that person and their profile permanently because hitting the remove button only brings that person profile back up within a day or a few days. I‚Äôm completely irritated with it because if I hit the remove bottom it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt know that person, I don‚Äôt want to know that person, or don‚Äôt want to be friends with that person. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend so much time ‚Äúremoving‚Äù but not permanently removing people from the ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù only for them to pop back up as people I may know 24-48hrs later!! IT‚ÄôS ANNOYING. STOP IT FACEBOOK LET ME PERMANENTLY REMOVE PEOPLE I DON‚ÄôT KNOW AND/OR DON‚ÄôT WANT TO KNOW OR BE BOTHERED WITH WITHOUT HAVING THEM POP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. REVAMP THE ‚ÄúPEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW‚Äù FEATURE SO THAT IT CAN BE BETTER MANAGED BY US!! Thanks üò§üò§"
5,Valensghost,"November 16, 2019",2,"Issues that need fixing There are several things that are frustrating.  1- if I mark See posts first, that means I want to see this persons posts first ‚Äî NOT three days later, and not after seeing countless posts from people not marked See first. See first means see first.  2 - when I scroll through my newsfeed I doesn‚Äôt want it to stop after 3 or 4 posts.  I want it to keep scrolling.  When I‚Äôve seen enough I will quit. If I delete the app it and reinstall, it will work for awhile but will behave the same way again soon.  3-  if I see a post on my Facebook iPad app, I should be able to also see it on my iPhone Facebook app.  Why aren‚Äôt these two newsfeeds consistent? 4 - if I have a custom list or a smart list, why can‚Äôt I click on that list and see posts from just those people?  5- if there are birthdays or events that show up in the right hand column, I don‚Äôt want to see the word DONE, I want to see the event or birthday.  Again, I can get this to work again if I delete and reinstall the app. Perhaps rather than working on enhancements the developers just need to fix the bugs, and then be sure future bug fixes don‚Äôt break things again."
6,Pikaboo09,"February 17, 2019",3,"New update causing newsfeed to freeze Didn‚Äôt have this problem until yesterday when the new update kicked in. Everything else works fine, notifications, clicking through group posts and whatnot. But as soon as I go to news feed before or after doing other things on the app it just freezes. I‚Äôve reset the app, I‚Äôve reset my phone, I‚Äôve cleared all of Facebook‚Äôs caches, and I‚Äôm going to try uninstalling and reinstalling next."
7,shellbell__,"May 1, 2020",1,"Cut the crap Hi Facebook! Right now people are home full time because they cannot go to work. These people (like me) are messaging more, posting more, and friending more. But for some reason if we do that too much (no one actually knowing how too much is you just have some secret number or something) we get banned! I‚Äôve been banned twice and you wanna know what I was doing? Messaging my family group chat ABOUT MY AUNT BET WHO IS DYING!!!! Please either change this or just stop banning people for messaging too much and posting too much! You wanna know what ‚Äúweird activity‚Äù is? When an account is just made and messages so many people at once and friends so many people at once but when you‚Äôve had an account since 2011 I shouldn‚Äôt be flagged!!!! Go look at the new profiles doing this not profiles that‚Äôs been here for 7 years!!! I‚Äôm so tired of my Facebook being shut down while talking to friends and family or when I‚Äôm trying to sell something from market place or Facebook groups it‚Äôs absolutely redundant! If you‚Äôre going to ban people at least go into detail as of why not just ‚Äúderrrr your acting weird on facebook derrrr‚Äù it‚Äôs annoying! Especially when we‚Äôre STUCK AT HOME DUE TO THIS VIRUS! Thanks God Bless"
8,ehmob,"March 17, 2020",2,"WHAT IS GOING ON??? A couple of my posts are being removed as going against Community Standards regarding spam. One was an historical article entitled ‚ÄúCoronasvirus and the Sun: a Lesson from the 1918 Influenza Pandemic‚Äù (I posted one and the other that appears on my timeline I was tagged in) The other post that was removed as spam was regarding digitized artwork from Paris museums entitled ‚ÄúParis Museums Put 100,000 Images Online for Unrestricted Public Use‚Äù. In this case I did post both, the first time was March 4th, the second time was March 16 with a title that suggested a wonderful way to view the art work - by streaming the site. A form of entertainment that is both beautiful and educational. I would not be writing this here except for the fact that there is no longer a place on the app under Help and Support were I could pose questions or defend my posts. I was also unable to find FB‚Äôs definition of spam. Did I miss something or miss an update? I do try to update regularly. Or perhaps the most recent update for my phone, needs to get some more bugs worked out and improvements made. "
9,Daaabby,"November 2, 2019",1,"Terrible app, terrible website I hate Facebook. There's more things than I want to even write out. The security/customer service is pure garbage. Why? Because they don't have customer service! My Instagram (of course Facebook owns Instagram) got hacked and the situation was so complex that there was no way the automated response service could help with it. Come to find out there's no live customer support... Honestly, how is that even legal???? Does it even matter how many accounts there are on Instagram? It's not like Mark Zuckerberg and Co have no money to hire people or something? I don't know maybe I'm just crazy. Because I thought they were pretty rich."
10,Amyncosolo,"October 3, 2017",2,"Shutting down I don't know why but lately Facebook app has been shutting down and going to my main screen while I'm reading somethingüò°very annoying!!! Fix this bug please! It also refreshes on its own. That's really annoying too when you are going through comments and then back out wanting to continue where you were before going to the comments and it decides on its own ""nope you were done scrolling"" üôÑ "
11,Diane Harris,"October 10, 2017",3,"Irritating App The app has been driving me crazy for months now. If I stay on the Facebook page, it only blacks out once or twice per evening. If I want to read something (my cousin's newspaper article, for instance) posted by my friends, the app blacks out every time and if I want to continue on Facebook, I have to open the app all over again and hope I can find my place. I'm almost ready to delete the darn thing!  Wondering if it's worth the frustration! I've written my problems to the staff through Facebook three times and have received no recommendations. Can the app be fixed?"
12,Kristycake,"November 6, 2017",1,"Enough with refreshing the newsfeed! I never write reviews, but these recent updates make me want to delete Facebook. 6 months ago, if I needed to pause my Facebook scrolling go do something else, I would just click someone‚Äôs picture and it would ‚Äúhold my place‚Äù in my newsfeed. This was great. I‚Äôm a mom to a toddler and I oftentimes have to multitask. NOW, if I switch to a different app or put my phone down for 10 SECONDS to do something else, my newsfeed refreshes, and starts at the top. This is infuriating when I‚Äôm in the middle of reading an article or looking at an album of pictures. What is the purpose of this? Who is it benefitting? Certainly not your users. I find myself getting on Facebook less and less these past few weeks because I get more annoyance than enjoyment out of it. Do you not do any kind of market research before you implement these things? And please, get rid of the camera. Everyone and their brother has a camera on their phone. I think we‚Äôre set! I‚Äôm tired of swiping left to exit a post and accidentally hitting the camera which takes 10 seconds to load.  I can‚Äôt imagine what your UI/QA teams get paid to ‚Äúok‚Äù these poorly planned ‚Äúenhancements‚Äù."
13,So Done!,"October 24, 2018",1,"Someone LIED to you Whomever told you this latest update was a great idea, SHOULD BE FIRED. 1)When notifications come in that I‚Äôve been tagged or someone has replied to a comment I made, it no longer takes you to the post, just to the comment. So if I commented last week and I get a reply today I have absolutely no idea what the original post was about. 2) A notification disappears after I look at it. So if I have to refer back to it for any reason, I have to somehow find the page of the original poster and then hunt for the post. STUPID IDEA 3) When going to some notifications, when you click on it it takes you to a blank post. I see the persons name, the time they posted and maybe if someone reacted to it, but absolutely no post at all. There‚Äôs even comments on it but I see no post at all. Yes I have access to  their page, I haven‚Äôt been blocked and they call me to say ‚Äúdid you see my last post‚Äù and all I see is nothing. "
14,Sheryl1468,"November 11, 2018",2,"No notifications about my posts! For the last 2 months, the notification settings in the app are a complete mess.  The app will have the red number, but one of them are about my own posts. Any reactions or comments to MY posts don‚Äôt load in the list of notifications, so I have no idea about comments or reactions unless I actually go to the post itself.  All I see are notifications about my friends‚Äô posts.  Further, while the news feed works fine, the list of notifications is limited to EXACTLY 20 notifications.  When I scroll to the bottom, the page just jumps and doesn‚Äôt refresh to show any more than exactly 20.  Maybe once a week I will scroll and be surprised to be able to scroll past 20, but it‚Äôs not because of anything I did or didn‚Äôt do.  AND once I scroll back to the top of the list and scroll back down, I‚Äôm limited to 20 again.   AND notifications for my posts still aren‚Äôt in the list.  I have a brand new iPhone 6s Plus (3 months), so if Facebook doesn‚Äôt fix it soon, I am going to be convinced that the problems are a way to push people to upgrade their phones to the newest versions."
15,Matti moo,"December 3, 2018",1,"If it isn‚Äôt broken, don‚Äôt fix it Nobody wants a game page or a group page. It‚Äôs amazing how many different ways you want to send me push notifications, that I literally only click on so that it will go away. I went in to change my notification settings and it turns out you will not let me turn off all group notifications at once and I have to go through a list and manually select out of 100 groups which ones I want, the slider for all is greyed out. This is totally unnecessary, and nobody asked for this. Why do I have a notification for every time someone goes live? Anytime an event is added at a venue I checked into ONE TIME that‚Äôs across the world in a different country? Facebook notifications used to notify me when someone wanted to talk to me, and I‚Äôve done my best to continually update my setting but it‚Äôs getting crazy. Now I‚Äôll have 7 notifications and check it and not a single one is about a friend I have that was reaching out to me. Events, game page, so and so went live, so and so checked in safe, I have memories from 10 years ago to look at, so and so posted in this group, like I do. Not. Care. And I don‚Äôt need a red push notification making it seem like I should."
16,The lord is exceptional,"August 4, 2019",1,Following the prompts doesn‚Äôt work at all I have follow all the necessary prompts that i am suppose to take and every since i got my new phone but it won‚Äôt let me get back into the app at all when i have repeatedly taken four selfies on yesterday with me whole up different numbers and i have taken some other selfies with me whole up different other numbers today as well but by me repeatedly doing this i am putting myself at risk repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again and if you are a new user to Facebook don‚Äôt trust it if you get log out and can‚Äôt get back in because you switch mobile companies and you don‚Äôt have your old phone number or old mobile phone and if you more than Facebook post they won‚Äôt take that down neither once putting you at risk for hackers so if you are a new Facebook user don‚Äôt trust it if don‚Äôt be put at risk for haveing more than one Facebook page and post i will not give Facebook any type of ratings for haveing my identity expose in a manner in which i just stated in this paragraph it‚Äôs wrong and will be getting in touching with the Federal Trade commission center since i no way to deactivate all my pages and post.
17,shortcxke,"December 20, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs good. Not perfect, but good enough. Just be smart and don‚Äôt click on random links, don‚Äôt give away your password to anybody, don‚Äôt accept suspicious links even from your friends unless it‚Äôs 100% sure that it‚Äôs your friend who messaged you. There are many cases that people are ‚Äúhacked‚Äù, when in reality they just gave away their password. I‚Äôve been using the Internet since I was in 3rd grade and i‚Äôve never been hacked. I‚Äôm in college now!"
18,Homanomana,"February 8, 2020",2,"Little details make a big difference Here recently videos have started displaying this keep watching button right in the middle of the video. If I‚Äôm just scrolling through my newsfeed and want to watch a video in it‚Äôs entirety then I should be able to do that!! Not only that but then I also have to deal with the ads in the video too! It‚Äôs frustrating and makes the app not very enjoyable to use! Also, the back/forward arrows on a webpage need to be put back where they were at the bottom of the page. It‚Äôs too easy now to hit the X button to close a webpage when all I really wanted to do was go back a page. Very frustrating when you‚Äôve been looking at something for a long time only for it to close and then the newsfeed refreshes and you‚Äôve lost the link you were looking at originally. None of the other apps (Pinterest, Instagram) do this. Their back/forward buttons are at the bottom of the screen, away from the ‚ÄúX‚Äù button so you don‚Äôt risk closing your page. It‚Äôs little thing like this that make or break an app. And right now Facebook, you‚Äôre on the verge of falling apart."
19,Allymations15,"November 30, 2019",2,Seriously? Okay so well I love the app. I get to talk to my family and join groups specifically the ones about animals and anime‚Äôs I like/have. 
20,asmileforjenna,"April 8, 2018",1,"Nothing loads anymore... When I open the app I can only see a handful of posts from days ago. When I scroll to the bottom, the app doesn‚Äôt load any more posts. Refreshing does nothing. I don‚Äôt get any error messages. On the posts that do show up: 1. comments don‚Äôt load at all 2. videos freeze after max 10-15 seconds 3. when I react to or comment on something it never actually posts it; next time I load the app and see the post I commented on, my both my comment & reaction don‚Äôt show up. "
21,cevans172,"August 18, 2018",3,"Nothing loads anymore I‚Äôve been a faithful Facebook user for years. It is my go to social media platform and I love it. However for the last couple months I‚Äôve noticed it won‚Äôt load random things. Images, comments, and video will stop loading if I‚Äôve been scrolling for a minute or two. Sometimes I‚Äôll be just hopping on and comments won‚Äôt load for something. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm on WiFi or data. I‚Äôve even gone as far as to uninstall it and reinstall it twice this week, which worked for that night and stopped the next day. I never used to have this problem until after I got the iPhone X. My husband just switched phones to the iPhone X like me (got mine on Mother‚Äôs Day) and now he experiences it too, and we have friends who say they noticed it as well on this phone but when they switched phones, it was all good. Is there possibly a compatibility flaw between Facebook and the new iPhone? I hate not being able to use it like I used to. Hopefully this can be fixed so we can keep using it."
22,TamaraMonkey,"September 5, 2018",1,"Unwanted sounds. Huge unusable app. I kept hoping Facebook would stop switching in app sounds back on and that they would also do away with trying to force me to create a passcode, but the undoing of my preferences by the app has become relentless. I have to switch off the app sounds daily. It‚Äôs obnoxious! I never wanted them in the first place. How many times will I have to inform the app that I want the sounds shut off for good? It is unpleasant to hear cheesy clicking and clacking sounds as you simply move from post to post on Facebook. Horrible idea."
23,changemessenger,"October 12, 2018",1,"Facebook Messenger Please find a way not to show all your friends when you‚Äôre on FB. I sometimes like to zone out on FB just to pass the night. It is very very annoying to receive pop-ups in the wee small hours of the night from people (most often men) whom I barely know. There are no boundaries on Messenger. What I mean by this is that anyone can Message or even call anyone else whether they are friends or not. I have been harassed and annoyed in this manner also by a man who was drunk and didn‚Äôt want to take no for an answer in the middle of the night, calling on Messenger over and over again. I had to threaten to call police. How did he know I was awake and alone? Messenger!  It can also bring up trust issues with people in relationships who don‚Äôt know if their significant other is live chatting with a side piece or playing FarmVille in the wee small hours of the night. I‚Äôm a private person who likes to keep my business to myself. Find a way, please, to let the user decide whether or not they want to let anyone or no one pop up and interrupt their lives with Messenger. I regularly install and then uninstall, when it could just be so easy to fix it. Please do."
24,Xavier Wolfen,"April 1, 2020",1,"Not worth it, borderline violates freedom of speech They‚Äôre run almost completely by bots it seems and you can be banned from posting for the most ridiculous things. Wasn‚Äôt like this before, but either they‚Äôre under new management or their bots are now hypersensitive. I didn‚Äôt even get told what I did wrong, only that I posted something offensive in one of the many groups I‚Äôm in (I‚Äôm in a group for people to share offensive opinions, so yeah I‚Äôm going to post something there that may be construed that way because that is what that group is for!) and that I‚Äôm blocked from posting until April 1. April 1 came and I tested it out, still blocked until 8:22 the morning they said. It‚Äôs 8:58 now and I‚Äôm still blocked, but no explanation this time. I‚Äôve had posts taken down before that don‚Äôt break any laws or advocate breaking any laws, but are simply funny memes that I share to specific groups so I don‚Äôt offend anyone who is outside of that group and not wanting to see it. Even been banned just for posting my opinions, no threats, no attacking people, just operating my right to freedom of speech!

25,Sarikay1994,"January 17, 2020",1,"Buggy in the app, buggy in the browser, just can‚Äôt win. I use my iPad exclusively for managing a business page on facebook. IT IS INFURIATING. Nothing works properly. The app skips around, comments don‚Äôt post occasionally, and the worst is trying to dig through a whole post to find where someone has tagged me in a comment. For some reason, notifications don‚Äôt bring me to the tag or reply, it just sends me to the general post or group and I have to DIG for it. It‚Äôs a huge waste of my time and a hinderance to my business. Then, in the browser, it inserts double spaces every time I hit the space bar. This is a confirmed Facebook problem, not the fault of Apple, safari, or chrome. It is the same across all browsers. Some have theorized that this is so facebook can force you to use the app, where they have more room for advertising, but THE APP DOESN‚ÄôT WORK EITHER. If I was not dependent on Facebook for my business, I flat out would not use it. It‚Äôs terrible. Terrible platform, terrible apps, terrible algorithm codes. You‚Äôd think a multi million dollar company would at least be competent enough to resolve the double-space issue in the browser. Ridiculous. FIX IT."

27,Tazzie637,"April 3, 2020",1,"Um, what?! I have an idea!! Instead of pretending your app is perfect, how about make a place where people can actually report issues with the programming??

Why am I getting the notification that they are calling when it clearly states they will NOT be able to call?? Fix that.. Also, I loathe that when I pause a video and put my phone down, the video starts playing again.. That makes absolutely no sense at all.. Why have a pause button?? It seems like the ‚Äúupdates‚Äù that happen every two weeks are just adding more minor inconveniences and prohibiting more and more options, like changing your name.. Also, why are people I have on my blocked list placed on the list of people to share posts with?? I went to share a post on a specific persons page and two people I have on my blocked list were on that list of people to share with.. WHAT?! Makes so sense!!

28,yainara,"December 23, 2019",1,"Worst App ever I am literally hating facebook so much! Every update to ‚Äúmake facebook better‚Äù is a scam! Everything gets changed every 2 week and that‚Äôs not to mention such a trashy algorithm. For starters I am being charged $25 on my new page for ads when I have never run an add on this page. However it still telling me my card is not going trough and I‚Äôm just soo confused as to why am I being charged, thankfully I have never put down my card information.

29,Keetgi,"February 3, 2020",2,"Updating the App into Uselessness I am a member of a lot of groups and rely on my email notifications to decide which posts to actually read and which to ignore. Unfortunately, FB made that impossible several months ago when, during an update, my email notifications suddenly became two lines instead of the full post. I‚Äôm assuming that was to force me to visit FB more often. What‚Äôs worse, is that in a recent update, when I click on the ‚Äúview on Facebook‚Äù button in the email notification, instead of taking me directly to the post I want to read, FB now takes me to a random video in the FB watch tab. Presumably to get me to watch more videos. But all it‚Äôs doing is frustrating me to no end. Now, the latest, is when I manually try to find the post I want to read by looking at my notifications tab, the post doesn‚Äôt show up until I refresh the group page, which never used to be the case. It is all a downward spiral that makes me wish I could just stop using FB and try something else. Stop updating the app to make it less convenient for users!"
30,Spotteddog367sweet,"December 12, 2017",1,"Facebook sometimes listens to my cell phone calls A few times I have been talking to friends on my cell phone about a product a friend likes or I like. Minutes later I see ads for the same product. One time a friend said she would like one of those walk in bath tubs because she was afraid of falling. I hung up the phone and checked my Facebook wall only to find an ad for the walk in tubs AND for one of those ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" services. Facebook searches through my private address book and suggests that I might want to ""friend"" people they find. There is so much fake news that shows up on my wall. Some of the ads are so obviously fake and they show up everywhere on FB. Ones about alive celebrities where the ad says so and so died and no one knew she died. Others that say things like Joy Behr is quitting the View because she uses a certain face cream. Our president spends all his waking hours lying to the American public. I don't want to be bombarded with more lies. I wish I could trust Facebook. I like being in touch with friends of my choosing. I don't like being manipulated by Facebook. They are very invasive."

But facebook should provide strong control over the user‚Äôs photo.. so that i wont be downloaded in other devices. Even though some of pic may be screenshot. Facebook should also implement a system like face identifying AI to identify the use of multiple photos of same user over different account.

I keep my friends list very limited to under 20 people tops (mostly family and not even friends & co-workers) so that I can share video and photos with them about life events. I also post news commentary. I know about the NSA thing with Snowden. This is not what has upset me. Now, Facebook is publicly threatening that instead of just the algorithm and a relatively small team of content curators based out of Facebook's HQ, they are planning to hire an army of up to 20,000 human content police! I have real fears that one of these 20,000 strong may end up being a nosy neighbor down the street. I don't like the idea of having 20,000 people capable of seeing my posts that I don't even know who they are. The NSA is in Maryland, Facebook is in California. I was not worried about people from either of those groups being a neighbor living next door to me that I do not want to have access to my information! I am very weird in what I post (ufo stuff).

This has been the most stressful annoying experience ever.  No tech support while developer Mark is a billionaire.   I also several times a week only have about 6 items and the feed ends.  Log out and back in. Did setting for a couple people to be on the top of my feed.  Never are.  My daughter is trying to Like things and gets a ‚Äòthis action is blocked ‚Äò reply and tells it 20 times that it‚Äôs a mistake and then it happens again.  Then it locked her account.   Then you have to identify 5 people who are friends to convince FB that you are still really you.  Then she had to change password two different times in two days and she‚Äôs an expert at this app.  Ruining my vacation trying to post our things and encounter glitch after glitch.  Oh log out AGAIN!!!! Try AGAIN!!   By the volume of all these crappy reviews I would think the boss would want to fix these bugs and actually be an above standard app.   Guess you don‚Äôt care anymore once you get really rich.

That‚Äôs not it! Until it happened to me! I have never purchased or looked up sudifed online or anything like it even Tylenol or anything else online  pain reliever in my life. One day at work I had a headache and asked my coworker for sudifed and and she mentioned the word and then I did that was the only time we ever talked about it and sure enough I check my FB 24 hours later like everyone else within a day or two and as pops up ‚ÄúSudifed extra strength‚Äù very next day remember I have never bought or looked this up I never needed to.

Comments on posts either don‚Äôt appear, or you have to keep clicking ‚Äúmost relevant‚Äù then ‚Äúall posts‚Äù to get them to appear. The flagging algorithm is a total mess. Anyone can be accused of ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù and will be punished for it, even when nothing remotely resembling hate speech was said. Meanwhile, someone can make one racist comment after another, get reported, and nothing happens to them. Pictures showing no nudity or sexual content get flagged for ‚Äúviolating community standards‚Äù while pictures actually containing nudity, are allowed to stay. Typing is becoming nearly impossible. The space button either doesn‚Äôt work, inserts ‚Äú.‚Äù, or completely changes the typed words into gibberish. Using predictive texting results in more gibberish. I could go on and on.

44,Dead Kenny B,"November 30, 2018",1,"Junk App Facebook updates regularly and adds or adjusts features but never seems to fix actual problems. Of course, Facebook is feedback-aversive. A new issue has popped up - when you share a post and select ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù so you can add notes, the predictive text doesn‚Äôt work properly. If you‚Äôre typing and then click on the completed word and hit space afterward, it actually backspaces and erases the last letter of the word that was just put there. If you don‚Äôt catch it and retype the last letter and hit space and start typing the next word, you end up with one long word instead of two. This is is s new glitch that Facebook hasn‚Äôt bothered to fix in its many updates since the glitch started. Also now when I open the app, I have maybe two or three posts and it will not scroll down any further. I guess Mark Zuckerburg is too busy helping Trump and fascism to really give a rat‚Äôs behind about what‚Äôs going on with the app. (You can catch a thirty day ban if you insult a snowflake Republican, but by all means start a white nationalist page that openly promotes sedition because that‚Äôs okay according to Facebook.)"

Facebook has never listened to its members, and never will. This app continues to be the most unreliable, complicated, cluttered mess I‚Äôve ever seen. The news feed shows what Facebook wants you to see, instead of what your friends post, in the order it was posted. There are so many irrelevant advertisements on your timeline and you can‚Äôt even watch any videos without Facebook forcing you to watch another irrelevant commercial they‚Äôve inserted into the video. Also, this is the most invasive app in the App Store. Facebook mines your personal information 24/7.

Facebook is doing absolutely nothing to resolve this issue but tell people to do things they‚Äôve already done, or send them to a link for the marketplace that shuts down the whole app and restarts it.

First off, what happened to being able to start off on most recent, why do I want to see old posts again from days ago. I like to see things in chronological order and I don't want to have to go to settings every time to do so. Second, why does there have to be a timestamp showing the last time in was on Facebook or messenger and why can't I hide the fact that I'm on there now? I don't always want everyone to know when I'm on or the last time I was on. And third, really?..with the ads mid video? What the hell is that about? We should all start writing the companies telling them that they will no longer recieve business unless they ask Facebook to stop advertising in the middle of a freaking video!!! That is just ridiculous! Can't believe what Facebook has turned into when it used to be about socializing, finding old friends and like people posts. It's no longer user friendly, just a cold out of touch app that doesn't care about what the people want anymore."

And it *acts* like it's updating, so if I try to scroll all the way to the bottom (it only goes down about two screens' worth now) it ""glitches"" as though it's adding new notifications and I lose my place and it takes forever to get the notifications hidden and sometimes even then they still take up all the space in the notification list.

We‚Äôre moms, ADULTS. These women are 30 & 40 years old being mean girls just because people have different opinions & different taste. Facebook got back with me & said ‚Äúalthough we are aware there are some bullying content on this page, it does not break our Facebook rules/guidelines‚Äù ...I was furious. Does it take a person(s) to take their life due to bullying before a page is taken down?? I have a 0% bullying tolerance. & believe it should not be allowed AT ALL.

I have been having to constantly turn off notifications for random people. Every day the past several days. If I want notifications set for people, then I will set them! I don‚Äôt want to be notified every time someone I hardly talk to posts something.. I also am not very fond of the new app interface or the fact that I can‚Äôt scroll through my newsfeed to watch videos I come across anymore. I have to press on the video and open it all the way to continue watching the full video, and I have to watch ads all the time now. I honestly skip videos now when I see an ad pop up.

Take the gif icon, it‚Äôs a royal pita being inside the comment box, especially with the touch keyboards - hard to avoid with a finger tip when editing a comment. Come to the end of a line and try to edit it, it‚Äôs hard to avoid hitting the stupid thing. Make it optional! I will never ever use a gif in a comment. Plus I do not want to see them, so let us block gif comments. New bells and whistles are meaningless and continue to make FB the number 1 consumer of battery life.

This past year I‚Äôve had a hard time seeing the posts from pages I love and to see new posts I have to go onto the page. I should be seeing a lot of their posts because I‚Äôm liking commenting and frequenting the page all the time and to top that off I got a top fan badge from a page I posted one comment on and never from the pages I frequent which I don‚Äôt care about or understand the idea of badges but I still just found it funny that it happened. Also on any public post I can see that there is thousands of comments and when I go to the comment section it says most relevant comments are selected and there is none. And there‚Äôs no menu to change it like there is on my friends posts. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating and I find it hard to believe that out of thousands of comments you find none of them relevant.

86,eChangX,"September 5, 2019",2,Facebook on iOS is not very interesting This app is kind of boring. If it‚Äôs too much to develop then just separate everything like you did with the messenger.

Till you find better solutions to every little things that sets off everyone‚Äôs feelings towards the app. I can‚Äôt even go straight to a page that I am following which someone commented on. I can only get the working on a normal browser which takes me straight to the page itself. Which much more convenient for me. But these days it seems I can‚Äôt even unfollow a post that I don‚Äôt want to see its notification. So why not try this.. put some sort of expiry on every post we view unless our name is mentioned in it.

I tried to recreate a new FB account, start over. So I used my real name, and same real ID. And FACEBOOK ******* disabled it!

I really hope Facebook goes out of business soon because I am really fed up with their censorship. Facebook is anti-America, pro-Islam, pro-Socialism, and even pro-rape.

I have no respect for the company today, as they've diluted the user quality and have begun to focus on profit over people. What's the point of having a separate app for messages!?!?

I would be less irritated if they were small sized updates (like 20-40 Mbps), but noooo, every update is over 200 Mbps in size and there's very little to NO difference in the app's already diminished quality.

109,lvPhenexvl,"January 19, 2020",1,"Major Bug But Only For Me For the past two weeks, pretty much since the last update Facebook had, ive been having a major issue but I seem to be the only one with it. I have an iPhone X running iOS 13.3 so nothing on my end needs updated because I‚Äôve tried and everything‚Äôs up to date. I haven‚Äôt downloaded any other software that would mess with my phone either. Here‚Äôs the issue, when I try to open the app, it‚Äôs a blank white screen. So I deleted the app and re downloaded it. I was able to open it and sign but then when I closed it and tried to open it again it did the same white screen background. I‚Äôve also tried restarting my phone and same issue and I‚Äôve also tried to restore my phone from a back up from iTunes and still had the same issue. Usually you update your app every week. I understand about the holidays and all but I‚Äôm being kept out of the loop from my family about their holidays and things going on and it is really frustrating. Please help figure out what‚Äôs going on."
110,JV87main,"October 14, 2017",1,"Still garbage Auto refresh is annoying as hell, doesn‚Äôt seem to have a time set either. Newsfeed isn‚Äôt refreshing for the past couple weeks. I‚Äôm out of posts after roughly 20. Even the explore feed. Isn‚Äôt that the point of it? If I save an article or post, I don‚Äôt want to see it again and again in my feed for the next week. Filters for the feed would be fantastic. I don‚Äôt care that 30 people said happy birthday to someone for a week after their bday. Does anyone actually use stories? "
111,cain.g-seller,"March 10, 2018",2,"Market place !!!! Market place currently not working well for iPhone app. Can't access your own items for sale to see or renew them.... also it's kinda bogus to only allow 2 Posts a day! Should be at least 5 posts a day..... also needs a better reporting system, allowing people to report perfectly legit items that meet the standards just cuz they don't like you personally is you allowing fb members to be harassed, you don't even review the items for weeks and thats if you review them at all! How does someone get flagged for selling a curling iron or video game system?!?! It's garbage. Constantly getting restricted or flagged for perfectly good items that meet the standards is harassment!!!! Also sellers should have a place to go that perfectly states what is and isn't allowed, what posting guidelines are and how many items you can post at what frequency so they can meet your guidelines! Having no information available and constantly changing your standards is kinda ignorant!"
112,Captain Mongoose123,"May 26, 2018",1,"So bad that I had to write a review Facebook is where I like to share with my friends and family back home photos and videos of my life living overseas. However, I have the hardest time doing that because of several reasons: (1) There‚Äôs a 40 photo limit, which is an inconvenience because users who take a lot of photos and videos would have to upload their photos in batches and it can be very time consuming. (2) The app lags while typing out captions and completely crashes after maybe the 10th caption, thus wasting a lot of time. (3) The MOST frustrating thing is that after all that typing and finally clicking upload, none of the photos upload. So I have to do it all over again. Oh wait, actually they did upload...3 weeks later so I ended up with doubles of the same photos. This happens every single time without fail and it is a complete waste of my time. This app should make it more convenient to upload photos straight from your phone, but instead it makes it 10 times more complicated."
113,Key player,"June 2, 2018",1,"Freezing up is a problem, and I can't watch videos most of the time The app works sometimes and sometimes it's frustrating! Exactly when you are watching something or trying to post and it just goes away like it shuts down. As someone else said you have to reboot to get things back. Seems like with each update instead of fixing bugs, it adding them. I like a lot of the new features if the app would work all the time. I know it could be in the internet as well, always busy!!!"
114,Lblblblblblblb,"July 8, 2018",2,"Blocked with no reason stated Blocked without any reason given or told for how long. I have a business page through Facebook that I cannot get into now. No way to contact my customers because I relied on messenger. I‚Äôve often wondered why some people I know haven‚Äôt been on Facebook anymore or as often. But I have since found out, they use Instagram for less hassle. I guess now that Facebook has blocked me for sharing out a link to enter a drawing to maybe about 10 friends... I‚Äôm guessing mind you, because all the pop up message said was to say I was moving too quickly which doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. Really? So it must be because they think I‚Äôm spamming my friends that are on my list of friends."
115,Zonata @ GSHIS,"October 8, 2018",1,"Mark Zuckerberg is really Jacob Michael Greenberg who also uses the name Jake Becker. Due to an arrest of the IPO of Facebook in Maricopa county Arizona, we find out his real birthdate.  The birthdate they report in the IPO filing with the SEC is fraudulent, in order to make him old enough to have attended Harvard as they claim is where he created the Facebook platform.  This is all a lie.  There are two violations and whistleblower papers have been filed on him for."
116,Windy13007,"November 14, 2018",5,"Security Excellent 5 Stars FB gets a gold star for security! Yes, somehow I was locked out of my account and I FREAKED OUT! I‚Äôm sure some of you have done this too!?!? After calming myself down and reading through the long long list of what not to do and what to do when you‚Äôre locked out... I sent an email to FB and a photo of my government issued ID, ...and kazaam back in action. If I had to create another account, it would have been a travesty-disaster!! I hear people say they have four or five accounts all the time, what a nightmare. We all store photos on FB so you understand, right?! Applause to the FB team for restoring my credentials and getting me back into my ONLY FB account quick and easy. Just send them your photo ID and get back into your account. It‚Äôs for your safety!!! FB‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you Security team! Member since 2008üëçüèº"
117,The shmurdera,"December 19, 2018",1,"Holding me hostage I dont want to use this platform anymore. You guys cannot be trusted. Its not just the ceo or the executive but the engineers, product managers, data Scientists, marketing, business dev.  etc. that allow these things to happen, that build these feature and functionality and make partnerships to sell this. Why did the people who work at facebook think this was okay for all these massive breaches of privacy. You guys are consumers too, you set new standards for what is okay and can influence industries so dont say everyone else is doing it or privacy isnt going to be a thing anymore. If its not its because you had a massive part in taking it away. "
118,lessiecamp,"December 6, 2019",1,"Stands with bullies. I was banned from posting for three days after calling a woman a name after she openly mocked mentally handicapped & disabled people, including one of my family members (who is a minor). I reported her comments which weren‚Äôt found to be considered ‚Äúagainst community standards for bullying‚Äù but my comment did. After waiting through the three day ban I was informed I would not be allowed to post to any comment section except for my own friends. It‚Äôs disgusting to me how Facebook thinks they are able to police any & everything said but can‚Äôt manage to police what actually needs to be policed. I‚Äôd hope at some point the ignorant people running & working for Facebook would take the time to ACTUALLY review what was said. In the mean time I guess they‚Äôll continue to stick with disgusting people who mock the disabled & mentally handicapped."
119,Cheekz89,"March 2, 2020",4,"I know how you can improve on the FB platform So FB is cool, ive been using it for years. Back when you had to have a valid college email address to create an account. Yep, im that old. And i hate to admit it, but i use it everyday now but not like i did in the past, where i just simply logged on the be nosy and like pictures of the girls i hd crushes on. Now I mainly just stick with communicating witn the people in the different FB im in. Side note: most are health related. This is by far the best time imo, to create a separate app just for communicating with your groups. Call it FB Groups or whatever, you want but it needs to happen soon. Being apart of groups with other likeminded people really is great and has become a whole other interaction thats far more worthwhile than previous ‚Äúera‚Äôs‚Äù of the platform. Other than that the app itself is fine, just wish id see less ads."
