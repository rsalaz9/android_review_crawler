0,ewizard,"May 25, 2019",5,"Updated review and Fix for pairing oculus quest Okay, I finally got past the pairing issue I had where the oculus quest refused to pair. It turns out it was an issue where the iPhone required an iOS update and once I did that, it paired no problem. Developers should please add this to the help with setting up an oculus quest. After that, smooth sailing. App is great, quest works really well. While the battery life will last about 4 hours, it’s still good enough because you don’t want to be in it too long. All the apps and games are great. I hope more become available soon and that more become cross play as I have an oculus rift also and would enjoy some of those games on the quest as well. Beat saber is crazy good! Also, the oculus app has no lag or issues and you can find the games easy. I would like to see a complete browse all feature so you can scroll through every game available - not sure if I missed it. App is same on phone as it is within headset. Flawless integration. I would like to see a power off feature inside the headset instead of pressing and holding the button to shut down. Keep up the great work!"
1,Roxtar73,"October 1, 2019",5,Great app for Quest owners I e seen many 1 star reviews that make no sense. They are rating the app based on their experience with their headsets. If I were to review the Oculus Quest it would definitely get 4.5 stars. The app however gets a full five stars as it does so much cool stuff. My favorite thing is being able to check my battery while charging my headset. Also being able to see if I need new batteries for my controllers is awesome. I know those data points are on the Quest Menu Bar but when your charging you may not have the Quest available to check so you can use the app. I love that I can buy and install games directly to my headsets from the app too. There are just so many cool things this app allows you to do. I’ve seen lots of tech and I’m not easily impressed by tech nowadays however the Oculus Quest and this companion app have highly impressed me. I haven’t been wowed like this by tech since I first wrote a program in basic back on a TRS-80 (Trash 80 for those who remember them) in the mid 80’s(I’m old I know). Thanks for an exciting and joyous experience both in the app and on the console.
2,Samid Al-Hazared,"March 28, 2019",5,"Set up utility for Oculus Go worked Ok Worked fine and used it to get oculus go set up. This app has the store and setup screens for the stand alone headset, and recently added WiFi streaming, which was really helpful when showing relatives what VR is like because I could put their view on the phone and help talk them through how to play better and they could give each other advice.  They really enjoyed the Keep Talking and Virtual Virtual Reality ones. "
3,Captdax,"October 16, 2018",2,"Still no casting (Major Fail) I love the idea of the go and I enjoyed the initial implementation of the headset. That being said the only issue that I have a problem with now that’s ruining the experience is that there is still no casting or a release date. If you aren’t ready to activate casting then why put it into the app update notes? Also, why is it that despite being a major feature request, there’s zero information about its progress or an estimated release date other than “soon”. If you really want your initial go adopters to push for your product then why take away the one thing that could help them promote the headset to others? In summary, it’s a fun headset for a while but without the added social feature you might use the headset once every couple of weeks just to see if there’s anything new (which there won’t be)."
4,ApallingPoodle,"April 11, 2020",5,"Almost Perfect! I love the easy access to the oculus store. I really appreciate that I do not have to put my headset on every time I want to buy a game my friend tells me about. I love that I can start a game in the headset before I’m ready to play it to warm the headset up and reduce loading times. One thing is missing though: Often, I will find an amazing game in the Oculus AppStore, and I will want to share it with a friend. Unfortunately, either there is not a “share app” button, or it is just really hard to find. Please add a “Share App” button in the Oculus Store! I would love to be able to send my friends a direct link to the cool new game I want them to try!"
5,KingOfOWtlaws,"September 7, 2019",2,"Unable to sort app reviews or access version notes I love using this app as it makes it much easier to manage apps on the Oculus Quest, but with the recent update I no longer have the ability to sort app reviews or access the version + release notes. I like to sort the reviews by most recent for when apps are upgraded so I can get a better idea of how the app is now instead of seeing older reviews. Also, I can’t access the version + release notes for applications anymore either. I use to be able to click on the version + release notes under the app details and see what has been updated on an app. I am still able to do this if I access the Oculus store from a PC so I am using that as a workaround, but it would be great if you all could restore these functions back to the iOS app."
6,Rockytoad,"June 23, 2018",5,"Are commenters trolling?  Easy setup I was reading the comments, and most of the 1 stars are bizarre.  I can’t tell if they are trolling or completely confused to be nice.  (Anyone read the comment about watching Netflix in VR from the app🤔)"
7,cybercookie72,"January 29, 2020",5,Good app that’s getting better all the time I been using the app since it showed up on App Store.... LoL sort of need it for the quest.   And it was a rough start but they have been working on improving it and it’s gotten sooooooo much better. We use the casting all the time so we can help our special needs kiddo play....would love to see some sort of accessibility feature that helps with sight like a zoom for the casting where tapping the screen puts a zoomed bubble next to the finger to help with reading things... thanks for all the hard work
8,Cdeanme,"February 15, 2019",4,"Important problem with battery So, recently my phone has been draining its battery, and I went to check Battery in settings. As the title may imply, it said the Oculus app was eating up /50% of my battery/"
9,A kid who tryed fortnite,"December 27, 2019",5,"Great app! I got a quest and was worried that it would not connect because of the bad reviews on the app and such. However, I was very impressed when I got it! Setup took only ten minutes and got up and running quickly!  When I did not like a game, I asked to refund it and got a refund that same day!  Also you can check the battery life from your phone so I knew when I needed to charge. Casting is great. I played a game while my brother watched and we both had fun! Overall, very impressive with no cons!"
10,iOSUpdated,"July 22, 2018",5,Great side app for oculus go! I use this app almost everyday to look at games. The app has a great theme to it which makes it easy to look at. The only request I have about the app is the paying options. I get iTunes cards often but don’t use them because I have nothing to use them on. I really hope at some point you could add support for iTunes gift cards.
11,Mrs Carr,"September 2, 2018",4,"Why doesn’t the App support Apple Pay! I like the VR experience, but I don’t understand why you have to enter payment information in the app. Usually all Apps use the payment feature from your iTunes account. Is it because of the privacy terms or how facebook gives information to third-parties? Or why not Apple Pay it’s more secure... Please some of the games offered on Oculus say they will collect email & phone numbers and information from files... now please tell me what files are third parties looking at on your phone..."
12,Jordan_Bouret,"December 25, 2018",5,"A Must-Have App I am writing this review regarding the Oculus app, not the VR experience (which is also amazing)."
13,leeleyae,"December 29, 2018",1,"Both headset and controller don’t work at all I was excited to receive my oculus go when I ordered it from the website and it worked well for the first week but after that the sound would stop working, my controller stopped connecting and eventually stopped working all together and now my headset won’t even turn on even after being charged for hours, the light doesn't come on either. Im very upset that I wasted a hefty $215 on it for it to stop working before even an years mark. I want my money back or for a solution to this issue because another friend of mine with the same headset is having the exact problem."
14,Someone influential,"March 28, 2019",2,"Not downloading apps... I own two headsets and neither of them will allow me to re-download apps like showtime anytime, do now and Facebook 360... again BOTH headsets experiencing this issue.. one just purchased last night out of the box. When it works it is alright but when it doesn’t it’s annoying... also the oculus app on the phone is terrible... all we need to see are fresh new apps and the ones that are installed... the fact that we can’t even easily see which apps are installed on the phone is very annoying to say the least."
15,Devistator,"July 15, 2019",5,"Corrected my issues Previous issues I had are corrected the the app, I am happy. Works flawlessly for me, and I love that I can start a download from work and come home and the downloaded apps, games and videos are ready to go! Great job. Only one hope in the future.  Would love to play game videos in wide screen. The small sized video on a phone would be made better by being full screen. But such a minor concern. Thank you for the fixes you perform. Hope quest gets more games soon!"
16,Dwelles,"March 9, 2020",3,"Casting to Chromecast / TV Hey team, I have an Oculus Go & and an Oculus Quest my company recently bought to utilize for event marketing. We’re a large venue trying to use VR to show our clients various event setups that we do, and before we launch our program we’re testing all the bugs for Chromecast capabilities on both platforms. So far, we’ve had great trouble getting consistent casting out of our devices—often being unable to connect headsets to our office TVs and even our phones from time to time—trust me when I say I’ve looked at all the troubleshooting guides. WiFi is not an issue as we have high-speed internet, and a brand new Chromecast device. "
17,Fluffhead44,"March 23, 2020",2,"No User Profiles People have been screaming at oculus to have multiple user profiles instead of locking the oculus down to one facebook profile and they’re completely tone deaf to the issue. this means that you really can’t share it with your family and friends the way you can with any video game console or computer. so i can’t save my progress in a game and then let my kids save their progress in the same game. or i can’t have my favorite browser pages bookmarked without mixing them with my families, or saved videos and so on. if you want to share a vr headset with family or others i’d suggest looking elsewhere."
18,Heheiwjsbegqywudjegw,"January 9, 2020",3,"Love the game play, hate the pairing. Numerous users have had issues with pairing their devices to stream their game play, whether it be for Twitch, Mixer or just so you’re not awkwardly swinging your arms around in front of your friends at a get together. "
19,Linhao,"June 27, 2019",5,Fantastic product Totally beyond expectations.
20,CentralCoding,"September 6, 2018",5,Crashing Issue I will rate it five because of the gameplay and app usage but for some bizzare reason it crashes for me every 35 seconds when I log onto the app. Please fix this. I can barely read a game description without an app crash. Every single time it crashes it sends me to my phone homescreen. Please fix this. I can barely use my Oculus now.

22,MCGamer823,"May 26, 2019",4,"I Love It and the Quest. I love how easy it is to setup an Oculus Quest, and I’m assuming it’s easy for the Rift, Rift S, and Go, too. I also like the casting feature, and I get why you can’t cast or record Beat Saber (Copyright reasons). One thing is that it doesn’t show the “Allow Quest to cast” straight away, I have to hold the Oculus button for it to show up, and it takes me a while to get to the home page by pressing the Oculus button. But, all and all, it’s easy, nice, and amazing!"
23,NKProds,"May 27, 2019",2,Great hardware but buggy software I love the Oculus Quest however there are some issues that are really breaking my experience.
24,ⒷⒺⒶⓃⓏⓣⓘⓜⓔⓩ,"June 6, 2019",1,"Can’t even set boundaries I have an oculus quest and it asked me to set boundaries it was difficult but I got through it and eventually made it in to the main menu. I then went to dinner and when I got back the VR asked me to set boundaries yet again, annoyed I did this again but then the machine wouldn’t let me submit them. The oculus support does not help at all so don’t tell me to go there. For such a expensive product you would think that they would work out simple bugs. Very disappointed and I can’t rate it any higher because I haven’t been able to get in to the thing. What a waste of money."
25,DaTrakKillah,"January 3, 2020",4,Oculus Quest is so SICK Highly recommend the Quest! My son loves it and we play it together all the time. 
26,Joe_Lutz,"December 16, 2019",3,"Why no iPad version? The app works well enough on my iPhone, but I’m surprised that it‘s not a universal app that works well on iPad. iPad is perfect for casting, but performs poorly due to the this being merely an upscaled iPhone app. A proper iPad (or universal) version of this app with landscape orientation support is much needed, in my opinion. Please make it happen guys! Otherwise I’m extremely pleased with my Oculus Quest and continually impressed with the latest innovations. I would just love for this app to match the level of polish of the headset."
27,TheTruthfullReporter,"December 7, 2019",5,"Refund If anyone is having issues with getting their money back, I did too. It at average takes a week for me, but last time it took about twenty days. You just have to be patient. Other than that I t is a great app. Does everything well, except I would like a different style friends menu. It doesn’t really tell anything."
28,Ann1611,"May 1, 2020",1,"OCULUS IS USELESS NOW, DESERVES ZERO STARS My sister and I were using Oculus to meet in a private room so that we could chat, etc. She is not allowed to have a Facebook account because of a control freak husband and I haven't been on Facebook for over two years and don't miss it. On Facebook, I couldn't ever log in privately, because Facebook wants everyone to know that you are online or actively using messenger, etc. Now Facebook wants to carry that crap over to Oculus. I'm glad I had only bought a few APPS for Oculus and didn't waste any more money than I did for the expensive crappy useless toy."
29,carbonware,"July 24, 2019",4,"Love my Oculus but it needs to connect to my tv I have a recently bought Sony 4K with built in Chromecast but can not connect it. My family likes to watch each other play but the Oculus refuses to connect. I don’t need an Apple TV or a Chrome Ultra just for this. It makes no sense why a wireless device can’t connect to a state of the art smart tv, no matter what additional apps I buy for my iPhone. Otherwise I love it."
30,MrMaxxPower,"January 13, 2019",3,A good app with a wide selection of VR experiences There are two features I would like to see implemented.
31,Blank_screenname,"March 7, 2019",1,"What a waste of money Played with the Go headset for about 30 minutes and I just wasn’t at all impressed. PR was fantastic selling this half-baked VR. The content is simply not there and the tech behind the Go is just not worth the expense to the consumer. There are too many hyped reviewers that are misleading prospective customers. Too many claims are made and the unit doesn’t deliver. “Crystal clear optics” yeah, no. I’ll be sharing a detailed review on my website geared to consumers in the upcoming days. Don’t buy the Go, and if you buy the quest get it from a store that allows returns."
32,Toddep23,"May 26, 2019",4,"love the oculus quest One obvious addition that needs to be added to the quest is the ability to watch movies and access media while laying down and in the dark. Perhaps using the joysticks? Other than that I love it so far. Please add this feature, it is much needed and shouldn’t be too hard to implement relative to the other things that the quest can do."
33,KyMom27,"July 19, 2019",3,"Oculus Quest Needs Multiple Users feature While I have had no problems with the app itself other than casting issues at times, I am disappointed that the Oculus Quest doesn’t allow for multiple users. Our whole family uses this headset and this lack of feature makes it impossible for one user to start a game and save their progress while another user starts the same game from the beginning."
34,Nerd is the word,"April 10, 2020",5,"The app is good, but a suggestion This app for all intents and purposes does exactly what it needs to. But there are some quality of of life things that could be added. Being able to add something to your wishlist on the app would be nice, in case you’d like to stay out of the headset for a little bit comes to mind."
35,Manuel acosta lopez,"December 26, 2019",3,WiFi problem I have had my oculus quest for a few days now and I have been struggling with it because it keeps disconnecting from WiFi due to a authentication problem and it is very annoying but other than that it is still very fun and entertaining to use and I really do hope that this problem is fixed soon as possible as I know that I am not the only one has this problem.
36,FrachlitzGamng,"January 27, 2020",5,Casting I’ve been having a lot of casting problems. I’ve used the advice to shut down my phone and restart the Oculus Quest and it worked but then it stopped. So I did it again but this time it didn’t work. Maybe their is a bug that y’all can fix. Please try to fix this.
37,Vgvuvuvuhuvyfgsh,"January 1, 2020",4,"Casting Issues This app is not terrible, it is helpful for setting up your oculus headset and purchasing apps and games from the oculus store. The reason I give it 4 stars is for the consistency of the casting to your phone. They need an update that fixes the reliability of it because it is a great function for showing family and friends what the person using VR is seeing."
38,Jonathan20051003,"November 29, 2019",3,Casting fail I don’t know why but the casting feature isn’t working my phone is up to date and so is the app and my quest and phone is on the same WiFi and they are connected and when I try to cast it says the headset is not found and it tells me to make sure they are on the same WiFi and try again but they are on the same WiFi and it just keeps saying the same thing
39,Mugajoe,"December 14, 2019",1,Used to be Great I was very happy with the way the app worked and functioned. Could find friends and hang out easily in VR. This is no longer possible as they are now “using Facebook to power social features”.
40,awon8d,"June 20, 2018",3,Fixed: Does not open Update: uninstalling and reinstalling the app solved my problem so upping my score. Still no more than a three simply because it broke and required to setup the Oculus Go.
41,skrems,"August 15, 2018",5,"Love the Oculus Go - hate the app! Crashes on start! The Oculus Go headset is incredible! Immersive, wireless, comfortable and performs fantastic. "
42,Vancehuang,"July 14, 2019",4,"Nice app overall, streaming is hard to set up by yourself though Has a lot of nice features, but streaming is really hard to set up on your own. You have to keep a hand on the screen while setting it up on the phone, otherwise streaming breaks as soon as you move your head away."
43,TeKno Ziz,"April 6, 2020",3,"Landscape, Landscape, Landscape Not all of us are iPhone owners, not all of us like to hold our iPads vertically in our hands? When will developers see the need for their apps to work in landscape mode? Based on a study I read online, most iPad users prefer landscape mode, especially if using a portfolio or an external keyboard. Come on guys, this is super annoying... Otherwise, the app is decent. Love my Quest!"
44,AtomBacon,"January 8, 2020",4,"Pretty good partner but... A very competent home app, very nice how it allows shopping and settings and such from outside the headset too. I’d just like to request some more stability for connecting the phone to the headset stream, it doesn’t always find it easily, as well as better stream quality, it freezes or skips frames a lot."
45,Timothytripp,"November 27, 2019",4,"Pretty good but needs landscape support for storefront videos I don’t understand why the app doesn’t show App Store videos full screen, as this seems to be in almost every app that plays videos.  It doesn’t need full-time landscape, just in the store for the preview videos.  If they add this I’ll give it 5 stars instead of 4."
46,set.h17,"October 19, 2019",1,"Couldn’t be worse I’ve never seen a worse app, the purchasing system is broken and the quest itself is the worst gaming system around, terrible quality games, doesn’t work half the time, the charging for the quest is janky, you have to charge it all day just to get 20 mins of play time tops. I’ve never regretted a larger purchase more than this. For purchasing an app you have to have the pin, the pin doesn’t work, you can change the pin all you want, won’t work."
47,killer pup,"September 6, 2019",5,Amazing Love IT The app is great but the only thing that I would recommend is making it The IPad screen because I have an IPad and The screen is not in full screen and aside from that I love how you can buy apps / games directly from the app onto the Your VR headset. All in all the app is awesome
48,Brendan Burrick,"June 13, 2019",5,"Updating system software I love the oculus go and all the games I’ve played on it. However I can’t seem to get my oculus to download any software update past version 3.45 and I’m not sure why. I just bought a game that I would love to play, I just can’t get it to update"
49,brandonxanders,"March 23, 2020",4,Needs Camera Roll Support! This app should include a place where you can see and download clips from your camera roll(on your Oculus Device) to either save directly to your phone or post on social media. A bit cumbersome to have to connect the Quest to a computer in order to get footage.
50,Jabbish123:),"June 30, 2018",4,"Slow The app is great in just about every way, I enjoy having an app that can link with my Go. However, the loading for the app can be crazy slow. Pictures for apps and games can take minutes to pop up which makes looking for new games troublesome."
51,SBlueDev96,"August 24, 2018",5,"Works great! This app works just fine! It hooked up seamlessly to my go and when you select apps to download, it puts them in queue on the oculus go and downloads start immediately. Very convenient for those who want to browse apps on their phone. 👍"
52,theevoxo,"November 10, 2019",5,"One thing... The ONLY issue I have is simple... Why can’t you change your profile picture at all ? I looked in the app and I even went to the website. That’s the only downfall. Other than that, everything is great."
53,tungstencarbide,"August 17, 2019",5,"Suggestion Add in iPad support. I would like to view the app on an iPad which has longer battery life. Plus I can see what is playing on the headset on a larger screen. Also, if you make this app support iPad (12.9 inch) make sure you support landscape mode."
54,Maddadpmh,"June 22, 2019",3,Casting Issues As of now the main appeal of the phone app is the ability to cast to chrome cast devices. 
55,Scimanyo,"December 29, 2019",4,Great app but not supported for iPad Pro Love the app on my phone but I feel it could get a tablet or iPad version. It looks pretty silly being tiny or stretched on a larger screen but would be easier to use for guiding first timers. I love that feature. Keep up the good work. 5 stars when it looks gorgeous on all screens.
56,beardstache,"January 9, 2020",2,Kinda bummed with the app Got a Quest a few days ago. Casting via the app has been god awful. It got even worse after the update to 12.0. Bought a Chromecast to attempt casting to. The app doesn’t even display the Chromecast even though I can easily cast any other app to it. Did a little searching on the internet and there are sooooo many complaints about this. Please tell me this will be resolved soon!
57,Unknown_boy001,"October 19, 2019",5,"Anyone know how to change profile picture? Hi, I have a oculus quest and I was trying every way I could think of changing my profile picture. Can anyone help me change my profile picture. I would prefer a method on iPhone."
58,GOLD3N_TNT,"August 28, 2019",4,"Really Useful! This app really helps with managing your Oculus headsets, and downloading apps without putting on the headset. The instructions are very easy to follow and show you how to set up your headset. I would still be trying to reset my Oculus Go controller of it wasn’t for this app. If you own an Oculus headset, this is definitely recommended"
59,ananEsther,"March 11, 2020",1,"I couldn’t find any app anymore I played on headset before and it worked fine. I could active apps on home or library. After I downloaded the quest in my iPad, there is nothing on home or library. On quest, I can find apps and click start. it shows the app has been activated, but after I wear the headset, the app shows for couple of seconds, then disappear. When I go to setting and application, it shows no permission.  What’s wrong with it? Please help!"
60,s parent,"January 12, 2019",1,"Joke- nope it's Silicon Valley sales It says stand alone on the box - the first thing you are asked to do is down load this App on your i-phone to enable your headset with very specific network requirements ...  Ridiculous ... if ""old"" product companies (GM, GE etc) told you your car/washing machine was stand alone, and the first thing they required is you owned a product from another company to operate you'd go ballistic and return the BS product ... which is exactly what I will do tomorrow.  GROW UP Silicon Valley ."
61,Squishnet,"December 26, 2019",5,"Excellent even without headset Now, I’m not that great at judging things but straight off the bat this app feels organized and well made. I’m about to get my quest so I haven’t tried everything, but I give it a thumbs up just for being excellent!👍🏻"
62,Bean Woots,"April 23, 2020",5,"New games (Quest) Hey Oculus! I love the gaming headset and I got a lot of cool games, but I was wondering if you could add more shooting games to the quest.

64,PokemonGoHater420,"January 25, 2020",4,"The app is great but needs ipad support. This app is awesome and helped me setup my quest, buy games, and cast so my friends can see what I’m playing, but it’s annoying that it’s in the format of an iPhone when I’m using an iPad. The 2 black bars on the side and low quality really make the app flawed on here."
65,kylefella123,"December 29, 2019",5,You may or may not be able to help me on this So everything works great on the oculus it’s just one thing the smell the gaming dosnt give me headaches the smell dose bc it’s right on your nose and the smell will give you that so if there are any tips on how to do that pleas tell me
66,KerBerBelZ,"April 13, 2020",5,Please read Everything is great but one problem!! DEVELOPER MODE does not work I made 4 organizations and it still won't turn on. it keeps directing me to the website please fix this as soon as possible!!
67,Remove portal pleeeez,"December 14, 2019",4,"Can you make games in app purchases? This is pretty good overall, and it’s nice how you can stream the headset to the device, but maybe make it so buying games is an in app purchase. I think it would be more convenient, plus you could gift cards to buys games."
68,MagnumPeon,"October 26, 2019",2,"Frustrating Oculus Go literally won’t allow me to pair with Facebook.  I keep getting new codes, come up with new passwords, I can see my Facebook profile pic through the Oculus goggles, but I can’t pair, which is frustrating since I’d like to use Oculus Venues, which you can’t do unless you pair with Facebook. About to tear my hair out.  I had an infinitely easier time setting up my brand new TV today.   PLEASE FIX."
69,rotin tomato,"February 3, 2020",5,Problem with the oculus quest So I wanted Pavlov and zero caliber and mine craft and blades and sorcery and final assault but nooo and if you say a space issue super hot son there I mean this is more of a feedback and I hope this gets the attention of the developer and they change it.
70,DapperSkippy,"August 4, 2018",5,Latest update is much better Most recent update fixed crashing app. I check it every day to see what the app of the day is. Much faster than the website
71,deetos lover 123,"February 8, 2019",5,Great The oculus go is a great easy to use system. This app just makes it easer. It enables you to browse and download games while your away from home.  The concept is great and the devs should never stop working to make it better.
72,Ewebecha,"February 8, 2019",4,Wishlist wish! Overall - the app is useful and easy to navigate. One thing it is missing is the ability to edit my wishlist.  I can not remove apps once I have purchased them. It clutters up my list... it should be easy enough to add this function.
73,Stop_theHATERS,"January 20, 2020",5,"Works Good! The app works great and I can cast to my chrome cast and iPad. I can’t cast with my phone though, there’s always a casting error. I’m not too worried about my phone casting though. It works great and that’s all that matters to me. The app is very convenient."
74,Infinity£,"October 7, 2019",3,Something is Wrong with the update function So I’ve been on both my VR headset and app on my iPhone and I don’t see any update or automatic update option please check this app and double check if you added the function I have an iPhone 7 Plus maybe that’s why because other than that idk
75,Toenails3997,"February 2, 2020",5,Great app and works great with my Quest I just recently got the oculus quest and am already astonished with how easy it is to use it with the app I’m out of my house a lot and I love being able to download games from my phone.
76,Fhtntdrj,"April 27, 2020",1,"amateur hour ... pairing/WiFi process is completely broken Spent hours trying to set the device up, to no avail. The saddest part is that this bug (“incorrect wi-fi password” even when correct) has been constantly reported on forums and official channels for the past two years!"
77,24HR Locksmith,"July 14, 2019",1,Dosent work on iPhone! You expect from a firm like Facebook to make sure the product is working as promised before sealing it in stores .
78,Supermitsuba,"July 10, 2019",4,"Works great The app works great for just about everything except sound.  If you have your silence switch on, the sound wont play for videos.  Flicking it on will make the video sound play.  This behavior is something I only see in this app."
79,person1345660,"December 15, 2019",3,I had some issues When I tried to put in my card information in the app it says “something went wrong. Try again.”So I tried several times even with a different card. I like most of the free games but I feel like I’m missing out on the paid games.
80,pugglesonyt,"June 1, 2019",5,Question So I love oculus but do you guys know if you are going to support steam vr on the oculus quest? Because I really like many of the steam vr games and I don’t have a very good pc so I’m probably gonna get the oculus quest but I don’t know if there is or ever will be compatible with steam vr.
81,Serakas Studios,"February 25, 2020",2,Audio isn’t working. This rating is harsh then normal since there is a bug in the app. I will fix the review once they fix the bug. At the moment audio is not working natively on my phone. Tried changing every setting I can and audio plays just fine on other apps so it’s not the phone. Fix your audio issues Oculus!!!
82,dadrain,"February 5, 2020",5,Quest I love all the games but there is one game that I would truly love to be added to the assortment of games and that is the game Blade and sorcery and if you could add that I would be so happy and many others would be to.
83,Cameonyomom,"November 5, 2019",4,"Good app, one problem for me Great app, does mostly what I ask of it. My only problem is that I am unable to cast in whenever or however I try. I’ve tried the troubleshooting steps, if it starts working, I’ll try my best to remember to update this review."
84,mexican42,"August 29, 2019",3,I can’t make purchases Whenever I try to add a new card to my payment info it says unable to add new payment. My friend said when he made a new account he was able to add a new card but I don’t want to make a new account and lose all my already purchased games
85,Tournys,"January 25, 2020",4,Great but... I would give this a 5 star because my oculus quest is amazing it has amazing graphics and gameplay. But when I wanna buy a game with a visa gift card I have to have the money on that gift card I can’t combine them together to purchase a game.
86,ArnoldplaysFaZe,"December 26, 2019",5,"I enjoy the use of this app I enjoy this app a lot, but I can’t add no payment methods or find any types of gift cards to redeem to buy games on the app. Is there anything that can be done about it?"
87,Ianbeing,"June 19, 2019",1,"Can't log in with fb account You goto be kidding me, just downloaded the app on my iphone to go with my new oculus quest. Open app, asks me to log in with fb account, tap continue, takes me to fb app, logs in, takes me back ro oculus app with a page says ""close this tab"", hit done, back to log in page, infinite loop, tried everything. A 5th world software company can make better software, how? How about make it USABLE for start?"
88,RiftyKai,"March 28, 2020",2,"It won’t let me download my preordered games So I preordered doctor who edge of time and still haven’t been able to play it, it just keeps saying “pre-ordered”. It won’t even let me download it through my quest. Can you please fix this because I payed MONEY, for something I can’t use and came out months ago. It’s no longer preordered, it’s now theft"
89,Legendarycute531,"January 13, 2020",2,"No support on IPad Pro The app has no actual support for the IPad Pro, its just the iPhone version squished into the screen. This makes casting look terrible, and the orientation of the device is not fit for the iPad. I don’t understand how this could’ve happened with a team like oculus behind it. Please provide a proper version that fits the iPad and its needs."
90,The boory👂👀👃👅,"March 2, 2019",3,"was fun got boring Should add more games. I bought the go because it was a lot cheaper than the black one. But was disappointed to see the games are more boring then the black one. Maybe add more FREE levels of face your fears, and add games like hello neighbor, granny, things of that sort. a lot more games is needed definitely"
91,dat boi Cam,"August 8, 2019",5,Payment There should be gift card payment options
92,to good to be free,"December 26, 2019",5,"For people having a hard time. For those boomers, you can’t refund online games, you must need a email. I love the oculus quest, you can bring it anywhere in the world."
93,Benjie324,"February 23, 2020",2,IOS Badge Notification Error This is the only app that shows a badge notification that has no notifications.  I literally would open the app and read the notification (sometimes no notification) but the badge on the app won’t disappear.  This is the only app that does this.
94,Minnie3212,"September 24, 2019",4,Plzzz our on Skyrim I looked at the trailer for Skyrim creeper on the ps vr and it looked great! But this does not have that and Mostly i hate that but maby you are just waiting for elder scrolls 6 to come out and that will be even better!
95,frisksfgsfjfsfjesjsd,"February 17, 2020",4,lags a big issue rn I’m having a bit of trouble with lag from the app I know it’s not my wifi because I turned data on witch btw I have unlimited- and it was very laggy other than that works great
96,Dyslexicon,"February 1, 2020",4,"Solid app - missing one thing. Had my Quest for a few days now, and I love it! The one thing that’s missing to make the experience complete for me, is this app on TvOS. I’d love to be able to cast games to my TV, without having to buy a Chromecast."
97,jdjshenahwhhemd,"March 20, 2020",4,"Can’t watch videos I know you need a Facebook account to watch recorded videos, but what about people who can’t have it like me. It would be very fun to watch my videos and show them to friends"
98,triggagaming,"November 15, 2019",4,Join java or mojang (we need Minecraft) I’d love to give this app 5 stars
99,GoldenDrPhil,"April 25, 2020",3,I would say great But the only thing I would say is there are no good games on oculus sure you have a couple but where is the fun in that I would say add steam to oculus so you wouldn’t need a computer to get steam to play the be games on steam or just add the games from steam onto the oculus library
100,Kmthunder,"January 12, 2019",4,Love the Oculus Go I’d give it 5 stars because the headset is the best for its price and is a great intro to VR. But can you get the app to rotate on my iPad so i can view it landscape?. It is apparently programmed for a phone more than a tablet. Screen rotation would be appreciated. Thank you.
101,Dksann,"February 11, 2019",2,Still needs work! 1. After current update today; in the patch notes it says “fixed bugs and crashes”. Well it was fine before but now it crashes after 5 mins
102,Jddanford,"January 10, 2020",5,"Great but.... This is amazing I’ve only had it for about 2 hours and I love it everything is great graphics to sound to mics, the one thing is paylov. We need paylov that would be awesome!!"
103,SleepyNarwal,"December 13, 2019",4,I can’t update I can’t update my Oculus Quest but I don’t know why? I’ve been looking up how to update manually and automatically but I haven’t been able to update it for some weird reason.
104,B_MAN74,"April 25, 2020",1,"One Star for Troublesome Horizontal Casting! Great app, but fails when trying to cast horizontally on an iPad device. If you start in the horizontal position, it casts upside down. To get it right side up, you have to start the casting when the iPad is vertical. By the time I get my headset off to position the iPad horizontally, the casting ends. Please fix this so we can start casting in the horizontal casting with the right orientation."
105,Kitty4abc,"February 26, 2020",4,"Great! But... I would like an easier way to access my wishlist such as a button next to the library or something, and a way to pay with my Apple ID balance."
106,mojo sm,"January 17, 2020",3,Oculus Hey you’re app is amazing an I really like it but I had to give you three stars because you cant download any apps off your phone witch then you have to turn on your oculus and downloaded an app that takes time but no other reason
107,N3WKI3,"October 18, 2019",5,"Stupid reviews I have no clue why people think This is some stupid mobile vr game ITS NOT this is an app for OCULUS OWNERS, anyway the only problem is the 1st connection takes a while and overall great app!"
108,STUG III,"November 27, 2019",5,Fantastic Super easy to use app. It perfect for reviewing all apps and games. You can even purchase the games you want one the app and the Quest will DL it. Great app. No complaints. I also link into Quest via app. Cool.
109,luke00000$,"November 1, 2019",2,Regret buying it I wish you could use some other form of payment not just PayPal or your cards because my parents won’t let me use their card for no reason and the games aren’t really that great. I regret buying it because It gets really boring quick and I don’t really use it.
110,jsidjfhdjdjdjs,"April 7, 2019",2,Seems fun but is a little unfair So recently I got a gear be for this app but when I went to go and pair the headset I realized you couldn’t because it was only compatible to the go and rift which in my opinion is a little unfair because now I bought a whole headset just for this but it’s not even compatible
111,Giusep81,"January 16, 2020",2,"Redesign 👎🏼 Honestly the App is fine, it does your typical search For Game & DL , as well as setting up your Quest. "
112,brodywoodham,"January 27, 2020",3,Good but not perfect I do like the app + the Oculus Quest itself. My main problem is buying games. I can’t be able to add a payment option (every time I do I always get an error message) so I’m hoping this error gets fixed very soon
113,Gorillasooner,"December 30, 2019",2,The device is great. The app won’t clear notifications My app gives me the red circle that there is a notification. I have read the messages but there is no way to delete them and the app icon keeps registering that there are u read messages with the red circle (a huge pet peeve of mine).
114,underwhelmed by ads,"December 26, 2019",1,My new Oculus Go still not updated yet It’s day 2 and I followed the instructions verbatim on How to Set Up and I am no further than waiting for the update to be complete 😕.  I read on online that some headsets were shipped out with the old firmware that is causing this issue.   I opened a support ticket on the Oculus site. Still nothing.  Christmas kinda sucked this year ☹️
115,higzz37,"September 6, 2019",1,Can’t create account I received my quest today.  I’ve tried at least a half dozen times (both on the app and the web) to create an Oculus only account. Every time I get to the point of sending the confirmation email to create the account it never shows up.  I kept hitting resend.....and nothing. I’m a little disappointed at this point.
116,Kenkchicago,"June 18, 2019",1,"Controller doesn’t work with all the app The experience with the Go is great however the control doesn’t work well with Spacewalk VR, Mission IIS. The visual is great but you can’t move, your stuck in space or in the same chamber. I read the instructions when the app opens but after that the control is useless. Also customer tech support is almost nonexistent"
117,Speedy_Zoom10,"March 31, 2020",5,One question Now this isn’t really a review I need help my cousin and me played this game and I loved it but I downloaded it and I don’t know how to play it thanks
118,trimbomakimbo,"December 10, 2019",1,Functional but annoying. Worked fine for setting up my new quest. Way too many stuck and spammy notifications though. 
119,Nabdbdb,"May 2, 2020",3,It’s good but can be better When are the games Pavlov and corn going to come out. I’ve been waiting for a long time for them to come out. Can you please get started on them so people who want them can play them.

121,Code_adan,"September 3, 2018",3,"Misleading app name This should be called Oculus Go. I have the rift and was excited to see an app that would allow me to use the store, view my library, maybe chat with VR friends, etc."
122,Billynaire,"January 15, 2019",4,It’s awesome VR I love it I enjoyed it with the VRI had fun it’s so worth it. It’s very clear and you will enjoy the difference of the regular gear but this one has more of a better quality and game if your game are you gonna like this
123,Deltawife,"January 23, 2020",3,Notifications! Ugh! This would be a five star review if my all icon didn’t always show my notifications and never clear them. I’m obsessive about having no notifications and this is killing me.
124,Seattle Sonos,"July 17, 2019",1,"Confirm email doesn’t work Unfortunately the confirm email process is broken.

126,Papusboss,"November 1, 2019",4,"iPad version The app is pretty good, I’d give it a five stars it wasn’t for the fact the app doesn’t scale properly on iPads! Can we get a native iPad version. This one isn’t really good to use on bigger screens"
127,GNathanGrice,"July 17, 2019",2,Enable Camera Roll access gone! Searched and searched the forums for an answer on this one but it seems like the option to directly review the camera roll is missing from the Oculus app. Bought the Go strictly to shoot and review 3d photos and videos and it’s just gone now. Help!
128,Alex_P5234,"April 29, 2020",5,Apple Pay please If there was Apple Pay I would make a lot more impulse purchases 💸 and oculus would make more money ... just sayin
