1,No Pasta,"May 14, 2018",1,Not Working I am unable to add any categories other than the only one I chose when I first opened the APP.  (Impossible to return to that page.) Tried deleting the APP and reopening.  
2,Jrrider1,"January 15, 2019",3,"Not as good as before The app was great a while back. Now they removed other features like magazine/news content.  It would have been good to be able to access this news content from the app. You put so much editorial work into it, not sure why you would remove it from being read and to increase readership on that content."
3,Cliffsonly1,"January 1, 2020",1,Devs Loss To the devs: Very unfortunate you get featured in Apple Apps and you don‚Äôt feature self representing artists...your loss!  Deleting app...sounds like you have further issues anyway...good luck...perhaps I will redownload if you get it together. 
4,mmmaxie,"April 17, 2020",5,"Great Online Market Source This site is well designed, intriguing and responsive with a minimum amount of stress. All parameters of the art transaction are clearly explained by logical tapping on proffered artwork or prompts. Never was I led down a rabbit warren of twists and turns, unable to return to where I started."
5,EricClampton,"January 9, 2020",5,"Some feedback I love the app, website etc. one thing that would be very helpful is if you could choose a currency to display prices in. While some individuals may have the conversion rate of Swiss francs to usd in their head, I do not."
6,L.Minor,"March 31, 2018",3,What happened to the articles??? I downloaded this app so I could read the interesting content Artsy puts out. But with the latest update I don‚Äôt see a way to get to the articles. Please restore this feature so I don‚Äôt have to go to the web separate from the app to read the great information you produce.
7,kgl12,"January 14, 2020",5,"My favorite way to discover new artists Using the Artsy app is such a positive part of my day!! I love how it‚Äôs organized, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to use, but best of all it allows me to discover new artists I haven‚Äôt heard of before."
8,Callen1707,"February 13, 2019",1,Can‚Äôt access account settings and website doesn‚Äôt work I rarely use this app and decided to delete my account after receiving an email from Artsy about a data security incident. I can‚Äôt do that because there is no way to access my account through the app. I‚Äôve tried to visit their website but it‚Äôs not coming up so I have no way to even reset my password like the email suggested I do.
9,Roy mercer,"July 1, 2018",5,"Very expensive. UX is great and so is the quality of works on the platform. With that said, it's far too expensive to justify the cost. A great up and coming system is called artcloud. Much more affordable and a comparable experience."
10,Estevan M.,"March 3, 2018",5,"‚ô•Ô∏è from Contemporary Collective Gallery! The best art experience on my iPhone! Running my gallery (@contemporarycollectivegallery) an online exclusive gallery, Artsy is crucial for reaching a vast audience of art enthusiasts and artists!"
11,truffleoink,"September 25, 2018",3,How to read articles? I love the artsy app but every time I try to click on an artsy link from Facebook/my browser it launches the app but doesn‚Äôt open the article. Unless I can‚Äôt figure it out there‚Äôs no way to read the articles on the app. Gave up on many articles because of this
12,zbaid,"September 26, 2018",5,"Love Everything but... Absolutely love the content, layout and functionality. Only thing I would like to see is a way to request artist to be added"
13,meeshu13,"October 15, 2018",2,"Facebook articles dead end in artsy app Every time I click on Artsy article in Facebook to read it, it automatically goes and opened my Artsy app but never takes me to the article. Just takes me to my feed of the artist I‚Äôm following. So annoying! I basically have no way of reading any articles unless I open on a lap top."
14,Suzannatouzet,"March 28, 2019",5,"Wow Absolutely love the new city guide. This is exactly what anyone interested in seeing arts needs!!! I‚Äôm obsessed with maps too, so having them together is the best. Thank you!!!"
15,Yoniben,"July 6, 2019",4,"Enjoyable I enjoy getting updates on artists and their work.  Most items are beyond my price range; or so my wife tells me, however there are pieces I‚Äôd love to own.  However,  I already have so much artwork, I‚Äôve no place to hang new pieces. "
16,D.J.Rufus,"January 7, 2020",5,Indispensable for art lovers Easy to discover and buy fine art from famous and emerging artists.   Like having every art fair in the world in your pocket.
17,sh$/ nickname,"April 28, 2020",3,"Magazine Format? I just updated after ages. The old app still worked, and the home was a magazine format with possibly articles and complications, but also large format pictures. Where did that go? It was visually very interesting."
18,TafOnTaf,"March 1, 2020",5,"Artsy is the Future of the Art World Whether you are an established or new collector, or if you‚Äôre simply an appreciator right now , Artsy is the one-stop-ship for your digital art appreciating endeavors."
19,Sooj.,"January 10, 2020",5,A great way to find out what is going on near me! A great way to find out what is going on in walking distance to my current location.
20,gadgetsguru,"May 7, 2018",1,"Absolutely useless! First, they expect you to create an account. I‚Äôm not even sure I like the app yet. I used a fake email and name. Next, the reason I downloaded the app in the first place - to try it out on my walls with VR - doesn‚Äôt even work. The lighting in my room is about as good as you can get, and this can‚Äôt detect my walls. Lame. üëé"
21,Francob63,"May 18, 2018",1,Unable to submit artwork to sell Was excited that App offered a way to sell art. Submission page asks to choose artist and it will not save selection. Asks to choose location of art and it will not save selection. Thus always fails on submit.
22,buttered jam,"December 14, 2018",5,How I stay arts-savvy! Following my favorite emerging talents lets me stay connected to the art world and make smart investments. Love the alerts when new works are added!
23,LJAlbers,"February 26, 2019",3,"Data breech issues The recent data breach prompted me to reset my password, but now I have lost data from previous email correspondence as well as art pieces that I was following"
24,AC Jung,"April 23, 2019",5,Perfect for galleries! This app is perfect to display gallery inventory as an Artsy gallery! I highly recommend it as a former gallerist who used Folio for on-the-go situations and in-gallery use for visitors!
25,anononinon108,"May 1, 2019",3,"Deep linking from emails doesn‚Äôt work Title basically says it all, I get emails from artsy and click on a link, it just opens the app without taking me to the art piece I clicked on."
26,elise3.14,"May 8, 2019",5,Beta for viewing art on wall is really cool Hope this becomes a full fledged feature!
27,jay arby,"October 27, 2019",5,"Accessible and fun I don‚Äôt even buy, I just scroll through. It‚Äôs like having a museum next to my wallet."

30,DRo dRo dRo,"December 17, 2017",5,Love it! Artsy is greatly comprehensive and the best resource I've encountered as an online extracurricular art magazine/pulse on the market.
31,Lola III,"February 3, 2018",2,"Could be much better Solid collection but a bit stupid app. No fullscreen for the works, no option for download"
32,artgame1141,"March 2, 2018",5,"Gazing for days This app is a never ending tunnel for art gazers. It‚Äôs fun to casually surf, bid, as well as keep up with the latest events."
33,Kevin in Erie,"March 4, 2018",1,Purchased Art Never Received It Beware of purchasing art from this site! I purchased two pieces and never received them. There is no customer service or contact information. Total scam.
34,Pic- one,"April 29, 2018",4,Agree! Where are the articles?    The only thing I love to read...GONE?
35,SpartanAustin,"September 18, 2018",1,"Why create an art app that won‚Äôt let you discover art? Who created this thing? Ridiculous. Unless you know the name of the artist, you won‚Äôt find anything new using this app because you cannot add categories."
36,neutercraft,"November 14, 2018",1,buy and SELL There should be a selling option and i can‚Äôt find it nowhere in the app. I think i saw it when i first opened the app but now it‚Äôs like it never was there. What use is the app this way?
37,Ngpetersen3,"November 20, 2018",4,Can‚Äôt sell works You cannot sell works as stated.

42,SarahSuku,"October 1, 2018",1,App fails to load any content App fails to load any time i click on content within Artsy‚Äôs emails. Hasn‚Äôt worked for a year now..
43,Walla truly,"October 12, 2018",1,Email at launch? Ridiculous You want my email to even launch the app before you establish value.  How moronic.  This is a quick delete.

46,dhhvubfhjib,"February 13, 2019",1,App is crashing Latest iOS on iPhone xs - the app is crashing and freezing. Crashes and closes after less than a minute of browsing.
47,socalartguy,"February 16, 2019",1,"What a let down So I understand this app.  I understand how it can be useful around the world.  For a silent Auction at a fundraiser, not appropriate.  Talking about sucking out the fun in the room and then...the lag time for bidding.  #notcool"
48,sskab,"September 20, 2019",5,"Great for artists Not a collector, but it‚Äôs a great tool to catalog contemporary works and influences."
49,JJohns 43,"December 24, 2019",2,Annoying The app keeps randomly closing. Irritating!
50,Ghjhdsgjnfs,"October 3, 2017",5,Great App I love the art featured on Artsy.

56,StunningAndy,"January 3, 2019",1,How come? How come the Artsy app doesn‚Äôt have any of the Artsy articles on it?
57,PB779,"March 1, 2019",1,Unable to submit info about art I am selling Waste of time. The app keeps failing on me
58,Rouperto,"April 25, 2019",1,Bad user interface Their poorly performing UI does not make me want to trust them with my money.
59,levyxi,"June 1, 2019",1,Terrible:( Not able to sell any art! This is terrible someone please help me!
60,Orlaithfinucane,"September 20, 2013",5,"Artsy never fails to blow me away They have taken all of the gorgeous UX and features from the web product and created a lovable pocket sized vsn to use on the go. It is so easy to navigate, the content is excellently curated and the design is simply beautiful. I will spend hours learning, browsing and writing my Christmas list from this wonderful app. I love it!"
61,Mimi O Chun,"September 21, 2013",5,"Bravo! The Artsy app heralds a big step forward not only for mobile app design or the art world, but humankind at large. Nowhere else can one discover such a rich gold mine of formal, verbal, or conceptual inspiration--whether you're completely new to the art world, a die-hard enthusiast, or a serious collector. The typography and iconography are exquisite, the interactions are intuitive and responsive--all while keeping the work center stage. It's a complete rabbit hole in terms of engagement, and will undoubtedly be responsible for a decrease in Instagram browsing, more missed stops on the train--but more broadly, democratizing a world that has remained the purview of a select few for far too long."
62,shortstop,"September 24, 2013",3,"Poor display of the art Perhaps I misunderstand how to use the app, but I find it's display of the actual art to be very disappointing. "
63,Simone'sWorld,"November 12, 2013",5,"Great App, but Needs More I love this app, not for the art you can purchase, but for the older works of art I would love for the app to include the history around each work of art. Like the Mona Lisa and how it was made, the myths behind the painting and how it came to be. It would also be great to include even more history about the artist as well. I would as like to see updates of old and new artwork."
64,Gold rockstar,"January 27, 2015",5,"A lil problem Hey so love the app it is wonderful! I have grown to appreciate so much more art and mediums than ever before. I do have a concern, for about a month now anytime I try to search for an artist, the app shuts down. I click on the artist's name and the app freezes and then blanks out or something. It tells me when I go into the app to send a report but the problem persists. Help! :)"
65,TechiePoobah,"July 5, 2015",5,"Beautiful app! I'm not sure what others are complaining about. The pictures are clear and beautiful, and I can easily zoom in and examine sections closely. The app connects flawlessly to the Internet and a simple click lets you sign in with Facebook; just how lazy are we as a culture now?! And as far as the complaint about the artwork, these are current shows and artists work available now; how is this not representative of current art? Many styles and genres are represented and anyone is certain to find some very inspiring treasures. And I love being able to save work to my own ""collection"" and view over and over. Excellent app!"
66,Superior Skyler,"July 22, 2015",5,"Beautiful and Inspiring. As an artist, I enjoy observing and learning about different works, new and old. However, my current living arrangements do not allow me to get out to explore this alternate world of shape and color. Artsy has become my favorite app to find inspiration and clarity, while offering more features than some physical museums or galleries can. While I would rather travel to France or Amsterdam to experience these works in person, Artsy has given me the next best thing.  You do not have to be exceptionally educated either, as Artsy offers resources and insight into pieces you may find interesting. I highly recommend this app to anyone who enjoys either making or observing art of all different mediums, movements, and styles."
67,KevinTaylorMcCauley,"April 1, 2016",5,"Smartest Art App I've tried quite a few similar apps and, as both a top-sheet glance and a thoroughly detailed account of what's happening in the contemporary art field, this app far outperforms the others in every way. Of special note is how successfully it maps out the relationships within the art world. I don't know if it's in the search algorithms being used or maybe it's in the nature of the user community the app has attracted, but the links offered, the relationships suggested, and the information flow in general are consistently spot on...both intuitively true and factually accurate. This means not only that the dataset is navigable as a faithful rendering of the art world at any given moment, but also that as I use the app, almost automatically, I encounter precisely the kind of new material I would have otherwise hoped to find. I use this tool daily."
68,ThamesA,"May 7, 2017",5,"Terrific art resource! I found a marvelous must-have piece within minutes of my first browse, contacted the dealer and bought it PDQ. Good thing I did, and that Nadine Witkin of Gallery Alpha 137 honored my bid, because within a day or so other, she received higher offers. So now I'm de-accessing and looking forward to selling with Artsy too. Highly recommended. "
69,Sharp317,"July 27, 2017",5,"AN ART(SY) WORLD VIEW FROM PHONE! üòç To be able to view all of the art of my favorite artists that I not only did not know ever existed, but never knew I could ever even be able to view is BEYOND a dream come true.  I only hope that, one day, if I am able to get a show for my beauty from the ugliness of the realities of the world that the average [upper middle class] person ignores photography, I will be able to afford to purchase a piece of one of my dreams.  Until then, I will continue to adore ARTSY and praise and learn about the art world from its site.  SHALOM üïä"
70,Peanutbuttter,"September 19, 2013",4,"Beautiful, smooth, and fun A great app for anyone who loves art or wants to learn. I've been a fan of the Artsy desktop site for a long time and am thrilled with the new app as well. I love that you can swipe through your favorites -- it's a fun and cool way to show friends the art I love. Will give five stars when the posting feature arrives!"
71,Art Market Maven,"November 15, 2013",5,"Indispensable tool for art collectors and enthusiasts A stunning, easy to use app which makes it effortless to navigate the art world. The shows and artworks are limitless and you can see everything from classical antiquity to what Gagosian Gallery brought to Art Basel. Comprehensive and absolutely addictive."
72,Scribbler17,"December 29, 2015",5,"Every Day As a beginning collector, I used Artsy to discover the first major work of art I acquired.  I love the feature which allows you to ask for the price of something directly from a gallery. I also use it to remember the artists and works I like."
73,funnyfun,"January 8, 2016",5,"An Amazing Art App For professional or beginning artists... or people who just enjoy the visual arts, this is a great app. You can find all categories of artists who work in different mediums, and peruse their masterful art pieces. This app also posts various articles and links. Highly recommend."
74,md2d,"March 12, 2016",5,"Wonder-full assembly: gorgeous lay-outs First, observing the site continuously affords a sense of enjoyment and peace. Coverage of liked characteristics and the ability to further personalize viewing focus, thanks to your attention to feedback, enhances depth of learning and desire to engage, exchange and build appreciation for the beauty and creative skills of numerous, talented individuals."
75,Kathy088,"April 22, 2016",5,"Useful - and fun - in every way I love Artsy and now own a gorgeous painting because of it. The App enables me to follow artists I like and learn about new ones. And I can connect up to their galleries. So much more to offer and mostly, it gives me my daily art fix and lots of information about what's going on in the art world."
76,Sosososodope,"September 26, 2016",5,"A profound way to experience art A lot could be said about how great this app is, but I'll keep it short by saying Artsy has definitely changed the way I seek out and experience art. Just the ability to follow artists and discover new ones is worth it alone. Thanks Artsy crew!"
77,ClayK2000,"November 5, 2016",5,"Fast but missing auction results Artsy's app is one of the best for art and much better than the auction houses own apps.  It's fast, easy to navigate and has great information.  I just wish that the PM would add auction results since it's by far the best feature on the site."
78,abmccull,"June 6, 2017",5,"Beautiful, Intuitive, and Worth It. I have enjoyed Artsy's website for years now, and their app is the perfect companion to their great collection. It is beautifully designed, and easy to find new and interesting art. Their recommendations are good, and the shows they display are fascinating. Keep doing great things!"
79,Liquidzone,"August 25, 2017",5,My favorite app Thank you so much for this amazing app.  Exploring thousands of works of art from galleries around the world without leaving my home is a dream come true.  Visiting museums and galleries is one of my favorite activities but I am disabled with limited mobility so your app is very appreciated and valued.
80,zmoney,"April 20, 2014",5,The pandora of art and more! Fantastic app doesn't just help me buy art but also discover new artists. Really amazing stuff. Can't believe it wasn't around before.
81,Tucker Hughes,"November 13, 2014",1,"Facebook integration glitch I have an account on the website that is linked to Facebook. When I try to login the app just displays a blank screen with a tiny x in the corner. Clicking the x opens a ""Facebook credentials failed"" error. "
82,Rurda,"December 5, 2014",5,The art world on the palm of your hand This brilliant app allows you to track around the world the market for works of favorite artists. The only thing it needs is one click shopping.
83,Natalieilovehotch,"February 8, 2015",4,"Wonderful but crashes This app is amazing, i could spend hours looking through all of the artists' beautiful works. I love all the features it has, but sadly have experienced a lot of crashing while using this app :/ other than that it's great. Please fix that?"
84,CosmonautSkyler,"May 17, 2015",5,Great app for art lovers Tons of well known artists and tons of artists for art lovers to discover. Could have a little more art to show for each artist but still has plenty for your eyeballs to enjoy and your mind to think upon.
85,oo0Jo0oo,"June 19, 2015",4,"Love it but need improve. Your app is great. It's simple and beautiful. But seem that the app has got a issue relates to Sharing. I open Sharing and want to share it on my Facebook, then I close Sharing, now I can't close the keyboard. It's a minor thing and just restart. In general, still highly recommended."
86,Peeellly,"September 10, 2015",5,"If you like art, this is your app This apps awesome. I'm trying to get into art now and this is the best app to do it with. Only one problem is that I can't save the images for a wallpaper or something like that. Other than that it's great. Very good database"
87,24Ever7,"January 12, 2016",5,Very Unique App I love this app because you are able to see many pieces of art work for sale or even not for sale by many famous artists. This app also gives me inspiration for my own art work.
88,nathan3e,"May 8, 2016",5,"A magnificent art app We like everything about it, particularly the notifications about favorite artists. It is a definite must have for anyone that enjoys contemporary art on any level."
89,ltoconnell,"August 25, 2016",5,Phenomenal Such an incredible app that has afforded me so much access to what I love no matter where I am and no matter my or anyone else's income. I wish only that more people knew about this app and used it. I definitely tell people about it plenty.
90,Craig Kessler,"September 18, 2013",5,"Helpful and impressive Beautiful app. Discovered some pretty incredible, hard to find artwork thru Artsy. Seems like the ideal/efficient way to build a collection for the art enthusiasts out there."
91,Joy McNulty,"September 19, 2013",5,Art lover I downloaded this new app yesterday and as a new collector I find it very educational and of superior quality.  I look forward to checking in on my iPhone now.

93,greims123,"November 15, 2013",5,Beautiful Every time I open the app I discover something amazing. I love the subtle parallax effect when viewing a work on the wall in landscape and on the home view. Very well done!
94,Rmcmarie,"June 25, 2015",3,"So excited for a bug fix I'm an art history major and I can't tell you how excited I am for this app! But when I go to galleries, nothing shows up, and the sane thing happens on works you follow; blank. That's all I know of, but I really wish the app worked in it entirety!"
95,itaymor,"June 25, 2015",5,art like never before loved it!!!
96,reviewsrme,"April 18, 2016",5,Useful and easy art app I have tried a dozen or so art focused apps and found that Artsy is the easiest to use and has the broadest base of content to view. It is simple to follow artist or save favorite works. Good job Artsy!
97,Mr. Dish,"September 26, 2016",5,"Brilliant This is brilliant app for art lovers, curators, dealers and collectors alike. What the art world needs is transparency, and Artsy delivers it! Attention dealers: price your art. You never know who is lurking out in cyberspace with their checkbook and passion at the ready. ü§î"
98,aedixon,"November 13, 2016",5,Love! Great way to browse something besides social media. Gives leads to artists you may like because of who you follow. Can't wait to see how this develops for emerging artists.
99,morganthemoth,"July 22, 2017",5,"Window shopping + Reference Tool I dig Artsy. I'm on it several times a week. I can't really afford the art, but I love it for browsing, research, and dreaming about the art I'd love to have in my house. If I had a house."
100,Joe M 1515,"September 19, 2013",5,"New to art Engaging and fluid - it's a maze I'm happy to get lost in. There's only one (practical) way for aspiring collectors to acquire a palate for different art forms and indeed, art in general. It's become clear, this is it."
101,fancyremarker,"September 20, 2013",5,":thumbsup: Great app! I love how easy Artsy has made it to keep up with the latest shows, view new works by the artists I love, and discover artists and movements I hadn't known about before."

104,KFChildren,"October 10, 2014",4,Great way to browse and learn new things Wish it was easier to read posts and learn. Also wouldn't mind being able to set my phone's wallpaper to some of this art.
105,Mishibizhiw,"October 26, 2014",5,My Right Brain Says Thanks Great way to discover new art I would have never known about otherwise. Amazing to see how much great art is selling for in my price range!
