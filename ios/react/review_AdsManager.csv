0,SteveDolo,"December 6, 2017",1,WORST BUSINESS PLATFORM EVER Not only is the support for problem non existent & beyond generic but they don’t even try to personalize banning or solutions when they make a mistake & van the wrong person. Like they’ve banned me from paying for more ADs after I’ve already spent $200 I worked truly hard to get together as a single mother for my FB page that empowers women & is a support group that sometimes needs to use certain words like trauma or addiction simply to explain you can recover & spread hope. It needs to be case by case the trigger words. YET THERES PAGES ADVERTISING DEGRADING PHOTOS & CHILDREN IN NOTHING BUT UNDERWEAR CLAIMING ITS A KIDS LINGERIE LINE & THATS OKAY CAUSE ITS LABELED UNDER CLOTHING?! But I can’t provide a service helping women empower women & end bullying?! 
1,333enlightened1,"April 9, 2020",1,Banning people for no reason First off they banned my ads i did a review they answered back and said sorry it was a accident gave me my privileges back then 2 days later! They unpublished my page and deactivated my ads so they deny some ads ok understand but then they approved some ads then 2 days later disapprove thats so un-professional im looking into legal action as we speak facebook needs to get sued for this im building a class action and im sure im not the only one that had this problem its robbery you take peoples money they get good high percentages in there rankings you take that away without a warning literally even a email like hey make sure you change this or we will deactivate your account so we can fix it no just makes mistakes and then does it again 2 days later i have all this snap shot saved so this will hold in court you dont make a mistake then say sorry then 2 days later i do nothing different then ban us this will be addressed whoever's working that section in facebook needs to be fired making mistakes and no compensation is a big mistake
2,DanielB1997,"September 7, 2018",5,"A Good App - If You Have a Heartbeat And Half Brain I normally don’t even feel strongly about apps. But man, oh man. These reviews are pretty unfair! This is a great app for anyone who’s comfortable with basic decent graphic design, knows how to create an audience, and read metrics to improve the performance of their advertising. I’ve worked as both a part time social media manager for a nonprofit organization on a university campus, with upwards of 1.8k likes on the page being added to my tenure with the effective use of the ads and the Ads Manager. I’m now a supervisor at an authorized dealer of prepaid wireless service, and I use the app to run the promotions for a store in the Inland Empire region in California. Using the audience parameters, I’ve been able to increase our sales with very limited and strategic use of location-based advertising. It’s a good app. Keep it up!"
3,Lana DelRay,"March 18, 2020",1,"Absolutely terrible, a HUGE mistake I can’t even begin to explain the holes in the app and site. The customer service in nonexistent. Someone might send you the same automated message 2 weeks after you try to report a problem. For me, I built up an instagram profile, and then a payment went through RANDOMLY and was denied because it WAS NOT SCHEDULED and i do not keep money in that specific checking account. I tried many times to pay the .20¢, YES, TWENTY CENTS that I owed, but everything about the app glitches out. It banned me from trying to pay, and it disabled my account. I’ve reached out and gotten the same response at least 15 times. “We’re sorry... we see the issue... we’re reactivated your account.” Except my account is never actually reactivated. I’m no longer the admin of my own Facebook page, and I cannot disconnect my instagram account from the page. I’m 100% helpless to have this issue fixed. BE WARNED THIS APP IS ABSLOUTE SH**."
4,bigbillybobjr.,"November 14, 2019",2,"Confusing, unnecessarily complicated, glitchy The idea is great, but it has some usability issues. Why is it set to only Pacific time? Surely you could save the general public some trouble (and potentially costly timing mistakes) by synchronizing the app with the users time-zone. Also, your FAQs or “help center” is trash. I have an ad that i would like to duplicate but for some reason it is the only ad that cannot be duplicated. I’m sure its a good reason too, but instead of giving me a message explaining why the action cannot be made after clicking duplicate, the button simple will not work. I have tried researching why that specific ad cannot he duplicated (so i can make adjustments) but all i can find is information on how to duplicate an ad... i know how to do this, i can do it to any other ad but one specifically."

6,ByOsmosis,"October 3, 2017",1,"Where to begin... This app is predominantly useless. On multiple occasions I just put it away and waited until I could get to my computer. Lately I’ve been using it to check ad performance, but even that is abysmal, only giving the most shallow stats. And you can’t get help. Don’t bother trying. Glitches cause an ad to stop and you’re basically screwed. Build another one and hope it survives. FB ads use to be available for phone support to fix that stuff. Then it was email. Then it was messages through the help center. Now it’s nothing. I doubt they’ll even read this review. So tonight the update they pushed out went ahead and just killed the app altogether. Maybe they’re just driving the last nail into its coffin."
7,Jbarnesweb,"July 17, 2019",1,"Buggy 1. From the create ad page select the carousel pictures option and select pictures. The user interface is foreign to iPhone users. You have to select a picture in the “carousel”, then change it with a picture in the tab interface for the image source. If you change the source tab often enough it will crash."
8,GregSamek,"December 7, 2017",1,"The worst customer support Facebook seems completely disconnected from the people who actually pay this company by purchasing ads (unless you’re a VIP). Customer support is nonexistent. There is literally no contact information of any kind to use when you have a problem. It takes days to get a response through their help system and then they close your ticket before you can even confirm that they have fixed the problem. My account keeps getting locked for “unusual activity” with no explanation. My ads violate no policies and in fact get approved. If they spent one tenth of the effort on this that they do on tweaking the newsfeed for the millionth time, they would probably have a great service."
