0,MITO898,"January 1, 2020",1,"Horrible first time experience I downloaded the app to place a laundry pick up and delivery order. I placed my order and waited for the time slot for pickup. No one ever came to pick up the laundry and I received no notifications of the status. I waited 3 hours. I contacted customer support and they told me the selected merchant (the first one on the list) is outside of my pickup zone. So why was it even an option for me to select? It should have not been an option for me to select. And why did I not receive any updates? I would have been waiting all night with no updates, meanwhile my card was charged the initial holding fee which I had to get reversed after 40 mins chat with support. "
1,Ethyl Acetate,"July 9, 2018",3,"Used to be good I’m now forced to use the desktop website for all of my orders since I prefer to use PayPal. When trying to pay with PayPal using the app, it cycles through logging me into PayPal and then returning to the app to place me order. In other words, I thought I had placed an order, but never received an email or text acknowledgment, so I logged back in to check and my bag was still sitting there. I had to log into the website to finalize my order. Last complaint— although I’m not sure if it’s Delivery or restaurants but two of my favorites have inaccurate menu items and/or have claimed they never received my order. Three stars because I prefer Delivery over Seamless/Grubhub."
2,mikeyc14,"April 12, 2020",2,No cancellation notice Ordered food and received text saying would be here in an hour. After hour still no food.  Called restaurant and was told it was cancelled because the delivery was to far.  Never received a notification that it was cancelled and wasted an hour waiting for food and starving when could have ordered something else. If it was to far it should never have let me order in first place. Only good thing was they gave me 5$ credit. Still waiting to make sure I am refunded. If your going to be in delivery business as name suggests need to be better at notifying customers of cancellations so they don’t sit wasting time for an order that will never show. Should have never had to call restaurant to see what issue was.
3,djjjdjfjrrj,"September 18, 2019",1,Terrible This app is horrible all around . Maybe this is specific to my state but if you are in Missouri order food from literally ANY OTHER app . When you put in your delivery address it shows a few restaurants but if you want to do a pickup order suddenly it doesn’t service your area . How can a restaurant be close enough to deliver to you but not close enough for you to go pick up the food yourself ? Not to mention it’s extremely inaccurate. It says the majority of restaurants are closed during the day when they are definitely open or even if they do say open it still won’t let you put the order in ?? Don’t even get me started on the 15 dollar minimum for EVERY RESTAURANT. Not everyone eats that much bye .
4,Trygde,"November 9, 2019",1,"Terrible communication with restaurants I ordered something on this app due to them giving me a coupon, but once I went to pick up my order, the restaurant said they didn’t receive my order. It turns out the app called the restaurant once and they missed it, meaning my order was never alerted to them. "
5,Plaph,"August 20, 2019",3,"Great Company, not so Great Interface This company has great perks and is very responsive! I just wish their website were as responsive as the customer service. *Incredibly* slow processing when ordering groceries. I consistently wait 1-4 minutes for the page to open, and if I want to add or edit items, it takes just as long. I often give up after 90 seconds, but once, out of masochistic curiosity, I waited for 9 minutes...it was still “processing” when I logged off and ordered elsewhere. This happens on every device and search engine I use."

7,Crash571,"January 5, 2020",1,"Delivery for anytime but now? Fix your filters. This app is useless. When trying to see what is available for delivery near me, it only shows a list of everything closed now. To be clear: I’m looking at dinner on a Sunday afternoon. Not some bizarre hour when nothing is open. Any attempt to adjust filters only results in the same. There is likely a solution but frankly if you can’t be bothered to release an app that functions intuitively and properly, then I can’t be bothered to allow you a dime of my money for “using” it. (App is free. Company gets a cut of the order.) "
8,J-I-l,"April 8, 2020",1,"Horrible This is a HORRIBLE delivery service. I have no clue why it’s 5 stars. I’ve used it twice; both deliveries late and one canceled because the restaurant was closed and they didn’t let me know until a half hour AFTER the delivery was suppose to show up at my house. Mind you, I waited an hour and 15 minutes up until that point. They have horribly long wait times for delivery, incredibly unrealistic for the rural area I live in. First order was 45 minutes late after waiting an hour and 5 minutes. "
9,Rae_rae2k18,"January 10, 2020",1,"The whole thing Orders are barely made right. If you set up to have it delivered at a certain time, don’t get high hopes on it because it’s always late or way to early. Your orders get cancelled. I was waiting for an hour and 30 mins and then got a text my order was cancelled. Way to screw me out of lunch. And if you call them to complain. I hope a 5$ credit towards their next screw up is enough compensation for no lunch. Food made wrong. Late. Cold and anything else. I wish it was still just To-Go delivery and not this crap. I’ve ordered PLENTY of times here 20+ and a good 75% was wrong is some way."
