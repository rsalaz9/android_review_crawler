0,matt (noted),"May 12, 2019",4,"here’s a few suggestions when it comes to providing a convenient source of live updates to a song and it’s plays, liked, reposts, and comments. pulse provides top notch analytics that are easy to understand. however, some of soundcloud’s key components for producers are missing. an example of this would be mail between users on soundcloud. just provide another icon at the bottom of the screen that looks like mail. i can imagine this feature being programmed like regular email, or instagram DM’s providing basic reply and link functions. another issue im confused as to why it isn’t available is the option to change your photo / cover art for both your channel / page and the individual track art. most users have their photos for common use on their phone, so providing the option could mean easier access to having a better looking photo, and would save the producers or singers a lot of time, especially when on the go. "
1,subbyroots,"October 10, 2019",3,"Still has a ways to go Like others have mentioned, the concept is great but in reality it’s been lacking. For years now. I have been a user/creator since 2012. SoundCloud seems to be putting more resources into making the advertisement experience more robust and less into the creators’ corner. One of the major features that is STILL missing is you still can’t view or reply messages from either app, you need to log on to a computer for that. I can’t mention how many times I’ve missed that feature and how many times I’ve read the same generic response from SoundCloud on forums regarding that missing feature over the years. You have 2 separate apps, I get it, but put a little more focus back into the creators side of things and I think a lot more people will be happy."
2,cat66666,"July 4, 2018",1,"has soooo much potential... honestly this app cAN totally be everything that the normal soundcloud is missing but, ITS NOT. I feel like theres so many things missing such as when you simply go into editing a track, everything is available for you to edit EXCEPT the photo, its such an important element it should be easy to change but instead i have to access soundcloud on a desktop because its the ONLY way you can change the photo for a song. on the other hand it is very weird how you cant even access you followers list and need remind you that the following list is literally non-existent on the app. I feel like you guys probably have all the answers there too but are just lagggginnngggg or think no one cares about the app but it would honestly change so much. please read this I never even write reviews but just has jus bugged me for so long."
3,Natecanskate52,"June 5, 2018",4,"Needs more options but still helpful! I Started posting a bunch of stuff on SoundCloud recently and this app has been very helpful in looking at the stats, notifications, and activity on my tracks. Only things I would recommend would be to be able to change the pictures and cover photos as well as profile pic but I’m sure that will come soon. Also, in app messaging and commenting would make it much better but I like the concept of it the way it is so far. There’s some room for improvement but I would say that it’s pretty well put together as it is right now. Looking forward to updates but as of right now it’s been helpful and useful for me👌🏻👌🏻"
4,StormieSays,"August 25, 2018",3,"Good app, few suggestions. SoundCloud Pulse has a good concept, but it’s not exactly everything that it advertises. I think that Pulse users and creators should be able to edit their profile with Pulse, instead of on a computer. Another suggestion I have for the app is the ability to edit playlists like on the desktop website. I like the mechanic of being able to change playlists to albums on the website and I believe that it should be a feature included in the app. Overall it’s a great way to keep up with music stats and play counts. I would totally recommend this to another creator if/when my suggestions were implemented into the app. Keep up the good work!"
5,PissedNeverWished,"September 3, 2019",3,"I like it buuuuuut.... As with the others-no photo changes...? Or photo at all? A bit weak on this end. Completely agree with one person about needing ability to message people. I mean—it is an app—on a phone—with music to share/listen to/review/—so like social media in a way, no? Let me be able to tell another artist to keep it coming; or allow a fan to ask the track on a mix. Perhaps someone’s trying to book me-mane!!! Also it’s just good PR to be able to speak with your fellow creators and or followers. As for the profile info-sorry that bugs me. Actually so much so it got me to write this...(!) I write maybe one review for an app a year if that hahaha. Else, FR FR I dig it."
6,DICADADUBZ,"February 13, 2020",5,NEED TO EDIT ALBUM ART ON MOBILE ive been makin music and posting it exclusively for some time now but i wud like the feature to be able to change the cover art of a song through your phone on the pulse app cuz theres times where i make the art on my phone using pics art or r4ve and cant get access to a laptop and that feature to change the cover art would be sooo dope and easy to make last second changes i hope this could be possible but i love this either way
7,UconnMark,"April 12, 2019",2,What changed?? I like this app it helps me grow a fan base but right now it is displaying on pulse I have 217 followers on SoundCloud. When I check the mobile of the app and the desktop version it says I have 222. Than also when i scroll down the activity feed I get to a certain part where a user republished three songs of mins and it keeps displaying it over and over that he republished the 3. Than the app seems to start glitching and all the words disappear off the screen. Can you guys please help me so it stops crashing and displays The right number? Than I’ll rate this 5 stars because I like the app but not if it isn’t gonna work right
8,Xsliceme,"January 13, 2019",5,"Works for me! This app in my opinion works as it should. Maybe a few other things could be added that others suggest but its core is there. Music stats on your phone. If you are trying to upload music on your phone then you need to rethink some things. Upload on your pc... after all, you use a pc to make music. Why would you need to upload it on your phone? This app doesn’t need a haul of features. Its simple and does what its intended to do. Pulse has my 5 :)"
9,IXxBossxXI,"January 17, 2018",3,"Missing something important... ...messaging? 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️. It hurts to have social capability and no form of communication, that’s like holding food over a hungry baby. Give us IN app messaging and the option to view profile bios in app instead of forcing us to see full profiles on the SoundCloud app. Also please give us the ability to edit our profile information... that’s a pretty minor thing that should have been there from the start. Otherwise you’re doing a good just just keep up with the improvements"
10,MrRVC99,"June 26, 2018",5,"Great App This app is probably one of the apps I use most, I’m constantly checking as by the second I’m always getting some new listens, some new likes reposts and followers and it’s so great having an app for that rather then maybe having to check the SoundCloud app to see if your song bumped up. I will continue to use this app as long as I am making music and as long as I have music up :)"
11,Redbiddy69,"September 2, 2018",3,"Podcast Hell So I co-host a Sunday afternoon podcast called Ambigous Anthology, and we schedule on SoundCloud to have our podcast post at noon. However using pulse I set up our description for each episode and without knowing the app will unset the scheduled post time for the episodes. I realized this after weeks that editing on the app will remove the schedule of our episodes making it difficult for our followers to see our content on the regular listed time. Please fix this as soon as you can."
12,iMelJun,"September 4, 2018",1,Disappointed I was so excited to finally find an app that I can upld my songs on SoundCloud but what really ticked me off was when I was trying to sign it told me that it couldn’t find my email address in SoundCloud (which is weird to me) because I’ve been using the same email for SoundCloud for years. The annoying part of it all is when it keeps popping up saying “you sure you got the right password” every time I enter my password & I enter it again and yet it does the same thing! Instead of giving me an option it gives me the same feedback on if I have the right password 🙄 Pls! Fix this.
13,amITakingCrazyPills,"October 25, 2018",1,"Useless app Okay, so I just downloaded an app just so I can see if people are listening to the stuff I uploaded but can’t actually use the app itself to upload content? Am I confused or is this app the biggest waste of time? I’m a musician just getting started and I’m touring the country with modest means and don’t always have access to a computer I thought I was downloading an app that would actually help me get my sound out there and allow me to upload content through my phone and allow me to manage said content... is it really necessary to have an app just to see if people are listening to your music."
14,Ballorama,"December 1, 2018",3,"CAN WE PLEASE GET MESSAGING?! It’s such an important function and it’s a hassle having to check on a desktop just to see them. This would make the app so much better. Also, the app itself seems to be lacking quite a few other core features that would actually make this app more integrated. At least you can see your plays and other stats. I just feel like I don’t need a whole app just to see that and right now in its current state, that’s all this app really is. This app has so much potential!"
15,l.a. henry,"May 5, 2019",1,"To many ads I love SoundCloud been using it sense for a while an over time I’ve noticed that before there were hardly Any ads interrupting your time on the app then it changed and you would see ads more often.. now the app is playing ads like crazy, there around 30 seconds each and you can no longer skip through them i know on paper it 30 seconds doesn’t sound that bad but imagine your in a vibe an after every song there’s a 30 second ad you can’t skip through it’ll kill the vibe significantly an it’s only to get the users of the app to pay for SoundCloud plus STOP BEING GREDDY!!"
16,VaIorien,"March 2, 2020",3,"Fine App, Cannot Login, Cannot Message I got the app years ago and have enjoyed the ability to quickly respond to comments and see engagement on my tracks."
17,cherrypineapplesoda1,"August 18, 2019",3,"The Facebook Login Greetings developers! I really hope you see this and take this in mind. I am a Soundcloud user that had signed up using a facebook account and I am trying to get in using the facebook link. But there is a small problem; it wont let me. When i clicked this app open facebook the facebook link says that this app doesn't support it. Now i have an account using facebook as i said, so this would usually work. But there is something wrong. Please take this in mind! Thank you!"
18,Acent1997,"April 21, 2020",1,"Doesn’t let me log in Something is wrong this either this version or it’s compatibility on iPhone 6 running the most recent software.  I’ve reset my password and am sure my login info is correct, yet it tells me there has been an error no matter how many times I re download the app.  The app doesn’t show up in my settings, so common fixes such as clearing the cache aren’t an option.  Please fix this, as I’ve used the app before and love it.  Also, there is no customer support for SoundCloud other than FAQs and common fixes.  It’d be great to have a phone line available for simple stuff like this."
19,Zarb Ebner,"October 7, 2019",2,"Doesn’t Show Important Stats Even as a paying Pro Unlimited user, having uploaded over 400 songs (DESKPOP), I can’t even edit my albums/EPs/playlists from this, which can be extremely crucial on launch day for a release with more than 1 song. I ask for that, and the ability to filter notifications by type (specifically to see all recent comments (plus maybe the ability to reply to them)). I’m glad I can edit song descriptions, but I wish people listening on mobile had the ability read them..."
20,Thisisart,"December 21, 2017",3,"Thanks Now with this app, I can see that my ex girlfriend and my little cousin are among my biggest listeners and I should probably hit them up and let them know how much I appreciate them <3 so... where’s the messaging feature on the app? Jk ;)"
21,aay brolio,"December 26, 2017",1,"The most useless app I’ve ever downloaded I downloaded this app in hopes of being able to change my url and upload music, yet it does neither. The only device I have to work with is my phone, since I can not afford a computer or your ridiculous ‘SoundCloud Go’, so I can’t access the desktop website. Why create this app when it’s completely useless to everyone except those who have already made a ton of money on this app by repeating the same two words over and over, and immobilizing most beginning creators?"
22,CaliKnox,"March 4, 2018",2,"Messaging? Please, give us messaging on the app. With SoundCloud charging users on both ends (they charge both listeners and creators) you’d think they could make the app have THE ONE THING that sets it apart from other music sharing platforms which is the social capabilities of SoundCloud. Love the platform and possibilities it provides up and coming musicians, but it won’t be around much longer with this business model. Please give us messaging on the app and change your business model. "
23,JeromeBetta,"April 16, 2018",4,"this app is great and simple but, this app is simple to use, easy to navigate and all but it would be nice if it had the soundcloud direct message option like on a computer. and maybe im getting ahead of myself but maybe when ever your song has been played multiple times by a person you get a notification saying “____ has played your track ‘__’ 4 Consecutive times!”"
24,P zillion,"September 1, 2018",4,"Add Photo Edit please It will be very important because, right now I’m just stuck somewhere and wait until I get home tonight to make a change on one of my music poster and I thought the app was able to do that until right now that I just find out that it couldn’t do it"
25,Zachariahaha,"October 17, 2018",4,Refreshing improvements The improvements you all have made to this app have not gone unnoticed. The ability to share private tracks straight from the app is one of my favorite updates. Happy to see this app become more user friendly. I still occasionally experience crashes when I edit a playlist in the app though.
26,Urso1937,"March 12, 2019",1,"Update the user interface and make profile editing simple This is poorly thought out, I have no ability to edit profile name nor photos for albums. I have no ability to do this over a phone browser, nor does it clearly state any of this. Take some of the advertisement money and put it into hiring a new U.I. manager and a couple of hungry coders. This is a serious hassle when you have new musicians who'd rather be making 🎶 than writing reviews. I appreciate the hard work but this app and the entire UI needs to be seriously rethought. Good luck🤙🏽"
27,Zolnoor,"May 7, 2019",3,"I am a mobile app developer who never writes reviews I’ve worked on one of the biggest apps in this store... Why in the world is this separate from the original app? Hell you could have had a modal webview popup within the original app just showing stats. There is zero reason for this to be separated. Whoever is planning your products, consider their decisions."
28,Music is life...,"January 13, 2020",5,"Great family fun! I let my kids play on my phone when I am working, I have plenty of games installed but they always seem to love this one the most! Every time my second oldest Henry gets home after school he comes running up stairs yelling “Mommy! Let me play SoundCloud Pulse!!” It’s so cute, I have yet to play the game myself but my kids enjoy it so much it must not be lacking."
29,Anonymous 3126,"January 4, 2020",5,"Honest Five Stars As a creator who started this year, pulse is so easy to comprehend and understand. It has a simplistic view and such easy analytics to understand. I feel like it could be improved by somehow having a way to publish tracks on mobile. Nevertheless, it is a great app and if you are a creator you should definitely install this."
30,spaceship_captain,"September 29, 2017",1,"This abosolutely makes no sense! I find it stupid, how you have a app dedicated to doing things that the regular SoundCloud app can't do, but we still cant change our profile or cover photo, we still can't change the name of our url, and we still arent able to change our location. I dont understand why all that is so hard to incorporate in one app. Why not make the mobile app as good as the website. Im pretty there just as much (if not, more) people using using the app rather than using the website."
31,Verxendii,"April 3, 2018",4,Huge feature suggestion The ultimate feature would be if you could upload tracks from Files or Dropbox. I would love to upload tracks from my phone simply because I don’t always want to use my computer. Other than that I love the app.
32,evilbassist99,"April 23, 2018",2,"Numbers broke! I’m a big fan of what you guys are doing at SoundCloud and I love your platform, but Pulse recently stopped counting my plays and only shows the correct numbers if you click on the individual songs. The total count is wrong, and on the actual menu of songs to select it also is incorrect. However, if I go into each song’s in-depth menu I can clearly see the correct numbers, and I can see the correct numbers on SoundCloud itself as well. Please help!"
33,chrisgonz605,"June 3, 2018",5,"DM Feature Please! If I could private message producers and other people that would be fantastic. Sometimes their only communication is SoundCloud and that would help us a lot. Other than that, I really like the app. Keep up the good work!"
34,Lazertazer718,"October 27, 2018",5,Please FIX love this app But please let us change our profile pictures on IOS mobile devices and Let us Change the Song pictures as well. Please let us Also See who played our songs. Thank you so much.
35,zenrocks,"February 6, 2019",2,Needs work Due to glitches this app has locked me out of my account and I can’t even open it to use it. I like the idea of this app because you purchase individual tracks and sessions rather than paying a subscription fee like a lot of other apps want you to. However the tracks do seem a little overpriced considering that you can pay up to $10 for a single one and there are hundreds and most of the free ones are not that fantastic
36,jt Kulak,"January 12, 2020",4,"Great but a bit bright I love this app and it works very smoothly. I can see all my stats clearly and that is fine. However i noticed the SoundCloud app recently joined the dark side and I was really hoping Pulse would join it. However, I was mistaken. If you could bring dark mode to the app it would get five stars. Again, love the app, but I also like my screen darker."
37,Carl from carl,"April 8, 2020",2,"Ok app, but still no dm access after all these years Over time this app has not been updated. Seriously, we are still unable to access are direct messages. That is a very important part of making music. How will we know if someone messaged us? We won’t unless we get on the computer and a lot of us don’t have a computer around us all the time. Add this feature to the app plz. This feature should had been added years ago."
38,-Maroo,"January 20, 2020",2,Broken! Soundcloud has been such a good platform to grow not only as an artist but also as a person who loves music and discovering new music. The app had been so good to me until my stats showed I was getting 0 likes in the last 7 days. That was not true it showed in the notifications that people were liking my music but it showed on the chart as 0 likes. Also my notifications don’t work on desktop version.
39,jxn / JBoozer,"August 5, 2019",3,"Here's a suggestion: The app is pretty well laid out for when I need to catch up on stats and replies. My only concern is that it never asked me for turning notifications on, let's say, for if someone replied to you or your weekly update on stats overall. That would make this app so much more enjoyable and helpful. Without it, it just doesn't seem like what it should be."
40,colonelmorris,"September 4, 2017",3,"solid but missing key elements!?!?! pulse is essential for any artist on soundcloud however it lacks key elements available on the soundcloud website like messages and more in depth stats, among many others. please work on getting the app all the capabilities that the website has, i don't understand why it should be limited. "
41,Mdivrulz,"February 3, 2018",4,Useful but missing 1 important feature I wish you were able to check your private messages through the app. I have to go on the computer to see them and having in app access would make it so much easier
42,dillpickles416,"February 17, 2018",1,"The app does nothing ive been trying to set up my account for like an hour. I do not have access to a computer or desktop device. I want to be able to 1. be able to edit my account from mobile, which is not an unreasonable thing to ask, and 2. nothing really i only meed to do this one thing and soundcloud will not let me do it, im very close to finding another platform to use if i cant figure this stupid soundcloud out"
43,SlayerIsTheMayor,"August 3, 2018",4,"Needs one thing I love the app, so far so good. The only thing is I wish I could edit my profile from pulse, like your bio, profile pic, name, etc. because for some reason I can’t do it on the SoundCloud app itself. That would be great if you added a profile editing feature"
44,Ransack Bill,"August 19, 2018",3,"Pretty great, could be better I want to be able to edit my track picture and profile pic from here, it’s a hassle to just go on my computer and log in, just to be able to do this. It’s great for what you’re able to do, but it could be even better with these added features."
45,baka.,"January 17, 2019",4,I love this app but.... As a frequent user of SoundCloud I feel the mobile app should grant the user more customization features. It’s really hard for those on mobile such as my self to tend to my page needs with no laptop at my disposal. Just a thought tho 🤷🏾‍♂️
46,Just in Kace OG,"March 28, 2019",1,"What’s the Point??? I downloaded this app so I would be able to interact with my followers and edit my page. This app does neither of those things. I can see insights, but if I want to thank someone for following me or liking a track I am unable to do so. Furthermore, I cannot edit the photo on a track nor edit any of the information. This app is pointless. I do not care about insights. I care about my music and interacting with my fans. Fix!!!"
47,Johnny Galaxies,"August 20, 2019",2,Inaccurate It says I have three likes when I have around twenty something. Same thing with the listens I have nearly 5OO and it says I have 358. It worked for two days and was very useful. I would appreciate if you could fix that. I’m losing views and likes on some days too?? Like I had 13 and it dropped to 5 when I checked my account I still had 2O something. :(
48,TaraBach,"December 18, 2019",3,"I like this app but its lacking a bit I love having access to stats, but I wish it were a bit more interactive. It would also be a huge plus to access soundcloud messages on this mobile app instead of solely desktop. "
49,Auntie Bucky,"October 22, 2019",3,"Ok... but give me DM’s!! It’s alright, not too different from regular SoundCloud in my opinion. But both apps lack one key thing- I cant view direct messages from people! And since they won’t let you go on the website on your phone it’s even more inconvenient. Please make this a feature in a future update."
50,:Devin!,"October 14, 2017",5,FINNALY!! I am so glad you guys did this. I don't give a crap what everyone else says because if you aren't trying to manage your SoundCloud a count ( as a music producer) then it's pointless. 
51,Nuclear Knight,"April 29, 2018",2,Shouldn’t be separate I say you should combine SoundCloud with Pulse.
52,Xris905,"July 24, 2018",2,"No Real Control You are able to edit most info for tracks, but one of the most important things, being artwork, is simply just not accessible through this app or the basic Soundcloud app. This is such a simple thing to implement and I’m surprised it’s been this long with no sign of any ability to add artwork to tracks. Disappointed."
53,omgroseii,"August 22, 2018",4,Ok app but missing a nice feature Pulse is a fine app just to check your stats on the go but I feel like the app is missing the message feature like on the website
54,SIM PLAYER 777BJ,"October 25, 2018",4,"Idea. I have a idea for this app. It would be awesome if you could upload music through the app. And let it be able to upload through google drive, and files. Thank you for reading. Please consider."
55,Farmvill fan,"December 6, 2018",2,Oh the potential The whole thing is app based so by that I would think one would be able to access the features threw the app itself. To delete a song or edit the picture you need to log on to a desk top device. Not even a mobile browser will work....sigh this seem to be an easy fix..
56,PodKiller0410,"May 2, 2019",3,"It’s alright I get my stats, my plays per week (or any time period) and I get notifications, but there’s more things this app should be able to do. Messages is a big thing for me, so I look forward to seeing messages being implemented into a new app or this one soon"
57,tr3y2890,"November 9, 2019",4,It’s does what you can’t do on the mobile SoundCloud I mean I like that I can change the photos of my songs I post and information! It would be super cool if you could search other artist through this though.
58,djnobody,"August 24, 2019",3,Need to be able to upload from App I make my music on my phone (most of the time) since I am a ghostwriter for EDM/house/etc.  I don’t mix down or master my tracks. Having to get on a desktop every time I need to upload is a hassle. Will recommend once this is a feature.
59,bbfire55,"August 5, 2019",4,"Dark mode please I often find myself on my phone at night checking up on my plays. If the app developers would add a dark mode, I’m sure that would help me greatly and many others as well. Thank you :)6"
60,Zephretheus,"August 3, 2017",3,This app is functional. All of this should have been added to the SoundCloud app. Makes it really unnecessary and inefficient to have to switch between apps to access your songs and then your comments. This is unacceptable coming from a company such as SoundCloud.
61,somedudenamedionix,"December 11, 2017",4,"Good, but lacks a critical feature. Overall this app is extremely useful for keeping track of things, but the lack of message support is very disappointing."
62,Than Dunn,"December 12, 2017",4,Great but has one issue It’s a very minor problem that really isn’t an actual issue but you should be able to send and receive SoundCloud messages in the app
63,Drizzy Gambino,"February 24, 2018",4,Who are my viewers If it says i have like 45 listens on a certain day it might show me 6 listeners where the total listens equal up to 30 listens. Also add something so i can see which users are listening to each song individually
64,Bib ak47,"March 12, 2018",5,Settings I’m glad I can see my stats but I wish I could edit my profile and change my profile picture
65,hź.ÇłøçkO0,"June 18, 2018",1,............... I had the app for at least a few minutes to analyze it to see if the people were right.
66,Nanileigh,"January 30, 2019",5,Awesome This is awesome but I really think you should add notifications every time you get a follower or a like or something like that. That would really improve the app
67,Kamikø~Chan,"March 27, 2019",1,"Not really useful 😕 To be honest, when I saw this app I thought it would help update your profile because that is the whole reason why I downloaded it. There’s really nothing to it, it’s just notifications and other stuff. Please don’t get mad at me (this is just an opinion) I think it would be better if you could edit your profile on this app."
68,JKTouchdown,"April 20, 2019",3,Should do more This app does not allow you to edit artwork or your track on your page. It does give insightful statistics of your music and provides the ability to keep up with fans but that’s it.

70,MadiStarlight,"September 18, 2017",1,"Thought I would at least be able to upload Can't even figure out how to upload recordings to this. Then I thought, maybe I have to go to my recording app and ""share"" it with SoundCloud. Nope. App is seriously lacking, and it's not really worth the extra three features from the other SoundCloud app."
71,🥀Dat_Gurl_Bef🥀,"January 17, 2018",5,I mean... I mean I just wish there was a way you could upload music to sound cloud from your phone!!
72,Kingkirklin13,"April 20, 2018",4,"I want to DELETE my tracks The only reason I give this app a 4/5 is because I’d like the ability to delete tracks, not just make them public or private"
73,nvctve,"August 7, 2018",4,"Needs messaging This app is cool and all. I can see who liked my tracks and see who followed me on the go, but can you please just add a messaging feature to this app so I can respond to SoundCloud DMs on my phone?"
74,zhongboi,"September 2, 2018",2,"No profile pic??? This is my first review I’ve ever written and all I have to say is that this app could be a lot more useful. It’s cool to see your daily listeners and averages but you can’t even change your profile pic? Please add this feature, every other social media app has this simple function."

250,shiny baubles,"May 2, 2016",1,"Awful Design and Unintuitive Functionality. To start off: you cannot see who is downloading, playing, or sharing your tracks after notification. There are practically no analytics with terrible graphs that are meaningless fluff for your weekly plays. You cannot reply at a specific time at the song, merely you can reply to the original poster. This app only shows the simple analytics and you have no idea where your users are coming from. The original soundcloud app that allowed comment sharing and communication functions used to function better than this as all the app seems to do is tell you weekly/monthly counts and total plays on all songs. It is a husk of the communication and analytic tab on the website and serves no purpose as I would rather open up my laptop and go to my actual account than use this piece of actual garbage. I literally can't even send messages to other artists or if I can, the app is so unintuitive that I can not find the section for messaging artists other than replying to comments on tracks. Again, to reiterate, this app has almost no functionality considering the original soundcloud app featured all the content included minus the analytics and even more functionality than both this and the new soundcloud app combined. If you're an artist on soundcloud that pays for this service, don't even bother downloading this app as it's borderline useless."

261,Incendium the fox,"February 24, 2016",5,"Loving it This app is not only a satisfying and useful tool for creators who monitor the stats of their tracks extensively. It's something I (and most likely many others) have been waiting for, and while there are a few features that could be added on to make this an even more powerful tool, it's still a wonderful idea, and in my opinion it was executed perfectly, all while upholding soundcloud's slick and visually appealing style. "
262,<V()LT>,"February 25, 2016",3,"Useful but could be better Its great that I could finally check for notifications on my phone but it is still quite limiting compared to the desktop version. To make it better, I suggest adding a message inbox and an ability to see who liked, reposted, and commented on individual tracks as well as seeing the comments on certain tracks. Giving the ability to edit your uploaded tracks would be nice as well however, don't say that this app gives you the ability to upload tracks. I don't think it is possible to upload tracks to soundcloud on iPhones unless this app is integrated to other apps that you could make music on like Garageband."
263,desyny,"February 26, 2016",3,"I have some thoughts... As an avid creator based on soundcloud I feel like this is way overdue. I thought it was the same thing as the normal soundcloud app but with notifications and stats. However, I can't play any songs on it which makes it really annoying. I hate the fact that I can't do that but I love the fact that I can finally see my notifications, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. I would recommend adding song playability into the app, but hell, if you're gonna do that you might as well just put it in the original app. Maybe just add notifications and stats into the 'More' section in the 'Collection' tab and show comments and show who likes on all tracks by maybe scrolling when you are viewing a track. This would be a convenient and reasonable compromise for both creators who absolutely revolve around soundcloud like myself and people who just want to listen to some music for a little bit."
264,Hdbcgcfhxjbgj,"April 28, 2016",3,"Great app with some necessary improvements I'm very happy this app has been created. As a Podcaster, I love being able to review my stats on a separate app. However, I feel the stats shown on this app should reflect the format of the stats you are able to view on the SoundCloud website. In addition to being able to see how many plays I got, I would like to see what tracks were played. I'd also like to see the stats of a specific episode when I select it as being able to set a specific time frame rather than only being given the four options of 7 days 14 days 30 days and all time. I would also like the option to chose what I'm looking at when I first open the app. I personally don't look at notifications, I focus on stats. This isn't a big problem but it's a thought I had none the less. My last Improvment would be adopting the ability to see who listened to how many episodes. Similar to the SoundCloud stats function. Again I am very grateful for this app it's really convenient, and in exited to see improvements with the next update."
265,Reed😉,"August 8, 2016",2,"Times incorrect The time is messed up for everything. For my yearly plays, the plays ive gotten this year is labeled ""2015"" the months are also one month behind. Also the daily plays don't reset at midnight, so there should be something to fix that. I have a pro account and the app wont let me look where people are listening from. Also i'd like a feature to edit my track. The app could be so good, but really guys? Ive had this for a few months, and its kind of a waste. Like if you're going to spend all this time making an app for producers, could you at least make it helpful and accurate. My plays arent even the same on this app and from my computer"
266,A Heavy Thinker,"November 18, 2016",1,Unsatisfied Customer The app seem like a good idea because as a faithful SoundCloud user and account holder I loved the idea of being able to edit post and change things on my account and read messages comment back and everything while on the go! Beautiful idea! I'm Upset about for the simple fact this use to be free a year or to ago but then you took away and know your charging for it... fine! So me thinking this was a great idea I purchased it no 7 day trail or nothing troubling g SoundCloud has It stuff together. Now that I have purchased it the app doesn't even work...I can't edit or anything all it does it load forever then crash. I've deleted and reinstalled I've cut my phone off and cut it back on I've tried it on my ipad brand new might I add and I have an iPhone 7 fully loaded and capable of handling all challenges and in top of that they are hooked up to 250 Mbps of wifi so I know it's not a problem On my side... I JUT WANT MY MONEY AND UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED PPL SHOULD GET A 7 DAY TRAIL BEFORE YOU MAKE PPL PAY $8.49 for an app that all the bugs are not out of... thank you In advice
267,Fellow brutha in Christ,"November 20, 2016",5,"A little problem I'm not yet able to use the edit feature on my newest posts to SoundCloud. When I go to edit i just see a blank screen and it just buffers and nothing happens. Then when i exit then try again the whole app just kicks me off. A few days ago I used AudioCopy to upload my music and when I do that for some reason it automatically allows anyone to download my music so I was counting on Pulse to allow me to quickly change that but unfortunately I can't get into edit mode cause it doesn't work, it only works on my older post and today I noticed someone downloaded my music that I recently posted. Please fix this issue soon. I appreciate what you have done so far. Thanks."
268,hermitnerd,"December 30, 2016",2,"Need to be able to LISTEN to tracks in Pulse It's like SoundCloud management have never heard the term User Centered Design. We the music ""creators"" have been waiting for this ever since Soundcloud's terrible decision to completely revamp their mobile apps, catering only to those who listen. Now, with Pulse we are able to see basic statistics and comments to our tracks, and are able to respond to those comments. What sound cloud management still doesn't seem to understand, is that we are using SoundCloud as a vibrant music based social medium, on the go. Sound cloud is missing a huge opportunity by having pulse and the main Soundcloud mobile app separate, and we are still not able to leave comments on the mobile versions. Also Soundcloud doesn't seem to understand that we the creators actually listen to our own tracks. A lot. Please add the ability to play a track you are viewing in pulse"

271,SunYehoshua,"February 24, 2016",1,"Weak Was hoping for more. The ability to view your notifications (and reply to some comments) definitely is a plus, but that's about all this app offers. The original soundcloud app (before they made those horrible updates) was 10 times better than this. You cannot play any music from this app, or view comments on anyone's song. If they simply added a ""creator"" option into the other soundcloud app, they could have brought back a lot of people that uninstalled after they made those updates, thus knocking out 2 birds with one stone. Oh well, wishful thinking I suppose. 1 Star"
272,darrenlinglee,"February 24, 2016",4,"has potential this app is a step up from the default soundcloud app for creators, now offering stats, notifications, and FINALLY the ability to share links from private tracks on mobile. however, it feels lacking and is basically the bare minimum of what should already have been integrated. it could use some new features to make a different and unique experience, as an app should. but for now, it's enough"
273,Basheer Anani,"February 25, 2016",2,"A Hassle The positive take is that this app aligns with Soundcloud’s focus on creators, whereas the original gave nothing for creators—no editing or social options."
274,"Poomasta5,000","March 3, 2016",3,This is how it could be better... Let you send and receive messages. And have the option to add a track in the messenger that can be listened to within the app. I like to send out ideas to other artists that I'm working with but can't listen to them until I'm in front of my computer screen. The only way we can share ideas is through Google docs... I don't even want to get started explaining how awful that is. 
275,isaacstinson,"August 14, 2016",3,"Much Needed, but... It's a huge step up from nothing, but it's still lacking a lot of things. The stats page is pretty weak, the whole ""stats overview"" page needs to be integrated rather than a watered down version. It's frustrating only seeing stars for three songs up at a time, as well as only seeing the splits overall rather than a daily breakdown of ratios of plays. Basically, integrate the entire stats function plus messaging and I would be happy with it"

I've needed mobile notifications for a whileeee now I'm excited about that but I don't see why you couldn't of just added it to the original app. It's not like non creators will get overwhelmed at the sight of a notification, in my opinion this just makes things harder to have two separate apps"

It is stupid that we can't listen to music from other artists at the same time as we are checking our notifications and editing our uploads. Why must you punish us, what did we ever do to you? Every time I open a SoundCloud app there is something new I discover that I cannot do that I could do on the desktop version. Why?"
288,FrankRay of Milwaukee,"January 22, 2017",1,"Can't comment on tracks You can't write comments on tracks from your phone, but you can reply to them. Music is social and SoundCloud creators purposely omit this feature for some reason. Probably so more people listen to SoundCloud from their computer, because that is the only way you can leave a comment. I think I speak for everyone when most people listen to music on the go, and would like to be able to comment and reply on the go. SoundCloud would be every music creators favorite site if this feature was added."
289,M.A.B.,"April 26, 2017",1,Agreeing with all the negative comments Everyone else has pretty much already said it. The fact that this is even a standalone app is kind of sad. How hard would it be to just have this entire app as one tab in the SoundCloud app? And I have to completely agree with everyone else saying that it's BS that you can't comment other people's tracks. What's the point in being able to reply to a comment on a track if people can't even comment on it? It's kinda mind boggling that took away this ability and still haven't brought it back.

No metadata editing capabilities, and you can't even play your own songs. All I want is the functionality of the desktop website. How is it that I now have two apps on my phone, but I still can't make full use of my accounts? Try harder, SoundCloud."
312,IAmMeh,"February 25, 2016",4,"Could use improvement; good for now The app is okay, I just have two main issues. One: why not integrate it into one app? And two: Have a section for replying to messages, that would be very useful."
313,pthomasz,"March 20, 2016",2,"More Stats. I'm definitely glad to finally see my notifications as a content creator. The stats page needs work though. It's not very useful to only see top tracks. I pay for pro on my desktop account but since the mobile browsers redirect to the app, I can't check those stats anywhere else."
314,Dimik1,"April 27, 2016",3,"Still missing some important features It's great that now the producers are able to manage the stats and the comments to their tracks, but the app would gain tons of usability if it had messaging center and multiple accounts feature. Thanks!"
315,rigo upton,"June 24, 2016",3,"MESSAGING & PROFILE EDIT I've been waiting for the Soundcloud app to be more accessible for users who are posting content so I'm glad to see Soundcloud finally making progress! Although, I think messaging would be a very useful asset to this app along with profile customization."
316,Prince_Faustino,"November 27, 2016",5,SoundCloud plus Love the app!! Makes everything a lot easier when you wanna check comments and etc💯
317,XavierCMoore,"January 26, 2017",5,Finally I've been having to turn on my computer but now it's extra convenient
318,Genonious Jordan,"February 2, 2017",2,"Please listen The original SoundCloud app needs the ""delete"" function as a button. Some of us iPhone users make music with only iPhones. It's also impossible to change the name of a song, and check comments and other simple things that you can only check on the computer."
319,Marzilla990,"March 29, 2017",4,"It's great, but... I can't delete tracks, and I can't change the background picture of a song I've uploaded. I like using pulse for adding tags to what i've made from my phone after uploading it, not a bad app."
320,Lowtemp404a,"February 24, 2016",3,Okay!?! Why did SC remove the ability to do everything this app does in the first place? Only to appear in a separate app??
321,Beanie blan,"February 25, 2016",3,Almost there Need a feature to upload songs from email or something that's the main thing artist need is a upload feature through our phones what's the use of a iPhone when u can't use it for the best potential lol fr
322,Enuf86,"March 15, 2016",4,"Cool Pretty cool app if you the kind of person who want to keep up with such things. I would've gave it a 5 if you could access your likes, messages, etc. from the ""Track"" screen"
323,Ipoddo20,"March 31, 2016",4,Pretty good I love everything about it. I would like to be able to play my own music from the app and be able to respond to comments and such from the app tho <33
324,Man likes books,"April 11, 2016",3,"Some Ideas I like how I'm able to see my notifications because I don't own a computer. However, it'll be really useful to add a message function to read messages and/or mail from other users. "
325,KngtRdr,"April 16, 2016",2,"Ugh. Pretty terrible user experience. Ao many ""creator"" features that just aren't included. Oh, and now the ""Tracks"" listing doesn't even work. The ONE reason to have this app; being able to listen to your own private tracks, is broken. Stay away until they actually put more effort into it."
326,Jaimzterr,"June 29, 2016",3,"Needs work I can no longer ""View Profile on Soundcloud"" because it now sends me to safari. I used to be able to open through the app itself. Should also be able to edit!!!"
327,Leveni,"August 28, 2016",3,"Good NOT Great I love being able to see stats and comments, but those are not the only features needed as an artist. App is missing the message capability and being able to edit the appearance of profile- specifically profile pic/header."
328,VoltexMeda,"November 17, 2016",4,"More Utilities It's pretty good, but u feel the most annoying thing is that I can edit information on a track without being on the computer."
329,KiLo2CaLi,"May 19, 2017",4,Wish this app had SoundCloud Messages Love using this app to see what's going on with my page. Just this app would be that much more recommendable if you added this feature
330,Will rulez,"February 28, 2016",3,"It's fine for what it is. It does its job. My main question is why can't you just implement this into the actual app? Like seriously. OR, change it back to how it USED to be over a year and a half ago. That would be lovely too."
331,MichaelM524,"February 29, 2016",1,"Seriously? I'm still waiting for the ability, on one of the two apps you have, to check messages. I can't believe that neither has the ability to. Essentially, if you can't get to a desktop version, they're useless. They just tell you when someone plays a song or comments/likes."
332,Peterpoebeats,"May 7, 2016",5,"Exactly what I was looking for I hate how on mobile I couldn't see who liked/commented, I finally found this and it works great"
333,sleezy_ytn,"May 28, 2016",5,"I downloaded because of the neg reviews 🤔 App works perfect if you don't have an ancient phone (I'm guessing). Terrific app, simplistic interface & does as it says 5 stars!"
334,Tnanmusic,"October 6, 2016",2,"Literally doesn't accomplish anything useful The app is very, very weak at the moment. "
335,thom4212,"November 19, 2016",5,Awesome It's super nice to finally be able to keep up with stats and notifications without a laptop.
336,Fairo.,"November 26, 2016",4,"Good, but could improve Glad an app like this exists. A lot more integration of what is possible on a desktop could be on pulse. Overall necessary for artists, but has room to grow."
337,ColeNF,"January 24, 2017",3,"Good idea but needs more features This is what we've been  needing from soundcloud, but it lacks features. I want to be able to do more with this app, almost as much as I can on the website"
338,kwdubs,"February 25, 2017",3,"Incredibly Limited Given the Potential This really should be the app that adds on the social components that SoundCloud has on the browsers that are lacking on the iOS app. You should be allowed to view followers, followees, add comments, etc. EVERYONE HAS BEEN ASKING FOR THIS"
339,ChaosDropps,"August 29, 2017",3,More Options There should be an option to delete a track and an option to change a track's cover art.
340,bahramahmady,"February 24, 2016",4,long overdue Took way too long for them to make this but I'm thankful it's finally here. Can't wait to see how this grows and what features they start adding.
341,$LUMLORD,"February 24, 2016",3,"Could be better , but something better than nothing Title says it all , much more could be added but thankful the little they did add is here can't wait for the future of this app"
342,coutrim,"February 25, 2016",5,"Finaly❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Finaly soundcloud release it, something for us to manage out account away from the computer, loving it"
343,Luciiid,"February 25, 2016",3,"Alright . Needs the ability to share your song to groups and also.. Why not make it like the original app where you can play music too.. Other than that, it's alright ..."
344,Yowlzheimer,"February 26, 2016",3,"Decent but.. I really wish you could change your profile picture from this app, and just edit your profile in general. Not everybody has a pc to do that"
345,MeanOuija,"March 11, 2016",4,Add a few changes Edit/Add lyrics 
346,Envy Meh,"April 21, 2016",3,Great app but needs more features You should have the option to be able to see who likes/retweets your music even if you weren't the one who posted it originally
347,Diflix,"February 7, 2017",4,Decent but needs work This is the first step. I bet that it will become exponentially better in the coming months.
348,Gooooooooooaaaaaallll!!!!!!!,"June 17, 2017",5,Great stuff The app comes in handy while on the go. Don't have to always rely on my laptop.
349,Ed Bloc,"June 19, 2017",1,"Cannot upload One cannot upload to this app, meaning it is just a way to organize what is uploaded elsewhere and track plays, etc. If you want to put music on SoundCloud, this will not do it. FYI, the process to 1) get the app, 2) create an account and 3) try to upload, took a long time. It was all for nothing. Rock n roll"
350,shannonslatermu,"February 24, 2016",4,"Finally! It's a bit buggy, but it's a HUGE step in the right direction. This is what we've needed for a while. Thank you soundcloud"
351,Vertigo One,"February 25, 2016",2,"Please reboot the original app! Great... Now there are two subpar apps, neither of which are an improvement to how it used to function on iOS.  I guess there is no replacing an actual desktop computer to get the most out of the experience?"
352,Ace Summers,"February 27, 2016",3,"Missing Messages There's no personal messaging in this app, I'm not sure how difficult it would be to add this feature but it drives me nuts that I have to use my desktop to access it!"
353,MrcoEx,"April 16, 2016",3,"Good but could use some work First This app is good for the first days but as the listeners increase the data becomes inaccurate. Lastly, the likes doesn't keep up with REAL number of likes the official sound cloud app presents."
354,DJ Kenneth A,"May 3, 2016",2,Needs more Latest update makes the app crash as soon as it opens on iPhone 6. Also it really needs a messaging feature. Stats are fine but not as robust as on the actual website
355,Thurmon Meownson,"May 5, 2016",3,#bieber Bottom of settings page has a #bieber. Not sold....
356,JamesYOoooo,"November 22, 2016",2,"Needs serious work The new edit feature crashes the app when attempting to edit new tracks.  Still very glitchy, get stuck loading sometimes.  Overall, it needs work."
357,morrs20,"December 27, 2016",3,Upload feature would be key Key to enjoying this app would be an upload feature
358,Ashiromusic,"February 2, 2017",4,"Almost perfect! I just wish you could manage your messages on the app, but other than that it's awesome and such a great tool!"
359,1309804,"March 2, 2017",4,Seems to work well Would be very nice if I could respond to messages through this as well
360,ChanceRoger,"February 24, 2016",3,Privacy settings for tracks would be nice The option to delete a song or make it private on a smartphone will make the app 120x better.
361,Angel dustrock,"February 24, 2016",1,"GARBAGE Why couldn't you have these features in the original app, at least the comment section, I remember one time while you streamed on a mobile device you can see the users default picture who commented on the song as how you do from a desktop"
362,2wefdefrg5,"February 24, 2016",1,"Too little , Too late Come on soundcloud. First you strip the original app , now you split it . All this and still many major features are still missing. It's absolutely pathetic for a site of this stature and revenue flow to have such weak apps. No excuse soundcloud you're letting us all down."
363,runslow walker,"February 25, 2016",5,Yep this is close to what I had in mind when I complained about the main app. well done and thankyou!
364,Dude guy 3,"March 14, 2016",2,"Bland Play counts sometimes drop in count which leads me to believe they're not the real count. The plays on the website are different than what's displayed in the app? It's pretty lackluster. The soundcloud app is already bad as it is, this secondary app, (which is a dumb idea already) reflects that."
365,Kiwi the khris man,"May 30, 2016",4,Good but needs message feature I like the app but I can't message anyone could you guys add a message feature??
366,Get swole 35,"June 6, 2016",2,We need to be able to Edit our profile We need to be able to change cover art for music and hashtags titles and everything
367,BlueOpsCommical,"November 16, 2016",3,Won't load edit tracks The point of the app is to edit tracks and it won't load that feature...
368,Underrated68,"March 7, 2017",3,"NEEDS MORE ACCOUNT MANAGMENT As an artist, I am looking to be able to update my account frequently by deleting tracks, changing profile pictures, changing track artwork, etc on the mobile app."
369,Poet13,"June 18, 2017",1,Total crap SoundCloud could actually put some genuine effort into utilizing current smartphone technology to create a producer app that has a LOT more functionality and an intuitive interface. It's lame enough that songs don't update properly in both apps but they're not on their game.
370,Joshua.Krikorian,"February 24, 2016",3,"Step in the right direction . Please allow us to edit our profile . ( profile picture , bios etc. ) But this is a good upgrade ."
371,Asivstah,"August 10, 2016",4,NEEDS MESSAGING I like this app really good cuz i could check my music and everything but all is missing is the messaging for soundcloud thats IT !!!
372,Entaiyogurt,"August 25, 2016",3,"I guess The app is alright to see numbers, but implementing options to change profile pictures, urls, etc. is much needed."

374,Eli Way,"October 26, 2016",2,"Shouldn't be an app honestly With the amount of features this app offers, it should just be part of the official SoundCloud app, and not entirely separate. It's basically just a way to check notifications."
375,Potheadkid,"November 15, 2016",5,Awesome!! I wasn't going to write a review but the latest update is really beneficial to us artist ! Thanks !
376,SoundCloud.com/zionspeaks,"November 16, 2016",5,This app helped me so much! Made replying to comments so easy! Love what they are doing.
377,Ritzcraca,"November 17, 2016",3,Finally! I like the app but you need to be able to edit your profile so people can have more use for the app.
378,hermmyx,"March 11, 2017",3,Need Messages Great app but would be even better with the ability to respond to private messages.
379,Owlsnot,"March 29, 2017",5,Awesome! Very convenient for producers. I can check in on my activity on the fly.

381,Geeeerrr,"February 23, 2016",1,Come on... Crashed on first scroll. Doesn't allow to monitor reposts. The thing that really irks though is that I have to download two apps from soundcloud and still get less functionality than the non-mobile site.
382,MPane,"February 25, 2016",1,Deleted it All this does is let you check your stats. None of the comments or reply to comments works as mentioned in the first point of the details. Just another app that was released before it was finished.
383,rellyWrotethat,"February 26, 2016",3,Messages why does this not allow us to reply the messages...thats all this needs for this app to be gold
384,K SPACELY,"March 4, 2016",1,"Eh When I first got the app it worked flawlessly, now I'm unable to load the app. When I open the app it just keeps loading. Currently on wifi and I have tried uninstalling and re installing and same issue. Please fix!!"

391,liquidsolidus,"February 26, 2016",2,"Meh. As a premium member, I don't see the value of (finally) releasing these handful of features as a separate app. "

395,Duedypoohuu,"April 19, 2016",1,Useless I was looking forward to t but found that it pretty much has nothing that I was missing from the other app. It actually kind of amazes me they would publish this app without the messenging feature.
396,Sierraroot,"August 13, 2016",4,Love... But where's the messaging I adore this app! It's great to check stats on the go. But... It doesn't have messaging. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add in the messaging function!!!

401,Smart Reviewer two,"February 25, 2016",1,can't even PM people waited 3 years for the dump truck of this app to come out just to get trashed on. I still have to use dolphin browser so you guys don't force us into your crappy online mobile site.
402,Von Vuai,"March 5, 2016",1,"Messages? Ok the notifications and stats are cool but, why can't I send or receive private messages? Maybe there will be another app just for that. I don't get how soundcloud can be so popular but fail so miserably..."

468,Cunningham1982,"March 18, 2020",5,"ITS AMAZING It’s pretty cool that we live in a day where are you can produce your own music and actually be heard by other people, let alone a community of artists/producers/performers! If anyone is having trouble uploading from their DAW(app being used) because there’s no option on a lot of them. Top right hand corner of the SoundCloud app is a download icon. Save ur work to ur files from your DAW and they will be available. On a side note I think it’s AWESOME that I can post 2 pics on my page!!! "

472,Cooln'rule,"August 1, 2017",1,terrible. honestly I love soundcloud bc I can post my music on there. but this app is absolute trash!!! it doesn't reload and doesn't show realtime notifications. smh. 
473,Anothercrazyartguy,"December 11, 2017",1,I’m giving a star per each feature I’m very happy with the app thus far but my satisfaction is limited so I’m giving a star for each feature that the app gains that brings parity to the desktop website and the older version of the apps the android soundcloud app it allows commenting in line with the track ... and what happened to the “social “ aspect of the soundcloud the messaging part has never been tapped Into on mobile this would make for a great app
474,ModernSynth,"April 16, 2018",3,Nice but flawed One major misconception that I will clear up:
475,Pzyklon,"June 17, 2018",1,Why a separate clumsy app? This is such a clumsy approach compared to the android app which says it like it is. I don’t need two apps on iOS when the job gets done on Android with one app. Please rectify your iOS app for more efficiency.
476,michaelcrwilson,"June 25, 2018",1,Stupid af How do you have a app where you can’t change your profile information like name bio header.etc 
477,clydecabbage,"July 8, 2018",1,No problems on an Android but Now I have an iPhone 6 and can’t see who reposts my song. That’s bogus! Fix this. We also want mobile messaging
478,Pjps91,"October 12, 2018",1,"Big fail After years of unloading audio and managing my account from my Android app quickly and easily, I find out there are two different iOS apps for different reasons, and neither uploads audio. Worst product design ever. So SoundCloud is just a station now and not conducive for actual creators, which makes the entire platform completely useless for me and other creators."

480,Parisnewyorkev,"February 23, 2016",5,Application utile et bien faite Pour suivre ses statistiques et rester en contact avec ses fans. Continuez SoundCloud
481,brscwms,"February 26, 2016",3,"Great job, potential, long over due Soundcloud the app was missing this. It's been a long time in the making that we can now view a bit more stats and analytics as creators. The Pulse app brings those tools together for you in a great format but you have to ask yourself, why another app? The Soundcloud app has been long overdue for improvements that would bring these features to the creators finger tips like being able to reply to comments, check out detailed stats, now we have it in  Pulse; and while its in its most primitive state, I think it will still give time for the Soundcloud engineers to think deeply about integrating these revisions in a Soundcloud 4.0. A newer Soundcloud app could give way for editing your profile and header photo, changing your album cover graphic to possibly even the most coveted feature to save offline downloaded content. The potential gives you the chills right? Need ideas Soundcloud. *whispers* Call me. ;-) @brscwms"
482,KingOfApps1,"May 8, 2016",1,Worst app ever Soundcloud has been bought out by a big company so it will destroy it. Like it does with every small business that becomes successful they end up watering it down and using the name to lure in the poor victims who pay for their artist who are top tier and on a real label. If you research they lost money the past couple of years and borrowed more money to push this Spotify imitation that's called soundcloud go. Take it from me these people are heartless no one runs the company and the emails are always ignored.
483,madMeesh,"August 1, 2016",2,"Could be better, fairly limited This app is good for checking stats but that's it. SC has been around for sometime now and although for the most part the platform is awesome, I don't feel it is as robust as other mature applications, i.e. Instagram etc. Sure audio is a challenge compared to photo data but that's no excuse. This app specifically, lacks a lot of basic features. I don't know why they have to separate out functionality for 'content creators' and 'content consumers' into 2 apps, this feels unnecessarily complex. There are better ways to separate concerns and maintain simplicity, they totally botched that up though. Anyway that's my rant -- in regards to Pulse, lacking features include, posting comments, editing track settings, editing profile, etc. A lot of stuff you would expect to be able to do as a content producer. To make matters even worse, SC won't let you login to the desktop app via the site because it just redirects you to the sh***y 'content consumer' iOS app.. So unless you can and want to go through all the trouble of spoofing your UA, forget being able to actually do anything useful via mobile. GJ soundcloud, who does your design?"

486,ThatAkwardBrony,"November 26, 2016",5,"Amazing! This app is amazing! I love that you can edit your song names and check comments and other stuff on the go! But there's something missing... Ok actually there's quite a bit missing. But they're minor things like being able to delete tracks and also the ability to edit your profile on the go like the profile picture and username. But other than that, it's an amazing tool. Thanks Soundcloud for making creator's lives easier :) ❤️"
487,Scientifik,"December 15, 2016",4,Finally Glad to see SoundCloud acknowledging the creators who got them started by giving us back all the features they stripped when they changed their strategy to be a bootleg consumer oriented Spotify. Not sure anyone really uses these features much anymore. I used to use the messages but haven't checked my inbox for a year but maybe if it was back in the app I would. Mostly use comments on private drafts of tracks. Would like to be able to comment on others tracks with this app too.
488,Djfidnekdnr,"January 16, 2017",3,Cmon SoundCloud I wanna be able to edit my profile through the app I wanna set a profile pic through the app and change my username through the app
489,SexWorkBB,"July 4, 2017",2,"Listen counts are incorrect... I mean, the sole reason I got this was to see how we are trending and some episodes show almost 100 listens off. Others show more, I'm just coming from being and android user, it was way more accurate there! Sad story."
