0,Sad bloomberg news reader,"May 14, 2018",1,"Long time Bloomberg reader- disenfranchised by the extreme monetization of the content I have been using this app for easily 4 years. I loved it when I first started using it, but, slowly but surely they began to monetize the content with ads which I am all for. However recently on top of the layers of ads and methods of monetizing their content which is already heavily subsidized by Bloomberg’s main business of selling institutional investors trading systems, they have thrown a 35 dollars a month pay wall in front of the same content they have given the public access to with ad support. 35 dollars a month is far too much for an application that has become more and more restrictive in how you use it (in an intelligent but frustrating attempt to maximize ad-space values) this may work for the people who you already have subscribing to your Bloomberg systems but that’s an obscene amount of money for the news especially to a millennial that is just seeking some less biased news to inform him in this world that’s upside down in terms of the news presented to the public. Rethink your pricing structure please 35 dollars a month for a student and to be honest for most people who don’t work in finance is just far too much."
1,Ccox4669,"November 27, 2018",3,"Terrible Research App This app is supposed to be able to deliver you market-related news. That’s why it exists. However, unless it’s current or fairly recent, do not expect quality archives - even of Bloomberg’s own old articles. I’ve used this since it’s debut, very bumpy road of updates, addition of ads, more monetization, now paywall, all of which are tertiary to DELIVERING NEWS. If I type in a stock symbol and you can’t even bother bringing your own articles written about the company, what is the point of using the app?!"
2,tlsalias,"October 23, 2017",2,"A great app from a great company I was excited to see an update to the app because it has been such a pain. All in all, to sum it up: great content terrible after delivery. Lots of user interface bugs. The Apple TV version is also similar in that it has excellent world class content with poor streaming delivery and difficult navigation."
3,Oglopfoosbottom,"March 1, 2019",1,"Paying for Commercials? This app has frustrated me greatly. I am an unlimited digital subscriber and yet I still have to sit through ad after ad after ad. Why? That makes no sense to me and I plan to cancel my subscription at this point because I’m just not sure what this gets me. Also, the app and website look sleek, but I have generally found to be a nightmare to actually navigate for content I’m looking for. It also drives me up a wall that I pay what I pay and yet I can only see excerpts instead of full interviews most the time. I wanted to pay for less noise and deeper insight, I got neither of those two things. If they addressed some of those issues, this would easily be a 5 star review. Remove ads for customers that pay you, and make your video catalog and radio catalog simpler to navigate and more reliable (holy crap do their proxy servers crash constantly)."
4,Keith-My-Ath,"October 4, 2019",2,Fix App Live TV Ads Can someone please explain the live tv ad algorith?! 
5,rnshwa00,"July 18, 2018",1,A once nice app deliberately (?) crippled The older (black background) version of Bloomberg was *so* much better one wonders why they seemingly deliberately stripped out so much of what made it special. Was it to drive users to an expensive paid app that most investors won't purchase?
6,Fred.2,"July 7, 2018",5,"Bloomberg radio I was using Bloomberg radio until they made me use this app. I have to hit 10 times more buttons to get to the radio. I do not mind the commercials, but I start and stop the radio about 20 times a day. I do not want to go throw all the hassle of hitting all the steps to listen to the radio.  "
7,Wrbellsugar,"August 8, 2018",4,Bloomberg! I love the app! I watch Bloomberg TV and listen to Bloomberg Radio all the time. It would however be nice to save commodities such as Brent crude to your watchlist even if they are saved as favorites somewhere else as a favorite on the app.
8,Surveillance Groupie,"December 19, 2018",3,"Buggy app Love the content but the I find the app buggy.  I was forced to switch from the B-Radio app to this app and ever since I have incurred way more commercials.  The preroll ads are very annoying because if I am listening to a radio show and the app or stream drops I am forced to watch another preroll ad before reengaging.  Sometimes I am hit with a preroll ad, then more ads and then finally several mins later I get to the content.  Vs if I open up iHeartRadio I can immediately start streaming.  "
9,Aardvark of the north,"November 5, 2017",5,"Like the news, the app is a pain Bloomberg’s coverage of financial  news is first-rate.  Unfortunately the app is not of that quality.  It is slow, won’t let you swipe past a story until all the ads have loaded, which can easily take 5 seconds.  On my iPad I constantly find myself launching the video attached to the story when I don’t want to ... then it’s again a slow process before the app will let you close it.  "
10,TRemlinger16,"September 17, 2017",5,"Bloomberg is a must have app for college students I'm a sophomore in college and we don't have cable at my house, so it's often difficult to contribute to classroom discussions about current events. Bloomberg is a quick and easy way of staying up to date on what's happening around the world. I find myself spending more time on Bloomberg's mobile app than on my other popular apps such as Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook."
11,Newbie1501,"October 12, 2017",2,"Back office could be better This is a good source of news, however:"
12,pthatph,"March 20, 2018",1,"Freedom of choice The original app was actually very useful, especially the watch list.  Unfortunately, every update made the features worse - the latest allows you only 25 stocks to monitor (probably because the developers know their app freezes or slows down to uselessness beyond 25) and two watchlists max (so too bad for you if you are monitoring more than 50 issues); plus, it will auto shutdown after a few minutes of use, without the courtesy of even a simple warning.  All these new features in the updates were most likely deliberate, to hopefully make one subscribe to their professional version of the app. That's business! Still your choice to use or not - it's for free, after all."
13,The business addict,"August 17, 2018",1,Disappointed I pay for the Bloomberg channel with my Charter television subscription. When I watch the channel I also put up with all of the advertising. 
14,Dkaaye,"April 1, 2019",3,"Recently, the app just evaporates from view From a paid subscriber using an iPad Air:  A few months back the Bloomberg app began simply dropping off the screen (leaving me at my ""home"" screen).  This seems to happen when I press a link to open a new page (story, video, chart, etc.). The failure rate is about one in four or five attempts.  This problem is unique to Bloomberg ... other apps work correctly.  It's very frustrating to use the app now and since no ""fix"" has appeared in several month's I think it's time to unsubscribe."
15,g1ymoore,"November 20, 2019",1,Ads on a paid service is greedy I really enjoy the content that Bloomberg provides but that has been completely overshadowed by the invasion of ads. As a paying subscriber I do not want to be flooded with ads.
16,GtrInLA,"October 12, 2019",2,"Doesn’t support Dark Mode For what they want us to pay monthly they should at least support native dark mode, this alone is a deal breaker because who doesn’t like to read news before going to sleep?... and it’s so out of control bright white that it’s laughable.  The app appears to be written by a 9 year old, and what’s with the ads? I’m paying you (was) for NO ads.... complete disappointment! Very liberal leaning too, I don’t want conservative news I want it centered, non discriminative coverage. I’ll most likely cancel once the promotion expires and just continue with Apple News, best deal out there, at least Wall Street Journal is a little more centered..."
17,j-say,"February 26, 2020",3,Love the news but stock updates need work! The news is always great and laid out nice. My big issue is stock updates. I just looked at 9:45am and it still shows the price from yesterday. It doesn’t say after hours or premarket prices and doesn’t update in the morning for a while. If I go on google and type in stocks or go to Merrill's app it’s always the latest.
18,BloombergHostage,"November 18, 2019",1,Good luck trying to cancel your subscription... Customer service is essentially non-existent and it blows my mind.  I want to temporarily cancel my digital subscription with hopes of rejoining later when it makes more sense for my situation.
19,Ara.O.,"September 25, 2019",1,"Used to be good If you want to sit through 90% of commercials and 10% actual business news, then this app is for you. The app used to be great when you could get excellent business and world news as well as top notch market commentary; however, you now have to listen to commercial after commercial until you get a quick market update or some nugget news before the commercials start again. I’ve deleted and downloaded this app several times hoping “this time it will be different,” but it’s still the same. It’s too bad because I used to rely on Bloomberg for update date business news."
20,Back to school,"October 5, 2017",1,"Lifetime user finally gave up on this I've been a user of this app since 2006. I've seen a lot of features and news and data and charts be removed since its high point. The watchlist has been near useless for anything except a total, not accepting edits, only additions,  when it functions at all. It's about as far from user-friendly and elegant as I can imagine. Shameful considering how dense and useful their screens used to be. The latest update just crashes on iOS 10 and that's the end of the line for my phone. "
21,Zan320,"October 13, 2017",5,"Balanced news CNN hates Trump while Fox treats him like a prince.  The truth is somewhere in the middle (well, IMO, the truth is closer to one side than the other, but anyway...). Bloomberg seems to have more facts and less editorial slant. Sure, we’re always at the mercy of the editor who chooses what is “worthy” of reporting, and we can’t know what wasn’t included, but from what I can tell be looking around, Bloomberg does a pretty good - and fair - job."
22,Mtaylor305,"November 11, 2017",1,Update is horrible Still more of the same. Opened app and the first 2 articles are hit pieces on republicans. What happened to financial news?
23,Behavior theory,"May 2, 2018",4,Warning about the update! Article Limits! When did Bloomberg start limiting my article reading? 9 Per month? Seriously? I guess I don’t have to read articles with your commercials embedded. 
24,mpangst,"June 6, 2018",3,Interesting content. Costly subscription doesn’t remove Ads I’ve been enjoying the news digitally on iOS and MacOS. After signing up for the costly subscription I still see advertisements in the app and on the website which is disturbing considering a premium price. The watch list seems appealing to me so far but it would in fact be better to improve the summary and overview capabilities of the listings for small device screens. Perhaps allowing landscape format could help some situations.
25,RayAppRev,"July 26, 2018",1,"I didn't expect this from Bloomberg! In 2018, I have to drop the ratings to 1 or below, not because of the excellent information that Bloomberg's highly talented team of professionals compile (Kudos) but because they are forcing a subscription model on a variety of services including live tv. I guess my ratings wouldn't bother Bloomberg but app ratings work similar to investment ratings and not always relates to the app design itself and can also reflect public views on the company's motives."
26,LET'S GO CAPS!!!,"July 31, 2018",1,"Media feed needs fixing on most delivery methods New BBG allows 30 minutes of free live TV daily. Unfortunately, because of buffering or other system issues, you’ll watch the first minute, then the first minute again, then the second minute, and then the second minute again, and so on. Happens on iPhone, iPad, AppleTV BBG app, and Fidelity Apple TV app. Radio also frequently drops and replays the same ads. Stopped reading articles as $35/mo is overpriced. Thank goodness I can still get Matt Levine’s Money Stuff via email (would be great if readers knew which paywall the links are behind though—hidden behind proofpoint urldefense)."
27,Bearly3000,"June 14, 2019",1,"Deleted the Bloomberg App today I deleted your app today because one of the three « things you need to know today » was a blurb on Sarah Sanders leaving the press secretary position, and it was rude and obnoxious.   I get that she doesn’t share your political philosophy, and you don’t like her boss, but it’s an incredibly hard job, she’s a working mother and I believe she tried her best to do it well and get people the info they wanted.  She’s leaving - couldn’t you have been gracious for 2 or 3 lines and wished her well?   "
28,Gigigigigi1324,"August 4, 2019",1,"Poorly explained and defended view points They only give a one-sided views on everything happening. The demonize and take quotes out of context of people they don’t like or agree with. Just because you don’t agree with someone doesn’t mean you can demonize them by taking there quotes out of context. Very sad to see more fake news in the news circle, but I shouldn’t be surprised by it... won’t be recommending or using from now on unless they change to showing facts as facts, stop demonizing people they don’t care for or agree with, and give more than just a liberal view of events happening in today’s world."
29,TonyNguyen887,"June 23, 2019",5,"Career enhancer...no...career saver!! Reading at least 60% of the content published daily - your business intelligence has really helped my career and enabled me to impress peers and supervisors at work and has also aided me in getting into my dream educational institution (nailed the interview)- University of Cambridge. I’m mostly an introvert but when it comes to talking about business issues, I can initiate and lead endless discussions thanks to you!"
30,MBradley1013,"October 7, 2017",5,Great business news Really enjoy this app and the variety of business and world news discussed in a manner that is to the point.  A good collection of opinionated articles on current events and economic commentary as well.  I find myself spending way more time reading everything on a daily basis and ignoring my social media.  Job well done Bloomberg!  Thank you!
31,Juanpaulo333,"October 31, 2017",5,"Media playback I am now unable to take full advantage of Bloomberg’s high quality contento because the app does not allow media playback without leaving the app, which is a bit frustrating and was possible with older versions. I hope the feature is enabled in future versions"
32,Frustrated light searcher,"November 2, 2017",5,"Easy to use stock and copper futures Intuitive and informative with very current financial and political news. Good information about what impacts what on national and international scene. Long time user, just the basic free content. Excellent site. Have my own quirky approach to investing but this is one good information site for reaching my goals of financial independence.   PS  .. I made it unless the world blows up."
33,abk New York,"January 30, 2018",5,"No font adjustments & no look up Nice design and all, but the app lacks some basic features— 1. It doesn’t allow users to adjust font sizes to their preference &  2. The “look up” feature doesn’t work when reading articles."
34,$1jsn,"July 9, 2018",5,"The New Bloomberg  App I too am a long time listener with no financial background. I have benefited from the exposure to new opinions from your guests as well as the various hosts. It previosly provided a,“public good”. "
35,EASOCO,"November 13, 2018",1,Much worse than the previous app Briefly here are some of the issues I found to listen to Bloomberg radio:
36,RiverCamp,"January 28, 2019",3,"Disappointed Came to Bloomberg for something different than the nonsense on CNN, Fox etc.  More of the same on Bloomberg.  24/7 hate on for Trump. I like watching Bloomberg TV but when trying to un-dock the TV and watch as a stand alone while using browser it has problems.  Bloomberg should stop worrying about what soda sizes people can drink and spend time improving the app and content. Stick to business reporting and remain neutral on politics seems a much better route to take."
37,Greg089,"March 25, 2020",1,"Massive downgrade, stealth attempt to double the price Used to get Business Week digital with my print subscription in its own app. Now that app has been removed and I’m being told I have to use this app (which is cluttered with a lot of non-BW stuff I don’t care about or want to buy), and that suddenly my subscription is worthless and I need to pay AGAIN. To make it worse, I asked to end my print subscription due to this terrible change and was told they would immediately stop sending me the printed renaming BW magazines I have PAID for.  Greed, mismanagement, and incompetence all rolled into this app and it’s support."
38,Lazy Robot,"February 12, 2020",1,"Not a good enough replacement I subscribe to businessweek and I used the businessweek app to read articles. They are getting rid of the businessweek app and moving it into bloomberg, but the existing subscription I have does not work. They are forcing me to subscribe to bloomberg digital which is more than 10x the price. Furthermore, this app does not let you set the homepage to businessweek. So they want to extract hundreds more dollars from me and give me a worse app. Why in the f would I do that? Im just going to start getting used to reading businessweek via Apple’s news app, it is a channe there and my subscription transfers."
39,Jim Sack,"December 10, 2019",2,"Stale The reporters an anchors are superb, but the commercial breaks are long, repetious and startlingly loud. Every time I click on a commercial plays before content comes on. It is the same growingly obnoxious patter. PSA are ancient.  Whoever writes their spots needs to take RTv 101 over. I long for the humor of “I’m a Cat,” although that is Stall as year old Wonder Bread.  The current crop of spots are deadly.  Breaks are so long it interrupts the flow of programming prompting me to pull my AirPods and do something else. As for the air guests they all speak in the conditional tense hedging their comments and insights to the point of uselessness."
40,Redline,"January 1, 2018",5,"Bloomberg is my news filter With about every other source turning to clickbait and emotionally driven coverage, I can count on Bloomberg to deliver the bottom line on a lot more than the market. And the market coverage is still excellent. "
41,wayfarer92,"February 15, 2018",2,"Updates have ruined this app A few years ago Bloomberg was the best app in their field. Unfortunately, it’s become one of the worst as the developers have made several unnecessary changes. One such example is the markets page. In earlier versions one could find futures in one or two swipes whereas with the current revisions it’s a cumbersome fumble."
42,Bloomberg Fan in NY,"December 19, 2018",4,Great App but Room to Impove The Bloomberg app is much better than prior versions with combination of video and podcasts. The only thing that might make it better is repeating ads after being disconnected from the online network. I would recommend getting the app for both the younger business generation as well as the older generation who like the radio format.
43,Giovanni m. Henriques VII,"December 20, 2018",3,Once great The information and those that wrote for Blumberg taught me how to invest… Bloomberg has now changed to more of a CNN model and a lot of the people that had sustainable and substantial information in order to grow as an investor have been watered down but give us three stars A little sad because of the commercialism now that the number has moved to although although I still enjoy it and use it daily
44,alphabo1,"February 3, 2019",4,This was the best I love this app.
45,_KitanA_,"October 13, 2019",1,"Rip off Application allows for 5 free articles a month, demanding significant fee for full access. And that’s despite the fact that the app is filled with commercial advertisements. What’s even more frustrating is the overly sensitive interface, which often leads to article being open, while user simply attempting to scroll down, thus reducing the free article count. "
46,GonzoJoe,"April 15, 2020",2,"Lacking in so many ways... 1.  Battery drain is significant.  I’ve turned of the video auto play, but the app still causes my iPad to heat up, and drains the battery quickly.  Not sure why!?!?"
47,MN282766,"February 21, 2020",2,"Gone downhill I used to love this app, it was my go-to news source and pulse on the markets.  There is still good content, but I feel like I’m waking on eggshells with the article limit.  Also, they’ve slowly removed useful information (like US bond yields) from default settings, which I have no idea how to re-institute.  I sadly will probably look for another source for my information. I’m fine with ads, but really dislike the exorbitant price they want to charge for subscription."
48,Loki00001,"October 19, 2019",1,$35 a month for this?!? This app is now telling me I have exceeded my free articles and  need to purchase a subscription to read what is given out for free on their website. 
49,Kev720,"February 20, 2020",2,"Was once the only app I used for market news... With the most recent update, I can no longer track the US 10y Treasury bond.  I am a loa officer and depend on knowing what the 10yr bond is tracking at all times.  With the most recent update, I am not able to locate it anywhere in the app. Maybe it user error but i’ve been using this app 7+ years and have always been able to find it.  Will delete this app and move on to a competitor app."
50,Travsat13,"January 30, 2018",5,"Invaluable Superior to many services for which I pay hundreds of dollars per year.  I do wish that Bloomberg would offer a service pitched between their excellent, but limited, free service and their professional service costing tens of thousands of dollars per year per seat."
51,flyingdutch18,"May 26, 2018",1,"Forget the free app - Bloomberg has a new business model With the introduction of version 4 in December 2016, Bloomberg has changed an excellent business and stock market app into one of the worst, if not the worst on the market. This of course has been done on purpose. Bloomberg wants to distinguish the free version from their very expensive paid offerings. The result: Users have deleted the app in droves, and rightly so. Update 2018: Bloomberg has continued to increase the paywall. Articles are not free anymore if you want to read more than ten a month."
52,M15liz!,"October 3, 2018",3,"Stop with the Anti Trump opinion story notifications The App I use most for world market monitoring, but the anti trump stuff is getting old. So much is geared anti trump that it makes it hard to use the app. Have an opinion section and run stories like that all you want. But the bias has effected market reports and I don’t want notifications of opinion stories presented like breaking news is getting really intolerable."
53,Sye K,"December 6, 2018",1,Two many ads every time app is select I don’t mind listening to ads in the the middle of the program. But every time I turn on the app I have to listen 3 or ads before I can listen to the program that is on. Not only that when I Resume after a phone call I had to listen again to ads. So I will be removing this app very soon if I am subjected to this kind of forced listing to all these ads that I had listen so many times. You have only few ads to run. So very annoying.
54,Mike-in-Boston,"January 28, 2019",1,"Do NOT bother downloading this app! After seven consecutive commercials following launch of the app, and before even commencing play of their programming, I just got tired of waiting for content and deleted this pathetic app."
55,tahos,"January 12, 2020",1,"Bye Bloomberg I’ve used the Bloomberg app since version 1 on iOS - YEARS. Mainly to do quick market index price lookups and read articles. Over the past couple of years, the news coverage has become blatantly biased toward the left/liberal spectrum, to the point of ridiculousness. Very recently, they have reduced the number of free articles available to just a few. "
56,AgEcon,"December 10, 2019",1,"Ad bugs glitch live video feed I have a monthly subscription, and am willing to pay more if I could only stop/reduce the sheer amount of ads on the site. I try to watch the live feed, but the way the ads are set to move the screen to the ad content when it pops up totally messes up the live feed, freezing it. Drives me nuts!!! If your going to force ads for things I now REFUSE to buy, at least fix the video so I can still watch it after you shove the commercials down my throat."
57,DEMOBILE,"January 17, 2020",1,"Fake news for their owner’s political agenda Since Miley has announced his campaign the articles have gotten worse. Stock markets doing great? Let’s run a story on how bad President Trump is doing. All time high? Let’s run a story that President Trump is going to be impeached. China deal? Let’s run a story how President Trump has hurt the American farmers. Lies, lies, and more lies. Sorry people are seeing right through this political bs. If you want an app to watch the market and not slam their owners political views down their your throat. This is not it. I’m deleting this app not that they will care."
58,LanceF@$$,"May 2, 2020",4,Student I’m finding Bloomberg to be a must have news source for building my portfolio and or economic development. Highly recommended professional service. I love them!

59,Micheal Padraig,"March 9, 2020",5,"Bug Developers.... you have a bug in both the iPad and iPhone versions.    Intermittently the sound drops out... video continues.  The time of no sound varies, but usually, I just close out and restart the app.   My hardware and software are latest versions."
60,gonzagafan1,"September 12, 2017",5,Great app but. . Very irritating that Bloomberg automatically stops playing whatever audio I am listening to. God forbid I want to read headlines while listening to music or a podcast. . Same irritation with the website and auto play video.

On monday 2/9/18 i sold everything and put the sales in their portfolio section and kept checking with sighs of relief as the losses mounted.  Allowing multiple lists is helpful too.

67,YAH33,"December 15, 2018",1,Simple horrible....CNBC is free and better Why arent the bloomberg developers listening to their users? The production version from Nov 2016 was wonderful. The new version seems to have fallen off a mountain. By limiting my ability to toggle between radio/live media AND the rest of my iphone is ridiculous. I knos you have advertise to sell but seriously!!
68,pre-moistened,"April 8, 2019",1,"way over priced The reporting and news is great, but for $36 a month I would like to see articles about stocks that matter to me.  A lot of opinion pieces and some good journalism but if I want to see an article from last year about a company I care about I cant.  In return for my $36 I get sprayed with a firehose of news and no way to take a breath and pick through it.  I do get the pleasure of google ads placed in the middle of the articles and throughout the app.  Its a losing offer."
69,gatesbuster,"November 7, 2019",4,Great content with buggy app I wish that the app wouldn’t be clogged with advertising. You pay $34/month for a subscription and you still get annoying ads. I also found the app to be slow in loading pages. Very slow almost unusable on a slower iPad.
70,Fastquattro,"October 5, 2017",5,Best 10 minutes reading for business leaders. Somehow Bloomberg always managed to get the important business news out in an accurate summary.  As must read for business students as well.
71,Looking281,"December 14, 2017",4,"Barely Worth Consideration Using the Bloomberg app is like driving a 1955 Ford. It gets you down the road, but not much power or style. The editorial staff is talented, but wastes time telling us same old hate speech. They refuse to call The President by his title. It’s just not showing proper respect for our Duly Elected World Leader. "
72,Jay-nyc,"January 5, 2018",3,"It ain’t great! Since rolling out a new feel to the app with some apparent new charting tools, which coincided with the loss of some basic charting functionality, I’d have to say the app took a major dive in usefulness.

Then they just eliminated the Bloomberg TV app, which allowed you to create a video playlist and had streaming quotes at the bottom.  Two amazing apps removed in place of a piece of junk.

Whatever management droids signed off on that should be demoted or fired.   The ads are obnoxious.  Constantly interrupting and cheapening the readers experience.  Losing patience with an overpriced product.  If the content was better and more consistent and the app could handle images it might be closer to a fair value.

124,LiveMusicAlways,"July 6, 2018",1,Should expect... The app is alright but has gotten worse over the many years I have used it.

But purely having a ton of news is often a problem if it's disorganized.  Bloomberg app wins on its ability to select only the markets and categories you want, arrange them in order of importance for you, and quickly scan through articles through paginations.  The app looks simple, but you can ""feel"" the app programming and data infrastructure in the back is more solid than some other news apps, making this feel smoother and less ""clunky"" thank other apps.  While individual equity quotes and charts are delayed, the major market indices are close to real time and the market summaries for all markets around the world, not just certain local markets, is a must have in the new globalized, digital world."

643,Steve 1776,"July 17, 2014",5,"Bloomberg propaganda This media operation represents a complete leftist/socialist propaganda. Objective seems to be on destruction of our constitution/bill of rights and therefore downfall of our country. They love to be the cheerleaders for the private criminal banking cartel or federal reserve. They love to promote inflationary policies of the fed which are robbing American people while enriching tiny elite who are first in line to receive the mine from the fed. Any sound views regarding investing into precious metals are suppressed and ignored. Janet Yellen, Paul Krugman and other Keynesian lunatics are propped up as some sort of experts on real economy inching us closer and closer to real hard core socialism. If you can make yourself believe that socialism/marksism is good, that American constitution is not the supreme law of the land, that printing money is not inflation, that guns don't reduce crime, that u didn't build your business, that in flatiron is good and that economy is recovering then don't worry about it.....

I’ll fire it up at least once a day to catch the latest business news. I used to love it. Unfortunately, with each new update, the app has been deteriorating in quality. Features were removed (like offline mode) and slowly more and more advertisements started creeping in. It’s finally come to the point where the app is unusable because the ads are just too distracting (animation, white backgrounds on the black app color, quantity, shifting the content down as they slowly load etc.. ). What’s even worse is that the ads are riddled with bugs. For awhile the app would think you clicked the ad just by scrolling past it. And now in this version the ads randomly (and repeatedly) load in a new browser window. It’s so unfortunate but the ads make Bloomberg's news content un-readable."

Guess where that still lives today?  Bloomberg - no crap, no personalities verging on the shock jock nonsense of Rick Santelli, no overnight diabetes meter commercials preying on their audience.  Bloomberg focuses on news and critical analysis of the world, financial and otherwise, that we live in.  There is nothing better on financial TV than Bloomberg Surveillance, the thinking-person's playbook of the financial newsday.

The full system is still the gold standard, but apparently whoever is running the mobile platform has allowed it to become little more than a liberal rag-sheet.  I can't get through a single day without an article notification that might as well have come from slate or the huff post. The writing is unsophisticated and weak, the research and support is slim-to-nonexistent, and there is no attempt to maintain an objective and merely informative tone.  Instead it's nearly all d-rate opinion pieces that sound as though they're written by recent college grads who haven't a clue about anything.  The world doesn't need this kind of third-rate regurgitated crap from the liberal propaganda echo-chamber.  Nor does it need the comparable crap from the breitbarts of the world.  Stop trying to influence people and simply inform.  Responsible journalism is what is needed.  Until I see a major improvement in the quality of Bloomberg's news content, I have no use for it.

The application is segmented into several sections.  There's a news section with the top financial stories, another section tells you what various markets have done overnight, and another section where you can put in company-specific ticker symbols.  The index section is very impressive, as you can drill down on the index and see what sectors are moving as well as what individual stocks are moving.  Under the stock-specific section, you can put in all sorts of obscure ticker symbols for stocks worldwide.  Clicking on the ticker will bring up a description of the stock and current news on the stock.  This knocks the socks off the competition, as most Bloomberg products do.

As for market information, I have yet to find an app that offers the level of depth that Bloomberg offers. Many other apps offer quotes and charts, but I don't know of any that provide detailed stats, for example, on funds, such as top holdings, expense ratios, dividend frequency, etc. - just about everything I need to research a particular fund. Likewise with respect to stocks. I would need at least two other apps to get the depth and breath of the information this one provides and that's not to mention quotes on futures, bonds, currencies, key rates.....and all in one app. For quotes, stats, and information on markets, this app has no equal."

I've tried hard to get used to it but it isn't worth it.  It has very low density of info.  It takes 5 or more taps to get to frequently accessed info that used to be on the home screen or 1 tap away.  Some key information, like on watchlists, doesn't seem to be available at all.  This is all especially true on a tablet where the app looks like a small phone display.  I hate trashing apps because I know how hard developers work... I used to be one.  And I know anytime an app UI changes there are people that get upset just because of the change, even though in the long run it is better.  Unfortunately, in this case, the new app is so bad compared to the old that I just had to write a review... mostly because I'm so upset at losing what was a key tool for me.

662,Gpshik,"February 25, 2012",1,"Lol Bloomberg and Apple put out a lot of hype on Bloomberg Anywhere for iPhone and it simply doesn't deliver.  Most users  (Bloomberg has the data on this) use a Bloomberg (at $1500 to $1800 a month per terminal or user ) for its Message (MSG) or chat (IB) functionality. The appeal of a PDA as a iPhone or Blackberry is access to these messages when away for desktop terminal.  Not being tied to this desktop during a trading day is potentially very productive for brokers and traders.    The problem there is the server that sends these messages out on an iPhone can have big delays in the MSG and IB send/receive times (up to 15-20min in my 1month experience).  Rather the Blackberry server continually pushes messages out (worst delay in my 6yr experience was 1-2min, unless Blackberry or Bloomberg were having system problems, this occurs approx every 6 to 9 months).  Now for those who interact with clients on these message functions imagine what a 15 min delay does to yr business if client sends order to buy $250mil UST 10yrs or sell 5bil notional of Eurodollar Futures?"

Biting the hand that feeds you is one thing, but do you really have to gnaw it off?! The ""attack journalist"" interview of Tom Perkins was completely OTT, with the sweetly smiling interviewer working Perkins over for the better part of ten minutes, ignoring a half dozen apologies and clarifications, then actually calling Perkins the largest ""a..hole""in California, by proxy. Notwithstanding what you feel about an interview subject, do you really need to publicly thrash a retired 80 year old businessman like that? For what?

Through intuitive design, powerful app features, integrated news -- and a crew dedicated to quickly converting in-depth TV or radio interviews to online media, this app has earned a prime spot on my iPhone's main screen. Keep up the great work both on-the-air and online. Bloomberg continuously sets the bar higher for the likes of CNBC and FBN."

Most recently, the audio & video have become unsynced after commercial breaks, requiring a restart, and thus having to listen to yet another intro commercial on top of the TV commercials already played.

701,The_Minotaur,"October 25, 2012",5,"They fixed the crash problem This has been a great app in the past. During the past year they added videos and notifications which are not easy to turn off. Then, following another update, the stock prices disappeared. Reinstalling didn't help. Then it crashed after a second, as others have pointed out. And moving the app (off my first page off apps, until they fix it) crashed the whole device! "
702,ManishNJ,"October 8, 2013",5,"Terrible upgrade This is a terrible upgrade. The old app used to be far better for regular users to scan thru all the Bloomberg news and read what you want. The new one breaks it all down and it is an effort to switch from section to section, region to region. Even worse, there is no way to turn off videos and flashy images. Images cause the screen to be very busy and information is now fragmented. Basically unusable compared to smooth design of the earlier version. Please fire the guy who approved new design, he clearly never used the app before."
703,Chris Dall42,"June 22, 2014",5,"Essential Wish they let you bookmark articles, but hands down one of the best sources of information. Even if the articles are sometimes liberally leaning to the slightly left, with regard to substance and content their authors, editors, analysts, production teams, and the whole crew that makes it happen deserve at least a round of applause and much deserved appreciation. "
704,WILDDAWG_93,"August 15, 2014",4,"Best Financial Mkt App Out There If looking for a financial market App to keep track of markets, news, and your portfolio then this App does it. I use it daily. Bloomberg has continued to make improvements which is nice. I do hope it will continue to innovate such as having separate tabs for own's portfolio and watch list. Also in the portfolio tab, sold stocks should be moved to a new multi-currency line. I total portfolio return line over time should be added with desired benchmarks should be included to compare one's performance against the market. I've got more ideas, but that's it for now. Worth having this App is the bottom line."

I use it daily but the radio piece has too many ads. You are competing with NPR and the abundant ads make it much less attractive compared to other more easily accessible options. The radio piece has made me a huge fan of BLoomberg and I'm consuming your web/mobile content way more. But the radio ads have to go. As soon as there's another option without ads I would gladly switch and probably take my content impressions with me. Just honest feedback hope it helps"

707,Rrothman1,"December 19, 2016",5,"Looks and feels clean I read some of the other reviews, but I actually like this version of the app.  I think once the watchlist and Bloomberg TV stream is restored, people will grow to love it.  From my perspective, I mainly only use the app to get news anyway.  Love the new navigation at the bottom of the screen.  Seems way more in line with other apps and very intuitive.  I do miss the black and am not a fan of the new branding colors, but overall I'm still reading news just the same way I also did.  I also really like the what you missed section."
708,Lecroyant,"January 20, 2017",4,My first review This is my first review and it is done out of frustration  about this app which messed up everything. I wish I did not update (i.e downgrade :( ) to this new version. 
709,Sculler7,"March 31, 2017",4,Terrible update please go back to old versions This used to be one of the best apps and I used it every day for the excellent interviews and the charts. The charts in particular were useful because you could look at three days to 10 years which was very helpful in understanding commodities. 
710,Ianakamel,"July 17, 2008",4,"Some Tips For Next Update First let me say I love what you've done with this app, both in its original version and especially with the update.  There are, however, a few things that you could add that would truly make the app spectacular: (1) the ability to add different price points for the same stock (i.e. I bought 100 shares of Apple at 170 and 50 shares of Apple at 172 - as it stands now, I can't reflect this reality in the ""stock portfolio"" section); and (2) breaking news notifications about specific companies designated by the user.  Do those two things and you have yourself one ridiculous app."
711,Saint Martin,"July 25, 2008",4,"Great app ... needs tweak though. Under ""My Stocks"" you can tap the columns to change the variables.  The first column you can switch between ""ticker"" and ""name"".  ""Ticker"" is straight forward and works.  ""Name"" unfortunately runs into a situation where if you have multiple funds from a single company they might have similar names and not allow you to see whats what.  T. Rowe Price has multiple international funds that are listed ""T. Rowe Price International xxxx"" with xxxx being the rest of the name we can't see.  "
712,ColoradoRed,"September 27, 2008",5,"Outstanding app, great features This is the best app I've downloaded yet, hands down.  It puts the native ""Stocks"" app to shame.  You get pretty much anything you'd ever want to know about the financial markets in one place.  The news is full featured- like having the WSJ in your pocket.  I love being able to drill down into the indices, see market leaders/laggards.  Also love being to track my own porfolio.  The full-screen charts/graphs when you turn the iPhone to landscape mode is a nice touch.  I'd also comment that so far it has been rock-solid reliable, zero crashes so far."
713,qagsdfpiouAH;aeofahwy;pawe'[hedcx[o;iAIH,"October 26, 2008",4,"Better than most, missing major currencies and commodities This is better than most of the applications out there, but it lacks the ability to customize a view.  I have to access different screen to see commodities, stock, exchanges, and currencies.  It would be really nice if I could put the exchanges, commodities, currencies, and stocks that I want to track on a single screen.  But, this is not possible.  It is also missing currencies.  For example, you can find just about every major Asian currency, but the Philippine peso is nowhere to be found and cannot be added."
714,Shadowyman,"March 11, 2014",5,"Very useful Has lots of great price info on stocks and commodities. I look at the futures all the time.  News in the main stream is a little limited. Leans toward macro issues and overseas without much specific top company-specific news unless it's a Dow stock or something. To get that, you have to look it up ticker by ticker. I don't mind doing that of course if I want to check a specific company's news, but I'd like to see the most important company news in the main news stream. App is still worth 5 stars though for the price info."
715,Balls phased,"June 18, 2014",5,"The Game Changer The Bloomberg app has provided me an entrance into the finance world at a young age. After having used the app for nearly 6 months I have become vastly privileged to have learned as much as I have. I have begun personally investing and have had success. Without this app I would have never discovered the potential and love I have for investing, let alone trying to understand the complex business world. This app is a game changer and great for any of those interested in not only getting their foot into the door, but for those who are experienced as well."
716,Yyztr,"February 14, 2015",1,"Greatly reduced content One of Bloomberg's strengths is the sheer volume of news reporting across topics and geographies. The older versions let you scroll through dozens, if not well over 100 stories that had been reported over the past few days. If I had some down time, I would scroll through and catch up on the reporting. Now the app has been dumbed down to show only a handful of recent stories in each category -- I don't see a way to access more than those few. This has greatly reduced the app's utility for me and I find myself spending much less time with it and turning to other news sources instead.  I would actually pay good money to return to the Bloomberg app of a year ago -- that's my promise to you, Bloomberg."
717,J Alrik,"December 29, 2015",5,"Historically great app ruined by ads The latest Bloomberg app updates have unfortunately ruined what was one of my favorite apps. When one opens the app and clicks on any news story, it launches a new safari window with an ad (which usually does not successfully load). This repeats as you scroll down in a story. Presumably this is an app error and the ad is meant to load within the news story in the app since there is a gray scale box for it - but the end result, sadly, is that bloomberg's great content is no longer readable."
718,MoreEZMoney,"July 31, 2016",1,"Bloomberg going DOWNHILL Very disappointed to say my favorite app period, is going downhill. Others have expressed dissatisfaction with the in-article ads. They are awful. They take forever to load and the page jumps around and you loose you're spot on the page. Also the home page used to house the most relevant news articles so you can quickly catch up on recent developments. Now it's host to what seems to be fluff articles about summer beers and million dollar homes. Stick those ad-like articles where they belong, in the lifestyle section. Bring back the former glory of this business news app or I'm moving on to Pulse news. Which I ditched when it required a LinkedIn account, which made no sense as the two are completely unrelated."
719,SteveSCT,"April 19, 2017",5,Why doesn't radio play in the background ? I find myself using this app to check on the markets at various times during the day.  I'm generally pleased - though I think that Market news should rank higher.  
720,Jason is taken?,"August 10, 2008",5,"Fantastic application I can't believe it's free!  I initially thought it was an iPhone access point for the Bloomberg Professional service, but no, it's just the best way to stay on top of everything Mr. Market throws your way.  It would be worth loading just for the stock tracking, which gives you access to info from exchanges all over the world - I loaded a few HK Exchange securities that Yahoo just couldn't display.  The news section is equally brilliant, featuring real stories from Bloomberg Media, not endless reprinted press releases.  A Must Have!"
721,Domainsidekick.com,"September 17, 2008",5,"Awesome This works great. Don't know what ""intrusive ads"" people are talking about. The screen is clear and info easily accessable. I have the stocks I follow on the home screen, and one click gives me the history and the latest news feed specifically about that company. Bloomberg updates its news stories constantly throughout the day, and keeps me up to the minute on breaking news. Can't believe it's free. First thing in the morning I grab my iPhone, my coffee, and click Bloomberg. I highly recommend this so"
722,Dred242,"July 9, 2009",1,"Needs more work! This app looks great on the surface but needs a little work under the hood. When running this app on my iPod Touch (2nd Gen), I find it's ability to update market/stock information extremely slow and at least 70% of the time fails completely. I also find the search feature to be somewhat broken. Searches based on company names is hit & miss at best whereas the iPod Touch's built-in stock app finds what I'm looking for every time under the same conditions. I'll grant you that the app looks slick and when functioning correctly offers up a wealth of info unlike any other. But I need a fully functioning app that's there when I need it. When the next version appears I'll try again, but for now Bloomberg Mobile gets a FAIL!"

I used to listen to the live tv in the background while I worked, now that option is gone I have no reason to use the app. I also tried to use my XfinityTV app to see if I could stream their channel from there... Nope! Looks like Bloomberg Didn't give Comcast the rights to stream when you're not on your home network.... what a bummer. I'd rather just use their website if I want to read articles, as navigation on the new app is atrocious. It's especially funny to me they even removed live radio, but instead have a ""radio"" section with a bunch of clips.... 🙄"

Up to this point, I have been fairly happy with the app. It used to be easy to see all the important points, my portfolio and even to do some quick sorting and analysis. Now? It is a total waste of screen and memory space! I think you got taken to the cleaners by an app developer. I will give ""B"" about a week before I just go to a web-based site like Money or BigCharts.

The removal of dark mode is an error as well, it used to do much easier to see and very much in keeping with the Bloomberg terminal. I am now going to start looking for a new app to use to track my stocks as this updated version is not user friendly at all. Bloomberg dropped the ball on this one."
728,Bye bye Bloomberg,"December 15, 2016",1,"AWFUL!!!! I use this app daily to monitor markets and my portfolio.  Today to my great distress the app had been automatically ""updated"" to a slick media rich but terrible white background format that eliminated many of the analysis tools and information items I regularly used in favor of a displaying lot of media content and advertising with only a cursory listing of my stocks (that I could get from any basic app).  Bloomberg has let its loyal users down by eliminating this previously valuable tool with a terrible replacement in an attempt at revenue generation via advertising.  They will FAIL if no one uses the revised app.  As soon as I'm done writing this review, I will begin my search for a replacement app that provides the information I need.  Bye bye Bloomberg!!!"
729,de Schnack,"December 15, 2016",1,"From best to worst My favorite news app is gone with this update, pretty much rendering it useless for me. The  beauty of the old app was it had all the news I wanted and all the news I didn't know I wanted in one place. I kept discovering new topics pretty much every day. Now, all news are categorized and reading across categories means switching back and forth between screens, deciding first what I want to read (which sometimes I don't know until I see something I want to read!), and the screens themselves have turned into a confused mess. From layout to color choices. It looks like a trash news site, and we have plenty of these already. If you wanted to instantly destroy your user base, well done, you accomplished your goal."
730,HopeThisHelps,"July 15, 2008",4,"Crash I too experienced a crash when I added a stock.  After some testing I found that if you delete the apple ticker from the stock list first and then try to add a new ticker, it crashes.  However, after I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I left the apple ticker in the list and added a new stock and discovered that it doesn't crash.  And yes, for you conspiracy theorists out there, you can delete the apple ticker from the list at that point.  I think its a cool app for 1.0, just wish they would have tested it more before releasing it.  For now, though, I give it a 4."
731,FuriousLog,"August 16, 2008",5,"Great App, but some issues... No doubt that the application is solid with respect to UI and data provision. However, it does crash on occasion when adding stocks (as has previously been reported). One infuriating thing is that it will not find certain stocks when using search, where the website has no problem with this at all. I'd give it five stars if it did not have this issue. Persistent ""unknown error"" displays accompany this problem. Not useful in its current state. With fixes, it would be truly excellent."
732,Captain Custerdome,"September 19, 2008",4,"Great App! I've been comparing this App to the built-in stocks App for the iPhone and have found it to be more useful and it often provides more up-to-date stock quotes.  In addition, the landscape stock charts and the daily financial news stories are a nice bonus.  One feature I'd like to see in future updates would be to have links for each stock that would provide deeper research on a stock - such as analyst ratings, more detailed performance analysis and historical data.  Perhaps even advanced charting with sector and index comparisons, etc.  But for a free App, this one is definitely a winner!"
733,Thee Truth Seeker,"June 2, 2009",2,"Nice and at the same time not very nice App is stable. I enjoy the news. It's free. Lots of information that's nicely organized. However, when trying to access the ""Markets"" or ""My Stocks"" it sometimes takes way too long to download a very small amount of data - 5 minutes. Today it failed to even update. I would blame it on ATT but I could log on to my online broker (via safari) and get some of that info faster so it's not the network causing the delays. I know it's free so who am I to complain. Because it's so nice otherwise that I'm going to keep it even though it frustrates me at times. I've been using this app for about 8 months now albeit different iterations."
734,Zipbow,"June 21, 2009",4,"Good concept. Rooms for improvement The interface is fairly straight forward, and it provides most of the vital information you'd need for checking your portfolios/market news. The historical graph in landscape mode is also a nice touch. But adding stock can be a pain - the stock ticker/name search engine feels laggy and buggy, and many stock news failed to include tables or graphs, making the articles themselves incomplete and, to some extend, useless. But then again, this is a free app. One can only hope they'd fix these problems in a future update."

The home button on iPhone takes you back to homescreen no problem, but this Bug should've been caught before release. Will uninstall, but will give them a 2nd chance with next update, as previous versions are helpful when you want to take a quick overview of markets etc."

Perhaps the best investment/market tracking mobile app out there.  One glaring problem it has, though, seems to be its instability.  Whilst trying to add a stock to ""My Stocks"", the program has been crashing on me.  Also, on occasion, even launching Bloomberg crashes my iPhone completely, as in, makes the phone OS restart.

The new version also hides the P&L, position, and cost data inside the individual stocks info, so one can no longer easily track those informatiion in a column format like before.

I would rather pay for a version of the app that provides moderate improvement than have the consistently degrading updates in exchange for the collection of my data.

This didn't happen overnight; it took a few updates, where the programmers threw any considerations for speed out the window. In favor of what, I don't know.

I don't want to see videos about cars when I'm trying to look at oil prices!

The same ad keeps popping up and worst yet it doesn't always respond well when trying to close it and will end up taking you to the advertised page instead. 
758,MuniBanker,"December 14, 2016",5,"Oh my word What used to be clean, tight and precise has lost its way. First, the icon is very close to the UPenn logo. Odd for a Harvard grad. And the spinning B during a search?  Would be great for Bitcoin? Was able to follow muni market data with no hitches. Now it lost graphs, historical prices and the HUGE AD IN THE MIDDLE was hard to get around. And you swipe and swipe and swipe and swipe to read something you may want to see.  Hopefully someone will fix this and get it back on track."
759,matthewtfrank,"January 9, 2017",1,Terrible Update - App Ruined This app was amazing prior to November 2016. The December 2016 update ruined so many great features including the ability to listen to Bloomberg Radio when the app was closed or the phone goes to sleep. 
760,Bill...,"August 2, 2008",4,"Great App, does exactly what I was looking for Fast updates, easy navigation, uncomplicated.  Great features such as the large price chart (when you rotate the iPhone) that can display multiple time periods for individual stocks and the world indicies.  Easy access to related company news on the individual stock pages and industry movers and stock leaders/laggers on the indicies pages.  Easy and quick access to news stories.  One minor bug with the World Markets omits/jumbles the markets and regions until the update is finished."
761,ZamZooma,"September 18, 2008",5,"Why is there a CLOWN on the left Monitor? I love this app!!! I can get my business news in an instant, and it's only the really relevant news.  And the graphing features are amazing.  But I think the publisher should talk the the developers and ask them why on earth there is a clown's face in the left monitor on the start up image.  I know I'm not seeing things because i've showed it to a number of people.  Is this a gag by the developer, or is a laughing clown a symbol of Bloomberg?"

764,j-pon,"October 4, 2013",3,"Nice update but could be better The latest update is more beautiful and has more information than the  previous version. Moving away from all-black to a more elegant dark grey theme is a welcome change. However, the new interaction design could be easier to use. The UI should not get in the way of using the app. The menu and header should be smaller and yield space for content. One suggestion: get rid of the auto-collapsing menu and make it always visible. The current bar does't serve much purpose except for the logo and to invoke collapsing menu."

It's good for monitoring the overall market in stocks, commodities, bonds, and currencies.  It's also the best for monitoring individual stocks.  I like the news also, that you can receive through push notifications, it's timely and mostly business focused.  Some of the updates have had issues but it's still a great app."
767,Uncle Grandma,"September 26, 2014",4,"Great, but needs one thing ! It's a great App, however, funds should be set to 0 for gain/loss at the beginning of each day. Otherwise, your App is providing results from the previous day (during the day before the market closes) because you are retaining old information. I have brought this to your attention many times, but nothing is being done about it. Why am I the only person who cites this issue? How can I add an entry with a $ figure to be used for the total?"

I've also tried deleting and reinstalling, rebooting, etc., to no avail. Glad to see it isn't just me, but wish Bloomberg would fix ASAP.  This used to be my go-to financial news and stock tracking app, but it's useless if I have to manually look up every stock I'm tracking!!!"
769,OptimisticinSG,"March 7, 2017",1,"From best to worst - please listen This app used to be my go-to app and Bloomberg's now destroyed it in its current version.  I don't mind the very intrusive ads (they need to monetise their content) but now the watch lists are impossible to use, providing so little useable info that I've had to shift over to Yahoo Finance.  And the watch list (containing data accumulated since the launched the iOS app many years ago) cannot now be edited because I have too many watchlists (actually only have one).  Bloomberg please listen to your users and give us back the old version; I might even pay for a small subscription, say $0.99 a month for the previous app."
770,andywhoa,"July 13, 2008",4,"Now I can see how much money I'm losing everywhere I go! This app is working great for me.  The UI is very slick and it has a lot of really nice features.  Here's my ownly gripe: When you are viewing a stock you can turn the phone sideways and see a bigger graph of the stock's performance.  You have a menubar that gives you the ability to format the graph based on time (1 year, 6 months, etc...).  My problem is that this bar goes away after a few seconds and I cannot get it back."
771,Crabby Bastard,"February 24, 2009",5,"Quit crying already! I complained also, but IT'S FIXED!!!  Check your updates and quit crying.  Before the update with the glitch this was the best professional app available.  The latest update fixed the problem with the app not opening and it is still the best app available.  Wipe your eyes, download the latest update (you will not lose your stock picks) and quit acting like babies.  The boy's fixed it!  Now give it a deserving review."
772,Carlos259,"May 10, 2009",4,"Good, but can be improved Being an avid Finance-geek and a new investor, I think this app is great: You can filter which news you want to show on the news page (worldwide/top/economy etc.), track a portfolio, view graphs, and see lots of market data. All this is presented in a very user-friendly UI, seemingly native to the iPhone. My only gripe with this app is its loading time: sometimes (especially over Edge) it takes _too_ long for all the data to download. Other than that, this app is great."
773,K-Lean,"October 13, 2013",5,"Great news application The Bloomberg app has a great mix of news, the selection of articles are relevant, informative, and without great bias. Additionally, Bloomberg usually breaks financial news about 1-2 days before most other outlets. The app is easy to navigate, and the features regarding stock market data are great. After trying some other apps to receive news, the Bloomberg app is now the only one I use. Highly recommend."
774,Notaluddite,"October 23, 2013",2,Prior version great; what happened with new version? I loved the old version and had organized my newsfeeds to reflect my business and personal interests.

The ability to see long-term profit and loss, along with daily gains, was easily done on a single page. They have updated the watch list so that it only shows one days activity on any holding on primary watchlist page, and there are seems to be no way to alter the settings. That, along with the really irritating ad layout - think ads being formatted as news stories in each section's primary feed - makes Bloomberg, previously my most commonly opened app – about to be deleted."

First being that I would like to have the capability to see actual stock volumes like you can see the prices on the charts. This was a feature of the app prior to the update. Secondly I would like to see charts for the individual commodities just like the charts for stocks. Overall though it is a great app. I would give 5 stars if it had the two capabilities above.

It worked well. My wife would be livid, but I see that app icon more than my wedding ring. Thanks. Keep striving to make it better by the minute."

You will drive us to other financial information sources. (I already have downloaded a different app.)  I used to start my day by opening up the Bloomberg app.  Not now!  It will be interesting to see if you will be willing to listen to the overwhelming negative response."
790,Sir Hollow,"September 8, 2008",5,Best free app By far in my opinion this is the best free app that I have seen. It gives you all kinds of info espesically things I would need being a active trader. It has a lil 15 min delay bit other than that it is great you can check all kinds of stocks and look at the overseas markets.. I have even created my portfolio on this app so it's very easily in my hand. And I could see my stocks anytime with click of a button

I was hoping to find an app that greatly improved upon the built-in app but this didn't offer any real reason to keep it on the phone. I don't care for the colors either, which isn't a big deal but having it not be pleasing to the eye is a strike against it as well. Maybe I was hoping for too much, but there was no ""Oh Wow!"" factor to make me instantly see why this would be a good replacement for the OEM stock app. Nothing wrong with it really, just no reason to have it when I already have an easy way to check stocks."

798,ID Finance Expert,"December 14, 2016",1,"Worst update ever! What were you guys thinking? This is the worst update ever in the history of the entire App Store. Whoever did the research and development on this update should be fired immediately. Your auto sizing is completely off, your navigation is poor, and the icons are not clear. I'm sure your team is saying 'it just takes time to get used to it', wrong. It is poor human factors design for a small screen and is not usable. I have used this app 20+ times a day forever, I am switching to a new finance app. How did this update ever make it out of research and quality control? You used to have a great app. No longer."

Also, I used to be able to stream video to Chromecast but that functionality was also taken away.

If you want to give us a new UI at least make it intuitive. Better yet, bring back the old version.

Now, watch list info is on different screens so have to constantly go back and forth, back and forth...for each stock.  Yikes!

The app does not update properly and is stagnant for hours if not days and the layout is more cumbersome. For example I watch the price of oil regularly and I have to visit other sites in order to see the current pricing. I do like the font size and background colors which are easier to read. Why isn't it updating properly??"

I loved the Market Watch feature, along with the portfolio tracking tool.  The upgraded app is a watered down version of the original, meant for phone sized screen. The visual aspects are colorful & branded to match their update website.  Unfortunately both are poorly designed in terms of actual content and clearly not designed by anyone with an interest or understanding of financial markets. I am done this app....looking for one that takes investing serious to switch to!"

828,Kurtrva,"February 10, 2017",1,"This Bloomberg app is so bad it even makes their propaganda look good. I agree with the other guy that Bloomberg needs to keep his political opinions to himself and stick to reporting the news. I mainly used the last edition for the portfolio widget and got my news from less biased sources, however this edition stopped that. This version is far less user friendly and that was the straw that broke the camels back for me. Seriously though why do all these self righteous smug billionaires always try so hard to push their liberal views? Don't they realize if Bernie Sanders or the like were to ever get elected they could kiss most of that money goodbye?"

830,BusyBub,"July 13, 2008",4,"Excellent, but still needs a few tweaks. Much better than the iPhone's default stock app, but it does occasionally crash when viewing price charts.  Also, I would like to see the option of projecting price data using candlesticks rather than the basic closing line chart.  All of the data necessary for that (high, low, open, close) is available, they just need to allow you to graph it differently."

833,JrFromQueens,"November 26, 2008",4,"Great for a free financial App! I like this app a lot, I wish it was faster though, the defualt Stock app on the iPhone is much faster. Also it let's you track your stocks but doesn't show the total loss or gains according to your share holdings and original purchase price. If it was faster and adjusted the 'My Stocks' section to have the ability to show stocks based on the change from your original purchase price this would be a great app!"

Great reporting, nice editorials and the ability to customize your experience is a really cool feature. If you're into the markets, you can even get news specific to your investments. That said, like others have reviewed, the alerts are pretty pointless since they don't open the article they are alerting you to."

The new watchlist only supports day gain and price vs the old one that supported a wide variety of data(10+) fields. Space utilization/design is horrible. The new version makes it so that you can't go more than a screen without seeing obtrusive ads. I guess it's time to move on and find a better stock watchlist/info app. I wish I had never updated this app :(. I would PAY $$ to go back to the older version of this app"

What is entertaining once gets annoying when played the 20th time in a row and by 50 you hate the product. And the advertiser. And this App. I used to listen 3-4 hours a day. My HOOKED app tells me do but no more. I am actively looking for ways to replace Bloomberg as my source of business news. You don't have a competitor YET but you will and then it adios. Already I'm doing something else with my time. I appreciate the ads when they come at a reasonable clip but at the beginning of EVERY clip. Very annoying. Infuriating.

With the last couple of updates, you must download each article as you access them.  I was about to settle in and read the news on the Bloomberg app on a 12 hour flight obviously with no internet only to find none of the stories had downloaded!

In this latest update Bloomberg included fly and dine modules. Are those really more critical than ticker news alerts and  company Events module? Not to mention I can't even retrieve a very lengthy news history on a company. Remind me again why I am paying so much extra $$$ per month for a Bloomberg anywhere capability???
852,mcc745,"January 6, 2014",4,"One of the best apps for business news....but Use it almost every day. My only issue is the number of stocks in the watch list. I have about 60 stocks in the portfolio and at least 60 more in the watch list and I can't have them all. Also, new app now shows them alphabetically. I used to list them by sector so I could see who was moving more or less by sector. Now I can't tell. Other than that. Great app."

This newest update immediately caused some serious slowness with my whole phone, and the bloomberg app was more non responsive then ever. So despite getting crucial global market data I deleted it and my phone is running better. I will probably have to reinstall, but after causing me so much trouble on a brand new iphone, I will try to avoid his however possible. Terrible. I've never reviewed anything because nothing is this bad... After 4 years, it's now total junk."

857,BENZIONHERSHBERG,"July 16, 2014",4,"Bloomberg news The app is chock full of timely, accurate information. It also is easy to use. My only problem with the app is that it sometimes is slow to load and update on my iPhone 4s.

I'm a business student and I can't express how essential and important the Bloomberg App is to staying on pulse with the global business environment and specific industries. I'm the most informed person in my discussion because of it and a better business mind for it. Lovely lovely lovely. I would suggest the magazine in addition to the app too! Bloomberg Businessweek and the app really reenforce one another.
867,Alex Hogge,"September 6, 2014",5,"Extremely Well Done I downloaded the Bloomberg app from a friends recommendation about a week ago.

There's too much white space, requiring constant scrolling and the ads are enormous.

The behavior stills exists:  when user clicks on news story, as the news story loads, you are automatically redirected to a inert web address and when user requests to go back to app, the app is again redirected to inert web address (a vicious loop) making reading the news story impossible.

I've never used the Blackberry version, but this iPhone version is my favorite app and I'm glad Bloomberg took a shot at developing for the iPhone. I think their efforts will be rewarded with improved brand recognition and ultimately driving traffic to other Bloomberg properties."
904,W_G,"February 15, 2009",5,"Version 2.0.5 update is problematic but seems to work once you reset everything. As people are saying, delete the application with probably its preference files.  Then download the app.  Then add back My Stocks, News Headlines (under edit in that section) and fiddle with the Markets.  Just wish Bloomberg had mentioned this under What's New."
905,sprmcm,"March 1, 2015",1,Terrible redesign Update:  the only surprising thing is that they haven't realized the redesign is a disaster.  Or they think people will get used to it.  We won't.
906,jeffreytstarr,"September 26, 2016",1,"Notification to Nowhere I'm a long time user of the Bloomberg app and had been very happy with the interface, the performance and features. With the latest update (Sep '16), I no longer have a working app.  I discovered this when clicking on a Bloomberg notification I had just received. The app crashed while trying to open. Deleting the app and reinstalling provided no improvement. If and when the app returns to functional with the same performance as it had prior to this recent update, it would be 5-star worthy; right now....zero."
907,DeepSeaDiverNY,"March 1, 2017",1,"What the heck were they thinking, this app is terrible Why would anyone want to upgrade to this app.  What use to be a very good app that allowed me to check on commodity prices and look at historical prices in a chart as well as for equities now has zero functionality.  Do not waste your time with this app, plus they are forcing everyone to update not allowing us to just keep the old version.  I am deleting the app because there are so many better apps available.  Why even waste their money or time developing this crappy, useless app."
908,Zipusee,"March 31, 2017",1,"I miss the old Bloomberg, straight from the Go Bloomberg This app itself admittedly delivers better quality videos, more reliably, and quicker. But now most of the videos that it delivers are ads! Ads are everywhere in this new version of the app. Moreover, as as avid video watcher you can no longer minimize the video to audio only to browse article or listen on the go. Every since the update the app eats a tremendous amount of data also. "

Downloaded and installed version 2.0 with multilanguage support and the application will no longer start.  It will cycle from home screen, attempt to start and back to home screen again.  I did a ""power off"" cycle of the iTouch with no result. I have deleted version 2.0 and reinstalled version 1.5 until this problem is patched."
911,Punchypowie,"October 6, 2013",5,"They really outdid themselves here. Everything seems so much more sleek, new, and fast. Adding positions is so much more easy and now I can actually look at the fundamentals of the companies that are on my watch list in a simple, quick chart. Awesome. They completely remade their buggy app from before for the better."
912,Chicago diner,"October 18, 2013",4,"Perfect for Streaming TV I use the app to get Live Bloomberg TV, and it works perfectly for that purpose. I need my fix each morning & night! Although, I will say after a couple if years, it would be nice to get new music during the TV commercial breaks... But it will be hard to top the current composition because it has just the right amount of subtlety and variety."
913,drt_in,"February 24, 2014",5,"Nice product! This app provides exactly what I need: A quick look into the day's market activities, news stories, and an update on my watch list of stocks.

915,Mark i3,"June 7, 2014",5,"Great overall app This is a great app for overall news content, market data and info, and easy access to video content. A recent version added the audio only option which is ideal - saving on data bandwidth/usage while I stream Bloomberg TV and listen to it on my drive to work. Great app."
916,RPGeez,"March 4, 2015",2,"Streaming is broken First, I love Bloomberg news (I'm a subscriber to the magazine and have paid extra for cable just to have it), and because of that I want to be with it all day. That being said, in this new version of the app every time I close the app, or even if I leave it open and my phone screen goes off, the video streaming ends to my TV/Chromecast. I don't think this was an issue in the previous version. Please revisit this function quickly so I can stay informed and happy."
917,MarketClown,"April 21, 2016",3,"Good and Bad The app is great based on the live TV feature alone but the advertising is obnoxious on other functions of the app. I would suggest filling the commercial breaks on the live stream with actual commercials instead of elevator music and reducing the ads in other parts of the app. Also, the commercials that play between the rerun videos are all the same, come on... Not the quality I'm used to but nevertheless, still Bloomberg."
918,AndHesGone,"December 25, 2016",1,"Appalled I don't ordinarily write reviews but I have to say this to people thinking about downloading this app: DON'T. Like other mentioned, this app used to be very functional like the terminal itself, with a great news section that you could browse by selected area, and also an impressive market data section (impressive by phone standards at least). That has been completely thrown out the window. Developers, if you're reading this, please revert to the previous version and just maintain that, as it worked incredibly well."
919,mrg4guy,"February 21, 2017",1,"Not Optimized and Overly Simplistic The old app was wonderfully optimized to maximize the information displayed and allowed for multitasking. This new app looks terrible on an iPad as it has huge white borders on each side of the content. Additionally, the user is forced to access multiple pages to see the same information that was all available on the old app. "

Since both my jobs don't allow me the convenience of sitting in front of a computer, I use this app to constantly monitor oil prices and stock quotes even while driving(don't do this at home kids!?). I also like reading the News Headlines and finding suddenly dirt cheap stocks in the Stock Finder."

926,Veganscript,"December 15, 2016",1,"Terrible. If I wanted so many steps, I'd get a stair master Next to Gmail (whose update was also terrible), this was my most used app and will now also be deleted. Now there are multiple steps to try to find the news you're looking for, and the terrible white color (following Google's terrible update are you?), is so obtrusive and annoying I would rather scratch my eyes out. Another set of designers who appear to design a product without consulting any focus group who actually use the product. Time to look for a new app. Goodbye"
927,K Greer,"December 18, 2016",1,"Update is very bad All the useful data and side bars are now gone, and the white background is just horribly strenuous on your eyes. Landscape view on an iPad for example gives you a narrow column of text in the middle flanked by an expansive and blinding whiteness. It's also extremely difficult to tell in the main menu which items are articles and which are ads, and is very frustrating and discouraging when all I want is quick access to the news and top stories. "
928,verdi,"January 16, 2017",4,"I actually like the update... Initially the update really bugged me, but I got used to the new navigation pretty quick. I like having all of the sub-sections available via the search button; my only two complaints are the move from a black background to a white one (harsher on the eyes in low light) and the continued lack of chromecast capability in the video section."
929,NW Reader,"January 30, 2017",1,"Spectacularly Awful - Amateurish, Ugly, Loss of Functionality If there were any way to avoid this ""upgrade"" (more like wholesale destruction), I would advise you not to upgrade.  However, it appears you can't avoid any longer (old version disabled behind an upgrade message on my iPad).  So this is really for the Bloomberg people: [imagine the worst set of expletives you ever hoped not to hear] - I hope you step in dog turds and track it all over your house. Why-oh-why would you destroy the look and feel of the actual BB terminal in favor of this useless circus?"

931,DRMRJ,"December 11, 2010",1,UPDATE RENDERED THIS APP USELESS TO ME I usually wait for reviews before updating.  In this case I did not.  Big mistake.  The update indicated it was providing minor enhancements and bug fixes.  Bloomberg clearly misrepresented what they were offering.
932,Dankot,"March 19, 2012",5,Uninstall and reinstall..it works! Hey fellow reviewers.. I would like to make a change on my previous review..I simply uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked! Bloomberg should have checked this though..no excuses for that. Anyway for those of you who need to get it working..here's your solution. Using an iPhone 4 on 5.0.1.
933,Wolvocarlo,"February 19, 2014",5,"This just keeps getting better This is the single best one stop financial app.  Live TV, quotes, news, market data, and Bloomberg does it better than anyone else.  They keep finding ways to make improvements, and they incorporate feedback quickly, so I don't look anywhere else."
934,arvimide,"February 24, 2014",3,"Helpful Improvements, But... Confined to only one portrait view, without a landscape view alternative, it is still a clumsy app to use. But the increased number of currencies and stock markets to survey is a substantial improvement. It would be helpful to be able to go backward as well as forward in checking individual items. The increased number of news stories immediately on offer is an undisputable improvement."
935,FON1943,"December 15, 2016",5,Gone from good to bad! This new app version is real bad. With the last version I could enter base price and see my told gain/lost for a specific stock. Look at 52 week highs/lows for it. Not anymore. And now there are large ads interspersed through out my portfolio list. Bloomberg had a good portfolio listing app and made it totally worthless.
936,Zoomey,"December 19, 2016",1,"Last update ruined the application The new update has completely ruined the application. The display does not use the entire iPad landscape, the articles are difficult to read and find and the watch lists show far less information at a glance than before. Additionally, navigation is poor. You can not get back from a stock chart to the stock information without exiting and restarting the application. A useless application in its present form. What was one of my favorites has now been deleted."
937,Larrybobba,"February 7, 2017",5,"Terrible All the negative feedback here is very well deserved.  The previous version was very good. Unfortunately, this new version simply dos not provide the data I want to see summarized on one page in watchlist. I asked tech support and was told it is no longer available.  It simply makes no sense."
938,Indy Samra,"February 10, 2017",1,"Disappointed in latest update The latest update, which I assume was meant to enhance the user experience, is a complete miss.  The previous version appeared well on both iPad and iPhone, however, this version appears only for iPhone and therefore is not a good fit for iPad users.  "
939,Stuedma,"July 23, 2017",1,"Shocking product from Bloomberg Having used Bloomberg professional for over 12 years at my last job, I expected their usually high technical standards to show on this free app.  I'm shocked at how poor it is.  Bugs everywhere, impossible to use User interface, labels not showing up on chart axis, etc. etc.   a litany of problems.  I know Bloomberg can do better, so I have to concur with other reviewers here that they must be letting this app die on the vine.  Really disappointed.  Look elsewhere for a finance app, this isn't it."
940,Purdue Mike,"December 1, 2008",5,Works off line! This app is fantastic! Once you update the news field (done automatically) the articles can easily be read even without an Internet connection; a definite save for battery life. The black background and white text also preserves the battery.
941,Btvfan,"August 28, 2012",1,Do not download Good news feed. Terrible terrible terrible refresh time. If you are looking for up-to-date info Yahoo's app is by far superior. Just to check the major indices with this app it usually takes 8-10 minutes (several attempts b/c request times out 3 or four times).  News feed I would give 5 stars. Everything else in this app I.e. stock quotes and market data (the reason I downloaded it in the first place I give 0 stars. There are much better financial apps for free out there. This one is just a disappointment.

947,gmessier,"September 24, 2014",3,"Some minor shortcomings With the latest update they took away the time stamp for the price on each security.  A MAJOR detraction from the prior version.

I am going to move from two stars to three."

Also, is there a way to have the time the data was taken on the same line instead having it part of the changable field at the end.

954,3737KAK,"July 18, 2014",4,Alkhalili Khalid An essential daily app for me. I enjoy it a lot and prefer it over the competing apps. The analysis is really dynamic and descriptive. It's a must if you enjoy business news.

Also the number of ads increased and many of the ads cover parts of the articles making them unreadable. Many ads are too sensitive and attempted scrolling past them activates another unwanted web page.
959,J Dog1945,"December 14, 2015",5,"Good for in depth news, less for good investment info Bloomberg provides high quality journalism with a sleek, approachable format.

Great app and next best thing to having a terminal of your own.
969,ByeBloombergApp,"January 20, 2017",5,Last update ruined this app The Bloomberg app has been my main source of news for years. The update a few weeks ago made me stop using it.

970,NYSocks,"February 19, 2009",5,"Really slick... This is really miles above the default stocks app on the iphone. The charting is very close to what I would see on the full Bloomberg but apparently the app crashes. I tried to add a variety of stocks to try to crash the app but it didnt crash.

972,Keep Updated Coming!!,"April 20, 2013",2,"News Alerts Bloomberg has recently changed its 'News Alerts.' Previously, I found the Bloomberg alerts to be a source for useful information, now, the alerts are simply petitions to 'Watch Live' and have become much less helpful and more frequent.

Please offer a way to modify alerts or I will likely delete this app and use an alternative source for my business news."
973,Dlw2222,"October 4, 2013",5,Bloomberg iOS 7.0 It only took about a minute for me to navigate through the new design of this app.  It is easy to use and I like the various sections are listed at bottom of the app. It is organized and I do not need to get out from one section in order to get into another section.  Great app. Love it.
974,Szubham,"November 9, 2013",4,Wondering why so many people are disappointed I think this app is a fine creation. They are saying it's too cluttered. I think provides all the info. Like the watch list option in news tab providing you all the latest news about assets in your watch list. All the prices are there. Color combination used is good. Loving it
975,Cmetcal,"January 12, 2014",5,Very nice This is a really nice app. It has all the financials I like to look at in 1 convenient place. Only downside is I do wish it would automatically factor in dividends. Couldn't see taking off a whole star for that. It's the best of all my financial apps and I have about 5 and have tried about 10.

977,theskipper1953,"December 14, 2016",1,"Not Good I have been in the investment business for over 30 years but have never seen a software update that effectively reduces its appeal and  effectiveness from prior versions.  The latest Bloomberg mobile update is visually less appealing, requires far more user involvement to find what was easily available on one screen in prior versions, and seems unprofessional, as if the user is a child, not someone that can view more than one topic at a time.  Too bad.  I'm deleting from all devices and going elsewhere"
978,M in Pennsylvania,"February 18, 2017",1,"Terrible.  Update ruined this app. Bloomberg had a useful, easy to navigate app that I used daily to monitor the markets, individual stocks and other investments.  It worked well on both iPad and iPhone.  Then users were forced to update, and the update is awful, especially on an iPad.  Most data can't be accessed in landscape mode.  The most annoying change is that I can't add to my watchlist, and get a message pushing Bloomberg Professional, which requires a Bloomberg Terminal subscription.  Not realistic for individual investors."
979,Samberaldof,"March 9, 2017",1,"Fire who developed this version The app was one of the best to follow your stocks. Instead improving only the design and fixing bugs, they changed the whole concept of it. Before the change it was possible to know the total gain, daily gain and so much more. Now it is only daily gain. It lacks a better overview. In addition to all this, I have stocks in Brazil and the summary show the value in dollars."

It crashes after trying to download index data. I was never able to see index data. Tried with both Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G.  Apple's Stocks application is much better and faster.

986,Oyetayo,"May 18, 2014",3,Great App. Bad App The problem with this app is the fact that when breaking news hits and bloomberg alerts me it does not go into the actual article written!!!! Drives me nuts - have to fix that guys.
987,Former Bloomberg Raving Fan,"January 4, 2017",1,"New App Update is Worthless Bloomberg needs to fire whichever marketing execs suggested they ""update"" their apps.  The new version is completely worthless.  I've used every finance app in the industry.  Bloomberg WAS the best.  Now, it is worthless.  They need to roll back this update to the last version.  If they don't, they can kiss all their ad revenue goodbye.  It's clear enough from these reviews that the ""update"" was a huge mistake.  I can't wait to read the case study in HBR of how Bloomberg blew it with this update.  A perfect example of what not to do."
988,BuSaBumNim,"February 3, 2017",1,"Once a terrific app, now ruined by idiots I wish I could give this app negative stars.  The old app was laid out perfectly.  It was functional, and easy to navigate.  The new app?  You have to scroll for everything.  You can't click on an index or a stock's performance on a given day.  I was refusing to delete the old version as THIS version is about as useless as a tablet without a charge, but now they've locked me out of the old version with constant pop ups. The February 3 version is no better."

991,Kelly for world peace,"October 26, 2013",5,"Outstanding There is always a trade between ease of use and functionality. Bloomberg figured it out. Can easily navigate, intuitive, and highly functional. If you want a simpler interface, you will trade away information and analytical. "

The first outlet I reach to via the internet is Bloomberg . I do use their platform at work as well, excellent for my open source needs."
993,Mahdi Hemingway,"March 16, 2014",5,"I didn't think it could get better!! I love this App! Before the update, I constantly used this app for commodity news. Bloomberg has now become my primary source of financial information because of this app-- the website and tv (available on the site) are awesome!"
994,Lefty_86,"June 12, 2015",4,Great app! Love the chromecast support! The app functions well and I'm able to easily switch between the sections. The best feature is chromecast support for the live stream of Bloomberg. Other news outlets must follow or be left in the past. Especially for us cord cutters the car feature is necessary. Thanks for listening and adding those features.
995,Dlespera,"September 7, 2015",2,"Technical glitches ruin experience Bloomberg has great content, but technical glitches ruin the reading experience. Pages often fail to load, or crash when attempting to reload.  Too many of the stories automatically link to video, which will not play when iPhone or iPad is connected to a slow network. Videos often play sound even when iPad is set to mute, which can be embarrassing ."
996,Lobster roll,"December 1, 2015",1,"New version is horrible! Unbelievably bad. Automatically goes to safari for ads I DIDN'T click on. Widget doesn't update SPX price. Basically, a horribly maintained app. Use a different app for news; you'll be less frustrated. "
997,cmb1978,"December 15, 2016",1,"Terrible! How do I revert to old app?? This is so much worse than the old app that I don't even know where to begin. It's full of gigantic repeating ads, the watchlists disappear and is generally confusing, the navigation is complex and photo intensive which does not work well in an iPhone (small screen) where you really just want to find the most relevant news, easily. Bloomberg, please get rid of this terrible update or let us go back to the old version which I think many people liked"
998,JanOlaf,"January 16, 2017",1,"Used to be the best app, now it's useless I am so bummed this app was changed making it a useless app. I am crossing my fingers that the team get the message and bring back the old app. If not I will just erase it. I keep it on my phone for one reason; waiting for the update to come bringing it back to the way it was. Hardly any news on here and no easy access to market data. And I have not even written about the iPad app version which is literally the same as the iPhone version. Useless app in current state"
999,T cheezy,"January 20, 2017",1,"Extremely sad update This is by far the worst update I've seen in recent memory. Prior to this update, I would open the app up in the morning to get my latest news so I can read on the train where there is no internet connection. Now, after the upgrade, I am unable to read the news offline. It says there is no internet connection. So whatever they did, the ability to read the articles offline is no longer there. The app is totally useless to me now."

1001,Chuck ffffff,"February 17, 2009",5,Great app This app is great for getting market information. Way better in my opinion than the standard stocks app. One improvement would be a TOTAL function at the top of the portfolio screen so you could quickly see how the aggregate market value of your positions is performing.
1002,taimerov,"June 30, 2009",5,"Excellent Application with an advice Very practical application. I use everyday. One more thing I'd like to have is the ""% P&L"" on the ""My Stocks"". Only ""P&L"" is not helpful enough. Profit compare to the capital would be more information to decide. The formula would be easy, (market value - bought value)/bought value. Thanks for such great application."
1003,Wolf04,"December 10, 2011",5,"Works flawlessly What I love most about this app is that it gives you updates almost real time. Easy to look up other stocks, read news articles, see data trends, and user friendly customization. This is by far the best stock app for the iPhone."
1004,Hlyork,"October 17, 2013",4,Getting better I really like this app as a quick way to find out what might be happening when markets move. I also like the way notifications are limited to the very interesting.

1007,TravPerk,"February 5, 2017",3,"Getting better. The Bloomberg app was so much better before they changed it! I miss the old dark theme and being able to control the size of the text of the articles. I'm glad that at least this update fixed the stupid font size issue! But it still needs some work. This new app could be great, Bloomberg just has to put some real effort into it!"
1008,Eagle235,"February 13, 2017",1,"What a waste for any advertiser Not only is this a loss of a quality application, it's a lie to any advertiser wasting their money on this cheap piece of junk.  Any user that was worth anything, an investor, a target for the type of advertisers that are on here, those people are gone. Secondly, since the site looks so second rate and non professional, the advertisers that are on there are assuming the same characteristic, second rate, not worth the time for consideration. Your choice but not worth the time or space, it is being deleted."
1009,Bullheart,"February 22, 2017",5,"Very disappointing I have used professional Bloomberg terminals and previous versions of this app...the app is practically unusable, cumbersome and a step back from the previous versions...the product manager needs to be replaced.  Poor effort from an outstanding organization"
1010,Sk1512,"February 18, 2009",5,Great app - give them a break! Checked reviews to see if there was info about the bug. Disappointed to see people posting 1 star reviews because of a bug that clearly will be fixed soon. Fantastic app. Doesn't deserve bad reviews because of one broken update!

1013,DJamesCustom,"March 3, 2014",5,"Student/Independent Researcher Bloomberg provides factual news coverage with push notifications, among many other services.  As a source of objectively verifiable geopolitical and economic data, it excels.  This app, and company, seems highly valuable to anyone making strategic decisions. I use it daily as part of my ongoing economic research."
1014,GnaRing,"March 4, 2014",5,"Love the app, must have Very powerful app. Great source of information spanning the entire financial and some non-financial areas. Specifically like the news aggregator feature for individual securities. "
1015,Sandy of Coral Gables,"March 25, 2014",5,A great and reliable source of financial information If you're looking for something beyond a lot of opinion and fluff use the Bloomberg app as a centerpiece of your search. This app avoids the noise and narcissism of so much that's on the Internet these days. It provides the solid and eschews the sensational in its financial reporting.  I depend on it.
1016,Bf121,"May 23, 2014",5,Great app I really enjoy the app except the newest update has a glitch and reading some articles shuts down the app
1017,Hellsamok,"August 7, 2014",5,Bloomberg got digital media right The interface is the best of all the news interfaces. With focus Bloomberg is providing me with what i need to start the day. The combo of video/audio/text is phenomenal !

1019,sandymc2,"February 1, 2017",1,"Junk Firstly, functionality is far, far worse than the old app. This is displays about 6 numbers on the whole screen. The old app got way more information on one screen, so you could get a much better snapshot of what's going on in the markets."

1021,James Conway,"August 15, 2008",4,"Great App in need of small additions Beautiful layout for this App and just about all the necessary features. I would recommend the developer making it optional to read articles and view all pages in landscape mode. Also something like a ""Briefcase"" option to save articles would be a great addition."
1022,BMWsite,"September 25, 2008",4,Updates The only way to install the update to the Bloomberg app is to delete the app from my iPhone and reinstall the new version.  The problem is that I have 40 or so stocks loaded in - to I would need to re-enter all the stocks each time the s/w is updated.  This makes the updates more trouble than they're worth...
1023,Marshalldid,"October 17, 2008",2,"Bring back the first version Although I agree with most reviewers that this app provides great info, if you can't access it or it takes too long to load then you really can't enjoy the features. The new version takes way to long to load (if it loads at all). I did not experience these problems with the first version. Please fix asap. I would be happy to pay for this app if it worked consistently."
1024,magnifico1000,"March 2, 2010",5,"Very Nice! This is a great application and it's free. As an index, commodities and futures trader, I sure do like the way this app. is laid out. Quick info. on the run. Completely changed my opinion about Bloomberg. Use to think they were just for stodgy, conservative, buy and hold investor types. This has made me think again!"
1025,dleeper47,"May 19, 2010",4,"Total Portfolio Value missing? Very nicely done, but it appears to be missing a critical feature in ""My Stocks"" tracking.  It does not report the total value of the portfolio.  That's my most important number for a quick check of ""how am I doing?"".  I can't get a feel for that when having to look at 20-25 total positions."
1026,itsmystery,"November 5, 2013",5,"Outstanding content, had a perfect interface Have been using Bloomberg on iPhone for almost five years. Loved the content. The interface before the latest version used the benchmark for other applications. Content is still top notch. UI is cluttered , messy"
1027,EKimball,"February 4, 2014",4,"Good, but I agree with another reviewer who said that the app is good except for two problems. First, it doesn't reorient text and images when I turn the iPhone from portrait to landscape orientation. Second, sometimes when I tap on a new notification, the story is not available yet and I get nothing. Otherwise I do like the app."
1028,OnEMesSduPKiD,"March 14, 2017",1,"Bloomberg officially stinks Bloomberg used to be my go-to news source. But now, between their endless biased news reporting and the revamp of their once-great app, it may be time to move on. I unsubscribed from their magazines and soon will be uninstalled from this app. I tell everyone, Bloomberg news used to be a source that wouldn't interest people that weren't in the financial world due to its technical data and deep analysis of financial news. Now? Now it's 75% politics and the rest is writing on an undergraduate level. "
1029,MVP 5,"July 5, 2017",1,"Please bring back version 3 I keep checking the App Store, hoping they got rid of version 4, but no luck so far. I tried 4.4.1 but it is not good. The watch list is still missing many of the version 3 features that I liked. The watch list only uses 40% of the screen. Some advertisements in the articles take up the entire screen on an iPhone. You have to swipe and hope it slides past to continue reading the article. Such a disappointment this app has become."
1030,mttnrrs,"June 17, 2009",5,Pleasant suprise Was very Suprised when I used this during the market hours today. Excellent and to the point. Unique interface design too. Fix the few little crash bugs and this is golden. 
1031,jservatius,"September 19, 2011",4,"Ok, but needs a better update feature Solid app, but updating is lacking. I have to switch to the Market tab and then back to News to get the headlines to update. Why can't there be a ""pull down to update"" feature like in Facebook or other apps? Very annoying or it would have gotten 5 stars."
1032,StressFreeLC,"October 16, 2013",5,Good app The newest version of this app makes your investment information easier to retrieve. I like being able to see the values games and status of my stocks at any given time. I just have to make sure that I update the stocks on this app whenever I buy or sell.
1033,GregAlDes,"May 9, 2014",5,Useful Tool I love this app. I use it everyday and with each update it seems to become even more useful.  Bloomberg continues to add more features to make the app even more helpful. Bloomberg is certainly my favorite source for the news both finance and general news.
1034,theTennessean,"August 3, 2014",5,Awesome App I'm able to keep up with all the latest market news with push notifications and alerts. Streaming video is excellent and allows me to watch the market open from where ever I might be on my mobile device.

Since the relaunch I never use the site because the type and graphics are so big that you can't navigate the news stories.  On the old app you could quickly review all the current stories, but now it is just an eye sore.  It looks like the lead designer had a background in Japanamation not news.  Forget the cartoons, small print and small or images is preferred."

I followed the reboot procedure for the iPod Touch and it still does the same thing.  I tried removing it, deleteing the .ipa file from the iTunes directory and using the 1.4 version but now it doesn't even synch back on to the ipod.

Classic case of monkey see monkey do as other apps moved to left side menus. They ruined a very fluid navigation system. I mean Bloomberg, isn't your whole motto function over form? It won't change back because I bet whoever made the call to change it isn't a man enough to admit their mistakes."

If you wanted to read about energy the app would filter all energy related stories. If you wanted to read about China it would filter all Chinese related stories. There were dozens of sectors you could choose to follow or not follow. Now the app is a cluster flip of searches, unorganized sectors, mix matched. "
1049,YuriGuy,"August 14, 2017",4,"Good content at least The app itself crashes a lot.  There are plenty of ads but I'm not bothered by them a lot, since they're mostly at the bottom of the screen.

On the watchlist, they have removed the key features of P/L   %/$ for long term.  This bad review isn't about change but more about getting nothing now compared to a million dollar previous app. WTH were you thinking!"
1080,Schneij,"February 16, 2009",5,"Great app (even after the update)! Nice interface, and all the info you need. As it said when you upgrade to 2.0, you need to delete and then reinstall the app. You do lose your saved data, but it works fine once you do this."
1081,BB_Anywhere_user,"April 20, 2009",2,What happened to the News? I am a Bloomberg Anywhere user that expected an improvement over the last version (as the upgrade descrption suggested). Turns out the only notable change vs. prior version was making News feature (which is at least 50% of what I used the app for) much more limited. BRING BACK NEWS TOPICS! This was a great application and can be again. Have deleted it hoping for new version soon...
1082,SnoopDoc,"March 5, 2010",5,"Better than CNBC app, for Traders This little app is something else. I can get access to information on world markets, futures and news. Custom build stock lists. CNBC's app crashes and has almost too much video. When money matters, I can find the info I need to make a trading decision."
1083,Eherby,"May 19, 2010",5,"Fantastic Great Program that I have installed in both iphone and ipad.  If there is a downfall, the data between the two needs to sync. Plus when I get my monthly statement a easy way to enter that months purchases to the current balances. "
1084,Predev1,"February 3, 2014",5,"Great app It is a great app to follow your stocks and to know about the latest news about your stocks. Only think I miss is that there should be two watch lists, one for the one that you already own and other that you are planning to buy."
1085,BlackAcidEX,"February 14, 2014",5,"1 of the Best News App! I love this app. It is always changing with iOS upgrades and it never feels to slow. Also, the news is presented in a clean simple to read formate. Overall get the app even if your not into finance you'll be happy you did."
1086,Joemoso,"March 2, 2014",5,"Bloomberg is very useful I have been using this app ever since it came out and it's very useful to get updated regarding business news. I'm a fan of the bloomberg channel, but recently haven't had time to watch it so I've been on this app on my iPad as well."
1087,The Fly 525,"July 23, 2014",5,"Everything un on location I used to use several apps to check stocks, commodities, financial news, etc. Now, I use only this app. It has everything I want or need in the way of financial news and information."
1088,IAR in MD,"August 25, 2014",5,Best app of its kind I am a financial advisor and planner and this app by far is the best around. I have the ability to get up to date info on all the markets along with specific stocks I am following with a touch and swipe. I have recommended this app to other professionals and my clients.
1089,James Tharayil,"December 16, 2016",5,Research analyst Please go back to the old app. The new one is not good for a avid financial reader like me. Please go back to the old one which is way easier to read and use. I'm a huge fan of Bloomberg but the latest update is disappointing please change
1090,AriChatt,"October 7, 2013",5,Bloomberg's got it right I have been using this app for around 2 years now and I must say that they've made a leap forward in terms of their user interface. The last time I was intrigued by a news app was probably Summly (now dismantled and owned by Yahoo!). Good Job! Bloomberg team.
1091,Thomas Surdyk,"October 16, 2013",5,Review upgrade I preferred the older version. It was less busy. Mostly it was a lot clearer. It is nice to have all the additional information but it unfortunately sacrifices clarity. The bold script of the previous version was nice. If there was a way to embolden the script of this version it would be preferable.
1092,Takkeem from North Philly,"January 9, 2014",5,"My number one source now Since I've discovered the bloomberg app it has been my number one source of news and information especially economic and business news. The live Tv feed is an awesome function, fantastic app!!!"
1093,Richinthenight,"January 24, 2014",5,"24/7 News stories from around the world make this my number one, go-to, source for news.  The reporting leans left, but you can easily look to past to the great content."
1094,Nathan Donsen,"February 26, 2014",5,Great news app I've use many different news apps. I think Bloomberg is by far the best. It provides all of the world news that I want to read about but also covers all of the finance/economic news that others don't cover.
1095,jdpazmino,"May 20, 2014",5,"Well rounded app It has a lot one could make use of. It's not just daily listing of ups or downs in the market, it's all-around very insightful info. I watch the Live Bloomberg TV at work and it makes things so much easier, and financial firm can get pretty boring."
1096,jwdbond,"June 5, 2014",5,Best financial data and news app This app deserves 5 stars because:
1097,4C ent,"December 15, 2016",1,New version is junk I have used Bloomberg for years. They have always been a leader in the financial app market. The watchlist could not be better! But the new version looks like something my 6 year old grandson would make. Why would any company replace the best app with this junk? As bad as yahoo is I am moving to it over this version. If Bloomberg was smart they would bring the old version back and remove everyone that worked on this version!!!!
1098,Paikman,"January 18, 2017",1,"New version is garbage. Useless! I never write reviews, but the recent update to this app has frustrated me enough to complain. It used to be my favorite app and I used the mobile watchlist multiple times a day. It is now much harder to decipher and has significantly less information and flexibility making it useless. I dont know what they were thinking, but I'm now going to delete this garbage app from my phone. Such a shame that they wasted a fantastic product"
1099,Graham0509,"January 23, 2017",1,"Huge step backwards After years of loyalty, I'm dumping this now-worthless app after what can only be described as a quantum leap backwards for the Bloomberg app in its latest iteration. Unstable, counterintuitive (even for Bloomberg), and somehow even the content seems to have been substantially cut back. Advice from your above-average intelligence user base: try piloting your product for a few months before launch, instead of dropping this steaming pile of crap right in the laps of your millions of loyal customers."
1100,wrwing,"July 16, 2008",4,"I like it. I like it.  Really shows off the iPhone interface and capability.   Unlike others, I've had no trouble adding stocks to my list."
1101,GWB7,"July 16, 2008",5,"Excellent Application Bloomberg has done an excellent job bringing essential world market data, stock prices , and news in an easy to use form. They are also quick to fix any bugs or issues. Highly recommend."
1102,iPhone over BlackBerry...,"February 14, 2009",5,"Great app! I still give it 5 stars because it's mostly bug-free, has very good content, has a pretty good UI, and it's free. However, this update doesn't work and it renders the app useless - you have to delete and reinstall... I'm hopeful this will be fixed in short order..."
1103,JW223,"October 27, 2009",5,Need Email Within App I have been using the app for a while and the only addition I'd like to see is the ability to email news stories from within the app. It get annoying to have to go back and reopen the app.
1104,IowaPrairie,"October 24, 2012",4,Crashes on startup 2.11.7 on an iPhone 4s. Ran fine until today. Now startup is followed by a total crash. 
1105,Jkelly35,"December 20, 2016",1,"Horrible update The update ruined this app. I now have to keep the app open in order to listen to live radio. The new design is much more difficult to use. They took what was a great, easy to use app with terrific information and turned it into complete crap. They need to change back to the old version asap. Until a change is made, I will not be listening to the radio or using the app. Would give the new update no stars if possible."
1106,DKUS86,"January 24, 2017",1,Bye Bye Bloomberg Version 4.02:  Still a PoS.  Why do you insist on maintaining this disastrous layout when all of the reviews you have received for version 4 are negative? 
1107,Cfkwrh,"February 4, 2017",1,"Bloomberg is great, the last update destroyed it though I love Bloomberg, it's the only place to get objective market analysis these days, but this last update absolutely ruined the app. There used to be a menu where you could sort news by area, now it's just a single page with headlines you have to scroll down through. And the markets tab at the bottom is just the indexes, its none of the actual news. They ruined this app and I have no idea why."
1108,Donrichblahblah,"March 19, 2017",1,I console myself by reading an ever growing list of bad reviews I now read the daily compounding 1-star ratings reviews to console myself... It is utterly astonishing that Bloomberg would choose to simply ignore the scores of poor reviews. The hubris of ignoring the plight of so many calls for a roll-back to the previous version is what is annoying. The new version is simply put CRAP. No % gains over periods on graphs...tacky layouts... bad colour schemes. The latest version is undeniably way worse than the old version!
1109,Dreamzz of Failing,"June 5, 2017",5,Ground-Breaking App Ground Breaking App here . It's a very innovative and intuitive app just start using it and trust me you will fall in love. Also Bloomberg pushes out breaking news alert to your phone much faster than other news services. Very Impressive!!
1110,casualuser5,"June 9, 2014",5,"This is the Real Deal I worked for Bloomberg for almost 15 years, so I know first hand what an excellent company it is. The functionality of the app is really good, the quality of the data is outstanding and you can't beat the news."
1111,EL PPIG,"June 18, 2014",5,"Great app Great app, I'm a novice in this realm but have stock, I would like to see more definitions and novice oriented tutorials for understanding rise and fall of stocks and mutuals.  I would like to be able to put in purchase date and amount of stock and see the value of my investment growth in specific $amount."
1112,zome,"July 6, 2014",4,It's Back! This was one of my favorite Apps until someone decided to destroy it a couple of versions ago.

1114,plustickny,"September 7, 2014",5,Great for keeping up with financial news Wake up every morning to Bloomberg alerts on my iPhone-know what I need to explore before my coffee & paper-quick update for those with need to have breaking business news.
1115,just-a-nickname,"November 13, 2014",5,DON'T UPDATE!!! All they did is they just added tacky full-screen adds! I had two of them within just 5 seconds toggling between different tabs. This is simply ridiculous!! Really Bloomberg? Are you THAT desperate now??? 
1116,Whatswronghere,"January 14, 2015",5,"I don't understand bad reviews This app is beautifully made-- the notifications are faster than other news sources.  The data provided is difficult to find elsewhere on an app, in one place.  Thanks for doing a great job!"
1117,checkit345,"January 27, 2015",1,"Fail I just fail to grab why a company would decide to change a product people love. Ever see google redesign their interface in a big way? Well, these guys did. I loved the navigation and how I could reach thugs quick, then this update came in and I have to bend over just to get where I want."
1118,Tommy_is_awesome,"January 30, 2015",1,"Awful update !!! Please bring back the old version.  This new version is awful.  Really terrible.  I no longer can even use this app.   Feels like a 1st grader did the update.  News options are confusing and hard to navigate.  What happened to ""top stories"".  And there are no specific ""sub"" news categories to choose from.   And the navigation from news to market data is annoying.   Really embarrassing on bloombergs behalf."
1119,dutchfury,"December 18, 2016",5,Horrible update This went from a grown up app to a kids app overnight. All I want to do is scan the news efficiently. One line per headline is all you need. Now the whole app looks like the clickbait sponsored stories you see at the bottom of websites.
1120,Blaster SB,"July 10, 2008",5,Must Have for Any Financial Professional! What a great application which shows in real time all the carnage that is occuring daily in the equity and fixed income markets.
1121,Theshadow0710,"July 15, 2008",3,"A great first start but needs a lot of tweaking Luckily for me I never had  bloomberg crash when I added stocks but it consistently crashes when I exam the world markets....I really hope a new update for this app comes soon if you study finance or in finance this app is a must, but then again a good app is a stable app so even with all the bells and whistles this app needs a lot of of work =\."
1122,OakTree99,"July 29, 2008",4,"One frustrating limitation 1) Only 100 stocks can be followed now within My Stocks. Need to increase this number, and ideally allow to track more than one portfolio, i.e., create multiple My Stocks portfolios."
1123,Dxtra,"September 11, 2008",5,"No Ads please The last thing I want is my phone full of ads. I'll rather pay . Reconsider please. On another note some people don't apreciate anything, giving bad reviews for personal reason, keep in mine the develepor is doing us a favor. Great app works perfect for me"
1124,Cholulafire,"November 9, 2009",5,Stunning Graphics I'm a stock market junkie and this app has about everything I could ask for. Plus the graphics are superb and navigation is simple. 
1125,Shazzzam28,"October 2, 2010",2,"Ok for novice I've been day trading for over 10 years now and was so happy when the iPhone and iPad came out because I taught that I would really be able to analyze stocks charts. Developer!!! Please, please, please add technicals like being able to add support and resistance lines and trend lines!!! Please!!! This is like the most basic tool to have and to see that not even one app in the app store has this makes me laugh and cry at the same time. Please add it."
1126,tauarbor,"October 7, 2013",1,"Version 3.0 Unusable I no longer see key pieces of watchlist data on one screen at the same time, and all my different Vanguard fund names are nearly unreadable, so the watchlist is now useless to me."
1127,LeoSandLenny,"February 27, 2014",5,All your information in one place This App keeps me informed of all my financial information. The App is easy to use and is one of my favorite. I can't start or end my day without the information Bloomberg gives me throughout the day.
1128,Zootooz,"February 4, 2017",1,"Crap! This doesn't really work with iPad. Less than half the screen is used. It is really an iPhone only app. Negates the reason I use an IPad rather than an iPhone. Not well organized, and not nearly as useful as the previous version, which I really liked, and used every day. I deleted it almost immediately after checking it out. Both CNBC and Yahoo finance apps are MUCH better. Sad that Bloomberg is no longer a viable option in the finance app space."
1129,secondchair,"February 13, 2017",1,"Very disappointing The latest update is a significant step backwards. This is a site I used to use frequently, now less and less often. Previously designed to provide a significant amount of information in a succinct fashion, with some personal customization.  Now little better than other notification pages. Bloomberg also tinkers with its updates too often, without progress, and very clunky update process."
1130,ScottDS,"February 14, 2009",3,New update is awful Have been using this app since it was released to check the markets daily. Always had worked great. Especially liked the hidden clown face until they found out about it. Just updated to the 2.0 version and now it crashes every time I launch it. Yes - I even rebooted. No luck. 1 star until this is fixed.
1131,mdo609,"March 28, 2009",5,Great econs/finance app Bloomberg is a fantastic economic news source with good journalism; the app is very well-designed and stable.  Does a good job at keeping you up with current market news and stock prices.  A must-have if you're interested in the economy even for a slight bit.
1132,Just Trouble,"October 31, 2012",5,Ugh oh!! Probably the #1 finance app I use and have used ever since I got a iPhone! (iPhone 3) never have I had a problem until this morning and it looks like I'm not alone! CRASHIN!!! I wonder if it has anything to do with sandy? Please fix because this app is ESSENTIAL to my day. Thanks so much
1133,DanBerk,"October 16, 2013",5,"Does it's job well Get stock info easily and clean. I originally did not use the news features, then I started getting push news stories. They are fantastic, only important news, and you can stream like tv, like Obama speeches."
1134,ssclaw,"October 16, 2013",4,"more useful than ever like the new update with the ability to see both numerical and percentage change in markets, with time of last update by market.  News is cleaner too.  would like to be able to sort indices view.  maybe you can ; haven't tried."
1135,PABands,"March 9, 2014",5,"Excellent. Love the news & watch list aspects of this app. I find the articles to be well written & insightful. I am tired of people complaining about the political bias. Everyone & everything is biased, we are human, that's how humans operate. Hope they keep up the great work."
1136,JWT/Nac,"July 3, 2014",5,Jack Great source of information. Improved graphics and layout. Daily usage for financial info and updates. Easy to get around and see news across a wide spectrum. Use several times daily.
1137,DonCarluccio,"July 5, 2014",5,"Best news app available I have been using this app since the original iPhone came out. It's the only non-apple app to have made it, by my choice, onto EVERY other iOS device I have ever owned. Hands down the best news and finance app available."
1138,DamnielH,"December 18, 2016",1,Horrible rates zero stars Worst app update ever done.  Layout is horrible.  Was my first choice in news source and now my last if at all.  Why would an app developer decide to use only a narrow section of the iPad screen.  Doesn't work well on IPhone either.  Disaster.  Fire your team and start over or go back to the old app.
1139,sslack88,"January 3, 2017",1,"Useless, no background audio anymore This app used to be great because I could listen to the live TV and radio in the background while doing other tasks on my phone. Now as soon as you leave the app the audio stops.  Also, you used to be able to turn off the video and just listen to the audio saving reducing data consumption.  Now this app is no better than the CNBC app. Useless now! Roll back to the previous version please!"
1140,Europria,"July 13, 2008",2,"Entering own portfolio not usable. Good idea but portfolio tracker is not working well. I tried to add my own stocks, finding stocks is no where near to Apple's. After couple of attempts I gave up. It is nearly impossible to find GS or GE. You cannot enter the ticker, it makes you type the company name but so many irrelevant results come up, just gave up. I believe they will fix it later, but as it is now, it is complementary to Apple's stock, not replacement."
1141,"Just Some Guy, Y'know","July 27, 2008",5,"Fantastic!  Great access to news and quotes. This has become my go-to app when I'm stuck in a line, or otherwise have a few spare moments.  Love being able to browse the news so easily.  Sure, it's not BloomBerg Anywhere, but it's free.  Thanks BloomBerg!"
1142,Mmbaroque,"December 16, 2008",5,"Awesome! If you've ever had the chance to utilize an actual Bloomberg machine, you will recognize some of the features available. This is much better than the standard yahoo-based stocks app and for free, it's well worth the download. It is easy to use to boot!"

1147,Jes878,"December 13, 2016",2,"Used to be the best This was the best app for tracking stocks until they published a new version on December 13, 2016. Now it is difficult to use. With the new version it takes many clicks and several screens to review daily watch list results. Whereas in the previous version the information was consolidated on a single screen. I am now looking around for a better stock market app."
1148,Xzt1,"December 14, 2016",2,Disappointed I opened my app today to find that the Bloomberg page had been completely changed. It is definitely not as informative or as easy to read and use as was the previous version. I was especially disappointed withe the way that person investment accounts are now shown. Not really that helpful anymore. Is there anyway to go back? Please!
1149,alanmb,"January 23, 2017",1,The newly redesigned version is horrible! I used to use the Bloomberg app on my iPhone and iPad many times every day.  The recently redesigned app is HORRIBLE!
1150,Happysin,"February 15, 2009",3,"New version crashes to ""desktop"" I loved the old version of this app, so I'm not doing the ""1 Star"" thing for this review.  But the new version, even after rebooting my iPhone, crashes without even really launching.  So it is literally unusable to me on my 3G iPhone right now."
1151,Tom00119,"April 7, 2010",5,Great app Wonderful picks!  10 out of the 12 picks I have used made money and after trading costs/taxes I am up just over 1% per week in a flat market (up 15.8% this year).  I'll take a net 1% a week.... can't argue about being on track for better than 52% annual returns
1152,Happy1now,"December 24, 2013",5,Great App for Up to Date Market News Bloomberg has done an incredible job of placing a large amount of resources in the palm of your hand. My gripe if I have one is that the video seems to timeout at time. A quick relaunch of the app fixes the problem.
1153,todd7polaris,"June 6, 2014",5,Continuous Improvement with each release Surprisingly dynamic and relevant financial information that offers alerts.  Particularly impressive given the limited display size on a phone.

1155,Fobaten,"July 17, 2014",4,"Good App! I use this app several times a day. Although I really like it, I liked it better when I could just scroll down for all of the listings of the Commodities rather than having to change between the different categories. Anyway, thanks for a really good app!"
1156,Maximus 7008,"August 4, 2014",2,"Facts twisted into comedy I read this stuff to laugh. Bloomberg can twist any fact, percentage, or number horribly negative and make it positive. A total liberal agenda and trying to convince people with no jobs and money the world is good. They can buy a car, house and dog. Just can't buy gas or make car payment, pay the mortgage or feed the dog. Bloomberg can make this positive. I guess when your a billionaire you print this deceit with a smile."
1157,Bachewe,"August 6, 2014",5,"Handy, practical and easy to use I love the app. I have found it to be very useful for the segments of business I find important. I also find it easy to stay abreast with all that is happening around the globe. I sincerely recommend this app."
1158,AKABanker,"December 16, 2016",5,Awful Update! This is absolutely the worst update I have seen. I used the previous version multiple times daily and loved it. This version is not usable in my opinion. Complete garbage. I would rate it negative stars if I could.
1159,kirbdog261,"January 16, 2017",5,Flawed The new style and version is lacking the power Bloomberg is known for.  So limited and no longer my first site of the day.  Are the writers still employed because I am seeing only a quarter of the stories in this new version.
1160,iamanush,"July 16, 2008",5,"Awesome!!! This product is absolutely great. I was part of this company long ago... wow.. what a turnover for iPhone from Bloomberg. Must get for those who follow financial news. With the latest update, I think Bloomberg must have fixed the bugs and crashes.."
1161,Splatham,"July 18, 2008",5,Extremely useful and well thought out. This is a great tool on the go. Very interactive software and up to the minute articles makes this the best financial news app available. I highly recommend it!
1162,BurningNeuron,"July 23, 2008",3,"Missing one critical feature I really wish they would give you the ability to enter a ""price paid"" and quantity for the items in your portfolio.

1163,GeneonMAC,"August 8, 2008",5,"The best! This is the best news service I have come across, iPhone or otherwise.  While I subscribe to the WSJ on line, this is more precise, easy to read on the iPhone and offers about everything one could ask for.  Well done!"

1170,jeffreymack,"July 10, 2008",5,As a Wall St professional this might be my savior... I really like this effort.  It puts a lot of the important information I need when I'm away from my terminal.

1171,Predfan9899,"May 17, 2016",5,The go to app for market info Wonderful app. Good reporting and useful information. Everything I need. Just wish stock quotes were real time or streaming. Had to delete & then reinstall to fix the widget in the notification area.
1172,DonPlumba,"August 3, 2016",4,"Great For Watching Market On The Go This app his by far my favorite for following index and market rates.

1173,Faigyj,"December 15, 2016",5,Killed a great app I agree with all the other reviews! They ruined a great app!!! You can no longer stream tv or radio the lay out is weird and there are ads everywhere!! Please bring back the old app this is a disgrace! Don't update at all costs!
1174,Grinner6,"December 16, 2016",1,"Can you undo an upgrade? This latest ""upgrade"" is terrible. It turns a decent iPad style app into a 4th rate iPhone app. Information that used to be semi-readily available is either no longer there or difficult to find. It's gone from an app that plays well in landscape to one that give a portrait style presentation regardless of orientation."

They have now removed almost all the valuable information like the individual share profit/loss, total position etc. You are now also not able to add any additional shares to the watch list and prompts you to contact them to upgrade to some pro version of Bloomberg. The app has really gone backwards."
1176,Andy D Love,"January 24, 2017",1,"Nothing works anymore!! A short list of things completely broken. You cannot play Bloomberg radio unless you stay in app with the screen on. Chromecast? I watched bloom every cast from my phone constantly, now that's dead. I click an article and the adds don't play so I never get to the article. This was a must have app for me and now I'm just trying to figure out how to replace it. Just revert back to the old version it was immensely more useful."
1177,ScottieEllh,"January 30, 2017",1,"Bad Update Please restore the previous version of your app, it was fantastic. This new, improved version is the worst financial app I have ever seen or used. The previous version had everything, in a one stop kind of layout, and gave me all the information I could ever want. This new version has completely ruined the watch list functionality. I am going to delete the app from my devices and await the return of the earlier version."
1178,Bob McGarry,"February 6, 2017",4,"Mr If I could I would give this app no stars. Have used Bloomberg for years but this is worse than any app I have ever used. Cannot make changes in MarketWatch ( remove positions, change purchase prices, Change position sizes). Am willing to pay for previous version of this app."
1179,Fredfrdfred,"February 9, 2017",1,👎New version is poor (old version was super) The old version was full of important information and I used several times a day: from 4AM until the markets closed.
1180,Ponchu,"November 11, 2008",4,"Way better than native stock app Bloomberg goes above and beyond the pre-installed stock app for truly in-depth and intelligent management of portfolios. While it is packed with functionality, it gets only four stars because it's still a bit buggy and crashes every once in a while."
1181,SantafeNM,"February 15, 2009",5,Warning 2.0 doesn't work The latest version crashes and will have to be fixed. Don't update until it is fixed. Maximum stars when it is working again.
1182,drM3zzanin3,"June 19, 2009",5,"Great News App One of my first go-to apps when I wake in the morning. Only thing I wish it had was real-time stock updates, not delayed. Still give it 5 stars though. Slick interface and well designed throughout!"
1183,Chrysalister,"May 18, 2012",2,"Not too good Sends push notifications even after shutting off, and even when you click on the push notification and it takes you into the app it doesn't bring up the story you were concerned about and instead takes you to the list of articles most of which are 20+ hours old and are not ordered newest first."
1184,Sue Pellegrino,"January 2, 2014",5,Review My favorite app. 
1185,llexaara,"February 21, 2014",4,Excellent app although streaming could be proved with audio I enjoy and recommend this app. It is timely and intuitive. I would like to see an upgrade to the audio feed as the volume levels are frequently too low for my liking. Overall an excellent app.
1186,Half Dimes,"April 14, 2014",5,Outstanding Financial News App I would be lost without it.  
1187,Ammar Alhassan,"October 5, 2014",5,"Excellent business application The Bloomberg app is by far one of the best, it is an essential app on all my devices and a great source of news; business or otherwise. The interface is also logical. Can't think of anything critical to add."
1188,Thundering storm,"December 16, 2016",1,"Ruined the watchlist! I used to love Bloomberg's watchlist.  The last version completely ruined it. Now I cannot see my total gains per security, 52 week high and low prices. I can't even sort on anything any more. And to make it worse there's a big ad that shows up now on top of the watchlist. I was using this app everyday.  But now I might just need to find some other app and trash this one.  "
1189,PerryBorenstein,"July 2, 2017",5,"An essential app An important App that addresses business from every angle, the economy, markets, politics, sociology, the international, and the personal. It treats business properly, in my view, as a critical component of modern life. It is refreshingly free of the nonsense in Apps and website that fixate on market gambling sycophantic bobble-heads."
1190,Funkdan,"January 23, 2014",4,"Showing no data in this app! Is It just me or this app doesn't work if you are not in the unite states,cause it appears to me when I open this app no data is downloading , I can't see nothing , I was wondering its because I'm not in the states, does anyone else have this problem ?"
1191,Joash Eduarte,"January 28, 2014",5,"Best App to manage your stocks Its hard to find an app compatible with Philippine stocks exchange. Most apps out there only handles US, EU, and China while skipping some stock exchange in developing countries. This app is the only software that can handle my portfolio perfectly without all the confusion."
1192,Bwolf123,"May 20, 2014",4,Quality This app has a lot of in depth reportinge and stories which I really enjoy. One suggestion would be to cut down on the amount of push notifications because a lot of them are irrelevant and the amount is annoying (at least for me).
1193,mpd1,"August 6, 2014",5,"Great way to check the markets quickly! I really enjoy using the Bloomberg app. I like checking the markets first thing in the morning, especially the futures. It's an easy way to get the information quickly and efficiently."
1194,sliceofzeus_zeus,"September 24, 2014",5,Amazing I love this app. I used to read the New York Times through my news stand app on my iPhone and I didn't like the subscription base.
1195,Buffalo Supernova,"October 23, 2014",2,"Sending me alerts to watch Bloomberg TV shows a big turnoff I sure want an alert on big news. However, suddenly last week I started getting daily alerts to watch some Bloomberg TV show every night . I tried to change settings to not include and it doesn't let me. I'm ready to delete the app if this continues even though I otherwise like the app. Fix it!!!!"
1196,R. Walker,"January 28, 2015",1,"Over engineered What happened? Someone get bored? The last two versions released have changed the original look and feel of this Bloomberg app. I used to use it all the time as my main source of information. It was well set out and had many subsections that were helpful. Why was the Regions section removed? Industries, sectors sections too! If I could access the previous version I would. For now I will use Reuters and CNBC. What a shame."
1197,Paul Riedi,"January 29, 2015",5,C'Mon Man! Why the upgrade? I don't understand the recent upgrade. Why make I harder to get to the data you want. The graph overlays which was the primary reason I use Bloomberg are no longer working. Please test your releases next time.
1198,Young kana,"January 31, 2015",1,"They made it worse Bloomberg recently changed their app to a new looking version with different formats. I used to use Bloomberg all the time for news and updates, especially on Real Estate, but now they don't even have a tab for Real Estate and it's hard to look for articles on it. I don't understand why they changed it. It went from being the best news app to being so poor I am planning on deleting this app."
1199,DukeNukem4Ever,"December 27, 2015",1,will change back to 5 stars if... Just stop redirecting to advertisements webpages non stop!
1200,nycnerd,"July 27, 2008",5,Best application so far Nice implementation and worth the price (free). There are so many free applications but they are not really worth it.
1201,Roscollin,"September 25, 2008",4,"Update: BEWARE, advertising I am super keen on this app."
1202,balijude,"February 3, 2009",4,"Pretty useful & well done market app... Love how you can track your portfolio for the day and get the main overview info you need on your stocks, etc.  Having a quick rundown of the market news is nice & helpful to have too.  Overall, this stands out as one of the best & most useful iPhone apps."
1203,dil71,"October 6, 2013",5,Excellent Provides all important market data and news in an easy to use and beautiful interface. I also love how I get push notifications for news that I find relevant right as it breaks.
1204,Muellerd,"October 18, 2013",4,"The best stock tracking app I have used. Only one misstep It is highly flexible and gives immediate access to the current value, daily gain/ loss , total gain/loss. The only glitch is it can no track trousers pharmaceutical (TRSX). I have no other problems. It also gives charts and daily financial news."
1205,ecnyc7,"January 2, 2014",4,"Bof Not nearly as good as previous version in my view. Just a disorderly magma of too many different screens, with a look & feel that I find most user-unfriendly."
1206,Daveydav,"December 14, 2016",1,"What were you thinking? Too bad there is not a way to roll back to the old app. This thing looks hideous, and is a mess. Hard to navigate, if you click on a story that was three quarters of the way down when you click back it takes you to the top of the list again. I used to really enjoy reading stories on this app I guess I'm going to have to find another place to get my information."
1207,Sandyny5,"December 19, 2016",5,"What a shame, will delete it. Please bring back the old one. This is now an advertising site where you don't find what you need. Really horrible. Audio turns off if screen goes to sleep"
1208,Gatmobile,"December 22, 2016",4,"An actual esthetically pleasing, informative app Contrary to what these other financial professionals are saying, I actually like this new update. The watchlist is quite literally a thumb click away and so is the market data snapshot. Did I mention you can also watch Bloomberg Live on this too??!"
1209,Aquadawg1,"February 4, 2017",1,Absolutely pitiful This latest update has pretty much made this app worthless to me. The last update was really bad but this one is far far worse.  Bloomberg has issues... they can't leave something that's not broken alone. Granted sometimes you have to update for functionality but to go and change almost everything is stupid. It was maybe a 1 1/2 before but now I would give it a 0 if I could.
1210,Cptn. Fuzzy Pants,"September 12, 2009",4,Could be better. Nice but an option to import all the stocks I've already entered in to the default stock app would be great. I have a lot of stocks and really don't feel like entering them all over again for just a few little changes that this app provides.
1211,林德,"March 23, 2012",3,"New version fails to load iPhone 4, up to date. Gets to asking to use location, but nothing more. Tried to turn off load news via settings - same problem. Looks like it maybe getting killed for taking too long to start. Removal from background doesn't help. Great app before this!"
1212,HAOZHI WEI,"September 22, 2012",4,"One more functions to perfect Great app. The reason I take down one star is that it can't play the video in the background. Every time I switch off the screen or switch to other app while AirPlaying the contents to my Apple TV, it automatically shutdown and reconnect means another ad. Hate it."
1213,Bobolopi,"February 23, 2014",4,Good but confusing headlines The app is pretty good and news and videos are worthy. But they try to get too clever with the headlines and it's often enough hard to figure out what the stories are about until reading them. That's annoying. Keep it simple.
1214,fsdomingues,"March 4, 2014",4,"The best app in the category It's a great tool for checking your investments related news on the go! Actually, as reported by some reviewers, you must have some criticism about the eventual bias on the news! Definitely it could be improved! On the other hand, it is a must have app!"
1215,SPX666,"August 19, 2014",5,"Best Finance App Futures, bonds and forex info is all better than CNBC. Stock quotes are all about the same. Live a TV is a major plus, and news is much higher quality. CNBC will break stories faster, but Bloomberg will have higher quality articles."
1216,Tomsf8,"September 22, 2014",5,"It's turning into my only news app Great app. I started using it for just financial news, but now find myself going to it for other parameters. I wish I could pay and remove the ads, but it's still great."
1217,Agshin76,"January 23, 2015",3,The latest version has several inconvenient features. The update has a very irritating feature. The ad keeps popping up and does not respond well when trying to close it. Also it looks like the application restarts ( takes up to 3 seconds) every time you open it.
1218,Nik776,"January 28, 2015",1,"Terrible update (again) Please Bloomberg app designers just admit you made a mistake with the ""navigation improvements"" and revert them. "
1219,Homerbuyer,"January 31, 2015",1,Getting worse and worse They've removed the most useful news topic groups and the ability to choose the groups you want. Now they've just left you with an overview topic so that they can spoon feed you crap you aren't interested in. Presumably so that only people paying $12k a month for a terminal can read the interesting stuff. Fine if that's what they want but don't waste our time even bothering to publish an app.
1220,Cecret,"July 11, 2008",5,"Great Application: Everything Stocks was missing! All the relevant market and security information at your fingertips.  Great news reader, no more loading web pages, just the text you want.  "
1221,eurotraveler,"August 2, 2008",5,"This is a fabulous app I entered all my stocks into this, and since then haven't used the Apple stock app at all.  This is one excellent app.  My wife also uses it now on her iPhone.  This is a must for anyone that wants financial info or to follow the markets throughout the day."
1222,Weathead,"September 12, 2008",4,"Doesn't the world have enough advertisements? Good thing I read the update notes.  I like the app, but really have enough ads in my face, so no thanks.  I'd gladly pay for the app if you feel you need to recoup development expense.  I'm watching my iPod, see? When a man comes on to tell me... How white my shirts can be..."
1223,akp221,"September 19, 2008",5,"Almost perfect This is fantastic, it just seems to take longer to download now that they've updated it--maybe because of the ads?  I would pay for a faster ad-free version."
1224,nick daniel,"October 21, 2008",4,Two problems I really love this app but two things need to be fixed. There needs to be a total of gains/losses for the day in your portfolio and stocks also need to show the yield. If these two things were put out in an update I would easily pay $10 for the app.
1225,chkdg8,"February 16, 2009",1,"What the hell is going on? I, like everyone else on here, use this app all day long to check my finances and now after the update it doesn't even load?  This is no good.  I thought that the update would keep on improving with additional language support but this needs to be addressed very soon.  I tried the recommended hard reset but that didn't work.  Hold off on this latest update until further notice from the developer."
1226,Jenkinsons,"November 30, 2014",1,"Awful now Terrible. In a word, that's what this app is. Bloomberg has clearly given up and don't care. The ads now block the entire page. You can't read anything before an ad comes to block you. For many sections, they've stopped updating stories.  No one at Bloomberg seems to care. I've always come to Bloomberg for news and information. If you can't be bothered to update the news on this app, stop the pretense, just dump it."
1227,Afarzad,"December 14, 2016",2,"Such a disappointment, bring back the old version I am so disappointed with this current update. It is beyond me on who came up with this new interface. It is just crap!!!"
1228,Lettore storico,"January 12, 2017",1,"What a lost opportunity.... This use to be the best app to track financial portfolios and it is now virtually useless with so many critical functions taken out. I as many others I'm sure, would have paid some subscription to keep using the app (maybe with some upgrade) where as I will certainly not jump from 0 cost to the USD 20k for the full subscription. May be I'm missing something but it looks a very stupid move from Bloomberg."
1229,Campcory,"February 4, 2017",1,"Ruined a great app. What were they thinking?  It's as if we were back to working with limited screen size and low bandwidth.  I can now only follow three currencies. For no reason, other than that they shrank the width of the box, as if I were viewing this on a 4"" iPhone screen, rather than an iPad. News stories are stuck in a narrow width window, not optimized for the iPad. Have they not heard of Dynamic Rendering???  Why were we forced to downgrade to this terrible app?"
1230,aeronut7424,"October 4, 2013",2,"Previous version better! Thanks for the efforts on this new version. However, much, much prefer the previous version. Too much information displayed on the iPhone version causing it to be too small to use. The region layout was much better on the previous version. Color coding was easier to read and view. This is a eye strain on the newer version."
1231,Brock4,"February 14, 2014",5,"Awesome stock app This app has all the details you need to track your portfolio.  However it does lack the ability to add or track more than one portfolio.  Other than that, I use this map every day."
1232,JasonLinnnn,"February 19, 2014",4,"Great changes Some of the upgrades are making it so much better than the old version, I really like the push notifications it sends to me whenever a major news comes out and I don't have much time to do the detailed readings."
1233,Husky0103,"April 23, 2014",5,"Great paper alternative. It's handy to have this app to read these articles without having to carry the print edition around. As for criticisms, it's better than most and offers insightful reports that offset technical matters."
1234,Cthruandthru,"June 25, 2014",5,Excellent app Very nice layout. Quick access to markets and tracking important holdings in my portfolio. Good links to news about markets and stocks. I have tried several financial apps and this is by far my favorite. Recommended!
1235,Bob403,"July 29, 2014",4,"My Go-To Financial Site Whenever I want an update on the total financial situation for my stocks or for the world, I depend on Bloomberg. The app has everything organized in a user-friendly way. I sometimes check it several times per day. This is actually true!"
1236,Hammerschell,"August 12, 2014",5,Big Fan The app works great and I am a huge fan of the content.  Great coverage of world news and events with a financial angle.  Easy to customize app and simple to use.  I would recommend to anyone looking for world financial news.
1237,Maxinvestor,"August 17, 2014",5,Excellent view of the market and easiest access to futures Bloomberg provides an excellent view of the market and it is one of the few sources that provides easy access to review futures prior to market open
1238,Thedotca63,"August 20, 2014",4,"Best market app, needs some improvement After a recent update, the search icon for quotes has been minimized and replaced by a button for Bloomberg radio. Consistently I hit the button accidentally and am  directed to the App Store. Some of the swiping can be improved."
1239,Trapper1959,"September 25, 2014",1,Mixed feelings This app supplies more info than any of the other ones I have. The only problem is the speed of updating. Most of the quotes are 20-30 minutes old and the Dow only updates every 15 minutes or so. I also noticed one of my stocks latest news article was from 2011. Other apps have daily news. Just fix the speed and I would be happy. But right now I still jump from app to app to get updated.
1240,ben.tang,"July 27, 2008",5,"absolutely phenomenal app BEST news reader out there so far, BAR NONE. quick to load (a HUGE consideration when creating apps for mobile devices) and enough meat in an article to get both the news and views. great job!!!!"
1241,GrahamBuffet Follower,"August 6, 2008",5,Would like to be able to track options. Other than that this app is amazing and better than other market data I have tried.
1242,Canoapple,"December 5, 2008",5,Best iphone app todate Gives iphone a whole new level of meaning. Best app ever. I really would like to thank Bloomberg for this. I would be happy to pay for this app. I am looking forward to future updates and even to paid ones.
1243,StockJunkie,"February 17, 2009",5,Easy fix People just delete the app and redownload. It takes less than a minute using Wifi. You'll lose your saved info but you'll have your Bloomberg back.
1244,DufferJ,"July 4, 2009",4,"Wish they added video As a banking professional, love the reading part but wish they added regularly news feed via video. So you can listen in the car etc... Would give this 5 stars as being 100% complete. C'mon Bloomberg, throw your TV/Video portion in this too!"
1245,Bloomberg reader,"July 3, 2016",5,"Still worse then prior versions and no way to filter on financial news Where is the ""financial"" news section. Bloomberg is used by those looking to see this"
1246,Marketnewsreader,"December 23, 2016",1,"Bllomber's latest app Just upgraded to the latest Bloomberg app - disaster! Dumbed down is the only way to describe it: just a few superficial rubrics that I have never read. Cannot get to the latest news, which was the main reason for using this app to begin with. Unclear how to navigate the market data section- I need to know a lot more than the three main stock indices. Please make the previous version available!  Thanks."
1247,Tyehjeb333,"January 3, 2017",5,"New App is TERRIBLE! The old one was my favorite app for the markets; however the new one is terrible. One star is generous. I'm going to delete it.  Big mistake to replace the old one with this one. Not sure who made that decision, but it was a really poor one."
1248,DannyK1968,"January 3, 2017",5,Wish I Read Reviews Before Deleting Old Version... I am so disappointed that an app touted as being written for iPad is really written for the iPhone. And I just deleted my old version! I hope I can get that back!!

1250,Traveling Yogi,"February 15, 2009",5,"Excellent Application I use this application daily!  I have only had a few update issues and i get ""Unknown Error"", but this was related to ""edge"" vs ""3G"".  Overall, a must have for anyone that tracks stocks, the markets, and World Business News!!!!"
1251,RTTrans888,"February 18, 2009",3,"Crashes every time I try to put in my own stocks This application looks very nice, but it takes me right back to the main menu every time I try to add stocks.  perhaps the people at Bloomberg could have another look and provide an update to fix this problem that others seem to be having."
1252,nickr00,"April 22, 2009",3,"Nice, but slow to load indexes Love the layout of this app, but it takes 30 seconds to update the market indexes when you first open the app, even on wifi.

1253,maxfink,"February 22, 2014",5,"Pretty good Use it all the time for news and quick portfolio view, pretty good app.  Earlier versions took up all the memory in my phone but i'm not sure if this one has that same problem."
1254,Kevyep,"March 30, 2014",5,Excellent This is the best news source by far. It is relatively easy to pour over the headlines and opening statements to see if the article is worth reading. Bloomberg makes me a very well rounded well read business person.
1255,Tom2491,"May 1, 2014",5,Don't be fooled by other reviews This app is great and updates you on news faster then any of my other news apps. I have had no problems with the new update so don't be discouraged to download.

1257,Tx5!ttgln143%d,"December 29, 2014",5,"Latest version very buggy. Normally I'm happy with this app, but this version seems to freeze iOS and also won't accept a decimal when editing the watch list."
1258,Scott1006,"January 7, 2015",1,"This version is awful! Bloomberg had been a main markets and news source for me first thing in the morning. But this latest update is awful for my new iPhone 6. News stories only fill 1/3 the screen, no pre-market stock quotes, news stories go beyond the right-hand margin, you get stuck in some places with no visible navigation buttons, navigation among menu options tedious. What the heck happened, Bloomberg?"
1259,bobsilver1,"February 10, 2015",3,Improved what they broke. Still needs improvement though. Ok Bloomberg reads reviews. After the last upgrade they broke navigation. I wrote my review comparing about that. This update rectified that. Now the news summary is just to limited. Expand it. I like to look at one area and see top stories. Not 1 per category.
1260,ianfloresta,"October 8, 2008",4,"Very nice This app has to be one of my favorites. It gives you some information of indicies, stocks, etc."
1261,Zorgatronn,"November 17, 2008",4,"A bit crashy but an excellent app to watch the markets It does tend to crash somewhat regularly, but it is not enough to annoy me.

1262,jimbo78,"December 7, 2008",4,"Best stock watching app out there! This is great if you need stock info quickly to make a trade. The Stocks app included in the iPhone was great but very limited.

1263,Bro soccer bro,"April 20, 2014",5,"Perfect I fell like a god-esque when I have this much information at the palm of my hand. Everything is quick and simple. Download this app and I'll send you a nude. If not, well then I hope your children have disabilities."

1266,Mikeroam1,"April 23, 2015",5,All the News I Need This app gets me all the National and International news and information I am looking for. I don't track individual stocks so the concern of others about their watch lists is not an issue for me.

The new app's watchlist no longer allows us to see to-date profit and loss (only 1 day is available), average purchase price across all lots, and the horizontal bar depicting 52-week price range. These features were in the old app and still available in the Bloomberg website. Please bring back the old app, especially these watchlist features"

1272,Fred_Diaz,"February 17, 2009",5,My most used app This is the best iPhone app I've seen. You get up to date market news. Follow worldwide indicies. Stocks have individual summary pages as well as links to related company news stories.  Basically Apple's stock app on steroids.

Tried it out several times and the same thing happened.  Hopefully this gets fixed soon.  Any chance the Bloomberg chat will be added to this app in the future?
1274,iApp4,"March 1, 2011",5,Effectively Communicates News This app provides a high level of quality content.  The app's content will keep you coming back.
1275,Saied S,"October 21, 2013",5,Nice Improvements I actually like the new experience.  I have been using the app for a few years and I am finding that it is easier to get around this new one and find what I am looking for.
1276,JLohavichan,"November 18, 2013",5,"Indespensibe The only finance app I use everyday to get a quick snapshot on my investment ideas. Greatly improved their watchlist capabilities in this version. Now if the had a market movers section I wouldn't need CNBC.  Oh well, definitely worth it."

Easy to use and understand with very little financial background knowledge required. For all ages and financial iq's out there.
1282,ElsieRM3,"August 10, 2014",4,Informative I depend on Bloomberg for information more than CNBC. Just wish there were fewer videos or ability to read content of videos. I don't always want others to hear what I am viewing. Ads drive me up a wall but understand necessity.
1283,garnetii,"August 20, 2014",3,"Slow but Sure Excellent total news and info content, but sad lack of real time info leads to having to use other apps, e.g, CNBC, whose news content is worthless.

1287,Justtounlockanapp,"January 29, 2017",1,From best market app to worst w/update How about fixing this Bloomberg? Totally worthless app now after this update. Color scheme is awful. Market pricing is difficult to find and read once opened. And what in the world happened to the pricing charts to follow trends for pricing (indexes & commodities) Seriously?!? An update that has LESS information available & WORSE flow & harder to read?!? What in the world was the thought with this design? Completely awful!
1288,CaptNic,"January 31, 2017",1,Good For Nothing The iPhone implementation after the most recent update is as buggy as the iPad. Watchlist functionality was removed. The iPad version is so buggy I use my phone exclusively and will not update that app. If you set up a watchlist the data displays overwritten text and values. Makes it useless. I just downloaded the latest update (Jan 25 and Jan 31) and nothing changed. At least it got me to look at other functional apps.
1289,JuanZinhoo,"February 1, 2017",1,"Design advice Im all for the cleaner look. But the user experience just went from 100 to 0 real quick. Miss the old layout and the user experience the last version had. I would suggest going back to that but keeping the white theme if you are married to it.

1291,candymanjl,"September 30, 2009",5,Best news related app I've tried so far This program works great and is supported well!  The content is updated often and so is the app itself.  The landscape view support when looking at a stock quote is cool too.
1292,lost canuck01,"January 3, 2010",5,"excellent for business It has to be one of the best financial application iphone has. Even though other applications, I rated one star, this one is the best.

1293,Ammre barakat,"November 30, 2012",3,Good but needs some more work to make it a fully functional app Works well accept for the live tv stream needs to support video out only allows sound to come thru on my tv and as you guess try looking at the stock ticker on your iPhone or any mobile device if that was corrected app would be rated 5 stars

1297,Thunayan Alghanim,"October 29, 2013",4,Great App The bloomberg app is great its a user friendly app easy to move around. The only problem I'm getting is a glich on the stock watchlist whenever I want to edit the watchlist or add a ticker the app shuts down. I hope that the developer could see through it and fix it.
1298,Gtbcpa,"March 3, 2014",5,Great app! I have used this app now for several years and really like it. It consistently provides great information and allows me to track my stocks with up to date and precise info. I recommend it.

1303,Asher.SB,"June 16, 2015",4,"Great app, to many ads The app works well and is pretty fast, that said there are to many ads in all the wrong places. I think the app could also use an interface that matches the new Bloomberg business website."
1304,Kevin Philips-Bong,"May 22, 2016",1,"Very slow to load, with significant lag The new update has made this app a pain to start up — it takes 5-10 seconds for the app to show anything, and it will somehow 'open' multiple versions of the same article when loading. Also, the radio now automatically starts playing when the app starts and there doesn't appear to be a way to turn it off. Please fix!"

1306,Macallan_25,"December 15, 2016",1,What a TERRIBLE update! I've been using the previous app for years.  It provided virtually all the information you would want at a glance.  This upgrade renders it barely one step removed from worthless.

This should NOT be the case where the most information is vital to critical decisions. I can no longer see purchase pricing, lots, purchase dates of lots, growth from inception.

1308,fun33,"March 23, 2017",1,Total Garbage First Bloomberg ruined one of the best apps available with this pathetic update. Fortunally I was able to reinstall the old app and use it for the past month. Now these morons at Bloomberg have made the previous version inoperative and are forcing the use of this new garbage update. NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!!!!!!!!  One think Michael Bloomberg's 3 year old great grandson wrote this update but that would be a slander on the intelligence of all 3 year olds. THANKS FOR NOTHING BLOOMBERG - this is total junk.
1309,Renee Sil,"June 26, 2017",2,"Terrible update Most of my watch list suddenly disappeared with the latest update. No more easy access to my holdings without having to go to my brokerage accounts. While I still like the latest financial news available on the app, there seems to be no logical reason for cutting back on this popular feature."
1310,kyotendochi,"December 10, 2013",4,does what you want in a tight package I like new version. it's efficient with data & space. links & videos play in app. as always.
1311,JSW--SF,"December 23, 2013",5,A must have business app News updates I didn't even know I needed at my fingertips. Plus a great portfolio tracking tool without the logging in required from my broker (for obvious reasons).

It would be nice to be able to do a costom sort or maybe be able to group stocks based on specified criteria!!!
1327,Tiiiight,"October 7, 2013",5,Best stock app out there For a quick simple look at how the stocks I own / are watching this is the best app out there.  Easy to use and simple to read while on the go.   Wouldn't wish for anything else
1328,Wanchese,"October 8, 2013",5,World in a Glance Bloomberg provides the best international financial coverage. The single page view of world equity indices is the first thing I look at after the alarm clock. No better way to surmise overnight events than a full page of green....or red.
1329,Scotthouston715,"November 9, 2013",5,Great app Very simple after u use it and just understand it. Never glitches or fails me. Data right were I want it and it's no fuss with adds or game invites. Support team is great answered my question in email quickly.

You could swipe over for more data columns. This has been replaced by large in-line ads breaking up the lists every half screen, fewer data columns, no swipe over for more data, and summary data on a separate screen. Nearly unusable. Fail!"
1334,Klaus Vaillant,"January 2, 2017",1,"👎Horrible, December update is unusable I agree with ALL the other many 1⭐️ feedbacks. The update is so bad it does not even need an explanation. Do not upgrade, keep your pre-December version. I feel so sorry for the app product management to have to destroy a good product so some managers can proof they can make it profitable or squeeze out even more money. The tremendous lack of usability in this version will backfire on the management approach by loosing all the users."
1335,jcamilleri,"January 3, 2017",1,Terrible - still can't believe it Bloomberg have literally destroyed the Bloomberg App with this version. What on earth are they thinking. No longer able to watch or even listen to Bloomberg media and read or surf articles. Simply can't believe this was not a victim of a cyber  attack releasing a retrograde version of the app. Don't update if you have the old app and hopefully Bloomberg with revert to the previous version prior to this disaster. 
1336,Ppeddi,"January 24, 2017",1,"Perfect example how screw things up When everything was working properly, here comes a UI/UX designer who re-designed this app and completely messed it up. Unfortunately apple doesn't even allow you to rollback old versions and users are left with crappy app now. I would first fire UI designer then bring back old version. They don't even have a common sense of not removing feature when redesigning the UI."

1338,BobATL,"March 7, 2017",2,HORRIBLE REPEAT HORRIBLE I didn't get a chance to refuse an update this poor excuse for software just showed up. Shame on you Bloomberg to ruin a great thing. You didn't even give us a chance for a paid ad free version. In addition when deleting a stock from watchlist the program will not let you save the deletion (save button greyed out)therefore limited to no edit capability.
1339,Paden Woods,"May 17, 2017",3,"App works fine for me, however..... The app works fine and I was confused why there were negative reviews. My only complaint is that in the markets and politics section, some stories don't pop up on the mobile app that would pop up on the website on a computer"

1373,Gonzo_77,"October 8, 2013",4,Good solid app This has the best video streaming of any app I have used so far. Other apps often freeze up when I try to view their video content. Over all it us a good solid app that I use everyday to keep me up to date on financial news.
1374,r.belozi,"October 10, 2013",5,"Awesome app You can watch Bloomberg live and you get push notifications on business news!!! This is a must have app for investors, business people, and business students."
1375,Jack in Kona,"October 24, 2013",5,Watch list great - stop the videos New expanded stock list is an improvement   
1376,slsullivan77,"December 21, 2013",5,Back to best in class This latest update is a big improvement in readability and ease of use. My only ask would be to reenable Watchlist graphing functionality as in prior versions.
1377,ContractsMan,"December 27, 2013",5,Bloomberg This revised app improves over the previous version.  It is a little faster to download the news and fixes some bugs.  It gives me my daily finance news fix.
1378,Jahyuns,"March 10, 2014",5,"Easy and fast to use to obtain current financial news As a business student, I have used this app extensively to keep in touch with the financial industry and gather info for interviews. Highly recommend it."
1379,Finearf,"April 26, 2014",5,"Great source for in depth reporting I use Bloomberg constantly not just to check stock but for the excellent news gathering and in depth reporting. If you take what you read and think, there are stock plays to be had"
1380,Ollie Strickland,"July 13, 2008",4,Solution to crashing bug... never remove all stocks I was able to avoid the crashing by adding my stocks BEFORE removing the default Apple stock that comes with the application.  Bug occurs when adding a stock when number of current stocks == 0.
1381,Eggie-bomb,"July 13, 2008",4,"Great App Overall, this seems like a great App...all the stock data is great.  Would like to see more customization features in the news section.  Such as the ability to get news for select industry's and select companies."
1382,ryanmfrancis,"July 15, 2008",5,Awesome I have not experienced the crash problems others have. I like it a lot. Wish I could delete the stocks app that comes with the iPhone because bloomberg completely replaces it.
1383,mr.dreams,"October 11, 2008",3,"Agree with boardhead The latest update has slowed this app down considerably.  Before I could look up news, my stocks and other information quickly(even on edge).  Now even on a wifi connection it's still sluggish.  I kno it's free but it was functioning much better b4 the latest update.  Please fix."
1384,Darkknights9,"December 6, 2008",3,Ok but flawed Well it worked fine while it worked. Lots of useful and well organized infomation but one day it just stopped opening oh well. BTW the guy complaining about the delayed quoted obviously doesn't trade and is dumb seeing as NO newspapers or other sources are allowed to give live quote info to the public before verification.
1385,lynchseattle,"February 18, 2009",4,"Excellent!  Better than the iPhone Stock App Fantastic app to get a quick rundown on where things are in the market.  I'd been using the one that ships with the iPhone for a while, but that one just doesn't give you any details beyond the basics.  The drilldowns on this are great!"
1386,Redlaser rufugee,"January 1, 2010",4,"Great app check it daily Awesome news feed. Bloomberg blows away the competition. Would be five star if you could read news stories in side view, dividend yield was included in stock summary, and it would allow news que to be longer."
1387,Megalodonx2,"July 4, 2010",4,"Full-featured app The best financial app I've used. There are only two drawbacks for me; the lack of real-time quotes and an issue downloading audio from the app. It seems to play only a fraction of the supposed length.  It's top-notch overall though, a must-have for market info."
1388,Ggrggrgg,"December 28, 2016",1,"Bring back the old versions PLEASE! Please be humble and admit that you totally messed up. You just don't know what your customers like about your apps. It's like The Economist magazine rebranding itself as a tabloid, or Charlie Rose joining the Kardashians. It's just beyond comprehension"
1389,Jo3X,"February 27, 2017",1,Very Disappointed with this version! I've been using this magnificent app for a long time but this version with all the respect is very uncomfortable to use. 
1390,Jpanarama,"February 11, 2014",5,Favorite App Hands down my favorite app. Great way to stay abreast with the markets/current news while I'm away from the office. The new layout is also much better than previously. Nice work!
1391,Scott Jeffries,"February 17, 2014",5,Must read news! Bloomberg And the mobile news so are must have for business. I look at it several times a day. Indispensable to business.
1392,Joe Ryder,"March 2, 2014",5,"First app I open every time I unlock my phone. I use this app when I wake up, at lunch, and after work to check my stocks and read the news on my holdings. Not perfect but I am very satisfied."
1393,Travel & Finance,"March 2, 2014",4,"Sr. Director While always good this product has seen significant improvements in its usability. It's strengths include less talking heads, more facts and numbers then other comparable products. In addition it contains significantly more news worthily articles. In terms of political bias, net net: more PBS then Fox (another plus - sick of political linkage)"
1394,Sportsdart,"August 18, 2014",4,Very informative App Only reason why it is not 5 stars is because there is so much data within the user interface that the processing speed for an iPhone 4 can be really slow and cumbersome at times.
1395,66049 student,"September 23, 2014",5,"Incredible user interface Financial information gets pretty dense, but Bloomberg always keeps the info timely and practices solid writing. The app is easy to use and quick."
1396,Venkatvinoth,"September 26, 2014",4,Great app for stock watch list and portfolio management Have never come across any app that provides such detailed info about each stocks and managing them with great ease
1397,Charlie - Baltimore,"February 28, 2015",1,Navigation improvements are bad Bloomberg does not appear to read and respond to reviews. Like a turtle it has retreated to a shell as protection from the reality that the last update has significantly degraded user experience. I'm willing to watch the ads just improve the functionality of the app to that which existed prior to when you ruined it (see 4 versions ago when the app was orange and internal navigation was simple)
1398,Jbellu,"November 4, 2015",2,"Not impressed with update I have used app as primary source of business news for years. I loved the simplicity and ease of navigation of the old version. The new version is cumbersome and difficult to navigate quickly. If next update isn't better, I will be looking for another source of world news and finance data."
1399,Roberto.baggio,"March 2, 2016",5,Update Issue Recently updated the app and it wouldn't open at first. I turned my phone off and turned it back on and it started working.
1400,T-DAWG!,"July 14, 2008",5,"Excellent Everyone above has stated how I feel... however if you turn the phone into landscape mode you get the format in the screenshot, It doesn't take a genius to figure that out."
1401,mbender71,"July 17, 2008",5,"All other iPhone apps should aspire to this one! This is by far the best looking application I've downloaded. The interface is polished and beautiful, not to mention top notch financial information at your finger tips!"
1402,tedolson,"July 22, 2008",5,WOW - This is the best app that the Iphone has to offer!!! I will never use the iPhone stocks application again.  Bloomberg is 1000% better.  Very impressive.  What a great tool.  It is by far the best app that I have seen for the iPhone.  It is a must have.
1403,Bruno Milanello,"September 14, 2008",5,"Very complete If you are looking for a different stock app, that is the one you should get it. My only concern is about the downloading time, it's higher than the standard stock app that we have."
1404,aapl_fan,"August 14, 2009",4,"Will not load after latest update Unfortunately, the app no longer loads after the latest update. I've tried rebooting the phone but no luck. I'm on 2g iPhone with 2.2.1 sw. "
1405,cyin,"September 28, 2010",5,Best brief up-to-date summary on business breaking news I read a lot of financial news.  Bloomberg is by far the best in keeping up-to-date on important business news.
1406,MeScorpio,"June 20, 2013",5,Top 10 Top 10 before market opening have been missing for the last 2 days. When do we see them again?
1407,Detox897,"October 5, 2013",3,Excellent new layout but lots of annoyances The new layout shows you a nice breakdown of each individual stock but the ads everywhere are annoying. And there is too much fine print at the bottom of the watch list instead of just displaying stocks only.
1408,Majeds1223,"December 21, 2016",5,Watch list is destroyed!! BBG took an amazing warchlist that was my favorite and turned it into a completely useless watch list that is barely even worth look looking at. Please fix!!!
1409,Walther von Stolzing III,"December 22, 2016",1,"Worst update ever! Truly awful! Fire the designer now. This version of the Bloomberg app is horrible compared to prior versions.  This used to be a well designed and useful product but the new layout with the giant ads which you are forced to scroll through make it nearly worthless.  I never imagined I would write this, but the latest Yahoo Finance app is now much better than this  Bloomberg ""update."""
1410,chandler.si,"April 13, 2014",5,"Fast and customizable Best financial news app I've ever used. I can customize the look of the feeds. As a logged-in user, the Watch List feature nicely bridges Bloomberg mobile/desktop."
1411,Vancejeremiah,"May 4, 2014",5,"Great financial news source and App! I liked the old app, not sure the new app is that much better, but still love getting my Bloomberg news. It is the app I use most on my iPhone despite the liberal bias."
1412,grrvel,"July 18, 2014",4,"Useful Every Day I use this app every work day for a quick look at the markets, a sample of the news and a rough idea of how my individual stocks are doing. I start most mornings with a few minutes on this app and it is fine for that."
1413,Eagle0504,"July 28, 2014",5,Review for Bloomberg App Very good use! Notifications easy to understand and in time. Very helpful in general if you are out of office or just want to have a quick view of the market.
1414,sideman59,"July 31, 2014",4,Good app on 5S Good job fitting the data on the phone given the constraints. The 5S loads fast even over cell data. Sliding table entries are a great idea. One nit: the start page should go right to mobile watchlist but maybe I'm missing some setting or other.
1415,polybeerist,"February 3, 2015",2,Please bring back the quick select buttons. I've used and loved this app for years.  
1416,Frank___D,"February 10, 2015",1,Bad Upgrade Still not good. The design management refuses to put back the menu that allowed you to traverse the app quickly. Now there is wasted space where the menu use to be. The design team should be fired for not listening to their users. I guess now they will do what Facebook does which is to create updates every week so the bad comments don't show in the latest release.
1417,77 Topcat,"October 10, 2015",5,"First-class at-a-glance site Crisp, easy to navigate, relevant. Pulls ahead of the financial news pack"
1418,Amex30year user,"March 8, 2016",3,Help New app update force opens pop up adds multiple times to full screen. I'm not even clicking on them or even seeing them in the section I'm reading & they still fully pop up. Unable to find link to email support. Have loved the app for years. Please fix!
1419,mikkeljr,"December 17, 2016",1,"Ruined! The latest update is a travesty that completely ruined what used to be my favorite news app. I can't look at it anymore. The glaring white background and useless space-wasting layout are horrible, but the worst thing is the complete lack of a compact overview of headlines. I have no intention of scrolling endlessly to find a story I want to read. "
1420,YoungG,"October 27, 2008",3,Great platform but very slow I've been using this app for 3 months now. More awesome features have been added but the updating of data has become very slow. It takes more than a minute to download the updated data. This issue needs to be worked on.
1421,Walt Basil,"February 17, 2009",5,"Great Replacement for Stocks Superb stock watcher. Not only does it allow you track your own stocks like the Stocks app does, but it shows you an entire market, or specific news to your own stocks. Advertisments are non-obtrusive. "
1422,josefajis2207,"April 23, 2009",5,"Awesome! This application is excellent. The news, and market prices are super exact and real-time. The only thing that is missing, I think, is a ""Weekly"" graph because from 1 day to 1 month, is a lot. Thank You!"
1423,La Crescenta,"November 29, 2009",5,I use this more than my WSJ subscription Anyone serious about objective reporting on current financial matters needs to down load this app. 
1424,chappo,"October 3, 2013",5,"Wow. Other iOS developers should take note This is how you update an app. Well tested, no bugs, better functionality, useful guidance, thoughtful through and through. Absolutely fantastic work."
1425,Diamondjag,"October 24, 2013",1,Disaster! Type too small...can't see the quotes. In the last version tracking your stocks was great! In this version
1426,Ne-Bo,"October 28, 2013",5,"All of Bloomberg, in your phone Access to all the articles, breaking news and even watch Bloomberg TV makes this app an excellent all around news source."
1427,Vssgm26,"April 3, 2014",5,"Yes please Great for getting info on the go. Plus they update the app often, making it easier to use and drill down to the information quickly."
1428,FaroTheGr8,"April 3, 2014",5,Fast News! This app is awesome!  The news notifications are the fastest in the industry.  I get the real time news minutes before other apps like CNN announce it.  Must have great competence and automation in this company.
1429,Lambo Nut,"April 12, 2014",5,Killer App - LOVE the info! Any gripes I have are minor - grey out of active links is non-standard - otherwise the single most information dense business app - ever. Well thought out organizational structure of info. Both broad AND deep. Impressive.  Five stars.
1430,skwid29,"July 13, 2008",5,Best App in the Store I have had no crashing problems.  I added mutual funds and stocks.  This is the best application in the iTunes store.  I really have to hand it to Bloomberg.  This is almost as good as being in front of a terminal.
1431,cyberbiker,"August 14, 2014",5,"Hugely Comprehensive News & Mkt Source This app is hugely comprehensive, with both news across a broad spectrum and detailed market information. To avoid bias it permits reader comments as well. It has become my news GoTo app."
1432,Blahhgdh,"September 18, 2014",5,"Good app. This app is very reliable, whereas plenty of apps crash or glitch. The interface is very user friendly. I love this app mainly because of the notifications that are sent to my phone."
1433,Ericcurty,"October 6, 2014",5,"Great news app!! Well organized and up to date, this app provides informative news stories in a format that is easily accessible"
1434,Jmpjamf,"December 22, 2016",1,"Be respectful of our time please/terrible update The newly updated Bloomberg app is terrible. They changed the format entirely, making it more difficult to find key data and edit/sort watchlists. Additionally, the app tends to crash on at least half of the occasions I open it. Apparently, if it ain't broke, Bloomberg rebuilds the whole thing. "
1435,J Linden,"December 23, 2016",1,"Pathetic! What happened to ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it!""  This is when we need negative stars for a rating.  How can Bloomberg think that stripping out over half of their features would be a good idea?  Bring back the previous app!"
1436,OG Goga,"January 6, 2017",1,":( wow. Loved the previous app and  Used it daily. The new version is truly disappointing. I am still trying to figure out how to listen to the radio. Something that was so simple and user friendly went away and was replaced with this ""want to be cool"" that looks like crap. The menu at the bottom looks like it's getting cut off. Please bring the previous version back or improve this one I guess."
1437,Tby2000,"January 6, 2017",1,"Bloomberg - this app has got to go This new post-December version of the Bloomberg app is plain awful.  Before Decembers update I used Bloomberg nearly exclusively for all news.  Now, there is no ability to download content, ads crowd out news, and the app repeatedly and frequently crashes.  Honestly have almost stopped reading Bloomberg completely because of how bad the app has become with this update."
1438,ColeGerson,"March 2, 2017",1,Bloomberg's infinite greatness Bloomberg obviously OK'd this TERRIBLE redesign that includes a functionality decline. What makes you think I want to operate on your crazy useless application for monitoring my finances and stocks when your idea of improvement is actually destruction.
1439,Buy_stocks,"April 17, 2017",1,"Absolutely atrocious app - bring back Rev 3!!!!! I am shocked and so disappointed in Bloomberg.  I loved the old app, Rev 3, and used it every day.  It was my go-to app for market news.  Well, long story short, they trashed it and FORCED users to update to the new app.  What a waste of RAM space."
1440,si cat,"August 31, 2009",5,So Good! This ap is so good I feel bad about not paying them anything for it. I have been in the investment industry for 26 years. Load this application and you will be amazed. The best reading on the market you will get. For Free? Thanks Bloomberg!
1441,Mr. Greg B,"December 15, 2009",1,Too bad... Would be great but often doesn't update e.g. last news 4 days old and sometimes stock quotes days old.  Often times out when trying to update.  I can see recent news on Bloomberg website but it does't get updated/picked up on iPhone app.  I'd gladly pay for this app if it updated reliably.  I need to use other apps for quotes and news and they update with current info/data.
1442,BikeSkiCamper,"March 20, 2012",1,"works, until you install patch Loved this app when it worked, then after installing the latest upgrade/version it crashes when I attempt to open.  This happened previously on my iPad, only resolved months later when a new version became available. Now going through it all over again with my iPhone 4GS."
1443,GarbageApp1364567,"October 4, 2013",5,Finally! Got all the little features I was hoping for including lots and dates of purchase. Also finally a server side account to save all your settings.

1447,Woz3.14159,"June 6, 2014",3,Crashing lately App is excellent when it works. I have an iPod Touch 6.1.6 and the app crashes when loading an article over the last week or two. For example I tried to read the article about Christie today - seemed to load the article then crashed.
1448,ghaa12,"June 22, 2014",4,Love it I love the app and it's very useful especially if you are acquainted with their terminal and products. It's useful for me especially when I am out of the office or on a holiday. Although I would suggest improving the exchange rate when adding products to the portfolio
1449,BillWEB,"July 8, 2014",5,"Bloomberg The app provides me with one-stop information that I need. In 5 minutes I can review all the markets needed to make decisions about my growing portfolio. I've used other apps, but this is by far the best.."

1453,PopsDuff,"December 15, 2016",1,"Awful Update I have enjoyed previous versions of this app for years. This new update has destroyed every feature that made it my go-to source for market info and news. Not only does it look hideous, wasting most of my screen with an ocean of blaring white; it no longer has so many of the functions I relied upon to analyze movements in my portfolios. You guys spent a lot of time and money on ruining a good thing."

Not sure why the changes, but the same can be said about a number of the changes as expressed in other recent reviews. Hopefully the issues can be corrected on the next release and an option is available to have the dark background."
1457,PatrickF,"January 22, 2017",1,Doesn't even work Agree with all ratings...new design is terrible - I used to use it daily and now don't anymore at all.  A real shame something as useful as the old Bloomberg could become this useless with one release.

1459,Mcrsnap,"February 6, 2017",1,"Pretty Disappointing! Why did you change the UI on this app? You left the user with no ability to customize the look and feel. I now have to switch from one section to another rather than having currency, markets and news all on one screen. "
1460,Tradryz,"November 19, 2013",1,Prices don't update The new app looks a lot better and the charts are much improved but for some reason it can take DAYS for prices to update (trying to manually update is pointless). Just using google to search the ticker symbol is so much faster it makes this app useless. Sad because its nice to have the world futures markets in on place but when the prices are a day or two old it doesn't matter.
1461,@1stScottESmith,"March 18, 2014",2,"Crash/Glitch Every time I view the top holdings of my mutual funds then select each security to get a quote, the app crashes.  It can crash on the first quote you view or the 5th (there is no rhyme or reason as to when it will crash, but it will).

1471,Fotut,"May 28, 2009",1,Incredibly slow compared to others I used to use Bloomberg daily until I came across Daily Finance and others and I cannot believe how slow Bloomberg is in comparison. I found my stocks updated correctly on Daily Finance but they were not up to date on Bloomberg so I went out to dinner and checked again when I returned and Bloomberg was still not updated. Hopeless and now deleted.
1472,CareerTrader,"July 21, 2009",1,"Worst ap This is the worst ap I have downloaded.  Typical of Bloomberg, technology is all bark, no bite.  If you are an active Bloomberg terminal subscriber, as I am, this ap typically fails to load because there are too many messages data to be handled.  I typically get about 1000 messages a day, and they just flat out will not load.  The whole ap freezes up.  For non subscribers this may be an OK way to see delayed market data."

1477,TheAwesomeOne69,"May 21, 2012",5,"Amazing App This is truly a great app. The push notifications keeps me alerted and on track with current financial news. The best feature however is the free live TV streamer, now I can watch Bloomberg TV on the go!!"
1478,Rosy picture,"October 9, 2013",5,"Great site. Nice new look. Bloomberg is great because of its strong reporting. The mobile app is great because it is easy to use, find reporting of interest, select and read the feeds as they come available."
1479,Markeeymarc,"October 9, 2013",5,"Update version was a downgrade Great app for market info, quotes and news. It was easier and more functional plus better before the update version."
1480,DaveM 6,"July 14, 2008",5,"Very deep app Best app I've seen to date, and the most useful.  Incorporates zoom, pinch, 90degree rotation well with the content and is VERY deep.

1481,Tomas2012,"July 14, 2008",5,"Works great, gorgeous interface This app works great and is beautifully designed. I've experienced no stability issues when adding stocks as some others have reported. Great app!"

1483,CasSantos,"February 18, 2009",5,Great for business I am a financial services professional and this app is perfect. A lot better than the cheap stock app that comes loaded on the phone that I wish I could delete.
1484,EBugaloo,"February 18, 2009",3,"Great app, but the latest update makes it crash upon start up I love this app.  Beautiful charts, feels like a terminal, maybe even better (considering that its free and on a mobile).

At first the were unobtrusive. Now they take up half the page and pop in the middle of me reading and move actual content down. Whoever thought this was a good idea is losing users left and right. I'm done.
1500,Delta investor,"October 7, 2013",3,"Newer version not better but worse. This version crammed more data into a viewing area by decreasing font sizes, which makes the numbers almost invisible on a small screen of iPhone 4 especially outdoors. The previous version was much more useful."
1501,The Sportzguy,"October 10, 2013",1,"Change is BAD! The busy and confusing design and function of this new version is horrible! Previous versions were more visually friendly and functional. Bloomberg, you crammed  an elephant inside of a birdcage. It feels like your designers felt it was a good idea to take the sophisticated iPad version of your app and stuff it into the significantly smaller screen size of the iPhone. I don't like using this version at all."
1502,Gator joe5150,"October 11, 2013",5,Excellent tool to keep up with the market I've been hooked on Bloomberg since my days at Franklin Templeton as a corporate actions analyst.  They were our best source for pricing information and more.  Been hooked ever since.

1512,Jtp1985,"December 30, 2014",5,Best Financial News App Bloomberg has out done the CNBC App. I love the customizable watch list. It's extremely informative at a moments notice. I can see my whole portfolio and where it is via P&L while I'm out of the office. Very smart.
1513,Travelwolf,"December 20, 2016",1,"On mis-reading your audience Bloomberg readers are not Millennials trying to catch up with 140 characters or less.  While the content may still be the same this new format misses completely the way fast moving professionals - their core readership- like to scan all the news and deep dive where it counts.  Now we have one more app with endless scrolling to find the headlines that interest us! Bring back the ""classic Coke""."

1532,ufkm,"October 1, 2009",4,More Bloomberg Anywhere features? Great app and lots of new additions for Bloomberg Anywhere users. Will you be adding the IB Chat feature soon so I don't always have to keep my BlackBerry with me and just be able to work off the iPhone?
1533,beatmixerz,"June 25, 2010",4,I love this app but needs multitasking I love this app and I have been using it ever since it came on the app store. But can we have multitasking features enabled for it. I hate to exit and then come back to the app and find my article that i was reading.

I feel this new app is a tremendous step down from the prior one with the earlier one's excellent display of so much relevant information in a compact easy to find format. I would have been willing to pay a monthly fee to continue the earlier version. I am going to just delete this new version and go elsewhere for the financial information.
1539,Grawn 12345,"August 17, 2017",2,"Thank You Bloomberg, updated 2017: it's just ok. Mobile version of the website. Less navigation options- e.g. no section for muni news. Version from 3-yr was great. "

1545,Kosuub,"July 31, 2015",4,Personal investor The app is a great tool for investing. The one take away I have is that it takes a while to update once the market opens. Sometimes you have to log out and back in to get it to update.
1546,Stardestroyer,"December 13, 2016",5,"Update stinks!!!! Killed my watchlist, news looks like a News app publishing clickbait rather than a respectable business app, requires signin every other click. Update stinks big-time!!!"

You had to work very hard to unleash such a disaster!"

Poor graphics, not easy to maneuver around the site and limited information available on the watchlist page.  Pulling it off and this new app is not recommended."
1597,AnotherSleepyGuy,"December 29, 2016",2,"Awful update I am a Bloomberg junkie but this app has been getting worse with updates - not better. The current version appears to be intentionally designed to be impossible to navigate without accidental ""clicks"" when scrolling through content. I'm sure your advertisers will figure that out."

1599,grob78,"February 26, 2017",1,"Bloomberg should be charged with murder For killing their amazingly helpful, productivity supporting, information giving app. I've been waiting on hopes that with some updates things would return to normal. But alas, poor former app I knew it well. This piece of garbage is unacceptable. I've migrated to another finance app and am leaving Bloomberg behind. It's too bad, because the previous app was genius. This, this is junk."
1600,Manhattim nyc,"March 4, 2009",5,"New version Heard the new version is out 2.0.7 or something like that. When does it hit here? Or do we have to use comp. To get it? Love the app, now just let me view message attachments."
1601,AppleReviewer,"June 7, 2009",5,Great app - indispensible This is a great app for anyone interested in the financial word. They used to have loading time issues though they seem to have improved significantly.
1602,VDH2009,"August 11, 2009",3,"Share Function This application needs to have the ability to ""share"" the stories featured on the application with Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and Myspace. All the other news applications have the ability to repost the story onto one of the various social networks."
1603,Jsfry,"May 1, 2010",5,Great Absolutely brilliant. The more I use it the more features I find - like drillable donut charts for stock indexes. The link from stock quote to relevant news is intuitive. Overall very well thought out.
1604,LRPS AIR,"October 5, 2013",5,Better than before I used the prior version frequently.  The new version has better navigation.  The charts are very useful
1605,Rizznich,"October 11, 2013",3,"Good with only one issue With the current version using and iPhone 5 running iOS 6.1.4, I cannot disable Bloomberg notifications, so at 5am my phone will wake me up to tell me congress hasn't agreed on anything. Great what's new? I've turn off all alerts but still receive them."
1606,Advisor John,"February 13, 2014",5,"Great app This is the first place I check for market info, and to track investments. The amount of easy-to-read info is amazing on a small iPhone screen."

1608,Hijacked399,"June 4, 2014",5,Never had a problem. I have used the app for over two years without a problem.  Love the content. Just what I expected.
1609,MRL59,"June 5, 2014",5,"Best overall financial reporting app Great news push updates, complete market sector reporting and a decent watch list make this the best overall finance app I have found."
1610,MacRules,"July 13, 2008",2,High expectations but low quality software at this time! It is embarrassing to see such a well known name brand releasing software that crashes quite consistently.  The current version should be considered an ALPHA release  and not be available for download at this time.  Please fix the software bugs and release something reliable and stable!
1611,macOSVeteran,"July 27, 2008",5,THIS APP IS GREAT After reviewing this App it is very useful and up to date.  I would have paid for this App but it is free!  Very easy to use and gives you all the market updates.  Thanks Bloomberg.

1613,slapware,"February 14, 2009",4,Update problem I love this application and use it daily. I saw the update available today and installed. Now I see the splash screen with TV and then it crashes without fail. I hope this is resolved soon.
1614,lordwm,"February 17, 2009",1,"Too Slow Overall all this is a good app.  I have two main concerns; 1. it takes a long time to update stock prices, the Apple version that comes with the iPhone is much faster; and 2. the latest update kills the program dead.  It doesn't work at all now.  But when it did work, I liked it a lot, just slow.  Hopefully they will fix it soon and make it faster."
1615,GoGriz,"October 11, 2015",3,Fair topic coverage.  Biased reporting. Broad topic coverage.   Cracked and warped lens used during analysis.  
1616,2097836,"March 7, 2016",2,The pop up ads are awful Pop up ads randomly appear and open a browser window.  Doesn't happen all the time but when it does it is impossible to get through an article. Otherwise I like the other features and navigation tools.
1617,Aabbcc396,"December 18, 2016",1,"What a joke Did you ever blow it with this update. What a complete and utter mess. This was the best app to track news stories, portfolios with analytics, and was pleasant to the eye. Essentially it was an app to be used. This is worthless. All the important features are gone. The watchlist functionality was destroyed. The bright white background is garish and very non-professional. So sad. Now I need to find a new app. Thanks so much."
1618,MJain7247,"December 23, 2016",5,Marketing executive A much cleaner and modern design! Definitely a few kinks to work out but appreciate the much needed update. Looking forward to seeing the new changes!
1619,Ahdjfjeidj,"December 23, 2016",1,Ruined a useful app They have ruined a very useful app. Might as well just look at the website since that is all that you are getting anymore. I'll be deleting this as they have taken any useful information and data out of the app. Now all this is useful only for trying to take advantage of people in the market that are actually using this.
1620,Manolo Music,"May 23, 2014",5,"Can't do without it Terrific data & graphs, current news, and good watch lists. Not sure what all the gripes about font and clutter are all about. This is a must have app for markets & finance."

1624,25or624,"July 21, 2014",5,Bloomberg Review I always look at Bloomberg App when I am looking for accurate information regarding a particular subject or stock price quotes or current company information regarding mergers or acquisitions.
1625,Cash Nasheri,"August 26, 2014",3,Ok but not impressive It's a bit slow in updating the watch list. Sorting stocks Is cumbersome. No access to us yield curve graph.  Transfers graph range to all other watch list items. Does not keep technical analysis for other stocks - once selected. Will not download articles for reading on flight.
1626,Thosspot,"August 29, 2014",4,"Can't beat the news, but It's a little biased toward the left in it's reporting (particularly bloomberg businessweek). Seems weird to be anti-business for a business news site. But otherwise the app itself is good and there is good coverage."
1627,magic711e,"September 12, 2014",5,My Go To Business APP I look at this app about 5 times a day.  It is so informative about anything business.  Also use to listen to Bloomberg Radio all the time
1628,LuckysClub,"January 10, 2015",1,"Horrible, bizarre update It seems Bloomberg's app was just updated by someone who doesn't know what a news app is supposed to do. They removed all access to news categories and now all you can see are the Top News stories selected by editors. It's impossible to jump easily to different sections, so I can't find anything I'm interested in. The app is useless to me now. Delete."
1629,GizzlyAK,"September 29, 2015",1,"This app used to be ok, but ... After each update it gets slower and slower, and the ads more relentless and frequent. It's practically unusable. I can pull up my stocks on Google and use a calculator to figure my balances before Bloomberg gets done showing me ads and displays my data... That is, when it isn't crashing. Don't waste your time. Find another solution like I'm doing."
1630,Outofbounds,"October 22, 2013",4,Last version better. This one just OK I agree with most of the other reviewers that I thought the last version was better. Easier to use etc. 
1631,Bailey blu,"December 20, 2013",4,"Crashes Love this app. However, lately the newer updates just crash the app to the springboard. Tried everything to get it to work and no go. "

1637,Steve H in Florida,"March 22, 2014",5,Not perfect but very good The news feature could be improved. Most sell side analysts do better. The app organization is a little clumsy. But in general it is very good. My go-to financial app.
1638,jsl app,"April 25, 2014",4,Works for me Sometimes this app is a little slow. Overall I give this a four star rating because the information is easy to access.
1639,Thos P,"May 9, 2014",5,Good quick overview Nice way to get a quick glimpse at what is driving financial markets.  Also value world news angle that's missing in some other news sources.

Color scheme is just terrible. In short, everything about this app is disappointing. The old version of the app was a delight. Please bring back the old app!!  Reminds me of the NEW COKE debacle.  Bring back Coke Classic--aka the old Bloomberg app. If not, I recommend everyone just delete this piece of junk."

I don't use the app every day, but it's been one of my favorites. That's all over now. This has to go down as one of the biggest app fails ever. Shockingly terrible design. Totally baffling. Unusable. Giving them one more update to capitulate and restore the old design."
1656,WeirdBlitzBoy,"March 13, 2017",1,"What an awful update As a former professional money manager, I'm a huge Bloomberg fan. The old app enabled me access to the vast majority of their news reporting financial and otherwise. The new app has a terribly revised user interface, which is difficult to navigate. I found myself not using it and I ultimately deleted it. Either do it well or don't bother. Bloomberg ought to yank the free version. It's terrible."
1657,Jpan1234,"March 16, 2017",1,Terrible terrible did I say terrible? I'm disappointed at your new update that limits the data on the watch lists. I've lost the availability to be able to view my overall p and l of my funds and positions. I use to be able to customize my view of my watchlists and other customizations which I value.
1658,Joe Strauss,"May 7, 2017",3,"Great news, navigation kind of stinks I enjoy Bloomberg news a lot and there is great content on the app. The problem is that the app was designed by the Marquis de Sade. The navigation isn't intuitive and it's actually a pain moving from story to story and section to section."
1659,snapper-Z,"July 1, 2017",1,I deleted this app ... ... because it makes it MORE DIFFICULT to read the excellent articles on Bloomberg than it is without the app. I have no idea why Bloomberg wishes to inhibit me from opening articles in Safari where I can zoom in at will. Most media apps permit this. But Bloomberg does not. The only way to do it is to delete the app and bookmark the Bloomberg website. problem solved.
1660,Neuroguy,"January 11, 2015",1,Don't bother I used to look forward to reading this every AM but then they changed the format only to make it more difficult to navigate. The worst of it all was the removal of the comments. Since I actually learned more by reading them. Thank for ruining this app - don't bother with it because they are always changing the format and it just gets worse!!!
1661,Netflixfan,"March 17, 2015",3,Offline reading The app used to download the news when you clicked on the title and you could read them even if you were underground in a subway. With the new updates this beautiful feature is gone.
1662,Airborn35,"July 4, 2015",1,"Data hog I've been using various versions of this app for over a year and all of them have had their issues, but the latest versions use way too much data. All I do is check my watchlist a couple times per day and this app uses more data then any other app on my phone. It uses about 500mb per month just to check my watchlist!"
1663,Antonio200000,"January 25, 2016",1,Really ? This app is becoming more like politiclal junk. Idiotic  personal political agendas / news plague the app.  Whatever happend to markets news and professionalism. I think  I will jump to reuters eikon or s&p iq or markit  for real time and for old news  financial times. Many people use the bloomberg pro only for the messenger anyhow. They have gone ashtrays with pro [ insider trading ] and regular useless political junk news and old market news.

1668,Loganschmidt_573636,"January 26, 2017",1,"Bloomberg Radio Does Not Play When Screen Is Off This is an old problem, and now it's back with the new version.

All other audio apps work that way."

Totally not a fan and will most likely uninstall the app. Would not recommend it to anyone!
1699,Barjets,"January 25, 2017",1,"Worthless! I have used this app for several years, not for the Marxist reporting, but for the market information.

Well done Bloomberg, you've caused your own demise online as well!"

1710,mandrsn1,"February 17, 2009",5,Solved Crash Problem I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it. I then added my stocks before deleting the Apples entry. This program works well now.
1711,BigHaakDaddyAloha,"August 23, 2009",5,"Probably the best app available Access to the most information, very fast, very clean presentation. The most stable news app I have found. Really, really solid app."
1712,iFund Tracker,"March 27, 2010",5,"I like it! This is an excellent tool if you already know your stock's symbol. I only wish it could also research stocks or mutual funds based on catagory (small, equity, foreign,etc) or other criteria."
1713,Tcarter8,"March 30, 2012",5,Crashes trying to view commodities iPod touch. Wish I had read reviews before updating. Is there any way to reinstall previous rev?
1714,Owls!!,"October 12, 2012",2,"Intrusive notifications Well, I'm stumped.  I disabled every possible setting for notifications for this app.  It still insisted on giving me all caps intrusive notifications. Therefore, after several years of using this program, I have to uninstall it.  It has become too annoying."
1715,SherwoodSEO,"March 30, 2013",3,"Latest version is a step back Great content and mostly great usability. But video playback is not so great, with intrusive titles overlayed as the video rolls. Also: autoplay just jumps to the next clip, not to a related clip. Stringing videos together with commercials is not right for this format.  This is not broadcast TV. Repeat: this is not broadcast TV."
1716,ClayPress,"April 15, 2013",5,"Love Love LOVE push notifications Breaking news push notifications alone make this app worth having, let alone the rest of its functionality.  THANK YOU"
1717,Sdbaroon,"October 5, 2013",5,More info/Less space I use this app as an at a glance for info and now a lot more info is available w/o having to look too hard!
1718,Squabulous,"October 6, 2013",5,Love the new version I've always loved this app.   Now I love it even more.   I also appreciate the long business stories.   Most media don't provide the deep dive that is so valuable to investors
1719,Entrepreneur in California,"October 6, 2013",5,Big improvement I especially like the live tv button being on top by default.
1720,niallbva,"August 2, 2008",5,"love it great app, I'm in the business and before I go to bed and first thing in the morning I jump on the very current news to see what is going on."
1721,AppRater,"September 11, 2008",5,Simply put - Fantastic Awesome financial application with slick pages. It would be nice if Apple gives me an option to delete the crappy Yahoo Finance application which has not undergone any revisions.
1722,Enock1970,"February 17, 2009",5,When it works it is good The design is very good and if you are used to Bloomberg the ticker lookup can be a bit weird. BUT is crashes the phone occasionally which is really not cool.  More debugging please!
1723,BobinReston,"October 30, 2016",2,"Too much political bias There can be lots of valuable data available in the app, I'll give it that.  But the political perspective of most of the Bloomberg enterprise is becoming more obvious and much more socialist.  It's interesting to see that one of the leading business enterprises supports more government regulation, manipulation, and those that advocate it over capitalism and enforcement of laws that exist."
1724,Amelia Islander,"December 18, 2016",1,"Wish I had never updated this app! Horrible!  The previous version provided a great, customizable snapshot of news and markets.  Now you have to jump around to find simple things like quotes on stock index futures.  Lots of wasted white space in the news feed."
1725,Hughbellagio,"December 27, 2016",1,"Awful, just awful! For an app that I used daily for the past several years, you've ruined it! The prior versions were easily navigable and gave you a great overview to dig deeper if you desired. The new version from December has ruined it...and try getting to working through your watch list...ha! Always liked your content, but you've ruined your app."
1726,Salerno501,"January 26, 2017",1,"No longer good Previous version was great. Easy to read format. Scale was more appropriate for a phone screen. The new one lacks this all together. Further, this new version now just crashes. Too bad. The previous version, while a little date in style, worked great. Everything doesn't have to look the same. It just has to work."
1727,Mavi300,"March 5, 2017",3,Loved the prev version Can we have the old version of the app back pls? Used to love the ability to listen to radio (minimized) or floating video while reading thru news articles and stock info. The new app seems like a quantum leap backwards! Whoever conceived this!? Very disappointing.
1728,Matt W. 1996,"March 17, 2017",1,"Horrible ""upgrade"" I'm not sure exactly how long it's been, 3 months maybe, but the new version is awful. There is less news, less data, less of everything that made Bloomberg awesome except for ads. I don't mind the ads  like some others but if you're going to sell advertisements, provide a product people want to use!"
1729,EvilCultLeader,"June 5, 2017",5,"Not sure what everyone is talking about. I never used the old version everyone is mentioning but the app is great. It's free, unlike WSJ, the widget works great, and it hasn't crashed on me yet."

1731,Sir Helio,"July 10, 2014",5,"Great for College Students The Bloomberg App is really useful for students like me, it provides useful information about world businesses operations, and financial and economics discussions which enhance our knowledge in these fields."

1734,Paul May 7,"August 15, 2014",4,Great App Excellent to keep track of investments with watchlist. I use the radio a lot when I'm on the go. 
1735,Cpt09135,"September 11, 2014",5,Great for monitoring stocks I use this app daily to monitor stocks that I own and ones I'm interested in.  It's a great app to monitor stock prices and get news and past history on individual stocks.
1736,Jetflyerx,"October 3, 2014",5,It keeps getting better Great app. All you need to keep track of the markets and your holdings plus great access to news.

1739,@PDXclectic,"January 26, 2015",2,Bad update and no more notifications Everyone below is correct: recent updates make navigating cumbersome plus I no longer get news notifications since upgrading to iPhone 6. Please switch back to one click futures access and fix notification bug.
1740,ughh!,"February 17, 2009",5,"Stop whining guys....... If you are having a problem with the update, just delete the application and reinstall it from the app store. It will work."

1744,Duplicate nickname.,"January 2, 2014",5,TV audio. I love the way I could watch bloomberg TV and sometimes just listen to the audio while using my other iPhone apps.
1745,It's Maine out there,"February 25, 2014",5,"Solid I like the updates, info, company breakdowns, and up to the minute news about many many companies. An all around good app."
1746,Bobby Franks,"March 2, 2014",5,Good app for news and bond market quotes Certainly not nearly the functionality of my office Bloomberg but good information and business news
1747,polonium123,"April 2, 2014",5,"Doesn't open This app worked great until the latest update, now it won't open at all. Major fail."
1748,Achulee,"April 3, 2014",5,Good work The app keeps getting better. More data on individual stocks and ETF's will help. Recommending other stories based on user selections will be helpful as well
1749,Sybek,"April 28, 2014",5,Up to the minute news This is my #1 Streaming News Channel for almost 2 years. It just got better! Thank you Bloomberg.
1750,xAV8Driver,"July 15, 2008",4,"Don't delete Apple! Love the app.  Don't delete Apple in the My Stocks section until you have added  your stocks, otherwise app seems to crash.  If you already did, delete and reinstall."
1751,RainbowZebra,"July 16, 2008",5,"Excellent App For power business users, the info you need to stay up to date. Extra credit for being free."
1752,HTUCK,"August 2, 2008",5,Flawless Could not find a better application. I was even surprised on how good the articles were presented. It makes all of the other RSS / NEWS apps seem senseless.
1753,Gamer_075,"August 6, 2008",4,One more thing I'd like to see a link to the stocks reported on in the stories. So when I'm reading about a company I can quickly reference the stock and then return to the article where I left off.
1754,Norman Leon,"August 10, 2008",4,A great free app from Bloomberg.  Just wish... ...one could forward links to their insightful articles to contacts.  This would further spread the good word-of-mouth value of Bloomberg's written content.
1755,digiprod,"September 14, 2008",5,Great and works well This is the way an app should work. Other news and finance type apps should take notice. Works very well.
1756,Nicholas Palmese,"December 6, 2008",5,"Perfect! I love this application, and even though I have no use for it it's great when people ask questions and I can just take out this application."
1757,Tietje,"December 29, 2008",5,"Very useful I'm just now dabbling in the stock market, and I use this app to follow the stocks I'm watching more than I use my computer. Awesome features too. Highly recommended."
1758,a\adfakdjflakjdf,"January 3, 2009",2,"Where are the stocks? Well it has good information on the stocks that it shows, that's for sure, but I have been checking it out for about 10 minutes now and have already found 2 companies that the app cannot find. If this is Bloomberg, they should have every stock imaginable."
1759,Highplainscat,"February 16, 2017",5,Good Not Great Bloomberg seems driven by the desire for additional revenue streams and as a result has produced an app that has more adds and paid services but limited watchlist space as a result I now use Beanstock.
1760,Tumberry,"October 14, 2014",5,Perfect app for business insights This app amazes me as it has my stock market and I follow all business news around the world.
1761,N3ws3,"December 3, 2014",1,"Best UX to track portfolio but... Simple view of quotes, news and performance of group of equities; best app I've found for UI. But *huge* problems: 1) news sources significantly lack compared with other apps; news stale and limited. Many of my tracked stocks have no news compared with other apps when there is 2) quotes don't seem real-time; delay compared with rt on other apps"
1762,Buyyer,"May 18, 2015",3,"On demand is broken On demand in the radio area worked great, but after converting to needing to download to a playlist first (in the latest update) now you can't listen either way; otherwise the app is great. But for me this is a huge problem"
1763,ComprenLV,"December 13, 2015",1,"Ads ads ads and 4 week old ""news stories"" Change topics, an ad pops up. Scroll down, an ad shows up. Make the mistake of scrolling while touching the screen near an ad, app closes, browser opens to load more ads and suggest you download more Bloomberg ads. "
1764,eqtdk,"May 2, 2016",5,Great app!!! I love this app. I'm constantly checking the stock exchange and the news of the day. The live video and radio are on point. I have no complaints about the app.
1765,anidealover,"December 14, 2016",1,"Travesty I'll admit the previous UI had its flaws... And usually I don't stand against change or new app UI. Though this time I must object. The hard-to-read headline font forces my eyes to the ads, which are better integrated and take up way more app real estate than before. I just want to get to the content quickly and I'd like the dark UI theme to make a comeback."
1766,Bbc333,"December 15, 2016",2,"Bloomberg Used to be great, easy to use. Now after latest update it gets stuck on certain pages and I have to close it out and start over.  Everything is harder to find but I think I'm figuring it out."
1767,SABurden,"January 9, 2017",5,"News, fast and up-to-date Does exactly what I downloaded it for, learn to find your sources and read often."
1768,sjs-ch,"January 30, 2017",5,Complete Failure! One of the most useful apps has turned into a cheap looking news app with a fraction of the previous features...
1769,Woomeister,"January 30, 2017",1,"Horrible! I have 2 iPhones and when I updated Bloomberg app on one of them, I realised how terrible the updated version is, so I have relied on the one with the old version.  Today, I can no longer use the older version and am forced to update.  Now I must find an alternative because the new version is simply ridiculous!  There's no simple way to even check on GBP/USD! 😡"
1770,jayberkow,"February 12, 2014",5,"Great App. The latest update fixed issues with the Day Gain, Value, P&L or Cost on the mobile watchlist.  It works as it should and is a great app with lots of information.  Thank you Bloomberg."
1771,Jefemone,"February 16, 2014",5,"Simply The Best I can easily navigate the app, while checking my stocks, etf's, funds, and commodities. How about the world class news team? No better app around."
1772,Joyinchicago,"February 28, 2014",5,Great app Great able to see how both the stock market did and your individual stocks along with how much money you made from stocks
1773,Chicagogreek2,"February 28, 2014",5,"Best financial news app My ""go to"" financial news app in the App Store. Great layout with news, markets, watch list tabs to the left and many corresponding tabs lined up @ the top."

1776,Stock Dan,"July 4, 2014",4,Review I find very helpful and useful tool.  But an omission under commodities I heading of crude oil needs to be added.  Also it was be great if you were able to click on the commodity and get a graph of it as most stocks.  Thank You.
1777,Cesawyer,"July 28, 2014",5,Excellent financial app Best app I have found to get financial news and information. Always where I go first to understand what is happening in the markets.

1780,CapTainAwEs0me,"February 15, 2009",5,"Great app For all you having trouble with the new update, I hear you, I was too. Just delete the app and redownload it. A pain I know but it works perfectly afterwards."
1781,awwskr,"August 10, 2013",3,TWO Problems 1) It would be great of the notifications actually brought me to the article. Instead of the main page. 
1782,LamaRox,"October 10, 2013",2,"Bring back the old I know this sounds nuts, but there's too much content. And there's no 'home page' allowing you to get back to the beginning of the updated news. I find it to be a pain to navigate to find what is important to me. The previous version didn't need a complete overhaul."
1783,Glbncb,"October 11, 2013",4,"Update to Bloomberg I watch this website daily. However, the recent update was a step backwards in my opinion. I would have rated the site at 5 stars prior to the recent update."

1796,eketurakat,"January 25, 2017",1,Horrible layout This went from one of my most used apps to being the least used. The new format is awful and the information regarding the accounts/trades in the past are not visible. There is little use for this anymore. Why is it called an IPad app when its layout is for an iPhone. Horrible use of screen size on an iPad Pro.
1797,Mr E.Z.,"January 28, 2017",1,Advertising getting annoying It's been several months since I rated this app. Now video ads are popping up while I'm reading multiple times. You just lost another star Bloomberg. 
1798,Apersonwritingareview3,"February 4, 2017",5,"Question Seriously, why are these reviews so bad? This is a perfectly fine product."
1799,Andy I1989,"June 15, 2017",1,Resurrect the old version Bloomberg seems to have intentionally watered down their app offerings as part of a larger strategy to focus solely on terminal customers.
1800,okgo,"July 21, 2014",5,"Easy to use app, great content It performs all of the functions I want out of a news app. I've never had any problems with it."

1804,ereddy,"January 30, 2015",5,Terrible update The update eliminated the two most valuable features to me: news by region and push notifications. App is now garbage...hot garbage
1805,Outsideday,"February 19, 2015",1,Garbage This new format fails in so many ways.  What a downgrade.  Spending less time on this app daily.
1806,Louis XVIII .,"December 14, 2016",1,AWFUL UPDATE- BRING BACK THE LAST VERSION Horrible overly-simplified layout where on a tablet is mostly wasted space with a 'smartphone' sized feed in the middle of the screen. Clearly not optimized for tablets; and content seems to be a small fraction of what was immediately visible on the previous version. I've been using bloomberg for years since they launched a blackberry app - PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD VERSION!
1807,BoomerEO,"December 15, 2016",1,"Terrible Step Backward Destroyed a great ipad App with replacement by this mess.  Bad and inexcusable glitches, like printing obscuring data behind it.  Clearly designed for IPhone use, space and flexibility of iPads is replaced by too large, space waisting printing.  The watch list is now only a daily price tracker rather than a useful spread sheet that allows comparison of Long term performance with existing holdings.  Cheap and hoaky."
1808,Gostigi,"December 20, 2016",1,"Frozen out we are The iPad version is not available, unless you pay the $$$ and lease the professional desktop. Despite the always intrusive ads popping up, I enjoyed the iPad version and the chipper morning news and personalities. I have long since cancelled my print subscriptions, and now all Bloomberg apps are gone from my digital world. Way to go, Mike"
1809,John9251763,"January 17, 2017",1,"New app is awful - please bring back old one Once a great app and place to get news on topics ranging from the world to one's stock portfolio. However, they ""updated"" the app to one that is awful. Who gets rid of features? They should roll back to the prior vs. Currently, the news is still good but the app makes it hard to find and read the articles."
1810,Dan Meyers,"December 23, 2013",4,Good but could be better Works great.  I would pay for it if needed.  Would like the option of checking options trading.  I would give it 5 stars and gladly pay more.

1812,Sb-dale,"January 5, 2014",5,Indispensable for business news The depth and quality of news coverage in so many areas is really top notch.  Fabulous!
1813,Ron. C,"February 15, 2014",5,Great App! This is the quintessential news app. They have up to date news articles as well as videos. I love this app and it is very easy to navigate and use. Great app!
1814,Sam An,"March 4, 2014",5,All the latest news on my palm The only negative is there is too many tabs on the top. Should somehow consolidate some into fewer groups.
1815,Dudalpg,"March 14, 2014",4,Great app I love the way this app is current with its news. I am always receiving updates (which is one of the reasons I stuck to this app). 24 hour news on your fingertips. Great job

1817,guylepage3,"April 10, 2014",4,Great content It's not so much the app as the content that is so great about the app. I use it almost everyday. Would like more stock integration as in the iPad app and would like to see a more visually appealing UI. Other than that. Great app!

1820,hitek79,"July 31, 2008",5,"Amazing! I have 3 different news apps, and they are all mind numbingly slow.  Bloomberg is the exact opposite.  It's incredibly fast, and the stock quotes blow the apple app out of the water.  Excellent!!!"
1821,Hairball Tamer,"January 18, 2009",5,"The best financial app i've found Story after story, this app has more interesting and unique content, all easily navigated and accessible, all in one place. WSJ eat your heart out!"
1822,QuickSilver69,"June 27, 2009",2,"Great... even for small investors I don't have a huge portfolio, but this app works great!  I was using the default ""Stocks"" app that Apple provides and it has bugs.  This one is really really nice.  Easy to navigate and the interface is very intuative.  You just can't ask for a better app than what they have delivered here!  Two thumbs up!"

1826,Optionsguy,"October 10, 2013",5,Very Handy This has a nice balance between alerting me for news events short of annoying. I use this more than I expected.
1827,UpState4ever,"October 27, 2013",2,"Could Be much Better The Font size and color is not friendly on the eyes.  The markets screen is a bit confusing, but I found my information.  Can't wait for the next upgrade, hopefully the next upgrade will make the system user friendly."
1828,Ellaae,"November 4, 2013",2,"Bloomberg's New version Agree with others:  this latest version is disappointing and distracting. There is far too much clutter, too many pictures, too many options. I've deleted it until a simplified version becomes available once again."
1829,BlueMooseinSF,"December 22, 2013",4,New Version is Great Improvememt The update is more readable and the market data is much easier to read. The menus for topics is more complicated. I prefer the old format where one could chose which topics were presented.
1830,psshhh,"July 13, 2008",5,This app is great the only thing else I want is a premium app that has features and information that you typically find on a bloomberg terminal
1831,Thayere,"July 31, 2008",5,Excellent! Very well organized and simple to use while still providing a wealth of information. Far beyond default stocks app.
1832,Three steps back,"December 21, 2016",5,"App ruined Used to be one of my favourite apps; most recent update changed all of that. Clumsy, and poor experience. Do yourself a favour, don't update."
1833,Texbat27,"January 15, 2017",1,Worst app update ever! I have never seen a worse update to an app than this. Like others have mentioned everything and I mean everything that was great about the previous app is now gone. I went from opening and using the app several times a day to cringing at the thought of using it once every two days..please fix this.
1834,jb_ca,"January 27, 2017",1,"Won't even launch Been using this app for years. Last year's version was awesome and I used it daily. New version is reskinned to look more like Apple News, which is much less useful than the old ""dark"" UI, especially the watch list UI."
1835,Ebordky,"January 30, 2017",1,"Bring back the old version For functionality and fluidity while moving through the app, the old version was much better. The new version is hard on my eyes because of the bright background. Really like the ability to view everything on one page in the old version. I miss the ticker, too."
1836,JP17791,"February 1, 2017",4,Lost a good market data screen This app is now unusable as a source of market data and news on a comprehensive set of screens. They went from a smart design to a very dumb one.
1837,HHerbinator,"February 3, 2017",5,What happened Used to be very useful and worked well on the ipad pro. Not anymore. The new version is disappointing :(
1838,jrsrodawa,"February 4, 2017",1,Watered Down and Useless My impression after being forced to update is that someone at Bloomberg decided the old app was to good and gave away to much functionality for free. By redesigning the app they hoped we wouldn't notice. This app is useless and I won't be opening it very often moving forward. I guess they are only interested in selling 20k dollar Bloomberg terminals.
1839,Good Griefs,"April 20, 2017",1,"My oh my I don't know why everyone is trashing this latest update. Oh, wait, I do: it's garbage. You would think a developer would let some actual users play with the app before releasing it but that obviously didn't happen. Update for the latest update. Bloomberg is seriously behind in daily mutual fund reporting. NAV is usually a day late with most of my funds. Geez."
1840,YounoMusic,"July 31, 2014",4,Good and informative Has all the information on the market that you could want. Good updates with nice market wide developments. 
1841,Edisto Native,"August 4, 2014",5,Great News App First news I check in the morning and last I check at night.  Best reporting of any news service.
1842,Jrllanes,"August 22, 2014",5,Timely and important I never fail to check the app several times a day. Always ahead of the pack.
1843,Squeek29191217,"September 24, 2014",5,"One of my favorite apps Now that I have this app on my phone, I will never take it off.  Handy, easy to use, my information at my fingertips."
1844,Roteteufel,"October 5, 2014",5,"The best app I start every morning by reading headlines and viewing video reports on this app. When I move to my kitchen, I look at Bloomberg Television. At lunch, it is back to the app."
1845,FIOS fan,"October 9, 2014",1,"What happened? This has always been a 5-star app, until IOS8. The app, after the upgrade, stopped working. When I open the app in my iPhone, all I get is a blank screen, then crash. I deleted the app and re downloaded the latest version. It freezes on the Terms of Service page, then crashes. The iPad app continues to work flawlessly."
1846,Christopher443,"December 18, 2014",2,"Some good content, poor layout The new iOS 8 version is much more cluttered and forces two news categories to the top, where the old style app was super clean and much more customizable. Overall look and feel is now pretty spammy. I used to check this app frequently but won't anymore."
1847,Záchranný Plavec,"February 21, 2015",1,"New Update Blows Chunks This app used to be a great source of news and information - it isn't anymore.  Looks like the useful newsfeed got moved behind a massive paywall, now only accessible in the Bloomberg Professional app. What's left here is a hollow shell of its former incarnation - stale news loaded with puff pieces and useless videos.  This is not the app it used to be - and not the app you're looking for..."
1848,BadBoyzCrib,"December 2, 2015",1,Used to be good - now non-stop pop-up ads This used to be my favorite news app - sadly I have to delete it now as the app is constantly taking me to my web browser to view ads.  Can't get through a single news story now without jumping several times to Safari.  This is why testing software changes is so important.
1849,oscara11,"October 29, 2016",3,Missing 2 big things 1. Why doesn't the tv channels include full episodes of Bloomberg markets? It has full episodes for all other shows.
1850,mcpash,"May 6, 2010",4,"I love it This is by far the most frequently used app on my iPhone. Anyone interested in the volatile markets, stock trades, etc will find this to be fast, accurate and absolutely priceless. To top it, it's free: I would pay for this app."
1851,Joseph Focil,"October 6, 2013",4,"Great app but needs more improvement I love this app I expected this app to have better stock charting, stock displays, year to date performance, and some other simple metrics. It should have more of its bloomberg terminal capabilities"
1852,aajr2,"November 1, 2013",5,Must have business app! This app combines quotes and news. Both are superior to any other business apps available !
1853,Snappytoes to Juniper,"January 4, 2014",5,Top notch financial info/news app This app is terrific and one of the few that I allow to push new posts to me. Never crashes- great range of coverage.
1854,Inspecteur G,"January 31, 2014",5,Go to financial app This latest version has a full set of tools. Take the time to learn and customize it and it will be your go to app.
1855,Jujanapo,"February 1, 2014",5,Great app It is my first time with this tool and I find it quite useful; all the things I need to analyze the local market are in the same place.
1856,bhalo,"February 15, 2014",4,"Review Overall great App with versatile features. Dont like the fact that it doesn't allow to monitor more than 100 stocks. If you want to add more to your list, it asks to delete other stock ticker symbols."
1857,Nollid2300,"March 6, 2014",5,"Solid Interface, Great Content Exactly as advertised, my #1 and most reliable source for news and financial data"
1858,Mambo 19,"June 1, 2014",4,"Great app I rely on this app for all initial stock checks.  It's only limit is the number of technicals available to examine stocks.  However, it is easy to use and reliable!  Thanks for making it available."
1859,New Prediabetic,"June 27, 2014",5,"Best Financial News Site by Far Love Bloomberg for its timeliness, insight, and detail.  If you just want headlines go somewhere like CNN Money. But if you want depth and understanding there's no other place like Bloomberg."
1860,FLHRCI02,"July 13, 2008",2,"Can't find some stocks The interface is nice as well as the graphs.  However, the stock lookup is lacking.  It can't find AT&T.  I tried ""att"" and ""at&t"" and even the stock ticker ""t"", but no luck.  You think they would have tried to find the stock of the company that is the sole US carrier for the device on which they targeted their software.  Gee."
1861,whishihadadoover,"July 16, 2008",1,"Install at your own risk this app crashed my iphone, i have never had one problem....installed this and 30 seconds later...total lock....had to restore.....what a mess.....should be pulled from app store. Obviously they new there was a problem becasue they have already updated to 1.1, but 1.1 is the one that b0rked my phone."
1862,rtruman,"July 17, 2008",5,"Wow! By far, light years away, the best free app on AppStore. Fast, intuitive, rich and polished. I don't trade stocks because I'm not diciplined enough to watch the market. This app is making me rethink my concepts. Great job Bloomberg!"
1863,dickmo,"October 24, 2008",2,"Better than Apple Stock App Includes news and updates much faster and more consistently that Apple own default stock app. It would be nice to have the ability to schedule automatic updates at 1, 5 or 10 minute intervals etc. Some charting choices would also be welcome. Solid app overall."
1864,richshar1,"February 24, 2009",5,Excellent App!!! overall a great app.  This has already replace the imbedded apple program on my Touch...future updates will be beneficial but does exactly what I expected and more.  
1865,tw2Ocean,"April 9, 2016",4,Used to be great.  Now totally broken I used to rely on this app.  I got the new 6S and now the app will not open. Tried re-installing.  App just crashes and closes within seconds of launch.
1866,Raymond578,"December 20, 2016",1,No longer meets my needs One of the things I liked best in the previous version was the large amount of information you could quickly locate and parse. The new version requires much more navigation and time to access even a fraction of what was previously available. It's a mess. Will have to find a replacement financial app.
1867,hattyapple,"February 16, 2017",3,"Bad,Bad,Bad Don't download new version of this App.  Bloomberg App Tech team is run back someone without a GED.  If you download this App, sell your car and buy a horse.  Bloomberg has taken us back to the Dark Ages."
1868,Firehawk 02,"April 26, 2017",1,"DO NOT UPDATE!!! If you are good with current app, do NOT update! It is awful. I lost access to data I used every day! Now I can't go back ☹️️. There should be an uninstall feature for app updates!"
1869,VTIPOD,"June 30, 2017",5,"V4.4 broken on IPad The version updated on 6/30 won't ""come to the front"". When started, hides behind the active screen."
1870,Jamesloom,"June 4, 2014",5,"The only app I use for business news. I use it every day for news, stocks and to see how my own stock is doing."
1871,Nanalovesfootball,"June 4, 2014",5,:) Great place for the latest news and constant market updates
1872,Rob49ert,"June 6, 2014",3,Bloomberg loading speed I'd like an option to shut off the pictures. I only need the news and pictures take too long to load not to mention data cost.
1873,Cary Stockdell,"June 18, 2014",5,Informative and easy to read Just enough info/data
1874,Tesla-LA,"June 23, 2014",5,ACi Architects Best mobile source for meaningful data & news. Continues to improve software features for deeper data access.
1875,Bob Zynter,"July 17, 2014",5,Comprehensive I'm an economist and I need information on a wide range of topics. The Bloomberg app is the one I go to first. They cover pretty much every market and country I am interested in.
1876,Ronronronron,"October 3, 2014",5,"Good stuff, easy to access Check it everyday. Love the breaking news app. Only getting better!"
1877,Foot fetish,"October 5, 2014",5,"Insightful This is an excellent source of info for the market world. They have a great section on new wave if tech, media content . Thx bloomberg for making my stock picks less stressful."
1878,Manfredx,"January 29, 2015",1,"Horrible This is miserable.  The upgrade takes out all the good things about the app and leaves you with very little but ads and crap.  It's free so I guess you get what you pay for.  Trying to find something else now that they've killed this one.  Sadly used to be my favorite app to read news, check futures and get some economic surveys."
1879,MickKassem,"September 24, 2015",1,"Bad update Last update causing problems. If you attempt to get into the app from notifications, it takes you to the correct page but then you're stuck on that page. You can't get off page and back into the app without coming to that page again but nothing else."
1880,Marathon16267,"December 25, 2013",4,Good over all The only problem with this app is that it has no alert setting for when a stock drops below a certain level
1881,jalee51,"January 4, 2014",5,Awesome App I really enjoy reading the Bloomberg app. It has comprehensive market news coverage and the format is well organized and easy to use.
1882,Vcxfg,"January 5, 2014",5,Yowza App is good for dow futures. Good for keeping track of total portfolio in the watch list. Negative is you should be able to include cash holdings so you can get a total of all assets.
1883,MTGMAN1,"January 22, 2014",5,Good timely information Good timely information. This app works much better than the versions before.
1884,GCHB Jerry,"February 3, 2014",4,"Needs a little more info Nice app. I use it all the time. Could use more P&L info and individual stock and total watch list value changes by day, week, month, YTD, etc. Also needs quotes to be real time."
1885,jesusislordamen,"February 24, 2014",5,Tried them all!!!! This is the best app for tracking your portfolio value. It offers customization and is perfect for on the go.
1886,Jlauro13,"April 3, 2014",5,Go to app for news Tons of info and videos. Read it every night and morning.
1887,BuzoLove,"April 16, 2014",5,Really good app Been using for long and recommend it as one of the key apps for financial news and information.
1888,Gjb6,"May 21, 2014",5,Good Great info overall as always. Not easier or faster to check info than prior version.
1889,Dm1462,"June 2, 2014",5,"Most Excellent! Love this site, just wish the numbers were easier to read in a larger font."
1890,Infohiker,"August 23, 2008",4,"Good Product.  Would like to be able to add by symbol For all bloomberg users, this is a nice light app to keep you informed.  I would like the ability to add stocks or funds using the symbol instead of the name.  Otherwise, pretty cool!"
1891,Infoshman,"April 22, 2010",4,"Fast & informative Clean interface. The news I want (except for sports). Suggested improvements: a mail-article button, more headers for news items."
1892,Mwf214,"October 5, 2013",5,Great update Awesome new functionality that let's you see more information than older versions
1893,Mrclaypoole,"October 18, 2013",4,"Great app, old er version better Good info easily available, but it was easier to use and navigate and easier to  read the main screens before the update"
1894,Ikepwr,"October 28, 2013",5,Easy to use Very easy to use. Updates on news around the clock. I also love that it is customizable.
1895,Lancealoha,"December 21, 2013",5,Best New Option out there This app has only gotten better with well written analysis and timely and good coverage of the news.
1896,Bill 99,"December 22, 2013",5,Great job! But one of your updates may have deleted my stock purchase data?  I'm still a fan of this app.
1897,Crazy erections,"January 23, 2017",5,"1 star app Used to be a five star app, and my personal favorite. The update is horrific, and I'm actively looking for a replacement.  The app crashes, and the text size is unprofessional ( at best)"
1898,B from Chicago,"January 30, 2017",1,"Terrible update.... Just an incredibly poor redesign that should cause someone to lose their job.  Roll back to the old version (if you care more about your users than your advertisers).  Love how they forced iPad users to the new version today.  Unless they fix this grand fail, I'll delete this app and move on.  I suggest others do the same."
1899,DonutHunter,"February 1, 2017",1,"Screwed up my every morning market summary Horrible interface now, the shows don't load (the screen is offset and there are no controls), and they won't allow you to use the old app.!"
1900,AlexSP,"August 19, 2014",5,Excelent app I check my portfolio daily on this app. It's accurate and it gives me relevant news all the time. And it keeps improving!
1901,jpintobks,"September 29, 2014",5,Great with iPhone 6 Much improved version. Easy to navigate and good graphics for the larger screen. Highly recommended
1902,aloha_apple,"January 28, 2015",5,Downgrade Old app was better. Easier to see the different news categories and it is as smartly sorted.
1903,GorrilaEater,"June 4, 2016",4,"What happened to the auto read feature? The new version does not have the ""speaker"" icon at top right of each article!"
1904,Eduardojuan,"July 14, 2016",3,Continuous problems Can't think of an iPhone app with as frequent problems as Bloomberg. 
1905,Conan_194,"September 27, 2016",5,Need to have bloomberg calendar I use web to read economic calendar a lot. I'm not sure why the app doesn't have it.
1906,Raider2078,"December 13, 2016",1,New version destroys usability The app went from displaying market data and a list of top articles to a huge useless picture. Now you need to scroll over a full screen down just to see the next article. 5 seconds to get a day's summary to full screen taken up by irrelevant flashy picture and a poisonous shade or purple.
1907,Hanwork,"December 14, 2016",1,"Update ruined app The latest update absolutely ruined the app.  The new ""modern"" white newsfeed takes forever to wade through to get an overview of the news and the market views are similarly inefficient in conveying lots of information quickly.  I will keep the app around to see if they fix it, otherwise I will be deleting it soon."
1908,Yekcutsjs,"December 22, 2016",1,What happened? - I call it a Train Wreck! A total make over which requires several clicks to find my favorites. Screen size is narrow and has fewer columns. Interlaced ads are really distracting to the point I do not even read articles any more on this App. For now I will just retire it to the cloud and check back in a few months to see if it recovers!
1909,PowerIPUser,"January 18, 2017",1,Unbelievable incompetence Used to be my most used and favorite app! It had almost all the information one would need. However since the update it is just rubbish! How can a company like Bloomberg put out an app like this. As an update to what was a beautiful app it is insulting to its users! Bring the old app back even if you have to charge for it!
1910,Jaanamz,"January 22, 2014",5,Awesome Really liked it. Complete user friendly and compatible with social networks. Fast updates with news and quotes.
1911,JeffZ.UMUC,"February 18, 2014",4,Pretty good The mobile app needs to be able to view multiple watch lists. Right now you can only view the default Watch list. Not good.
1912,Jj.Tang,"March 3, 2014",5,"Quick market view, excellent source for news! Love this app! Meet all my needs to learn about the movement of economy and stuck market."
1913,Steven Conners,"March 20, 2014",5,The best business news that exists If you don't use Bloomberg's news and accompanying app it would be unfortunate due to their comprehensive reports/reporting.
1914,BB Seattle,"June 2, 2014",5,Bloomberg Slower access time then previous version but amazing amount of data
1915,DJ_Shark,"June 3, 2014",2,"Not ready for prime time News section on stocks is terrible.  It's incomplete, outdated, and often completely irrelevant (check out news on TTPH, antibiotics company, where the only news item is about the Boston Marathon Bombing from over a year ago)."
1916,Dr Eliot,"June 22, 2014",5,"Nice update, well done! But... Lots of info packed into a small space. Easy to navigate."

1919,Mae1209,"August 10, 2014",5,Very Detailed / Easy To Use App Provides accurate info in an interface that is easy to use and navigate.
1920,MacPHC,"October 5, 2013",4,MGT Best stock app that I have. The only thing they don't have is a capital gains disposition file. 5 star at that point-on the watch list you can put the buys in the form but not the sells. This would be the ultimate showing profit or loss
1921,Reed Eckhout,"October 6, 2013",5,Great app! Brand new interface and more organized layout provides a better experience!
1922,Tobyblur,"October 6, 2013",1,"hard to access most read news I love the most read news but they, like WSJ, decided to make it difficult to access thru mobile device.

1925,ShortiePT,"October 19, 2013",3,This Version is Better I prefer this new layout compared to the old.  I find it easier to read and like the aggregated total net return and the daily gain/loss.  This is much better than the old version in my opinion.

1928,Mmcmah,"November 18, 2013",1,"Totally screwed up with new version Ever since the app was redesigned, it's awful. Too busy, too heavy (data-wise) and not customizable enough. You used to be able to cache all the messages and then red them offline. Now it only download some messages and not others. MUCH preferred the older version and would prefer a return to that format."
1929,Blahmcduh,"December 27, 2013",5,"Works for me Quick response. Shows every thing I need at a glance: status of markets and my stocks. If I need to dig deeper, it's fairly easy to find with a few taps."

1936,DHIbach,"December 13, 2016",1,"New Update Ruined it The latest update ruined this app for me.  It used to have everything you needed to see on the opening page, News, Indexes, Currency, etc.  a nice quick glance look.  Now there is a separate page for each.

1938,Mik88488,"December 16, 2016",1,"horrendous update I'm deleting this app.  This latest update offers nothing off the great features that I had come to love about Bloomberg (great in breadth of world and business news, ability to do look up some stocks).  Now the interface is clunky, there is very little selection for news articles, and too much political ""views"".  Epic fail!!"
1939,JTH2121,"December 20, 2016",1,Awful update Who thought it would be a good idea to not allow tv or radio to run when your phone is locked? Update also does not allow radio to run while other apps are being used. This app is also so convoluted now with media options and headlines it's hard to use. Long time daily-user now looking elsewhere.

1948,K. Harvey,"April 28, 2015",2,Lots of Potential but terrible execution This app typically doesn't update until around 9:45 am this providing zero insight into the markets in early trading hours.

1951,adotjdot,"October 18, 2013",5,Best market news in mobile! Dedicated to making the best app for iPhone. Bloomberg is constantly improving the app...live video can't beat it.

1954,AFYTXR,"December 25, 2013",4,Last version was better Too complicated and not as intuitive as last one
1955,NYU73,"January 8, 2014",5,"Awesome Great app. Read it every morning, no problems with crashing or not loading. A lot of awesome content at no cost, unlike Wall Street journal"
1956,Mlhanlon2000,"February 14, 2014",5,Very helpful I check the app every morning and the news helps me stay on top of things.
1957,NoleMet,"February 24, 2014",4,Great app Excellent app with access to a vast amount of data.  Would love to see a better developed ability to track portfolio performance than just a 'watch list'...
1958,munymgr,"April 9, 2014",5,Best all-in-1 Financial App Combination of wide range of market quotes coupled with both text and video news makes this my one stop to get financial info.
1959,Ckbrown1982,"April 12, 2014",5,Because u ask me a hundred times I would give u a one if I didn't think it was not fair to the rating system
1960,JusticeFries,"July 24, 2008",5,"Great app Great app, but when will the professional tools be available for bloomberg anywhere users? I'd love to be able to pull up all of the same features I can on my workstation. CUSIP searches, YA, YAS, GP, DES, and GIP are all musts!"

1963,iPhone user4422,"October 28, 2015",1,"user experience getting worse What was a very good, functional-easy to use app has now been packed with advertisements, too much info and ""clunkiness"".  Keeps freezing after a period of scrolling down require restart. looks to ""busy"" trying to pack in so much stuff on screen.  why they have to make it so complicated ?"
1964,Cnxguy,"December 18, 2016",1,"Is there a way to roll back? Aside from being buggy wrt font size, most of the info I tracked on my watchlist has disappeared (can no longer swipe left on watchlist to see my other data fields, for example). If I can find a way to ""roll back"" I'll stick with Bloomberg, which was my favorite stock app. If not, it's going to the trash."
1965,riccko,"December 21, 2016",1,TERRIBLE! You went from 5-stars to 1-star overnight!
1966,Mikot1,"January 12, 2017",5,Crashing I'm not sure what changed. The app crashes after a few seconds. Don't they do any testing??????
1967,jd2020,"January 24, 2017",1,"Terrible bloated, annoying app Terrible and unprofessional. This app reflects poorly on Bloomberg. It delivers some of the worst banner ads. Bloomberg's app has sunk to the bottom of the barrel. "
1968,Borscht,"January 31, 2017",3,"Need to like it again After over 20 years of being conditioned to the black/orange onBloomberg terminals and the app, I will need a Long time to get used to the new look. Dark letters on white background is def friendlier on The Eye. Perhaps orange is gone due to the orangutan in the White House..."
1969,DPDXB,"March 31, 2017",5,Disappointing There was nothing wrong with the previous version
1970,_yc_,"April 4, 2014",5,Nice feature-rich application. This app is well-designed and provides a lot of information.
1971,cfred14,"April 21, 2014",5,Very good Occasionally some lag but overall good performance.  Good way to keep up with news and the market on the go
1972,Turkeytimes2,"June 3, 2014",5,Bloomberg Clear simple lines; does what it is designed to accomplish; fast and easy with room for all necessary data.
1973,Leilani327,"June 6, 2014",5,Great for a quick check Ap makes it easy to check on financial activities and portfolios.
1974,Bvortex,"June 24, 2014",5,"Good App, better format needed Good App, better format needed.  Very clunky are areas of finding articles or even looking up ones are non apparent."
1975,Bapa Nam,"August 2, 2014",5,Daily Essential I check Bloomberg first thing in the morning and last thing at night.
1976,Spangler Tukle,"August 10, 2014",5,Better than the real thing Few apps exceed the convenience of the original. Such a pleasant surprise.
1977,Delusionsofadequacy,"September 7, 2014",3,"More work to do. The timing and depth of the stories/market news is good. However, too often the about hits take the opportunity to editorialize hard news stories. Bloomberg can do better, it's expected."
1978,Rajiv Sondhi,"September 20, 2014",4,"My only news app of choice Every morning, this is my news app of choice. I like the combination of video and text on an easy format. Economics news is comprehensive."

1980,Domrep7,"February 14, 2009",5,Where is QC? I too had to delete the App and reinstall it again and lost all my setting to use the new update! What's going on?
1981,Brewmister,"March 4, 2009",5,Radio Love the app. Would rebuy every year for $10 if it included bloomberg radio. Seems to be the only feed you can't play on an iPhone.
1982,mEOwMicks,"November 27, 2009",4,Great app and lots of info This app is great for market buffs and combines news with market stats. Sometimes it hangs but most of the time works like a dream. Probably requires a bit of market knowledge to use.
1983,John St.,"February 12, 2010",5,Business news and stocks data If this is what you're looking then this app must be installed on your phone. It's great.
1984,Kim Fox,"May 19, 2010",4,Cool app This app is far the best one of its kind !
1985,yapy05,"September 28, 2010",4,Could be better Awesome app! One thing though is the limited number of functions as compared to the actual bbg terminal. Doesn't even have a page for economic indicators/ releases
1986,Jdm52,"March 25, 2012",4,Crashing My Bloomberg app had the same bugs as everyone else here just try deleting it and redownloading it and the app should work fine

1990,Preacherkeith,"August 5, 2008",5,Pastor Awesome program with a value - free. I have placed a list of about 15 stocks/mutual funds in the list and can keep an eat overview of each at the touch of my finger - amazing :^)!!
1991,Greenwc,"August 9, 2008",4,Great app This is a great application but two possible updates:
1992,MacHead 84,"August 20, 2008",5,Bloomberg This is one of the best designed and functional apps out for the iPhone for business and financial news.
1993,Kenny2525,"September 11, 2008",3,"Great app but.. ..please get rid of these annoying adds at the bottom which are there since version 1.2. Also, please make the news section more customizable and offer more news feeds. Thanks"
1994,Stomper walks,"December 21, 2016",2,No live tv I used to like this app. Loved the TV and the radio. Was able to listen to them in real time while doing other things. Now this app looks just like a regular website. And those features are gone. I will more likely than not delete this soon.
1995,Akaidoragon,"December 28, 2016",1,"Break it for the fun of it, thats the new update I would give zero star if thats possible. The update make the watchlist useless. Previously I can track 4 currency, now only 3 in the table format, but hey, i dont even see any numbers at all. I will start a petition to get the apps developer fired is possible too. Cant believe a great company release such an apps."
1996,coc29,"December 28, 2016",2,"From savvy to dummy Bloomberg has always been a great source of information, with everything you want in one simple screen. Now, they've simplified the interface so much that you'll need to go to 5 screens to get what you used to get from one before. Total disaster!"
1997,Natattackninja,"February 7, 2017",1,Update terrible for usability It IS as bad as everyone says. Impossible to filter the information you need. Layout is the polar opposite of intuitive and color scheme does not lend itself to readability. Bloomberg please just give us back the old app!!
1998,Lab walker,"March 12, 2017",1,DISASTER Or should I say a total waste of my time! This used to be a worthwhile global read especially in times of crisis. And I'm not one to even bother writing bad things about useful services. This is such a reversal of a decent product that I felt compelled to echo the discontent of the majority of recent reviews. I would have given it a negative 5 stars were that possible.
1999,Stephensos,"June 24, 2017",4,"Terrible Used to love the app and look at it hourly. It's now become terrible, showing less and hard to use. Please give the old version back."
2000,Gopher80!,"October 14, 2014",5,"Plenty of good info Just did the update on my iPhone 6. Audio, video and articles all are pulled up effortlessly. Wide range of topics covered with this app."
2001,Jeffrey Dickerson,"January 15, 2015",1,Navigation Update Ruins App I work in the Energy industry and primarily used Bloomberg for the ease of finding industry-specific news. Now I have to manually scan through all news articles for relevant articles? I don't have the time or patience for this change. If Bloomberg doesn't fix this I will get my news elsewhere.
2002,Okaria 69,"January 22, 2015",5,Owner Toss out the last revamp. Too difficult to navigate and way too many pop ups.
2003,chuckwellborn,"November 21, 2015",5,"Love it Read WSJ every day for 35 years. Murdoch ruined it, lost credibility. Grateful to have credible business news well researched, written and edited. Don't like ads but nothing worthwhile is free."
2004,Orelodnab,"December 15, 2015",1,"Pathetic You would think a name like Bloomberg would offer at least a mediocre app. Every time I open the app, a pop up window tells me to update to the latest version. I already have the latest version installed. The pop up freezes the app and takes me to the App Store. I can't use this app anymore, literally..."
2005,Satya Dixit,"April 22, 2016",5,April 2nd version crashes at start. Does not recover A great application became unusable. Crashes on iPhone 6. I do not know other platforms. Please fix. I miss this App.
2006,dhimasernowo,"May 3, 2016",1,"Watchlist doesn't work I've been using this app since 2015 for its watchlist feature, it's fine at first, but since the couple last month, this feature is buggy and not accurate for example : calculating day gain,, please, if your app not ready, don't publish to App Store, I personally don't mind to wait for ""working version"""
2007,sbj-in-az,"December 14, 2016",1,"Really terrible version Wow, this iteration of the Bloomberg app's design is breathtakingly awful.  On iPad, in landscape or portrait, it wastes about 50% of the available screen real estate with big, blank gray bars with content only in the center.  Way more ads too.  Much less useful and functional than previous versions.  Find a different finance app..."
2008,Ishshsushehe,"December 15, 2016",1,Very Disappointing Update I wish I never updated this app but now it's impossible to reverse. No more option to play in the background for the live TV. What's worse the watchlist is useless now. It shows the daily change only and I now have to find an alternative for my personal investment management.
2009,Leighphx,"December 16, 2016",1,"Wish I could undo the update Everyone else has said it, this new version is impossible to navigate and I can't even find the information that used to be so easy to access. I didn't intentionally update it either, it just changed a few days ago and I literally hate it. I will delete the app."
2010,Martell8190,"February 7, 2014",5,Excellent app! Great app for those interested in the markets. I like the ability to watch live tv as well! Overall great app with awesome news stories.
2011,SueBruce1,"February 18, 2014",5,"Simply the Best Up against the other majors, this app is the gold standard. Easy to read white letters on a black background, continually updated, written with clarity."
2012,Bulletmarcos,"February 21, 2014",5,Excellent app It has everything you may need related to basic financial data.
2013,Alex2643,"March 3, 2014",4,The logo I like the app but the logo of the app icon leaves something to be desired. It does not really embody of what bloomberg is a data terminal. Thompson reuters got it right you will as well. Anyways my only complaint for now.
2014,Heather & Laurel,"May 7, 2014",5,One of the Best News Apps We check Bloomberg everyday.  The coverage is comprehensive and the app works well.  It is simple hard to beat.
2015,Charlescyu,"June 2, 2014",5,Good Could be better. 1) make video a separate channel 2) less news in overview section
2016,nas & wes,"June 12, 2014",5,"Excellent, as always Great access to stories and information. Always improving."
2017,Plangent,"July 2, 2014",5,"Useful news and market info Some general news and opinion too.  Works well,"
2018,Arturobhs,"July 17, 2014",5,The news and the stock monitor Both are excellent I would even say outstanding
2019,JR Baker 0914,"August 7, 2014",5,Most Comprehensive Financial App Everything I need right at my fingertips to cover all the markets I trade. Appreciate the news without all the hype/BS of other sources. Just the facts ma'am.
2020,JVsqz,"May 7, 2010",1,"Constantly crashing I got this app after reading the review on it, but I got disappointed. After I downloaded it and start using it, immediately start crashing at the moment of updating the charts. I have got several update with the hope they will fix it only to further disappointment. I gave it one star."
2021,Ertyuip,"March 24, 2012",5,Thanks for the fix!!! Working again after the previous defective update... It's still my favorite financial app!
2022,ziadlovesthismusic,"March 26, 2012",1,The update and the fix to it still crash I don t know if it is the addition of videos to the news section that caused this or probably some rushed programming. Like a previous commentator mentioned this is unacceptable from a firm like bloomberg. It is obvious that thorough testing wax skipped as this is wide spread. Please remove some bells and whistles and get this working again.
2023,Dwolfe46,"October 8, 2013",5,Improved ads Much better now that the user can close the ad banner. Thanks.
2024,Kassi1234,"October 23, 2013",4,My favorite business app Although this app provides a huge amount of data it can be challenging to locate exactly what you are looking for.
2025,theFLASH02,"November 11, 2013",5,Best Version yet Really easy to scroll through all the familiar sections you see on the desktop version
2026,Amolotov,"December 14, 2013",3,Excellent app This was my number one business and finance news app. It longer is because you can no longer download content for offline viewing. Please change it back.
2027,Mortakye,"December 21, 2013",2,"Detest the update Loved the ability to view basics with one line per stock in previous version. This version is similar (if not the same) as the iPad app. Great on the iPad but of limited value on the iPhone. I'm moving to Stocks Live. If I am forced to take multiple actions to check stock basics, may as well do so on a superior app."
2028,Jpvpvpv,"December 23, 2013",4,"Excelent portfolio stock app Recommended, but in the latest update I couldnt get my portfolio to be seen in my countrys currency. I dont know why they took that option. "
2029,Buratlee,"December 23, 2013",5,"Bloomberg  - simply the best From news coverage to the most thorough data, Bloomberg is the final word in financial news and information."
2030,CorpX,"July 13, 2008",5,"Great App! But I am also ecountering crashes when attempting to add a stock to my stocks.   Even without that funtionality, it beats the stock app that ships on the 2.0 firmware.  would be nice to add stocks though.   Great job!  RECOMMENDED!"
2031,Michael_B_,"July 13, 2008",5,"The industry charts are fantastic! Well done, I an looking forward to more features being added."
2032,ragheehorner,"July 13, 2008",5,A must have for market-watchers! The first App I downloaded...awesome horizontal charts.  This App alone is reason to have an iPhone & now I don't have to be jealous of my buddies with blackberries.
2033,Gizmo geek,"August 1, 2008",5,AMAZING!! I'm hoping that they add extra security features to protect sensitive data like no. of assests you own and their value.
2034,Garibaldi001,"September 20, 2008",5,"Wonderful app... Works perfectly, but I'd like to track stock options...Can anyone help me with with where to find option ticker symbols?"
2035,rocknrollercoaster,"October 3, 2008",3,"Almost there Obviously, this is an outstanding application. I would give it 5 stars except for the following:"
2036,MKEDayTrader,"October 22, 2008",4,Best App Yet It would be very helpful if it were to total you stock holdings at the bottom of the screen.  Would definitely appreciate that in the next update.
2037,bluespeed,"February 19, 2009",4,Crashes every time Newest build 2.0.6 crashes every time I load it.  It worked fine before.  And there is NO support site for this app.
2038,bmckelvey,"April 29, 2010",1,"Can I was hoping this app would allow me to see some securities that I track in my BB Portfolio Tracker, like LIBOR, swaps, sovereign CDS, exchange rates, cap vols, etc. That's fine for people only looking at US equities, but I was hoping for more as a BB user. Instead, it actually manages to offer less than the native Stocks app. Pointless, given that you have expanded functionality on the mobile BB website."
2039,Tbgone,"June 6, 2017",1,"Why did they make a great app so useless? The Bloomberg app gas been getting harder to use for some time now, but now they have destroyed the currency feature. It no longer reports the rates it has for so long, and it appears to be impossible to get a USD/EUR rate, only the inverse.  If anyone knows of a useful current markets app, as Bloomberg used to be, please post it here."
2040,Former Bloomberg user,"December 20, 2016",1,This has changed my life. Bye bye bloomberg I can't tell you how upset I am with the changes. I used this app daily on my phone while working and during lunch. I'm so upset I'm no longer watching Bloomberg when I get home in the evenings. I now watch CNBC. Who ever thought that THIS is what the users wanted should be looked at real hard come review time
2041,NelsonAponte,"January 11, 2017",1,How to go from great to worst in 1 update I'm lucky I had to restore an old backup and I got the old Bloomberg app!!
2042,Single Magpie,"January 21, 2017",1,Awful Update to What Was a Great App Why did you update your app? The last version was one of my favorite apps. I referred to it at least daily. The updated version is a horror.
2043,Will400,"January 25, 2017",1,"What happened to this app? This new version is awful...You used to have a nice summary of basic info...your favorite stocks, a quick overview of currency markets you watched, the lead news stories.....now, it's fragmented, hard to navigate, and just plain clunky....the big makeover they performed last year was a miss and hasn't improved....."
2044,3500078217,"January 31, 2017",1,"Screwed up watchlist The new version is terrible! The watchlist is completely screwed up. I can no longer see my total gains or even a summary of my holdings, it's just symbols and daily gains. The watchlist made this app the best financial app on the market, this update completely trashed that image. Please, I beg you to bring the features of the old watchlist back!"
2045,Joyous Joel,"January 31, 2017",1,"Relied on Previous Version But this one useless. Liked the density of prior version.  News headlines alongside market info.  Used multiple times overnight for foreign markets and good news stories. I had used CNBC only Pre-market for S&P500 future that showed index change, not just future change.  Now I'll use CNBC for all info on foreign markets and news.  Regretable."
2046,megalaser,"February 2, 2017",1,"Appalling totally ruined unusable What on earth have you done, absolutely dreadful. Finally had to update to this backwards app that looks like it's been designed by a 16 year old because they now have a pop-up message on the old app preventing it to be used. I am switching over to MarketWatch Who have what is closer to the old Bloomberg service. Goodbye Bloomberg."
2047,Seals Family Computer,"February 12, 2017",1,"Bloomberg Bombed The functionality of the Watchlist is nearly unusable. You are frozen on screens that will not allow you to return; you are caught in ""chart hell"" where you can't return to the Watchlist. If I can't navigate market data easily I have no use for Bloomberg mobile. This is horrible compared to the previous app."
2048,Kioshi Sangwu,"February 26, 2017",1,You have to be kidding This can't be for real. This is not an upgrade. They completely destroyed the app. The only thing that makes sense is that they did it on purpose because they plan on coming out with a pay version that is probably the same as the old version they just replaced. What a joke.
2049,sukittrebek,"March 14, 2017",1,From favorite app to the next one I'll delete. All I can say is that there are other apps out there from companies that make them better and not send them back to the Stone Age. This app looks like it was someone's quick first draft.  Standards seem to have changed.  I wish there was an option for 0 stars.
2050,Mb5719,"June 16, 2014",5,"Excellent source of news One of the few news agencies that produce excellent stories, not only U.S. Based, but from all over the world. Great reporting."

2053,avf4ever,"July 25, 2014",5,Bloomberg review One of the few apps that allows overlap graph comparisons with smart phone software presentation not having to use borrowed PC screen conversions. The comparison graphs are easy to review.

2055,CAFCU,"November 18, 2014",1,"Crashes my New Ipad...blew away my photos November 18, 2014:This app constantly, constantly, throws errors in the posting sections. This app is sorely unstable and crashes iPad on a half dozen occasions. Somehow it wiped most of my photos. Make sure you have your stuff backed up in the cloud before you run this....fortunately I had backed up and only lost my most recent vacation photos."
2056,Mooneyguy,"January 8, 2015",2,Battery killer I don't know how they did it but this app now consumes more battery than everything else combined within a few minutes of opening. So bad the icon 5s gets warm to the touch. 30% of battery gone within 15 minutes. Ridiculous!
2057,zhsdu,"January 8, 2015",2,"No breaking news notifications There has been no more notifications since I got it for my new iPhone 6 plus, which has never happened on my old iPhone 4, iPhone 5 and iPad. Hope there will be an update to fix this issue."

2059,Skadyk,"December 13, 2016",1,"Terrible Update I'm coming from the perspective of using this app to monitor stocks and the update really stepped backwards. You can no longer sort holdings by symbol, gains, or total value. The watchlist screen no longer displays the total value of your individual holdings or your long term gains/losses, it only displays 1D gains. I'm in the market for a new tracker as of today."
2060,Bob 76059,"October 10, 2013",5,Best in the Business Bloomberg has clearly crafted the easiest to use and most informative business app.  Highly recommended!
2061,Zoom works,"October 15, 2013",4,Fantastic This app is amazing especially during economic crisis. It is as if the Mayor himself is keeping his namesake on course. I like the live newsfeed. I hope that the budgets increase so the programming becomes more consistent and world class.
2062,YouHeardItFromRob,"October 23, 2013",4,"Quintessential Reminiscent of the Bloomberg computer I use at work and unobtrusive on my phone.  Bloomberg is the AP of financial media, like it or not. Put it on your phone so you can be up to date."
2063,Elmont14,"December 28, 2013",4,Vital Info I enjoy reading the vital info about the news all over the world. It also helps when u need to read on the go without interrupting your pace

2065,jack.of.all.trades,"February 19, 2014",5,The best Whether you are using the app or your Bloomberg terminal there is no financial news service that comes close.

2072,vpasman2,"February 15, 2009",1,"Wish they did more testing Just upgraded to 2.0 and the app crashes any time you push the button. Deleting and reinstalling the app solved the problem, but after a disgusting bug as this, not everyone will go back using. I did, but it tells you how much testing was put into what is otherwise a decent app."
2073,Jbeanstrader,"February 16, 2009",1,Bean Counter Worst update ever on any app. Especially one this important to so many people. I would rather have the phone stop working as an actual phone than not have this bloomberg app working correctly. How the hell did this update become available in this state of instability? All I have left now is hate...

I used to live stream the Bloomberg tv in the background to see what's happening and watch the armed movers. Notice a common theme, ""used to"" because it was taken away in an automatic update. Know how your customers use your product when making updates."
2086,IR73,"December 17, 2016",1,Total disaster! I cannot believe Mike would allow this abomination of an app to ever launch!

2087,ZAP345,"December 23, 2016",2,"Barely useful The old app provided more information, it suffered from a very poor layout. It made it hard to use. Bloomberg never fixed it, instead we get a new useless app displaying a little information that can be got any where. Uninstall."

2200,nsnook,"March 10, 2013",4,"Good, could be much better for stocks I go to this app for 70% of my financial news."
2201,Traveler4776432,"September 24, 2013",3,"Great app, but push alerts gone! Love this app, the video and live TV are amazing while traveling or at the gym.   But it would be 5 stars if the push news alerts came through on the phone.   Works on iPad (push alerts)."

2208,mikechavarria,"October 17, 2013",4,Clean Interface Very easy to use interface that is clean and also easy to read. I just wish it offered realtime action!
2209,Nick 512,"November 7, 2013",5,Currency I would love to be able to look at currency movements over time like you can do with shares.
2210,Surfer99,"July 10, 2008",4,Great app Great app. Lots of promise. Only improvement would be the ability to customize the time frame in the stock charts. I believe you can only view a one year chart.
2211,jdcochrane,"July 14, 2008",4,Great App Much more indepth than the basic stock app that apple gives you.  Highly recommend.  A little slow however
2212,omidkaab,"August 4, 2008",5,Fantastic and Useful! It's obvious the developers put some thought into this and it really paid off.
2213,Leadfeet,"December 28, 2008",5,Very creative & awesome ;) Better than going to yahoo for stocks. Although it did not have much news or info on Africa.
2214,westfoto,"February 17, 2009",5,Works great! This program works great.  But you have to download it via the computer not the phone!
2215,TheKL,"April 6, 2009",3,"Great potential, but too slow to use This is a great app. However, it loads data so slow, even over wifi, that I hate using it. Unfortunately, it is the only good financial news app out there."

2220,GiovanniNYC,"December 13, 2016",1,New version a dud This latest version now requires you to create an account to see your watchlist - meaning provide an email so you can get more spam. The new layout is unintuitive and awkward compared to previous version - and of course ads are now more prominent. Will be looking for a new business/stock app.
2221,Bollanger1,"December 17, 2016",1,"Horrible update There was nothing wrong with the previous version, but once again you let a designer go crazy, now rather than a concise app that uses all the ipad screen space efficiently, I have an app with a bunch of stupid tabs, and a ton of white space, and no rhyme or reason for the layout, why why why....."
2222,S786S,"January 3, 2017",5,Worst update Clunky interface. Zero stars. Previous app was way better
2223,Foodhurtsme,"January 24, 2017",1,"What happened!? Who stole my Bloomberg!? Okay, so updates happen, but do you have go backwards when you do an update?? This was a nice app on the iPad, but now it's like running the iPhone version on top of my iPad Pro. What's the point? Don't know who made this decision but it needs to be reversed ASAP. Make an iPad Pro compatible version (12.9""). Not acceptable as is."
2224,Greg12344,"January 31, 2017",4,Rubbish This used to be an amazing app but not worth downloading. Bloomberg has simplified the watchlist and its now unusable. Who knows why the chose to ruin a good thing and destroy their band name. Don't waste your time downloading it.
2225,Dontaskforareview!,"January 31, 2017",1,"RJ VP No functionality with the upgrade. What a total piece of junk! Never sure what moron gets tasked with this job that completely ruins a decent product. My guess, the same clowns that blew up Yahoo finance! I will delete and seek other options. Finally, as others have said, the lefty, progressive, news push just added insult to injury. Priceless!"
2226,BbObserver,"February 1, 2017",1,"Bloomberg went mainstream... :( This version is terrible - pure junk. Bloomberg used to be pure business and this is just plain rubbish! If you want to become a ""news"" app, create a separate one. This is garbage and you will alienate all original users. Bring back the old format and black background! This one makes my eyes sore and distracts my mind."
2227,Nomo1,"February 18, 2017",4,Unsatisfactory The current version is unsatisfactory. Why oh why did you ever change it? Please fire the programmers and bring back the old version.
2228,L'ours grande,"February 23, 2017",1,"Totally frustrating The pre-update version was great-very readable, intuitive, easy to use. The new one is terrible. For example: Create a watchlist, add some stock positions, pick one, then choose a performance period (3 days for example), and look at the graph. Now, try to get bacak to your watchlist to look at another position. Impossible."
2229,HairyBB,"February 28, 2017",1,"App is HORRIBLE The app is absolutely useless now, everything that was good is now gone. The fact that you not listening to your users and keep updating this ridiculous, useless app make me hate the entire Bloomberg brand. Bring back the old one.

2236,Maple 118,"December 11, 2014",1,"Review App is at least thirty minutes behind real time trading!! What's the point if it's that far behind?! Plus it takes six hours after the days closing trading session for the app to cycle your profits or losses in you watch list. I like the platform, but with it being so far behind real time trading then what's the point??"
2237,DaddyBodner,"January 6, 2015",5,Excellent Comprehensive All the market data from commodities and currencies to stocks and news. This app is all you need.
2238,jkreviewer74,"February 8, 2015",2,"Seriously? This latest update went in without anyone realizing that Liabilities was dropped from the Balance sheet graph and Net Income was dropped from the Income Statement, to mention the most obvious issues.  Isn't Bloomberg synonymous with financial information? This latest update is a fail.  Please fix!"
2239,Kelvin chanky,"December 26, 2015",1,"Terrible popup ads The app used to be good, until they decided to incorporate popups. The app opens up safari and loads a sponsor's website without you pressing anything! Just scroll down the news on the app and it will load a popup and open safari. Very annoying, I will stick to the Reuters app for news."

2266,Clueless message mike,"February 2, 2011",3,Svp PUSH MESSAGES!!!!!!!!!!!! The app would be SOOOOOO much better if messages were pushed thru like text messages or alerts that other apps provide. Unless you are in the app the meesgaes never update. Fix that problem and the blackberry will become obsolete on Wall St
2267,bberinn,"March 8, 2017",1,"Rubbish After using this app for more than 2 years, it's time to finally delete it from my phone. Bloomberg like this app has lost focus of its strategic differential. One no longer knows what this app and the company stand for. For years, I've seen this app and the company introducing myriad changes that are poorly executed. RIP Bloomberg."
2268,Gaboruiseco7,"March 31, 2017",1,Really bad new update The last version of this app was Way Better!! It had more subcategories to search for media. In addition you can't no longer hear or watch live Bloomberg stream without closing your screen or reading other articles. Go back to the older version please!
2269,Momento Anima,"June 23, 2017",2,Good but many problems Great news stories but I won't be using it anymore since my stocks outgrew the watchlist limit. I'd gladly pay a fee for a version that gave me an unlimited watchlist. I can't afford the Bloomberg terminal I'm sure since there aren't any prices given for it.

2276,David948,"February 4, 2017",1,Still not working They put through a quick update in order to wipe out the hundreds of one-star reviews they got on the previous version. 
2277,Scottyjmp3,"February 22, 2017",1,"Seriously, Bloomberg? This app is horrible. The last one was perfect and was the best finance app in the App Store. This app's is visually appalling: the white colors are plain, the buttons don't take up the full screen and there is a lot of unused space. There is not as much information on this vs the last version. Please bring back the old app, Bloomberg!"
2278,Bobx1,"February 26, 2017",1,"New App S***s -- bring back the old one...! This version seems to have a lot less investible information, and an overdose of political and social crapola...

2302,TicoJester,"April 9, 2012",3,"Contractual obligations? Part of the reason why I dled the app was to see the Industry Movers chart in the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices, but these are contractually prohibited..

2316,Air kevin,"March 18, 2009",3,"Missing stocks Good app but many preferred stocks such as RBS T and N and Citi R don't seem to be accessable.

2317,Matt M Judge,"June 23, 2009",3,"Horrible You're lucky if you get it to update in less than 15 minutes, which makes this completely unusable.  Wifi, 3g, or Edge doesn't seem to matter."

2323,1990ZR1,"December 14, 2016",1,Useless I have never written a review on any app before but this update has made the watchlist section totally useless. I don't mind the ads because I understand your need for revenue stream but if I can't get detailed info about my individual positions I won't see those advertisers anyway. Think about that!!
2324,Career Investor,"December 14, 2016",1,"Worst app revision I have ever seen... This is literally the worst app revision I have ever seen. I am not at all resistant to online change, but this site has gone from an easily navigable, concise platform to a useless melange of confusing wandering. "

2326,newportsingapore,"December 18, 2016",1,Bring back the previous app The recent update is obviously a terrible mistake as noted in nearly universal bad reviews. Please just allow us to revert to the previous version.  This user (loyal since the very first version) will be leaving the site soon unless the splendid app we had until recently is revived!

2612,Wil9,"March 30, 2009",4,Great App. Love this app it is a great way to keep track of the stocks you like. It is also useful to research potential new ones. Can't beat the price either.
2613,javrun,"March 16, 2012",4,update won't open The new update will not open.  Keeps crashing.  It was
2614,John Gedney,"March 20, 2012",1,"Garbaggio I deleted the app and tried to re-install. Now I got nuttin, which is pretty much what I had before I deleted it and tried to re-install. Used to work great. Sad that Bloomberg can't get this to work properly. Isn't this what they do for a living? All that aside I would still vote for Mike if he took a run at the White House."
2615,mz3coupe,"June 8, 2012",2,"Updates Not timely The last update appears to have damaged or at the very least created numerous issues with this app. It WAS my go to app for business / financial news... Please fix, as this is no longer worth using."
2616,briantpar,"December 18, 2012",1,"Neglected app, hasn't updated in a year, move on... Bloomberg has updated their subscriber app but NOT this free one, this one crashes a lot and won't take up the whole screen, I suggest going to CNBC or another stocks app, not much functionality in this app either. Don't expect them to update this app any time soon..."
2617,Werdav266,"May 10, 2013",1,"Terrible app. Stock prices are never accurate to real time Think your stock is up 5%? Wrong! The app is just hours behind the market yet the app gives the present time as last updates. Get the etrade app, even if you don't have an etrade account at least the stocks are updated in real time."
2618,John Peepa,"October 4, 2013",5,The new updated app is great. What an update. The new app will be well received. It's light years over the earlier version. Great designers. John

2630,MJBlackwood,"December 15, 2016",1,Terrible App after latest update!!! I used to love this app until the latest update. Listened and watched radio and tv daily. Now the app doesn't run radio in the background and the new navigation is absolutely terrible.  I won't use it any longer until they fix.
2631,Tomatocruze,"December 15, 2016",1,Less information more blank space The latest update lets me see less information on my watch lists No control what you see.  The Yahoo finance app is now my go to for daily information on my watch lists.  Bloomberg go back to the old version
2632,Dolce Laverne,"December 17, 2016",1,"New Upgrade is a Downgrade I used to listen to this app daily in the phone background. Now, every time my phone automatically locks, which it does after 60 seconds, the app turns off. Completely awful! Do not upgrade if you have not done so already."
2633,BloombergYouFailed,"December 17, 2016",1,What a disaster You destroyed the app with the latest update. Whoever is responsible for this... you should look for a new job. Seriously. I'm sure you'll have some sort of skills.... but please don't do anything with computers involved.
2634,Hermanoneeye,"December 18, 2016",1,Why did you destroy the App? The latest upgrade is horrible!  It's like you went back to the first generation of iOS.  What were you thinking?  I think I am going to delete this because you deleted all the cool features that existed in prior versions.  
2635,RDmpls,"December 22, 2016",1,Bad update This used to be a great app.  I had multiple watch lists setup and could view lots of data including the 52 week hi/low and 1 yr return data.  Now it just shows current price and change for 1 day...  Also the chart and comparison tool doesn't work well.
2636,Jcsacto,"December 31, 2016",1,Make the alert go to the article!!! I love the stories but it's so annoying that when I get an alert about and article that I'm interested in the alert doesn't take me to the article!  Just a bunch of other stuff I have no interest in and can. Ever find the actual story I want!

2638,Elle0704,"February 1, 2017",1,Awful update. I want the previous app back! This update is awful. It offers a lot less news feeds and financial market updates. The user interface is significantly unfriendly. The only reason I am giving it one star is because I could not rate it as 0 star.
2639,Patricknewyork,"August 8, 2017",3,"Increasing font size not possible While the app is relatively robust, it is no longer possible to increase the font size of articles. Disappointing."

2660,LakeSherwood AV Fan,"October 27, 2013",1,"New version is too cluttered... Old version was simple ""listing"" of news titles that made it easy to search, filter through and read the articles that were of interest. New version uses too much real estate to pictures that don't always relate to the stories."
2661,Davelad,"November 1, 2013",2,"Too much video Seems they want to deliver EVERY story with ""exclusive"" video rather putting the news first. No longer is there breaking news; you have to wait for the video version. Very Disappointing on that front."
2662,MVK_137,"November 12, 2013",2,"Inferior version I used to love Bloomberg app - but recent update has destroyed its best features - customizable tabs, easy to read fonts, well organized market data. Now everything is cluttered. Wonder if I can revert to the previous version."

Really, it was a great app to begin with and they literally went through and either did away with or irreparably altered all the best features.

And now the watchlist can't be upgraded, the save edit button doesn't work, just in general a bad app. How can a rich company like Bloomberg make such a failure app?"
2687,Magilla57,"February 7, 2017",1,"Disastrous changes I used to always love this app and went blindly by it. Since it changed a few months ago, it is the worse app I have seen and I am going to delete it from my devices. What a pity. How can you allow someone to redesign an app and make it so much worse??"
2688,Weho caps,"February 8, 2017",1,"Awful update The new version is awful. The interface is terrible, it does not save changes to your watch list and does not display what you want to see. Whoever thought this was better needs to be shown the door. Time to move on."

2693,Fede (Buenos Aires),"January 24, 2015",1,Annoying Pop Ups (Huawei ads) I loved Bloomberg app but after the new update the experience is very painful due to the constant ad pop ups that appear every time you go to a new screen or page inside the app.

2698,Dudeski-J,"December 16, 2016",1,Horrible and Ugly Beyond Comprehension I was shocked Bloomberg changed their app to the unreadable monsters of ugliness.

2749,ASARATX,"July 3, 2017",1,White background is annoying The old version of this app used white text on a black background. The new version uses a white background which creates much more glare. At the very least give us the option to keep the old black background.

2804,Jumpimg,"January 30, 2017",1,Ruined a great App! New watchlist format is terrible! Bring back the old version! Can't track holdings any longer as before.

2805,JRLIII,"February 14, 2017",1,Primarily Anti Trump News Bloomberg has turned into a full assault anti Trump campaign. It's so left leaning that even someone who is more in the middle such as myself doesn't appreciate inaccurate facts and reporting. Bring back the old version and bring different news stories from all points of views.
2806,jakelly77,"February 28, 2017",1,"Why go backwards??! This version has removed core features I used daily - namely, why can't the app stream to chromecast or similar devices?   If Bloomberg does not want to be distribution-channel agnostic, it raises concern on how skewed the content is as well ... Only following the high dollar channels suggests there are dollars influencing the content."
2807,Hoff907,"April 3, 2017",1,"Don't waste your time Latest updates ruined the app, I was using it a dozen times a day, the new version is clumsy, pushy, and does not have the market information of the old.  Add the fact that the news is becoming so biased and the app becomes all but worthless"

2894,Geargoat,"February 26, 2009",5,"Information on the go Great app. Time saver, no longer watching bloomberg before bed with this app."

2904,waltonkeys,"December 15, 2016",1,"The Dec 2016 Update is a huge step backwards The latest update removes the market snapshot that used to be at the top of the home page.  You can't get a view of equities, bonds, futures and currencies on one screen anymore.  What in the world were they thinking with this update?"
2905,Sjow1968,"December 19, 2016",1,An awful app update - Fire the App Designer The latest Bloomberg App update is an insult to any user who used the old app on regular basis. Bloomberg should fire the App designer and the person who approved this version immediately and bring back the old version. It's a disaster. One star because '0' stars cannot be awarded.
2906,Dugggg,"December 19, 2016",1,What a disappointment I have little to add beyond what everyone else says. Why do away with everything the customer likes? Don't you do any testing or focus groups. Could have been avoided...
2907,Quadz2011,"January 16, 2017",1,"New upgrade is terrible! I'm a long time Bloomberg user. I also use large print on my iPhone. That's totally incompatible with newest upgrade.

2915,Benkner,"January 22, 2015",1,Old version was much better You used to be able open the app in the category you wanted. Now it automatically takes you to their home page. Too much navigation for content I don't care for.
2916,Parent2!,"February 13, 2015",4,Great for Commodities Would change to 5 stars if I could make charts over 30 years or max like Yahoo Finance
2917,Kin Fai,"February 15, 2015",1,"The App is Terrible How can a big name have such a bad app.  The display goes half page for no reason.  The changes in how to get to a page changes every few versions.  The ad, once you click you cannot get back into the app."
2918,TBill NY,"December 14, 2016",1,"Hideous Prior version was rock solid.  This version is awful. And I usually like a fresh new look. This view is terrible, especially in the watch list. And who wants to see a huge ad right in the middle.  "
2919,Pelindaba,"December 14, 2016",1,"Bloomberg Diappoints Just awful. Used to use it all the time quick, easy and simple. Now it's filled with advertising and less information.

2922,Pacifc007,"January 4, 2014",3,"Great app- but can be better This is probably the best financial news app out there. But there is too much clutter, and it could be better if it can import the investment portfolios from Fidelity, etrade, etc."

2949,dd8865,"August 10, 2017",1,Bugs App is buggy and not a good representation of Bloomberg online. Furthermore notifications only show biased news stories. I thought Bloomberg was finance and market focused. Not interested in getting notifications about negative politics. More market focused would be better.

2952,Steven Rhodes,"December 16, 2016",1,Off the scale terrible update Goodbye great app I used almost hourly during the day; hello slick trash whose main ingredient is white space. Did you get hacked? Someone replaced your wonderful goto product with a near useless piece of fluff.
2953,Kat-er-wahl,"December 16, 2016",1,"A Lost Favorite! Loved your app until this update. Gone is the black background which made text legible.

Sorry, Bloomberg your update is useless for me!"

2955,Snappyappdiver,"December 27, 2016",1,"Annihilated I used this app every day prior to this abomination of an update.  This is a perfect example of an abject failure of UX/UI (user experience/user interface).  Cartoon like and cumbersome with a distractingly annoying layout and font selections, it should be completely scrapped.  Absolute garbage.  Shocking that it was actually released."
2956,atlbrent,"December 28, 2016",1,Bad design and layout in 4.x This new app is a total miss on usability and layout. Tons of features now missing. No more easy black background either. Rethink this one and maybe try to pull back the good from previous versions. Tons of complaints on this.
2957,Newton 2369,"January 31, 2017",1,Useless Forced to 'upgrade'. New version is not suited for use on iPad Pro. It just displays one narrow column. Because they have replaced such a good app the only reasonable conclusion is that Bloomberg is getting out of the mobile business. They just did for me. Don't waste your time with this junk.
2958,joelob,"June 24, 2017",1,Poor upgrade The layout is colorful but the functionality is clumsy. 
2959,Bonanzabucks,"July 4, 2017",1,"Crashes After Opening Story Crashes as soon as I open it. This app has had serious stability issues during the last few updates. Surely, Bloomberg can do a better job or get better developers."

2964,dook3,"November 15, 2014",2,Too many ads and meh design They increased the quantity and obnoxiousness of ads to the point of silliness. I will uninstall because of it.  Scrolling a story accidentally opens redirect links way too often.   Design is also not great and comment posters are morons.
2965,Kegsandhookers,"January 6, 2015",1,"Most recent update is bad The newest update is awful, the predecessor was much easier to navigate, and switch between news and markets.  The side menu is a horrible idea, and needs to be rethought or brought back to the older version."
2966,deltapapa,"February 3, 2015",2,Last version This latest version is a little... Too much chaotic. It is always a battle ground when I need to find my  market list. I don't like it. The prior version was better.
2967,saturnino3,"February 5, 2015",1,"Atrocious redesign The recent redesign makes the app cluttered and difficult to read. Before, you could sort your preferred news categories. Now, the redesign in headline layout show screenshots for some which cram the text, making the stories feel cramped."

2977,kwd63122,"June 22, 2014",3,Good news bad news The good news is there is a great deal of good content and data. The bad news is the liberal slant of the articles. Mayor Bloomberg does after all own this thing.

3008,Xrmek,"March 19, 2012",1,Crashes every time Latest version is useless. I refuse to delete and reinstall because I will lose all the data input into the stocks part of the app. It would take 30+ minutes to re-enter it all. Looking forward to a fix.

3018,Bigbopper2,"January 31, 2017",1,Bring back the article listening capability This was an awesome app until they dropped the reading function. It was perfect for people on the go who wanted to listen to specific articles. Now we're forced to listen to all-too-general Bloomberg radio and daybreak.
3019,Het Niewsblad,"February 11, 2017",2,"Now looks like a tabloid I'm not a big fan of the new, cheap look. There's still lots of information in there; you now have to dig for it. Odd how someone thought this new version was an improvement."

I've been using this app for 3-4 yrs now and this update is the worst it could happen to the app. Navigation is horrendous - added a few counterintuitive taps in order to access some sections... Unnecessary for a too that was already perfect. Please bring the old setup back.
3024,Mny349,"September 17, 2015",1,"Full screen pop ups are a great addition Pathetic. There is nothing more annoying than a full page pop up ad on mobile. Next time your terminal sales people call me, which is monthly, I'm going to tell them that they've lost my trust."
3025,Larryboyboy,"May 13, 2016",1,Pop up ads every two seconds plus ads in content This app is awful. I love the content of Bloomberg but the frequency of these annoying ads makes it hard to read and so aggravating I prefer to read Bloomberg on my PC.

3028,Kpop1145,"December 15, 2016",1,Text size Works fine if your a 20 year old. But if you need larger text size it is not built responsive. Programmers fix this. Try it with the iPhone text size on the smallest level and it looks nice. Try it with a larger text and it becomes jumbled.
3029,Tiscoj,"December 19, 2016",1,"Latest release is awful They took a good app and made it terrible. Their used to be lots of info crowded on one screen. You choose what to look at, now you have to scroll down list if things in hopes of finding something."

3094,Former Bberg user,"December 27, 2016",1,Bloomberg: What Happened? Just downloaded latest Bbrg app. What a disappointment and not what I would have expected from a top tier firm such as Bloomberg.

3096,Rob Lancefield,"February 1, 2017",1,"Zero stars The new version is a quantum step down: from a well laid-out, rich trove of information to a sprinkling of vanishingly minimal information in a design where a non-content-driven love of whitespace has crippled user experience. Please bring back the old design. Until then, goodbye."

3217,Calc2,"January 26, 2017",1,What idiot decided this layout. Can you publish the names of who redesigned your app so we can all know who the industry worst is? This is garbage. Two margins of white wider than the centered text field. No way to increase text size. This app is the best example of poor decisions in the entirety of the App Store.
3218,Martinnole,"February 19, 2017",1,"Best to Worst Why would Bloomberg make a complete revamp of this app which was the BEST and now the WORST.

3226,markets user,"March 13, 2015",1,"Used to be so much better This app was so much better before they made Bloomberg Business. The content quality has gone dramatically downhill for those of us actually looking for cutting markets and financial news. No better than CNBC, fox biz, etc now"

CNBC is not as good as the old Bloomberg app, but after 99% negative reviews and users begging Bloomberg to undo their mistake it looks like it is not happening."
3330,Mark1029837465,"December 19, 2016",1,Bloomberg for ipad I am feeling at a loss for words at the epic failure in judgement by a great company like Bloomberg. I count on the old version to slice and dice the information to make investment decisions. This now feels like it's dumbed down for a grad schooler. Really? This forced upgrade is awful. I am looking for a new app. Any suggests fellow reviewer?

3938,Ccjsy,"March 5, 2017",1,Horrible Update.  Garbage Listen to your customers.  Go back in time and push the old app which worked fine.  The new version is horrible.  Its like you let a toddler update your app.

In April, BW forced me to give up the digital app (BW) for this bloated B, which is an overstuffed website masquerading as an app. If you want to read the magazine—which is all I want to do—you have to wade thru endless content. In theory you can download the magazine. But each article has to load so moving through the magazine is p a i n f u l l. This is a trial subscription free for 6 months. For free, it is almost not worth it. For the monthly cost thereafter, it doesn’t come close. In short, don’t waste your money."

6398,Castano del Rocha Grande,"December 7, 2018",2,"Review of Bloomberg News Although a significant number of articles are informative, there are by far too many articles with just a negative slanted biased opinion of Trump and conservatives in general that are based on a headline of partial truth and somewhat fit in the “Fake News” category. Prospective readers are more informed and educated than apparently they are given credit for. Trump, even with his faults, is attempting to run the government like a business should be ran and is a long overdue approach. A wealthy man like Mr. Bloomberg would never allow such waste in his business as is common in the bureaucratic public sector and would not keep employees or guest writers that spread such ill conceived partial truths about his own organization. Everyone needs to be part of the solution instead of promoting problems that do not exist. "
6399,dasow,"December 13, 2018",2,"EXCESSIVE DATA USAGE The Bloomberg app consumes too much data on Roku, Chromecast, Firestick, android, IOS, etc. You can't drop video playback quality from 1080p HD to lower 480p SD so daily viewing is limited. Otherwise you will easily max 1TB of data and incur extra charges on internet. Very bad in a household of 2+ people streaming. An update to fix this will really help."

6401,vso212,"March 9, 2011",5,"This App is Free the other review is incorrect I am writting to clear up a previous review, market data and news are free.  If the app asks you for a ""bunit"" code you can disable it by going to your iphone settings and disable ""Bloomberg"" anywhere.  If you pay for Bloomberg's professional service you can get your email and IM through this app but this setting needs to be enabled and you have to login."
6402,Ari Live,"October 30, 2017",1,"Fake news for click bate Happens all the time now, fake news, and now I can't take Bloomberg seriously since the campaign. Case in point, ios banner pops up: ""Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is EXPECTED to be CHARGED in investigation..."" I didn't want banners. They defaulted to a banner running in the background. It's spammy and not what Jobs envisioned. "

6405,mavertone,"February 1, 2018",1,Biased and fake Bloomberg does not tell the truth. They ate the president so much that they fly and put out fake news the only thing I take out with them is the futures. I look at the futures at around 2 to 4 in the morning. They could be a good news and business of look but it’s all fake. Topics like global warming climateRuined from ruined from disaster country in the last year change will chilling. I just put up falls and falls and falls narratives. They might as will be run by the communist party because they put up such drivel and lies and.The Bloomberg editors and Bloomberg himself can’t get over how Trump won the presidency. The true American public saved this country from disaster! God bless America and God bless the President!

6407,Nickname€#¥?+!,"May 11, 2018",1,"$35/month for ad filled articles I’ve used this app for a few years and before today it was my go to app for finance light reading on mobile, but I’ve immediately deleted it now that you have the audacity to charge $35/month for the privilege to weed through 3-4 ads per article to read 250-500 words. This is a bad joke, I’ll take my traffic elsewhere."
6408,TowelieBan,"May 12, 2018",1,34.99 subscription is offensive 10 free articles per month. 
6409,DanJoeDanGer,"May 15, 2018",2,"Not worth it - not even close. Maybe $7/month but $34.99??? It’s good and all, but why on earth would they think a subscription is worth almost as much as what I pay for Netflix + HBO + Hulu added together? Deleted..."
