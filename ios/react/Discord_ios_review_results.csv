0,rrosieposie,"June 10, 2019",4,"New display on lock screen So discord has been pretty much great overall, I love using it every day and never really had any problems with how it looked or worked, until this recent update. Now, while during a call, when I lock my phone on my iPhone, discord shows up as a call for everyone to see and access, like an iPhone call. I do not feel comfortable that anyone can just see that I’m on a discord call; that’s what I liked about discord. I could only access the call via the app, that’s why I used discord. If I wanted to access the call via the lock, I would’ve just called someone. Now discord is acting like an iOS phone call by making a new tab appear which is also annoying and difficult to just look at and manage with other apps that are opened. There was no original issue with how discord calls were displayed, now they’re blatantly out in the open for people to see and I believe it’s not convenient at all. It also bugs out when I just try to lock my phone sometimes. It won’t actually lock and when I tap my phone, the call will appear with the new look and my phone will be unlocked. I know you guys are trying something new but this is a bit of a stretch. Discord was discord by not looking like an iPhone/apple created application. At least make it an option to remove the display of the discord call on the lock screen, it would be greatly appreciated by those who desire some privacy."
1,SpareGuitar,"December 23, 2019",3,Integrated Phone Calls Discord is an amazing app that lets you do casual conversations without the loud notifications you would usually get from text messages. It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.
2,Cloud-Chan!☁️,"April 15, 2020",4,"Annoying Discord calls I love Discord, I have been using it for over 2 years now on both mobile and pc. Everything about Discord is great! It helps me keep in touch with friends and helps me make new ones! And the app is good quality itself! But there is only one issue I have. Every time someone calls me on Discord even if I have my notifications off, it goes through. I understand that you may want to be notified if someone calls you but the thing is it goes though as if it was a real phone call stopping me from what I was doing on my phone just to have a call notification block my screen. And the only way I have been able to fix the problem so that calls don't go through is putting my phone on Do Not Disturb but most of the time it blocks other important calls from family and people I know. If I don't answer or decline the Discord call the call goes to my call history which I don't enjoy. Even if I mute a group chat the call still goes through. What I'm saying is to make call notifications go through when we actually want them to and to make them stop invading to screen and to make them stop going through our call history. Im not sure if all of this is possible but if you could at least do one of those I would be delighted and give the app a full 5 stars, but for now its staying 4 stars. I hope you understand."
3,Grumpis D'Gringus,"May 7, 2019",3,"Please, please bring back the private call option Sure, Discord is much better in terms of quality, but by far my biggest complaint is the removal of the private mode option while calling people. I deserve a right to privacy, as does everyone else, and it’s too loud for that to be an option. Other people can hear my conversations and it’s very bothersome. I miss having the option between the two. Don’t fix something that isn’t broken please! Otherwise, there’s this constant bug with webcams/ turning on your camera. sometimes it never loads and you have to turn it off and on to get it to work properly. I’ve had to do this up to 3 times maximum to get it to work finally, which is nothing at first, but becomes annoying. Finally, (most likely not 100% discord’s fault, you can ignore this if you want) the connection seems to be getting worse. I used to love discord for the quality of the calls, but several times a week the quality becomes so bad that I have to restart the call several times to understand a sentence the recipient. The most common connection issue is definitely the that audio seems to skip out entirely for a few seconds sometimes. I understand that this could also be due to my own connection and the recipient’s connection, so take this with a grain of salt. Considering that, many times before there has been nothing wrong with our internet and this still happens."

5,Ghara.,"October 24, 2018",4,"Dear, Discord. Discord is a great tool for gaming, streaming, and almost anything you need out of a communication service/application. Yet it is lacking sometimes there is server lag or buggy happening on pc and the phone version usually just the phone version but its come along way and most of the bad issues are completely fixed. I just wish it was more compatible with certain devices, for example i don't have a great pc but it is good enough to play arma 2 - 3 with 60 frames yet discord likes to kill my cpu time usually freezes and such as well, despite playing with the prioity setting it higher or lower doesn't fix the problem. Ios version seems fine most of the time but sometimes has server lag or disconnects. But all in all its one of the best alternatives to paid communication services for gaming and streaming, and i am if it wasn't free it would be the best of paid applications, its simple you can create free servers and manage those servers with ease. btw in your update log you wrote ""with relative easy"" instead of relative ease. The best part i would say is how easy and how quickly you can create and connect with people so you can just get into your game and start playing. Thank you discord! i hope you continue to improve and fix this application, its been a few years since i have even looked at teamspeak and its all thanks to you guys|~<3"
6,Fat in the Hat,"April 14, 2020",3,"The ups and downs of mobile discord Before berating it, I’m going to give the team a thumbs up, since they created an app that essentially beats all other social media’s in its versatility and usage. It’s an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. "
7,Gorogokvi,"November 8, 2017",2,"Keeps crashing and marking unread messages as read. I like Discord for what it offers, but the iOS app crashes randomly whenever I try to load a picture, gif, song, or other upload someone else posted, and crashes when I try to post pictures quite frequently. I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. "
8,the game master : ),"April 12, 2020",5,"New additions that I want. I love love love this app, it is very useful and I use it all the time but there is this special feature called “Custom Status” which you can only make one custom status sadly. I wish you can make way more of them or probably a limit higher than 1. But other than that it is a really good app and hope you will have a great time with this amazing app! Also another problem is that for some weird reason now it started to lock me out of the app and it doesn’t let me get on it. It keeps getting me out of the app. Also can you make it so you can change the profile of somebody in your group, kinda like the nickname, and make it so you can have banned letters/words and an only this word/letter must be used in the text channel. It would make it easier when you have multiple bots with different prefixes like the rythm bot that lets you listen to music, you can make a rythm only text channel that allows you to only say the “!” prefix. And can you also make a customizable background, if it is too much to ask for a background then you don’t have to do that but please add the other features. Thank you so much for reading my note! Hopefully you read it all. From: The0neAndOnlyNoob#4598 :)"
