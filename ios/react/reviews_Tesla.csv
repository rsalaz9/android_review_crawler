0,Krahnin,"September 26, 2019",2,"Good App, Few Suggestions Update: Dropping this to two stars. All of the below still stands true. I have the lovely added benefit that whenever my car goes to sleep, the widget used to display “asleep”. Now it displays an error icon and says “please open app”. This has been an ongoing issue now for months."
1,s_b_3,"November 5, 2019",2,"Lousy solar app This is a review of the solar energy tracking part of this app. I don’t own a Tesla car. The app works, so I have to give it more than one star, but that’s about it. It has three major problems. First, while it has options for showing energy data on a year, month, week, or day period, when you select one of those options it brings you to the current day, week, etc. If you want to see data from 2 weeks ago, you have to view the current week, then hit the back arrow to go to the previous week, wait for it to get and display the data, and then hit the back arrow again. Repeat as necessary. Suppose I want to see the data for the summer equinox 2 years ago, I repeat these steps some 700 times?! "
2,Model 3 Mike,"February 23, 2019",5,"Great app, keeps getting better Tesla keeps improving my driving and car management experience regularly, through this app. Being able to adjust and readjust the climate remotely from my phone, including individual seat heaters, defrost, cabin temp, has been great this winter. Being able to remotely open the two trunks and charging port, flash lights and horn, etc., is nice to have when you want it. Being able to schedule a service appt, control the charging sched, map out nearest superchargers, and find pretty precisely where my car is at the exact moment, is really convenient. Only issue is the time it takes to “wake up” (connect from the app to the car), while it is only less than a minute, takes longer than I would like. When I’m standing in my house next to the router and the car is 20 feet away, also on the router, I would think it would be almost instantaneous. Would really, really like to be able to remotely activate any/all cameras and see the view from my phone. Thanks, Tesla!"
3,zephry0222,"October 9, 2019",1,"They took away the solar city app You took away a functioning app that provided us with useful tools to monitor our solar systems installed in 2 homes.  Also had the ability to make payments.  You forced us on to this app where only one home can be monitored, to a very limited degree.  Can’t make payments.  Can’t get assistance.  Forced into a website, that still gives no detailed information on the system in order to make a payment.  Why would you take away a great tool and replace with something that is of no benefit.  If you haven’t noticed, the world runs on apps."
4,Tech_hed,"September 30, 2018",5,"I don’t have any problems that these others are My experience has been great with no occurrences of issues that others leaving bad reviews mention. I think it is very device and location specific, meaning phone make/model, cell tower connectivity between phone and vehicle, WiFi/internet service (if involved in the connection equation), and potentially needing to reset the mobile phone altogether. Specifically, I have never had username/password/logout issues, so it can’t be the app is poor or my experience would be consistent with theirs."
5,Two year owner,"November 26, 2018",1,"Worse after v9 When I plug in the car to charge I no longer get a message saying charging scheduled for 11 PM or whatever time you set up for.  it just says charging stopped. Therefore when I go to sleep I have no way of verifying that my charge is set and ready to go like i used to.  Also, I no longer get an error message that the cord is plugged in incorrectly or there is a fault or whatever might impede my charge that is going to start a couple of hours after I go to sleep. The old app gave that info which you could check at a glance before retiring for the night. This is quite a downgrade from your previous version which gave all of that information and more. If you’re going to start annoying people with updates that take away actually useful features in the real world, you’re just like every other tech company. Now just to be sure I don’t wake up in the morning without a church I have to manually start my charger at about 10 PM before I go to bed confirm that it’s charging correctly and then go to sleep charging when electricity still very expensive rather than starting later in the middle of the night. Thanks Tesla."
6,DocStitz,"September 9, 2018",3,"Heavy background activity and battery use even with “Background App Refresh” off I’m a new Model 3 owner, and have been using this app for a 8 days. I like the convenience of the effortless lock/unlock functionality the Phone Key option offers. The ability to control so many of the car’s features remotely is great too. But something seems a bit off with this app’s background activity."
7,WALL-E3000,"May 7, 2019",5,"Sentry Mode Request Sadly, our Model 3 got backed into while parked overnight, and unfortunately, that was the one night we forgot to activate Sentry Mode. Fortunately, the other driver left a note but that could have easily resulted in a hit and run with no info on the driver."
8,NCJohn,"January 4, 2019",3,"Phone-as-key needs more flexibility As a I write this, key fobs are sold out. They are a bandaid fix to this issue anyway that I am guessing can be fixed with software. "
9,afgoody,"February 7, 2019",3,"Good not Great I like the app, but there is room for improvement:"
10,rich1383,"March 8, 2018",2,"No notifications! I’ve had the Powerwall 2 since it came out. [We have no solar as we live in a condo.] However, as a back up for the frequent power outages we have in the Northeast, it has been great. Fallback to battery is silent, seamless, and usually not even noticeable.  But that’s my big complaint: there is no text message or notice of any kind from the app notifying you of the fact it is running on backup power. Yesterday, we ran on the PW for 3 1/2 hours and I never knew it!  In previous outages it was the power company text notification that let me know the power was off in our area.  Hence the two star rating for now (and because it is so easy to fix!).  Tesla: PLEASE fix this simple issue! We need to know if we should be conserving power, such as not running the dryer or a/c.  For solar owners it may need to work differently, but just make it an option."
11,asegar,"March 23, 2018",2,"No indication that we’re running on backup power! When I purchased our Powerwall I specifically asked whether there was a way to be informed when our utility power failed and we were running off the Powerwall. I was told the app could be set up to send a text message/email when utility power was interrupted. Now our Powerwall is installed, I discover that this alert system has been removed “because there were problems with it”."
12,acasasola,"April 28, 2018",2,"App shows Phone Key Disconnected This is a constant issue that I’ve been experiencing.  In fact, I took Delivery of my Model 3 on April 24, 2018 and while doing so they couldn’t get my phone to work with the car.  They told me that I may have to drive my car and it will, at some point, begin working.  This is far from the truth.  The issue is that the app at some point drops communication with the car.  If I understand correctly this communication is done by Bluetooth.  The only way the app is able to reestablish connection with the car is by rebooting your iPhone.  Taking this action has worked consistently.  This option, while some may think is easy, is not a good a good option.  For one thing, if you have an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus, restarting the iPhone takes a few steps.  You have to hit Volume Up, Volume Down, Press and Hold Sleep/Wake button.  Please fix this!"
13,WJZA,"November 2, 2018",5,PowerWall2 + 9.0 Model S Update Update!!! The Tesla team has done it again!!! They had tweaked the recent update and now I have Zero complains!! AWESOMENESS!!! 
14,<krs13>,"February 13, 2019",4,Good app but there can be improvements Like the app overall but there are 2 things I think the developers so consider;  1) Adding  a button in the climate control to shut off heated seats.  I have read it is possible to shut it down but holding onto 1 of the seats for a few seconds but so far I have not been able to get this to work.  I don’t use heated seats at all and to shut each individual one off every time in the app is cumbersome.   2) Setting charge time in the app.  This would be a nice feature as I change my battery limit and time almost daily.  I find myself walking to my car too often just to confirm I would have the correct power level for the trip next day.  It would be much more convenient to be able to set both time and battery level in the app.
15,hdc1388,"March 23, 2019",5,"Love the app! In the world we live in today, who doesn’t love having the control of everything right at your finger tips? Love that I can use the app to control the garage door as well, it saves from having to install a wireless connection for it and use a different app for that feature, so it’s awesome that you can do that. What I would like to see is the option to add or remove the widgets on the main screen, right now it has the A/C, frunk, and locking widget. Being able to add the trunk as an option, or turn on sentry mode since it’s not a default, or the garage control, would be an awesome update. Also I want to be able to access the additional camera views, after all, I did just spend over 50k on the car, you’d think I be able to use fully what I purchased"
16,autnagrag,"May 15, 2019",3,"OK app, needs improvement I bought a new Tesla Model 3 three days ago. I connected it to 110 V power at my office, went into the building, and the app would not lock the car. I had valuable objects in the car. After 10 failed attempts to lock the car, the app told me the door was open. I went to the car and opened and firmly closed each door, went back into the building, and again could not lock the car over and over again. It turned out to have been the truck that was open. Unlike the doors, the trunk can present a perfectly plausible appearance of being closed without in fact being closed. Why mislead me by telling me that the door is open when it is not true? It is not such a complicated notion: if the app is refusing to perform an act it has been asked to perform, tell me why, the true reason why, not a false reason why."
17,suggrr,"November 15, 2019",1,"App will not heat or cool your car! DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PETS OR PASSENGERS IN THE CAR WITH THE “CLIMATE KEEPER” OR DOG MODE ON! I set my car to maintain a temperature of 60 degrees using the car’s touchscreen. When I was about ten minutes away from getting back into the car, I upped the temperature to 68 degrees and made sure the seat and steering wheel were heating up. When I got into the car, the interior was 66, according to the touchscreen, which indicates to me that the car might have been heating up to 68. The steering wheel and seat were ice cold, so they were not warming up. When I started to drive, the temperature was mysteriously set back to 60, as I had set it for climate keeper, not when I had most recently set it to 68 via the app. The car is not obeying what I set in the app, no matter when I try to preheat it, and hasn’t followed what I set in the app for heating (car, steering wheel, seat) since the past few software updates. Give me back the functionality I thought I was getting when I bought this car!"
18,Pixonti,"November 25, 2019",4,"Doesn’t work with iPadOS Despite the information here on the compatibility, this app does not work with my iPad. It would be nice to have an actual iPad app to use, just in case my -home is not available. I do use this app daily. Tesla keeps updating and adding new features. A few features would be nice to have, first the ability to set the level for charging from the app, not just the limit and ability to start and stop charging. Viewing the most recent air pressure for the car would be great as well, instead of having to show it by switching it on the display. Showing the percentage of charge as well as the rated or ideal miles would be helpful. I've thought of a lot of features that could easily be implemented in the app, but are not."
19,TryThisNicknameOnForSizeThisTime,"March 3, 2020",2,Basics but not much more CONS
20,tone Model X,"June 22, 2018",2,"App Issues??? For the last couple of days I’ve been using the App because my key fob is on back order on my Model X. The App itself has been acting weird lately, when I try and access the App the notification on it will either say CONNECTING or WAKING UP. I know for sure that it’s not my phone. I’ve deleted the App cleared my history, turned off my cellular connection, bluetooth, Wi-fi and deleted the App. I turned back on my phone on several different occasions and re installed the App several times. (“ I’ve tried accessing app on several different phones, just to make sure”). The App still says the same thing. WORST experience EVER. What if I was way out far somewhere and this happened??.. I’m glad I wasn’t that far from home or I would be in a real messed up situation. Idk what’s going on with the App or connection issue from the App to my Model X."
21,Patrickl27,"July 15, 2018",4,"Usually great! Sometimes can’t connect; needs Apple Watch app Most of the time the app works great! It feels so futuristic to just open the car, as it unlocks and wakes up automatically, detecting your phone. Occasionally, however, the app will get stuck on “waking up” for too long and need to be force quit to connect to the tesla. Thankfully, this is pretty rare. "
22,smittygal,"November 11, 2018",1,"Something Seriously Wrong With Solar App Note to Apple:  The ""app support"" link for this app takes users to SALES, not support. "
23,NAKID1,"February 27, 2019",3,"Overall good, but needs work My biggest pet peeve is the amount of times it takes the app to “wake up” the car. I have a Model 3 and it can range from immediate to “communications error” despite having a great signal with a clear view of the sky. "
24,"Roger,Roger.","September 2, 2019",1,"Miss solar city app My first complaint is that I had a lot of trouble signing into the app the first time and now that I’ve gotten a new phone I have to sign in again and it’s giving me even more headaches. It says my password is incorrect on the app but using the same password works fine on the website. Resetting my password did nothing to help.  My second complaint is in general about the app. Tesla is making their solar panel customers use the Tesla app and did away with the SolarCity app. It might look edgier and cooler but it’s annoying to use. I miss the SolarCity interface it gave all the information I needed in a cleaner, quicker and easier to understand way. Last it annoys me that they combine the solar functions with the car functions in the app because the rating makes it seem like everything is great but that may only apply to the car functions."
25,Duck in beaver town,"September 30, 2019",5,Love it! Edit: works great after V10 release. Love all the remote controls :) 
26,LostInParadice,"November 29, 2019",5,"Best Car App Ever. Screw these prissy people who rate 1 or 2 stars First of all, I was reading the 1 and 2 star comments and I concluded that you’re all idiots and prissy f@&ks. You want soo much stuff added to an app thats obviously free of charge. You deserve no sympathy. This app is awesome and it will evolve over time. Best phone app for a car that I’ve ever used and it keeps getting better and better. I never used BMW’s or any other luxury cars app, but I am very content with Tesla and the model 3. Everyone else who is posting about stupid stuff are annoying and should be thankful this is free to owners. You people make me sick reading your trash comments."
27,Slopez02,"September 3, 2019",2,"Terrible App for Solar Use Now that individuals that had the Solar City App have been forced to use the TESLA app to monitor solar production, we get far less information than before.  My total solar production for the day isn’t accurate and there’s no way to get further information to understand the information that IS provided. For instance: my app states I produced ..8KW of solar energy today, yesterday, the day before and the day before that.  When I place my finger over each hour of the day and add up the output for each hour, I can clearly see the total for the day far exceeds .8KW.  I better be getting the credit for the actual output!  This app doesn't compare well to the Solar City App we used before.  It’s also totally black and made to look sleek.  It’s not sleek when it’s pretty much useless."
28,philgreenc,"August 19, 2019",5,"Absolutely incredible app - just one request Amazing app. I’m loving everything about this car and the app. I’ve never had my expectations so high for sooo long, only to have them fulfilled and surpassed so greatly."
29,Suzblueyes,"July 23, 2019",1,Big downgrade from SolarCity app The SolarCity app was terrific. I could drill down any historical data to the day/month or year. I could compare my output from one year to the next. It was simple but elegant. 
30,Latris On Da Menjay!,"September 3, 2018",1,"App causing WiFi interference My iPhone 8 is the primary key to the Model 3 and ever since I got the car, I’ve experienced several server timeouts and long loading times. I deleted the app and everything on my phone started working normally again. This is is huge issue...having the app is a necessity for the car yet it destroys my ability to use the phone for anything else. Please send a fix that eliminates the interference!!"
31,SincereBrigand,"September 28, 2018",1,"The menu just doesn’t work So am waiting for my model 3 to be delivered. I can watch the instructional videos. If I close the window i get an empty screen and swiping right to reveal the menu results in the menu only opening 3/4 of the way. I can see my inbox has a message for me but the UI is unresponsive. It was the same with the previous version. This update didn’t fix the problem. You’d think the developer would have been mortified to have shipped out the previous version and have sent out a hotfix. However one version later and showstopper of an issue remains. I hope I’m happier once the car is delivered, but this is not helping my purchase anxiety, especially for such a big-ticket item. Are you farming the app development out Elon?  You might want to consider a new partner."
32,Paul1662829285,"December 17, 2018",5,"Only free & functional remote start app I don't have a Tesla but I just got done sifting through 16 other car manufacturer's apps looking for free remote start. Not only do most charge $10+ per month, but almost all have <2 stars and the ones that have decent ratings (Ford/Chevy) have a bunch of recent feedback that the app just doesn't work at all. Thank you Tesla just for providing a free app that's able to warm the car up remotely. Even something as simple as that is way ahead of other car companies."
33,Grandewhitemocasid,"April 12, 2019",5,"Updated App This is a great app. It tells me when the battery has completed charging. This is very helpful when using a SuperCharger to charge the car, and I leave to get coffee while it is charging. I have used the app to unlock and lock the car when I did not have the keys with me. Only problem I had is that I did an update to the app, and the app temporarily stopped working - I got a vehicle connection error. But the problem resolved itself within a couple of hours."
34,Pacificsky,"August 28, 2019",1,Tota failure Switching from Solar City app to Tesla was a total failure on Teslas part.     Not only can i no longer see anything on SolarCity but the new tesla app says i have an account but wont let me log in stating i have no associated products with the account.    Already disappointed in Tesla.    
35,Dbldimps,"August 26, 2019",2,"Solar Billing Information So nice of you to FINALLY address the complaints concerning the app’s inability to provide detailed solar usage over specific periods of time. Now how about adding billing information. In the old SolarCity app, in addition to being able to show my power usage, it allowed me to see my account and the amount that I was being billed for energy. For those of us who chose paperless and automatic billing, how do I get that information? I previously relied on the app. Can I access this information online? You should have at least provided information concerning what the new app would and would not provide in comparison to the old app and then gave us options on how to retrieve specific information.  DO BETTER GUYS!"
36,Coolguy0805,"August 3, 2019",1,"Horrible replacement for the My Solar City App! This app leaves a lot to be desired from the old My Solar City App. The company appears to be catering only to it's vehicle owners in many ways lately and this new app certainly follows suit! Almost all of the specific details that were able to be accessed in the old app are no longer available. I have 2 separate invertors and used to be able to see an exact breakdown of each individually by hour, day, week, month, and year but not anymore. After being forced to switch to the new Tesla App on August 1st 2019, it has certainly been a disappointment and I would describe it as generic at best. I hope Tesla will address this subpar app soon and make the appropriate changes without completely forgetting about their Residential Solar Customers!"

38,JACo_OLz™,"June 16, 2019",3,"Slow App keeps slowing down my Internet and won’t even load any data on my phone. And the tesla app also doesn’t update. Always have to quit from the background after waiting for 5-10mins. Tesla, can you please look into this? We need an update since 80-90% of the car depends on the app. It would also be nice to add an option to automatically detect the location if you are outside your garage and parked in public. The sentry mode will automatically enable. For example, work(street parking), Mall public parking, Restaurants(public street parking/private parking). This saves the cars safety if the driver forgot to enable the sentry mode in the app."
39,jitheshm,"October 22, 2019",4,Great app.. needs improvements I’ve been using this app for more than a year with my model 3 and it works great. Its a bit slow to load but works flawlessly. The new feature of smart summon and opening closing vent is very useful. Climate control is the most useful feature in my opinion especially in new england weather. It provides good monitoring and control features for Tesla apps. I’m not a big fan of sharing my credentials with unofficial apps so I’m only planning to use Tesla app for rest of my life. That being said I feel this official app needs some improvements too here is my wish list
40,Ing253,"October 29, 2017",3,"It does the basics, but a few additions would make it SO much better! I just got the version 3.0 update and was really disappointed. Beyond a pretty redesign, literally the only new function added was TouchID to turn the car on."

42,AppleSince86,"January 2, 2018",3,"Fix the damned password problem Do the people who develop this app have to use it? It doesn't seem so, because if they did they would have abundant incentive to fix the exasperating problem of having to re-enter the password over and over and over again throughout the year, as the app perpetually forgets that a password was established, or that Touch ID was activated. Half the time that I go to use the app when pressed for time, Touch ID is inactive in the app it demands that the password be re-entered, and Touch ID be reactivated (AGAIN having to enter the password). Can't Tesla get this simple function to work right?"
43,MrNewVersion,"February 23, 2019",3,"Mind of its own with Powerwall My Powerwall hardware has been reliable in the year since I’ve had it.  Unfortunately, this app won’t let me adjust them as I want to.  The customization controls are regarded as suggestions instead of instructions, and the charge/discharge times are somewhat unpredictable.  "
44,Larame,"December 21, 2019",4,"Greats app but where is my Apple Watch app?? App works great. I just need Tesla to add Apple Watch functionality, specifically the ability to use the watch as a stand-alone key for the car. There are so many instances which I would love to not have my phone on me while using the car; surfing, exercising, quick store run, forgot to grab something out of the car, etc. I don’t want the watch to do more than have the same Bluetooth functionality that my phone does. At least enable that while building a full functioning watch app. Please."

Based on what I can see and other reviews, it is clear that Tesla has put little thought and effort into the solar aspects of the app - no iPad version, no landscape view, reduced information about historic power generation. They must be just doing this to promote car sales, but the crappy app and the complete failure to respond to my request for customer service isn’t going to result in any sales to me and it sure as hell is not going to prompt me to recommend Tesla solar installations."

Right now, the app will not update and we must use our card key to open the doors and run the car.  This is a major problem as I (and many others) do not keep their card key with them - assuming the app key will work.

I noticed this issue when I first got my Model 3.  I thought it was an issue with my phone or router. I troubleshooted extensively with Apple and was not successful. I deleted the app and my wifi went back to normal.  As soon as I reinstall the app my wifi keeps getting interrupted intermittently.  I did this twice.  I am confident that the app is somehow interfering with the wifi connection.  Also, my Model 3 won’t detect my phone and l have to open the app to unlock my car."

When we wake up in the morning, the Tesla app doesn’t want to connect to our car at all. Upon checking to see if it was connected to our WiFi, I saw that it wasn’t. When entering the car, the signal bar has a line through it. It doesn’t make any sense. Sometimes the Tesla app works, sometimes it doesn’t.

The app lets me know there is an update, also provide the release notes for that update. It’s okay that they’re in the car but 100% of the time that I’m hopping in my car, I’m in a rush to go somewhere like to work. That is not the time to spend 15 minutes reading through whatever cool improvements Tesla has incorporated into my car. I’d like to be able to read through them at my leisure."
56,BrianArizona,"August 1, 2019",1,"Much degraded view of Solar production Tesla’s solar data reporting present only the very most basic information, compared to the SolarCity app. No longer can I see and compare past years production, view more than one month, or even see historical data past the last 12 months. There is now no temp data or cloud coverage data. I am unable to determine how my panels are actually performing over time. Perhaps this was done intentionally so that I cant see problems or underperformance. I’ve had to have two service calls in 5 years. The second time I never received a call from Tesla - I had to call. Seems like a big step down in transparency and customer service."
57,Tinyrosebud,"July 19, 2019",2,"Not very useful for solar customers I've been receiving reminders by Tesla to migrate from their Solar City branded apps and website to this app.  Well, this app doesn't provide as much historical data on solar generation.  There are views for today, yesterday past day, last 7 days, last 4 weeks and last 12 months.

It also happens on four separate cars, one of which isn’t even linked to my account. When I told them this, they just stopped responding. It’s not safe and not ok that they won’t respond and not fix it. This has happened through several car AND phone updates. Hopefully this review brings more light to this unsafe situation."

60,Farzyness,"December 24, 2017",4,"Good extension to car features that could do so much more This app does a great job of giving you a lot of basic functionality for the car, but it would be fantastic if it could a couple simple additional things, like setting a time of departure and the car automatically warm itself up, precondition the battery, and charge itself for optimal performance. Would also be great to set a schedule (ie Monday I leave by 7:15 AM) and have the car do its thing."
61,pw0523,"May 4, 2018",4,"Good app but still... Many of the features here are great but the app itself needs to have some work done. Mainly, the relentless entering of passwords has been over the top and recently even when putting in the right password and email the app has been locking me out and saying the login information is incorrect. I was able to enter the app without problem a week ago and it’s quite frustrating not being able to log in. Please fix this problem."
62,markieelop,"August 26, 2018",5,Great app! Works as intended and i have not had any issues with controlling and checking on my M3. It would be great to add a built-in Supercharger location / status function either under the “Charging” or “Location” sections. It would make planning a trip in advance or organizing your day a bit easier. Being able to see how many stalls are available just as it shows within my M3 display would be fantastic!
63,Sathsy,"October 21, 2018",5,Continuously improved This is an app for owners of Tesla. Unlike many other mobile apps you need to have one of the Tesla products to use it. In addition to the car software updates this app gets improved version on version. 
64,Graecus13,"May 31, 2019",4,Great app I agree with the prior rating. It is way better than my last vehicle. Few things that could be changed. Like the other user I use the trunk way more than the frunk. Adding that to the home screen and the widget would be very helpful. I haven’t charged at home yet so I can’t say to the charging statements made by the prior rated. Also. Apple Watch app support. I’d love to use my watch as the key. As my watch is always on my wrist. Even when my phone is not around. 
65,A new user2,"June 5, 2019",1,"The app drains battery like crazy The app functions well except it sometimes loses connection with the vehicle and requires you to reset the Bluetooth and the app to use it again as the key.  The major issue is it drains battery very fast.  From the  iPhone’s battery usage data, the app is constantly draining battery even during sleep hours.  I can see every hour from 12am to 7am it uses about 2-5% of battery.  Overnight it is the main contributor for the 20-30% battery loss I see in the morning.  "

Why did you let me schedule it then?? I clicked the selection in your menu! I had to call in, get transferred around multiple times like any other dealership, then get an appointment where I now need to drop the car off for 4+ hours.

We can’t sign in, we can’t use any functions of the app and we have been trying for 3 weeks to reach someone (anyone)through tesla support. The support chat seems to be broken as it never connects with anyone, and no one answers their support phone line. We have written 3 emails to them with zero response. We are incredibly frustrated that the app is broken and their customer service is non-existent to help remedy."

Not really sure why everyone gets to to beta test app. Totally inconvenient. Tesla needs a legit beta testing team and process. Now I have to go to service center and screw up their day coming at an inconvenient time. It will require me to go back again just to schedule a service double wasting my time.

At a minimum you should have some level of restricted access if a linked product is needed.  That way, a new comer like me can review the app well prior to my vehicle’s delivery date.

Tesla purchase the solar company that installed my system and replaced the online history with this app, which only shows summary detail after the current day.  I prefer using my desktop when not making calls but the Tesla website provides zero info except how to make payments online.  Take note Tesla, eliminating function and features is not how to generate goodwill and satisfied customers.  On the plus side, after paying my $115 monthly lease I do love the $8 monthly electric bills.  Way down from the $200/mo expense before solar."

87,jktj13,"December 18, 2019",1,Horrible replacement for the Solar City app The Tesla app might be good for car owners but it falls way short for Solar owners. You need to look at the old Solar City app and add back most of if not all of the features from that app. This gives such limited information it is useless.

Tesla will no longer support the Solar City app. This app is a real downgrade from the Solar City app. It doesn’t provide as much information (no lifetime production) and what it terms monthly production is really a four week mover.  This makes it much more difficult to track my production for SREC credits. In replacing the Solar City app, I would have expected the Tesla app to be at least as good if not better. Unfortunately, it’s a real disappointment."

227,JAOlson,"June 29, 2019",1,"Poor past information analysis on app I have been a SolarCity customer over 5 year but I am very disappointed in the transition to the TESLA app. The Tesla app does not give daily, monthly or yearly data on past months, year to date, full year production or lifetime production. The only “good” presentation is the daily in color graph. I like to use the “now” feature to see what my high consumption appliances are using and at what rate. PLEASE incorporate those details back into the Tesla app."
228,William Polkinghorn,"July 19, 2019",1,Huge Downgrade At the end of the month the SolarCity app is shutting down and being replaced with the Tesla App for monitoring home solar production.  I got the new app today and loaded it to the iPad.  It is very  disappointing and a major downgrade.  It is aa phone app and needs to scale to fit the iPad like software from five years ago.  I was expecting an upgrade with all of the functionality of the old software and the Tesla touch having leading edge technology.  This new app is worthless
229,kld818,"June 21, 2019",1,"Horrible switch from Solar City We are solar customers and have to switch to this app from the Solar City interface.  First, we can no longer access the data from a computer, required to download the app.  There is no real time feedback, no way to look at a point in time in the past, other than the predefined periods (yesterday, current month, current year).  Very disappointed with the change."

232,kopfff,"November 3, 2018",3,Charging start time is bogus Since a reported recent API update the charging start time no longer displays in the app. In the today widget it shows a bogus time that doesn’t match what the car is actually set to. Please fix that ASAP!

236,CruzzzzN,"April 17, 2020",1,"Solar; Stuck like Chuck! Oh my, this is the worst app ever.  So these people wanted to get into the solar business so they bought out solar city.  The problem is the app was primarily developed for its autos.  The bigger problem is the app works when it wants to on my end, and Tesla doesn’t care because it’s getting all the data it can from me because it works on their end, so I get this worthless app because it’s required?  What a ripoff piece of junk!"

255,Rmagallan10,"October 15, 2019",2,It’s good but it doesn’t meet standard. After using this app for about 2 months I’ve noticed that the time to fully load the app up is about 2-3 minutes which is way too long to launch an app. There needs to be an update on the app where it’s better at load time and overall interface to be better.

Incredibly painful and slow process to transfer.  That applies to the app because they tell you to sign up to use the app to monitor but it is impossible to get your account working.

328,piercecosmo,"September 12, 2019",1,"Can I have my SolarCity App back, please? The Tesla app is so much more poorly designed than the SolarCity app was. Half the screen is taken up by blank space and I have to scroll to see the full chart of how much power my panels have generated. It provides less information than the prior app and doesn’t give any indication of the current status. I love my solar panels, but this app is atrocious."
329,hakbeeb,"August 13, 2019",1,App is very inaccurate on solar production Apps shows your solar production and use way higher than what PGE actually says and charges you for. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy solar from Tesla or the power wall (canceled order after a 14 month wait) and I can’t speak for their vehicles as I canceled my model 3 order after being lied to during my solar and power wall experience.

So thanks for that."
343,soaringDude,"January 28, 2019",2,Very poor compared to solar city app! This might be a great app for Tesla cars but as a replacement for solar city app it is a very very poor substitute. It is missing most of the functions of the original app and is a lot less intuitive to use. The graphs are prettier though. I hope Tesla steps it up before getting rid of the old solar city app.
344,Awesomeness1771,"May 13, 2019",2,Not very useful I am using this app for the Tesla solar panels and this app compared to the solar city app they use before is not very good.

There is an intentional lack of customer service with Tesla. The service center here WILL NOT ANSWER. Leave a message, no response, leave 4 messages, nothing. So ok you buy a car, there are issues that stop you from being able to use the vehicle and your only means of solution is to schedule an appointment app for service. What if that’s 2 and half weeks later? Call customer service? There isn't one. Email Tesla? I did that, it’s been 2 days, no response. So then what are you buying when you buy a Tesla? A brand new peace of technology that is prone to have issues that you have 0 customer service with. Where I applaud Tesla for changing the world. I frown on them for getting something as simple as keeping happy customers so wrong. Again if you are thinking about buying a Tesla please know that they will try and charge for things you did not order or need, they will out right lie to your face about calls or emails, and you have access to an app and a calendar for customer service outside of when your vehicle is in service and that’s it. Tesla has forced all the other major car companies to change to electric, and due to the horrible customer service they give I would encourage to wait for the car company you know and love to come out with there own electric vehicle. At least that way you know if there is an issue you can pick up the phone email w.e. and solve the issue and not be sent down a rabbit whole chasing help that just isn’t there."

Initially, the app welcomes new owners with stylish graphics and a clearly organized layout. Then, as you (we) began to operate day to day, we encountered numerous highly problematic issues with the app and the Tesla experience in general. Most notably, needing to schedule vehicle maintenance. Tesla makes this process seemingly easy by allowing owners to make maintenance appointments through their app. But if the app is buggy and says something stupid like “missing address in your Tesla account” even though there is clearly one listed, then you can’t schedule maintenance easily and getting your car fixed is a major undertaking - leaving you swimming up creek without a paddle. Particularly, because Tesla also makes it near impossible to talk to a human beings over the phone. FYI, the reason I need vehicle maintenance is because my Bluetooth features suddenly stopped working on one of the two Tesla’s. And Tesla’s Bluetooth features are notoriously unreliable; simply look on any of the public forums to verify. But that’s another separate but related issue."

There would need to be an option that indicates activity only when fob is not present or even if fob is present.  For instance, I would like to enable to activity alert when I am not home and someone decides to take the car for an unapproved joy ride (kids) or so I can see when service is being performed on the car so I can tell when repairs have started.

782,"Folsom Superdad/""charger""","March 25, 2013",4,Tesla 1.1 update ... Good start First of let me say I've Waited a few years for the car so I don't mind a little wait for the app to improve. The fact there is an App we probably take for granted. The first version hit a home run  for me with charge status and real time updates on my wife's driving habits ☺ I expected more for a company that took its time to put out a quality electric car so this new small tease of an update is a little disappointing. New to electric I find myself using other apps to find charging stations away from home. I also have found that these stations come with a fee and sometimes even a special magnetic card is needed to activate. And the third thing which I can't believe hasn't been addressed setting timer or scheduled calendar or timed charging by Hour/min. Per day. Something really trick to be added would be to add radio function to the smart phone like a remote for my family to pass around so the driver can focus on the road. Window fully down and up would be a great addition since not everyone will have the panoramic roof. And raising or lowering the car for grandparents would be great as well as prepping to leave driveway. Eventually I'm sure these things will show up so in the meantime I'll just enjoy the gas savings and the wicked acceleration on my daily commuter.
783,**Freddy,"November 26, 2013",5,"Wonderful app, now made even better We have owned a Tesla Model S since mid-July 2013 and have found the Tesla app to be invaluable.  I used it to track the car's location while it was on the flatbed from the Service Center in Watertown MA until it was offloaded at our driveway in Southwest Harbor ME, and while it was on the car-carrier coming down here to Naples FL.  Great for satisfying my curiosity and impatience.  I use it daily to check on the progress of charging and the temperature in the car, as well as to show friends the location of the charging port and other features of the car.  I love the new improvements today, especially that it shows the real appearance of the car (e.g., no sunroof and correct color).  It also seems to wake the car a bit faster and lets me adjust the charge limit as if I were in the car."

It's now been almost 2 years and they can't figure out how to optimize this app for the iPhone 6 / 6 plus? One of the only apps left on my phone that hasn't done so. While the features it has are useful, it's lacking tons of features that would be nice. How about access to cold weather package options? Apple Watch support? Scheduling? Ability to start an update remotely? It's almost as if they forgot they have an app. They do occasionally add features that aren't particularly useful and no one asks for, so they must know they have an app. Do they just not care? Spite? I can't figure it out. "
786,CD1928,"December 29, 2016",5,"Excellent app, great functionality. I have a BMW i3 and a Model X. One of the biggest headaches with my i3 is the BMWi remote app. BMW's app frequently gets stuck, reporting information that is hours, and sometimes several days old. Tesla's app always give accurate information, consistent with the information on the infotainment screen. It even gives you the address where it's parked in writing, as opposed to just a pin on a map. It does have a hard time if the signal is blocked, my concrete garage is a dead zone, my iPhone barely works in there too so I can't fault Tesla. So in my experience with automotive companion apps so far, Tesla's app is excellent."
787,Grshpr09,"July 27, 2017",4,"Almost There I'm pleased with the app but there's always room for improvement.  Most needed is a convenience feature  to unlock the trunk -or a particular door.  Sometimes it takes multiple attempts to unlock the charge port because it doesn't stay unlocked very long. The charge port unlock button should be moved to the home screen for easier access.  Accessing the cameras while parked, and accessing triggered footage via cloud would be cool.  There's an indicator for cabin temp but not battery temp, also would be nice to know when battery cooling system is on.  The location menu could show recent locations, recent top speeds and recent driving events -like sliding or hard braking, in addition to which key fob was in use.  And the ability to use the LTE connection for other devices would be great, especially in emergencies."

The app doesn't accept these characters but apparently only numbers and alpha, giving a password error if the my tesla accepted password has special characters. Lack of these characters weakens the strength of the password and a weak password could allow someone to damage an expensive car."

It wasn't broke, why did ya fix it?"
794,NaNurse,"May 30, 2013",4,"Great Start The app is literally on the verge of being indispensable.  It should however incorporate searching and the ability yo pass address information directly to the car navigation system.  In the location button of the app you can actually get directions to where the car is located so it seems adding the search and transfer features should not be that difficult.  The other missing feature is to be able to tell the car when to start charging and also, based on the outlet you are plugged into, the estimated time to a full charge.  Quite frankly for a first version of the app, it really is very nice."
795,C.M..,"August 21, 2013",4,"Great but needs push notifications for errors Love this app but I would really love to have a push notification in the event that charging is stopped.

Not sure whether it is a power source interruption or a human interloper, but it really ruins my day when I get to the car at the end of a work day and charging had stopped hours before. I know I can go back and constantly check the app on charging status but a notification would save me the time and hassle.

If for theft liability the windows and sunroof can't be opened fully remotely, then show the slider in the correct location, but only allow it to be changed out of open state, not into open state.

Most of the time performing an action like turning on the climate controls first involves watching a spinning ball(?) and waiting for the needed screen to appear. There is a significant lag between requesting something and actually getting it. With this newest version of iOS 10 the Tesla app crashes when trying to view Notifications under the Home screen. Whatever handshaking or waking up is involved is just very slow. On the plus side, the app is very capable once it does get to the correct screen or control."

Also, the keyless feature is an EXCELLENT idea, however, I would like to see Tesla incorporate TouchID on the iPhone instead of a password.  That would be a much better ""workflow"".

Why can't I activate heated seats/wheel from the app like you can with other cars? My rump will always be cold when I sit. Change the charging amps? Nope. Activate rear window, mirror or wiper defrost? Nope. Close any open doors? No way. But a new sideways view of the Tesla as displayed in the new app? A must have!"

I know where I am. I want to see where the car is. When I zoom in to see the car and then switch apps, when I switch back I see an empty map because the car moved but the map did not.

819,Kate B.,"February 21, 2017",2,"A good app is just crap now The old app wasn't perfect, but at least it worked. This updated version does nothing new other than enabling the Summon feature. It also looks prettier but nothing works anymore.  More than half the time when I open this app, the updating wheel of death spins and spins but nothing happens. Next time, please add some new functionality like the ability to change rate of charge; turning on heated seats, windshield, and back defrost; and closing open doors. In the meantime, would you please just fix the bugs?"
820,TheAustinNY,"February 4, 2013",5,"App-gasm! This is why I bought a Tesla :) Awesome App...And, from what we know about Tesla, they will continue to improve this App and add functionality based on owner feedback. "
821,Plazman888,"June 14, 2013",4,"Okay, but needs work It's okay, but it needs work. It fails to vent the pano roof almost all of the time, and it's really annoying that each tab loads separately. You made contact with the car, is it that difficult to download all of the data at once? Instead you have to wait over and over every time you tap a tab to see what the charge rate is, what the temperature is, etc."
822,Cxmoore,"September 12, 2014",4,Great car and great app! All features seem the same so far with the promise of new functionality coming with the firmware update for the car. My wheels on the car in the app have never matched mine and still don't. Minor complaint. Notifications will be nice when implemented. So much more could be done with this app. However it's still better than anything else that's been done before.
823,SRLMD,"February 26, 2016",4,"Great App! Although some reviewers seem miffed that more updates haven't been made, this app works as advertised. I love the ability to preheat my car and to follow the charging level remotely. The summon feature is cool but I have only tried it a couple of times. It works best to ""show off"" the capabilities of my Tesla to fiends! The other features work also but honestly I don't have much use for them. I'm very happy with the app."
824,Jarfman52,"January 8, 2017",5,Winter Improvement Suggestion Live the app.  Suggest you expand remote operations.
825,Cormander,"February 12, 2017",1,"Major update, major disappointment After four years, you'd think that a new major release would add major functionality. Not so. All we got was an interface redesign, the odometer reading, and Touch ID support for the one thing I never use anyway."
826,Mikeeee !!,"February 12, 2017",5,"Award winning UI.  Very Responsive ! New features include the following:  1. Touch-ID security for starting car, 2. Widget control, 3. Odometer and VIN display, 4. Valet mode activation, 5. Unlock charge port.  The new design should allow for new elements to be added easily without redesigning the UI.  Would LOVE to see Apple Watch support, as well as new features like trip planning."
827,Cpulfer,"March 8, 2017",3,"Worked before. Not consistent now. The old app wasn't great but it worked. Since this latest update I've had connectivity issues. Hard rebooted the car and rebooted the phone = nothing. Uninstalled and reinstalled the App and I couldn't login to the app. Hours later the app allowed me to login but still wouldn't connect to my Model S. The following morning everything worked perfectly. Not certain what I did, but the app is pretty glitchy."
828,JAinCO,"March 24, 2017",3,"Latest update is faster but NO Notifications It's pretty cool being able to have a ""spare key"" in my phone & the ability to turn on climate control, etc. However... the ""notifications"" aren't logged anywhere in the app. They come up on the screen but go away & are not recorded anywhere once I open the phone. It would be very useful to have a log with details of notifications."
829,AWSOME much,"June 22, 2017",5,My opinion. We should be able to control more in the car. Touchscreen/ open up the cameras on the car to see if anyone is trying to get in or close to the car. This would be good for hit and runs. To be able to check the cameras(or open them up to see in real time).
830,Bobby Beau2ful,"August 27, 2013",4,Pros & Cons Pros: 
831,personalAccount,"October 23, 2013",5,"Excellent App I love the car and the app but I do have a feature request... Optionally display a notification (with chime) if the car is ""home"" for more than a few minutes but isn't plugged in. A few times I forgot to plug in and found my car almost empty in the morning."
832,Notaken,"September 23, 2014",4,"Good interface and smart controls Overall the app UI is polished and user friendly.  There seem to hardly be any major updates to it which keeps it stable, but it would be nice to have a few more features added.  For example, being able to note the floor I parked on when trying to find my car."
833,sleinbach,"April 17, 2015",5,"Like no other car This is obviously a Silicon Valley car, not a Detroit car. The app is basic in nature, but has room for feature expansion. It does things never thought of before in the automotive industry, so I am very happy with it. I look forward to new features in future releases."
834,Ljefe00,"January 17, 2016",3,"Takes too long to register my Tesla! Of course I want to play with the Tesla app, like all other features of the car, on my first day of ownership but it hasn't registered my new car yet after 16 hours.  I had to buy the Remote S app just to be able to try out some remote features."
835,murphy62,"April 9, 2016",3,Location window tracking failure When the car is being transported on a trailer the location window shows the last location where the car was turned on 99% of the time.  There are brief flashes of the current location but they are not long enough to be useful.  The current location is tracked correctly on the Home window giving street addresses.
836,gaborkarakas,"August 30, 2016",3,"Functionally ok but needs more It is a very useful app but 3rd party apps offer a lot more features in a slightly faster way. This is still (and likely will be) my only app that I constantly use with the car, just wish there was 1-2 developers fully dedicated to making the online experience better with these expensive and beautiful cars... Tesla please spend more effort on this app!!"
837,itunesask,"February 11, 2017",4,"A welcome refresh but no new features The previous version of the Tesla app was in desperate need of a refresh and that's exactly what this app gives us.  The only new ""feature"" is Touch ID support for keyless start.  It's a pity because we're obviously spoilt by Tesla constantly upgrading our cars we sort of expect new functionality with a major revision update of software like this."
838,Aarondbrowm,"February 18, 2017",1,"Disappointing Connection issues, lack of basic controls, no new features. Come on tesla, I know this app doesn't generate revenue for the company but as owners, we have paid through the nose for A+ level technology and the app leaves so much to be desired.  We should have all key controls and instant connection especially when ""always connected"" is enabled. We should also have a an awesome watch app.  "
839,Departing customer,"July 7, 2017",1,"This app is the worst The Tesla app is the crappiest app I have ever used.  Works maybe 10% of the time, otherwise gives you a bunch of crap about ""vehicle connection error"".  Have been through the advised settings in the car and still crap results for both me and my wife, the car owner.  So glad I don't own one of these cars as the crappy app is beyond frustration.  Yes, have done all the software and app updates, and the lousy performance is the same.  Nice idea Elon, but I have to concede that the shorts on TSLA are correct and will win in the end."
840,GT,"February 4, 2013",5,Revolutionary Just can't describe what the car's like - and this app makes it even better. The latency between pressing the app button to honk the horn or flash lights is  generally in milliseconds. And that's from the app's cable modem connection to the car's built-in cellular connection.
841,ttttennis,"January 9, 2014",5,"Fantastic car and app. Update: app is now much faster, many thanks!"
842,7jonny11,"June 1, 2014",5,"LOVE IT If you're a tesla owner, having this app definitely enhances the experience more. "
843,Thesources,"November 8, 2014",4,"More features!!!! Great app. Needs way more features. The technology is there, implement something new with each release. "
844,Ace718,"August 24, 2016",4,Please add Contacts/address book support Would just like to request to allow users to upload latest contacts data to car's phone and navigation system to reduce typing of destination address data when already saved on the phone's contacts.
845,caliguy134,"February 11, 2017",4,"Great redesign!! Would love Apple Watch compatibility... The new tesla app is fast and responsive... love the home screen and widget access! Calendar sync doesn't work, with the screen saying in need to enable notifications, which I have. Besides that and the desire to be able to control your tesla with your Apple Watch, this is a welcomed update!"
846,dannyp2313,"February 12, 2017",3,"What's the point This ""New"" app still has the same functions as the last app and far fewer functions then a lot of the other tesla control apps available. Please add defrost and heated seat on off function. Also would be nice to do trip planning from an app instead of sitting in my car in the garage to figure out supercharger charge times for my upcoming road trips!"
847,Bobokooney,"February 16, 2017",3,No submit feedback and location has a MAJOR flaw This app works well as long as you don't need to know the vehicle location when someone is towing it! It has a major flaw and does not show the location correctly if the vehicle is in parked mode but getting towed. It also has no way to submit feedback to the developers or I would have done that!!
848,DrumDoc5,"March 9, 2017",3,Widget and 3D Touch takes a while to connect What's the purpose of a widget or quick 3D Touch shortcuts if you have to wait for it to connect to the car before being able to toggle functions ON/OFF?
849,capt996,"April 18, 2017",1,"Terrible redesign Poor redesign of the app and app cannot determine if it is connected to car or it until you activate a function. Previous app immediately was connected to car or started the attempt to connect to the car. This new version when you open it makes you think you are connected to car, including position , than when you try to activate AC or honk horn it suddenly says not connected. "
850,PrimeCipher,"April 21, 2013",5,"Excellent Tool for an Amazing Car! I love the app but can't wait for some improvements to be implemented - e. g. more granular charge time settings, ability to change charging amperage, window and trunk controls, alarm notification and controls, rear defrost control, iPad app."
851,danacan211,"April 23, 2013",4,"Please, please add door and hood controls The car is amazing but the fob is like a watermelon seed. I lost it inside the car after it squirted out of my pocket. Since there's no key, there's no chain and I don't have anything else that uses keys"
852,BTesla,"June 20, 2013",5,"Great App.. 1 bug This Tesla app works great. The only bug I have found is when you choose ""Vent"" the sunroof, it takes a long time, then opens and closes the roof immediately and shows Closed again."
853,EvaMOJarrell,"October 2, 2013",5,"Fantastic Way to watch my Model S! I love this app! Hope you plan to upgrade for different battery options, ie 60, 85, P85, P95+... Also looking forward to having an alert for the alarm. Thanks so much for making this wonderful car even better"
854,El Buscadorik,"June 26, 2014",1,"Good intentions - rarely works This app is a nice feature from the pioneering car company Tesla. It is supposed to help you find your car using your phone's and the car's GPS's, and also remotely control its climate, flash the headlights, honk the horns, etc."

856,jwcollard,"October 31, 2014",5,Starting in 6.0 fantastic wish it used touchid This app is best part of a great car. Here in Florida turn on air before going to car no more sweating for the first 5 minutes in a suit. Now with version 6 no key required to start just bring your phone .
857,TekKing,"January 29, 2015",4,Great app.  Just a couple of enhancements would be nice. I precondition the temp everyday and haven't needed to wear a coat yet this year!
858,Lovepolly,"May 16, 2016",5,Great compliment to an amazing car Nice basic features and some extras like being able to control the climate control remotely. Great for when my daughter falls asleep in my car and I let her sleep in the garage in a perfect 72F environment. 
859,Dr. Darrow,"March 7, 2017",1,"Come on Tesla Despite the fact that the app lacks a number of features I would like to see, the most annoying thing is that I now frequently have to reset the screen in my car to get this app to connect to it. Really defeats the purpose. I realize this may be an issue with the car's software and not this app, but either way, PLEASE fix it!!! Getting a little tired of making mental excuses to myself to justify my spending $140+k on a rolling software glitch. Please! ! ! !"
860,DakotaD215,"February 4, 2013",5,Oh heaven Just got my 60kw tesla yesterday.  Can't wait to try out the app.   Literally an amazing vehicle.   Every person I showed the car to today (from parents to 10 yr old kids) asked how to get one.   Nothing compares to tesla on market today.   Darius D.
861,kaybid,"February 4, 2013",5,"Great This is really handy. The remote climate controls and state of charge alone are wonderful, but the roof venting, locator functionality, and light/horn controls will be fantastic in big parking lots. Bravo!"
862,Fizzazle,"February 4, 2013",5,"Tech-tastic! Everything works great! (GPS location, honk horn, flash lights, vent sunroof, pre-heat/cool cabin, charging status, etc)."
863,BitsyK,"February 5, 2013",4,"Thank goodness Have needed this to combat frigid New England temps! Only way to heat up my car is with app since wicked cold temps (even with garage storage) leave big display frozen black until driven for about 15 min. Had to use touchscreen blindly to estimate function locations (like open charge port, garage door close, defrost, etc. ).  Tricky."
864,Jaiswals,"September 13, 2015",5,"Great app Need to have this. I use this to track my car in the parking lot, monitor location, temperature, charge etc. love the notification feature when I receive alerts if the charging is interrupted or complete etc. great job Tesla👋👋👍👍"
865,JL458,"February 26, 2016",5,Amazingly standard! I cannot believe that this is a zero cost feature for the Model S! I paid a great deal for less features on my previous Mercedes' mobile connectivity. Good on Tesla for a well integrated product!
866,WOC81,"March 1, 2016",5,"Love this App!!!! Don't let these bad reviews fool you... This is a FREE app!!!! That being said, Tesla did a GREAT job IMO at delivering an app that really puts you in control even when you're not close to the car at all.... Yeah there are some features I wish this app included but like I said it's FREE!!!"
867,GreggumFinch,"April 19, 2016",5,Works just like the car.. PERFECT Does everything it says it's going to do. Never crashes. Always works. Did I mention that this is also an unbelievable car. So why wouldn't the app be just as perfect.
868,Jmusic37,"April 21, 2017",4,"Can we get a timer function? The app is great except for I would like to be able to change the charging scheduled time. Sometimes I need it to start later and I'm not in the car and I have to go out and do it in the car. I know, I know, first world problems!"
869,D678770,"May 17, 2017",4,Overall great app Great because it actually exists and allows you to monitor and control basic functions.  So much more could be added...would love to have access to more of the features in the car. Camera access is at the top of my wishlist.
870,birenp,"February 7, 2013",4,"Passcode Main complaint is that the app does not have its own passcode to access the app. If u lose your phone, someone would know where your car is from the app and then could unlock it easily. Please add a passcode similar to the viper smart start app. Thanks!!"
871,nooy522,"February 8, 2013",5,"Excellent This is a must have app for Model S owners, making the car even better than before! Can't wait to see what's available in future updates (hopefully timed charging)."
872,Stephano32123,"March 23, 2013",5,Simple Elegant! First what a car!!!  I never believed that my driving experience would be altered so drastically!  I love seeing other Teslas on the road.
873,woowoostick,"May 25, 2013",3,No demo mode? The ford c-max energi app has a demo mode which is fun to see what the app can do. Having a demo mode might be a bit of a sales device and let more people see how this app can function with this car and possibly sell more cars.  
874,-aono-,"June 23, 2014",3,"Good app, but often looses link with car I don't what the problem is, but I often loose link with the car. I then have to restart the car's large screen manually, and then after approx 15 min the app (and the car) works properly again."
875,Ddpesq,"September 12, 2015",3,"Needs more control options! This app is just way too basic, and the other ones aren't much better. You should be able to open or close windows, disable vehicle, get alerts if alarm goes off, TURN ON HEATED SEATS AND DEFROST FRONT AND BACK, control radio like a remote, etc. This is Tesla, the most sophisticated computer car in the world. Come on."
876,Jeter74,"October 3, 2015",5,Great app!!! Works great as long as car is in coverage area. One suggestion is to allow climate to turn on front and rear defrosts in the AM so I don't have to wait to clear the windows when I get in car if parked outside on cold night.
877,Bryan K,"October 1, 2016",3,It's not perfect but will do for now The app does take a bit to load car options but it better than other manufacturers. Could use some updates but aside from slight lag it does work. 
878,Imajoe,"February 11, 2017",4,"Useful app, needs update Excited to see an update for the larger screens and a new flat icon. Thanks. "
879,Tino Scheder,"July 30, 2017",5,Simple and useful All important features accessible with 1 or 2 taps. Wouldn't mind to have a frunk/trunk open button and be able to customize the charge settings! Otherwise great app!
880,Tudor10,"March 27, 2013",3,"The app WAS great until they did the update You had the perfect app for the Tesla. Now that you made an update, it is not reporting the correct Milage. The app shows a much lower Milage vs actual. Plus the purple color during the cooling stage is very confusing. Please make do another update please. We like the old app much better."
881,Doc Aloha,"May 4, 2013",5,"Unreal!!! My Model S was delivered today. An iPhone application that allows you to check the battery, flash the lights, honk the horn, open the charging port and even find your car!!! Amazing!!!"
882,JoeApp,"January 25, 2015",5,"almost perfect desperatelt needs the function to remotely roll down windows 2” (to vent heat on a hot day, prior to turning on AC remotely). Displaying the real-time window position also a great idea (so one could confirm windows are up if in the office and it starts raining)"
883,gwexler,"February 10, 2015",5,Well designed! A very well designed mobile application. Would like to see notification from car to app in case of a break in.
884,Tcandmm,"April 3, 2015",3,"Good But Some Flaws Overall a good app and well ahead of other car makers, but from time to time the app does not inform me when the charge is completed. Also it would be nice if the app can include map search that would allow user to send address to the car's navigation."
885,JC-PV,"November 14, 2015",4,"Solid. Needs Watch Support This is a solid, predictable must-have app that does all an S or X owner needs. Watch support is seriously needed. Now that the ""other"" app has been abandoned by its developer and no longer works, Tesla needs to fill the watch gap with this very stable app."
886,HJS NYC,"May 17, 2016",3,Disappointing Crashes every time I go to notifications. 
887,Orlando_Jack,"January 10, 2017",3,"Wi-Fi yes, Cellular no I just traded in my 2013 Model S for a 2016 Model S and although there was no difficulty, other than slow to load I was able to connect iPhone 5 and then iPhone 6s with the 2013. Now, only on Wi-Fi connects to the app and the car. Cellular ""cannot connect"" Tesla Support had not heard of or could offer a solution."
888,StillframeGuy,"February 11, 2017",3,"Cute but no new functionality I'm glad they gave the app a new interface, however there is no new functionality. The only difference I've seen is that charging no longer shows volts and amps. :-(  Would have rated higher if they added anything; seat heaters, lower/raise windows, etc."
889,dcallas,"March 16, 2017",1,"Big step backwards I like the look of the new app, but the functionality has suffered a LOT. I can't connect to the car ~50% of the time and there are still some obvious features a car/app like this should have (like data logging, climate control schedules, access to screen grabs, live view of the rear camera, and many more). Huge fan of Tesla but very disappointed with this rare misstep."
890,hallkevin,"February 4, 2013",5,Useful Tool All of the features work well.  I really like the location tool.  I will use this often to ensure that the car is locked and preheat and cool before I go out in the morning.
891,Vista Clara,"February 5, 2013",5,Excellent This Model S is the most amazing product! I thought the iPhone was the best design of any product I had experienced until I received my Tesla. Just incredible! And this app is as well designed. Kudos Tesla!
892,robkal007,"February 5, 2013",5,Finally and Fantastic Great use of our connectivity. Will be great to start charging late at night without going out to garage. Cooling started before returning from the mall will make everyone envious.
893,Babyrocket,"February 7, 2013",5,"Every Model S owner needs this Clean, simple and great functionality - just like the car.  Extremely useful app, can't wait to see what other features Tesla rolls out over time!"
894,EDDIE APPS,"January 1, 2015",4,"Good and intuitive app for Tesla owners Functions work pretty well, but sometimes the key fob function doesn't work - everything else is great. A graphics update for the iPhone 6 Plus/iPhone 6 would do a big favor."
895,Zaza2q,"January 15, 2015",5,Good start ... Much more to do The app doesn't have notifications for an open window or roof that could be left open. That would be very useful.
896,MalibuWaveRider,"August 20, 2015",4,"Low tech app for a high tech car Tesla can do so much more with this app. It's simple, it's easy to use and it's clean but mostly because of its limited functionality. "
897,mrjohnnycat,"October 3, 2016",5,Love the App Look forward to more functions like time to start charging and when to stop.
898,mhlester,"February 11, 2017",4,"Major improvement The app looks much sharper than the previous dated look. Having a today widget is fantastic, and Touch ID remote start is much appreciated. The only addition I'm still waiting for is an Apple Watch app."
899,master of machines,"March 18, 2017",4,"Works fine Aesthetic changes from last version, but works fine. Not sure why the other reviewers had problems. Could be more functional, but works."
900,Hover MCO,"February 4, 2013",4,"Great car, great app! Tesla even matches the color of your car to the photo of the car in the app!"
901,Straggler,"February 9, 2013",4,Tesla App Glad this has finally arrived! Works great! Perfect basic functionality. Can't wait for future updates. It would be nice to have the supercharger locations available. Also would be nice to turn on seat heaters.
902,JerryTeslaOwner,"March 23, 2013",3,Charge option I like all that it does but it is lacking...
903,MattD_Pilot,"November 27, 2013",5,"Great app Elegant, simple, beautifully designed.  More features can be added later but all the essentials are there -- just like the Model S. It just keeps getting better!"
904,Gr8Barn,"March 31, 2014",1,"Okay App, doesn't live up the the standards Surprisingly this app controls very little of the car. For basic things like location, temperature control and lock/unlock, it does as good as a job as any app out there for any car. "
905,blue pacific,"December 7, 2014",5,Great app! Gotta have it for road trips My hubby has this app and loves it so I downloaded it too. So convenient when you're in a restaurant or mall and your car is charging at the nearby supercharger.
906,Michael & Lisa,"March 4, 2016",4,"Needs fingerprint recognition The app is very good on serval areas of basic operations. Please integrate fingerprint recognition into the Apple iPhone, Watch and iPad."
907,AppleNuts,"June 23, 2016",2,Missing features and now crash prone This last update crashes upon opening notifications menu. I am also sad that this app still doesn't offer all possible vehicle control functions and even change settings remotely. And how about finger print ID to unlock?
908,Jmonsterflex,"February 11, 2017",5,💯 Finally an update! New app is rad.
909,HBK IV,"July 10, 2017",5,No complaints The app does what I want it to do.  Could it use some more features like iwatch compatibly sure.  Overall satisfied with no usage problems.
910,David Bourne,"February 5, 2013",5,Awesome functionality Everything's works perfectly and instantly and the features are very handy!
911,Odenator,"February 9, 2013",5,"Excellent app Love this app. Works real well. No issues so far. Could be improved if it allowed programmable timed charging, remote control of charging amperage and programmable timed climate control."
912,Shawnie B-rizzle,"February 18, 2013",5,"Non-Owner Demo? It would be great if non-owner enthusiast could demo this app with a virtual Model S. Perhaps tie it to GPS and maps to test the various battery range options based on an individuals commute, climate and charging habits."
913,DJ Frustration,"June 11, 2013",5,Remote Control Your Model S Awesome app that lets you control multiple aspects of your Tesla Model S. uses a clean UI with about a 3 sec delay between button push and action.

915,Leonardo DaVinci,"April 3, 2014",4,"Wonderful, like all Tesla products. This app is easy to use and never fails to work. Typical great Tesla product. No glitches. "
916,Vynn,"January 8, 2015",5,Better with every update! The new 2.2 version of the Tesla app improves calendar support and looks like it finally supports the increased native resolution of the iPhone 6! 👍👍
917,KarlZIII,"April 21, 2016",3,"Adequate but not Tesla worthy The app does what it says and no more. The map (used in ""Location"") is so outdated it must be two years behind. It would also be great to access additional controls of the car (windows, roof, trunk, frunk, media, additional summon capabilities...)."
918,Glusc,"August 18, 2016",1,"App is crashing!!!!! This app was good when I installed it for the first few hours. But when I used it for the first time to monitor my first charge on the model s, the app crashes, freezes and won't load on to any of its feature pages. I even closed the app and reopened, no success after 10+ retires. This is ridiculous and needs to be addressed ASAP!"
919,Palma Chris,"March 7, 2017",1,"Waste of space The old UI was ugly, but at least it worked. Now I get the spinning wheel of death and can't access my car at all. Deleted app and downloaded again, still nothing.

927,Wabaadu,"February 16, 2017",1,Stuck in service mode Picked car up from tesla north houston.  App reported that car was in service mode. Got home still in service mode.  Waited 5 hours and called tesla.  Asked to wait another hour as tech forgot to close the work order.  Waited till next day and was told I need to leave feedback on the App Store. Please resolve this.  I appreciate it.

933,TeslaOwner,"January 8, 2017",1,Horrible App I've been using the App since September and it is dismal at best. The App is constantly not loading and telling me the car needs to be awake. I use the App to summon the car in and out of tight spaces and literally had to climb through the passenger seat to get in the car because the App would not load. This App blows big time.
934,sportsFan80,"February 11, 2017",4,About time It's about time a ultra modern car got a modern non pixelated app. Good job with the UI refresh now please add some new features to this app. Getting Chris Lattner onboard is paying off already!

943,nemorino_99,"February 27, 2016",3,"Good app, could be better The update states improved summon experience. There is no summon experience now or previously, so how is that improved. App is also extremely slow to load."

948,Jswlim.au,"April 21, 2017",2,Location no longer working Got the update and the location of my car no longer shows in the app? Seems to be a bug in the latest version.
949,Joywhitehill,"May 10, 2017",2,"Lost Touch ID authentication setting This update reset the setting. I had it enabled on previous version. This required me to sign in using password. Also the app doesn't use SafariWebCredentials , making it hard to enter the complex password stored on device."
950,Mike_Schlechter,"February 4, 2013",5,Model S Great addition to a great car. The ability to preheat is massively useful as is the charge toggle from standard to range.

958,m22b22,"February 19, 2017",2,Can't connect This app can't connect to either of my Teslas. Gave two stars because at least there was effort put forth to update it. Rather have the old app at this point because it could actually connect!

1081,ChaseDr,"February 5, 2013",3,Why wouldn't you have this app?! It's been a long time coming and while my car isn't here until April. I played with someone's app who just got theirs. It's a good app for a great car! Obviously the fact that the car has an app takes it to a level most cars can't even come close to.
1082,5minuteFix,"February 5, 2013",5,Great App Clean UI
1083,WSLam,"January 22, 2016",3,Determined It seems that Tesla is determined not to support the 6s/6s+ screen resolution.

1095,Weather Hound,"April 14, 2020",3,Wrong Car in App Just updated my Dec ‘17 MS from 2020.12 to 2020.12.5 and now the app shows a picture of the old style grill on my car. That’s not my car or how it used to be.
1096,Ap1s2k,"March 22, 2020",1,"Dumb app can’t even find my account I purchased solar from solar city.  That app was discontinued so I was told to download the Tesla app to keep track of my solar production.  I did that, tried to sign in and it says it can’t find products related to my account.  I go to Tesla.com and used the same credentials and logged in fine and saw my solar on the account.  I emailed support and was told to call support.  I did that, and they still can’t solve the problem of this dumb app."
1097,JPROFET,"March 21, 2020",2,App needs improvement This is great for newer models but for those of us that have purchase a Tesla’s when they where just coming out (2014-2015) this app is limited of what it can do.

1102,Airrun8,"December 13, 2019",3,"Nice little app However, this latest release digresses with interface design. Can you please make better use of all that empty space by making fonts bigger, please. Looks like it was designed for an Android phone."
1103,404##,"December 12, 2019",1,App stopped working No more solar data since 12/9/19.  If they can remote unlock a car they can surely show me my solar report. I shouldn’t have to go scroll through the inverter menu to see my data.  Nothing cool about that technology....
1104,Bobcsu2012,"December 10, 2019",3,"Same UI across all devices I wish they could have UI specific to device. On iPad it’s the same , Android, iphone it’s same. No apple watch . I believe it’s built using react native that’s why no Apple Watch and it’s same UI across devices which is good for developers but bad for consumers. Please release Apple Watch support to unlock car."

1108,TLM14941,"September 26, 2019",1,Tesla App is Light Years Behind Solar City App As a Solar City customer for the past few years I’m dismayed at the functionality of this app as compared to the Solar City App. I miss the real-time monitoring and that aside the display right now is 4 hours behind on my system so it can’t even show me hourly data. They can launch a Tesla into space but can’t write an app from code they had already acquired with the purchase of Solar City. I hope they fix this in a future release.
1109,G-twd,"September 21, 2019",1,Appalling customer service The app and the car are great. Tesla clearly employs great engineers.
1110,Rppg,"April 22, 2018",2,"App is not working Since yesterday 4/21/2018, the app is kind of erratic.  Yesterday afternoon was a maintenance message but now since last night is giving an “unknown error”.  Other than that, it should send notifications when the grid is down."

1113,TheLaurenator1015,"September 15, 2018",1,"Fingerprint Requirement This app controls your car’s security, essentially. It really needs to require a fingerprint to open the app itself. Like by bank app...you can’t access any of the info without either entering your username and password OR using your fingerprint. This Tesla app allows entry without either. It needs to log you out after a time out and ALWAYS require password entry or fingerprint authorization before giving you ANY access. I can see how that model 3 could’ve been stolen! 😱"
1114,rpc356,"October 4, 2018",2,"Battery usage I’ve had an M3 since 7/2018, so 3 months as of writing this review. My iPhone 8 works great as a “fob” and the app works fairly well for managing the car remotely (though there are some bugs). My biggest gripe, though, is battery utilization. With the current version my phone has dropped from 48 hrs. between charges pre-M3, to now 24 hrs. between charges. Looking at battery utilization in Settings, it’s clear it’s the Tesla app. C’mon, guys, you can do better."

1116,JewpiterJones,"December 5, 2018",2,"Slowwwwwww Takes way too long to “wake” the car, even when the car is connected to my home WiFi. I shouldn’t have to wait to wake the car to send commands. I should send the commands and get a push when they are received. Also, the app appears to be built with hybrid technology (ReactNative perhaps) so the fundamental UX is clunky and slow. Please rebuild with native code!!!"
1117,HeloCaptain,"December 21, 2018",1,"Start and stop charging - NIT Contrary to the app description, you can NOT start and stop charging. You stop charging, but you can’t start charging at any time. "
1118,ImranZ,"December 26, 2018",3,"So Limited The app works fine but it’s so limited in functionality. I should be able to control most car functions with it. I should be able to have Siri shortcuts like so many third party apps can, and tell Siri to open my Model 3 trunk etc. I should be able to share an address to the car GPS since Tesla refuses CarPlay and Android Auto. This app is just a bundle of un-mined potential. But I can unlock my car with it, so- yay?"

1124,Kidadly,"January 27, 2015",4,Tesla Owner I'm giving the app only 4 stars right now as it doesn't currently allow me to pull up an address and map in my phone and send it via the app to the car so that it loads into the NAV system before I get in the car.  BMW has this function and others I'm sure.
1125,Prefect,"January 10, 2018",3,There is so much untaped potential here Extend the REST API to the car and add lots of features!
1126,The Copey's,"February 23, 2018",1,Not working Since the upgrade to the app I am unable to use the app.  It would not update (last update 2/15/18) so I uninstalled/reinstalled the app and now I can’t even login.  Very disappointed!  I would give it 0 stars if I was allowed!
1127,Plutoftw,"April 22, 2018",1,Unknown Error - Cannot sign in anymore! I started getting an “unknown error” and the app could never refresh. I tried signing out and signing in—it said I had the wrong password or username. I use a password manager so I literally copy the login details in and there is no way for me to get it wrong. I tried multiple times too. Then I checked on the website—no problem. So I deleted the app + its data and reinstalled it—same problem. I have another phone with the Tesla app on it—unknown error. Never had problems before but now I’m locked out of the app. Please fix it!!
