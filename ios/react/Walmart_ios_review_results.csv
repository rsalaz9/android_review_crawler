0,2xl993,"April 28, 2020",5,"Excellent program I greatly appreciate thes service. Very easy to search thru the app to select the items you want. Prices are shown, and are the same prices as in the store. You can select to allow substituitions if the item you want is not in stock. When you pick up your items you can elect to not accept the subsitute, and you are given credit right away. If you select no substitues then if they do not have the item, it shows that in your delivery notice on the app - and not charged, of course. After you have completed your list, you can keep adding items, as you think of them, up to midnight the day before. When you later go back into the app to add to add items, your list does not appear. You go ahead and select the item(s) you want, click to purchase and it will ask if you want to add it to your current order. Click ‚Äúyes‚Äù then you can review your full order. They send you an email when it is ready for pick up (at the previous time you have requsted). You can also look at the app and see the progress as your order is being prepared. Then go to the store to the Pick Up area, park in front of a number and tell them you are there on the app. Or wait and they‚Äôll come out and ask your name. It‚Äôs all simpler than this LONG explanation. Great Servce."
1,Gaspatchosoup,"April 23, 2020",1,Gonna stick with Target As soon as I get my 2 items that I have coming that won‚Äôt come on time I will be deleting the app and never going to Walmart or using this service again.  So canceled the items I had in order and went to the target app and bought them there. Within 2 hours they get shipped and didn‚Äôt pay anything extra shipping.

3,I Who Shall Remain Nameless,"May 4, 2019",3,No Pay-and-Go I read an article that said that the Walmart Corporation planned to discontinue Pay-and-Go at Walmart but not at Sam‚Äôs Club. That was the first that I‚Äôd heard that Walmart has Pay-and-Go so I decided to try it. I was underwhelmed.
4,the good RN,"August 11, 2018",5,"Savings Catcher- it works!!! I have been using savings catcher for a year now, been working to catch Walmart NOT giving me deals that I know other stores offer. Nope! Walmart ALWAYS give me those deals, they never ever miss!  One time I thought they did but I found out I was wrong. The other store had gone up on their price and it was I that was not aware... If you shop at Walmart you‚Äôd better download the Walmart app, use savings catcher, and stop playing around! I‚Äôve already saved $65 so far without even trying, just buying my same ordinary groceries that I normally buy, not doing ANYTHING different. I don‚Äôt have time for coupons and price checking and stuff.  Wayyy too busy for that!  So, after I check out I get into my car, open the app real quick, scan my receipt real quick, then go home. Two days later I check the app and see the savings building up. Just that easy! Once I get to $100 I‚Äôll redeem it for something. And it‚Äôs fun, the kids love watching it build up, too!.. You all better get this little extra money, we all deserve a break so why not? üòâ"
5,Rtiger2,"November 9, 2018",2,"BRING BACK RECEIPT UPLOAD IN SAVINGS CATCHER I have been using the Walmart app, primarily for the use of Savings Catcher, for many years now. While I didn‚Äôt always get back tons of money, I always appreciated knowing that I was getting the best deal without shopping around while also being able to save my receipts digitally. I am incredibly disappointed in the recent move to linking receipt uploads ONLY through Walmart pay. I have chosen not to use Walmart Pay for personal and security reasons, not to mention that I also like to pay cash. This move (clearly to force users to use Walmart pay or miss out) disenfranchises so many users! There are many people who don‚Äôt feel comfortable using that pay method, or that just need to manually upload for many reasons. I know that you have lost me for sure from your app, and possibly from shopping as often, as receipt uploads to savings catcher made me shop there more often. If I can‚Äôt use Savings Catcher without being forced to use Walmart Pay, then this is no different than any other store... no more incentive to shop here. I genuinely want to use Savings Catcher and have the convenience of having receipts saved for me again. Bring manual uploads back and I‚Äôll begin shopping here more frequently again."
6,Bail e,"May 16, 2019",1,"App is not that great I only downloaded the app for the savings catcher. At one point, you were able to submit printed receipts via the app. Then, it was changed to where you have to use Walmart pay to get rebates on competitors prices. Some weeks, no prices were better. Other weeks I was getting several dollars back per receipt! Walmart released an email yesterday stating they would end this in May because their prices were often cheaper than their competitors. I feel that is a lie considering I usually get cash back from the app on 3/4 of the receipts submitted. I will use the app until May but after that I will delete it and shop with the competitors as opposed to doing all my shopping with Walmart. Most of the said competitors allow digital manufacturers coupons on their apps or loyalty cards. Walmart doesn‚Äôt have a loyalty card or an option for digital coupons on the app. It is virtually useless as I can do anything else from the app on their website. Once savings catcher is gone, it is a waste of space. I will be using the balance left over from the savings catcher and deleting this app. It literally will no longer provide me with any benefits that I cannot get from using the general website. Your competitors will be thanking me when they start receiving more of my business!"
7,Mandala221,"January 1, 2018",4,"Suggestions... I love using this app. It‚Äôs been so convenient so many times BUT when I‚Äôm trying to find a certain item and I‚Äôm inside a Walmart store, I can‚Äôt search other Walmart stores. Even if I change the location of ‚ÄúMy Store‚Äù to the location I‚Äôm trying to search, and even turning off my location, it still keeps me at the current store I‚Äôm in. This makes it difficult to search other locations without having to first leave the local store I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm trying to search a different store so I‚Äôll know beforehand if I need to buy a different product or order online. I‚Äôd like to search other locations while standing in one already! This has been an issue SO many times!"
8,LBoPres,"June 12, 2018",3,Reward dollars Walmart has initiated this app to keep their prices lower than their competitors which the whole point was for the customer to have an extra incentive to buy from Walmart and also for Walmart to always have lower prices than the competitors. But.....again Walmart has won and now you don‚Äôt rack up the reward dollars like you used to. I spent $600-$1000 per month and would get a substantial amount accumulated and I would save it up and I would purchase a big item. I have used it toward a $70 iron to a $250 pool. I enjoyed scanning my receipts....waiting to see how much I was going to get in return.....then deciding how long I wanted to accumulate them. Now.... Not so much now .....  I still spend the same amount and in the past eight months I have only accumulated $7.89 ü§ó.  Not much of an incentive to drive out of my way to a Walmart so I can save a dollar or two and then get to scan my receipt and then see that I didn‚Äôt even have any qualifying items.  I will just support my small businesses because at least I know that all the registers will be open.....the employees will be friendly.....and the owners will desperately appreciate my business.

10,Michelle & Christopher,"April 12, 2018",3,Walmart pay won‚Äôt work for security reasons??? !? I never write reviews but I came to look at the reviews to see if anyone else has the same problem turns out yes they do! I too have had Walmart savings catcher and the Walmart pay for forever now. I‚Äôve loaded hundred of dollars of gifts cards with no issue. Until the other day it‚Äôs declined for security reasons?? Use another payment. There‚Äôs plenty of money on there in e gift cards. Nobody in store or the 800 number knows anything multiple people in store and multiple transfers to departments at the 866 number and the end result was they will get back to me in 3-5 days by email with tech support! Reallly!!?? There‚Äôs no one to talk to? No one to rectify this now? Nobody to transfer to a tangible gift card so I can use it? I love my Walmart pay but now this has really put a wrench in my Walmart shopping. Come on Walmart there must be a better way ! why does nobody have an answer? Another solution they gave was to print the gift card and they can scan it. I sure hope that works although It really defeats the whole simplicity of Walmart payüòî I‚Äôm so disappointed!!!
11,SuzanneAZ,"June 15, 2018",3,Educate the Employees Between my husband and I we shop at Walmart 4-5 times a week for our growing family. We both use the app and savings catcher to help manage all of our receipts and to stay on budget for the month. 
12,Noodledoodle5,"November 10, 2018",2,See the stars falling off soon Hate the new system. It‚Äôs not like Walmart‚Äôs have WiFi. And most Walmart‚Äôs have really bad signals! Can‚Äôt bring up savings catcher/Walmart pay if you can‚Äôt get a signal to do so. 
13,HombreDeAcero,"November 28, 2018",1,"App and store don‚Äôt work well together for returns. I made a purchase using Walmart pay and all seemed good though I wish it would print a physical receipt. The big issue was when I had to make a return. I started my return on the app as it supposed to make things easier. When I get to the counter the lady is asking me why I‚Äôm returning for each item even though I answered all that on the app. Not only that but I had so wait and watch her open each and every single item. Once she finished she said I was getting a gift card. I said excuse me no. I used my card with ur app to pay I‚Äôm not accepting a gift card. She gets her lead who is rude and says the same thing and all she does is show me the screen that says gift card. I told her again I‚Äôm not accepting a gift card and she said it‚Äôs not our app. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt accept returns with purchases made using Walmart pay. I told her, Walmart owns the app and you work for Walmart and represent Walmart therefore you are Walmart and this is your app. Long story short I had to get two other managers before someone could figure out what to do. Not sure how this app is suppose to make things easier or faster but I‚Äôll tell u that returns line only got longer while I waited to resolve my issue. Hate Walmart."
14,Erotichotx3,"November 30, 2018",2,"New changes results in tons of lost savings This USED to be a great app to get the most out of your money. Submitting a receipt was super easy, and the process took less than 2 minutes. Now, you have to use Walmart pay which I‚Äôm sure has caused a ton of people to stop using the app altogether. Along with that, if you receive SNAP benefits, you can‚Äôt add your EBT card as a method of payment. Clearly the people using snap benefits needs the rewards/savings just as most if not more to maximize purchases. I had a lot of fun using this app before they switched it but unfortunately I do not feel comfortable linking my debit cards to pay at checkout, and I have to primarily rely on SNAP benefits at the time being to provide food for my family. I really hope Walmart steps up because that is discrimination towards people in poverty and members of the lower working class. Shame on them. A simply solution would be any savings rewarded from a purchase using EBT can only be redeemed for food items. Surely with the money Walmart makes they can afford to upgrade the platform to allow such purchases via this app. I‚Äôll check back in a few months to see if they‚Äôve worked this muck out. Disappointed!"
15,...kab,"December 14, 2018",2,"Savings catcher update.... I LOVED the old savings catcher program before October 28. I‚Äôm still one of those people who uses cash quite a bit, and to longer be able to put in my receipts for my cash purchases is so disappointing. I actually looked forward to putting in my receipts after each trip, and it was fun to watch my rewards add up over time. It gave me a incentive to shop there. I think in the past few weeks I‚Äôve been to Walmart at least 4 times a week, paid with cash, and have a stack of receipts I can‚Äôt even put in Savings Catcher. I know everyone will say to just deposit my cash and use my debit card, but I‚Äôve just always used cash, and our Walmart has some cash only registers that are quicker to get through. Also, with 5 daughters, it‚Äôs sometimes a hassle to deposit my cash, then go shopping, and to get my phone out and do the whole Walmart pay thing. On one of my visits, it froze up the whole self-check register and I had to re-ring my whole purchase at another register. Plus, using cash keeps me on a budget, and it‚Äôs just what I prefer. I wish you would consider bringing back the option to enter cash purchase receipts."
16,Very frustrated mom to be,"January 28, 2019",2,"Just save the trouble and use Target Creating a baby registry on this app is a NIGHTMARE. I‚Äôll start by saying that it‚Äôs very frustrating that the registry is not a separate app from the rest of Walmart shopping (like Target does), because it makes navigating back and forth to your registry SUPER inconvenient. Anyways, when first creating your registry, your first and last name is required, which is understandable, however, it will not let you create a custom name for the registry itself. So, you can‚Äôt match the name to any other registries you‚Äôve created for your shower. Then, before you even get to look at any items for yourself, it adds a long list of things it ‚Äúthinks‚Äù you may want instead of just suggesting them to you(LIKE TARGET DOES). Oh, but it doesn‚Äôt even end there! If you don‚Äôt like the certain brands of wipes/diapers, or prints of clothing it has chosen for your child, you‚Äôll have to go through a 2-3 step process for EACH item to remove it from your registry. Not to mention, half the things it added to the list are out of stock! If I had not already put on my invitations that I am registered through Walmart and Target, I would delete this registry altogether. Complete headache."
17,@zeus,"February 22, 2019",2,Needs to show everything not half the items When you try to find things in the store or scan things that are in the store because you just bought it and you want to buy more but your home not at the store it acts like it can‚Äôt find it or it‚Äôs not there even though if you go down to the store you can find it but it will show you the item that cost more so if I wanted to preset a few things for walmart and pick it up I wouldn‚Äôt be able to because according to the app Walmart don‚Äôt carry it but I can go to walmart look right at it and what do you know it‚Äôs there plus I can scan it to price check it or order it then and with the same app it then shows that‚Äôs it‚Äôs at walmart. 
18,Heathen101,"December 11, 2019",1,"Invasion of Pivacy!

19,Marcie H.,"August 22, 2019",3,"BRING BACK SAVINGS CATCHER!!! I‚Äôm EXTREMELY disappointed that you took Savings Catcher away!! It was a truly wonderful system that GUARANTEED I did absolutely ALL of my shopping at Walmart! After experiencing only a couple of minor user issues, I had no problems or complaints and managed to get back OVER $100 IN SAVINGS!! Because I usually had anywhere from $3-$10 in S.C. money available on my WalMart account, whenever there was an emergency of some sort that left our checking account empty, I was still able to make essential purchases (such as MILK, BREAD, TP, etc.) to get my family through till payday! More than ONCE we were able to manage thanks entirely to the S. C. program and I‚Äôve heard similar stories from friends who also utilized it. I was therefore SHOCKED and DISMAYED when I was told that the program had been terminated and no one could explain why. Not only THAT but WalMart doesn‚Äôt even do PRICE MATCHING anymore! "

21,lynnkennerly,"November 15, 2017",5,Order pick up at store So I went to Walmart to see about an LOL toy. I ordered it for store pick up and when I went to see about it because I wanted to be sure my email was right the manager said yes and they did have one left but had not found it yet and would email me. Later I got email saying my order was cancelled because it was now out of stock. I feel they should of asked if I wanted it cancelled or kept it on file like a first come when they did get a shipment. Not to mention my bank still shows this as a pending transaction and if I understand right I will have to check with my bank on this. Also for several times they say stores around me have limited or in stock on this item . I checked with at least three stores and they never even got any unless store employees got them first. I feel as though I should be given priority since I even had been given a confirmation number in the first place. 
22,Hogmanmike,"February 14, 2018",1,"App very slow to log in I have always had issues with the time it takes to log in to savings catcher. The developer help is worthless.

Tried an additional time to reinstall after talking with tech support on the phone, made sure my account was not blocked, now it says‚Äùoops, something went wrong, please try back later‚Äù.

23,Ahstewie,"May 3, 2018",5,"Great hidden features Sometimes you find you can benefit from an app, I recently switched to using just mobile data which means large apps and updates sometimes don‚Äôt happen, normally that would mean a visit to my local Apple store 50 mile round trip or Starbucks and buy a coffee just to go the updates."
24,HyruleHobbit,"May 25, 2018",5,"Fantastic!! I use this app only to scan my receipts after checking out from Walmart.  Once I scan it takes a day or two to let me know if they located any stores with a less expensive price on the products I bought.  If so, the extra amount from what I spent at Walmart goes into my Walmart pay.  I can either use this at Walmart or redeem it for Cash.  I tend to collect quite a bit from this. I‚Äôve gotten back around $40 so far.  I would have let this slip through my fingers!!  Sure, a ton of stores price match BUT!!!!! When those stores price match they give you the discount then and there.  This app located the difference and gives you the money, which is welcome near the end of a pay week.  Not only that but the app has different features, along with ordering online, ordering by scanning things on the barcode scanner (participating locations) and other stuff.  I love this app!"

28,Mumof06,"November 8, 2018",1,"Going to shop elsewhere! This used to be my favorite app and store to shop at. I even drive pretty far from my home to do my shopping. However, you have ruined this app. I have 4 receipts that I can‚Äôt upload because you have to use Walmart pay to load your receiptsat the time of purchase. So this takes the way I choose to save and pay out of my hands and gives it to you. Also, often times my husband will stop at night on his way home from work to pick up a few things and I can‚Äôt add those either. This app was pretty much the reason I‚Äôd go out of my way to shop at Walmart. I drive by a target, bakers, aldi, Whole Foods, and hyvee to shop at Walmart. I would also wait until my savings added up to a certain amount and then use it, if you‚Äôre forcing me to pay with the app, than it will use up my gift card each time. Making it feel like I‚Äôm not saving at all. Last thing, I have 7 kids, one is 3 months old, I don‚Äôt want to fuss with a phone while I‚Äôm trying to pay.

Now I usually can't search for items without an error which causes me to just go to the website. And for the past few updates, I've noticed that the app is not connecting to the internet. It doesn't matter if I'm on my wifi or using my phone's provider network, it doesn't work. The only way I can use the app is if I am at a Walmart, on their wifi. So if I forget to add my receipt to the savings catcher as soon as I check out, then I will not be able to add it. Usually by the time I'm back at the store is one week later and because you can't add the receipt 7 days later, you lose out. Anyone else having this problem?

Last couple of tries at using Pay, my iPod crashed, the app drained my battery, I got a Low Battery warning, and it shut down completely. So, I tried not even looking at my list in Notes, logging into the app at checkout. Placed the iPod over the terminal and tried to get it to scan (just for good measure I was on your WiFi), and it didn't drain battery immediately but due to overhead glare I think it would not read.... and then battery drained. Tried this at home an it is the QR scan that is draining the battery. Never happened before the Catcher was deactivated, a few months ago I could use the QR on the receipt to process Savings Catcher.

Walmart I had many problems ordering ex specially during Christmas I ordered a PlayStation and then right before they shipped it is said no longer in stock when they first said in stock .

As of October 29, 2018, customers will no longer be able to scan their paper receipts to participate in Savings Catcher. Everyone must pay via Walmart Pay to participate in Savings Catcher. Clearly, this is another blatant and disgusting act of greed on behalf of Walmart to place an additional burdensome obstacle in the way of customers trying to cash in on a few pennies back for every shopping trip to Walmart stores. Walmart prices are already overly-expensive and overinflated as it is, but Walmart doesn‚Äôt let that curb their greed. What if a customer pays cash and doesn‚Äôt agree to being forced into using Walmart Pay? In that case, you‚Äôre ineligible to use Savings Catcher. Walmart really needs to focus more on better customer service in their filthy stores and out-of-stock merchandise than trying to find greedy little ways to make their customers pay more.

Not everyone has or wants to use that. Secondly, are you employees not trained on how to bag the groceries? Since when do you put raw meat in the same bag as fresh produce? Or can food on top of fresh produce and/or bread products? Then there are the chemicals bagged here and there with other products. If you re-bag your groceries yourself then the cashiers want to be belligerent and rude. Then there are 20 some odd registers and never more than 4 open during peak time. I‚Äôve tried being patient and understanding yet it just gets worse each trip. I‚Äôve only been a handful of times this past month by shopping elsewhere. This requires an additional 30 minute drive and at times two stops, but I‚Äôm okay with that. I‚Äôve certainly not experienced as many panic attacks just trying to by groceries because people are rude and inconsiderate.

But I can control that by looking for packages that weigh closer to their estimate.  If I could find out how much I could save at Walmart I would probably bring my business there.  I realize that Walmart is a much larger company than Wegmans.  However, I do not see that as a reason that they cannot have their app work similarly.  It‚Äôs no secret that they have a ridiculous amount of money."

79,vroyo,"February 17, 2020",2,"Pharmacy App Dysfunctional I have been using the pharmacy function for the Walmart app for a few months now with no issue. For the most part, I had been able to easily refill my prescriptions at school and at home (in different states) without any trouble. In the past few weeks, the app had malfunctioned to the point that it has interfered with my medications. I often work the same hours as the pharmacy, so I don‚Äôt have the extra half hour to wait to get my meds refilled in person. I really rely on being able to refill through the app and pick up after work. Recently, the app has deleted one of my prescriptions without my knowledge and without notifying me of the ‚Äúchange of prescription number‚Äù that would allow me to refill through the app. Now I am off schedule for my medication AND I will have to spend an hour of my time that I don‚Äôt have to stand around and refill my medication at the pharmacy."
80,silent foamingo,"June 8, 2018",5,"Awesome App This App. Is so easy to use. I enjoy the savings catcher. Not only does it keep copies of all my receipts in one location, but the rewards help my budget. I know that if something is a lesser price somewhere else, I will get that difference back. No worries and no price matching. Also, the site to store shopping has no charges hidden, like some other stores...I can order special items in the right sizes, colors, etc. without running around searching. Best of all, I can pick up those items when I come I. For my groceries. New lower prices in the store, especially dairy have me actually staying and doing all my shopping.

83,TheTalentedMrJ,"October 30, 2018",1,"Savings Catcher - from hero to zero One of the highlights of the Walmart app has been the Savings Catcher feature.  It allowed you to scan your receipt and the app would compare competitors prices and if it found a lower price, the difference would be credited to your account.  The app will still do this, but unfortunately Walmart has now completely tied it into their Walmart Pay feature.  Meaning the only way you can use Savings Catcher is if you use Walmart Pay to checkout.  For families or those of us whose spouses are less digitally inclined, this means you can no longer scan their store receipt after they‚Äôve gone shopping without you and add it to Savings Catcher.  You must be there to use Walmart Pay (which doesn‚Äôt always work correctly or cashiers seemed confused by).  What may seem like a small change to Walmart in order to drive customers to use the Walmart Pay function is a major factor on why my family and I may be shopping there less."
84,Dmm1384,"November 3, 2018",2,Change Back Savings Catcher! I‚Äôm not sure what you guys were thinking when you decided to change the savings catcher option in your app. Making people use credit/debit/gift card at the register to get money back from savings catcher is RIDICULOUS! Some people prefer having paper receipts and being able to pay cash at the register. This change makes no sense. Also now you can‚Äôt scan your Walmart receipts in others savings apps like Ibotta since you need a physical receipt to do that. So now your making people chose how to save money. I loved the app and savings catcher before and had no problem with using Walmart pay to cash in on your savings catchers savings. Instead of the whole transfer to gift card. But to not allow people to scan their physical receipts is wrong and needs to change. I will not use this app till things change. What exactly were you thinking Walmart?
85,Coach Sheri :),"November 7, 2018",3,"Stock issues Love the app when it works, but it's definitely a gamble as to whether your items are actually in-stock or not. Several times, I've ordered items through the app or online, only to have them cancelled by WM because they weren't actually in-stock. What's even more irritating is that the cancellation usually happens on the day the item should be delivered. As a matter of fact, Monday I purchased 6 boxes of carpet tiles...each listed for 2-day shipping. The app shows 2 boxes being delivered today...the other 4 boxes are still showing as 'preparing to ship'...though they should ALL be delivered today. I won't be surprised if those 4 are cancelled soon because they probably aren't actually in-stock. This will be a further inconvenience because I will have to return the 2 boxes I am receiving today, as they are useless without the other 4 boxes.üò†"

Why in the world would I want items I already have in my possession delivered to me by mail days later????????? Had I known it was this ridiculous I would have brought my wal mart card instead of leaving it at home & trusting the app. No other means to pay so I had to leave my cart full of items there and walk out.

I was leery but I tried it and it seemed to be going good.  I had accumulated over $40 by last October when I first transferred to a gift card. About 5 months time from when I started using it. Shortly after I got the notice about them putting them on the card on their own.  Weird but whatever.  However in February, despite continuing to download every single receipt, and getting email after email that ‚Äúlower prices were found‚Äù, my card balance had not changed from the balance I had left from the original card that I had spent half of on an online order.  I emailed them repeatedly with no response so they clearly do not care that it isn‚Äôt giving me my savings back.  So I stopped using it in Feb.

Also, I have tried to use the Walmart pay and beware! They don‚Äôt give you a paper receipt. It wasn‚Äôt even an option! So for everyone who uses the grocery apps that require a paper receipt, you cannot use Wal-Mart pay. You would think it would be an option to get an e receipt or a paper receipt. Every other store that I‚Äôve encountered that gives e receipts asks you if you want one. Then we get to the issue that Walmart pay is extremely unreliable and often doesn‚Äôt work at all, claims your card is declined and closes. Then you use the exact same card to pay and it works just fine. What a complete waste. This app definitely needs work"

Forgot her card somewhere and didn‚Äôt have to leave the items behind just to come back and shop again. Unfortunately that has changed a lot over the past year. Today I attempted to use this feature and the issue wasn‚Äôt the app. The issue is the store. They blamed the systems multiple failures on incoming weather.

99,Ojmom5,"July 6, 2019",1,Pharmacy I have been dealing with Walmart for over 5yrs in Pharmacy. The year 2019 has been completely unsatisfactory in getting prescriptions filled through their app. You must do orders now with 72-48hours in advanced then you still have to wait on prescription. You received notification that presentation is due for refill and it‚Äôs 3+ days to get your monthly medications. Then there is a problem if you send refill order in too SOON?!? They have change in staffing and or under staffed. I even waited 3 days to wait on a prescription and was first told they didn‚Äôt have it on stock and it would have to be ordered. Then they call me and tell me that their manufacturer was what currently producing the medicine at this time. So  they checked with other Walmart that was completely out of my way and a total inconvenience for me as a customer. Why have the app if you still have to call or just go to the pharmacy and see what the problem is with your refill??

The aisle product view should automatically come up the same as the aisle in the store, all one type of product together and all products from the same vendor together (for example milk,  yogurt, snacks, laundry detergent, etc.). I shop by product, value and brand or vendor when I am in the store. It would improve my ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù shopping experience if i could do the same through the app (both Walmart and Walmart Grocery). Note: Your price sort does not work. These changes would make this a 5 star app for me, and in my opinion, for everyone. For it would also be helpful if the cart and the receipt would sort the same way."

I have also been using savings catcher for over two years and have found it awesome as well.  Generally I save my rewards up and then transfer to a gift cards prior to shopping for Christmas.  Apparently this year Walmart decided I was not capable of making this choice myself and now two months prior to Christmas my reward dollars have been auto placed onto a gift card that they then automatically have set as the primary payment method on Walmart pay.  I have went in and turned the gift card off so this is not being spent, but I detest that this decision was made for me by Walmart.

You shouldn‚Äôt have to navigate around the world to submit a receipt for the savings catcher.  Then when you go to scan a receipt it takes forever for the scanner to open up. The store I go to never has more than 2 registers open and no matter how many people in line they still don‚Äôt open one.  I still remember the old ads that said if there‚Äôs more than 3 people in line we‚Äôre going to open another line.  The items on the shelf are never rotated.  We keep finding stuff over a year out of date.  When you call the manager of the store they don‚Äôt seem to care.

The savings catcher is another great addition to the Walmart shopping experience. By scanning my receipts, Walmart gives me the difference from any of their competitors, within 3 business days.

129,Bhs2007,"April 20, 2020",1,Pathetic U better off going into the store to buy your items period. When u order something for it to be shipped to your house they take eternity to charge you then they ship your item .. Sounds good right ? No.. why cause for example if u have 500 bucks on your card and u ordered something for 300 bucks u better not spend NO MORE money after that cause they will send u a verification number that your order was confirmed but they take an extra two more days or 4 to actually ship your item then they charge u. The shipping has a fee so u better not buy nothing else or order anything else off your card after u made your order. Y‚Äôall Remember the ‚Äúwon‚Äôt ship your item until u pay for it first ‚Äú well with Walmart u can cancel that. Last Don‚Äôt do the ‚Äúpick up at store‚Äù orders cause it takes them 3 or more hours to actually have your item ready for pick up.

I contacted customer service the first few times it stopped working and each time the first questioned they asked was if I had tried to uninstalled and reinstalled the app. So apparently they know there is an issue and that is the answer because it does work, but only for a few days and I have to do it again...not ideal.

If this happened once in a while, that‚Äôd be one thing but the fact that it happens over and over again, is exhaustingly infuriating.

The only way to have known that would have been to show up physically to Walmart where the hours were posted. The Application said the pickup was open that day from 8am-8pm and the store itself was open 24hrs. Nothing about My store advertised hours.

I would often have my son pick up my grocery items from Walmart as we live 20 minutes away, but he works nearby. Savings Catcher would let me scan the receipts and save on the groceries that he bought for me. Now we're no longer allowed to add scanned receipts, there's much less incentive to shop for my groceries at Walmart. I'll have him go to one of the grocery stores, which are closer to his workplace, anyway. "

I have multiple apps where I scan receipts and get money back but with this Walmart one it keeps my receipt disabling me from being able to take pictures of it for other apps and I like to have digital copies of my receipts but I can not with this app now, it cuts all the items off.

First off, getting to the Walmart Pay screen to pay takes far too many screen selections.  After self checkout, it looks like you‚Äôre playing with your phone but you‚Äôre clicking through a maze of selections to get to Walmart Pay. Make a single, stand-alone icon for Walmart Pay rather than having to navigate through the app to get to arguably the most utilized part of the app. Second, finding the order status is so clumsy.  Account>purchase history>scroll around until you find it. Make this easier, instead of mixing online orders with in-store purchases."

That is my biggest negative remark. The others are that the app and in store NEVER match on anything, quantity, price, etc!!! Quit shoving Walmart pay down your customer‚Äôs throats!!! The success of something is a direct result of meeting the needs of all clientele not just one group of that clientele!! I will not change my needs to suit your idea of how I should shop.

Worst of all employees don't know how to use it and tell me they ‚Äòhate that thing‚Äô. I was old i could select to not use my card stored in the app, followed the instructions in settings but the setting didn't stay resulting in the app charing almost $200 to a credit card i specifically said no to.

Called back the next morning to find out they never received my refills order and one of my meds had no refills. They could not answer why this happened and gave me 1-800-Walmart to call. Well I called them and they told me it was because I didn‚Äôt have full access so I couldn‚Äôt order thru the app until the pharmacy gave me full access. But the app told me it was process.

I like many others barely trust Walmart to know my gift card number let alone give them my credit or debit card number. I‚Äôm sure this is just their way to slowly stop the savings catcher program, as I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre burnt out on having to give money back to its customers.

Aside from the ‚Äúin stock‚Äù issue that plagues this app, one major issue is that it oftentimes updates which aisles things are in when the store itself hasn‚Äôt updated the aisle (ex. product A being in aisle M but the store not even having an aisle M). That aside, the worst decision Walmart has made in recent years is taking the Catching Saver away from us. We now are forced to pay using Walmart Pay. Why is this an issue? Because many of our banks do not support such things and therefore our cards cannot be entered into such a system. Many of us also find it easier to simply scan our own receipts.

This is pretty crappy and unfair. One of the main reasons we shopped at Walmart was because of the ease and efficiency of their discount catching program. It worked and it worked well! We never had to worry if we were getting the best prices. Now we cannot submit any of our receipts unless we pay through Walmart Pay. Like I said, that doesn‚Äôt work if we pay in cash which we always do. Walmart please fix this issue on your app and bring back what originally worked. If it‚Äôs not changed back to the original format we will just shop at other stores from now on because we aren‚Äôt saving anyhow. Highly disappointed."
213,n8ivebadboy,"December 18, 2018",2,Double billing on bank account. I ordered for Christmas twice. on the first time they put the hold on the account no big deal but they put it on there twice I had bills to pay also. Thinking that was a one time thing I ordered again the second time got email said they cancelled my order because they couldn't verify some of my info. Low and behold the billed a hold on my account for the amount twice in on a budget and billing twice isn't right you get it back but still messed me up. And this second one was cancelled it says. Cause they couldn't verify my info if that was so how did you put a hold on my bank. I don't get it. This is just heard it the online service in store is great. Problem needs to be addressed.
214,aja10243,"February 19, 2019",1,One reason I liked going to Walmart was for the saving catcher Walmart says there all about the customers but that must not be the case. Cause one since they changed saving catchers I have had nothing but problems. They need to bring back where we can scan our own receipts. I have lost so much money now due to either the app not working or the machine won‚Äôt let me scan it. So now like last night when going to Walmart the app wasn‚Äôt working and I couldn‚Äôt scan the machine to save my receipt to get money back. So now again I‚Äôm loosing money cause I can‚Äôt scan my own receipt. I‚Äôm not the only one that doesn‚Äôt like this new process and should go back to how it was. If it‚Äôs not broke than don‚Äôt try to fix it. So give the customers what they want and bring back scanning our own receipts.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs related to the iOS 13 upgrade but ever since the upgrade I am unable to enter two receipts in sequence into the Purchase History without closing out and reloading the app. The app will advise me to manually enter the second receipt number almost every time. If I close the app and reopen it it will work fine. IPhone 6s. A few times the app will tell me a product is out of stock when I‚Äôm I'm actually looking at it sitting on the shelf.

So basically, it‚Äôs another paper weight app that won‚Äôt do any of the things it was designed to do. The saddest part is that it used to be a great app. But after all the changes, this crappy app is literally the only way to get the cash back savings on your card. Ugh!

Is it too much to ask for me to choose when I want to update the app on my phone!? Stupid lazy programmers can‚Äôt even put in a simple ‚Äúupdate later‚Äù option! Seriously? Are u dumb programmers?

Now it still works for finding items but not as well. When you put in like real lemon juice for an example. It will show you all kinds of items but the lemon juice is way down the list and it only shows the one for Iberia and not real lemon juice nor the squeeze ones. Allot of the grocery items are like this now. 3 weeks or a month ago it would tell you exactly where they were at to of list and now it only shows some of what you put in if any and not all as well as stuff not even related to what you put into the app.

It‚Äôs amazing when you can find your stuff and all that time it takes to find it.

However, the savings catcher does not keep up with local prices. Add to that the fact that receipts I submitted weeks ago show there are lower prices but it still says receipt submitted instead of being processed and $ credited to the account, it‚Äôs become more of a hassle than it‚Äôs worth. Now, I‚Äôm being told it will only work with Walmart pay... there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm linking my bank account to something that can easily be hacked. I‚Äôve chosen Walmart over other stores because of the services offered. With these services being stripped down, I‚Äôll just drive the same distance the opposite direction and go to Winco."

I liked accumulating the savings for those times in between paychecks when my cash was low. Other grocery stores are farther away or are a few cents more expensive so it ‚Äúseems‚Äù inconvenient to go to them, but they have no lines or nearly no lines, they are cleaner, friendlier, and keep their products stocked. So I just don‚Äôt have a reason to go to Walmart anymore. I did try ordering online because I thought that might be a nice convenience after I broke my ankle, but that was a joke. I tried it several different times. I‚Äôll be writing for 30 minutes if I start explaining how that was a fiasco each time I did the online ordering."

Plus if my husband or one of my kids goes to the store without me then that receipt can‚Äôt be included. I think it should be set up similar to the Meijer app. You don‚Äôt have to scan your receipt or load your app, you enter the information on the keypad & you‚Äôre done.

The other one, which I use almost every time I'm in the store, is the ability to scan items in the store to check their price. If you haven't already, I would check it out."

I also hate it that most of the time when I am there the line with the cashier is not open. Twice when I have asked for them to open it they have said no and the other time they opened it but it was an obvious inconvenience to the cashier. Employees have offered to help me at the self-check lines but it is crowded, slow, stressful and twice I was overcharged because the employee scanned my items multiple times. I do not mind to use a self-check out line when I have only a few items but when I have a basket full of groceries after a long day at work I appreciate the help of a cashier.

I was able to get exactly what I wanted in the finish I wanted with 128gb. It cost me less than $100 because I used my Savings Catcher credits. With the ease of the app, it sure pays off to take a few minutes to scan my receipts. Thank you Walmart!"
234,Jahhjah bless,"July 23, 2018",4,Needs adjustments This is a good app but it needs a few adjustments. Two in particular are scanning and prices. Sometimes when I‚Äôm in store and I need a price check I‚Äôll scan put sometimes on the app it‚Äôll say this item isn‚Äôt in inventory and won‚Äôt price. And with the prices sometimes I like to plan out what I‚Äôm going to go to the store and buy but items that are only sold in stores don‚Äôt show a price. I think that even if they are only sold in stores you should still incorporate a price so people can have an idea or range of how much they might spend for that product.

Wanted to try the new pick up option and get the necessities, why do I have to wait 5 days to pick up 6 items. Some are ready in 2 days, then 3 and the remainder in 5. I was prepared to wait until next day. These are stock items. I called my daughter and she was able to go grab them all tonight. I thought the pick up option was for convenience, waiting almost a week for the order is far from convenient."

In practice when you are in the store you don‚Äôt have enough signal to use the app either on your cellular data or the store WiFi. So you have to go inside and outside every time you want to pick up a prescription or plan ahead and only get one at a time. Then if there is an error you have to wait in the main line. My advice forget skipping the line because it doesn‚Äôt work and just proceed to the main line to save time.

Or a delete button so the patient can remove it themselves along with an alert saying are you sure you want to proceed with deleting this prescription? Thanks!

No matter how much money you spend they never seem to be able to find a lower price at any of the other stores nearby, so  they don't have to bother giving you the difference on a gift card.

It was a very intriguing program that legitimately caused me to scan receipts and I routinely received back small amounts that added up over time. Walmart has yet again decided to forsake its loyal customers by forcing their ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE Walmart pay as the only redemption method. I refuse to provide my credit card number to an app for security reasons and thus this program is useless to me (as it will be for a huge number of the people who actually used it). At the end of the day, I am sure that this was this greedy corporation‚Äôs goal to begin with but I will be moving to another store from now on and they will be losing my large amount of business."
365,Cluedo Man,"September 8, 2018",3,Great! But needs work The prices that the app display don‚Äôt match what‚Äôs in the store. Example Dr. Pepper in the store costs $4.43 for a 12 pack but the app says it‚Äôs $7.56 for a 12 pack. What's the correct price? Savings catcher works sometimes and then sometimes not. It reports savings found but doesn‚Äôt say what items you saved on or you scan in a receipt and 1 to 1.5 weeks go by and it doesn‚Äôt show that it‚Äôs doing anything. The app does a good job helping locate products in the store and when products don‚Äôt look like they are the right price the barcode scanner is very handy.
366,CasJune95,"September 20, 2018",3,Savings Catcher I like the app especially the Savings Catcher but I hate the fact they‚Äôre changing it so you can‚Äôt scan receipts anymore which is stupid. It would be better if they just added the option where you can use Walmart Pay for Savings Catcher and not replace scanning receipts because I never use Walmart Pay and sometimes I‚Äôm not the one who goes to the store. So when they change it I won‚Äôt be able to use Savings Catcher anymore. So I really hope they change it to using Walmart Pay as another option and not it being the only way.

I tried everything, restarting my phone, reopening the app, uninstalling the app, and so on. I was still trying 30 minutes later, but then it said that they were sold out.

Your taking away another chance for us to catch savings, cause we have to connect. And not everyone has time to do that. Esp if you have kids, lots of errands to run, etc. I am a mother of 3...with them yelling at me, messing around, etc I don‚Äôt remember to connect at the register. Again, VERY disappointed!!!"

I hope you are paying the developers and engineers well. This is a very hefty app. The app actually makes shopping in the store easier."

Walmart now decided, for some reason, to discontinue savings catcher for cash purchases. So there is no longer any point in entering receipts.  Only purchases made with Walmart Pay can count but why on earth would someone increase personal risk by doing something that stupid?  And yes this move probably is another strategy in Walmart's rumored war on working-class people.

Now I will be more inclined to go to other grocery stores in addition to get the lower price. I do like the app, the fact that I can check a price or locate where they stock what I'm shopping for but this is a huge disappointment for me because the money that accumulates on my savings catcher was always my grocery money on vacation. They are a multi-billion dollar business already but it's never enough for them, is it?"

And yes, I make sure I‚Äôm at the correct store. If this happened occasionally I wouldn‚Äôt say anything but it seems to happen more often then not.

That makes the wishlists you have painstakingly curated for each room; personal purpose, COMPLETELY MOOT.

Stole money out of my account not returned it as they said they will do not trust this app I been using it since 2011 I have nothing but problems with it.

I pull out the exact same card I have stored in Walmart pay and run it though the refrained and it‚Äôs approved.

For example, lint rollers seem like they would be near laundry products or at the very least near pet supplies. Instead, they are way across the store by hangers. Also, it is ridiculous to see lines of people waiting to check out, when there are several registers not being utilized. Sure, I can use self check but I shouldn‚Äôt have to. I believe that the cost of the cashiers are included in the price of your products. Then if you do self check, you should get a discount, since I am doing the work of the cashier."

418,Twisted30,"February 27, 2020",1,"Walmart Pay is terrible! First problem is that every time they update the app, the move Walmart Pay.  It should be easily accessible, but it‚Äôs not.  When you start the app in the store, it comes up with a pop-up that prevents you from accessing Walmart Pay until it goes away.  Then, the app keeps changing your payment options!  I got the Capital One Walmart Card to use on the app and it worked fine at first.  Then, the app switched my payment back to my bank account...  and it doesn‚Äôt even tell you!!!!  I made several purchases thinking it was charging to one account and it was charging to another!!  Horrible experience!!!!"

I know they have other companies that sell through the app but it‚Äôs too much of an overload to find what I want. The filters are not helpful and sometimes when I ‚Äúapply‚Äù the filter it doesn‚Äôt actually work. Also, the filters are pretty general to most items and I feel like it needs to be more specific categories.  For example when I was looking for a specific color of shirt the filters did not have sleeve length and there are thousands of items to scroll through. I wish it were more user friendly like Targets app."

I believe this was set up because Walmart was losing money on savings catcher because they do NOT have the cheapest  prices like they claim and less people will use this way. I loved the savings catcher feature before and was able to use the savings to buy Christmas gifts for my large family which was nice when money is tight during the holidays."

Say, a million users gat back a dollar on savings, that is a million dollars they are giving away to users. What would you do? Logically speaking, i would do the same. But, at the same time, I am dropping the savings part of it and using Ibotta. It‚Äôs not as easy as Walmart pay used to be , but at least I get to save money."

Our Walmart‚Äôs just always have way to much attitude and this digital age with hacking is not trustworthy for me to be linking my card. Plus, I rarely get anything back anymore.

Needless to say I do most of my grocery shopping at Winco!"

Did it work?? Of course not. Why should you have to click submit receipt for it to go under savings catcher? Who ever made the changes to this app isn't the brightest crayon in the box.

I buy $200 worth of groceries each week through online pick-up. This new change gives me no way to process the receipt. Even if I do shop in the store, the credits given must be used immediately so getting a dollar or two off your bill doesn‚Äôt feel like much of a reward.

A person is potentially exposed to COVID-19 EVERY TIME they go in the store, to leave empty handed when the app says the items are in store.

Now they took away the savings catcher altogether. All of this happened in the span of one year. It was all just a ploy to get you to use their app. There‚Äôs absolutely NO reason to use Walmart Pay now. The app is not secure and you get no additional savings. Such a disappointment."

674,Soulsummer,"September 20, 2018",1,New Savings Catcher Terms.. What the heck! Why are you taking away the option to scan receipts??? I HAVE to use a combination of cash and or cards when I shop. Not everyone wants to store their cards on their phones to shop with either. I have to save paper receipts when I shop for disabled clients. They need them for their spending ledgers. You are taking this away as they rely on the extra savings for other needs with the savings catcher. You are also punishing everyone else that shops with cash. It wasn‚Äôt inconvenient at all to scan receipts!

727,AngelaMarieMartinez,"October 30, 2018",1,"New update Why change the way I can scan my receipts to savings catcher? You can only pay using credit/debit cards now and not cash? This was a stupid idea to change this. How do I use my savings money when all it shows is to scan receipts and just pay with my card? I have no use for this app now. It was awesome the way it was before. Why change something that worked good for everyone? I guarantee it won‚Äôt even work now either. Again, such a stupid idea to change this app. I don‚Äôt even want to give this app one star. Thumbs down. Boo boooo."

732,Gameplaygame,"November 28, 2018",2,Walmart pay update I have been using the Walmart app for a few years. Savings catcher was very beneficial. It encouraged me to shop at Walmart more.  Since the last update of being made to only use Walmart pay for savings catcher I no longer want shop at Walmart. I have chosen not use Walmart pay for personal and security reasons. Not all shoppers are able to use Walmart pay. Being able to use savings catcher to manually upload receipts is more convenient. Please bring back manual upload.

However I gave 2 stars because it took me 5 times to place my order due to the app glitching and closing out. Luckily it didn‚Äôt charge me 5 times. I understand there‚Äôs probably a lot of people using the app. An update to prevent the glitches would be a must. I will still continue to use. I didn‚Äôt have that problem with just the grocery app. Once this get fixed my rating would be 5 stars.

I went back in the app and it would let me add the very same items it was telling me were unavailable at checkout.  Such a frustrating experience."

The Walmart in Ammon, Idaho is notorious for lines going down the center aisle, but they have chosen not to use the express lane. This leaves everyone with the app at their mercy. The fact that Walmart corporate says that each store can choose to use or not says a lot about their concern on whether the app is used or not. I would suggest calling your local store and see if they care enough about customer service to use this option. Mine sure doesn‚Äôt!!"

That‚Äôs definitely a disappointment and has made me stop using the app as well as not shopping at there store as often. Also on their website it states that you can still access savings catcher through ‚Äúservices‚Äù on the app. But that is not true. Very disappointed and hope that they‚Äôll change it back.

748,Nickjdunn,"October 29, 2018",1,Removed Ability To Scan Receipts So I just noticed they removed the ability to scan your Walmart receipts into the app for savings catcher or to keep record of your receipts digitally unless you pay with Walmart pay.  That‚Äôs a really stupid move because I don‚Äôt shop with Walmart pay but still want to have a record of my receipts and use the savings catcher.  Once again Walmart finds a way to make it inconvenient on the customer.  I usually go out of my way to shop at Walmart but it seems like they care less and less about the customer.

753,GG's World,"November 15, 2018",1,I hate the new Savings catcher Who has time in the store to pull out your phone to do the Walmart pay scan?  Most of the time there are long lines and you just want to get your groceries and go. Now you want to make the lines longer by have someone pull out their phone and scan something. This is crazy. The line are normally 20 people in 3 or 4 registers. Even in self checkout.  I just moved to a new community and the store starts closing procedures at 7pm for a 12 am closing. They close self checkout at 8pm which makes the lines even longer.

I would like to see you bring the receipt upload back so that users have a choice for how they enter their shopping receipts. I have been reading the reviews and see that many of your long time users of the app seem to be unhappy with the new updates you‚Äôve made.  Please listen to your users and bring it back.

Today I was told that this is happening to several different people and they can‚Äôt get a hold of corporate to inquire why refunds aren‚Äôt going through. Stay away from Walmart. They can surely take the money out of your account rather quickly but getting it returned is a hassle.
758,smalls1004,"November 9, 2019",1,Skip the line returns There is no point for the skip the line return on the app. I got told multiple times by the store to get in the regular line to use the ‚Äúskip the line ‚Äú feature for returns. I haven‚Äôt even attempted the one for the pharmacy. They also won‚Äôt price match things sold by Walmart at the Walmart store. I can see if it‚Äôs sold by another company on the website but when it‚Äôs Walmart‚Äôs own stuff it‚Äôs really crazy they won‚Äôt match their own price in the store. I am choosing more and more to go to target because of Walmart‚Äôs customer service.
759,ScottyDR,"June 24, 2019",5,"Good App Overall I like the app it is very useful and I use it quite often. One thing I wish would be added is the scan barcode in the 3D Touch, so that you don‚Äôt have to open the app first to start scanning for a price or product info. That would make the app even more convenient."
760,JohnnyDisMe,"October 5, 2017",2,"Could be much better Your price matching feature usually comes back with a message saying that none of the items purchased could be found or qualify for the feature which is completely errant.

Please do some more work on your app. Thanks."
761,jbug1976,"October 20, 2017",3,Credit card section I think the bigger drawback to the app is the credit card section it doesn't exist either there needs to be a section added or a whole entirely new app dedicated to because using the mobile website barely works for that portion of the website it just a broken link most of the time???!!!

It‚Äôs not automatically captured and I don‚Äôt have a printed receipt to enter the requested info. Kinda ridiculous."
763,AnoarB,"February 27, 2018",1,Horrible scam. Avoid!! The App used to scan receipts but they updated it and it does not scan them anymore no matter how many times you try. So you have to manually enter it and even then it doesn‚Äôt work sometimes. Obviously this is to get people to avoid entering receipts for the so called savings catcher that they advertise or for possible returns making it harder to enter a receipt so many people don‚Äôt have the time to do it. The bean counters at WalMart are obviously in charge of the scam of an App. If I had time I‚Äôd report them to whatever government agency regulated them.
764,keljyou,"June 17, 2018",4,"Stocking issues I love Oregon, Ohio Walmart. I go there 2-3 times a week. But I get frustrated sometimes because it always seems like they are out of stock on things most of the time.

Other than that, I love my store."

I assume this is not a bug and was a decision made by Walmart corporate to fatten their wallets. I see a ton of negative feedback after this change.

795,A. Hall0221,"November 4, 2018",1,Savings Catcher Inconvenient I have been using savings catcher for years. This new update that now requires me to use my Walmart pay in order to submit a receipt is TERRIBLE. I will be deleting this app and no longer using it once my last receipts have been finalized. It‚Äôs no longer convenient for me. I do not wish to have my debit card attached and it‚Äôs too much of a hassle to add a gift card EVERY time I‚Äôm in Walmart (which is pretty much daily). What purpose does this serve for customers? Even the cashiers are confused and not sure how it works now.

Which was incorrect - the bag didn‚Äôt look like a tote bag OR had the word in the name. Fix ASAP please."

864,strxwberryghost,"November 1, 2018",3,Disappointed I‚Äôm kind of disappointed Walmart has decided to take scanning receipts away from savings catcher. Not everyone has a debit card or gift card etc. to pay with. I‚Äôm going to do my best to continue using the app but from now on I‚Äôd actually have to go into the store and buy what I‚Äôd like which causes me time I could be doing something else. Anyway having that ability was fun while it lasted...
865,RLWEEMS81,"November 1, 2018",1,Savings going down the drain Once a happy saver with the savings catcher. The recent switch to Walmart Pay requires a hold up in the line or you have to remind yourself to have your app ready to scan before starting your transaction. This has been an issue the last 3 out of 4 visits to the store. Not being able to scan your receipt after the transaction will continue to cause a loss of savings and that will drive me to other means of saving. Savings Catcher was a hit but why take a working system away?

867,DianeShopaholic,"February 19, 2019",1,Savings Catcher is a joke! I live very close to the local store. I thought the savings catcher was a cool idea. Eventually we were forced to give Walmart our credit card information to use it. They limit you to submitting only 7 receipts a week. If you shop more than that it‚Äôs like you are penalized for spending money there. Many times I‚Äôve had to visit 2 Walmart‚Äôs in one day because of out of stock items. You would think they wouldn‚Äôt limit the receipt submitted if they truly appreciated the extra business!

In every time. Annoying but ok. Next it makes me enter some information on a card I have on the app. And it‚Äôs been asking that every time now. It didn‚Äôt use to do that. And very annoyed. Please fix...

In the beginning, it was worth the effort to scan the receipt. Not any more.  Very seldom do I get any money back even when I know there are stores in the area with lower prices. I guess it was costing Walmart too much. I won‚Äôt be wasting my time with the Savings Catcher anymore. There are several other apps out there that offer a better cost savings."

1087,yapoujian,"July 7, 2018",1,Savings catcher Your online savings catcher hardly ever scans. You have to key it in and even then it doesn‚Äôt work right. When you use your Walmart credit card they tell you in scans it in automatically no need to anything . That is not the case after making several large over $100 shopping trips . I found out you have to accept it and then it sends. Which is opposite of what I was told. So I lost out on several receipts that I‚Äôm sure would of have some adjustments.

You people are theives. Savings catcher didn‚Äôt exactly level the playing field, but the app gave the customer a genius rationale for shopping primarily at WalMart. Not anymore.

Walmart took a great thing and ruined it by putting their greed in front of consumer savings.

I usually scan receipts all year then come Christmas time I use that to help with buying presents... y‚Äôall should seriously rethink this because Walmart will lose a lot of business over this.. savings catcher was really awesome and y‚Äôall had to go a mess that up... I really wish y‚Äôall would bring it back..
1226,Brenis,"November 21, 2018",1,Savings Catcher The app is NOT working properly. I‚Äôm not able to submit my receipts. I see a message that you have to use Walmart pay to add the receipts but is not working at all has been one month and Walmart don‚Äôt do anything to fix the problem. It‚Äôs very frustrating trying to get someone to help you. This is the worse customer service that I have ever received from a store. Communication is horrible and the lack of service is completely unacceptable.
1227,Devogirl,"December 9, 2018",1,Don‚Äôt buy anything from a 3rd party Through Walmart because if you try to return it in store you have to have a box and if they can‚Äôt print the label for you they will send you away and put your order through as you returned it at the store when you didn‚Äôt. And when you call customer support for help to reverse it they tell you you have to go back to the store. Big waste of time. Just buy at Walmart in the store or don‚Äôt buy at all

1246,Tess514514,"June 8, 2018",1,A gimmick I have found savings catcher to be a bit of a joke.

1466,CarNana,"November 23, 2018",1,Up set You can no longer scan Your recipe. This is not good. It was one of the few things going for WalMart. They don‚Äôt sales. Have cut the merchandise in half. I can‚Äôt find half of products they use to carry. All the other grocery stores run ads every week. Give you points to get 10. A gallon off. WalMart now has taken the one savings away. And you have lost this customer for good. Brookshire‚Äôs and Kroger has won me over.

Thank you Sandy

Huge decline - it doesn‚Äôt feel as customer oriented anymore."
1485,walmart used to be good,"June 7, 2018",1,Savings catcher Savings catcher is not worth a flip. I have been scanning my receipts and I know the item is on sale at the local grocery store. Walmart comes back and says no lower prices were found.  I called Walmart about it and they said oh yes we see where it‚Äôs on sale and we will put your money on your savings catcher.  They never did. If you are not going to do what you say just stop everything altogether. Your word is not worth anything.

In theory it's awesome but not so much in my reality.
1489,Zippy Jack,"June 17, 2018",3,Mrs. Walmart is no longer one stop shopping. They have discontinued or are out of inventory of many many items. Cashiers ask if I found everything I was looking for.

Now I‚Äôm able to do all my shopping at one place - Walmart & only Walmart. I‚Äôm able to do so because if the item I purchased happens to be on sale elsewhere, Walmart will reimburse me the difference on an e-gift card. It allows you to pay with your cellphone, at checkout, via Walmart Pay. Even though it‚Äôs not given back to me in actual cash, I have no problems spending money on a gift card. I‚Äôm now able to utilize all the local sales ads at one location, cut my shopping day in half, as well as pocket my gas money I would‚Äôve used traveling from store to store. Even though so far I‚Äôve been mostly pleased with the Savings Catcher feature, there are a few negative points I‚Äôd like to mention. One major problem is the majority of the Walmart employees have no idea how it works. I find myself educating most of the cashiers at the checkout counter. I‚Äôm not sure if this has been fixed or not but the last time I tried getting gas and attempted to pay via my e-gift card (Walmart Pay), it would not allow me to do so. The only way I could use my funds for gas was to transfer funds from my Walmart Pay Account to a handheld gift card then pay for the gas that way. I sure hope Walmart does something about this because I personally wouldn‚Äôt use Savings Catcher and Walmart Pay if I‚Äôm not able to use my reimbursement money on anything I wanted."
