0,OMG101,"March 30, 2020",3,"Please fix notifications Instagram please PLEASE. What will it take for me to stop getting notifications (specifically insta live notifications) for people I either don’t follow, or don’t care about when they go live and to get the ones I DO care about. I even have all have notifications turned for this couple few I don’t care and ALL the ones I do care for ON. I have notifications on for a reason and when I get a notifications TWO HOURS LATE it’s defeats the purpose. Especially when a certain person I follow has a tendency to delete stuff. This has been a problem for a while now and I didn’t really have exact proof but now the notifications aren’t even showing up in my Notification Center. It’s also very sporadic which ones I do and don’t get. I depend on the app to deliver me the services it says it can deliver but now it’s falling flat. I would HUGELY appreciate it if you could make the * added to their story and *started a live video notifications show up in the activity center like IGTV live. It’s also not just me. People I follow on twitter (who are in the same fandom) have also been complaining about this a lot. It would be really nice not having to be anxious about missing a post or a live or story cause and then having to check multiple times throughout the day especially those who have completely different time zones then the person they are following. Otherwise there isn’t any other major problems."
1,Wicked Dark,"April 12, 2020",4,"Innovative app, yet the devil is in the details. This app is quite, or rather, has become quite formative as it is truly a varied multimedia platform where many people can connect, and even create careers. It also has a lot of fun features from other social media platforms such as “live” and “stories.” That being said, with this little bells and whistles it’s merely the minor things that make it just slightly annoying to utilize. For instance, posting a song on your story for the maximum time frame of 15 seconds. I understand the need for a time limit due to copyright laws and basic business structure, yet when you add a gif to the post, the song plays for a significantly reduced time. That slightly annoying quirk just ruined tedious work to pick the perfect 15 seconds you’re confined to. To add, the gif selection is also quite small which is disappointing, and surprising. This app is (as stated earlier) a “multimedia platform,” merely create a space where instagram artists can display their digital design talent by posting gifs and encourage the community to vote on favorites to increase artist recognition. Don’t sell yourselves short, people want apps that grow and expand with new features. Yet, you can’t halfass features and never provide any upkeep. It’s additional labor but you’re creating a bigger brand with additional opportunities to involve your community."
2,Timelord7,"October 10, 2018",3,"Use Less Data NOT WORKING I normally wouldn’t be doing this, I need to say this right now. Instagram, you have a great app, a good look, etc. The one problem I have with you is that I can’t stop videos from playing automatically. The one feature you have when it comes to your website on a desktop or laptop, you don’t have it on your mobile versions; I’m disappointed. I try to go and stop this from happening when I use cellular instead of WiFi and it turns out that the video still plays automatically. Why? I lose more data when the video plays automatically let alone even loading the thumbnail of a video. The “Use Less Data” feature doesn’t work, at all. About a few versions ago or at least back in August or early September, the feature worked and I didn’t really need to be that concerned. But I can’t use a feature that won’t work. I have tried everything, turning on and off my phone, updated the app, and even deleted it and reinstalled it. I tried googling why it won’t work but there wasn’t any result that showed how to fix this stupid problem. I’m pretty sure there were other people that were experienced this because googling a topic and having shown something in the search bar as a top result shows that people have been googling a specific topic. But no result. So please can you fix this because this is a problem I’m not going to deal with anymore."
3,sucky app claims,"April 19, 2020",4,"Submitting a problem in the app, no one ever answers So basically I’ve never had a problem with instagram, i love the app but on occasions i get completely removed the option to share others posts to my instagram story. Ive seen others have the problem as well and as of right now I've been going on for 4 months now repeatedly reporting this error and still getting no response and no fix. There is no way for me to fix it by myself, I’ve gone threw all my settings, deleted the app and reinstalled, signed in and out but yet nothing works. Its a problem the developer or whoever controls fixing updates or bugs needs to look into because it is quite irritating that i am not given this option but some others aren’t. Ive noticed one my main account I'm not allowed the option to share posts to my story but yet on my art account i am given the ability to do so as well. Its quite interesting how they cut it off for only some accounts for on going months. This isn’t the first time this has happened to me either so ive had to sit for months on months with this problem only waiting for the right update to fix it. All im asking is to please fix this issue, i dont know any other way to reach out so this is my last time, I’m tired of reporting this issue through the app and getting no response whatsoever."
4,isabellatriesart,"May 12, 2018",3,"Filtering I’ve never had that big of a problem with Instagram. The algorithm has been a bit annoying but it’s nothing that has ever physically annoyed me. But I just saw the update for “filtering out any bullying comments”. First of all, I agree with the whole message of not bullying children or harassment of children online. That’s not ok. However, filtering out comments involving bullying and such doesn’t make sense due to the fact that half of the time people are just joking. Secondly, you are restricting people’s rights to speak their minds. This site/app should be a place where people should be allowed to say and post whatever they please, regardless of whether it’s right or wrong. There are of course boundaries but it is very difficult to set those boundaries online. I feel like restricting “bullying” comments will just cause more problems within the instagram community. Because there is no way to tell a person’s real intentions on whatever they say online. You just can’t. It’s near impossible. Restricting someone’s thoughts on an app/site is not a way to stop online bullying or harassment. I understand that cyber bullying is very wrong and very uncalled for, however restricting any comments involving the context “bullying” isn’t going to solve a lot. There are other ways to prevent/promote non-bullying behavior on websites. Filtering out comments is not a way to go about the situation."
5,User10019,"January 22, 2020",3,"Help!!! I appreciate the quick responses and corrections for the issues I’ve had. Thank you. I’m very new to the business side of Insta, so I’m not very fluent in the algorithms and how they work. I don’t quite understand how to obtain followers.  I don’t like that my profile seems to be categorized with other dog stores which is pointless, because other stores aren’t potential customers.  My profile keeps getting tagged with inappropriate pictures, since my profile is linked to the website they upload there too. I’ve changed my settings to prevent that now but somehow they are still there in the background as if they are used to place my profile into a spam server or something, idk.  It seems like posts don’t circulate unless you pay, especially on Facebook.  Plus paying only gets you false likes, the analytics show down to the millisecond how much time was spent on the site, what page, what products etc.  I feel like the clicks are computer generated and aren’t real potential customers.  My profile lost 100 followers overnight it seems and now for every follower I get I lose the same number.  Although I appreciate the followers I do have, it seems they are from countries in which I don’t sell products, so again pointless.  How do I generate followers? How do I prevent the inappropriate tagging? How do I keep my profile from being spammed? What am I missing?"
6,Agoldgamer,"April 9, 2019",1,"Unusable? Alright, so to start my story, I wanted to get insta to talk to my girlfriend who lives further away and can’t talk to me as often as we’d like. As soon as I install the app, I quickly go and make an account, but as soon as I’m finishing up it says my account has been deactivated before I even sign up for one. When I try to report the problem it says Error and asks me to make sure I’m connected to the internet before trying again. I tried making an account 5 times and each time it kept saying the same thing. I know I have internet access to begin with so I should be able to report the problem that shouldn’t even be occurring. "
7,Amelia Is Me👑,"June 2, 2019",3,"I need help! So I have a problem. I’m trying to make a new account, but it won’t let me. I really like this app and I want to keep using. My problem is when I want to sign up a signup Error message pops up and it says "
8,G. Anne J.,"June 12, 2018",3,"All we want is chronological order! I love this app so much. I use it every single day, and use it to keep in contact with my friends. It is very easy to post things, direct messages work well, and stories are a neat feature even if it wasn’t an original idea."
9,Archer189,"September 10, 2019",1,"Had my account was shut down for no reason I finally decided to get on instagram after my friends would not stop asking me to get on. And it was not a good experience, why because my account was shut down before even seeing the home page or whatever the first thing you see when the app is open. Now I’ll will tell you exactly what I did. I went to my App Store downloaded instagram next I clicked create new account, I entered my email address and chose my password then click next, the next window "
10,vlpage,"November 10, 2017",3,"Still good, not great (iPhone X) I have pretty much the same comments as everyone else, regarding bringing back chronological order of the feed, stories being a ripoff of Snapchat (but I believe Facebook, instagram, and Snapchat are all owned by the same company if I’m not mistaken), etc. BUT ALSO, I just bought an iPhone X and the app needs some serious revamping be compatible with the new phone. They did a good job of having the layout fill the full screen view of the X; HOWEVER, when you go to upload a new profile photo, if you click on any photo besides the very most recent one in your photo album, the layout glitches, and the “Cancel” and “Done” buttons move up on top of the iPhone’s time and battery displays. I wish I could attach a photo to this review, but I hope my explanation makes sense. This glitch makes it impossible to click either of the buttons, and you have to physically kill the app and reopen it in order to get out of the screen and back to using the app. This happens every time you try to change the profile photo. If you use the most recent photo in your album, it works mostly fine, with just a little awkward cropping on top. This is just frustrating because obviously people might want to be able to upload ANY of their pictures as a profile photo! This glitch really needs to be worked out ASAP"
11,Poor people love Jesus,"January 19, 2018",2,Instagram discriminated against who can post what in the comments. I was just on an NFL post about the Jaguars defensive stats having a plain old argument that even though the Steele’s lost that doesn’t make the Jags a better team... that has nothing to do with my problem. The problem is I typed a response to a commenter during the argument of which I was blocked from posting saying that Instagram keeps certain “guidelines” for the community... some generic message I’d expect if i was trying to say something racist or sexist. But no. It was a simple argument about football that I was blocked from expressing my opinion on because it didn’t follow “guidelines”. The comment had no vulgar language and presented my argument in such a way that there was no degrading or demeaning connotation toward the would be recipient. TAKE NOTE: This comment was made on an NFL post and I was blocked from posting my opinion AGAINST the team the post was promoting.  This is not a singular or first occurrence as I’ve had this problem before with Instagram blocking me from posting comments that oppose the view(s) expresses within the correlating post.  I quite frankly find this ridiculous amongst the sea of comments I read through on posts from news publications such as Fox.  As long as you don’t disagree with the post you can same just about anything that isn’t immediately racist or sexist... but I can’t argue about football.  Fix this.
12,falloutjane,"January 20, 2018",5,"Algorithm I’ve been an Instagram user for a long time now and I really enjoy the app. Definitely my favorite social media platform. I, unlike most, really like Instagram stories and I love how you can save stuff without having to screenshot. My complaint however is my home feed. I’m tired of only seeing posts from 5 of the 200 people I follow. I wish there was a way to have it be in chronological order, but you can make it so that specific people do show up at the top of your feed. This may sound a little silly but it’s pretty embarrassing when you accidentally like and comment on a post from 5 days ago as if it was posted ten minutes ago. Really I don’t understand why Instagram is making all these frankly useless updates to the algorithm. Instead of that they should be cracking down on how the thumbnail (starter photo?) for a video has nothing to do with the video. Now that’s something that needs worked on. I feel that these algorithm changes only benefit the people exploiting Instagram and hurts regular users content intake. This is a little long so in short great app but please stop messing with my feed, or at least give me the option to change it back to the way it was if I so please."
13,Raw.Deen,"January 25, 2018",2,"PLEASE TAKE AWAY THE ALGORITHM Truthfully, at this point I think that Instagram is being bought out by bigger companies/influencers to keep this algorithm in place. It doesn’t take more than 5 minutes of scrolling through Twitter or Facebook to see that THE PEOPLE WANT THEIR FEED IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER (At the very least, let me have the liberty of choice). This “update” truly is screwing people over. Truthfully it makes me not wanna use Instagram. I FOLLOW 700 PEOPLE. Why am I only seeing content from 8 of them? It’s ridiculous. I scroll down my feed to see other people I’m following and all I see is posts from THE SAME PEOPLE. I’m on Instagram EVERYDAY. I’ve seen DJ Akademiks posts for each one of the past 5 days, there is NO reason I should scroll past 4 pictures TODAY and STILL be seeing Akademiks from 5 days ago. It’s not right and it’s taking a lot away from the app. Instagram is a 5 star app, the stories were a great addition, the promotion feature isn’t bad, the discover feed is cool, BUT THIS ALGORITHM STUFF HAS TO STOP! & then you say that “oh it’s based on what you’d like to see” ....... well if all that’s on my feed for the past week is Akademiks, I guess I’m gonna watch a couple videos...... You follow someone and it immediately force feeds you their past 5 posts and that’s not cool. PLEASE MAKE INSTAGRAM CHRONOLOGICAL AGAIN! There will be more content for all to see and it will strengthen interactions among instagrammers. This is ridiculous."
14,Te rates,"July 26, 2018",4,"Great app, feed flaws. Overall, Instagram is an excellent social media app. However, I have found a few flaws in the way Instagram looks. For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages. You can always see if someone has seen your direct message. This isn't exactly a problem, but I think there should be an option, in case someone does not want people to know when they have seen their messages. Please take these suggestions into consideration. I know I am not the only person complaining about these things. Other than those problems, I have only had good experiences with Instagram. It is very easy and fun to use. You can share pictures and videos with your community or even the world! All in all, Instagram is a fantastic app, but needs a few fixes."
15,Put it back!:(,"September 12, 2018",5,"SUGGESTION! How about an Option For Chronological order? So I seriously like this app and following creators but I have a problem with how my feed is always set up. First of all, my feed is not in chronological order! The way it’s set up is very very unnecessary, I miss many posts from the accounts I follow! I also end up seeing posts from the second they upload a photo to the next post being from another person from 5 days ago! Second, since the way our feed is set up it keeps changing the posts every single time I come back to the app, again with the same thing, a post from 5 days ago to like 3 minutes ago. Like you’re lucky to catch one that’s very recent. That’s just so uncomfortable and very annoying. Please bring back chronological order or have an option for this!!(I seriously believe having an option is perfect!! It gives us a choice!!) It’s more helpful than accidentally missing a post because the way this is set up. Or completely miss a whole week of posts by someone. Anyways We have been trying to ask you guys for so long now! It’s certainly something we need back."
16,lit_lana,"February 5, 2019",1,"Is instagram deleting people for doing nothing? Overall I love the app instagram, you can see funny videos and even gain followers on there, but here is the biggest problem on instagram, THEY ARE DELETING ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOTHING WRONG. Instagram needs to get out of their brain dead state and start checking accounts before deleting them because they are getting reported and accounts are being banned and disabled. This is especially unfair to the fan editors out there. There are hundreds of thousands of people who make edits of their favorite people on apps such as TikTok, Instagram, etc. These fans work hard on their edits, tag the people they edited, try to make their day by showing how much they love them just so instagram can delete the photos and videos because they assume that they are trying to be them??? Clearly if you read the caption you can clearly see that they are just simply showing how much they love that user. They are not trying to be like them they are just trying to support them. If they think people who show love to who they support then why don’t hate pages get banned, reported, or disabled? This isn’t the only people instagram has done this to because a nice dancer who did absolutely nothing wrong got disabled at 300k, the followers she worked hard on getting!!! Instagram needs to step up their game and stop doing all this bad stuff to these people who show their support or I’ll just have to be one of the many people who delete this app."
17,Suhfefadhkkfdgkkcex,"March 13, 2019",1,"I was ok with it at first but then this happened... So I went to go on my art account right. I go to check my activity and it says “we’re having trouble accessing your activity” and I was like ok maybe I need to refresh it. I did and nothing changed. So then I say ok I’m just going to post another piece of artwork when I go to post it, it wouldn’t post. I also tried refreshing it. It didn’t post. Eventually I was like ok maybe it’s my email. I went to go confirm my email and bam! Could not confirm my email I retried over and over again and nothing changed. I even tried turning my phone off and back on again even though I just got this iPhone 8 in December! When I tried it again after restarting my phone, it still didn’t work. So eventually I was like ok you know what, let me just log out and log back in. "
18,DaintlyDelilah,"May 12, 2019",1,"Oh Instagram. Honestly. If you would’ve asked me a little over a week ago I would’ve said, “ I love Instagram it’s the best social media app out there!” But , within this lovely week-ish. I’ve had my business account completely deleted with no explanation. Let’s add that it was AFTER I paid for a Instagram promotion and finished it. So they took my money, then deleted my account. I didn’t post anything more from the post that I put through promotion, just took the money and deleted it. And now after giving up on having my business go through Instagram I find today that I’ve also been logged out of my personal account, not deleted yet, but the account that I’ve had since I was in 6th grade. The account will not let me log in since I had an account that got blocked on this phone. So now I’m off of both business and personal accounts and being forced by Instagram to take an ig hiatus. I don’t understand why Instagram is targeting certain accounts through their apps, especially account holders that are physically paying them. So, please take a second to think about weather it’s worth it to run a business through Instagram with having the chance for it to be deleted with no exploration and no support from Instagram since none of their support outlets either connect you with someone or even work for what they say they do. Thanks for reading my annoyed ramble. I’m gonna go see if you can run a business through Twitter now."
19,*payfordata*payforads,"October 8, 2019",1,"Following activity page needs brought back. Seeing what my friends like is 80% of what I use this for. This has been my main social media, and was my favorite up until this new year. Probably moving to something else. How can people be so out of touch. You’ve slowly destroyed this app over the past few months. I’m not sure if Facebook bought you out but it sure seems like it.  This was a place you could really laugh with your friends and meet new people. But why not be snapchat? Why not be Facebook?  There popular right? This isn’t just about this recent update,  you’ve been deactivating “meme” pages for months and there’s a reason they get so many likes and followers. Because we enjoy them.  I don’t plan to be with you much longer. Maybe give us a useful function that’s not something snap already has, or just keep taking key features of your app out that’s a good course of action. Maybe if people want to hide all the “ig models” they like you can add a setting to hide just YOUR stuff from your followers “following activity”. The only logical reasoning is people want to hide what they like, give them the option to do that on there own. This seems to be in favor of the ig models, now all these new people can like because there wives/whoever won’t see. And we all lose a way of seeing things people with similar interests like.  Nobody wants to watch explore tiktoks, models, nba videos. I’m interested in more than what you feel like is “trending”"
20,Aperralll,"December 16, 2017",3,"Please stop making unnecessary changes I am finding it harder to use Instagram with every update. Changes that are being made are unnecessary and feel unnatural to me. I can’t see posts in chronological order, I have “suggestions” on the feed which I go to see ONLY what the people I’m following have been up to. That’s been slightly annoying, but now in the explore feed when I click on one post with the intention to scroll through all the posts suggested to me from various users... instead I’m met with only one users posts, most of which I’m not interested in and it’s annoying to have to go back and click the next picture to see the next meme or what-have-it, causing me to close the app and open FaceBook or Twitter instead as they aren’t making changes that are majorly affecting the way users browse content. I don’t know who instagram has put in charge of these updates, but every single update gets worse. ALSO not to mention, the app will automatically follow accounts that I have either never encountered or had no interest in following. I have never left a review in the AppStore but Instagram used to be my favorite social media outlet and now I’m much more fond of other things due to some of the updates and I think a lot of people might feel this way about the path instagram is taking."
21,--wolfg1rl--,"June 9, 2018",4,"Fix this please! I really enjoy using Instagram but I have one issue and that is that when I try to upload more than one photo into one post it crops my photos to the same size as the first one in the post. I want to be able to post all of them into one post and have all of the pictures be the original size. This would be great for photographers like me who go out on photoshoots and want to put up one post with their best photos. It is hard to do that when all of your photos are cropped the exact same way. It should be the same way as Facebook. I am not saying we make Instagram exactly like Facebook because they are two different social medias, but I think it would be nice if we could upload photos on Instagram the same way we can upload them on Facebook. With Facebook you have one post with multiple pictures that are all the original sizes. You can then click on them and look through them individually before exiting and going through the rest of your feed. Instagram should allow us to have the option to upload our photos like this. We should have an option to do this If we have a photography account. I know not everyone would want to upload their photos this way but many would choose to do this."
22,🌼Caitlyn🌼,"December 21, 2018",4,"Needs Some Improvement I’ve had Instagram since 2013, which is a very long time 😂 It’s definitely changed over the years. A few problems I’m facing now, however, include my explore page resetting (I’d have to exit the app & go back in to fix that), and not having sound when I try to upload a video on an extra account."
23,Gooey penguin30053,"December 28, 2018",1,"I cannot recommend this app Instagram is a terrible social media platform with a horrible community with horrible bugs and only makes itself worse. I cannot recommend this app to anyone. I would delete this app in a heartbeat if I didn't talk to so many people on this app. The app tries reinventing itself and only makes itself worse by doing so. The app chooses the remake things that work perfectly on the app and make it over complicated instead of fixing actual infuriating bugs in the app. If you leave the app halfway through a text, the part of the text will show up in the chat every time you open up that conversation for a day or two until it stops for no reason at all. The app also chooses to implement other features that don't need to be added like changes to the profile page and making it more likely to mis-tap and hit a story button when trying to go back from messages than before. It chooses to implement these kinds of features instead of ones I, personally would really like like a feature to read all story's or better privacy. It also infuriates me that they have not chosen to make and iPad app yet. They know they don't need to make this app better because many people have no choice but to use it, like me. Do not get this app and save yourself your own time and brain power trying to understand what they were thinking doing some of the things they do with this app."
24,uzer001098876,"January 1, 2019",4,"A sad user My Instagram feed is now filled with posts from advertisers and accounts of which I don’t even follow. I never see my friends on my feed anymore unless I am scrolling for 10 minutes and people’s pictures are not getting as many likes. I can speak from experience because I have watched my likes go down as Instagram has changed their algorithm. People like things which are unique! Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that. Additionally, make the feed tendered to followers which a users look at most frequently."
25,_Lil JAJA_,"January 17, 2019",2,"“Instagram needs a customer service number” SECURITY & SAFTEY OF PERSONAL LIVES ! Instagram has been a great app ever since I was around 10 to 11 years old I am now 17 about to be 18. I have had Instagram since 2013. However, Instagram seems as if it’s easy to hack into. My accounts have been hacked numerous times and I have tried anything/everything to try to fix this problem. I lost everything within my Instagram such as photos, saved videos, Instagram stories, my followers, my business, my followers, anything that’s within the app it’s self I have lost and I have put a lot of work into it since I was just a kid. Ever since I was kid I’ve had a dream and Instagram was my way of reaching out to the world/community especially around so I could share that dream with them (everyone has a dream). That dream feels slowed down and a bit ruined and it something I take personal to the heart with much care. I just wish whoever was doing this would stop. Instagram needs to establish a customer service app or addition to the company/service because this has not only happened to me but many others. Every time I log in my “IG” account get deleted. Please help me! If anyone supports this please help me out and tell me how to end this headache. It’s very nerve wracking knowing things like this happens to people’s account around the world. Instagram needs to be more secure! 😪 "
26,TCHALLA21,"May 10, 2019",1,"Not good I know you guys don’t read these but I’ll write this anyway. Why the feed isn’t in chronological order is beyond idiotic at this point. No one needs the espn highlights from 3 days ago at the top of the feed list. Then as a fellow developer and finance manager of a company, I know facebook inc sells data to other tech company’s so they can find “look a likes” and such to target their markets better. But you guys have made it so obvious that you are just hoarding your users data to sell to the anyone willing to pay your prices. Like if someone tags a location in playa vista California, and the very next day gets sponsored ads in their feed for Apt’s in playa vista california. Hey cool it’s a business and you guys are great at it because the idea of your product is amazing. But every time one of these algorithm based add ins are included into your development the greatness of your product deteriorates. I deleted Facebook years ago because long before your political troubles it was glaringly obvious that the spirit of your product was dead. Facebook was no longer the cool party. Instagram is doing the same thing. At least give your users the option to choose. Most wont even care if they were given a choice (yes that was a matrix reference). But when most people speak of how gross social media can be. It’s not the users or content it’s how you guys choose to display it. I hope that you all could really do better because now it’s kinda trash."
27,yallwallin,"May 15, 2019",1,Worst experience ever Made a great account and was gaining a lot of followers but only ended up having it for 6 days because Instagram banned it. I had 600 hundred followers and was averaging 100 followers gained a day. The first thing they did to my account was make it unable to comment but that was understandable I guess because I was commenting a lot. They then lifted this after one day. I started posting again and realized my hashtags didn’t work because now they shadow banned me because (and I’m guessing) they believed my account was a bot. This got me mad but my account was still thriving so I did not care. They than started deleting some of my post claiming it went against their guidelines which I read later on and saw that it didn’t.i also made a promotion with one of my vids and had no problems and the next time I tried doing it with the same vid They said it went against there ad policy. Yesterday at 9p.m I went to check how many followers I had before I went to sleep and saw that they had banned my account all together with no warnings what so ever. They didn’t give me a chance to do anything. Today I also realized every account on my phone is shadow banned and I cant create any accounts anymore so yea long story short Instagram screwed me over and is the worst social app to date. Thanks a lot
28,Blobycorn101,"July 29, 2019",4,"great app, some changes would be amazing:) Instagram is a great app that I use on a daily basis, I love it and i’ve had it multiple years, but there are some changes that would make this app go above and beyond that me, and many others, would appreciate. First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you don’t like, but you didn’t realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you don’t want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! It’s difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help."
29,nacephus,"October 17, 2019",1,"It was great and now no one sees my posts I’ve had instagram since I can honestly remember and I’ve always loved it. But recently I have started an art account and it was going smoothly the first probably 7 months until Instagram updated and now no one sees my posts. I’m not gaining followers because my posts aren’t recommended because IM NOT A BIG ACCOUNT. It honestly irks me to see how my hard work to draw and post almost every day is now basically all for nothing because everything is being handed to the bigger accounts. Smaller accounts are now butted to the side and ignored. There is almost no was of growing. I use hashtags, my story, and I posted regularly— yet my numbers still decreased with the new update. I feel like it is their way of saying “don’t promote? Don’t grow.” Sorry but not everyone is able to pay for that mess. I just wish everything was fair like it used to be. Why do big app developers always ruin something that was going so good? How can anyone else make it when they aren’t given the chances the bigger accounts once were given?"

31,Megan3133,"December 20, 2017",5,Fix in update Okay so I absolutely LOVE Instagram. Recently I have noticed it is not loading all of the posts. I will go on Facebook and see a picture posted that states it is linked with Instagram but never see it on my Instagram feed.  Also when you refresh it will take some of them completely off of the feed instead of putting them towards the bottom.  Can you please fix it! This is causing people to not get any likes at all. My followers say they never see my pictures unless they search my profile. I keep seeing the same pictures over and over again. Some days I get half of the likes I normally do because people do not see my pictures. This is very frustrating. 
32,M3owMix(-:,"October 4, 2018",3,"Not pleased Instagram is the only social media that I use. One of those reasons is because of how Amazing I find it to be. I've never had a problem occur and all the features worked perfectly until now. I logged off of my Instagram app and when I tried to log back in, it popped up ""We could not log you in"" or ""something went wrong"". When this happened I thought maybe someone had blocked me and my account had been disabled but later I found out that if that was the case they would tell you whether it is disabled or not. After a lot of failed attempts, I decided to login through Google and not use the app. I was actually able to login. So what is the problem with me logging in on the app? I even deleted and reinstalled the app, but only this time to cause myself more problems. When I reinstalled the app, I clicked on the Instagram icon and then it just crashes. I'm very displeased with what is happening. I've sent feedback but nothing seems to be changing. This was the only way that I really had contact with the outside world and being on my page allowed me to feel free and express myself. Now I can't do that and I don't know if I'll ever be able to get my account back working again. I hope that this conflict is resolved, but until then I'm giving Instagram 1 star."

It is a source for a lot of my creative inspiration and I love that aspect.  All the new tools that Instagram has incorporated into its app are so amazing and helpful. I look forward to the new features that they will one day include in the future.  One that I hope they include is the ability it add/edit postures once they have been uploaded.  This is something that I struggle with all the time, whenever I'm posting multiple pictures at a time using their sliding picture format, I cannot add onto, delete, or rearrange the order of these photos. I recently just uploaded a pair of two pictures to my page only later to realize that I forgot to add a third photo that I was planning to put.  I think it would be helpful if Instagram added an option to edit pictures in such a way that we are permitted to edit captions.  I do not wish to delete the whole post, but to simply add one more photo to my post.  Instagram please listen to this message for it will help my and several of my other friends who struggle with this same issue!"

No big deal, I’ll just log myself back in, right? Wrong. Every time I tried to log in it said an error had occurred. I logged into my Instagram through the safari app to make sure my password was correct, and it allowed me to do so. Now knowing that I was using the correct password, I tried again to log into my account through the Instagram app itself. No luck, once again. I contacted Instagram through email and they said there was nothing they could do about the problem. It is now March of 2019 and the problem is still occurring. Instagram needs to fix this situation. Which according to Google, multiple people are facing similar issues as well. Please Instagram, fix these glitches within the app or help the people who are facing these problems. This is a very irritating problem and the Instagram Team just seems to push it to the side. This is not an efficient way to run a company."

36,julie9610(:,"May 30, 2019",1,"Used to be a fan Used to be an avid Instagram user, but since the change in post order Instagram doesn’t interest me anymore. I see too many posts that are days old from the same profiles and hardly ever see the profiles I want to, I usually have to go to the users profile to see their posts. I’m also extremely disappointed in the new explore tab, there has to be millions of posts from users out there but I see the same (maybe) 100 posts repeated throughout. I refresh often and try and click as many different photos as i can, and I still end up seeing repeats more repeats than new photos. I originally liked Instagram because of the simplicity in communicating and sharing with friends, but am now realizing I’d rather learn to communicate on another app, it’s not worth being a part of Instagram anymore when it only shows me what it thinks I want to see.😕"
37,Brynn Vanoven,"November 18, 2019",1,"Um Instagram, what the hell??? 🤬 So I've had Instagram for YEARS now, and I much prefer it to Facebook or Snapchat by a long shot, but recently I've had to use both of those because Instagram won't work for me. I have four different accounts (a family account, a main art account, a writing account, and a community account) and one day after an update my main art account DMs stopped loading. At first I just assumed it was bad Internet or the update itself but when I switch to my other accounts my other DMS load just fine. I have to search up chats and stuff to find DMs and when I leave the app or account the DMs reset and I have to search them up again. I still get notifications from people who DM me and I've DMed myself but the same result everytime. And it's JUST this app. I own Instagram on my PC and my DMs for my account work just fine on there, but that's inconvenient for me considering I can't make Instagram Stories on PC or post things. I'm greatly disappointed and annoyed that no matter what I search up nothing concerning this problem is addressed by the Instagram team. I'm annoyed that no matter what I do (uninstall, restarting phone, logging out) nothing has worked. Even after another update the problem still is there. I'm disappointed and upset, and I've had to message people over discord, and I hope this gets fixed soon or else I'll have to find a new social media app to post on."
38,Eyera101,"July 2, 2019",2,"Great, but turned out horrible! 😯😡 I installed Instagram because the app said you needed to be 12. I had it for a few months and eventually my posts totaled to about 80. I had taken pictures of holidays, trips, vacations, my family, and my dog. For a while, everything was fine and I loved the app, but then I made another slime account. I made this account and started using both of them. After a few days, I was asked to put in my age for some reason on my first account. The one with all my memories. I put it in and the age said I was 12. I then had to try to put in my age a few more times, but I put the same age in. I then was forced off of my first account. I clicked the button to save my pictures, but it didn’t work. I was so confused because the app said I needed to be 12, but I got an email saying I  had to be thirteen. The app said YOU NEED TO BE 12 NOT 13!!!  I was so mad and upset. All of my memories were gone and I couldn’t recover my photos.  This needs to be fixed and I want my photos back. "
39,bronze9,"April 30, 2020",4,"Great, but needs some issues fixed. Instagram as a whole ever since I got it last summer has a been a great experience for me. I’ve been able to connect with my friends faster than I would’ve without it, and it’s a good thing to have when I’m bored and have nothing else to do. However, after having Instagram for many months I have discovered a couple of issues that are driving me nuts. First, on the home page once every so often the several most recent posts get mixed up in a seemingly RANDOM ORDER. I don’t like this at all because the post that gets moved to the top is most likely a post that I don’t want to see again for a while, like today that post is one that I don’t like at all and would rather not see AGAIN, and also because I someone who likes his home page posts to be precisely in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. Second, when an Instagram update comes around, the caption for it should say more than just fixing bugs and issues on Instagram, like what exactly that update is going to do with certain pages on the app and why. Please take the time to deal with these issues that I’ve stated above so that in the near future I’ll be able to confidently give Instagram a FIVE STAR RATING instead of a four star rating."
40,Imsteved,"December 13, 2017",2,"Some issues While I enjoy this app, I've been using it for 3 years, there are some recent issues that have been bothering me. All the updates have just been going downhill since the chronological order of your feed was removed. My feed is a mess of the same people over and over again with posts from many days ago because instagram thinks I want to see that stuff above everything else. The ""solution"" was to help you stay up to date with the posts you miss, but now I am missing more posts in my feed than before because of this system. I recommend making it an option in settings to turn on chronological order of your feed, it would make things so much easier. Another issue I have is that I recently noticed that the accounts you follow are no longer in chronological order either? There seems to be no organized way they are put in order, it's just like it was randomly thrown in there like that. This proves to be very difficult for me to find accounts I have recently followed as they no longer show up at the top of my followed box. I am following over 1,600 accounts so I have a very hard time remembering the name of an account I just followed. I just wanted to find one account and now it's lost in the many accounts I follow. Please make these changes, it would make the app so much easier to use."
41,Rae Knight,"July 26, 2018",1,"Honestly this is getting annoying You guys need to start listening to your users. Everything on here is just so messed up, the whole algorithm thing is annoying, and the feed/comments should be in chronological order. I don’t want to see someone’s post from two weeks ago I want to see the posts that were posted an hour or two ago. Also it isn’t fair that only certain story stickers are available to everyone. Yes I get that when you release things to the public it take time for everyone to get it so that’s understandable but when only some stickers are released to certain people that’s when it becomes unfair. I want to be able to add links to my stories but I can’t because it’s not released to everyone or not everyone has gotten the update yet. Also some lgbtq+ post have been taken down and honestly that’s just not right what is so wrong with lgbtq+ is it effecting anyone personally? No, no it’s not. Also being a depression help account on instagram I find it really rude that you take down posts that talk about depression/anxiety/self harm, then give people lousy websites that that so called ‘help people’ with that stuff. Just leave the posts up so someone can hopefully find the post and give/get the person that posted it needed help that will actually help them. Instagram please just start listening to your users or Instagram is just going to become as dead as Facebook."
42,editingaverg,"August 21, 2018",2,"instagram editors i’m sure instagram knows by now that a lot of people use their platform to share edits. there’s lots of editing accounts on instagram (i have 3). but as editors, we have lots of problems with your app. i’ll start with the biggest one, the percentage thing. where it says “this post is doing 80% better than your other posts.” since editors have gotten the instagram update, our views/likes have gone wayyyy down. and we believe it’s something to do with the rule that only a small percentage of our followers can see our posts. that is just so unfair. we spend hours/days at a time working on edits. they’re not easy to make. but we do it because we love to edit & we want to make our followers happy. editors work their butts off and deserve more than 5% or 7% of their followers to see them. problem 2. instagram quality. when we export our edits they’re in good quality. but when we post them the quality just goes down? that’s a huge letdown when you spend hours on an edit, just to post it and it has bad quality. problem 3. only 5 accounts? if anything there should be unlimited accounts. other editors & i probably want to create more than 5 accounts, because we like to edit more than 5 people! instagram, your app used to be a very good platform for editors, but you honestly need to fix your stuff. "
43,MissV_3,"December 30, 2018",1,"Instagram is a bully They will delete your account without any warning and it doesn’t matter if your content is good or bad. They don’t care how their users feel about the new algorithm updates. Don’t bother trying to make a complaint, no one will respond. Your content gets restricted or shadow banned depending on what you post or what hashtags you use. If you’re a conservative, don’t bother using this bias platform to voice your opinions, they will shut you down. You’ll see the same 20 people on your timeline regardless of how many 1000s you follow. Advertising is everywhere and can’t be avoided! Don’t post often? Consider your account deleted for not using it. The new algorithm makes you interact more with followers so that your content is seen but yet my likes continue to drop and more of my longtime followers have unfollowed me. When I message them to ask why they all said they didn’t unfollow me and thought I did. So not only does Instagram restrict accounts they don’t like or consider popular but will also remove some of your most active followers to keep your content from being seen. They act as if they are too good to be true but are really setting themselves up to less than MySpace in a few years."

CONSTANTLY!!! in between stories there’s tons of ads, and they’re STILL making it so their users have to pay for their audience to even see their posts, asking us for more money as if they’re not making enough off many many ads. It’s exhausting, I’m so sick of thing I don’t care about being shoved in my face when I’m trying to keep up with artists, businesses & people I love.

47,auoso y ucucuuchalwfou,"April 12, 2019",2,"Broken Instagram has been completely messed up for me the past few days. The biggest problem is, every time I click on a notification (from within the app or from a push notification) it only opens the comment section on that post, not the actual post. So I will click on the notification, it shows me a bunch of comments, but there’s no way to see the post itself; I’ll forget what the notification is and never end up seeing the post. Even clicking on my own post from notifications if someone likes it does the same thing. Another thing is I keep getting notifications from the same post, sometimes hours later. Also, another horrible problem is if somebody sends me a post from a private account that I don’t follow, and then I start following that account, even after I get approved it still says in the dms “this is a private account follow them to see this message” so I don’t know what post was sent to me. Gets super annoying. Lastly, this one isn’t a huge deal but it still a weird glitch: sometimes when I open a video somebody sent in dms (from camera roll, not a post) the sound from that will keep playing on Instagram. Leaving the app and coming back doesn’t stop it, the only thing that stops it is closing the app in multitasking. Hope you guys are working on these issues, thanks"

They have had i believe 2 updates since and yet STILL the problem has not been fixed. My app is up to date and the device I am using is an iphone 8+ with an ios that is also currently up to date. Whenever I check my dm inbox, nothing pops up like no conversations or group chats, although I have had conversations with other before. Nothing shows, and the only way I could pull up my dm’s with another person is to create a new message and select the person’s name. After exiting, the person’s @ is the only thing that shows up on screen and no one else’s. I’ve refreshed it multiple times but to no avail. In addition, everytime I exit instagram or go onto a different account, my inbox goes back to being empty as if I had never sent anyone a message before. This has not been an issue in any other account that I log in to. I have also searched for solutions on the internet and YES, there is quite a handful people on the internet who also are currently experiencing this problem and according to one of them, they have had this problem for around 4 months as well. Instagram has done NOTHING to solve it, although there are many people who are evidently experiencing the same difficulty."
49,Teeee44,"June 13, 2019",1,"Worst contact support ever!! Apparently, Instagram has had a glitch with the temporary deactivation process for years according to many articles. The problem is, a user may deactivate their account and then reactivate it only to find some posts (or all) are missing. For me, it was only my most recent post. Now, before making any assumptions , no the post did not violate any rules. The post sat on my profile for weeks with no issues. The decision to deactivate was my choice, not Instagram’s (I was not banned or anything). I have tried upgrading my app(twice), deleting the app and reinstalling, logging in from other devices (phone and computer) l, etc. Unfortunately, after countless attempts of reporting the problem, contacting support and trying to receive help, I have received no responses. This is a mistake on their end, not the users. I have deactivated several times before and this hasn’t happened. Since I’ve been forced to result to google for solutions (because Instagram won’t help me) I learned that this not only is common, but has been happening to users since like 2016. Most of which never received solutions, their post never came back, and never received responses from Instagram’s support system. As much money you people make off of users the least you could do is have a functional contact support system and actually try to help users for your app’s bugs and glitches."
50,leahg726,"March 13, 2018",2,"The New Algorithm is Worse I own a photography business and have a business Instagram account which I love as it shows insights and engagement. This tool has helped me tailor and grow my following to close to 2,000 people. However, I had noticed a dramatic reduction in the amount of “likes” and “engagement” on my posts. Before the new update, I would receive around 300 likes with 1,500 people seeing my post and now I’m lucky to get 150 “likes” and 600 people seeing my posts. This is frustrating as it’s completely stunted my growth as a business and I’m helpless to do anything about it, even when I post at peak times. One of my peers had mentioned to me that the app now judges the percentage of followers that “like” your post within the first 10 minutes of you posting to determine how many of your followers will be shown your post. This has hurt me a lot as my posts now don’t get enough engagement to make it on discover pages or show up at the “top” of locations when I tag them. Not everyone uses Instagram everyday and if your following isn’t composed of hyperactive users, your posts will get completely pushed aside and buried. Please fix your algorithm so I can continue to grow my business and portfolio. I love Instagram and this app has been a huge benefit to reaching more consumers, please change it back, thank you."
51,buddy Walrus,"August 13, 2018",3,"IG dared to sideline posts from my actual friends. I recently got into taking photos and one of the best ways to quickly share my images with others is Instagram. I can also connect with other great photographers and it has helped expand my perspective on the art. This is invaluable to me. However, recently my feed has utterly ceased to show me pics from people who i follow and like the most. The more popular a profile is, the more it shows up, so that, for example, i just began to see 10+ nat geo posts at a time in a few minutes even though i hit like on a lot of other images from other people. So i had no choice but to unfollow the nat geo profiles, which i did not have to do a few months ago. As for the people i know irl and like every single one of their posts, i no longer get any notification of their posts, and i may or may not even see it on my feed until it is a day old or more. I dont even care about the ads, they are actually targeted towards me very well. I am currently considering other platforms to share my images but unfortunately this is the most well known. Once a good one pops up it will be my pleasure to switch. Sorry IG, but its very clear that you do not value me as a user whatsoever. In reality you will not look at this review at all."

53,Just Advice,"December 27, 2018",1,"It’s not worth bothering anymore I’ve had Instagram for over three years, and as time has moved on, the app got worse, I run an account that used to get over 100,000 views per post, but now that they changed the algorithms to benefit only advertisers (a very sneaky and Miley hungry move, like Facebook does) my posts will rarely get more than 5,000 views. Hundreds of other accounts and I work to make our posts show up on the explore page and build a community, but now all you can find on the explored page are irrelevant posts and ads. Also, I’m pretty sure everyone on Instagram had been begging for a chronological feed as long as Instagram has existed. Well we got an update to our feeds, but definitely not what we were hoping for. The December 27th update where you swipe sideways like a story to see your feed may have just ruined Instagram. It is so inconvenient to access the explore page, switch accounts, go to your profile, and post on your story. You can’t tap or swipe to switch stories without accidentally pulling up random stats you really don’t need to see, and it’s very difficult to do one handed, which is one of the things that made Instagram so easy and accessible. I know this update is taking me off Instagram, and I’m sure I’m not the only one leaving for good. Please Instagram, actually listen to your users when making an update and don’t pretend this is what we want."

On that note: I would love a “stop chatting” option. I accidentally clicked the accept button when cleaning my screen for someone and they keep messaging me non stop even after I told them I wish to no longer chat with them, and after I explained that I accepted them by mistake, they keep chatting with me. I don’t like how I have asked many people and they all told me that my only option is to block the person. I find that extreme to block someone over me accidentally clicking “Accept”. "
57,Ndbd kdnd help!,"July 1, 2019",3,"Fix it pls?? I’ve had this app for YEARS and it’s never been this much of a mess. I have three accounts on the same phone that all have different formatting on the profile screen, which makes it difficult and confusing to switch between them. Unnecessary changes keep being made that actually sometimes hurt my experience, like the new post formatting that’s confusing and worse than before (that also only appears on one of my accounts). Sometimes the music or gif stickers disappear on one account but not the other. The profile pictures keep switching sides. Sometimes the app just crashes. At this point it just feels like Instagram keeps getting rearranged with no real upgrades. Instead of changing format all the time you should work on increasing video, picture, and sound quality, video time limits, slideshow post limits and stuff like that that could really help or convenience people. I prefer the original profile format with the profile picture on the left and the post feed, tagged photos, AND saved on the action bar, because the new formats feel clunky and bad. The new updates are just inconvenient and uninviting in general. Many of my friends feel the same way and also have accounts with different version updates to the app."

Another problem is that Instagram has logged me out of multiple accounts for no reason, causing me to have to start a new account and lose everything on my other accounts. I know this is instagrams fault as I have never given my password to anyone (online or real life) therefore, couldn’t have been hacked. I’ve also recently been “banned” from liking posts for two days, which dosent make sense because the pop up said that it was do to “my previous use of the feature.” I like completely normal content and had no reason to banned. I know I’m not the only one experiencing problems either, Instagram always shuts down and doesn’t load, and not because of WiFi, everyone on the app complained at one point and it became a thing where everyone flooded to twitter. They to fix their issues because I’m getting tired of having problems with the app. Other than these reoccurring inconveniences, I like the app when it’s working."
59,#Jakeisswag,"December 20, 2019",1,"Updates? No. Stop making unnecessary “improvements.” For starters, I don’t want “instagram - from the company that sold your data to Russians in an attempt to win the 2016 presidential election” (Muller report concluded this; So did Ocasio-Cortez’s questioning of Zuckerberg). Considering Instagrams heavy youth use, and the prevalence of being against corruption, this distance would be an obvious marketing point. I think one of the main reasons people use Instagram is because they prefer that diversity between apps; even though it’s owned by Facebook. Not to mention the fact that now, the DM’s look scarily similar to messenger. I have to ask exactly why? Users prefer differences between their apps. If they wanted a messenger-like experience, they’d get messenger. I’d greatly appreciate the app to not lose a significant amount of user support. Also, the algorithm has consistently failed us. If you could address and correct these problems before they become even more of an issue, that would be great. Facebook to most Instagram users, it leads a feeling of uncertainty and mistrust. Our data was sold to a foreign nation. That’s unacceptable. So saying “Instagram- from Facebook” while making substantial changes to the app; it’s quite concerning. The app was amazing before. Now? No. Not at all. If this wouldn’t have happened, you’d have five stars. Zuckerberg has destroyed facebooks reputation. It’s not too late for Instagram... yet."
60,gpapazian,"October 30, 2017",1,New algorithm is killing this app I've read a few other reviews and many of the stories also seem to apply to me. I've been using Instagram for years and I loved how it was a relevant social media platform that's not completely bogged down by ads and politics.
61,annabelle keasling,"July 3, 2018",1,"I am mad So one day I was peacefully scrolling through Instagram and I thought I should watch stories , so I go up to the top and the stories are all gone . So I thought “ oh it’s probably just a one time thing , I will just close the app and try again “ so I got back on and what do you know the stupid stories still aren’t there . Then I decided to look it up on google and apparently it is a very common problem and there is no known fix for it , so I decided maybe I should just delete the app and re-install it . So I deleted it and went on the App Store and searched up Instagram and it was gone , so I changed the filter to “iPhone only ” STILL didn’t show up . So at this point I was very upset , and I couldn’t think of what to do then finally it hit me , I should look on my purchased app history . So I looked up “ Instagram ”"
62,andrew_colin_,"July 14, 2018",2,"Maintenance I have had a frustrating issue for several months now where certain features either make the app crash suddenly, or do not work entirely. One feature that does not work at all. Not a single time... is the ability to post multiple photos in a singular post. I’ve tried with just 2 photos. I’ve tried with the maximum amount of photos in a photoset(10). Not a single time has this worked. After adding a caption with some hashtags, tagging friends, and waiting for the post to load. It fails to post every single time. I’ve tried this on both my old phone iPhone 6S plus, as well as my most recent phone purchase the iPhone X. This feature has never worked for me, often times being so frustrated I’d neglect the app for a few days and then find myself back. After attempting to delete the app as well as the app cache and reinstalling on both phones the feature is still inoperative. I also agree with many other Instagram users that the feed is very annoying that I’ll see posts I’ve seen already, or posts from several days ago. Chronological order?? If Instagram was more oriented on creating a seamless working application they may have a lot more users, or more frequent users of the app. Every bug I’ve experienced, I’ve submitted through the in app report a bug."
63,Aingealina,"January 13, 2019",1,Unfair! Please stop deleting fan pages. It’s unacceptable. You are deleting pages with followers with over 1k to 15k how does that make sense?! Why aren’t you deleting accounts that people don’t even use that are just sitting around not accounts that are used everyday and are posting and liking and sharing?! It makes no sense why you would shut down a page that worked so hard to gain the following it did. It’s not like we are impersonating the people we make accounts about we post edits and make video edits of them you can clearly see when you look at the posts and not just the profile pictures and bios. It takes time out of these peoples days to make these edits and they really care about them you can’t just act like you don’t care about your audience using your app and if you don’t that’s bull. I can tell that you are clearly using some sort of computer system to do this because it’s all sorts of messed up and I hope it gets fixed because I love Instagram and I have three accounts that I use everyday. Two of which are personal but the other one is a fan account that I have built up a following on and I have no clue what I would do if I lost it. I would probably never make another fan account or even personally delete my other accounts because I would’ve so upset. Please let people have the accounts back this is not fair at all!
64,Daysha Morales,"January 31, 2019",3,"Please change the new layout of how you view accounts I have been on Instagram for about 7 years now and I’ve always loved it but please please please listen to your users. My Instagram updates by itself even though my automatic updates are off. I was just on Instagram about 30 minutes ago and it was fine now I go back on and my profile layout is completely different. My profile picture is now on the right side everything is clustered and it is very large, when I go to other peoples accounts it is the same and it is very annoying because it is very hard to navigate this way. Also please stop changing the Algorithm I understand that you guys do it because of advertising purposes but before I can see content from pages that I like I see about 30+ ads and even when I say don’t show things like this they some how still pop up. Posts from friends or businesses that I am interested in don poo up on my timeline the same day they are posted. A post from three weeks ago will pop on my timeline followed by one from 4 days ago and it is very annoying because I have to turn on post notifications just so that i can see content I am interested in and not jus advertisements. Please fix the layout of the way you view profiles!!"

But I must say Instagram Revolutionized my life. Obviously it was me that did most of the work but the networking which clearly be significantly different if it wasn’t for social media platform like Instagram. I do tattoos for a living and all of my clientele comes from people who email me after seeing my page of Instagram . People from all mover the world get to see my work and know who I am . Instagram came out when I started tattooing and what a blessing that was .I've been able to network with other artists and announce to public when I’d be in different states doing a guest appearance at other shops . It’s important not to get obsessed with your like and followers but they should also keep you motivated to keep leveling up in whatever your presenting on Instagram .  But anyway I just wanted to say a few years ago I decided to turn everything around in my life and when it came to getting into the tattoo industry Instagram had a huge impact on how I network my craft .

But I have one problem that started today June 6, 2019. So you guys probably know that if your in your story and about to post something and you can search up any type of music you want. By clicking the Music label that’s says “MUSIC” of course! Well y’all just added that what music u choose the lyrics show up. So I went to try that and I realized I couldn’t find the label that says “MUSIC” and I want you (Instagram) to tell me why is it gone? Can you do something about it? It really isn’t fair! And I know this has happened to other people before. I need to know is there a way for me to get it back?! You guys have to do something. I mean it’s boring if you want to add music to your story but u can’t! Because you don’t have the label “MUSIC”!! And can u please reply! I want you guys to tell me if I can do something or do I just have to wait for it to pop up..... (if it actually eve me comes back).                                        Sincerely,"

I have had Instagram since 2011 and I have never since then had an issue until the Music Tag feature rolled out and I haven’t been able to use it since then. I have tried so many things from updating everything, logging out and logging back in, uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times, going to someone’s story to look for the “Try It” button but nothing, unlinking my Facebook account, changing my password and updating profile.. which btw didn’t let me change it to my personal email because it was taken already, I have never used it so I clicked on forgot password to see who has been using my email but it says that it doesn’t exist so I’m a little confused on how it has been taken but doesn’t exist. But anyway I reported the Music Tag issue awhile back but haven’t heard back since then, so I reported the issue several times back to back to see if that works (prob not). All the research I have done over this issue has been through Google through other users experiences because IG doesn’t even have support help over this issue. The only thing that has inconveniently worked was to make a second account, everything shows up on there but as soon as I switch over to my account that I use it’s not there! INSTAGRAM..

It makes no sense that I can only see posts in my feed from people I interact with most—I don’t have time to scroll through my entire feed, but I pretty much only see about 20 of the accounts that I follow, no one outside those because I can’t “interact” with them.

70,Wheels McGee,"December 19, 2017",2,"Why mess with it? There are a few annoying changes that have been made recently in the app that I feel need to be voiced. First of all, the non chronological order that propagates our feed is frustrating to say the least. It feels clunky and I feel like I don’t get to see all the posts from users that I follow. I’m not even sure what the order of the feed represents. Are they popular posts? Top posts? At least give us the option to choose wether we want our feeds in chronological order or (omakase style). Another annoying change is with regards to the browse interface. You all know what I’m talking about. When you click a post to see the details you no longer can scroll up or down to see the other posts in the order of the thumbnails. Now it’s all similar posts. Whose idea was that? Oh and for some reason if you click on pic thumbnail that’s next to a larger video thumbnail, it only opens the video and not the post you actually are trying to see. The last thing that I can think of is when I’m on a user’s IG and I’m looking through their posts (thumbnails) when I click on one to see the details why can’t I scroll up or down to view the details of their previous or next post? I have to go back to thumbnails and then click the next. Ugh. Ok. I’m done. That felt good to get off my chest."
71,ABDIEN88,"April 3, 2018",3,"My Story Highlights Disappeared It appears that my instagram seems to get things such as Instagram stories, and later on story highlights, rather late in the game. As in months and months after most other people I know have gotten it. Sometimes I’ll get it in an update, get used to it, but by the following update it’ll be gone. Currently this is an ongoing battle with the story highlights. My friends can see the ones I’ve posted previously, but on my account on my phone, they are gone and the option to view mine or others is simply not present. I have a feeling it might have to do with the fact I do not have more than 400 followers. Those with low numbers possibly are at higher risk for getting the new features last? That’d be a real bummer if that’s the case. It’s not my phone, cause it’s a new model iPhone and it shouldn’t be the programming system, cause I’m on latest iOS and I update my phone and apps regularly. Hope they figure out this issue as well as bring back the  CHRONOLOGICAL FEED, because it would be pretty upsetting if they start allowing only those who’ve paid into the app, or bought a significant amount of followers to access their updates first, and some not at all, leaving the rest of us scratching our heads."
72,TessaSwagstar,"June 8, 2018",3,"Great, buuut.... It’s amazing and a great social media platform, the same instagram we’ve always had just a little better with every update. I like the new features, but the new bullying filter feature is removing some of the most simple comments, especially when it comes to songs for some reason? Like people will ask for a song name in the comments and if you reply for some reason it won’t let me comment the name of the song, and like they’re really simple like “Sorry-Justin Bieber” got filtered out."
73,straphanger nyc 83,"October 20, 2018",4,"Instagram is fine on its own, good differentiation I like Instagram because of the way you can focus content and link your images through hashtags. The new feature name tags is redundant. I am not into it. I would hate to see this platform become a carbon copy of Snapchat just for pure competition. My point is about demographics and differentiation,  Instagram lets everyone get in on the fun and not just certain age groups or business vs non business so Snapchat is clearly for much younger groups. I think if they do become too much like Snapchat or another platform that they will no longer be a leader in social media platforms. I don’t like the stories feature either but I do love having options to post as image or images that can become videos as posts. I honestly don’t use Instagram to watch videos so too much of that could get old. But sure in Japan these features are all included. I also detest when products copy each other so I hope you guys remain innovators in the US and not sheep! Otherwise I’m jumping ship and leaving social media to the naive teens and 20 somethings. I’m probably the only one on the planet who thinks like this so maybe I’ll just go and build my own app instead, j.k!"

First, you’ll see something from four hours ago then something from one day ago then something from five minutes ago so, yes, the timeline is a little wacky. That’s the only thing I can really think of though that could be worked on but, other than that, I really have no complaints about the Instagram app."

I tried to close all my apps and shut down my phone because, I’m on it a portion of the day and I thought that would be the troublesome issue, but I turned it on, same blank feed, can’t click on stories and my explore page is just filled with random photos. And so I deleted the app redownloaded it, and logged back on. Took me a while to log on because it sent a message saying there’s an issue try again later, or something among the lines of it, and I tried again, beginning to feel annoyed and bitter about the whole situation when it worked! I was super excited, but then nothing loaded again, besides my direct messages, which I can’t complain about, but if you could prevent this from happening that would be spectacular! And so no one else had my same complaint. That’s all really, other than that this app is very addictive and well thought out."
76,Joe Peffer,"May 31, 2019",3,"Death of Organic followers was the Death of Instagram. Title says it all. Not everyone wants to be a business and pay for followers and promotions. IG was already making enough with ad revenue. But killing the organic feed was about the most blatant sign of greed i’ve seen from a social media platform. We expected it from Facebook, and naturally everyone saw it coming with the merger. Its absurd to think that because you dont pay per post, even with a good follower to post activity ratio, your posts dont take priority among your own followers or area. Instagram took the fun out of discovering people and forces those who pay to play down your throats. The bigger accounts just saturate the market and everyone else gets forgotten. Personal pages should NOT be penalized for not paying to promote posts where as business profiles should. IG, like every Google product, is self imploding and destroying itself by its obsession with catering to ads. Not the creatives who even bring traffic to IG in the first place. Remember what happened to Tumblr? The first IG? Yea its going in that direction. The censorship and bias towards trending profiles alone is going to kill this platform just like Facebook is suffering from. And dont get me started on the spam and scam messages/ comments that plague this app."
77,thutspecialboi,"February 6, 2020",2,"Doesn't care about users Instagram had quickly become one of my favorite apps for sharing images and texting my friends. However in recent years instagram has started to slip downhill. The fact that instagram had to get fake people to review the app is sad but anyway. Instagram has removed a lot of fan favorite features and completely ignored us when we pleaded for them to add it back. So they they've removed likes, ability to see who's viewed ur story after 24hrs, custom location tagging, Chronological feed, etc. The worst part is everytime they remove a feature people always get upset and plee for instagram to add those features back, but they don't, instagram stubbornly ignores all of their users opinions. On top of all this their app has TOO many glitches, sometimes ur DMs will randomly stop working so you can't text anyone or receive messages, AND IT USUALLY GOES ON FOR MONTHS! This has happened to me and my friends on MULTIPLE accounts. Whenever we ask instagram for assistance they blatantly ignore us, NO word back from them. Lastly why do my friends and I all have slightly different versions of instagram despite being in the same country?? Some of my friends have colored names in gc's or different theme colors, some can still see likes others can't, whats the point in doing that??"
78,Stanback09,"February 2, 2020",1,"“Anti-social” Social media Instagram team, in efforts to make your platform more inclusive or enjoyable, you’ve taken away basic features that actually created a social experience. Firstly, the limit on following, unfollowing, liking, commenting, is asinine in its implementation. This severely cripples those of us who: 1. Use this as a business platform, and engage with sizable audiences. 2. Those who simply may want to alter their feeds content as their tastes have changed, and are now left with no recourse in doing so. Secondly, removing the number of likes being viewable to all on a post should be an option, not mandatory. If a user wants to have their likes hidden let them, but don’t force that again on business platforms, who need to boast numbers to increase engagement, same goes with private influencers. Third, why stifle independent app developers of 3rd party applications, they simply are trying to enhance our experience of instagram for us, because of the extreme limitations being imposed as of late. 3rd party applications should indeed be slowed to manage and integrate with the original application to cultivate a more robust social experience. All in all, the changes through the past several months have been nothing short of constricting, with no actual resolution in sight from your end, despite the many who are calling for a significant walk back of your actions."

Fb got way too bogged down with “stuff”. Loads of crap I didn’t want to wade through in order to see what my friends were up to or to see pictures of my nieces that live in another country. So, instagram felt like a more natural clutter free platform. But, you had to follow in fb’s steps and have the audacity to decide you or some algorithm know what I want to see in my feed. Stop. You don’t know what I want to see and quit trying to think you do. If I follow a person It’s because I have some interest in them. When I click on Instagram to have a gander I want my feed to 😱 actually include everyone I follow. And, god forbid, I’d like it in chronological order. For many reasons I want it in chronological order and I’d hope the powers that at fb/instagram HQ are smart enough to figure it out. Put in all the ads you want, you gotta pay the bills- I get it, but leave my feed alone. Let me see everyone I follow without having to go directly to their page/feed. And, do it in order!

Instagram has unfortunately made it so easy to buy followers, and this can be a very dangerous thing. There are surgeon accounts, banking accounts, makeup accounts, marketing accounts with hundreds of thousands of fake followers. They buy these fake followers in order to seem more reputable. What these scammers, a lot of the time, fail to notice, is that the like counts and the followers don’t match. Me personally when I am on Instagram, I see a lot of promotion posts for makeup courses from “famous” makeup artist, but these makeup artist are just stealing pictures and tricking people. The “likes” being displayed is a great way to immediately locate a fake “famous” Instagram account and prevent scammers from taking information from your users. At the end of the day they’re just likes. It doesn’t hurt anyone to see the likes, but it does hurt to not see them. PLEASE KEEP THE LIKES AVAILABLE TO SEE!! If it offends people that much it would be great if there was an option for accounts to turn off their ability to see other people’s like numbers and theirs. Please just add a new feature that allows us to see the likes if we want to."

I can hardly comment on people’s posts now without being blocked. It’s been happening pretty much every day. I’m constantly having to write to instagram letting them know that I’m blocked and to please unblock me. I feel like this is a social media app but we’re getting punished for being “too social”. It really takes away the fun of using it when I’m constantly being blocked. I get that there are spam accounts but there are a ton of people getting blocked that aren’t spam accounts. It’s getting a little bit ridiculous lately. A lot of us like to enter giveaways and comment on each other’s posts and we’re getting punished for using the app. I really hope something can change and this can get fixed because it’s really taking away the fun of using the app. I really truly love this app so much but all these rules and getting banned constantly is just so frustrating and really ruining my experience using this app.

But I made a new page recently that is more of a blog that I’m trying to get followers on and Instagram is making that IMPOSSIBLE for someone to do their “right” way. Woke up this morning with 9 new followers so I followed them back and I have not use a single 3rd party app but I just got pushed out of my account with them saying I used a 3rd party app for likes and followers when that was just me in the morning following people back and liking photos. I am CONSISTENTLY getting soft blocked from liking pictures and adding people because I guess I “do it too much” but isn’t that the point of Instagram? And the crazy part is I don’t even do it that much! How am I supposed to build a following if you won’t even let me ENGAGE with people like I’m supposed to! I I don’t know what Instagram needs to do to fix this but I hope they know I will continuously report problems any time they soft block me because it’s not fair or right and if I ever lose my page when I haven’t done a single thing wrong I’d just be done with the whole app.

Before it Was so easy to make friends now it’s horrible because most of the people are famous and never respond back, have thousands or probably millions of followers and there’s the first ones to pop out because of the Chronological order that was removed. Please change!!!! There are so many other creators that are trying to get out there and they can’t get any where because you decided to put this new update that lets others creators they are ready out there get even more famous to get more feed. Like moving every to the bottom of the food chain."
92,M9I7A3,"October 13, 2018",5,"I’ve had Instagram for awhile I’ve been using Instagram for a very long time and I’ve always loved the app, but ever since that new update, my accounts have been acting up. I have five different accounts that I am logged into and today I was logged out of my main account and it’s not letting me log back in. I checked on my iPad to see if I was still logged in there, and I was. I try to log back in but it’s telling me the maximum number of accounts has been reached and when I try to log out of one account it’s still there thus not allowing me to log into my main account. Some of my friends even complain about how they keep getting logged out. Also one of my accounts isn’t updated, my main account has always been updating, but the latest update my other accounts don’t have. If there is an update it should apply for all accounts not just one or two. I love the app, but some small things need to be changed. I rated this five stars so you guys can actually take the time to see this because it isn’t fair I and many others need to deal with this all the time."
93,Heartssmarts,"November 17, 2018",4,"listen to this Four stars, one issue. Overall I love the app, but you've made it hard for people like me to redeem themselves before a problem evolving and/or the panic of it doing so by creating the feature that sends people notifications whenever somebody deletes a message in their chat. What I'm talking about touches up on OCD, anxiety, and just anyone who's trying to do things right and land somewhere. Doesn't matter which three it is, if you make a typo, say something that sounds interpreted a different way than you intended and want to fix it, or talking business and accidentally mess up, this feature takes our one chance at (as said) redemption and now instead we have to either look or feel messy in replace of looking shady in the eye of the other person when Instagram tells them we deleted a message. We're basically a cat with two lives but now even the chance, which matters and is helpful, that we're going to survive another lifetime is brought down to zero. Please be considerate. I've had lots of Instagram crashes in the past, still when I press gifs it does crash but this topic is most important. Take the feature away."
94,Responsible Shoppaholic,"January 14, 2019",3,"Serious info update lag There is a serious lag with the comment and like updates as well as people following and unfollowing. I haven’t had anyone unfollow me in a long time, I don’t post a lot and the people who are following me are all people I’ve known or had on here for years... recently I’ve been posting a lot more and I get notifications on my phone 10 times a day that I have a new follower but the number only changes by like 2 or it goes down. Same with likes or comments on posts, I go to look and there’s nothing there or no change to what was.. Also when posting a video it shows number of ‘views’ but one ‘like’, when you click on it it shows the list of users who liked it.. what’s the purpose of not having the 2 totals actually side by side? I don’t care about followers or likes but when my phone is buzzing all the time with notifications and I get on here to look and it’s not registering it’s pretty annoying. Increasingly so that I want to stop using the app. I’m in school to be a talent manager and social media is a large platform for building connections. So I think you should do some bug fixes, maybe the lag is from the ridiculous influx of unnecessary ads you allow. #sellouts just sayin"
95,mc83676,"July 8, 2019",5,"love instagram, but... i love instagram! one of my favorite apps! just one issue, i would love for there to be an option to remove just one of the photos posted in the multiple photos option. i really like being able to post more than one photo, but sometimes i look back on one of the pictures and change my mind about it and wish to delete just that single one, not the whole post. another great idea would be to allow us not only to delete one specific photo but also be able to move/rearrange the pictures we posted without having to repost the entire thing. these options could be incorporated with the “edit” button & with each “slide” of pictures posted there could be a delete button which would only delete THAT picture, not the others. as for the rearrange choice, there could be an option with all the other choices like delete, archive, turn off commenting, etc. I know i’m not the only user with this desire so these slight changes would make a huge difference to users and make instagram an even more enjoyable app!! please consider!!! thanks!"
96,snowbunnyx,"September 24, 2019",1,"ANYONE CAN DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT! I’ve had over 10 instagrams since the app first came out. I model & over the past years I’ve had over 50k followers , 15k followers , etc etc . And it kept getting deleted . My last Instagram I only had 2000 followers and it got deleted . I put money in my Instagram. I promote stuff and I promote my own pictures by paying Instagram. Some girl even made a fake page of me and she had it for 4 years and SHE NEVER GOT DELETED! So how come people can make fake pages of me , I see girls sucking penis and posting nudes but I can’t have my professional account? And when I try to report someone they say “there’s nothing wrong with this personals page” then how come I get deleted every time ? Yea everyone has haters but Instagram SHOULD NOT allow me to get deleted . The same way they tell me “nothing is wrong with this account” is the same way they should tell the other people when they report me ! I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with Instagram. OH ! And once they delete your Instagram they bann you from having the app so now you can’t even make a new one you need a whole new phone cus they bann your Apple ID and everything . If I download the app NO ONE not even someone with a legit account can log in. It’s literally banned on my phone I need a whole new phone and this is the third phone I have !!!!! Just for INSTAGRAM!! YALL ARE TRASHH!!"
97,scarlwtr,"July 3, 2019",5,"Bug fixes needed badly Hey Instagram! I am struggling on this app because whenever I try to post either on my story or my account it says, ""we'll try again when there's a better connection."" And I've restarted my connection logged out logged in and all I get is the same old same old. I get that Instagram just builds a bigger variety a day and it's hard to just register that there is just to much glitching. I get that there is A LOT going on in this app at once, the population is huge I get it. But I can't do ANYTHING without it say ""we'll try again when you have a better connection·"" and yet, my connection is just fine! I don't understand why or why when I post something it also deletes itself. I seem to post a lot on my account which maybe is the reason but, I'm not as active all the time so idk why it says all this. I close out the app go in again and... Bam; NOTHING!!! Yayyyy!! No. It's really difficult as well but also very annoying."
98,chris13y,"April 10, 2020",2,"Little rant Instagram started going downhill when it messed up the order in your feed from chronological order to whatever order it’s in now. Then they made it so when you go to unfollow someone it pops up with four different options instead of just unfollowing like it used to. It just adds another unnecessary step same with how many steps it takes to see the posts you’ve liked or the ones you’ve saved. Now instagram is removing some small features that redeemed the app. Like being able to click the little “mentioned circle” in the bottom right of a post to see a list of the people mentioned, this was especially useful when people tag everyone in the same spot. For some reason, instagram also removed the feature to hear audio by turning your volume up or down and you’d need to tap the video. At first it wasn’t that inconvenient but then when trying to watch stories I noticed there was no sound unless I left the story and found a post with sound just to enable it. Maybe there’s an easier way but it’s not very clear and I believe it’s instagrams responsibility to make its app’s experience seamless and clear. I’m not sure why instagram keeps making these changes. Maybe they’re just mistakes but they really need to be fixed."
99,Amkale72,"October 23, 2019",4,"Not user friendly!!! 😡 This is a fun app until you start actually having lots of friends/followers and Instagram blocks you from being able to do anything because you comment/type/read too fast. Or maybe it’s because you tag too many people or who really knows the reason why because Instagram is absolutely unclear on their rules and they don’t ever respond when you try to contact them through “help”.  I get that they have a problem with spam and bots, but that is their problem and they should find a better way of dealing with it other than blocking real people just trying to communicate with real followers/friends!  They could for instance, give a warning before actually blocking or perhaps put some type of timer or “speedometer” in the message box if they don’t want to allow users to type fast for some unknown reason.  They could have a way to prove that you’re a live person and go ahead and unblock you rather than just keeping you in instajail for days with no explanation.  It seems to me that in trying to block bots/spam they have become super user unfriendly!! Come on Instagram, get innovative and do better!!!"
100,anon4206969,"October 4, 2017",3,"It’s great (but...) Alright so I’ve instagram for probably 5 or 6 years now and it’s great! I have three accounts and I love how manageable they are and how it’s so simple to post and search for photos, users, etc. "
101,D IMMORTAL,"November 8, 2017",3,"Scrambled Order of Posts 😒 I have used Instagram for ages, and during all those years I have never once had a complaint about the app. But ever since the posts on my newsfeed have been scrambled, I have been missing out on a lot of my followers’ posts, requiring me to scroll for ages just to make sure I’m caught up, and sometimes I come across posts from friends that were posted maybe three-five (or more) days ago that I’m just now seeing. It’s honestly so irritating; it’s discouraged me from even bothering to scroll through my newsfeed and instead click on specific accounts one by one to make sure I didn’t miss any posts from them, or turning on post notifications for a bunch of accounts. It’s a pain, to say the least. Instagram, I really hope you fix this issue. All of these updates for the app and none of them have to do with this major problem. Maybe instead of worrying about issuing new features to your app and mimicking other apps like Snapchat, you should focus on reversing issues that are making your customers unhappy, like the one I’ve addressed, to make Instagram better. It’s one of the most common complaints amongst IG users; you need to listen to your customers."
102,jvbgirls,"April 25, 2018",1,"app won’t work on my iPhone but will on others I have an iPhone 7 and I would like to use my instagram on my iPhone but the problem is that it won’t let me log in. I have deleted the app many many times too many to count and have restarted my phone and nothing will work. I have also emailed and called and even sent them questions asking why won’t my instagram app work on my iphone, and didn’t get a response back. It’s also very strange because I can log into my account and use my instagram on other people’s iPhones besides mine. I have also followed and read there community guide lines and privacy policy to see if I did anything wrong and I didn’t. When I try to log into the app with on my iPhone it says “sorry, there was a problem with your request.” I have tried making a new Instagram and I will get a small pop up message on my screen saying you have violated instagrams terms, community guide lines, and privacy policy. I’ll click on it and it’ll take me the the instagram he’ll center and it says that my account may have been disabled but the weird thing is, when I log into my account on other peoples iPhones it works and doesn’t say it’s disabled. So if the creator of this app would like to tell me how to fix this issue and let me use the app on my phone then please do. "
103,samiramichelle,"December 27, 2018",1,"Trash update I just want to start off by saying i have been a big fan of Instagram for as long as it has been out. Y’all were on point with the updates for a good minute but now they have become a hot booty mess! It all began when y’all changed the timeline from going in chronological order to just a random order of the pages you like most or look at the most. Idk exactly how to explain it but i hate it! I constantly miss out on things people have posted and they pop up on my feed and says posted 2 days ago like who tf wants to see that stuff now. And now we have an even bigger problem y’all done goofed and changed the timeline to tapping. Insta i just wanna talk for a second nie phone to phone... the stories ONLY, were made for tapping and the big hype about insta was scrolling. Shoot y’all already copied snap with the stories so the least y’all could do was stay consistent with the scrolling feed. Y’ALL HAD ONLY ONE JOB!!! I just wanna say all of your users hate this wack behind update including myself. Please do better or insta will be getting left in 2018 and it’s #Twitter2k19. Btw great way to end a year for yourself! Y’all sure know how to ruin stuff. Moral of this whole dang story just change everything back to normal including how the timeline works. Please and thanks."
104,gomezbieberdaily,"January 16, 2019",1,"Fan pages. I wont lie, at the beginning this was a really cool app where people from all over the world could come and join. Whether it was an account about them or really anything. About 3 years ago, i made a fan page that became rather popular very quickly. Took me hard work and a lot of time and finally reached about 200,000 followers (Which is a LOT! For a loser like me) it really changed my world. For me it wasn’t all about the followers, it was just about the people i got to interact with! People from other parts of the world who genuinely liked my page, and my opinions. It was so much fun! Made me have confidence in myself and changed my whole perspective on internet friends. Little did i know that would all come to an end so soon. About a year ago, exact. My account got disabled for copyright, i might’ve posted a pic or two that Instagram thought i shouldn’t have! I get that, but i was never able to properly talk to Instagram that i had full permission to use those candids. And there, my page is now dead along with so many others whose owners have taken so much time of their lives to update on. Its really sad that Instagram wouldn’t let u make at least one mistake but rather just deletes them with no questions, no answers, no nothing. I hope they work on this because fan pages MAKE the artist..."
105,I heart.......,"February 8, 2019",2,"Why Instagram? Why? The option to see users who have viewed Highlights (locates on users profiles) has been removed. It now says “viewer lists aren’t available after 24 hours”. This is absolutely ridiculous! These “highlights” are a permanent part of the users profile and NOT just a “story” that goes into IG archives after 24 hours. With a profile public, I should have the right to see who is viewing my highlights at ANY TIME. This was such a great feature and now like everything else, Instagram has ripped it away without users consent or opinion. With the little control users actually have on Instagram nowadays, this was the one feature I truly appreciated. It gave me the ability me to see who was visiting my page with the option to follow, ignore or block. Now we’re back to the primitive age of Instagram where you can stalk and creep around unnoticed. The users already have relinquished their ability to control endless ads, are forced to have unorganized feeds, and are unable to view stories chronologically. Please start listening to your users. Without us, you’re nothing and maybe it’s time to remember that. Please bring back this feature. And furthermore, please stop needlessly changing features that are beneficial to your loyal users."
106,Sifatullaha,"June 6, 2019",3,"Action blocked for almost three weeks Instagram is a great place to share life moments and it’s amazing to see places posts that I’ve never heard about, food that I never tried before, or someone we generally love like Dwayne Johnson. It the same time, I been having this issue almost three weeks now and I am constantly reporting this problem but I never got a response from instagram. It, an” ACTION BLOCKED”!!⚠️ one day I woke up and my friend just followed me on that morning so I was delighted to see her at my follower's list and so I tried to follow her back. I've got this message, again and again, day after day week after week and so I tried to report this problem again but never got a response!? I beg you ”instagram” to help me solve this problem, I would really appreciate you taking the time to respond back and solve this issue. I fully understand the importance of Instagram privacy and security and if I have made a mistake or have disobeyed the Instagram policy I would like to to know and what I can do to resolve this problem. I believe that everyone deserves to follow friends, family or someone we look up to on a platform that connects us together."
107,princessnyesnike,"April 1, 2020",5,"Great app Overall, Instagram for me has been a great experience. I’ve had Instagram for roughly 3 years now and haven’t really experienced any major issues. I just have a few suggestions, first of all a play and pause button could be nice. Not on igtv but on the explore page to if you can kinda see that. Next is no notifications for people I follow going live. If there was a way I could turn that off. But that’s all this is a great app if you are reading this I highly recommend it is a great way to connect in new ways! I absolutely LOVE the send a post to one of your friends feature! That’s just a FABULOUS idea I can share memes, the latest news, a funny video! You name it I can post it on my story or direct message it to one of my friends! Another thing I love is Instagram connection with its users! Recently I’ve been seeing the #stayhome story! This allows users to use the hashtag and be featured on their story! It also provides helpful and fun reminders of staying safe and healthy during times like these. But any ways highly recommend thanks you for reading! And thanks you instagram!"

I really am confused and annoyed by this but that’s fine I could always get a new account and just the guidelines better but I’m not getting to log into my new account through the Instagram app I always receive an error saying “Error: Sorry, there was a problem with your request” and this isn’t only on my iPhone, I’ve tried on another iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy tablet with the same error, also asked s friend to log in on my devices and the same error came up even though she was logged in on her device. So can you please help me to get back into the app and tips to help solve this issue. I’ve already deleted and reinstalled the app on all devices and that didn’t work. Hope you can assist me as soon as possible. "
109,Kutchakokkov,"December 13, 2019",1,"A platform rapidly declining in quality and user care I have had Instagram for about 5 ish years (since about 8th grade) and this recent year for some reason Instagram has been targeting my account and prompting me to change my password as I have “shared it with a website to gain followers” keep in mind i only have about 9 post and I never have given my passwords to anyone, I don’t even use the password rememberer on the iPhone. So I agree and change my password every time, this was the 20th time within the last 6 months and I’m running out of password ideas and it’s quite draining. Not only that I have been “shadow banned” 5 times and given 1-2 week long bands 3-5 times for no apparent reason then me unfollowing a bunch of European accounts and accounts I don’t care about. Any attempts to report the problem via the app have ended in failure and the report button has proven to be absolutely useless. I use Instagram as a way to communicate with classmates, colleagues, and potential employers when I could easily be using Facebook,line,Snapchat,Vero, and soooo many more other platforms that wouldn’t disregard users this way. I’m very close to not using Instagram at all because of this. I hope you can spare some time to figure out what is happening to my account that triggers your “spam?” Filters and put an end to it."
