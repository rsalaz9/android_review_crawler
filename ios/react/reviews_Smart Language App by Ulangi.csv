However, the pronunciation feature is able to be used on the initial word on the front of the flash card. If it could be used on the word that gets revealed, that would be AMAZING; because sometimes you don’t want the Spanish word first, you want the English word, THEN the revealed Spanish word with pronunciation. If you could make this change, that would be AWESOME! Thanks! :)"

2,Saggylee,"August 22, 2019",4,"Great but.. I was wondering if you were going to implement an easier way to import new vocabulary cards. Like importing my anki decks into this app is quite a hassle, having to write it down on my phone by hand for over 7000+ cards and sentences. Please help me and thanks."
