0,2xl993,"April 28, 2020",5,"Excellent program I greatly appreciate thes service. Very easy to search thru the app to select the items you want. Prices are shown, and are the same prices as in the store. You can select to allow substituitions if the item you want is not in stock. When you pick up your items you can elect to not accept the subsitute, and you are given credit right away. If you select no substitues then if they do not have the item, it shows that in your delivery notice on the app - and not charged, of course. After you have completed your list, you can keep adding items, as you think of them, up to midnight the day before. When you later go back into the app to add to add items, your list does not appear. You go ahead and select the item(s) you want, click to purchase and it will ask if you want to add it to your current order. Click “yes” then you can review your full order. They send you an email when it is ready for pick up (at the previous time you have requsted). You can also look at the app and see the progress as your order is being prepared. Then go to the store to the Pick Up area, park in front of a number and tell them you are there on the app. Or wait and they’ll come out and ask your name. It’s all simpler than this LONG explanation. Great Servce."
1,Gaspatchosoup,"April 23, 2020",1,Gonna stick with Target As soon as I get my 2 items that I have coming that won’t come on time I will be deleting the app and never going to Walmart or using this service again.  So canceled the items I had in order and went to the target app and bought them there. Within 2 hours they get shipped and didn’t pay anything extra shipping. 
2,Bossbakken,"December 12, 2018",3,Don’t fall for “2 day shipping” or savings catcher Loved this app and Walmart. But a couple of the main things I liked have actually changed for the worse. 
3,I Who Shall Remain Nameless,"May 4, 2019",3,No Pay-and-Go I read an article that said that the Walmart Corporation planned to discontinue Pay-and-Go at Walmart but not at Sam’s Club. That was the first that I’d heard that Walmart has Pay-and-Go so I decided to try it. I was underwhelmed.
4,the good RN,"August 11, 2018",5,"Savings Catcher- it works!!! I have been using savings catcher for a year now, been working to catch Walmart NOT giving me deals that I know other stores offer. Nope! Walmart ALWAYS give me those deals, they never ever miss!  One time I thought they did but I found out I was wrong. The other store had gone up on their price and it was I that was not aware... If you shop at Walmart you’d better download the Walmart app, use savings catcher, and stop playing around! I’ve already saved $65 so far without even trying, just buying my same ordinary groceries that I normally buy, not doing ANYTHING different. I don’t have time for coupons and price checking and stuff.  Wayyy too busy for that!  So, after I check out I get into my car, open the app real quick, scan my receipt real quick, then go home. Two days later I check the app and see the savings building up. Just that easy! Once I get to $100 I’ll redeem it for something. And it’s fun, the kids love watching it build up, too!.. You all better get this little extra money, we all deserve a break so why not? 😉"
5,Rtiger2,"November 9, 2018",2,"BRING BACK RECEIPT UPLOAD IN SAVINGS CATCHER I have been using the Walmart app, primarily for the use of Savings Catcher, for many years now. While I didn’t always get back tons of money, I always appreciated knowing that I was getting the best deal without shopping around while also being able to save my receipts digitally. I am incredibly disappointed in the recent move to linking receipt uploads ONLY through Walmart pay. I have chosen not to use Walmart Pay for personal and security reasons, not to mention that I also like to pay cash. This move (clearly to force users to use Walmart pay or miss out) disenfranchises so many users! There are many people who don’t feel comfortable using that pay method, or that just need to manually upload for many reasons. I know that you have lost me for sure from your app, and possibly from shopping as often, as receipt uploads to savings catcher made me shop there more often. If I can’t use Savings Catcher without being forced to use Walmart Pay, then this is no different than any other store... no more incentive to shop here. I genuinely want to use Savings Catcher and have the convenience of having receipts saved for me again. Bring manual uploads back and I’ll begin shopping here more frequently again."
6,Bail e,"May 16, 2019",1,"App is not that great I only downloaded the app for the savings catcher. At one point, you were able to submit printed receipts via the app. Then, it was changed to where you have to use Walmart pay to get rebates on competitors prices. Some weeks, no prices were better. Other weeks I was getting several dollars back per receipt! Walmart released an email yesterday stating they would end this in May because their prices were often cheaper than their competitors. I feel that is a lie considering I usually get cash back from the app on 3/4 of the receipts submitted. I will use the app until May but after that I will delete it and shop with the competitors as opposed to doing all my shopping with Walmart. Most of the said competitors allow digital manufacturers coupons on their apps or loyalty cards. Walmart doesn’t have a loyalty card or an option for digital coupons on the app. It is virtually useless as I can do anything else from the app on their website. Once savings catcher is gone, it is a waste of space. I will be using the balance left over from the savings catcher and deleting this app. It literally will no longer provide me with any benefits that I cannot get from using the general website. Your competitors will be thanking me when they start receiving more of my business!"
7,Mandala221,"January 1, 2018",4,"Suggestions... I love using this app. It’s been so convenient so many times BUT when I’m trying to find a certain item and I’m inside a Walmart store, I can’t search other Walmart stores. Even if I change the location of “My Store” to the location I’m trying to search, and even turning off my location, it still keeps me at the current store I’m in. This makes it difficult to search other locations without having to first leave the local store I’m in. I’m trying to search a different store so I’ll know beforehand if I need to buy a different product or order online. I’d like to search other locations while standing in one already! This has been an issue SO many times!"
8,LBoPres,"June 12, 2018",3,Reward dollars Walmart has initiated this app to keep their prices lower than their competitors which the whole point was for the customer to have an extra incentive to buy from Walmart and also for Walmart to always have lower prices than the competitors. But.....again Walmart has won and now you don’t rack up the reward dollars like you used to. I spent $600-$1000 per month and would get a substantial amount accumulated and I would save it up and I would purchase a big item. I have used it toward a $70 iron to a $250 pool. I enjoyed scanning my receipts....waiting to see how much I was going to get in return.....then deciding how long I wanted to accumulate them. Now.... Not so much now .....  I still spend the same amount and in the past eight months I have only accumulated $7.89 🤗.  Not much of an incentive to drive out of my way to a Walmart so I can save a dollar or two and then get to scan my receipt and then see that I didn’t even have any qualifying items.  I will just support my small businesses because at least I know that all the registers will be open.....the employees will be friendly.....and the owners will desperately appreciate my business.

My husband had to take over a year off work as I was too disabled to care for the kids, especially the 3 & 5 year olds. Our closest Wal-Mart is a 20 minute drive from our house. My husband & I would both make the drive specifically for Savings Catcher. With such a large family we obviously purchase a lot of food, toiletries, household items, clothes etc."
10,Michelle & Christopher,"April 12, 2018",3,Walmart pay won’t work for security reasons??? !? I never write reviews but I came to look at the reviews to see if anyone else has the same problem turns out yes they do! I too have had Walmart savings catcher and the Walmart pay for forever now. I’ve loaded hundred of dollars of gifts cards with no issue. Until the other day it’s declined for security reasons?? Use another payment. There’s plenty of money on there in e gift cards. Nobody in store or the 800 number knows anything multiple people in store and multiple transfers to departments at the 866 number and the end result was they will get back to me in 3-5 days by email with tech support! Reallly!!?? There’s no one to talk to? No one to rectify this now? Nobody to transfer to a tangible gift card so I can use it? I love my Walmart pay but now this has really put a wrench in my Walmart shopping. Come on Walmart there must be a better way ! why does nobody have an answer? Another solution they gave was to print the gift card and they can scan it. I sure hope that works although It really defeats the whole simplicity of Walmart pay😔 I’m so disappointed!!!
11,SuzanneAZ,"June 15, 2018",3,Educate the Employees Between my husband and I we shop at Walmart 4-5 times a week for our growing family. We both use the app and savings catcher to help manage all of our receipts and to stay on budget for the month. 
12,Noodledoodle5,"November 10, 2018",2,See the stars falling off soon Hate the new system. It’s not like Walmart’s have WiFi. And most Walmart’s have really bad signals! Can’t bring up savings catcher/Walmart pay if you can’t get a signal to do so. 
13,HombreDeAcero,"November 28, 2018",1,"App and store don’t work well together for returns. I made a purchase using Walmart pay and all seemed good though I wish it would print a physical receipt. The big issue was when I had to make a return. I started my return on the app as it supposed to make things easier. When I get to the counter the lady is asking me why I’m returning for each item even though I answered all that on the app. Not only that but I had so wait and watch her open each and every single item. Once she finished she said I was getting a gift card. I said excuse me no. I used my card with ur app to pay I’m not accepting a gift card. She gets her lead who is rude and says the same thing and all she does is show me the screen that says gift card. I told her again I’m not accepting a gift card and she said it’s not our app. That’s why we don’t accept returns with purchases made using Walmart pay. I told her, Walmart owns the app and you work for Walmart and represent Walmart therefore you are Walmart and this is your app. Long story short I had to get two other managers before someone could figure out what to do. Not sure how this app is suppose to make things easier or faster but I’ll tell u that returns line only got longer while I waited to resolve my issue. Hate Walmart."
14,Erotichotx3,"November 30, 2018",2,"New changes results in tons of lost savings This USED to be a great app to get the most out of your money. Submitting a receipt was super easy, and the process took less than 2 minutes. Now, you have to use Walmart pay which I’m sure has caused a ton of people to stop using the app altogether. Along with that, if you receive SNAP benefits, you can’t add your EBT card as a method of payment. Clearly the people using snap benefits needs the rewards/savings just as most if not more to maximize purchases. I had a lot of fun using this app before they switched it but unfortunately I do not feel comfortable linking my debit cards to pay at checkout, and I have to primarily rely on SNAP benefits at the time being to provide food for my family. I really hope Walmart steps up because that is discrimination towards people in poverty and members of the lower working class. Shame on them. A simply solution would be any savings rewarded from a purchase using EBT can only be redeemed for food items. Surely with the money Walmart makes they can afford to upgrade the platform to allow such purchases via this app. I’ll check back in a few months to see if they’ve worked this muck out. Disappointed!"
15,...kab,"December 14, 2018",2,"Savings catcher update.... I LOVED the old savings catcher program before October 28. I’m still one of those people who uses cash quite a bit, and to longer be able to put in my receipts for my cash purchases is so disappointing. I actually looked forward to putting in my receipts after each trip, and it was fun to watch my rewards add up over time. It gave me a incentive to shop there. I think in the past few weeks I’ve been to Walmart at least 4 times a week, paid with cash, and have a stack of receipts I can’t even put in Savings Catcher. I know everyone will say to just deposit my cash and use my debit card, but I’ve just always used cash, and our Walmart has some cash only registers that are quicker to get through. Also, with 5 daughters, it’s sometimes a hassle to deposit my cash, then go shopping, and to get my phone out and do the whole Walmart pay thing. On one of my visits, it froze up the whole self-check register and I had to re-ring my whole purchase at another register. Plus, using cash keeps me on a budget, and it’s just what I prefer. I wish you would consider bringing back the option to enter cash purchase receipts."
16,Very frustrated mom to be,"January 28, 2019",2,"Just save the trouble and use Target Creating a baby registry on this app is a NIGHTMARE. I’ll start by saying that it’s very frustrating that the registry is not a separate app from the rest of Walmart shopping (like Target does), because it makes navigating back and forth to your registry SUPER inconvenient. Anyways, when first creating your registry, your first and last name is required, which is understandable, however, it will not let you create a custom name for the registry itself. So, you can’t match the name to any other registries you’ve created for your shower. Then, before you even get to look at any items for yourself, it adds a long list of things it “thinks” you may want instead of just suggesting them to you(LIKE TARGET DOES). Oh, but it doesn’t even end there! If you don’t like the certain brands of wipes/diapers, or prints of clothing it has chosen for your child, you’ll have to go through a 2-3 step process for EACH item to remove it from your registry. Not to mention, half the things it added to the list are out of stock! If I had not already put on my invitations that I am registered through Walmart and Target, I would delete this registry altogether. Complete headache."
17,@zeus,"February 22, 2019",2,Needs to show everything not half the items When you try to find things in the store or scan things that are in the store because you just bought it and you want to buy more but your home not at the store it acts like it can’t find it or it’s not there even though if you go down to the store you can find it but it will show you the item that cost more so if I wanted to preset a few things for walmart and pick it up I wouldn’t be able to because according to the app Walmart don’t carry it but I can go to walmart look right at it and what do you know it’s there plus I can scan it to price check it or order it then and with the same app it then shows that’s it’s at walmart. 
18,Heathen101,"December 11, 2019",1,"Invasion of Pivacy! Walmart uses this app to SPY on you and here is how: every time you take your phone with this app downloaded in their store and you check out at all their self checkouts they have now and the cameras is A.I. Facial Recognition software and then send you SPAM Surveys for Walmart Gift-card “drawings”, you get your private information sold by the Waltons to 3rd party scam artist and they start calling you all day long (hundreds of calls in a month)! Total invasion of privacy and they illegally stop customers from Open Carry in Open Carry States, soon they will stop Conceal Carry and shopping will be like a Gangster’s Paradise for the Crinimals (100% unsafe to shop). I don’t like my face being recorded and my picture and personal information to include home address to be SOLD to more CROOKS aka SCAM ARTIST! It’s NOT RIGHT! "
19,Marcie H.,"August 22, 2019",3,"BRING BACK SAVINGS CATCHER!!! I’m EXTREMELY disappointed that you took Savings Catcher away!! It was a truly wonderful system that GUARANTEED I did absolutely ALL of my shopping at Walmart! After experiencing only a couple of minor user issues, I had no problems or complaints and managed to get back OVER $100 IN SAVINGS!! Because I usually had anywhere from $3-$10 in S.C. money available on my WalMart account, whenever there was an emergency of some sort that left our checking account empty, I was still able to make essential purchases (such as MILK, BREAD, TP, etc.) to get my family through till payday! More than ONCE we were able to manage thanks entirely to the S. C. program and I’ve heard similar stories from friends who also utilized it. I was therefore SHOCKED and DISMAYED when I was told that the program had been terminated and no one could explain why. Not only THAT but WalMart doesn’t even do PRICE MATCHING anymore! "
20,Photoamany,"October 27, 2017",2,Gets worse with each passing moment This was an awesome app when I first downloaded a couple years ago but as time goes by and changes evolve it gets more discouraging with each use. 
21,lynnkennerly,"November 15, 2017",5,Order pick up at store So I went to Walmart to see about an LOL toy. I ordered it for store pick up and when I went to see about it because I wanted to be sure my email was right the manager said yes and they did have one left but had not found it yet and would email me. Later I got email saying my order was cancelled because it was now out of stock. I feel they should of asked if I wanted it cancelled or kept it on file like a first come when they did get a shipment. Not to mention my bank still shows this as a pending transaction and if I understand right I will have to check with my bank on this. Also for several times they say stores around me have limited or in stock on this item . I checked with at least three stores and they never even got any unless store employees got them first. I feel as though I should be given priority since I even had been given a confirmation number in the first place. 
22,Hogmanmike,"February 14, 2018",1,"App very slow to log in I have always had issues with the time it takes to log in to savings catcher. The developer help is worthless. They just keep sending me emails saying  “my account is locked”. Even after deleting and reinstalling the app, it’s a little faster but not much. Tried an additional time to reinstall after talking with tech support on the phone, made sure my account was not blocked, now it says”oops, something went wrong, please try back later”. I deleted the app."
23,Ahstewie,"May 3, 2018",5,"Great hidden features Sometimes you find you can benefit from an app, I recently switched to using just mobile data which means large apps and updates sometimes don’t happen, normally that would mean a visit to my local Apple store 50 mile round trip or Starbucks and buy a coffee just to go the updates."
24,HyruleHobbit,"May 25, 2018",5,"Fantastic!! I use this app only to scan my receipts after checking out from Walmart.  Once I scan it takes a day or two to let me know if they located any stores with a less expensive price on the products I bought.  If so, the extra amount from what I spent at Walmart goes into my Walmart pay.  I can either use this at Walmart or redeem it for Cash.  I tend to collect quite a bit from this. I’ve gotten back around $40 so far.  I would have let this slip through my fingers!!  Sure, a ton of stores price match BUT!!!!! When those stores price match they give you the discount then and there.  This app located the difference and gives you the money, which is welcome near the end of a pay week.  Not only that but the app has different features, along with ordering online, ordering by scanning things on the barcode scanner (participating locations) and other stuff.  I love this app!"
25,Mom2twinz2,"May 26, 2018",5,Great app- I still don’t understand why Savings Catcher doesn’t price match with Walgreens! The store employees seem to think it does automatically pricematch with Walgreen but advertised prices

One would think that with all the money that Walmart Grapevine rakes in every minute of every day, they could afford to turn on the air conditioning & keep its customers comfortable during their shopping experience....but NO & NOT A CHANCE!  Every summer this store is hotter than hell, to the point of being unbearable, and when you address the matter with Store Management as we have many a time, we are always told that they have broken units & they are being fixed. Nope, not buying that lousy excuse again.  Walmart Grapevine has figured out that most customers will shop there anyway because of pricing & they can save tons of money by operating this store with fewer air conditioning units turned on!"
27,I_Blonde,"June 6, 2018",5,"Great except for one tiny thing Purchase history no longer has the option to save a receipt directly to iPhone camera roll. This was a very convenient feature that had been present for some time, and I would just like to see the option be reinstated."
28,Mumof06,"November 8, 2018",1,"Going to shop elsewhere! This used to be my favorite app and store to shop at. I even drive pretty far from my home to do my shopping. However, you have ruined this app. I have 4 receipts that I can’t upload because you have to use Walmart pay to load your receiptsat the time of purchase. So this takes the way I choose to save and pay out of my hands and gives it to you. Also, often times my husband will stop at night on his way home from work to pick up a few things and I can’t add those either. This app was pretty much the reason I’d go out of my way to shop at Walmart. I drive by a target, bakers, aldi, Whole Foods, and hyvee to shop at Walmart. I would also wait until my savings added up to a certain amount and then use it, if you’re forcing me to pay with the app, than it will use up my gift card each time. Making it feel like I’m not saving at all. Last thing, I have 7 kids, one is 3 months old, I don’t want to fuss with a phone while I’m trying to pay. Not everyone has their phone out all the time. This is very disappointing, I guess I’ll be doing the research for a lower price and shopping elsewhere now."

30,AEbabe007,"January 21, 2018",3,"App Getting Worse I used to love this app. I mostly used it for the savings catcher, but occasionally would search for items to order online or for birthday party decoration planning. Now I usually can't search for items without an error which causes me to just go to the website. And for the past few updates, I've noticed that the app is not connecting to the internet. It doesn't matter if I'm on my wifi or using my phone's provider network, it doesn't work. The only way I can use the app is if I am at a Walmart, on their wifi. So if I forget to add my receipt to the savings catcher as soon as I check out, then I will not be able to add it. Usually by the time I'm back at the store is one week later and because you can't add the receipt 7 days later, you lose out. Anyone else having this problem? Last week, I forgot to charge my phone before I left the house and my phone died while I was adding my receipt, so I'm sure it didn't go through. I'm getting extremely frustrated!"

I elected to go to the self scan kiosk , even though my car has was parked at the other end of the store.  There was no line and more than one open machine at self scan.  The young man on duty decided to burst my chops about using self scan, even though it was not busy.  When I asked where was the sign it was placed not outside but inside the area.  Also he watched me come into the area and waited until I was almost through check out before informing me I should have gone through the regular line.  If he had objections then he should have stopped me in the beginning before making my 38  items an issue.  If this is an issue Walmart should have had more than one open line so at 8:30 in the morning we are not waiting to check out.  I purposely went early to avoid Saturday lines.

The daily updates to the app notwithstanding; I can't seem to get Wal Pay to work. I already use my iPod to manage my shopping list, so that's how I access the app (just using Notes for my list). Last couple of tries at using Pay, my iPod crashed, the app drained my battery, I got a Low Battery warning, and it shut down completely. So, I tried not even looking at my list in Notes, logging into the app at checkout. Placed the iPod over the terminal and tried to get it to scan (just for good measure I was on your WiFi), and it didn't drain battery immediately but due to overhead glare I think it would not read.... and then battery drained. Tried this at home an it is the QR scan that is draining the battery. Never happened before the Catcher was deactivated, a few months ago I could use the QR on the receipt to process Savings Catcher. I hope this improves because Walmart is where I used to do all my shopping."

I try to avoid returning items because of how much hassle involved, but when I saw that I could fast track the process, I was excited because I had bought a couple of items that I ended up needing to return.  The first part of the process on the app was very easy.  Took the items to the store, only to find out that customer service was already closed for the day.  Left with the items, then over the course of the next week we found a use for the two items so now we are keeping them. Well, almost two months later, they’re still on my list as scheduled to be returned.  There should be a way to cancel these, but I have no idea how.

Making that a stepchild of the same app that sells lawn furniture and toilet paper did not work well. If you are used to “real” pharmacy apps, like Walgreens and CVS apps, you will be pulling your hair out. First, it took weeks for prescriptions that I had filled at Walmart - even those filled USING THIS APP to show up on the on-line account. I don’t know still if my history is showing in this app because it still won’t let me access Rx status or history because it doesn’t believe the birthday I am putting in apparently, even though I have confirmed with their pharmacy that they have my correct birthday in their system. In the app, I put my birthday in  whenever I have tried use it to check Rx history or status it says “Sorry, we are having trouble with your request. Please try again later.”  I have tried many “laters” to no avail. So, as a result, I have only been able to use the app to transfer prescriptions or refill them using the Rx number.

40,sym41,"June 18, 2018",1,Savings catcher account It is a good thing but before they changed things they had moved 70 plus dollar to a ecard that I never could figure out how to use and then when they changed things I never got it back in my account nor do I know what happened to it my account has been messed up then I bought some stuff online for Christmas but they had me go to the third party they had on the site and I never got what I ordered which was some jeans and I called the other place which was some Chinese people and they took my information and I have called and called but they always say a ticket put in and will call back here it is June that was December I guess I am just out of my money without anything I bought smh. Walmart I had many problems ordering ex specially during Christmas I ordered a PlayStation and then right before they shipped it is said no longer in stock when they first said in stock . I am having a hard time wanting to shop cause when I do things get screwed up or like then my money was taken off my savings catcher account and it was less .
41,Free cell girl,"June 21, 2018",2,"Very unhappy shopper. You have taken out half of the checkout lanes and replaced them with self checkout lanes. I do not have a debit card for my checking account. That means I can not write a check for my groceries at the self checkouts. So I have to stand in line 15 or 20 minutes for a checkout line with a checker. I shop exclusively at Walmart because there is only two other places in London, KY.  And they are much more expensive. For me this is much much more inconvenient. I used to like Walmart, but honestly, I DESPISE it now. Every time I shop, there are several items they are out of or as they say “that has been dc’d.”  Meaning discontinued. The sales associates couldn’t care less. They are rude and very unhelpful. I have actually been told “I have no idea” when I have inquired about the location of a product. "

I called cust service on my multi products shipment of $85 said best they can do is offer some adjustment.. ready for this?... $4.86 cents. Really??  Cust service agent was good and compassionate but of course they're limited by company  policy. Good agent but great disappointment on walmart. This was a lesson learned and the prime company I've used will be getting my business again  because they DO live up to their promised delivery promise .. not a good impression walmart. Quite shameful. I had to send someone to get some of the needed items at a local drugstore and supermarket and it was a-lot more than your petty adjustment.

45,Mrs.Wright1227,"August 10, 2018",1,"If I must say. You know for as big as Walmart is and for as much as the company is worth, you would think the app would be one of the best apps out there. However that’s not the case.. It never has anything in stock. Yet, it displays that it does until you click on the item to find out the website has none available. The search capability is so unrealistic. You search for a clothing item and up pops cans of tomatoes. Also when you select to view in your “own” store the search find almost nothing.. Even though you were there yesterday and saw 20 of that item. In no way do I want to say negative things about Walmart. I live in a small town with very few options and Walmart has almost everything at a great price, even sale and clearance items. It’s just that knowing Walmart’s capacity and they shoot so low for the app. I know they can improve this times a 1,000 and I hope to see that they do.

46,Bill2go,"September 30, 2018",1,"Inability to scan paper receipts. I find the upcoming change to Savings Catcher to be insulting to loyal customers, such as myself, who use this feature. As of October 29, 2018, customers will no longer be able to scan their paper receipts to participate in Savings Catcher. Everyone must pay via Walmart Pay to participate in Savings Catcher. Clearly, this is another blatant and disgusting act of greed on behalf of Walmart to place an additional burdensome obstacle in the way of customers trying to cash in on a few pennies back for every shopping trip to Walmart stores. Walmart prices are already overly-expensive and overinflated as it is, but Walmart doesn’t let that curb their greed. What if a customer pays cash and doesn’t agree to being forced into using Walmart Pay? In that case, you’re ineligible to use Savings Catcher. Walmart really needs to focus more on better customer service in their filthy stores and out-of-stock merchandise than trying to find greedy little ways to make their customers pay more. This is another disappointing and pathetic move on behalf of Walmart. The greed is disgusting."
47,MrsFuquea,"November 3, 2018",1,"Completely unsatisfied The change to the Saving Catcher is very disappointing. You can only get savings now if you use Walmart Pay? Not everyone has or wants to use that. Secondly, are you employees not trained on how to bag the groceries? Since when do you put raw meat in the same bag as fresh produce? Or can food on top of fresh produce and/or bread products? Then there are the chemicals bagged here and there with other products. If you re-bag your groceries yourself then the cashiers want to be belligerent and rude. Then there are 20 some odd registers and never more than 4 open during peak time. I’ve tried being patient and understanding yet it just gets worse each trip. I’ve only been a handful of times this past month by shopping elsewhere. This requires an additional 30 minute drive and at times two stops, but I’m okay with that. I’ve certainly not experienced as many panic attacks just trying to by groceries because people are rude and inconsiderate. I hope you correct your negatives or you will loose all your business to your competitors, not to mention hurt the local economy."
48,Blondie_40,"January 9, 2019",1,Do not get this App. Walmart is false advertising that they will match any price and give you the lower price. First they discriminate against those who can’t afford smart phones because they made you have to get a smart phone and use the app. To submit receipts. Those who do not have smart phones are no longer eligible for this savings. Now if you do not give them your credit card information and use the app. (Walmart pay) to pay for purchases you do not get the savings. Your advertisement should say that you only receive these savings if you have a smart phone to get the app and link your credit card to the account and pay with your smart phone Walmart pay app. to get the we match any lower price guarantee. We should not have to give you our credit card information or have a smart phone or pay with the app to access your advertisement. This is discrimination and false advertisement. There is no way I’m going to give my credit card information for another app and company to swear they will protect and then get a letter stating they have been hacked.

I actually shop at Walmart less now because of the changes. Before when I could any method of payment and know that savings catcher would search and give me the best price, I simply used Walmart as my primary shopping source. Now with the requirements of Walmart Pay it’s not worth the aggravation. The functionality of the process is slow, problematic and not shopper/customer friendly. Most times the cashiers can’t help because they don’t understand it either. Even our Walmart stores have gone down since all these changes started. Shelves are not stocked regularly, the pickup tower is a disaster, scan and go cashiers don’t regulate the registers and let people cut line and not say anything, the stores aren’t as organized and clean as they once were, the meat and produce areas are not kept fresh. I no longer buy fresh meat or fruit there. It’s really sad and disappointing."

My husband and I spend quite a bit of money at Wal-Mart and I’ve been using the app for several years now. My issue is that I would scan my receipts and his receipts as we don’t always shop there together. Now, I won’t be able to use his receipts because you have to use Wal-Mart pay and scan at the register when you check out. He doesn’t have the app and doesn’t intend on getting it either. Another issue is that our cell phone service isn’t the best in our local Wal-Mart. Often, if I want to use the app while in the store, it won’t work because of the poor reception. Also, if you’re in a hurry and forget to scan or if waiting several minutes for the app to open is not an option, then you just can’t use that receipt. I prefer the convenience of being able to put the receipts in my pocket and scanning them when I got home. Thanks for screwing up a good thing."

So when I asked what could help me to insure a less painful experience they suggested this app.  After struggling to get my account logged in, apparently I had set this up a while ago without remembering, I finally had access to the pharmacy section.  But I was unable to go any further.  It continues to say I must be logged in to access the pharmacy (which I clearly was).  After logging out and trying it again I had the same response.  I deleted and reinstalled the app to see if that would help, it did not.   So much for an easier way to fill my prescriptions and limit my wait time!  What a joke!!!

It was 6:30 till I got my order , my time was wasted trying to wait on a response and then an hour to bring it out ? During this time I saw one young man trying to take cate of all of this by himself , he was so overwhelmed , I felt so bad for him . Obviously it was high demand but , someone in management should have realized that and sent him some help ! I do not by any means blame the employee for the wait  time , I blame Walmart for showing no support of their workers or customers .

I have had terrible experiences at self check out due to lack of staff training. I constantly take longer in my shopping trip rather than bother an already over worked undervalued employee to help me. They will most likely be irritated by me or uneducated on where to actually go. They will not take me to what I am looking for they will just give me vague directions because they can’t leave their area. But you’re Walmart and you’re too big to fail so I don’t know why you even ask for feedback. You won’t increase your employees wages or hire more staff so that everyone can be happy at work and make your customers happy. Your profits will never waiver because you will always be there to provide the cheapest prices for people in poverty. You will always be able to offer the cheapest prices because you pay for the cheapest labor.

No thank you! I had the wrong card tied in when I went to cash out. A CSM helped me set it to use my savings only, but it used the card anyway! What if that card was almost maxed out and I got an overage charge for their app error? I quit this ever changing app! Plus, you know, if they really wanted to stay the most competitive for customers, they would scan and set it daily for everyone, not just those using the app. Furthermore, when I lived in Little Rock with 3 stores, you could find different prices for the same item at each.

Walmart used to do a much better job with their price matching and customer service, but I cannot give them a good rating any longer. I spoke to their customer service about this and they simply said that if their system doesn’t find the sales price then they cannot match it. They will not try to look into the problem, they just tell you they cannot give you the credit. I can’t believe that they don’t even have items on the front page of their competitors weekly ad pages being matched with their savings catcher system anymore. Remember, if you want the sales price, you MUST visit the store that is offering the sales price. Do not rely on this app to find all of the sales prices for you or you will be very disappointed ☹️"

Today when I went to submit the receipt it just says error and shows no history of me purchasing anything. Went to customer service to ask about it and no one seems to know what’s wrong. Had to get them to look up the register that I checked out on to print me a paper receipt that I still can’t submit to savings catcher.

They don’t pay thier employees a living wage or healthcare. when Walmart  moves into your town thier business plan is to undercut the prices of all the competitors in the area until thier out of business then they raise thier prices because they are the only store in town you can go to. They destroy mom and pop businesses everyday. Also they rely on the federal government to pay for thier employees healthcare. I would love to see Walmart put up a statistic showing how many of thier work force receive public assistance just to make ends meet.a huge population of  the working poor. That is what Walmart has to offer America. We need to boycott these greedy billionaires out of our country. This is far from what Sam Walton had in mind people. Corporate greed.

It’s been my life saver in many occasions especially since I live on a tight budget right now. If you shop at Walmart often I definitely recommend this app. The savings may not be a whole lot at a time but after a while they do add up. I’ve used it for so long it’s like second nature to me now to add my receipts as soon as I get home.

HOWEVER, the app was personally ruined for me after they decided to remove scanning paper receipts for savings after paying. People forget to scan at the counter or sometimes don’t bring their phone into stores, making them unable to do something they would gladly do if they didn’t forget. Also, Walmart may not realize that there are customers with anxiety and try to get in and out of the store ASAP. Said customers don’t have the time to pull out their phone, especially in stores with bad internet, to try to scan their barcode and be in the store any longer/ or try to fumble around and freak out if the scan doesn’t work in store. That leads to giving up for searching for savings, which is the biggest reason I’m sure most people have this app. "

If I’m looking for an ingredient I want it now, not in 2-5 business days. I wish they would also refer to items they do carry in story by aisle number like Target does.

Wegmans app gives a very close estimate of what items that are charged per/weight.  Walmart’s app just adds the item to your cart with no price at all.  I was going to compare chicken prices.  Wegmans app has their family pack listed as “1.99/lb (about 4.5lbs per pick)”.  I can sit at home and make my list with them and get a pretty good idea of about how much I will be paying at the register.  The most the difference has ever been is $12.  But I can control that by looking for packages that weigh closer to their estimate.  If I could find out how much I could save at Walmart I would probably bring my business there.

Recently, the app has deleted one of my prescriptions without my knowledge and without notifying me of the “change of prescription number” that would allow me to refill through the app. Now I am off schedule for my medication AND I will have to spend an hour of my time that I don’t have to stand around and refill my medication at the pharmacy."
80,silent foamingo,"June 8, 2018",5,"Awesome App This App. Is so easy to use. I enjoy the savings catcher. Not only does it keep copies of all my receipts in one location, but the rewards help my budget. I know that if something is a lesser price somewhere else, I will get that difference back. No worries and no price matching. Also, the site to store shopping has no charges hidden, like some other stores...I can order special items in the right sizes, colors, etc. without running around searching. Best of all, I can pick up those items when I come I. For my groceries. New lower prices in the store, especially dairy have me actually staying and doing all my shopping. Finally, I don’t have to go to five stores any longer. This App helps me every step of the way. It’s so easy to navigate."
81,Baddadash,"September 8, 2018",5,"Shopping made easy It doesn’t matter what you need, Walmart will most likely have it. The convenience of online grocery shopping has now been added to the list of services they provide and it is easily making them the ""1 stop shop"" for everything. Sitting down with my family and planning your grocery shopping is fun and easy, simply drive up the next day and they put it in your car. Today the service is free and has changed many people’s lives. With all of these things, Walmart adds professional world class customer service to all of its services. I have never encountered a legitimate issue that wasn’t resolved perfectly. Thank you Walmart for making my life easier and saving me money."
82,Oldplayer1,"October 19, 2018",2,"New changes Ok so beginning in late October we must use Walmart pay to submit a receipt to savings catcher We’ll in my Walmart that’s not possible we have no connection with the metal roof it makes it hard to even sign in on the app and the WiFi in the store is horrible, so I guess some app users in my area is no longer going to be able to participate "
83,TheTalentedMrJ,"October 30, 2018",1,"Savings Catcher - from hero to zero One of the highlights of the Walmart app has been the Savings Catcher feature.  It allowed you to scan your receipt and the app would compare competitors prices and if it found a lower price, the difference would be credited to your account.  The app will still do this, but unfortunately Walmart has now completely tied it into their Walmart Pay feature.  Meaning the only way you can use Savings Catcher is if you use Walmart Pay to checkout.  For families or those of us whose spouses are less digitally inclined, this means you can no longer scan their store receipt after they’ve gone shopping without you and add it to Savings Catcher.  You must be there to use Walmart Pay (which doesn’t always work correctly or cashiers seemed confused by).  What may seem like a small change to Walmart in order to drive customers to use the Walmart Pay function is a major factor on why my family and I may be shopping there less."
84,Dmm1384,"November 3, 2018",2,Change Back Savings Catcher! I’m not sure what you guys were thinking when you decided to change the savings catcher option in your app. Making people use credit/debit/gift card at the register to get money back from savings catcher is RIDICULOUS! Some people prefer having paper receipts and being able to pay cash at the register. This change makes no sense. Also now you can’t scan your Walmart receipts in others savings apps like Ibotta since you need a physical receipt to do that. So now your making people chose how to save money. I loved the app and savings catcher before and had no problem with using Walmart pay to cash in on your savings catchers savings. Instead of the whole transfer to gift card. But to not allow people to scan their physical receipts is wrong and needs to change. I will not use this app till things change. What exactly were you thinking Walmart?
85,Coach Sheri :),"November 7, 2018",3,"Stock issues Love the app when it works, but it's definitely a gamble as to whether your items are actually in-stock or not. Several times, I've ordered items through the app or online, only to have them cancelled by WM because they weren't actually in-stock. What's even more irritating is that the cancellation usually happens on the day the item should be delivered. As a matter of fact, Monday I purchased 6 boxes of carpet tiles...each listed for 2-day shipping. The app shows 2 boxes being delivered today...the other 4 boxes are still showing as 'preparing to ship'...though they should ALL be delivered today. I won't be surprised if those 4 are cancelled soon because they probably aren't actually in-stock. This will be a further inconvenience because I will have to return the 2 boxes I am receiving today, as they are useless without the other 4 boxes.😠"

88,Itbritneyb!!!,"October 3, 2019",1,Total waste of time!!!! This app makes zero sense to me! I’m hoping someone will see this and make a change!!!! So you can walk through the store scan an item & it will say out of stock or not available in your store while you are literally holding the Item in your hand. So ok I work around this by just scanning the next item I have on my list & hope it allows me to put it in my cart so once I have the items I go to checkout only to find out I can’t leave with everything I just scanned it’s either for pick up which is the service where the store does your shopping & brings it out to you or delivery service. Why in the world would I want items I already have in my possession delivered to me by mail days later????????? Had I known it was this ridiculous I would have brought my wal mart card instead of leaving it at home & trusting the app. No other means to pay so I had to leave my cart full of items there and walk out. So ridiculous

Someone had already gotten it! When I made the order I made sure I said no one but me could pick it up! I don’t know how anyone could have gotten my tracking number or my email address! I was so confused! If I said nobody but me to pick it up. Then that was supposed to happen! And I feel like they should always ask for ID! It’s scammers out here. And I feel like Walmart should protect its customers! In my case the Walmart manger said that the the employee did everything right! I called the Walmart Customer Service number and they said they would issue me a refund! I will never do in store pick up again!"

Then I scan my receipts in and wait for the rewards to show up. It’s not a TON but in the month and a half to 2 months I’ve started using the savings catcher I’ve gotten just over $5 back in savings, which I’m happy to take when it’s so easy. I’ve also done in store pick up, they make that a breeze (I do recommend having special parking spots for in store pick up only if your store doesn’t already deliver to cars). Also being able to search for an item and see the availability in all the stores around you is great. I love this app!"
91,Momwithlittlepeople,"April 9, 2018",1,"Savings catcher is a joke They advertise that they are going to stop price matching in stores but this app is a great way to continue to do it for store credit.  I was leery but I tried it and it seemed to be going good.  I had accumulated over $40 by last October when I first transferred to a gift card. About 5 months time from when I started using it. Shortly after I got the notice about them putting them on the card on their own.  Weird but whatever.  However in February, despite continuing to download every single receipt, and getting email after email that “lower prices were found”, my card balance had not changed from the balance I had left from the original card that I had spent half of on an online order.  I emailed them repeatedly with no response so they clearly do not care that it isn’t giving me my savings back.  So I stopped using it in Feb.  I come back after every update to see if they have fixed it, but nope."
92,amy1942,"June 14, 2018",2,"When it works.... it’s still annoying This app used to be good for the savings catcher but as others have mentioned, they are about two weeks behind in reviewing receipts which is super annoying when they used to take two days. Also, I have tried to use the Walmart pay and beware! They don’t give you a paper receipt. It wasn’t even an option! So for everyone who uses the grocery apps that require a paper receipt, you cannot use Wal-Mart pay. You would think it would be an option to get an e receipt or a paper receipt. Every other store that I’ve encountered that gives e receipts asks you if you want one. Then we get to the issue that Walmart pay is extremely unreliable and often doesn’t work at all, claims your card is declined and closes. Then you use the exact same card to pay and it works just fine. What a complete waste. This app definitely needs work"

I just had total knee replacement surgery so I was looking for something like this to help me out.  It couldn’t have been easier and I couldn’t have been happier!!

94,Leprelevement,"November 9, 2018",1,"Walmart Pay My wife and I both use the Walmart app and love that it is great for most of its intended use. That being said, this app is worthless when it comes to Walmart Pay. When my wife started using it over a year ago, she loved it! Forgot her card somewhere and didn’t have to leave the items behind just to come back and shop again. Unfortunately that has changed a lot over the past year. Today I attempted to use this feature and the issue wasn’t the app. The issue is the store. They blamed the systems multiple failures on incoming weather.  The forecast is set for cold temperatures, not a storm system. No rain in the forecast for 4 days... All I wanted was to buy some baby formula and they wasted 20 minutes of my time trying to get their system to work, only to tell me that I couldn’t complete the transaction. I get that I should have been prepared with cash or a card, but they don’t support Apple Pay, so they get one star."
95,kimmi3_,"February 2, 2019",2,"Hate it It’s useful if you’re looking up items or don’t want to walk to find a price scanner. Even then, sometimes it doesn’t work. What I loved about it was for the Savings Catcher. However, now you have to use Walmart Pay to submit any receipts to Savings Catcher. I don’t always have money in my cards so I can’t always use Walmart Pay. Many times, I have cash and when I do use cash, I buy a lot, but it won’t let me submit it. Now, it’s an inconvenience. There should be an option to do both. I tried scanning my receipts through Walmart Pay but it didn’t take. I knew but didn’t hurt to try. That’s the only reason I’m giving it only two stars. I was going to give it one star but it is useful when I need to look something up. Even then, I don’t use it often. Thinking about uninstall it. The purpose I installed it for isn’t there anymore, which was to submit receipts to Savings Catcher."

At least 3/4 items come up every four or five times. So you go past 10 items, then 3/4 items come up again. Those repeat for about 20 items, then it changes to start repeating another 3/4 for 20 times etc. I get so frustrated trying to browse I often just give up!  There is no reason for items to constantly repeat, no other app I shop from does this.  Also no reason to keep showing the items in all colors. Once with color options is the normal for well designed apps "

Also it’s hard to find your lists as it’s in the section called “services” which is an odd name for anything to be classified under within the app. The features in searching “your store” is difficult as an item will pop up as in store but it’s actually not in store, it can be shipped to store, which is of no use to me if I’m in store or looking for the item to be in store. Also it is not up to date. A lot of items in store are not listed in the app at all or listed as in store but not. "

I tried scrolling through Halloween costumes but every time I clicked on something and tried to go back to scrolling it takes me back to the top of the page which is very annoying cause I had already scrolled down quite a ways and lost my place. So now I’m going to buy a costume from Target cause their all doesn’t do that. Also,  I do not like how some third-party sellers try to sell Disney toys like Doc Mcstuffins for prices like $126 for a simple doctor bag and some toys to go along with it. I hate going in the store because it’s always packed, the employees are rude, and I don’t like the other people who shop there. I thought that if I could use the app and get things delivered to me then it would be fine and it has  worked a few times but if it’s getting too frustrating to scroll and search then I might as well stick to Target. So long Wal-Mart I have no idea how you guys stay afloat but it certainly won’t be with my money."
99,Ojmom5,"July 6, 2019",1,Pharmacy I have been dealing with Walmart for over 5yrs in Pharmacy. The year 2019 has been completely unsatisfactory in getting prescriptions filled through their app. You must do orders now with 72-48hours in advanced then you still have to wait on prescription. You received notification that presentation is due for refill and it’s 3+ days to get your monthly medications. Then there is a problem if you send refill order in too SOON?!? They have change in staffing and or under staffed. I even waited 3 days to wait on a prescription and was first told they didn’t have it on stock and it would have to be ordered. Then they call me and tell me that their manufacturer was what currently producing the medicine at this time. So  they checked with other Walmart that was completely out of my way and a total inconvenience for me as a customer. Why have the app if you still have to call or just go to the pharmacy and see what the problem is with your refill??
100,MammerSlammer,"March 26, 2018",5,"Terrible app You literally cannot find anything. One second it says something is at our store and they have 15 items, our store is 5 minutes away so we go. We get there and Lo and behold, the item is not in stock. This has happened on several occasions. Not to mention savings catcher as well,... terrible. We started using it about 3 years ago and we were getting back close to 10 bucks every time. Just this past year none of our receipts process, and when they do they can take up to a week. By then sales have shifted and the items we purchased to compare were not comparable anymore. We didn’t even make a dollar back last year."

I used to take a paper list with me when I would remember it, but I’ve started entering items on my phone in this app because I always have my phone with me. I can even get an idea what my total cost will be (if I stick to the list...but that’s a different issue LOL).One thing that would make it even better would be to be able to sort my list by aisle. If I have selected a product that is at my store and is in stock it gives the aisle/location so why not be able to sort it that way so I don’t miss anything on my list?!"

Once I started and had a few items scanned and placed in the app cart I figured out it was only placing items that could be used with the scan & go. So that was no help but entering an item to look up where it is located I liked. Don't have to walk the store over which is great for me as I have severe back issues.

He went shopping when I was sick and came back and instead throwing away gave me the receipt because he knew I used the saving catcher. Well I can’t now because it has be scanned at the register when you checkout which not only if you don’t have a phone with app to scan you also got hold up the line and wait on app load before can scan. I’ve been with a friend who does it and yes the app will sit and spin waiting while line is long and few people in line is making rude remarks about this.

You shouldn’t have to navigate around the world to submit a receipt for the savings catcher.  Then when you go to scan a receipt it takes forever for the scanner to open up. The store I go to never has more than 2 registers open and no matter how many people in line they still don’t open one.  I still remember the old ads that said if there’s more than 3 people in line we’re going to open another line.  The items on the shelf are never rotated.  We keep finding stuff over a year out of date.  When you call the manager of the store they don’t seem to care.  I shop at the Walmart in central sc and if other stores had as cheap of prices I wouldn’t go there at all
122,me@me,"April 5, 2018",5,Very helpful! Walmart is the only grocery store in our town. I discovered that this app will tell you exactly what aisle an item you are trying to find in a store is located! Because of location manager it knows what store you are in and keeps track of where everything is! I use this feature ALL the time!
123,Brand_On1974,"July 14, 2018",5,"Brandon Boyd Review Walmart is my go to store, from the pharmacy to produce and back again. The Walmart app is a great addition to the already excellent service. Having the app on my iPhone takes the guess work out of my shopping experience. By entering my home store, or by-using location services, I can easily find any items and it’s exact location. The savings catcher is another great addition to the Walmart shopping experience. By scanning my receipts, Walmart gives me the difference from any of their competitors, within 3 business days. Thanks to Walmart and the new and improved app, I always know I’m getting the best possible deal. Save money live better, the Walmart guarantee."
124,GWSmith,"November 15, 2018",5,"Bring back scanning your receipt Why mess with a good thing? Not everybody can pay (or will pay) with their phones. I’ll just put it simply bring back the savings catcher everyone can use, without paying with your phone, or I’m going to target. The red card simple and easy to use and you don’t need your phone to operate it plus 5 percent back on everything you buy even on line, don’t have to worry about a worker going out an doing the comp pricing , like at Walmart, it’s everything, every time, ..... the editors note on Walmart is way behind..... my family of 5 doesn’t mind switching to target, and as a foot note it’s closer to my house. Winning!!!!!"

I use to be able to save money and use it later for big purchases or around Christmas time. Now, with everything done through the app, my husband has tried using app, since he is the one who shops the most at your store, with nothing but trouble! I made a past payment with a credit card, and y’all automatically put that card onto my account to pay future payments without my authorization 😡😡😡 Not cool, Walmart! I have figured out how to remove the card, but that is beside the point!!! Don’t think I will be using this app as much anymore. Sure wish y’all would give the option to either scan receipts or do automatically everything with Walmart Pay, then and only then will I return to using your app!"

I notice some of your employees get a little upset with certain types of people but at one point of my life I was one of those people you thought would never care either way. No way. Although you guys would get in trouble for helping these certain people that I can’t mention. You still allowed it. It helped me greatly. For that you have my business always. I appreciate your help.

127,1jaxsgirl,"April 26, 2020",1,Horrible new app This new app is a joke! It’s awful! It took over an hour to put my order in. Let’s go over the MANY issues:
128,JRenee67,"February 9, 2020",2,Bad app - Good people I wavered when giving stars for this app - just because I did get through to someone at the store finally (once I got the right phone number) who was very patient and helpful.
129,Bhs2007,"April 20, 2020",1,Pathetic U better off going into the store to buy your items period. When u order something for it to be shipped to your house they take eternity to charge you then they ship your item .. Sounds good right ? No.. why cause for example if u have 500 bucks on your card and u ordered something for 300 bucks u better not spend NO MORE money after that cause they will send u a verification number that your order was confirmed but they take an extra two more days or 4 to actually ship your item then they charge u. The shipping has a fee so u better not buy nothing else or order anything else off your card after u made your order. Y’all Remember the “won’t ship your item until u pay for it first “ well with Walmart u can cancel that. Last Don’t do the “pick up at store” orders cause it takes them 3 or more hours to actually have your item ready for pick up.

My kids used to take me and pick me up but I would take so long they told me if I wanted to go for me to get a driver’s license. I did one better than that.

Then her comes the best part. I register my receipt on the Walmart app. Then they check around for a lower price and if they find one I get the difference. It pays (literally) to shop Walmart.

132,Great security,"June 17, 2018",2,"Not dependable on getting grocery items I used to love Walmart, but since the last year or two have been unable to get simple items like Florida’s Natural no pulp orange juice, Hood chocolate non fat frozen yogurt, Folgers decaffeinated coffee, Pepperidge farm 45 cal oatmeal bread, garlic salt, Pepperidge farm marble rye bread, etc.  I can never rely on Walmart to have the items to make my meals."
133,Kroget,"June 20, 2018",1,"Disappointed Since Walmart “upgraded” their app I have had difficulty scanning my receipts. I know someone in corporate will try to place blame on my Phone or some operator error, but my problems did not start until the upgrade. First whenever I scan a receipt, 90% of the time I get an error message that there are difficulties and I have to manually put in the the TC# That’s fine, but the whole reason for an app in convenience. Second, I am getting email messages that say my receipt is invalid this happens constantly. I will check the TC # provided in my message against the TC# on my receipt and the # is the same. There is some avenue to take to dispute this but again where is convenience in that. Before I scanned my receipt and that was it. Now I have to put in the 21 digit # wait for the message that says it is invalid and dispute that claim.  I believe that I will just start shopping at Kroger."
134,Walsh8Family,"June 29, 2018",3,"Good not great As I have read on several other reviews, yes, Walmart takes too long to process receipts and misses many sale prices. If they would still do price match for people prepared to bring in other adds I wouldn’t complain but they won’t. And, my app only works for a couple of days at a time. I contacted customer service the first few times it stopped working and each time the first questioned they asked was if I had tried to uninstalled and reinstalled the app. So apparently they know there is an issue and that is the answer because it does work, but only for a few days and I have to do it again...not ideal. Basically it is a decent app but you need patience and if you want to guarantee you get a sale price on something, go where the sale is :/"
135,HeatherLandry,"December 2, 2018",3,"Where Do I Submit Receipts? When we first began using Walmart Pay, I would open Savings Catcher after my husband returned home with the groceries, and the receipts were shown there with the option to submit them for savings review. Now I can’t find that anymore. My receipts are all listed, but there’s no “submit” option. I’m very confused. I know it was there at the end of October, the last time I remembered to submit a receipt. "
136,Steelo703,"March 25, 2019",1,"Was great but now... They are getting rid of savings catcher? That was the best thing about the app.  As it is, I have to travel past the 2 Walmart’s closest to me to shop because the prices in the stores near me are ridiculously high.  For example, a gallon of milk was priced at $3.33 and $3.39 at each of the 2 closest Walmart’s. The price at the 3rd closest was $1.89 on the same day. The stores are less than 10 miles apart.  I can understand some minor price differences but this is totally unacceptable.  "
137,CJ-C,"October 6, 2019",1,"Frustrating App The app’s simple design would be great if it worked right. When you scroll, it’s supposed to load more results but instead just loads the same items you already saw. And if you click on an item and go back it takes you back up to the top of the results. Frustrating when you scrolled quite a ways down. Also, the inventory is never up to date. I’ll click on a size and then it’ll say out of stock. Click on the other sizes just to see and every size is out of stock. So why even have it on the site? Also, returning an online order isn’t always easy. Because the barcode from online items doesn’t always scan right in store. Even with the receipt I have a hard time getting the cashier to do the return because the item doesn’t scan right even though it clearly matches the description and item on the app."
138,Pin-maniac,"April 10, 2020",2,"Warning: There are irritating bugs/glitches The selections and offerings are great but the app can be extremely irritating to use.  There is an issue with the app crashing while in use on a fairly regular basis.  In addition, when you‘re searching the site, the app constantly resets to the beginning of your search query.  This glitch annoyingly takes you back to the start of any product search results and then you have to re-scroll through everything to get back to where you originally left off.  If this happened once in a while, that’d be one thing but the fact that it happens over and over again, is exhaustingly infuriating.  Honestly, this issue has literally caused me to just close the app and take my shopping elsewhere. Walmart...please fix this so I can search and shop in peace."
139,Magoodi,"March 31, 2020",5,"Ordering on-line What a disaster! My whole purpose for ordering on-line was to avoid being around people. I have been in the WalMart store more times, trying to get my order WHICH an email said was ready for pickup, and still only have pieces of my order. Every day I get the same email saying to pick up by April 1, but when I went to the “orange kiosk” ( sent there each time by “grocery” pick-up) they say I already picked it up!! I’ll try HyVee next time. I’ve wasted a lot of gas, a lot of my time. I will be 80 years old this Summer and have Asthma & nodules in my lungs. I tried to self quarantined but that did no good. I’m in WalMart more than ever on ordering on-line."
140,apthirdeye14,"March 22, 2018",2,"Assistant is annoying! It is very annoying to have to wait for the assistant to load when you open the app. I use Walmart Pay all the time. Having the assistant load before you can do anything REALLY slows down the checkout process. It’s so slow that it would be faster to pull my wallet out and just use my card. I was hoping that they would have fixed this issue in this last update, but it’s still there. I can’t understand why anyone would think it was a good idea to have that interface load up to let you know there’s an assistant before you can do anything. A mobile pay process is all about convenience and speed yet you have to wait for a graphic to load and tell you your assistant is ready before you can do anything. So dumb! Hopefully they can find a better way soon."

Well I have gotten smart enough to take a picture of what I get that is on sale. So I am checking out, of course an item, quantity of 4 came regular price. I asked for help, Tina came over and with a smile and patience she removed all 4 items. She got confirmation of the sale price and entered the correct price for me. BUT while doing this she made sure she thanked other customers without missing a lick. WOW, I will be coming to Walmart instead of Kroger just to see Tina for a few seconds.

Both Summerville locations, both GooseCreek locations and the one in North Charleston, South Carolina.  I’m tired of driving around town going to different stores looking for BlackBerry Clear American Ice waters. If Walmart is going out of business I understand but I think it’s just Bad store managers who don’t stock shelves properly. I would order multiple cases if they would allow it, but every store refuses. WHY? A family of 4 who drinks only plain water and the BlackBerry Clear I need TONS of it. Walmart either tell me you are discontinuing this item, allow me to order cases or stock your shelves! "
143,Fanmrfox,"December 26, 2018",3,Store Hours I liked the app quite a bit was easy to order things and all that but on Christmas Eve I showed up to get the things I ordered through the pickup part of the store and when I arrived to get them at 630pm i found out they were closed for the night and that they left at 3pm that day and the store itself closed at 630pm. The only way to have known that would have been to show up physically to Walmart where the hours were posted. The Application said the pickup was open that day from 8am-8pm and the store itself was open 24hrs. Nothing about My store advertised hours. I had to go buy all of my things at another retail brand that was thankfully open so I could have presents for my kids in Christmas Day. Other than that the app is okay.
144,OrangeBlossom627,"January 18, 2019",1,"Worthless App Now Unless you want to add your credit card or debit card to your account, the app is now useless. Does Walmart not realize that people are afraid of having their identity stolen, and don’t want to put their credit/debit information on every site/app, and have the chance it will be stolen? Also, not being able to scan your receipts would be fine.. but having to scan the machine inside Walmart is stupid, for the plain and simple fact that 9 times out of 10.. their WiFi doesn’t work right and doesn’t even bring the app up! I have brought this to their attention many many times.. I even offered them a solution of, why not let us type in our phone numbers... but, nooo. They just don’t want you to save money and want you to think you are... they want you to risk your debit/credit information being stolen as well!"

Please change this back, I can go to Kroger because it’s closest but I choose Walmart to actually see the savings. If I can’t see the savings then what’s the point of going out of my way? If it’s not broken, don’t fix it 🙄 "
146,Alauman,"March 3, 2019",3,"Sort & filter doesn’t work The sort & filter option on the app does nothing when I click apply. It goes back to showing everything. I don’t want to scroll through 116 items to find the brand that I want to order. If you have the sort & filter option, then make sure it works. What’s the point of using it if it just shows you all the brands because Walmart wants to try to sell you a different brand than what you at looking for. You should also have a complaint line or somewhere you can easily reach someone to make a complaint. I can’t find that option on the app or on the website. It only gives you an option for feedback when Walmart decides to send you an email after you order something."

I can probably get Walmart Pay to work 1 out of 10 times...if I’m lucky. So disappointed. Walmart, you know the old saying “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it”? Well whoever has these ideas for updates should think about the overall user experience."
148,DarkDoubleJ,"February 12, 2020",2,"Walmart Pay??? Saving catcher worked great. Then Walmart decided it was too easy. So they decided in order to use the savings catcher you have to use Walmart Pay. So reluctantly I started using Walmart pay. Ok it worked fine but I never got the savings that I did with Walmart pay. So then I guess that was too easy and they want to force us all into using their Walmart pickup. So now I go shopping and check myself out because they don’t want to employ People, the store is mostly self checkout. And the new update has taken away Walmart pay. In Order to use it you must order online. And while I do use Walmart pickup, I don’t like being forced to. I like to look around and pick things out. So originally I gave Walmart app a five star review when it was saving catcher but now 2 stars. Stop trying to make things better, your failing"

I totally get computer glitches and everything so I was calm. But when I went back in I had to wait 15 minutes just to have a 2 minute conversation. Let me also say there was many managers standing around talking about non work related things. Finally a worker came from the check out aisle that was working and came over. The other two managers that were just standing there walked away talking."

I am having a difficulty with my store being out of stock on items that are listed within the application as in stock and ready to pick up. This is happened to me almost every time I have shopped for my groceries With at least two items not being able to purchase the size that I wanted.  Since I live quite a distance from my Walmart store I do check to see if you have the essential items that I want to purchase before I come.

Our use RiteAid Pharmacy as well, their app is so simple, you open the app pharmacy right there you scan your pills you're done text me 30Seconds or less for Rite Aid RiteAid, Walmart takes me four minutes just for the whole process of one bottle alone.

However, I’m disappointed in the new update that removes the ability to submit receipts to the Savings Catcher if not using Walmart Pay. I also dislike the inability to accumulate your credits from the Savings Catcher if you’re using Walmart Pay. There is no option to defer using your Savings Catcher credits for a later purchase. The system wipes whatever you’ve accumulated first, and then you pay the remainder with cash or debit/credit card. I liked accumulating my Savings Catcher credits and using them for a large purchase.

Provide a way to filter by in stock items only (online or in store pick up). It is absolutely maddening trying to find out what I can actually purchase today either in-store or online. If I search for Lysol, disinfectant or antibacterial and you don’t have any of these items in stock- please just say so and stop showing a ton of things you carry but are currently unavailable. Listing items out of stock makes me think I can actually purchase and then I click through only to be disappointed. This wastes my time, then I waste more time coming here and complaining about it 😫"
169,Gina1836,"July 29, 2019",3,"Overall good, but navigating app is cumbersome A couple things about this app are super annoying and I keep thinking they’ll fix it eventually. First off, getting to the Walmart Pay screen to pay takes far too many screen selections.  After self checkout, it looks like you’re playing with your phone but you’re clicking through a maze of selections to get to Walmart Pay. Make a single, stand-alone icon for Walmart Pay rather than having to navigate through the app to get to arguably the most utilized part of the app. Second, finding the order status is so clumsy.  Account>purchase history>scroll around until you find it. Make this easier, instead of mixing online orders with in-store purchases."

171,Ozzcorpse,"June 5, 2018",5,App is great however Walmart Pay is lacking The app itself is fantastic! I can easily find the items I want to order and it helps to find the isles for the merchandise I need. The trouble is I’ve been using Apple Pay frequently and it’s quick convenient and easy. Walmart pay is almost just as slow and  as pulling out the old plastic. It’s in no way revolutionary nor a technological achievement. With quick on the go lifestyles time is important to your customers. Get with Apple incorporate savings catcher as a rewards program instead of a stand alone and increase the speed of your check out lanes.
172,EJMBAM,"June 12, 2018",2,"Walmart App ok...Walmart Grocery has a lot to improve upon Once an order is submitted, you have the option to add items to that standing order; however, you can’t be promised you’ll get those items-because Walmart Pickers make random substitutions (which you can reject at pick up & then requires more work for employees to put back 🙄). I like the option to uncheck substitutions, but why isn’t it an option to uncheck when you add onto a standing order??"
173,Proud-Mom-Of-4,"July 15, 2018",5,Best App you could ask for Love this app! If you shop at Walmart and have a smartphone you should have this app! It saves you money! But you must submit the receipt within 7 days or right after you use Walmart Pay! Walmart Pay can only be used if you have a credit card or a Walmart card through them! If you charge it and pay it right off there is nothing to worry about it just builds your credit rating up; plus you get the benefits that come with using the app! Trust me this was my first app! It has blown me away! Walmart May have its critics but they sure have it together on their tech end!
174,Nonner82,"September 24, 2018",1,"Boo to Walmart Pay becoming mandatory So I loved the Walmart app with the savings catcher. I used it all the time, even while in the store to check prices instead of looking for a price checker. Now I’m getting a message that says in just over a month the only way to take advantage of savings catcher is with Walmart pay. That’s ridiculous! Once that happens and I spend my collected savings I guess I’ll just delete the app. Most of the time I use cash for my purchases and now with this change, I’m just out of luck bc I won’t be able to scan my receipt. First Walmart does away with price matching, but I wasn’t super upset about that bc I was taking full advantage of savings catcher doing most of the work for me. The whole reason I even downloaded this app was bc of the savings catcher. I guess the upside is I’ll free up some space on my phone."
175,Paradise Painting,"October 30, 2018",1,"Walmart Pay / Savings Catcher As of yesterday, the new update to the Walmart app NOW only allows you to scan receipts that were purchased through Walmart Pay. Unbeknownst to me at this point, I made 2 shopping trips which NEITHER could be submitted to savings catcher as they were purchased normally at checkout with my bank card! That is my biggest negative remark. The others are that the app and in store NEVER match on anything, quantity, price, etc!!! Quit shoving Walmart pay down your customer’s throats!!! The success of something is a direct result of meeting the needs of all clientele not just one group of that clientele!! I will not change my needs to suit your idea of how I should shop. It should be the other way around. Between myself and my husband, we shop 2-4 times weekly at your stores. That ended yesterday with this new update."

The app logs me out several times while im in line, so im trying to be ready and not hold people up but...the app! No paper receipt is making things more complicated than they should be and if i try to print it from home it wastes ungodly amounts of paper. Worst of all employees don't know how to use it and tell me they ‘hate that thing’. I was old i could select to not use my card stored in the app, followed the instructions in settings but the setting didn't stay resulting in the app charing almost $200 to a credit card i specifically said no to. The cashier and manager told me the only way to rectify it would be to rescan each item as a return and do the whole thing over. What a mess!!!"
177,Bglantz,"March 13, 2019",1,Pharmacy is unreliable I ordered refills from the app 2 days ago. Was supposed to be ready the next day at 11. The app said all meds had refills. Called the pharmacy after the time it was supposed to be ready and was on hold for 30 minutes. Couldn’t wait had to hang up. Called back the next morning to find out they never received my refills order and one of my meds had no refills. They could not answer why this happened and gave me 1-800-Walmart to call. Well I called them and they told me it was because I didn’t have full access so I couldn’t order thru the app until the pharmacy gave me full access. But the app told me it was process. So I basically got the run around from the 3 people I talked to because it apparently isn’t anyone’s job to make sure anything gets done correctly or that people don’t die waiting on medication.

Yes, we get it you have EVERYTHING but unfortunately for Walmart, everything is overwhelming and a waste of time. Like I’m really going to search through 11,000 search results not to mention half of them are straight out of China and look sketchy as can be. Sometimes the app lets you filter for in store and sometimes it doesn’t offer it. Most the time I don’t have the option which makes me end up closing the app and going to Target or somewhere else. Ughh I’m over it waste of time and frustrating."

I then noticed today (4/1) that an item that previously said it was sold by another seller, now says sold by Walmart. I checked the 2 other items and they now say sold by Walmart too?

181,Lover Girl MelMel,"May 31, 2018",5,Outside of store needs litter cleaned up regularly The inside of the store is always clean and orderly. The outside of the grounds needs some attention. There is always litter in the side grassy areas and the parking lot usually has trash laying on the pavement. I feel like the outside should be given daily attention with clean up of not just the carts. There is a lot of people that use this store in a days time. It needs to have regular attention outside so the trash doesn’t become unruly. The grassy area at the front of the store as people pass by always looks well maintained. It is on the sides of the building and parking lot I am speaking of.
182,babykins12britt,"September 21, 2018",1,"Another “update” I like may other savings catcher users received an email stating that you will only be able to upload receipts via Walmart pay come Oct 29, 18, which is absolutely stupid. You’re completely excluding people who may not be tech savvy or the ones who’d prefer to pay in cash. I like many others barely trust Walmart to know my gift card number let alone give them my credit or debit card number. I’m sure this is just their way to slowly stop the savings catcher program, as I’m sure they’re burnt out on having to give money back to its customers.  This program has really become a joke, and any attempts at contacting for issues always go without response. I continued to shop at Walmart because of the savings catcher program, but looks like I’ll be shopping at the competitor store from now on."

I’m on happy with this change. One reason I can think that this is a bad idea is for the situations when you want to use multiple means to pay for transaction. Such as, paying a little bit of the bill in cash, a little bit of the bill on one card and a little bit of the bill on another card. I mention this because I have done this. You can’t do that when you’re paying with Walmart pay, which means if I want to do this I won’t be able to submit my receipt to savings catcher. I think the app was working great until you released the email about making these changes in October."

Seems to me y’all like to discriminate against the poor or people on disability. The only people who can use your app are people who can pay with credit or debit cards, good ole cash just isn’t good enough. Walmart is really starting to show their true colors. I worked for this place and I really thought this app was giving people a chance to see a difference in them. I was wrong!

I have had some problems off and on with it not taking receipts and not finding matched items, but this new update is too far.  To force me to use Walmart Pay in order to use savings catcher is not right.  Walmart Pay seems like some type of scam anyways and has numerous complaints.  I refuse to use it and will have to stop using savings catcher.  I don’t think Walmart realizes how many customers they will lose over this as I will now just start shopping the sale items at the other stores.  Even though I have to drive a little farther since Walmart chased out the 2 grocery stores we did have in our little town.  The other stores have better variety anyways."
194,Czilla85,"October 29, 2018",3,"Great but no more... Aside from the “in stock” issue that plagues this app, one major issue is that it oftentimes updates which aisles things are in when the store itself hasn’t updated the aisle (ex. product A being in aisle M but the store not even having an aisle M). That aside, the worst decision Walmart has made in recent years is taking the Catching Saver away from us. We now are forced to pay using Walmart Pay. Why is this an issue? Because many of our banks do not support such things and therefore our cards cannot be entered into such a system. Many of us also find it easier to simply scan our own receipts. It was a foolish decision to take this away and someone needs to correct it."

The app NEVER shows in stock items at your store. I just want to be able to browse what is available at my preferred store and it can’t figure it out. For example: let’s say I want to look at women’s clothing in stock at ‘my store’ so you filter it accordingly and it shows you about 65 socks and maybe a shirt and bras and then boys clothes and sunglasses. Now tell me, do all of the items listed above seem like women’s clothing? This has been happening for years. The only thing the app is good for is checking the price of an item when in store.

And even when in stock, the store price was $10 (25%) higher than the app reported anyway. I asked a manger for help and showed her the app's listing of the item and its shelf location and she wearily conceded, ""yeah, that thing's not usually accurate."" So what's the point then, really? We can use Maps to find locations, and Walmart management admits it's not accurate on prices or stock status, so it's just taking up space on your phone without offering a real benefit."

So now like last night when going to Walmart the app wasn’t working and I couldn’t scan the machine to save my receipt to get money back. So now again I’m loosing money cause I can’t scan my own receipt. I’m not the only one that doesn’t like this new process and should go back to how it was. If it’s not broke than don’t try to fix it.

218,Nihvugc,"January 2, 2020",1,"Worst. App. Ever! Walmart employees will encourage you to use this app while in the store to find the things you’re looking for and pay for purchases. However, it doesn’t sync to store inventory very well, so half the time, it won’t tell you item locations or even correct price. It also takes 3 times longer to pay now. So basically, it’s another paper weight app that won’t do any of the things it was designed to do. The saddest part is that it used to be a great app. But after all the changes, this crappy app is literally the only way to get the cash back savings on your card. Ugh! Just do yourself a favor and go to Target. Their app works. Their red card works. You don’t have to do a dog and pony routine to get what’s promised to you. 🤷‍♀️ Live and learn, I guess. Thanks for the life lesson, Walmart!"
219,LittleCrit,"August 1, 2019",2,"Meh I like the app well enough, but when I search for an item, it would be nice to be able to search by name. Without that option were available, I’d give a better review. Without it, it makes it hard to find items. Would be very nice if that was included in the search option. Also, being able to select a department to look at, it would be nice to be able to search within that department. "
220,4ng3lB4by,"November 28, 2017",1,Why won’t the app let me use it with out the new update? I don’t get it. If an update is optional why won’t it let me use it with the update? I like the app as is. I really don’t like updating it cuz every time I do something always changes and I really don’t want to deal with the headache of learning the app all over again. Just let me use the app and let me choose if I want to update it or not! Ugh! It isn’t hard to add a simple “update later” option on the update screen when it pops up. Is it too much to ask for me to choose when I want to update the app on my phone!? Stupid lazy programmers can’t even put in a simple “update later” option! Seriously? Are u dumb programmers? Some people want that option! Think of those people when u want to throw us a new update! Ugh!
221,petehall😖,"June 25, 2018",3,Items I store with app. The app used to tell me exactly where an item was when entered in the app a few weeks ago. Now it still works for finding items but not as well. When you put in like real lemon juice for an example. It will show you all kinds of items but the lemon juice is way down the list and it only shows the one for Iberia and not real lemon juice nor the squeeze ones. Allot of the grocery items are like this now. 3 weeks or a month ago it would tell you exactly where they were at to of list and now it only shows some of what you put in if any and not all as well as stuff not even related to what you put into the app.

I thought Walmart would invest more in a speedy app! Plus, the search results for online products is so jumbled! (Worse than in stores tbh) lol I shop a lot of websites online, and this is far the worst. The lowest price feature also isn’t correct. I like the products and shipping though. It’s amazing when you can find your stuff and all that time it takes to find it. It comes fast and never really had any issues with it past the slow app. Even on browser it’s so slow compared to all its competitors. I hope Walmart fixes it."
224,LizOf8,"September 27, 2018",2,"I miss REAL price matching Sure, the in app price checker is great because nothing is ever labeled or where it’s supposed to be. However, the savings catcher does not keep up with local prices. Add to that the fact that receipts I submitted weeks ago show there are lower prices but it still says receipt submitted instead of being processed and $ credited to the account, it’s become more of a hassle than it’s worth. Now, I’m being told it will only work with Walmart pay... there’s no way I’m linking my bank account to something that can easily be hacked. I’ve chosen Walmart over other stores because of the services offered. With these services being stripped down, I’ll just drive the same distance the opposite direction and go to Winco."
225,Romimibu,"December 8, 2018",1,"Haven’t been back I haven’t been back to Walmart since they changed the savings catcher program. It was the only reason I went there. I liked accumulating the savings for those times in between paychecks when my cash was low. Other grocery stores are farther away or are a few cents more expensive so it “seems” inconvenient to go to them, but they have no lines or nearly no lines, they are cleaner, friendlier, and keep their products stocked. So I just don’t have a reason to go to Walmart anymore. I did try ordering online because I thought that might be a nice convenience after I broke my ankle, but that was a joke. I tried it several different times. I’ll be writing for 30 minutes if I start explaining how that was a fiasco each time I did the online ordering."

Plus if my husband or one of my kids goes to the store without me then that receipt can’t be included. I think it should be set up similar to the Meijer app. You don’t have to scan your receipt or load your app, you enter the information on the keypad & you’re done. If you forget to enter your information you can enter the receipt later. Simple!"
227,Jennabret,"February 6, 2019",4,Savings catcher pita For those of u who aren’t aware and clearly the app developer isn’t due to their response to another reviewer..u can no longer scan receipts for the savings catcher u have to use Walmart pay but u don’t actually need to use that as payment...u need to scan the Walmart pay on the opening screen before u start scanning your items u can’t wait to do it at the end bc if u have no money on there it won’t work.  It’s s real hassle now and many times it doesn’t catch other local sales.  The one feature I love most abt the app is price scanning.  So I don’t have to find a working scanner in the store.

However, I have discovered more & more that I love about this app. A couple things that come to mind is the receipt catcher, which gives you money back if an item purchased is found cheaper at another store. The other one, which I use almost every time I'm in the store, is the ability to scan items in the store to check their price. If you haven't already, I would check it out."

I came here to write that in my review and went back to the app and miraculously my reward dollars were restored. Also sometimes when trying to scan a receipt the screen shows a black blank screen and won’t scan. It can take several refreshes to get it to work on an already slow-loading app. And a few times I have given up in frustration. Guess they like to advertise and temp us with savings but like to make it as difficult as possible to get said savings"
232,idontwanttobethecashier,"June 9, 2018",1,"Self check out I hate it that my local Walmart has only one check out line with a cashier. I also hate it that most of the time when I am there the line with the cashier is not open. Twice when I have asked for them to open it they have said no and the other time they opened it but it was an obvious inconvenience to the cashier. Employees have offered to help me at the self-check lines but it is crowded, slow, stressful and twice I was overcharged because the employee scanned my items multiple times. I do not mind to use a self-check out line when I have only a few items but when I have a basket full of groceries after a long day at work I appreciate the help of a cashier. I miss the customer service and have decided to grocery shop with Harps."

I am able to use my credits to buy things outside of my budget. I desperately needed a new iPad and kept balking at the cost. Then Walmart had a great sale on iPads. I was able to get exactly what I wanted in the finish I wanted with 128gb. It cost me less than $100 because I used my Savings Catcher credits. With the ease of the app, it sure pays off to take a few minutes to scan my receipts. Thank you Walmart!"
234,Jahhjah bless,"July 23, 2018",4,Needs adjustments This is a good app but it needs a few adjustments. Two in particular are scanning and prices. Sometimes when I’m in store and I need a price check I’ll scan put sometimes on the app it’ll say this item isn’t in inventory and won’t price. And with the prices sometimes I like to plan out what I’m going to go to the store and buy but items that are only sold in stores don’t show a price. I think that even if they are only sold in stores you should still incorporate a price so people can have an idea or range of how much they might spend for that product.

So you start savings catcher to attract customers and give them more “savings”, then you follow other large stores by offering pick up/delivery. And then all of a sudden you go and change EVERYTHING so that the two don’t work together!!! This is absolute insanity!! For customers, like myself who mainly use grocery pick up, can no longer use savings catcher and have a chance to get money back for the things we purchase! It just completely blows my mind that your company is now trying to rob a large percent of your costumer base of the same exact savings that other customers get after you advertise like crazy and offer coupons for grocery pick up just to deny them the other large program you started!!!! It’s just LUDICROUS!!!!👎🏼🤬🤯😡👎🏼"

Not all the time but, a fair amount and I was satisfied with how it worked. All of the sudden, you could only submit them at the store while using the app. Well, I don’t always use the card on file so now, I’m losing a lot of money and it doesn’t matter where I shop. Why shop at Walmart and use their app if I’m not benefiting from it? It’s a waste now unless I have to buy something with my card which, I rarely do since I have other assistance. I’ll just do my own comp shopping or maybe go to Aldi which has lower prices every day anyway. Sorry Walmart, you screwed up in your greed."

Also apparently my area Walmarts (for an area covering at least 2 counties) doesn’t participate in Savings Catcher which was the whole reason I downloaded the app. I called customer service at 1-800-Walmart to find this out. They were very friendly. My suggestion is if you live somewhere rural, call that number first to see if the Walmarts you frequent participate in Savings Catcher or not before downloading and putting in all your info. "

Since Walmart can’t possibly have all the best prices on everything every week, I have found this to be a big help.  I knew I could go to Walmart and get the benefit of the lower price of certain items at other stores...Therefore I was much more likely to do all my shopping at Walmart.  Now I have to go back to the ads to see who has the best price that week and shop accordingly.  So your store will be getting a much lower percentage of my total shopping.  I don’t go to the other store just to get the best price on a few items, I do all of my shopping needs for that day or week at the other store.  "

The app frequently goes down where you can access the main screens but it errors out getting to any of your order history, Walmart pay, etc. Also, when the app “connects” with the crappy WiFi in Walmart stores it basically freezes and I have to turn off WiFi and use my data for the app to run.

I got a message saying “scanned receipts are no longer accepted” You are forced to use “Walmart Pay” to use savings catcher. 1.

No savings catcher match for those. And you can’t take ads in to prove them wrong. So the only conclusion I have is that we will have to go to where the actual sales are, and since I am already there, and Walmart has no sales, I will just buy less and less at Walmart.

After checking out you’d scan your receipt & in a few days you’d see all your savings on Either the Bluebird Card or the Walmart Card. No more holding up the lines etc . They couldn’t just keep things simple & Now the only way you get any savings is if you use the Walmart pay! I wish they would have just left it the way it was Now I’m back to shopping at 3 Grocery Stores

270,Czechmomof2,"October 16, 2017",5,"Bring on the money! Love this app, already have 15$ back from my first receipt! The savings catcher is awesome-really easy to use. I haven't tried the grocery pick-up yet but I'm going to do that next. It automatically loads the items I purchased previously so I'm hoping it wont be too difficult or take too much time. So glad I won't have to do the shopping any more. That's a few hours (if not more) I can spend doing something else. Glad Walmart put this app together!!! What a time and money saver!!"
271,MiamiITengineer,"May 25, 2018",4,"AMAZING!! I love everything on here but I wish they made the shopping lists easier to access the items online listing because you’re only allowed to see the description on the list or mark it as bought/deleted, you can’t actually visit the item’s link. Another thing, Walmart’s app devs absolutely ruined the app by removing color coded buttons!!! I wish they’d bring back the color coded buttons because now it’s not a modern app, it’s a minimalist app which is not the same. Minimalist apps are for lifestyle softwares but should never be applied to such a varied shopping app 🤦🏼‍♂️"

Love the easy faster return feature, only used it once but great time saver. Really great app. It’s made Walmart one of my favorite stores again!

Reordering regular items online is a breeze! Really love this app!!"

They will only allow submission of new receipts through wal mart pay, which would be ok if they’d give you a printed receipt at check out, but they don’t unless you call a manager over - which holds up the line and is a big hassle. I use my receipt for numerous $ savings app, and I need an actual receipt to do so. If I try to print a receipt from my wal mart account, it prints in such tiny print that it STILL cannot be used. They are going out of their way to make it difficult for folks to use the savings catcher feature - another money savings effort for Wal-Mart to increase their profit margin..."
275,MeNotYou2442,"November 21, 2018",1,"Is the item in stock or not? I’m only interested in 3 things- price, is the item in stock?, and if so at what location. This app tells you an item is in stock, then you click on the item (in my case I was looking for motor oil) and it says “not available for pick up” WHAT!?! You just told me it’s in stock at a certain location! This is basic math. You get a shipment of goods and ITEM COUNT of stuff available to buy in the store. As people buy things they get subtracted from the ITEM COUNT. Sales are tracked in a database and should be instantaneously reflected on this app. Instead, this app tells you something is in stock and out of stock at the same time! IDEA- Start using domestic IT services instead of outsourcing them to overpopulated third world countries!!!"
276,marcovk,"March 24, 2019",1,"No advantage to using Walmart pay I thought using Walmart pay would help expedite returns. But it doesn’t. You go through a bit of a process to find your item among all your digital receipts (you don’t get a written receipt when you use Walmart pay).  And then when I got to the store, although there was a registered designated as “express” for the mobile app users, I still had to stand in line with everybody else. There is no advantage to using Walmart pay within this app. It is just as quick and easy to take out my credit card and use that. And when I want to return something, it’s much easier to find it on the written receipt then to scroll through digital receipts, only to stand in line with everybody else"

It took me over an hour to put in my food order today, partially because of the crashes, but also partially because I was continually being told that Walmart was out of an item and it would be removed from my cart (then it would crash). When I went back into the app to start the process all over again, the food item that was “not in stock” was actually in stock. It did this for 6 of my items in this same cycle: out of stock message, crash, open up app again, add item back, checkout again, another item is out of stock, crash, repeat."

However, I work in a group home for adults with developmental disabilities and having it in supply is an absolute must. I had a 40 OZ bottle already in stock. Managed to order some on the Walmart app and was told it would be 2 WEEKS before it arrived. After waiting the entire 2 week period I receive a message saying “sorry, your item is on back order and has been cancelled”. Now, my supply is almost completely gone and I just found out I have none on the way at all. It’s awesome that health care workers can’t get the supplies we need even when we order weeks in advance."

Over the course of 2 years, I accumulated a little over a hundred dollars in savings. The problem is that I’ve since upgraded to a different phone.

I was never a big fan of Walmart because I absolutely love the deals I get with in store coupons which Walmart never does but after all these added features, I’ve became a huge fan. I have $36 in my savings catcher account that took no time at all to accumulate."
282,Lindzdee,"October 24, 2018",1,Hate the upcoming update I’ve used this app for years and saved a lot of money by scanning my paper receipts. Now with this new update I won’t be able to do that anymore no can only scan my receipts if I pay using the Walmart pay option. Which won’t let you use a debit card but only credit. They should still let everyone scan their paper receipts even if I don’t use Walmart pay. It’s ridiculous! I loved the app up until this point. Now it’s frustrating that the feature I used constantly can’t be used anymore unless I buy my products with a credit card. They need to put a debit card option on Walmart pay as well if that’s the case. So I can have the choice to pay with whatever card I’d like.
283,aWonderwoman,"November 5, 2018",2,"The Savings Catcher part of the app is very inconvenient with its new “improvements “ Before the end of October 2018, you could scan in your receipt on your phone using the app and it would check competitors prices and give you the difference if a lower price was found. Now while they still do that, the only way to get a receipt in the system is to use Walmart Pay and have a debit or credit card linked to the app. So if you pay in cash or with a card that is not in the app you are out of luck.

That was all short lived when the app stopped allowing you to scan your receipts in and now you HAVE to use Walmart pay in order to be able to receive savings if any. Big inconvenience for me because sometimes i pay with cash, which forces me to use my debit card. Where did my option go? And will it ever come back. Now my cash purchases are useless and i could be missing out on savings."

I have lost so much money because of this update where receipts can’t be scanned anymore!!!! Every time I ask an employee what I need to do in order to do the savings catcher....NOBODY KNOWS!!! I am furious over this fact! I would save all my money  to do my kids back to school shopping every year!! I am honestly ready to stop shopping at Walmart again because of it. That was the only reason why I went back there in the first place!!! I feel this was done because Walmart wanted to make it difficult! Not only that it seems to me that Walmart would educate their employees as well but NOPE!! I’m so over it!! 👎

No checkin.  Not very easy or convenient. The app also doesn’t have the ability to login using iphone face ID forcing you to type email and password.

I use this app multiple times a week while shopping in Walmart either to find products or check the price on products. Since the latest update the app has been practically unusable in the store. It always vibrated once when opened in-store to welcome me to that location. Now, while the app is open in-store it vibrates every 3 - 5 seconds and in so doing it causes the screen to stall or change. So if I'm trying to scan an item to check price it becomes nearly impossible. I previously loved the app but this latest update is terrible. Please fix these issues."

When filling out required fields for things like shipping, it does not want to auto fill any of the information which is not typical. The app works about as good as Walmart customer service in general😀. Purchasing items through the app you’ll learn things like having a very difficult time returning the item if it is from a third-party seller and Price catcher now requires you to use Walmart pay which no one wants to do."

I have even ordered an item for same day store pickup while I was in the store, and the app said that they had the product.  I would then receive an email saying that they were getting my item ready as we speak.  The next email (2 hrs later) would then say that there was a problem and it would be ready in 3 days!

293,LaneyLooLove,"May 8, 2018",1,Mobile pharmacy issues The app works great when you are not inside the store. In theory you should be able to order multiple prescriptions and easily pick them up. In practice when you are in the store you don’t have enough signal to use the app either on your cellular data or the store WiFi. So you have to go inside and outside every time you want to pick up a prescription or plan ahead and only get one at a time. Then if there is an error you have to wait in the main line. My advice forget skipping the line because it doesn’t work and just proceed to the main line to save time. Maybe the stores can improve their WiFi to allow it to be used since cell reception is bad in the store.
294,Macboy4 life,"June 6, 2018",1,Scam Ever time I enter a receipt it never gives back when lower price is out there. I’ve know on several occasions that I bought stuff at Walmart and then found out another store close was cheaper😡. Also when there’s money on the card when I go to use it it says that there’s no balance come to find out the money was removed off my saving catcher card and saying I used it when I haven’t. I’ve got screwed out of $25 from this scam!!! I’ve called and Walmart saving catcher customer services said oh I’ll put money back on card I’m sorry for this it won’t happen again well money never gets put back on card and it keeps happening.

I know I may be over paranoid but I don’t link my credit card to anything if I don’t have to but with the new changes it’s basically forcing me to do that if I still want the savings catcher or I have to get a gift card and load the account that way. I don’t want to use Walmart pay every time I buy something at Walmart just to get the a few dollars savings. I’m so disappointed and unless it changes back I’ll have to just delete this app."

You can do a much better job with the App. On my iPhone App I would like to see more options of items I am looking for. For example if I’m looking for comforters a grid would be nice. If I have the option of thousands of different designs of course I’m not sitting there for days looking. Sometimes the filters freeze. Sometimes the App freezes. I had to delete the App before and today and download that’s how I took time to add to my original review.

The shopping the records that he keeps though I can re-order and show me any sales on what I like and I do enjoy other options I’m still exploring what else it has to offer
302,Blessings & Favor,"June 3, 2018",5,The Savings Catcher is Amazing It is nothing more better than to go shopping at Walmart knowing you are going to win every time. If you are all about a bargain then save your time and shop at Walmart; scan your receipt with the saving catcher app or type in online and they will search to see if any other stores had that item on sale without you going store to store. And guess what if the item happens to be on sale you get the difference. Wow isn’t that Wonderful🙂👏🏽
303,ARLACRYOR,"June 3, 2018",3,Savings catcher / price scan The price scan feature is hard to access often ! And if an item is seasonal or on sale forget it !! And when I know prices are cheaper at another store and I scan my savings catcher receipt in it seams that Walmart will adjust the in store price so that it is lower than the sale price or regular price at other stores after I purchase at a higher price at Walmart. Which reflects a cheaper price for Walmart so I am out of luck as far as getting the savings catcher money back difference !! Kinda tricky !! If you want my opinion !! But would you expect anything more from Walmart ??

A nice perk of using savings catcher is having all my receipts organized in one spot- in the app. Go to purchase history, click on the plus sign on the top right, scan your receipt and it will ask you if you want to submit to savings catcher simultaneously. Click yes an it’s literally effortless savings."

It was meant to increase the use of Walmart Pay and prevent the use of other people's receipts. What it ACTUALLY does, however, is 1. Prevents customers from using other money back/savings apps, and 2. Prevents a large group of people that aren't as proficient with technology from using this service. And what if I need to use a different card for whatever reason? Plus, Walmart Pay screws up at checkout constantly. Not every time, but very regularly. I've missed out more often than not trying to use Walmart Pay. This was an absolute crap decision. At least allow the option to scan via camera. Boo. Seriously."

I’ve submitted feedback 3 times about this problem, and no response, of course. We used to be able to scan receipts to submit to Savings Catcher, but that stopped so we have to use Walmart Pay.

This latest version just skips to step 3 payment method and choses pickup for you. I finally accidentally “figured out” how to checkout with shipping but am not sure I can do it next time. This was always a terrible app compared to every other shopping app out there, but now it is willfully deceitful and infuriating.  Get your money while you can a$$holes because your willful incompetence will ensure you will not be a viable company by the end of this century!  There’s a reason Bezos lapped your stagnant company like it was grandmas fruitstand."

I couldn’t even access history to see what was happening with the order. At 4 hour of point I went into the store and bought the items.

Not everyone has a debit card and the ones you get from the stores that are reloadable are a joke! I think it needs to go back to the way it used to be. I used the savings catcher just about every time I shopped at Walmart which is usually several times a week. I have used my savings on multiple purchases, not just for myself but my family (which includes children) and also household items. With the way it is set up now, I will no longer be able to use the savings catcher 😞. I’m very disappointed in this new update. Not a lot of thinking went into this."

The only reason Walmart uses Walmart Pay is because they don't want to accept other mobile payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay.  Competition.  Doesn't make a lot of sense because the money is still being spent in the store regardless.  The Savings Catcher part of the app is a joke.  No matter how much money you spend they never seem to be able to find a lower price at any of the other stores nearby, so  they don't have to bother giving you the difference on a gift card.  Hmmm, how convenient.  Think before you download this app and just shop at Target instead.    ..... they now accept Apple Pay."

To my surprise, every product, food or detergent/cleaner came up in the “found” search window. Approximately 236 items were a match, but no lemon curd food. The in-store map is useless.

This is a terrible inconvenience and there should be an option to still save and receive cash back. Not to mention more times than I can count it won’t even give you a paper receipt without asking for assistance. Savings catcher WAS a great way for families to save but with the way things are going with only one or two isle open that aren’t scan and go and needing to use Walmart pay to save I’d honestly rather go to Aldi and then to Publix for anything else. Where the employees are welcoming and friendly.

I’m not getting anything back on things I know are on sale for less elsewhere. I was shopping everywhere else to save money but the savings catcher from Walmart was a great incentive to shop there. It was working wonderfully until they updated it at the end of January 2018. Now it won’t scan receipts from some Walmart stores and it won’t show what was on the receipt. Now it says I have to submit receipts after I’ve scanned them. It used to be much easier to use this app for the savings catcher but now is horrible. It’s not worth my time anymore. I’m going back to shopping at other stores to get the savings.

You have to search for that item (again), find the exact one you had in your list, re-compare pricing, and then add it to your cart. It’s very time consuming and not at all convenient.

Example Dr. Pepper in the store costs $4.43 for a 12 pack but the app says it’s $7.56 for a 12 pack. What's the correct price? Savings catcher works sometimes and then sometimes not. It reports savings found but doesn’t say what items you saved on or you scan in a receipt and 1 to 1.5 weeks go by and it doesn’t show that it’s doing anything. The app does a good job helping locate products in the store and when products don’t look like they are the right price the barcode scanner is very handy.

376,Birdgirl52,"March 16, 2019",3,"Sad news!! I have to lower my rating. I'm sure it's due to greed that they are discontinuing the savings catcher. That was a big draw for me to shop at Wal-Mart. Now I will be more inclined to go to other grocery stores in addition to get the lower price. I do like the app, the fact that I can check a price or locate where they stock what I'm shopping for but this is a huge disappointment for me because the money that accumulates on my savings catcher was always my grocery money on vacation. They are a multi-billion dollar business already but it's never enough for them, is it?"
377,Karolee1,"May 13, 2019",1,"Walmart Pay - PLEASE GET APPLE PAY!! It had a rough start. Most employees had NO idea what to do or how to use it. Then, it started working a little more than it was failing. But lately... it fails more than it works! Either it stalls while you are at the register, tells you to “wait for the cashier” even when you are at self check out, or it just doesn’t load. Last time I used it it stalled, I canceled it, pulled out and used my card, and then it took BOTH the electronic payment AND the card payment. (Thankfully they canceled one of the payments.)"
378,Shopping queen to 211,"February 6, 2020",1,"Item Availability Unreliable I wanted to use this app to check if what I’m shopping for is in stock. Sometimes it will say availability unknown and that’s understandable. What frustrates me is when the app says in stock aisle N6 and I go to the store and it’s not there and the people working that department say they haven’t seen it in a while. And yes, I make sure I’m at the correct store. If this happened occasionally I wouldn’t say anything but it seems to happen more often then not. It’s to the point were it feels pointless to even check. I wish they would only put in stock if they had it in stock. If they can’t  accurately track the availability of an item then should just put unknown."
379,Terry Pereda,"January 27, 2020",1,"App is HORRIBLE!!!! There is no support when things go wrong with this APP. I had a credit card on file with WalmartPay and it expired so I deleted that one and have tried for weeks to add my new credit card with no luck. You have the choice of scanning te new credit card or entering the info. Have tried to do both and I get the message, oops something went wrong. No kidding!!!!  I even asked for help at my local Walmart and several people tried to add it as well and they got the same message. "
380,DeAngela93,"December 26, 2017",5,"Great App but..... I think the Walmart App is a great app it has improved so much since I first installed it. It’s so resourceful when you can’t find a price scanner, or when you need to see if something is in stock in the stores near you, but it would be great if there was a feature where you can pay on your layaways once you’ve set it up in the store...now that would be convenient and less stressful especially during the holiday times."
381,Sharphusband,"May 27, 2018",5,"Why you need this App! Savings catcher, buy stuff and scan the receipt, 3 days later, the price you pay is more than another store, walmart gives the difference back. Only stupid people dont use this...buy scan earn...so easy and i have almost $60 saved n over $115 since i started...dont judge...it filled my car up when i was short and some munchies!!! Please partake of this n the rest of the App is so easy to use n navigate...we love it!"
382,bayouboy95,"May 31, 2018",3,Carolyn’s Day Out I love to go to Walmart but sometimes it’s very aggravating when they are out of the product I need and there is not enough checkers working and the Price label on the shelf is incorrect so when I go to check out I cannot always keep up to check every price that is scanned so when I get all the way home which is at least 20 minute drive and check my receipt to find I was overcharged or the check out person scanned One or more items twice. Other than these problems I truly love going to Walmart – it is the highlight of my life!!!
383,Female Executive,"June 8, 2018",2,"Extreme Frustration I liked this app; as well as the updated improvements except for one thing. There seems to be absolutely no way to access your wishlists now when you open the app. If you put an item on a wishlist it will open, but let’s say you want to open the app and get back to your lists to buy something from them... you seem to be S-O-L. That makes the wishlists you have painstakingly curated for each room; personal purpose, COMPLETELY MOOT. This begets extreme frustration for me — and so I end up closing the Walmart app and opening the wayfair or overstock or the target apps to purchase from my wishlists and ideabooks over there."
384,Tyree1964,"June 9, 2018",5,"Best money saver EVER! Literally shop at Walmart, submit your receipt and watch your money add up for future purchases! No more digging through flyers, going from this store to that trying to save s buck or two (think of the gas)no more waiting in line and giving up because you’d rather just get what you want and get HOME! Over the Holidays I had a sizable chunk to spend on gifts! THANK you Walmart I’m forever a loyal shopper, even if people do like to make fun of the “People at Walmart”"
385,ceelyme,"June 24, 2018",3,"Pharmacy section needs work The app is great for looking up things in the store, shopping and savings catcher. The problem is the pharmacy part. It is very difficult to manage more than one family member. I set mine up and it has all of my daughter’s meds under my name. When I try to add her or add myself it won’t recognize us as valid. If I order a refill on the app, it shows as received but the pharmacy doesn’t get it. Very frustrating. Walgreen’s Pharmacy app is much better. Has a drop down menu for different family members and is very easy to request refills."
386,mommy06/19/16,"October 6, 2018",1,Never will use this app ever again They stoled money several occasions out of my bank account. They have no updates on the filters. It’s not Walmart there self but it’s the market places they are link  up with where they sell the market place orders to the customers but they have also Walmart has a couple times. Stole money out of my account not returned it as they said they will do not trust this app I been using it since 2011 I have nothing but problems with it. It is better if you just go to the store and buy your items with cash rather then debit cards I have had my debit cards past five of them with different banks compromise meaning debit Info was stolen.
387,Lenb290,"November 28, 2018",1,This app has stopped working and no support I used this app and the Walmart pay feature for 1.5 years and loved it. As a law enforcement officer I loved no sliding my card in a public setting. Something changed 6 months ago. All of a sudden when I use wal mart pay I get transaction denied. I pull out the exact same card I have stored in Walmart pay and run it though the refrained and it’s approved. I called Walmart customer service SEVEN times since June of 2018 with this issue and I am told they have to email this to a special department and they will get back to me via email....I have still never heard from wal mart customer service to this day. 
388,Tefinie,"December 4, 2018",1,Do not like the new version of this app. -0 My account was hacked all my Saving Catcher money was used at a Walmart. And nothing is has or will be done. I scanned receipts all year and saved this for my Christmas extras. 
389,Nic511986,"August 6, 2019",1,Don’t count on Walmart pay to work every time I use Walmart pay many times but recently I used the app where I purchased a lot of groceries (only had my phone that day). I don’t carry my card every time. The app did not work and the manager helping (or lack of) was horrible. Worthless. She said it’s the app and it’s not their problem. I had to walk out of the store after spending an hour shopping. I will not be going back to that Walmart. After that the app worked and then failed to work another time at a different time. I didn’t even bother complaining. I’m paranoid so I have to carry my card every single time. What’s the point?! I avoid Walmart as much as I can now.
390,My3Monkiez,"September 25, 2017",5,Saving Catcher Since learning about how I could actually make money by buying what I actually need I must say that Walmart is now my must go to store for almost everything my family needs. I was just able to buy a gift that is extremely popular this year for my children with money saved by my savings catcher and not have to actually have to use any of our money out of pocket which is always great!!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS APP TO EVERYONE!!!
391,bigiphoneinreno,"February 6, 2018",5,There are none better!! This is the very best put together app. From the point you walk in the App is everything you need while shopping. It’s makes shopping at WalMart an enjoyment. From finding items to the awesome checklist and then when your done keep your card safe and use Walmart Pay. This is just a few of the awesome things this app can do. If you don’t have it on your phone you’re completely missing out.
392,jebxbdjs,"May 25, 2018",5,"Convenient This app is very convenient and easy to use. I use it mainly for the ad match(savings catcher) feature and I get money back all the time. Since November 2017, I have accumulated $130 back from Walmart by scanning in my receipts. Groceries is what I mainly get my money back for. And I shop here quite frequently, so that has a lot to do with it as well. FYI, I get most of my money back on 12 pack sodas. There is always 12 pack sodas on sale somewhere else cheaper, apparently."
393,Deidredahn1,"May 28, 2018",1,"Works well except at the most important times I would rate 5 stars, except that many times when I try to add a gift card to my account using my phone, I get a message saying there’s a problem with the gift card. If I go to my computer and try to add the card, it works just fine. Additionally, about 20% of the time, if I try to use Walmart Pay inside the store, I get a message saying, “Oops! There’s a problem on our side. Please try again later.” Very frustrating if I have money in my Walmart account for the very purpose of using at Walmart, then have to use my debit card. There’s never anything anyone at the stores can do about it - just out of luck at that point."
394,Eaglescoutmom,"June 24, 2018",5,Walmart savings app This is fairly new to me and haven't used much yet but I will say I know I'm going to be using this; I used this for the first time as my father has COPD by the time I get off work I don’t feel like walking through the store and it’s a time saver order online & pick it up the people that help you out to your car with your groceries are the nicest people.  I commend Karen & Joe for all their hard work with this great new time & money saver service!!!!!
395,shopmiester,"June 29, 2018",2,"Common sense would be nice! Products should be placed where you would think to look for it. For example, lint rollers seem like they would be near laundry products or at the very least near pet supplies. Instead, they are way across the store by hangers. Also, it is ridiculous to see lines of people waiting to check out, when there are several registers not being utilized. Sure, I can use self check but I shouldn’t have to. I believe that the cost of the cashiers are included in the price of your products. Then if you do self check, you should get a discount, since I am doing the work of the cashier."
396,Mom24monsters,"July 31, 2018",3,"Thank you for finally fixing the pharmacy for Voiceover users The one thing that I use the app for most was the pharmacy, and until the last update, they rendered this useless for those of us who use voiceover. I would have left a review for the last update, but I thought it was a fluke, but since it remained in this update, decided that I would write a review. Thank you for fixing it! This was a major thing for those of us who needed to do important things like fill prescriptions. Shopping is great, but if we’re not alive to do it, it doesn’t do anybody any good."

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone to use Walmart pay while checking out and it doesn’t open. It’s not like I have a crappy old phone or anything, I use the newest model iPhone so it’s the app. It’s very frustrating that you never know if it’s going to work or not. It just doesn’t work today, you can tap Walmart pay 100 times and it isn’t doing a thing. Crap app just like the crap customer service you always get at Walmart. Too bad it’s the only store of its kind in my area 🤬"
398,Judy12728282&282,"August 18, 2019",1,Bring back saving catcher If you don’t bring back saving catcher you are going to loose a lot of business. You made it easy for stay at home moms to not have to coupon. I started a Facebook couponing group and now it has 900k members and we help each other with coupons and were to go now that y’all stopped savings catcher. I am from Arkansas and strongly believe in buying from local companies Even if they are huge corporations like Walmart. However I refuse to pay when your number one selling propaganda is that you always have the best prices and always rollback. You lost at least 900k shoppers from one Facebook group over the savings catcher. Stop being greedy.
399,Peaches999,"June 18, 2019",3,Prescription refill I have loved this app however last month the prescription refill quit working. When I submit my order it tells me there was an error with submitting the order and to try again. No matter how many times I try it keeps doing it. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and it is still doing it. I have ended up going into the store to order the refill. I don’t know if there was an update that broke it or what but it was working for me and suddenly it’s not. It’s a bit annoying. My IPhone is up to date.
400,Kikigilb,"November 16, 2017",1,"You have got to be kidding me So you want to push people back into your stores by charging less if you pickup and more if you want to buy online and ship? Your stores, at least my store, are already dreadfully busy with long lines. Now you want me to pickup to get the product cheaper? I am not talking small differences in the price... I’m talking let’s say-mustard... .48 pickup or 1.50 to have it shipped.  If you wanted to test this... wait until after Christmas! In the age of technology I just can not believe you are driving people to your stores like this. You should just start charging for people to use credit cards, NOT! It’s called the cost of doing business. Ugh"
401,VaBreeze,"June 13, 2018",2,"Too many out of stocks and discontinued items We LOVE our WM Neighborhood Market, but the out of stocks are insane. We also see many good selling items being discontinued. I’m familiar with WM’s computer assisted ordering and it’s my opinion that items are often discontinued due to slow movement, but that slow movement is often due to either consistent out of stocks or supply chain issues from suppliers. Either way, WM is losing a lot of revenue because customers like us frequently have to shop other retailers to get what we want to buy. "
402,Bevie8k,"July 13, 2018",1,"Customer service I would have to say that for all the years of going to shopping centers and working the customer service , Walmart has to be the poorest customer service of all. They do not strive to make customers happy and they do not share the joyful attitudes that customer service reps need to share for they are the faces and personality that will bring me and others back in the store. I find now with myself and moms in groups would rather shop online now just so they can skip the nasty treatment they receive at walmart. Walmart in Riverdale,NJ in my opinion needs to start having customer service training or they will eventually find themselves without employment."
403,Melissa Sheehy,"July 22, 2018",5,Love Savings Catcher but.... It would be so helpful to have the ability to scan a receipt after 7 days . I understand that it would not be eligible for savings catcher - however it would be very useful to be able to have the receipt in digital format on my phone - that way I would never lose it. Another possibility would be to add another folder that basically just keeps all our Walmart receipts. Thank you
404,Willsgirl83,"October 30, 2018",1,"Not good anymore I used to absolutely love this app with the savings catcher and all. But now the only way to submit receipts is by using the app to pay for your stuff at the store to begin with and that seems to be for returns, which I don’t usually need. Really hard to use Wal-Mart pay to pay for your purchases when you don’t have anything on there to begin with anyway. The savings catcher was my main reason for having the Walmart app and now that we can’t get rewards anymore I think I’ll go ahead and delete it cause I don’t have a reason to keep it on the phone now. Bring back the rewards and I’ll redownload it but until then there’s no room for it."
405,Kg pat,"November 25, 2018",1,"Not good My savings catcher worked good since they came out with it. I started using Wal-Mart pay when them came out with it. Now for last 5 weeks in the spot where my total credit is is a button that says “retry”. I have hit it a couple hundred times in last 5 weeks. I have called the savings catcher phone number once a week for 5 weeks. I  told every time they are send my case to proper people to fix it and it should be fixed in 5 days or so. Of course I have to sit on hold for about 20 minutes each time. It has not been fixed in 5 weeks. Typical Wal mart. I don’t recommend anybody using it, since Wal mart can’t or won’t fix a simple problem."
406,Clgadd,"March 16, 2019",1,"Doing away with savings catcher! I knew when Walmart said they were no longer allowing comp-ads that it would just be a matter of time before they did away with savings catcher. Sure enough, they changed to not allowing manual receipt uploads. Then they changed to auto sending savings to Walmart cards, so that you could no longer save up and make meaningful purchases with saved cash, (ex. $20 birthday gift). Now they’re doing away with savings catcher all together. They gradually made it harder and harder to use any method of saving money until they did away with it altogether. It doesn’t surprise me but it still makes me mad. Highly disappointed with Walmart."

Also when using grocery list, if you scan an item in store, that comes up as out of stock, even though they have it, it won’t add the total price to the shopping total.

Walmart is definitely going high tech, but it’s starting to weird me out. The Walmart greeters have been replaced by gates that open and shut behind you.  At the checkout they have cameras and big screens everywhere that use facial detection (it puts a yellow square around your face) as it tracks your every movement.  What are they doing with that data?  It’s a little scary where things will go in another 10 years. I guess privacy is gone and human interaction with it :-(."

Not sure if this is a new thing or not, but imo it is a ridiculous thing, especially when some of the things are almost 20% more expensive online than the same thing in-store, not counting shipping, and no way to know unless you check each thing individually.  Also, I bought canned oysters online after reading all of the data labels made available online, but when I got it home they had mysteriously left out the warning label that says the product contains lead and cadmium.  Plus, they refused to include my warning of those ingredients when I reviewed the product online.  VERY dishonest, and very low-class."

411,Buggy0974,"May 26, 2018",5,"Wal Mart App This app has been the best thing since slice bread. It’s easy to use, you can easily see if the products are available in your stores near you or if it’s best to order it. The products have an isle number on them so your not roaming the store looking for it. You can also scan the products. It’s so many things I can speak on. I would suggest to anyone that has a smartphone to download it and try it for themselves. I love it....."

When you are standing in line trying to check out, it’s embarrassing when the ap will not load and then requires you to use the login prompt when it is already open with your name displayed on the opening page. This is frustrating and has happened on multiple occasions, during which I have to explain to the cashier why I have to hold up the line to grab a card."

That all well and good but why wasn’t I notified before the following day after pickup was scheduled.

When you start the app in the store, it comes up with a pop-up that prevents you from accessing Walmart Pay until it goes away.  Then, the app keeps changing your payment options!  I got the Capital One Walmart Card to use on the app and it worked fine at first.  Then, the app switched my payment back to my bank account...  and it doesn’t even tell you!!!!  I made several purchases thinking it was charging to one account and it was charging to another!!  Horrible experience!!!!"

I know they have other companies that sell through the app but it’s too much of an overload to find what I want. The filters are not helpful and sometimes when I “apply” the filter it doesn’t actually work. Also, the filters are pretty general to most items and I feel like it needs to be more specific categories.  For example when I was looking for a specific color of shirt the filters did not have sleeve length and there are thousands of items to scroll through. I wish it were more user friendly like Targets app."

I re-entered all my info and it still told me it was declined so I checked my bank account. Turned out the app charged my card for every time I tried to checkout. Luckily the bank was able to fix the charges. I might try this app in the future after many updates are made but until then I will not be using this app.

I shop at Walmart specifically because I like the savings catcher to ensure I get the lowest price. At this point I am considering taking my business elsewhere which is a shame because the next closest big box store is a 40 minute drive for my family. Fix the current services you offer instead of constantly coming out with new services which do not always work either.
424,beebryan2134,"August 18, 2018",2,"I do not like this app Walmart has made it very inconvenient to shop with the app. Features I enjoyed are filtering results by store pick up available, what’s available in store, ease of shopping by department, ability to easily distinguish from what’s sold by Walmart and what’s sold by a third party.  Unfortunately, these are no longer available and when they are it’s an act of Congress to find them. If I wanted to buy from random companies I would do a google search and find them elsewhere. Highly considering deleting this app at this point as it has made me very frustrated on several occasions."

I had no idea that there was a new update and you could only use it in store when you pay through your phone. So I just went grocery shopping, spent almost $200 and went to scan my receipt a few hours later and it won’t let me. So I just lost out on savings because they took that option away. I’m really disappointed in this. I don’t understand why they couldn’t have just had both options. Will no longer be using this app because I prefer to use cash for groceries."

For example, if I only want the retailer to be Walmart & I click on that, and I want the item to be blue & I click that, it just reverts to all retailers & all colors & erases any other specifics I click on. I tried deleting the app several times & re-installing it. Still the same hot mess. It is now virtually useless to me. This & many other reasons are why I’m now using your major competitor. I still shop in my local store, but even that is become less frequent. If you don’t do something soon, don’t think you’re too big to go the way of other large chain stores."

The app is only messing up on my IPad mini 4. It works fine on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. Good thing I have my phone for back up because if I didn’t I’d be s.o.l.

Afterwards she then proceeds to tell me that “The cake isn’t made and that the initial design I wanted was not available. I can have the other design done and ready to pickup at 11:30” Why couldn’t this been told to me the day I ordered the cake?

Since you can’t chose to just use your debit/credit card to pay, you end up using the little bit of money that you saved last trip. You don’t have an option to build up your savings. If they have a “use gift card only” option...then they need a “debit/credit card only” option to so you have the option to save if you want."

I believe this was set up because Walmart was losing money on savings catcher because they do NOT have the cheapest  prices like they claim and less people will use this way.

Our Walmart’s just always have way to much attitude and this digital age with hacking is not trustworthy for me to be linking my card. Plus, I rarely get anything back anymore.

You have in store, shop on line and now pick up and delivery. The best is Savings Catcher. It is when you present your bill and they look up the prices in your area and they give you the difference if their price is higher. I call it my in house coupon saver. Don’t forget to sign up."

494,IrishOak,"September 14, 2018",2,"Not up to par Sorry Walmart!  You really should do a better job at this app development. It used to be better. However, now I can’t use it to build a decent grocery shopping list to use before shopping. Most of the time, no items are listed or only one or two and several if not many unrelated items. The fact that the store I shop at doesn’t do a good job stocking, I’m lucky if I don’t have to go down the street to Kroger or HEB. Why don’t you fix it and populate it properly. Or is this a personnel problem of hiring people to manage who really don’t know how."

Otherwise I like the app it helps me find most of the things I need in the store. I haven’t used it to order groceries yet, but that’s on my to do list."
497,yeager78,"November 13, 2018",1,"Bad Review I used to use this app all the time. The way they have the app set up now to use savings Catcher you have to have all of your card info for each card you use on file. I don’t recommend putting your information on there. The last time I did I was hacked and I had to call customer service to take my card off file and start a whole new savings Catcher account. You can’t submit cash receipts either, that’s a big issue for me being I pay with cash a lot. I hope they change it back or I won’t be using it anymore. I hope they can tell that I deleted their app. No need for it any longer."

I wasn’t sure how it happened until I came to the Walmart app to upload a receipt and saw that there were 2 receipts for the stolen purchases and my savings catcher rewards were used with those purchases. Apparently they used my Walmart pay to steal my credit card and savings catcher rewards. I’ve since deleted my credit card information (had to anyways due to canceling the one on file). I refuse to put my new credit card on the Walmart app since clearly the security isn’t what it’s supposed to be.
499,Toots_3,"February 16, 2019",4,"Convenient I love the app. It makes things easy when I shop, especially when I forget my debit card because it is set up in Walmart pay.

I don’t always use the card I have set up or I use cash. "

However here lately, I never get anything back when I scan receipts.  Suddenly Walmart isn’t finding comparable sales which I find odd.  Plus it states my items weren’t eligible for savings catchers.   Seems like customers were making too much money back so Walmart started adding more and more restrictions so that we don’t see rewards flowing in.  Not to mention the app is incredible slow!  All in all Savings Catcher isn’t catching as many savings as time goes on.   Very disappointing."

At least I haven’t found where yet (I’ve been using the Walmart grocery pickup order (app) since the first day it started in my town).   Walmart really missed on the new version and unfortunately I was FORCED to upgrade.  With there was another store in my town that provides grocery curbside.

I was told to reinstall the app (which I’ve done) so we shall see if that helps. And I cannot believe that a company as big as Walmart cannot let you submit a receipt, when it’s their fault, in order to get your (potential) rewards, as they are so quick to advertise.

Having to remember to “submit” to savings catcher once you use the app is horrible. I keep forgetting to do that. Receipts should automatically submit themselves....that’s why we pay with the app!!!! Hello????? Anyone there????? If you don’t want to fix that then at least ask us if we want to submit or something. We have enough going on!

But it really did have good deals and everything was made in the USA. My how this place has changed, it has fallen so far from what it used to be! Yet I’ve remained a loyal customer. "
556,the1nonly85,"December 2, 2018",1,"Updated review I use the Walmart app mainly for savings catcher. This portion of the app gets worse and worse over time. The new Walmart pay idea is extremely stupid. The fact you can't scan your paper receipt anymore, also stupid. I tried to scan the barcode at the store to submit my receipt for savings catcher. Did it work?? Of course not. Why should you have to click submit receipt for it to go under savings catcher? Who ever made the changes to this app isn't the brightest crayon in the box. Please change it back. This app is extremely frustrating and now getting to be annoying. Smh walmart."
557,Kathy Hall,"January 31, 2020",3,"Incomplete Walmart needs to give we customers a contact phone number to resolve problems, cancel items, add, ask a question or just to give instructions. It is very difficult trying to contact a live person and it appears that is purposeful. "
558,titan511,"August 28, 2019",2,"Without Savings Catcher... The abysmally slow loading app is just NOT convenient! Opening this app to use Wal-Mart pay takes longer than 40 seconds just to load the initial opening of the app, then the auto login takes another 15 seconds or so, add that to the amount of time it takes to initiate the pay feature and the whole process is shockingly less than just paying with a chipped debit card, albeit without the snazzy virtual receipt feature. "
559,Conti2004,"August 11, 2019",4,"Need an update Whenever you are using Walmart pay, it doesn’t let you choose the card to use and keep.  For example if you have 3 cards and one is default, and you attempt to use a different card it doesn’t save it to use that time it defaults back to the original card and if you don’t catch it quick enough you are purchasing items on the wrong card"
560,Seamsm0m,"June 13, 2018",2,"If it would only authenticate probably, it might be good. SO irritating to frequently get all the way through an order and to then receive an “authentication error, try again later.” This hasn’t happened once or twice, but 8 times easy. I’ve attempted using this app at least 15 times and almost half the time it gives me this error message. If this problem could be resolved, it would be a great app. It is terribly frustrating. I usually end up going through the website to order my items."
561,Sarahs Sweets,"June 14, 2018",3,"Only downfall is you only have 7 days to get credit for your purchases I love that savings catcher exists, it is awesome! The only downfall for being a very busy mommy, who works full time is that if you submit your receipt after 7 days you don’t get the credit for it. It would be great if you got even 10 days to submit them, and still get the credit for it. Overall it is a really great thing to have, and definitely helps when you fall on hard times."
562,FlyNmom,"June 26, 2018",3,Too many managers! Not enough workers I requested help at the deli counter & 2 managers....had to find an employee to help me! I had to wait for employee!?!! Can’t managers jump in & help?!?!!
563,JWRwillSucceed,"June 27, 2018",2,"Waste of time as of recently. This app has always had an issue with occasionally not recognizing ANY items on my receipts. I understand that might be possible on occasion when I only purchase a few items. However, in the past 1-2 months it hasn't recognized several receipts (about 5 out of 6) that were $100-$200+ worth of groceries and such. It usually compares to around 35-40 stores due to this very populated area. So there's no way that in spending that much money it couldn't find even one item at another store. Disappointing."
564,kalanifaye,"July 11, 2018",1,FRAUD Hit or miss with online transactions. I purchased a few things with no problem. Then made a new purchase later on and that was it. I check my bank statements and see that I was charged for a 3rd transaction that I DID NOT MAKE. I even checked to see if they may have double charged me for something I already purchased but no.. it was a random amount. I tried contacting Walmart customer service and they never got back with me. Turns out the Fraud Dept. contacted me and after going to the bank we found out it was Walmart that compromised my card details and made that random transaction on my account.

566,Watchguy2,"August 24, 2018",2,"Invalid Links--Typical WalMart App Developers Incompetence This specifically pertains to online ordering for store pickup.  The emails received provide a link to this app, but guess what? The link navigates to the home page and the order help/status for checking in to pick up is nowhere to be found.  That's what is called a broken link, but in typical Walmart app quality it is called lousy developers.  I highly recommend hiring at least one QA (Quality Assurance) to test an app before it is released.  I know I am asking a lot, but I would also request that QA person not be from AR."

Sorry: Cumbersome, Not too user-friendly as before. "
568,TammyMalone,"November 12, 2018",1,"WORST UPDATE EVER You can no longer manually add receipts to savings catcher.  I have no cell service inside the stores in my area and the Walmart WiFi works only about 2% of the time IF you are standing in the right spot at the right time.  WiFi is not secure in the stores so I am taking a chance IF I decide to try to use it.  By chance, i was able to use the app at checkout the other day and it deducted my purchase from my savings catcher balance WITHOUT my permission. I use my savings catcher money for special purchases at holidays and that one time use depleted my account.  WE NEED TO HAVE A WAY TO MANUALLY ADD RECEIPTS AND AN OPTION TO USE WHATEVER FUNDS WE WANT AT CHECKOUT!"
569,Sigl-Tempus,"January 18, 2019",2,"Not a good product. Requires multiple apps without explaining why, clunky implementation of mobile paying, will require physical security checks at seemingly random intervals without notification. Personally led me to a situation where I had to cancel a purchase because they wanted me to have the card I was using for the mobile payment system on my person. If you have to always have the physical card, why would you ever use the mobile payments? I’ll stick with Target, as they have a better environment for mobile users."
570,Solon-x,"January 21, 2018",3,"Slow and Clunky The mobile development team needs to spend some time on the user experience.  The app is a bit slow and clunky in places. An example is the savings catcher service. Clicks to enter and navigate this functioning are extremely slow making the user think the click did not register, so they click again and again.  Suddenly, the app comes back to life and responds to all of the clicks.  It’s just not crisp and efficient.  It feels cheap."

I submitted a receipt in April which was received and never received the results. It states I can resubmit but that is not true when you only have so many days to submit a receipt after your purchase. I will stop using it and go back to the manual way if submitting my receipts."
575,Fruityogurt,"July 6, 2018",2,"Prices Not Being Matched I have looked at other adds do know what’s on sale and makes it a point to purchase those items at Walmart. Unfortunately, Walmart is not honoring the lowest prices found at other grocery stores. I have purchased chips that were on sale for $1.49, kraft cheese $1.99 but Walmart doesn’t seem to catch the difference. To me, going to the actual store with the items on sale. Is better because I know I’m getting the sale price. Whereas Walmart seems to not hold up to their word...And Walmart prices are much higher. Rollback? No!!"

It’s now July 11th and still no results. It still says “receipt received” but no other details. Clearly beyond their suggested wait time for processing. This same situation happened in April. After about 2 months it said “receipt not eligible”. And now there is no easy way to contact someone for help. Sometimes receipts do process, but never as quickly as they used to. Very disappointed."
577,Baylei T,"August 13, 2018",5,Love. I like that I can see everything that I wanna purchase and make sure they have r before I even leave and get my baby packed up. I also like that I can See what I bought (impulse buys are always either great or crappy) sonif I like something and I forgot its name. I can look up and see what I bought before to get it again! Over all a really good helpful app to have in hand!
578,Mamichula_85,"November 8, 2018",5,Great app I love all the updates they have on this app now. Makes everything I do so much easier. The only thing I wish would be added was a way to add a nickname to my credit cards. When I use walmart pay its confusing to just see the end numbers and not be sure what card it is. A nickname would make it so much easier to choose from.
579,xXxdino.loverxXx,"February 4, 2019",1,"Savings Catcher I use to love the savings catcher. I had quite a bit saved up to use for Christmas. Since it was changed over, the cashier I had didn’t know what she was doing, and ended up spending the money on it that I was saving. It also happened to me again the other day, when I only had $2 on it, and a cashier didn’t do it right, and used it up. I do not like using the Walmart Pay to do savings catcher. It’s too much of a hassle. I will most likely delete the app if it’s not back to the way it was when you just scanned the receipt. I’d rather scan the receipt. It’s so much easier."
580,Jthowell20,"November 2, 2017",4,"Missing one thing. Overall the app is great. It’s easy to use and works well. I especially like the feature that lets you see where an item is located in the store. However, I wish the app had an online order section. It used to have one until a recent update, and it was very helpful for tracking orders and reviewing what you’ve ordered. I hope this feature is brought back soon!"

In addition, I make random stops to get things between my big grocery trips. I feel that there should be some sort of reward for your loyal customers.

582,Ashmatandkay,"June 17, 2018",5,"Wonderful app! This is an amazing app for several reasons, my personal favorite, is you can s your receipts for later returns or exchanges, without having to keep up with the paper receipt, in addition, it also helps me track what I buy, and even shows me pictures of the items, which makes the easy to find again in the store!"
583,lola0467,"June 26, 2018",1,Do not use this app if you want to know if an item is available at a store I just spent 3 hours of my time going from Walmart to Walmart in my area looking for a specific item. I went to three different Walmarts because the app said the item was in stock in all three. None of them had the item. When I ask employees for help they just look on the shelf where it’s supposed to be and tell me it’s out of stock. One employee told me that they have people ask for items all the time that are supposed to be in stock at the store but they are not! Save yourself the frustration...don’t use the app.
584,CONEJO3RD,"June 27, 2018",3,Catch-a-Savings It was so great in the beginning. There were more stores to challenge so you got more money. I cash out once a year to collect my savings and each year I started getting less and less back. Because of this amazing opportunity this made me only shop at Walmart because I didn’t have to look for sells at the near-by stores because there is no need because of this feature. I was telling everybody about catch-a-savings. I still love it though‼️
585,Jen2me,"November 10, 2018",1,"Frustrated! All of a sudden they no longer let you use your Walmart Grocery receipt for savings catcher. FYI no one wants to actually shop in your ridiculous store bc you move products around daily to make us spend more money. News flash, I don’t spend more money...you upset me so much that I end up paying extra at your competitors store just to avoid having to walk in your store. This has just made it to where you lose my business completely. I’d rather have the same service and pay for the pick up fee plus the extra cost per item than to mess with you. Bye!"
586,Bingoer2631,"November 29, 2018",2,Submitting Receipts I don’t like to always use my e-gift cards but now that you have changed how we add receipts to savings catcher I haven’t added many and I used to use this app a lot. But since it’s been made that the Walmart Pay is the only way to submit them and it automatically takes off your E-gift card when I don’t want it to use it. I have decided that I will just use all the other Money Saving apps instead of this one as I choose when and where I use the money I get back. This is very disappointing to me as a user.
587,Sponge_32,"February 13, 2020",1,"Why did you change something that was working I use the Walmart app all the time and used to love it.

When I get to the store, no one can find it anywhere in the store. I wasted a half hour at each of two different stores the first time. Even with their associates special web location app, it can’t be found. If you find something on this app without an aisle listing, don’t bother - it’s fake, so you’ll come to the store and buy whatever they really have. Don’t you have enough money without resorting to this, Walmart?"
589,barbtexas,"October 1, 2019",1,Store pick up should post the hours of pick up when you’re ordering online. My online order last night had no problem taking my money out of my checking account and telling me that I had seven days to pick up my order. However I didn’t say that order pick up stops at 8 PM. Kind a hard to pick it up when I don’t get off until 10. Nobody at the store can you help me get a refund of my money. Nobody at the store even knew what they were talking about. Waited 26 minutes for somebody to figure out what I Needed to do to get my order. And they refused to refund my money.
590,Megs from the Midwest,"May 4, 2018",1,"Worthless This is the most worthless app ever. It won’t let me choose a Walmart anywhere else other then Richmond, CA. Okay, so I turn on my location services trying to help it out. But apparently this Walmart I’m currently standing in doesn’t exist. And this has been up and running at least 10-15 years. All I wanted was to order one photo to pick up and apparently I can’t do that unless I go on the other side of the country. The pharmacy part of the app is useless too.

I have spoken to them in store and they don’t know how to fix it. I use Wal-Mart as my pharmacy and I would love to be able to just scan, refill and be able to use the mobile pick up. Is there anything that can be done to help????"

I buy $200 worth of groceries each week through online pick-up. This new change gives me no way to process the receipt. Even if I do shop in the store, the credits given must be used immediately so getting a dollar or two off your bill doesn’t feel like much of a reward. Previously, if you were loyal to Walmart, you could accumulate a nice amount to savings. Now there’s no incentive to be loyal."

When I check the app hours later, it still says items are in stock.  This has happened with several stores now.  A person is potentially exposed to COVID-19 EVERY TIME they go in the store, to leave empty handed when the app says the items are in store.  Why can’t a company as big as Walmart in this time with our society facing the problem it has, figure out a way to fix this issue?  Don’t put a feature in an app that is misleading!!!!!!"

Is it possible to either add the option to pay my Walmart credit card via the app, or create a separate app to do that? That would be truly helpful.

However when I checked the fed ex website it still appeared to be shipping that day. So I am writing this review to counter my other one. Also try and make the shipping time more accurate (I had a mental breakdown when I saw it was delayed when it really wasn’t)
618,Linda960,"October 11, 2019",5,Satisfied Honestly I don’t shop on the app because I am in Walmart just about everyday. I use this app for when I go shopping and honestly I am glad for the search engine. The app picks up on my store location and can tell me where an item is in a matter of seconds. It gets me in and out of the store 10X faster. I definitely recommend using.
619,Anitapitabread,"September 20, 2019",1,"Price checked no longer works! I updated my Walmart app today and then went shopping. Now every single thing I scanned in store to price check told me that the product was unavailable in store and did not give me in store pricing, only online pricing. I don’t have time to run to a price checker with every single thing I’m buying. If things were neat and clean in my stores and tagged properly this would not be as big of an issue, but things are almost never in the correct spot on the shelf or the sticker/shelf price does not correspond to the ACTUAL price of items. Fix your scanner!"
620,Airishdreamer,"November 18, 2017",5,"Frustrating They keep changing the app. It used to be simple. Now you have to search for the savings catcher and it does not show you your cash back unless you click on the rewards button. Also, I recently reset my phone and have to reinstall all of my apps and now this one won’t even load. I’m really frustrated!"
621,Glockster27,"June 3, 2018",4,Great App I have used this app since December 2014. I have saved a lot of money and will continue to use the app. 
622,Cristinaroscoe,"June 13, 2018",5,Love it Love the new app because now I can scan my receipts like I used too except that now you have a search bar and you can type in and look for products you bought in the past. I sometimes do that to see when my filter needs to be changed or what oil and filter I need for my car etc. Just love that new feature.
623,M Ashby,"June 22, 2018",5,"This app does everything! This app is amazing. If you need to know what isle an item is in just search and if the store carries it, it will show the location! It even knows what store you are in! Savings catcher! Refill prescriptions! Order online! Walmart is Always adding to this app making it better and better. It is so user friendly too!!"
624,josan.delva,"July 13, 2018",5,"Really useful! Someone that I know recommended this app to me. Love the fact that you have Wi-Fi internet connection at a Walmart store if you have this app. Very useful. Tells you the aisle where the item is and most of the prices. Like the savings catcher tool. So far, I have encountered no issues. In the near future, would love for the app to include the prices for produce (fruits, vegetables, etc.)"
625,Brittanynicoleee,"November 11, 2018",1,"*Eye roll* I hate the new update. Having the savings catcher be exclusively Walmart pay is ridiculous . I used to use my Walmart app all the time to can products when I didn’t know the price, to shop online , and use the savings catcher like crazy . I hardly ever use Walmart pay and I feel like I am being cheated out of money because I don’t have the time to shop around for the best price when everything is a one stop shop at Walmart . Bring back the ability to scan receipts for savings catcher and make everyone happier . It’s not like Walmart isn’t making enough money 😂💁🏼‍♀️"
626,Uuptyyu,"December 18, 2018",2,Bad update This used to be one of my favorite apps and I told everyone about it. My main reason for using it was you could shop with confidence at Walmart and know you were going to get the lowest-priced by then scanning with the savings catcher app. Now as a person who Manages my budget by using cash it no longer offers that savings to me because they force you to use a credit card or even a debit card. I do like the feature that they track your receipts but otherwise I’m extremely disappointed!!
627,Catbrossart,"April 2, 2020",2,"Pandemic fail for Walmart At a time when we should not be gathering in stores, making items available “in store only” instead of available for delivery is just wrong.  I don’t care if it is two days or weeks for delivery, being forced to go find it in person though makes Walmart part of the problem instead of part of the solution by using their distribution experience to get high demand products to customers with the least amount of contact possible."
628,Murphys Dau,"April 1, 2020",5,"My First Order - 4-1-20 Checked everything when I got home, everything was perfect.  Really loved this.  I may never shop in person again.  Online is great.  Alisha brought my stuff out, carefully put it all in the back seat and wouldnt even take a tip.  She was very nice and should receive a bonus that the store gives out.  Enjoyable experience."
629,RaoTheFarmer,"February 27, 2020",3,"Online Grocery/Shop Startup Page It has become so annoying after the recent walmart app where when you open the app, you have to select grocery online or shop. For people like me, who do not use the grocery option, this option doesn’t make sense at all. There should either be an option to default the startup, remember last selection or keep apps separate as i think they were before."

631,Lor-son,"June 24, 2018",4,"Best I've tried The Walmart app is the best shopping app I've seen so far. It works perfectly for me every time including Savings Catcher, price-checking, and Walmart pay. Electronic receipts are great! Saves paper, and they are always easy to find…"
632,cbpar,"June 28, 2018",1,Now it’s crap Installed app over two years ago and I’ve ordered numerous items using it.  I’ve also used it to alert Pick Up desk I was in store.  I really liked the app.  
633,Tootsie51,"July 31, 2018",3,"Mediocre This Walmart is only average but has the potential to be great.  Many times the shelves are poorly stocked.  In some cases the only brand available is Great Value and I personally do not like most of their products.  Many of the sales people are visiting with each other rather than paying attention to their jobs.  On the positive side, almost all ot the employees are friendly and helpful when I ask them for help.  This store is always clean and has clean restrooms."
634,Ruffrach,"August 2, 2018",5,Money money money savings I love Wal Mart!!! I have started using their grocery pick up and it has saved me a small fortune. Our family doesn’t spend as much money on groceries because I only purchase the things I need. We are not tempted to put unnecessary items in our cart!!! Thank you!! I drive 40 miles one way to use the pick up service!!!
635,KoowanPStark,"October 10, 2018",1,"Beware the money transfer feature The money transfer feature is a massive FAIL. A client tried to pay me with it and the app just throws up an error message and freezes. Even worse, I never did receive the money and he lost the money for weeks as he was bounced from one customer service center to another, finally ending up at a financial company that barely spoke English. At very least, this feature is disastrously badly implemented in the app and should be removed. Don’t risk your hard earned money with this nonsense. Use a more trustworthy and reliable system like PayPal or Venmo."
636,brittanykaymiss,"November 2, 2018",1,"Savings catcher only with Walmart pay I used this app all the time. My boyfriend and I always scanned our receipts into the app so we could use the savings catcher feature... however now it’s only available when you use Walmart pay. Since my boyfriend normally goes to Walmart and brings the receipts home for me to scan, (his phone is strictly for work, and outside apps are prohibited)  we are no longer able to take advantage of the feature. Please just go back to scanning receipts. Perhaps also keep the Walmart pay feature available for those who use that as well??"
637,Hunter1324593,"November 4, 2018",1,"Savings Catcher The Savings Catcher was a lot easier to use before they changed the settings with Walmart Pay...now the only way to submit receipts is through Walmart Pay at the check out?!?!...That is so inconvenient when you pay cash or your actual card for your items...they need to change it back to the old way and keep the Savings Catcher and Walmart Pay separate!! It was better to have them separate, now that they are combined it’s harder to submit receipts....Please change back to the old way and separate the Savings Catcher from Walmart Pay."
638,Crazydude0,"December 30, 2019",1,"The worst When reviewing my purchase history, it is extremely difficult to tell which comments (shipped, ready for pickup, etc) are referring to which items as soon as you have more than one single group of items there. If you’ve looked there with anything more than one order then you should know what I’m talking about. I wish I could attach a photo!"
639,Fox5497,"July 20, 2019",2,"Not worth it I downloaded this app recently and went to my local Walmart to test out the scanner functionality. Out of 10 items I scanned, the app actually pulled up only two items. The other eight items were “not found” or it just didn’t pull up anything. I scanned a couple of clearance baseball cards packs. Nothing! I scanned couple of store tag random barcodes, it tells not not recognized. You got two stars cuz I got two hits. Don’t waste your time. I’m deleting this app from my phone after this review."
640,Ashyg91,"May 28, 2018",5,"Used to be Great until the “new look” update I have been using this app for a.m few years now, I used to order all the time.

Please Fix"
641,ApGirl14,"June 10, 2018",1,"What’s wrong with Savings Catcher?? I have been using Savings Catcher for quite a while now and never had any issues with it, but it seems like since the last update, I am not getting any results from the receipts I have submitted. I have receipts anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months ago, and there has been no response as to whether no lower prices were found or if I got money back. "
642,ghcnkk,"June 13, 2018",1,"No savings I have spoken with several people and since the Change to your savings app I have not had any increases.  So I started asking family and friends, and co workers they too said nothing has been added to their accounts.   I have had a few people tell me they have shopped a different store locally and found items of the same cheaper and have brought it back to the store and returned it and made their purchase else where.

Another lady and I waited 40minutes to get someone to get our pickup orders.  Excuses we were given; on lunch, working with three other customers, and people just called in and they were short of workers.  No real acceptable excuse.  When people call in and there a a large number, you should have people on call to come in at times like this."
645,Lightning Rod LR,"June 29, 2018",5,Truck drivers getting in stores to park and shop Sam Walton would be ashamed of booting trucks that drivers parking in the store lots to shop and pay then get the truck boots taken off. Most drivers are not going to go to Walmart anymore because of being disappointed for trying to save money. This app won’t help Drivers who live in the trucks.
646,Icg689,"July 26, 2018",3,What’s the point. I don’t understand the point of taking the time to scan my receipts when half the time it won’t even process them. I have quite a few receipts that never showed whether I got money back or not and then they just turn to ineligible receipts. I usually put my receipts in on Saturday and usually have the results by maybe Tuesday. Tired of jacking with trying to scan the receipts when it’s not even going to search for lower prices.
647,mellie_elie,"September 21, 2018",1,"I LOVED this app...but you ruined it!! Whoever’s decision it was to strictly submit receipts through Walmart pay clearly is trying to limit the discounts we get. Because now, if I don’t have money in the bank, and I have to use cash I just lose out on savings. I used those savings to help make ends meet. When I don’t have enough for food I used my savings cash. I lost my job and as a single mom it helped me out. You just pretty much screwed me. But I get it! Big business...money in the pockets of the exects and screw the little people! ONE STAR! I will be deleting my app as it is no longer useful to me! ✌🏼👎🏼1️⃣⭐️"
648,Pamhearttam,"November 16, 2018",3,Bring Back Receipt Scanning This app was wonderful UNTIL they changed the Savings Catcher aspect so you can only submit receipts if you use Walmart pay. This just doesn’t work for me so I can no longer use the Savings Catcher which I used to love. Bring back can to submit!!
649,fnsipper,"February 8, 2019",1,Savings catcher Not everyone trusts paying for stuff using their phone. I use cash most of the time and I can’t scan my receipts anymore. There’s always some kind of data breach for websites where people’s bank information and personal information gets jacked. For this reason I will not put any card information on any app. Bring back scanned receipts. Besides half of the employees are to stupid to even understand how this works. I’ve gotten behind a few customers at Walmart trying to use the app and couldn’t figure it out and none of the cashiers are familiar with it!
650,Bring Touch Back,"June 11, 2018",4,Viewing Receipt Love the super convenient way to pay and how the receipt is automatically sent to phone. Makes it quick to submit receipt and not lose it. I also love how you can see the image for each item. Makes it easy to scan over. However I wish the discount amount was viewable vs just the total. I can’t remember what the roll back price was or some discounts.
651,Krisistheman86💩,"July 20, 2018",5,"Live this app But... This app has everything that an everyday W shopper must have. There is nothing wrong with this app itself. There is a problem with corporate enforcing that the aisle identification placards be clearly visible at each aisle. In summation, the app is great but corporate needs to make sure each and every WM store has clearly visible aisle identification placards like “K5 or J3”. Thanks WM I know you will figure this out ."
652,TamiMrs,"August 24, 2018",5,Finally signed up! My friend kept encouraging me to get the app and I just checked and I have four dollars waiting for me. That’s four dollars that I literally would’ve thrown in the trash. I also love that I can scan any product in my house and find out what it would cost me at Walmart!!! And then I can also find out which Walmarts have it in stock.
653,a.baker912,"January 19, 2019",2,"Loved it... than it updated I loved the ability to just scan my receipt or punch in the receipt number from my Walmart grocery app and get discounts; however, with the last update the ability to scan the receipts are gone and I can not input my receipt numbers from the grocery app. The only way for you to use the savings catcher is to use Walmart pay at checkout. I can’t even use savings catcher on the grocery app anymore..... Walmart you HAD something good then you went and changed it."

You can still limit the amount and keep is safe ! You are bigger idiots than we ever dreamed you could be. But I bet the CEO got his outside a store and the Board of Directors has theirs too.

Instead, you have to go into the settings and change your preferred store. I have like 15 Walmart’s within 20 miles of me, I’m not going to do that for each store. Take some lessons from Target’s app, it’s fantastic!"
657,Contractor Bil,"December 1, 2019",1,Not enough time I’m sure we all find that were short on time on a daily basis. And I’m probably not the only one that does not have enough time to wait nearly a minute sometimes longer for the app to open and Allow me to open Walmart pay.

So I went to the Notifications settings and turned off “Events and Specials” while leaving on “Pharmacy” and “Pickup”. Well, this morning I received an alert for “Ellen DeGeneres’ Faves”.  Unless she takes the same medications that I do, I’m not interested. Please fix this. If I didn’t rely on Walmart for my prescriptions, I’d certainly delete this app."

You could just scan your receipt and get the savings. Then they took away the ability to scan your receipt, you could only get the savings if you used Walmart Pay. Now they took away the savings catcher altogether. All of this happened in the span of one year. It was all just a ploy to get you to use their app. There’s absolutely NO reason to use Walmart Pay now. The app is not secure and you get no additional savings. Such a disappointment."
660,Tinkerbelltes,"October 22, 2017",5,Horrible The prices on the app and the prices in the store are so far off its ridiculous. I found an item on the app that I could only purchase in the store so I drove to the store and the price was 3x higher than what the app had! They wouldn’t even honor the price or give me a discount. This app just takes up space and not worth the download!

I only wanted the application on my iPhone, and not my I-Pad ! It’s seems like what has been downloaded to one Device has, or may have critically disabled my ability to use my settings!

I hardly shop there anymore..  Shame on you Walmart!!!

Walmart pay has worked twice since the change. I have to pay with debit, credit or cash which means I can’t submit my receipt to savings catcher. If you use this app for other things it works pretty good for credit card and shopping, but again if your looking to use savings catcher and the Walmart pay then don’t waste your memory."

Went in there yesterday and a Walmart employee-lady in a yellow vest walked over to get a buggy; I had my arms full and was struggling to get a buggy. She got a buggy and walked off never even offering to help me and she knew I was struggling. The buggies were stuck together. I started to throw my items on the floor and walk out but I was raised better than that! She just looked at me and walked off with a buggy. She was on the clock too!
674,Soulsummer,"September 20, 2018",1,New Savings Catcher Terms.. What the heck! Why are you taking away the option to scan receipts??? I HAVE to use a combination of cash and or cards when I shop. Not everyone wants to store their cards on their phones to shop with either. I have to save paper receipts when I shop for disabled clients. They need them for their spending ledgers. You are taking this away as they rely on the extra savings for other needs with the savings catcher. You are also punishing everyone else that shops with cash. It wasn’t inconvenient at all to scan receipts! 
675,Bwhitney72,"October 8, 2018",1,Walmart pay is horrible I love savings catcher. Using it for years. Had no problems. Scanned my receipts. But now required to use Walmart pay in order to use savings catcher. When I tried using my debit card in Walmart pay. It locked up Walmart’s entire cash register. Had to completely rescan whole order. Employees hate it. It doesn’t work correctly and now I’m being forced to use it for savings catcher? Nope not happening. Not that I matter to that big company but they lost one customers marketing habits. We all know that’s the purpose of it. To track what consumers do.

Whenever you ask a store employee where something is, they mention this app. After I look up the item sometimes I have to find someone again to ask them where the aisle is, half the time they don’t know. Once you locate the aisle there is still a chance it’s not in stock even though the app says it is."

I do all my shopping in one stop at WalMart plus they have savings catcher I don’t run from store to store any more.  I just turn into the savings catcher they do the comparing and give me back the money I would have saved but burned up in gas running from store to  store I can live with that!
685,ManlyHomeschooler,"June 14, 2018",5,"Extremely Useful. I am very careful about installing apps. If I’m going to give it space on my phone, it has to tow the line. This one is a keeper! Walmart App has multiple functions, such as scan barcodes for price, locate items in store, giving you money back by checking local ads for you, and more! Highly recommended."
686,Areviewer0202,"October 31, 2018",1,"Update is BAD I’ve happily used this app for a couple years UNTIL this newest App update. The new update does not allow you the convenience of electronically saving receipts UNLESS you are willing to use a credit, debit, charge or gift card as payment. Cash is a secondary form of payment as funds are automatically withdrawn from your selected form of electronic payment. Using cash to pay seems to be a secondary form of payment. Your Savings Catcher finds are automatically withdrawn too. Until Walmart fixes this “convenient “ form of electronic payment, I would not recommend this app."
687,The 4 girl gang,"November 19, 2018",1,"THIS APP IS GOING DOWN HILL I am outraged that Walmart has made a switch to only allow you to use the Saving Catcher feature with the Walmart Pay. I find this to be an in convinced and a security risk. This may not be the same for others but it is the case for me. I strongly believe that the Walmart app should allow for two options, to manually put in your receipts or you the Walmart Pay. This app use to save me money but I cannot make a drastic switch like this and risk my identity just to save a few bucks here and there. Please do re update your app to the old way of using Savings Catcher!"
688,John 103,"November 26, 2018",1,Used to work better than it does now Ever since they took away the ability to scan your receipt I have almost quit using this app. It is very hard to remember and it is inconvenient to have to scan a barcode at the register to use the savings catcher. Not only that but it automatically takes what I have saved and uses it. I don’t want to load a card to it because I refuse to have my credit card information hanging out there. It has just gotten to the point where I believe that they don’t want you to use it and save money.
689,NavyHazard NVHZ,"April 1, 2019",2,Reviews on items that you didn’t buy You can right a review on things you didn’t buy and it’s skeptical because someone can write a 5 star review on something that’s absolutely terrible that doesn’t work or something else and Walmart allows things like this to happen because they haven’t changed it yet. Hopefully after this review they will take this into consideration and fix it and remove the reviews that didn’t buy the items that have fake reviews on them.
690,Miabambi01,"June 13, 2018",5,I love Walmart I love the app and savings catcher this is a great concept everyone should follow Walmart better yet never mind I like that Walmart is doing this and gives me the difference I am amazed though how many people still do not know about the savings catcher I have started a lot of people on this and told them Walmart is the only place they need to shop love the app
691,Mackenzie/Amanda,"June 14, 2018",5,Love this app Had this app for about 1 year and I have made back $105. I love that it saves my receipts so I never have to worry about keeping them.

693,time sensitve,"October 1, 2018",3,Walmart Valley Stream I shop this store because it is the only super center in NY. What I dislike is the fact that they have replaced cashiers with to many scan and go. If you have a weight items sometimes you can’t find them and then must wait for a sales person to override and then type it in. Also you cannot do your bottle return at the scan and go. You then either wait for your next visit or stand on a line.
694,Spknwds,"October 31, 2018",1,No more scanning receipts I loved the feature for scanning receipts and saving money. It helped out a lot and was very convenient for me. Imagine my disappointment yesterday after I went shopping and got to my car to scan my receipt and the option was not available! Where was the notification about that? I certainly didn’t get any. And to top it off I now have to use Walmart pay in order to even have my receipt saved? I do not like this new update at all. I guess I will now have to shop elsewhere. Especially when I prefer paying cash.

I had to wait 20 minutes in the store to get ahold of an idiotic customer service rep who couldn’t give me a straight answer and agreed that it didn’t make sense but couldn’t do anything.

I like it! Y’all should try it.

And the reward dollars you get is a plus !!"

Spoke to store managers and contacted via the app. In addition many Items on the shelf are not in the app?  No one seems to be able to help or care. Seems to me that this is not how Walmart intended this to work. I do like the store and hope this is something that gets fixed.

The fact that Walmart corporate says that each store can choose to use or not says a lot about their concern on whether the app is used or not.

That’s a really stupid move because I don’t shop with Walmart pay but still want to have a record of my receipts and use the savings catcher.

Most of the time there are long lines and you just want to get your groceries and go. Now you want to make the lines longer by have someone pull out their phone and scan something. This is crazy. The line are normally 20 people in 3 or 4 registers. Even in self checkout.  I just moved to a new community and the store starts closing procedures at 7pm for a 12 am closing.

755,CTYankee85,"November 20, 2018",1,Bring back receipt upload!!! I totally agree with Rtiger2. I do not use Walmart Pay either and do not plan on using it either. I would like to see you bring the receipt upload back so that users have a choice for how they enter their shopping receipts. I have been reading the reviews and see that many of your long time users of the app seem to be unhappy with the new updates you’ve made.  Please listen to your users and bring it back.  I am considering not using the app and not shopping at Walmart as often as I do currently.
756,rh5969,"January 10, 2019",3,"No way to print a receipt I had to convert to Walmart Pay to continue to use Savings Catcher.  In the process, this change caused me to lose a printed receipt at the checkout. At first, when reviewing receipts in the Purchase History section I could use the options and print my receipt to my wireless printer. Now the printing option has disappeared!  The only option now is to email a pic of your receipt to yourself! Please fix this!!!"

I have now gone back three different times as well as called twice asking for the status of my refund and nobody can tell me anything except to give it a few more days. Today I was told that this is happening to several different people and they can’t get a hold of corporate to inquire why refunds aren’t going through. Stay away from Walmart. They can surely take the money out of your account rather quickly but getting it returned is a hassle.
758,smalls1004,"November 9, 2019",1,Skip the line returns There is no point for the skip the line return on the app. I got told multiple times by the store to get in the regular line to use the “skip the line “ feature for returns. I haven’t even attempted the one for the pharmacy. They also won’t price match things sold by Walmart at the Walmart store. I can see if it’s sold by another company on the website but when it’s Walmart’s own stuff it’s really crazy they won’t match their own price in the store. I am choosing more and more to go to target because of Walmart’s customer service.
759,ScottyDR,"June 24, 2019",5,"Good App Overall I like the app it is very useful and I use it quite often. One thing I wish would be added is the scan barcode in the 3D Touch, so that you don’t have to open the app first to start scanning for a price or product info. That would make the app even more convenient."
760,JohnnyDisMe,"October 5, 2017",2,"Could be much better Your price matching feature usually comes back with a message saying that none of the items purchased could be found or qualify for the feature which is completely errant. Additionally, the purchase history page just says “Oops, not working” and tells me to check my connection when many other features on the app work fine (searching for products to buy, etc). Please do some more work on your app. Thanks."
761,jbug1976,"October 20, 2017",3,Credit card section I think the bigger drawback to the app is the credit card section it doesn't exist either there needs to be a section added or a whole entirely new app dedicated to because using the mobile website barely works for that portion of the website it just a broken link most of the time???!!! It’s strange I have to to go through a browser for the credit card section ???

So when Walmart offers a survey through the app and asks for my receipt info, I’d expect to be able to enter it. But guess what? It’s not automatically captured and I don’t have a printed receipt to enter the requested info. Kinda ridiculous."
763,AnoarB,"February 27, 2018",1,Horrible scam. Avoid!! The App used to scan receipts but they updated it and it does not scan them anymore no matter how many times you try. So you have to manually enter it and even then it doesn’t work sometimes. Obviously this is to get people to avoid entering receipts for the so called savings catcher that they advertise or for possible returns making it harder to enter a receipt so many people don’t have the time to do it. The bean counters at WalMart are obviously in charge of the scam of an App. If I had time I’d report them to whatever government agency regulated them.

Other than that, I love my store."

I assume this is not a bug and was a decision made by Walmart corporate to fatten their wallets. I see a ton of negative feedback after this change.

769,Stacy1977,"November 11, 2018",1,"Savings catcher I’m extremely disappointed that you can no longer scan your receipts to savings catcher. You have to use Walmart pay to submit them.

When I got home I discovered it was because it was not updated with a new patch that was released sometime today and instead of telling me to update the app it simply said “Please try again in a moment.”  It was embarrassing that I could not pay for my groceries and just goes to show that you can not rely on any app to make a purchase in person.  I am going back to never trusting apps.

I don’t like that it keeps track of what I buy and constantly nags and hassles me to reorder especially items I rarely purchase. I bought a fabric softener ball a few weeks ago. I’ll probably never buy another as long as I live but the app constantly nags me to buy another. The store I shop in Greenfield, IN. Is ALWAYS out of something I need and want to buy. It is very frustrating that I can’t give away my money for something I want because they are ALWAYS out of SOMETHING."

This new update that now requires me to use my Walmart pay in order to submit a receipt is TERRIBLE. I will be deleting this app and no longer using it once my last receipts have been finalized. It’s no longer convenient for me. I do not wish to have my debit card attached and it’s too much of a hassle to add a gift card EVERY time I’m in Walmart (which is pretty much daily). What purpose does this serve for customers? Even the cashiers are confused and not sure how it works now.

It would be nice to have a manual option for these cases. However, I like all other uses for the app except the savings catcher switch over."

Could you please fix this so I can get thru with this for in the future if I ever decide to return once again and NOT wait in line? Thank you!"
826,Raven Sparrow,"April 10, 2019",1,Lost prescription I used the app to transfer and refill a prescription and somehow it got lost in the system. It’s still lost. I called the original pharmacy and they confirmed that it was transfers and the place but that pharmacy doesn’t have it and can not tell me where it went. I even got an email saying the prescription was being filled. No location but there was a phone number to the pharmacy I chose to transfer to. In the end I am having to call my doctor and hope they will send a new prescription order in time.

828,TKsixNine,"May 1, 2020",1,"Garbage Other (original) app was pretty good. This one crashes a lot. Other irritating features include adding items to your cart, only to have them disappear. Seriously, I added several items, double checked the quantity, then clicked on cart, saw the items at the top of the list. Then saw them disappear. Out of stock perhaps? I was able reproduce this bug with a number of different items. This version needs a lot more testing/quality control. I’ve deleted it and reinstalled the original."

We have been using the grocery app. to buy food and have really enjoyed Picking up our orders. Juan was Great-  Very professional and polite. The energy and effort he brought out to the parking lot was refreshing. Thanks!  And actually all the delivery persons have been very helpful and accommodating!
830,Reneefromillinois,"April 9, 2018",1,"Do not trust Savings catcher! I spend $200+ each trip on groceries and buy only name brand, normal size items but there are no competitors? You have packaging company change the barcode so you don’t have compare prices. I used to get several dollars back each trip now I’m lucky to see a buck. There are a dozen other local grocery stores with these same items and you compare with these stores! We aren’t stupid, I guess we can’t trust you so I’ll be doing my own comparing, especially when they have sales and you never do."

834,e30girl,"July 3, 2018",1,Failing our country After watching a video of how you support Obama and then vilify our president 45 Trump. I have decided I will no longer be using this app. I will not be purchasing any items from Walmart from here on out. I have previous purchases with warranty’s. If I was able to return the items and get the money I spent there back. I would happily do so. How you choose to sell these items is your choice as a corporation. However my choice as a customer is to take my 1200$ shopping trips every 2 weeks to another store.
835,Jedab,"September 26, 2018",3,No more Savings Catcher So now after October 29 you can no longer submit receipts to Savings Catcher. You MUST pay using Walmart Pay and have your receipt automatically checked for savings. If you do not give Walmart your credit card or debit card information to pay using the app your receipt isn’t checked for savings. You cannot pay by cash and get a receipt that is eligible for Savings Catcher. 
836,Michmannermen,"October 31, 2018",1,Disappointed in new savings catcher I have had this app for a long time and always loved using it until they changed the savings catcher and I went from 5 star to 1 star and honestly I would have ranked it no stars if possible. It’s sad that Walmart does not take on consideration the fact that a lot of people still use cash to pay and not cards and the savings catcher is only allowed to be used with Walmart pay. Very disappointed in Walmart and like I said before I’ve always used this app and that’s going to change.
837,ParasiticPostie,"November 4, 2018",1,"Bring back savings catcher without Walmart pay. This app is absolutely worthless without savings catcher being useable on purchases made through any method other than Walmart pay. Until that functionality is restored, I will never use this app again, nor will I encourage anyone to use it, nor will I continue to buy the majority of my purchases at Walmart stores knowing that the convenience of savings catcher makes my driving all over town to shop unnecessary. Your products are inferior and your app worthless."
838,Flick Taylor,"November 8, 2018",3,"Helpful in store Because of the lack of functioning in-store price scanners (hanging signage showing scanner, no functioning scanner underneath) this app is helpful. One frustration in store is when item scans but no price for item. Also, if store database shows no inventory (though I have the item in my hand), no price pulls up. Requires me to find a functioning scanner- a rarity. Fix these issues and the app is an essential shopping tool."
839,ChaosDJ,"November 8, 2018",2,"Update no good I originally gave this app 5 stars. It’s down to 2 since the latest changes. We can no longer scan paper receipts. If you’re going to submit a receipt to savings catcher you have to use Walmart pay at the register. I do not link my debit card to any app, so if I have a zero balance on Walmart pay, it’s a waste of time to open it just to scan. I will no longer encourage others to use this app and may delete it unless this changes."
840,Marinella1623,"September 12, 2017",3,"Where's the shopping list? Before as I'm shopping for my groceries, I was able to scan each item and know the total of what's in my basket before I go to the register. It was very convenient when you don't have enough at least you would know your total so you don't get embarrassed of finding out at the register you went over your budget! Who would want to go through that?"
841,TheGoldenCat,"October 12, 2017",1,"Savings Catcher I am extremely upset with Walmart over the fact that I had an accumulated amount over $43+ in my savings catcher and suddenly I receive an email in Tues 10-10 indicating they have automatically cleared out my account with an emailed EGift Card.  I did not ask to redeem my balance and was given no choice as to how I wanted it redeemed to me.  As of today there has been no email received as per stated. I do not even own a printer nor access to one therefore Walmart, how do you propose those of us “print” these EGift cards?!? This is complete crap."
842,Blastrx,"February 11, 2018",4,"“Lists” don’t work I was eager to try the new list feature that groups items by aisle (based on my selected store) and gives me an estimated total price, but the feature doesn’t work. I type in something like “milk”, but it’s just listed as “milk” and doesn’t suggest brands of milk or size of the container to add to the list. That means it’s not going to give a price for the item."
843,Seahorse Queen,"March 3, 2018",2,"Needs better sorting criteria I’ve used the app about a dozen times over two years. A better sorting feature would help. For example, I looked for sweaters and over 8,000 come up.  I looked for clock radios. Over 5,000 show up and I can sort alphabetically or by price. Sorting by brand would help. Or by extra features such as presence of CD player or battery options. I appreciate being able to order online and then pick up in a store, but better sorting would help."

It would help some if it just went to the main menu when it detects you are in store so I can quickly get to Walmart Pay
848,Sahara29,"January 18, 2020",1,"App arbitrarily returned / canceled my 1st order I placed my first order on Thursday to pick up all four items on Saturday. When I checked my email Saturday morning, I had emails confirming my return. I don’t need an app to make decisions for me.  So far it has taken two additional orders to get the four items I wanted. Plus there will be unnecessary charges & refunds on my checking account. I hate going into Walmart which is why I tried the app & pick up. I will go back to paying more just to avoid Walmart if you can’t do better than this."
849,disapointed grammy,"January 4, 2020",3,"Hate app changes! I use to love this app. Up until they forced you to add your credit card info into app  and use at store. That’s the only way to get savings now! I don’t always use the same credit card. I like to build point into different cards. I loved scanning receipt into app, and watching my saving grow! Not anymore, so I guess I’ll not using this app much anymore. It’s even hard to find online orders."
850,ChrisCox978,"September 24, 2017",1,"Savings catcher Like every single other person who downloaded the Walmart app for savings catcher, I feel scammed, not only do I ""feel"" scammed, I know it... straight up, literally conned. I could go on and explain how they do it and why they invented the savings catcher feature in the first place, but read literally any other review regarding Savings Catcher and you'll understand. Lastly, Walmart doesn't care about their customers, not even a little bit, while we're on the topic, they are even less about their employees. Facts on top of facts. Have a great day."
851,Phyrexian_soup,"March 10, 2018",2,Update broke your wishlist! In one of your updates it broke how the wishlist feature worked. And here is why it’s broke. The customer searches for an item in the app then adds it to the wishlist for purchase later. When later comes around you can’t just go to the wishlist and click on the item to order it you have to go back and search for the item again just to order it. This is why the wishlist feature is broken.
852,kitten2728,"June 13, 2018",5,Kathy I really like the North Olmsted Wal-Mart the employee’s are very nice they almost always say hi if you ask for help you get help.

855,njhgcxddgh,"October 19, 2018",2,"Stupid changes Savings catcher worked beautifully, but now it feels like your customers are getting screwed. Will we no longer be able save up our funds and use them when we CHOOSE, since scanning with Walmart pay automatically deducts what’s in there?? What if our phones don’t work at the time of checking out?? Savings catcher is literally the only reason I still shop at Walmart! HEB is closer to where I live, so maybe it’s time to switch stores."
856,NateMan99,"October 31, 2018",1,"Savings Catcher Ruined to save Walmart Pay Walmart, in a blatant attempt to prop up Walmart Pay, now requires it to use Savings Catcher.  No more scanning. It’s just stupid.  But, I’ve seen it before.  Take a crappy unpopular feature and tie it to something people like.  I’m done with Savings Catcher, Walmart Pay, and Walmart for a while.  It’s not worth the ADDITIONAL hassle over saving 50¢. "
857,Smoore Mom of Four,"December 3, 2018",1,"Miss savings catcher This app used to be great but now that savings catcher has to be linked to your card thru the app it’s become a pain. Not to mention my Walmart account was hacked over the weekend putting a hold on all my money since I had to have a card linked for the savings catcher to work. On another note, the pharmacy part tells me my rxs are ready for pickup when they really aren’t. Pretty worthless app now to me after being hacked. Bring back the receipt uploaded! I can’t trust to keep a card on file after what happened!"
858,DianasLesson,"December 4, 2018",1,Debit Card information comprised I uploaded app and photo of my debit card as instructed for payment on this app and coincidentally was contacted by my bank related to fraudulent activity for the same card information at a Walmart. I had not pursued any other “online” activity or transactions using that debit card in while so my gut told me not to upload this information and yet I did. Thank goodness for my bank contacting me or who knows how much more I would have lost. I can’t prove it but I’ve lost trust in their security controls. Lesson learn/Never again~

862,Belle1222,"October 1, 2018",2,"Developer: please read The only reason I was able to shop through this app was because I had previously scanned my receipts and the app had a history of the products i commonly use.

Which was incorrect - the bag didn’t look like a tote bag OR had the word in the name. Fix ASAP please."

864,strxwberryghost,"November 1, 2018",3,Disappointed I’m kind of disappointed Walmart has decided to take scanning receipts away from savings catcher. Not everyone has a debit card or gift card etc. to pay with. I’m going to do my best to continue using the app but from now on I’d actually have to go into the store and buy what I’d like which causes me time I could be doing something else. Anyway having that ability was fun while it lasted...
865,RLWEEMS81,"November 1, 2018",1,Savings going down the drain Once a happy saver with the savings catcher. The recent switch to Walmart Pay requires a hold up in the line or you have to remind yourself to have your app ready to scan before starting your transaction. This has been an issue the last 3 out of 4 visits to the store. Not being able to scan your receipt after the transaction will continue to cause a loss of savings and that will drive me to other means of saving. Savings Catcher was a hit but why take a working system away?
866,David19964266,"November 3, 2018",4,"Overall OK app but... So funny, the app cannot scan the Walmart MasterCard...you have to manually put in the credit card number."
867,DianeShopaholic,"February 19, 2019",1,Savings Catcher is a joke! I live very close to the local store. I thought the savings catcher was a cool idea. Eventually we were forced to give Walmart our credit card information to use it. They limit you to submitting only 7 receipts a week. If you shop more than that it’s like you are penalized for spending money there. Many times I’ve had to visit 2 Walmart’s in one day because of out of stock items. You would think they wouldn’t limit the receipt submitted if they truly appreciated the extra business!

897,RandlemanGirl,"November 6, 2018",1,"Terrible!! I am not a fan of the new update! If I could give it 0 ⭐️s I would. I pay cash most of the time, and now, if I want to use the savings catcher, I have to us my credit card. And, I can’t save up my cash savings anymore. The new update forces me use that money first and then the rest charges to my credit card. I liked saving up the change I got back for Christmas time or using it on large purchases. Now that I can’t do that, I’m very disappointed!! Will probably delete the app now that it’s useless to me. 😏"
898,$$kgplayer$$,"April 20, 2020",5,"Wonderful App! This app is perfect exactly the way it is.  Even so, about once a month Walmart adds another really useful tool.  There are rarely any problems and if there is a problem, Walmart corrects it immediately, or in some cases compensates by giving money off on your next order.  I love this app!"
899,VipinKK,"August 19, 2019",5,Amazing app One of the main reasons I stopped shopping at Walmart was the horrible customer service. This app has filled that gap. It helps me locate items easily and shopping very convenient. It also helps me store my receipts. Kudos to the team that developed this. I started shopping at Walmart again!!
900,Sharpie#2000,"April 11, 2018",1,Buyer beware I thought I would give Walmart a shot at ordering online.  I ordered some lighting cables and AirPod headphones.  Turned out I had purchased from a 3rd party seller not Walmart.  They don’t tell you this when you order.  A week later I get the cables and the “seller” has not shipped the headphones.  The cables turned out to be fakes.  I called and was told it is was my fault for not noticing that Walmart isn’t the selling party on their own app and the only thing they can do contact the seller on your behalf to request a refund and wait to get a refund.
901,Dfb2011,"June 12, 2018",5,"Amazing This app is amazing! I also love the faster improvements that have been made! This app is a great way to get money back on items you buy that were cheaper somewhere else. Also, easy online ordering!!! - this app is easy on prescription refills or to review prescription history. -☺️D"
902,Cant beat,"June 16, 2018",5,Can’t beat this store Sure I could shop at Macy’s or one of the other Giant but why ..?? They have everything right here and it may not be the top quality clothing but as much as I like to buy clothes who cares and they have the best produce by far and you have the saving catcher which I LOVE ..!! Yup you can’t beat this store ..!!
903,Linda Bartley,"June 18, 2018",5,Walmart review While I like Walmart and shop there some I have started to branch out to other stores who carry the name brands I like. Among my friends this is a big issue. We would rather shop at a store even though prices may be a little higher and have our name brand items.
904,Katherine929,"July 1, 2018",1,"Don’t like the new update I really don’t care for the new update! I used savings catcher for all my receipts. Sometimes they are older then a week, but I still do it because savings catcher keeps track of everything I buy and that’s awesome for me! But I do not like that it doesn’t keep the older ones with the ones that are under the 7days old.  Miss everything being in one spot  in savings catcher and done, hate having to go into purchase history and go looking. Please change it back the way it was."

906,RV and Caribbean Junkies,"September 6, 2018",2,"WAS a really good app I've been a happy user of the WalMart app for a very long time, especially making successful use of the Savings Catcher feature. That is, until the latest update. Since then, everything else about the app seems to work, but when I try to open Savings Catcher, it says unsuccessful and tells me to check my network connection. This occurs either on cellular or WiFi."
907,jrsamuels,"September 27, 2018",2,"Walmart Pay App I recently received an email stating the Walmart catcher is changing, and we will have to start using Walmart Pay. I am NOT happy about that!!!!! This was a great user friendly tool we all were able to use to help save additional funds for Walmart purchases by scanning receipts. Forcing people to use Walmart Pay in order to receive the benefits for Walmart catcher seems excessive. They should have made it an option. No longer my favorite store or app."

909,Kandiroxi,"October 5, 2018",1,Most Annoying of my “Big Store” Apps This is WalMart they should have the best app considering how much money they’re making. But this is one of the worst shopping apps I use. Their website is a lot better than this even. 
910,HisShadowX,"October 13, 2017",5,Wal-Mart Pay is great! I never thought I would say this but Wal-Mart Pay is easy to use and way better then I had thought.

The same price is the same to its a really good app i think u should download it.               If u think this is a bot please don’t think that
912,Hammeridaho,"November 4, 2019",4,"Some good some bad The search algorithm does not always find the product without being very specific, sometimes having to google it first to get SKU to enter through app.  Why does it not have landscape mode for us tablet/iPad users? Mostly like it and have found I like comparing prices via the app before using which ever seller."
913,Cocacola311,"October 13, 2019",3,No more just using gift cards??? Ever since the last update you now don’t have a option to turn off your credit and debit cards and just use gift cards.  You have to use a debit or credit card.  Please bring back the option to turn off credit and debit because I like to load my gift cards into Walmart pay and also link mY associate discount card.
914,FaisalBhuiyan,"October 1, 2019",1,"E Receipt Have been using the app for a while and it was working well but today had a really bad experience in Walmart store with the app, they were not willing to take the e-receipt to return a item that was scanned through the app. I normally use the app to send money and scan all the receipt as I don’t have to save the physical receipt. But they mentioned store policy is different for apps. They r really going backwards with online world rather than moving forward. Thanks for for the really embarrassing situation at the store."
915,lajacobs11,"September 4, 2019",1,"Will no longer be a customer I have been shopping at Walmart since I can remember. I’m so disappointed that your  company is caving to the people that don’t even shop at your stores. Law abiding citizens are fighting hard to keep our 2nd amendment rights. I thought Walmart would be the last place that would fall for this garbage. I am no longer a customer, and most people I know will join me in shopping at other retailers that actually want customers like us. Big mistake Walmart and very bad business decision."
916,katsview,"August 5, 2019",5,"Awesome!!! How nice it is to pull up and have your items delivered to your car.  My person who brought out the groceries, Donna, was very kind and efficient.  All frozen together, all cold together- etc.  she very politely packed everything in my car and away I went!!!  I’ll be back!!!  Thanks Donna you are great.   Waynesville, NC. Katherine"
917,erinlh1318,"August 2, 2019",2,Good bye Savings catcher First - by Oct 2018 you couldn’t scan your receipts into savings catcher. So if you forgot and paid with money or cc you didn’t get to submit your receipt. You could only submit a receipt if you used Walmart pay very frustrating at first but I adjusted and began using that. 
918,Le Renard Savant,"July 8, 2019",3,"Not always accurate Long story short, we found an item at a great price on clearance but it was an in-store purchase only. We arrived at the store, found the exact item, only to be told that they couldn’t honor the price. The clerk said if it we could add it to our cart in the app she could change the price. Well, we couldn’t because the app said it was available in-store only. "
919,kwm1971,"June 12, 2019",3,🤕 avoid the on-app returns & Walmart pay I’ve used this app for couple of years & recently some updates have caused issues. 
920,Carabrink1015,"June 17, 2018",2,"Apparently my store has no inventory?! I used to love this app! The last few updates have killed it. Everything I search for and hit the ‘at my store’ option, it says not available at that store. These are just generic searches, like today looking for a swim suit. I know they have some in stock but according to the app none of any of the nearby stores have any. I don’t know what the problem is but it’s becoming less and less useful. Please fix!"
921,Jcast38,"June 26, 2018",5,Great I gave a 5 star review because I use it a lot I happen to work in one store but I shop mainly at another and I can use the app in both one to help the customer the other to help myself can’t wait till we can use the new version so I don’t have to use the palm reader at work.
922,Daddy😋😍😍😍,"June 30, 2018",5,"Thank you I scan my receipt before I leave the store and it stores it in case I need to return something AND ask me if I want to submit my receipt to Saving Catcher. After 5 purchases I have 5 bucks waiting for me. I don’t clip coupons so this is perfect for me, it does the work and saves"
923,rapunzel2,"July 17, 2018",5,website and the app The website and app is not working because the website says 521 an error occurred while attending to load this content. And the app saying error there was a program signing in. Please try again 
924,Sugabear117,"July 20, 2018",5,"Saving Catcher Kudos to Olivebranch Walmart for always reminding customers to scan their receipts for potential savings purposes not to mention not having to keep up with receipts . Cashier Faye is always extremely friendly , knowledgeable regarding the whereabouts of various items and willing to assist customers ( me) with my inquiries ."
925,Wyl43,"July 28, 2018",5,Great App! The Walmart App will make your shopping at Walmart even more easy and manageable.  It allows you to find items you need and want both online and at your local store. This is a fantastic app!  You can also keep your store receipt in the app. No more paper receipts to keep!  Thank you Walmart.
926,kkasten,"August 26, 2018",1,"Terrible Easy Return Experience - Doesn’t Work Every time I try using the Easy Return I am reminded of why this app is worthless for anything other than purchasing.  Wal-mart wouldn’t release this bug filled app if they were keeping customers from spending money, but when it comes to people making returns and getting refunds... they coincidentally have all the bugs associated with this piece of the app.  Cannot even initiate a return without the numerous failures and “Oops, try again” notifications. Ridiculous!"
927,Hate to be lied to,"September 20, 2018",1,"Too much personal info needed... ....for savings catcher. Walmart has now made it where you have to set up Walmart pay to get your savings which means you have to give them a credit card, debit card, or you have to buy one of their gift cards. You have to use this way (Walmart pay) to even buy anything to get the savings. Not good Walmart. I don’t want to have to use my phone to pay for anything at the store, and I certainly don’t want Walmart “holding onto” my credit card/debit card information."
928,bcvghn,"January 27, 2019",1,Walmart is no longer for lowest price Walmart is no longer the low price leader and this app supports that position of not getting you the best price. 
929,dbrownb,"May 9, 2019",2,"Photo center is junk The photo center portion of the app only shows you a small amount of products. If you are currently looking for cards/invitations on the app, all you can get are save the dates, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, graduation, or generic photo with a block of info. No birthdays, no baptisms, nothing else and no way to search for them on the app. Won’t be using anymore. I’ll find another service that I can find what I’m looking for without needing to go into the store."
930,LuvdnLost75,"October 5, 2017",5,"Great way to save I love being able to scan my receipts and save money at Walmart. The app works great and the only complaint I have is when you open the Savings Catcher to scan a receipt, it takes a long time to load. If not for that, I would have given it 5 stars."
931,MeowMix nomnom,"November 25, 2017",5,Easily search order history I really like being able to search my in store and online order history by keyword. It’s awesome! Thanks. 
932,Christinemsass,"February 12, 2018",1,"Not worth it I got this almost a year ago and I’ve saved less then 5.00 dollars using the savings catcher and I lost half do to it not going to what I picked as an option for it to go towards. Also, they emailed me just now that my receipt was invalid and that of it was less than 7 days old I could contact them. Of course, it’s past the 7days. They also have kept my receipt in the processing phase for over a week before comparing it so I didn’t get a chance. This is one of the worse apps I’ve have ever used."
933,Dgbradl,"February 24, 2018",3,"Shareable shopping list!!! Seriously guys this is a great app but the ONLY reason, and I mean ONLY reason I don’t use this app while shopping in the store is because I can not have a shared list that all of my family can add to in real time. This would be a couple of weeks of dev time at most and be the most impactful thing you could do to drive adoption. Stop making the list pretty and make it useful."
934,Gratefuluser,"April 13, 2018",3,"Please add data export! I downloaded this app so I can keep track of receipts in an easier way. And the app does make it very easy to scan my receipts. Being tax time, I am wanting to break out various personal business expenses. This app could be perfect for that if it allowed for exporting of the data contained within my receipts. I heartily request that feature be added if it all possible. I would make a good app - stellar!"

937,MoneyMods,"May 1, 2020",1,App won’t update pickup orders ! The online grocery order pickup won’t update the order when adding additional items from the cart.  When attempting to “Add Items to the Existing Order” it goes through like its processing it and then says to “please wait a few minutes before making another change to your order “ and never updates to the pickup order!  This is an incredibly frustrating issue that has been happening for days.   Fix this issue!
938,chall21,"April 21, 2020",1,"Super inaccurate I have tried to use the app a few times to see which Wal Mart bear me has a product in store. I thought it would be super helpful since it even shows you which isle at a Wal Mart location something is on. However, every single time I have used it the app has been wrong. Every time that the app tells me a product is at a location and I go to get it they have not had the product I’m looking for. Even though the app says that location has what I’m looking for in stock."
939,fritnickski,"April 9, 2020",4,Time slots The only thing I wish that was on there was more options for time slots. I like going in the morning.

941,Imaimee70,"November 1, 2018",1,Can’t price match if you don’t use Walmart Pay Forcing us to only use Walmart pay to get the price match ? This is ridiculous what about if I don’t have enough money in my bank account? Or if I use cash ? Every time I go to Walmart the experience is worse I feel like returning my entire purchase there is no way for me to speak to a human being about this either also I who knows where the money I’ve saved in the past has gone I’ve only redeemed it once it says I’ve collected $81 dollars I haven’t !!!

I have been using the Walmart app for a while now and I am very disappointed that I can no longer scan my receipts to receive money back on the savings catcher! Please fix this! Other than to look up items that may not have been in the store the savings catcher was the only reason that are used the app! More than likely going to delete the app now as I can just go online to shop instead of using the app!
943,4HollyWood20,"November 14, 2018",1,Deeply disappointed I really liked using the saving catcher part of the app. Now you can only use savings catcher if you use Walmart pay. I pay with a check for my groceries and am not willing to add any of my credit card information to any app. I would have given 5 stars if they would have not done this. It’s stupid. All to try to get you to put your credit card information on their app to pay?  I will now be shopping other places for my groceries etc. you have lost my business!!!
944,try again 3,"January 8, 2019",2,"Savings catcher I’ve gone in to scan a paper receipt only to be told that it won’t accept my paper receipt, makes no sense to me so if you won’t let us scan receipts anymore why should I allow Walmart app to have space on my phone.

Unbelievable, but not surprised."

If this wasn’t the case however then 5 stars."

Twice today I used it and it said my card was declined and I inserted the same card and it was approved and then my Walmart Pay would show the transaction as though the Walmart Pay had worked. Very frustrating and not what I expect from a company with the resources of Walmart to have their convenience features actually work. They are becoming a government agency in their ability to have their web features work.

I found out through another person that had the same thing happen and she said that they have taken certain brand names off their savings list so WALMART IS NOT HONORING Their lowest price guarantee!

It was completely unwarranted and I did not understand- I asked for a manager and the young lady attacked me and started calling me names, this included “racist”. It was appalling! I just stood there in shock. It’s not worth saving money to be abused by their staff. I could only chalk it up to ignorance and lack of education! With all due respect- This place has gone to hell.

The last 3 times I’ve been to this store there were NO operator registers open, only self checkout. Bad enough to stand in the long lines with one or maybe two operating lines but now to stand in line for self service only is ridiculous! If I wanted to ring up my own groceries, I would just have them delivered! This is a terrible disservice to many of our aged."

979,posusbankapp,"November 5, 2018",1,Savings catcher I think I’m going to delete this app now. I only used it for the savings catcher which doesn’t work unless you use the Walmart pay which has NEVER worked at the store. Also cannot enter your receipts any more unless using Walmart pay at store. Sometimes spouse or kids or other people pick up groceries who do not have access to my Walmart app or Walmart pay so buying and using savings catcher is useless. Now I will just watch ads and go to the store with the lowest price and not necessarily Walmart.

I called the store and spoke to the manager and he had me come in to make a report. So I did. The claim went to their insurance and an investigation was conducted. They came back and said it was my fault I slipped.

Simply because I was able to use the savings catcher part. So, I knew I was getting the best prices. But, now you can ONLY submit a receipt if you’re using Walmart pay??? I do not like that! I do not want to put all my cards information into an app. Why can it not be like before?? I liked buying my things how I wanted and then scanning the receipt. I hate this."

I suggested a few things do a better check on your inventory because it’s very inconvenient to a person to be out both the items and the money. If I could give this app a negative 5 stars I would.
987,z3niMAGiNE,"November 7, 2019",1,Recently broken The most worthwhile feature of the app had been the price checking barcode scanner. Lately in store things have been scanning for less and then the price is different (higher) when you get to the register. If you use this feature make sure you’re paying attention while you’re checking out! To make matters worse they won’t honor the app price when you demonstrate the price is listed as lower. This feels like a bait and switch- be careful shoppers!

About a year later they removed some of the categories that savings catcher included . Now this year they have switched savings catcher to Walmart pay only and removing it from some stores under the lie that it is not needed anymore and their prices have gotten better . So they have managed to get rid of price matching while other large stores still do .

Savings Catcher was the best feature but now I will be taking my business to Meijers. At least their app still works for the mass market.

That means any cash or grocery pickup transactions can’t be submitted. Anyone not using Walmart pay, will not be able to submit their receipt.  You’ll be losing many customers, Walmart. There are many people without smartphones with the capability to do this, or people who don’t want to put their credit card info on an app. Shame on you Walmart."

Its upsetting that Savings Catcher is pretty much useless for most customers now, because you can only submit receipts for purchases paid for using WalmartPay. I’m sure most customers don’t use WalmartPay, so this is an easy way for Walmart to get out of refunding customers for higher prices. They took a great app and ruined it because of their greed. Time to delete this app!"
1198,MissNikki72,"January 1, 2019",4,Savings Catcher I hate that you can only submit a receipt to savings catcher via Walmart pay. Not everyone has a debit/ credit card to use. Some people pay with cash. I feel that this keeps some people from getting the same rewards as people with Walmart pay.
1199,ludugan,"January 30, 2019",2,Used to love this app Used to love it but now I’m about to delete it. I don’t understand why they got rid of scanning receipts for savings catcher. I usually pay cash so I can’t use Wal-Mart pay with cash and that is the only way to use savings catcher now. What a waste. I would usually go out of my way to shop at Walmart just for savings catcher now I rarely go. I just go to the grocery store by my house now. Loosing business by doing this Wal-Mart!
1200,Lsfgjfrjf,"June 2, 2018",5,Impressed This app is one million times better than it was when I got it 4 years ago. I am digging the new updates. It works better and fast. It is easy to spend your money on this app easy to add cards easy to shop. Love love love
1201,CRBerry,"June 12, 2018",4,Great App!! Appreciate this app a lot.  I scan as soon as I get in the car so not to forget. It’s good to get back even if small amount.  I would give a five star but I feel when you do grocery pick-up the online receipt should automatically be tied in with savings catcher if you have it.
1202,Josie Le,"June 15, 2018",5,5 Star Retailer Walmart is always striving to bring the freshest produce and the best quality merchandise in the area at low prices. Every store is clean and neat with everything priced. Online services improving everyday making my shopping easier. Thank you very much.
1203,Bamnn97,"June 17, 2018",1,"Customer service lacking. This store never seems to impress me. If i didn’t live so close i would never come here. The staff are totally unfriendly. Don’t say hi. The customer service representative today scanned my receipt 6 times to return a garden hose and kept looking at me like i was making the return up. Needless to say she was in the wrong screen. No apologies at all. Store is always dirty, shelves are a complete mess and unorganized. Overall a disappointment. I don’t know how they can stay in business"
1204,Scott Blank67,"June 21, 2018",1,"Savings Catcher Quit Working after last Update Always enjoyed the savings catcher portion of the app...however, after last update the app will not submit receipts.  I’ve even tried typing in the receipt info, and all I get is a pop-up that’s says “Oops! Something went wrong”, regardless of whether I type in receipt info or scan the receipt.  So for past few days, I can’t enter any receipts...and don’t forget they limit receipts eligible for savings to the last 7-days."

1208,DanOstergren,"July 12, 2018",1,"Used to be acceptable The app used to be ok, but has gotten progressively worse with each recent update, which the most recent one being unable to scan my receipts 90% of the time. This makes the app pointless to me, as savings catcher is the only reason I use the app and often choose to shop at Walmart. Without this feature working i no longer see why many people should be shopping here if we can no longer get the best deals."
1209,Theangrywhomp,"July 25, 2018",2,"Confused I was enjoying shopping online then picking my order up , but now with the change, I have no idea how to order with the new method.  It’s hard for senior citizens to keep changing and learning new ways of doing things.  I absolutely hate shopping in-store method and waiting in long lines at the checkout because only a few registers are open, even on weekends and before holidays when it’s the busiest."
1210,rrsmith2003,"November 15, 2017",4,"Savings Catcher and Receipts I mainly use the app for Savings Catcher and to store my receipts. It would be helpful to be able to scan an item your returning and have the app pull up a receipt. I had several items to return on separate receipts, and it took a while to find each one. Otherwise, it's great."
1211,FahrenheitGirl,"November 22, 2017",3,Savings catcher problems No longer lets you put on a gift card. Always says there is an error like we are now going to be forced to redeem to Walmart pay. I don’t have a problem with Walmart pay as long as I am still able to get a paper receipt. Until that time I refuse to use it so I now can not access my savings catcher money.
1212,Digimerge,"December 12, 2017",1,"Fire them all. The developer team who decided to change how to view and order pharmacy in this app needs to be fired, along with everyone in the chain above them for approving it. I was able to view all my medication and order easily using verification I set up in the app. Now, I must go through a verification process for each medication, answering credit application like questions about a relative and where they live. Why do they need that information!?!"
1213,DPB425,"February 13, 2018",5,"Awesome App!! I give it 4 stars for the price scan feature alone. Things on the shelf are never where they are supposed to be and the price scan app is simply awesome. I searched for an item and it told me what aisle to find it on, that is pretty cool too. I shop at Walmart a lot. Great app!!!"
1214,snrphnx,"February 18, 2018",2,"Lasted build is terrible. Lists disappear more often than Houdini’s rabbits! Also lost ability to scan items while in list mode, where you might, oh, I don’t know, want to add to a list??!! I appreciate the efforts made to make this app more functional while in store, but it’s ease-of-use factor has decreased substantially. Please fix, and add more “scan & go” stores. Thanks for the effort, however misguided it turned out."
1215,Serverman5,"March 1, 2018",1,Horrible app!! Didn’t even get a chance to see how sucky the app was! I read a bunch of review that stated the app sucked but I couldn’t even get it to log in! Just kept telling me that my password was wrong even though when I typed it into the browser it worked. Also wouldn’t let me change the password or reset it. Nor would it let me change to another account! I only wanted the app for the savings catcher but it’s not even worth it. Do better Walmart!

1219,BriP81,"July 14, 2019",1,Complete Oder never filled I ordered two rocking chairs for pickup. I received an email confirmation. I had a friend go to pick them up for me because they wouldn’t fit into my car. When he got there they only had one chair and had cancelled the other chair without me knowing. They text me that the order was ready for pickup. It wasn’t complete. No thanks Walmart I do not want to pay full price for your display chair. Thanks for giving me another reason NOT to shop with you.
1220,Trin-1,"September 13, 2018",3,No more Savings catcher will now be through their Walmart pay...starting in Oct...my app doesn’t work in the store because internet is real spotty inside the store. Inventory counts are usually off. Back to shopping ads with the savings catcher change. I think they will eventually do away with it. I will use the app for online shopping still.
1221,Dancelikeafreak,"September 25, 2018",2,Savings catcher loved it until they stopped processing my receipts for savings catcher. It says “In process” but we are going on ten days now. Good luck figuring out how to contact them in the app.
1222,Phoenician-xyzzy,"October 1, 2018",4,Siri Integration Recent updates to the app state that Siri will tell us how busy the store is and it will open Walmart Pay but Siri doesn’t appear to recognize any commands related to this app. A tutorial would be nice when rolling out new features because right now using any them is all a big mystery.
1223,Nikolasphill,"October 30, 2018",4,Great... But.. Would've given 5 stars. But the savings catcher now only works with Walmart pay. Which I use when I go in. But I use Walmart grocery because of back problems. So now I can’t use savings catcher at all. Disappointed they have no plans on having it cross over for the grocery app.
1224,Obe_97,"October 30, 2018",1,"No more savings catcher The whole reason I downloaded the app was for the savings catcher, it was so convenient checking out then scanning my receipt for the catcher. I was forced to update to use the savings catcher, and now it’s mandatory to use Walmart pay anytime you checkout to use the savings catcher. There should still be an option to scan receipts. I dislike paying transactions with my phone & will probably never use this app again because of this."
1225,Cancan24,"November 10, 2018",1,Unhappy I hate this new update with saving catcher.. my husband and I usually do not go to Walmart together so now I can’t get the savings from his purchases... it really makes me mad.. I usually scan receipts all year then come Christmas time I use that to help with buying presents... y’all should seriously rethink this because Walmart will lose a lot of business over this.. savings catcher was really awesome and y’all had to go a mess that up... I really wish y’all would bring it back..
1226,Brenis,"November 21, 2018",1,Savings Catcher The app is NOT working properly. I’m not able to submit my receipts. I see a message that you have to use Walmart pay to add the receipts but is not working at all has been one month and Walmart don’t do anything to fix the problem. It’s very frustrating trying to get someone to help you. This is the worse customer service that I have ever received from a store. Communication is horrible and the lack of service is completely unacceptable.
1227,Devogirl,"December 9, 2018",1,Don’t buy anything from a 3rd party Through Walmart because if you try to return it in store you have to have a box and if they can’t print the label for you they will send you away and put your order through as you returned it at the store when you didn’t. And when you call customer support for help to reverse it they tell you you have to go back to the store. Big waste of time. Just buy at Walmart in the store or don’t buy at all
1228,uLove.Candy,"January 4, 2019",1,No to bill pay I thought by downloading the app I would be able to pay my bill without going in the store. 
1229,fdgygguujk,"March 10, 2019",5,Savings catcher I used to like scanning my receipts and using the gift card. But now you have to use your phone to pay which isn’t something I want to put my credit card info on. So know I do not get any matching. Sad day for me and Walmart.

1234,angsantini,"July 11, 2018",5,Love savings catcher Love this app in general for online shopping but the savings catcher/receipt scanner is amazing.

1241,Froggie79,"March 23, 2018",2,Eh My biggest gripe is the search results. Whenever I search for something specific it’ll return a massive number of results and only 3-4 actually match my search. The search engine will return results that may match only 1 word if your search term. If I’m searching for a specific thing I want results that only match that thing. Not items that are completely unrelated because 1 word matches.
1242,mEDo.02,"April 6, 2018",2,Improve Walmart Pay The app is too slow home page must be simple so when someone uses Walmart Pay doesn’t spend time at the cashier waiting for the app to load. I have iPhone 8 Is not a real issue with me but I used to use the app with iPhone 6 it was a real bad experience I had to open the app 2 min or more to let the app load and use Walmart Pay. U should make Walmart pay as fast as Apple Pay.
1243,daisygirlmayzie,"April 15, 2018",1,"Impossible to access pharmacy I’m SO disappointed in this app! My pharmacy recommended using the app because I never know if I have prescriptions on hold.

I’ve changed my password, I’ve deleted the app and re-downloaded it, and I made sure my phone is up to date. The error message keeps popping up. 😡"
1244,seeeeebbbbbb,"May 30, 2018",2,Savings catcher. A friend of mine introduced me to this app. She told me if I shop at Walmart I have to try the savings catcher (Walmart no longer guarantees best price so this is their way to make up for it apparently.). It is one of the worst “catchers” I’ve ever seen. I travel a lot and notice the prices vary tremendously everywhere. The app just throws chump change around every so often. Wish it worked though. Might have to switch to aldi’s here soon.
1245,Dawn Neely,"June 5, 2018",2,"Online I love the store, but out of the 3 items I’ve ordered online, I’ve not received any of them. 2 items I ordered as Christmas gifts only to be told 1 week before Christmas that they didn’t have it anymore. The other item was my daughter’s graduation invitations that were to take 5-7 days, but almost 4 weeks later are still not in, not have I received an e-mail response regarding the order."
1246,Tess514514,"June 8, 2018",1,A gimmick I have found savings catcher to be a bit of a joke. It’s more a tool that allows Walmart to track your buying behavior and advertise to you that they always have “the lowest prices” than it is to actually save you money. I believe the way the system is set up minimizes any potential payouts. I used to get some money back when I would submit receipts. Now it is rarely. I much prefer the Ibotta app that actually does pay out and reward you for purchases.
1247,Kiki87878787,"June 12, 2018",3,"Got hacked before I LOVE the savings catcher program! The first year I used it I had about $40 in my account to spend at Christmas.

It’s a lot of work to build up all that cash just to get taken."

1249,Dissappointed in Mississippi,"June 14, 2018",3,Disappointed App results constantly says that either the items I bought at Walmart are either unavailable or can’t be found.  I got several dollars the first couple of months I used it but haven’t received 1 cent in the last 6-8 months.  I guess there’s an unwritten limit to the amount of reward money.  Very disappointed!
1250,Rushidyl,"November 15, 2018",1,"RIP Savings Catcher Unbelievable. Walmart has screwed savings catcher for the last time. First, they did away with the email barcode to pay with your money earned back. Second, they forced us to pay with Walmart pay in order to use the funds earned back. Now, the entire tool it was good for was eliminated: scanning Walmart receipts into Savings Catcher to earn the difference in prices—since, of course, the prices are “always” low. Absolutely disappointed with this."
1251,BoPeep7796,"November 16, 2018",1,Horrible making people use Walmart Pay to save! I’ve used savings catcher for a long time and made sure to shop exclusively at Walmart to save money and time using savings catcher. Now we are forced to keep credit card on file and use Walmart Pay to submit receipts and can no longer submit with the paper receipt. What a huge disappointing downfall for Walmart. Back to Kroger and Meijer to shop. At least all I need at those stores is a savings card.
1252,twin for life,"February 10, 2019",4,"Price checker My favorite thing about the app is the in store price checker. Just pull out your phone, scan the barcode and you have the price.

1267,Seneca18!,"October 30, 2018",1,"Used to like it I thought the idea behind saving catcher was fantastic. Maybe it was designed to get you in the door and then make you switch to Walmart pay in order to keep using it. Not me, I actually regularly shop Target but once a friend showed me saving catcher I began going there again for misc stuff and did get some money back, so I began going more and more.

App only shows partial return but the store computer shows full return. No actual credit to my bank and app & store are not aligned in what happened. No help at the store other than call cash office and give it time to correct 😡
1282,Killakim88,"October 29, 2018",1,"Hate new policy I hate the new Walmart pay only update. I have been using the app for three years. I loved it but now you reward people who have been using the app by forcing them to use Walmart pay. I do agree I liked the convenience it gives of submitting Walmart pay ereceipts without scanning, but to force people to use it is not user friendly. This will not make use Walmart pay more, in fact it will most likely force not to use the app altogether."
1283,frustrated w this!!,"November 4, 2018",1,Have to store credit card info I am very disappointed in the new update. Now you have to store your credit card information in the app and use Walmart Pay just so you can use savings catcher. I will not put in my credit card information so now I can’t use it. With all the data breaches and credit card hacking that has happened over the years it is a bad move on Walmarts part to change it the way they did. 😡🤬

I have to wait 2-3 business days to get a refund. Like this is just the dumbest thing Walmart can do. No instead of getting it today I have to wait a week. Again DO NOT DOWNLOAD. It feels I wasted 300 dollars for nothing. Like the refund doubt will come in less than a week.
1289,CrazyTexan1,"October 21, 2019",1,Alright It’s an alright app to use in store considering there is 1 price checker every 2 miles of the stores. Otherwise it’s pointless to have. Most of the items listed on the app say check in store for price! What is the point of having a mobile app to purchase if the majority of items say check in store for price?

1300,Whyway,"April 8, 2018",3,Glitchy I ordered stuff for pickup today because it was on the shelf and it still sent it from the warehouse. So instead of “picking up today” I’m not getting it for four days because there’s no shipping on the weekends. It should’ve been picked up same day because it was on the shelf. It’s a pretty big glitch if it’s something time sensitive.

Lucky to filter search results down to a few thousand items as most filters are inappropriate for search. Amazon’s got no competition here.

It makes me never want to shop using your app ever again.

When I asked why they’re no bags, I was told they had high volume to come through. I was in there during Christmas and they had bags. I believe this is a case of skimpy ordering by the manager for bonus purposes. It’s a shame that Walmart makes as much money as it does and their are no bags for the items! I was asked if I wanted to buy the reusable bags though 😡"

1446,midoriTX,"July 3, 2018",1,"Savings Catcher What is the point in shopping at Walmart, submitting savings catcher receipts, getting money back (into your savings catcher account) then having it all disappear?? Very disappointed that my $35+ is now a zero balance. No, I didn’t use the money toward one of my Walmart purchases. $35 may not be much to Walmart, but for a single mom it’s a lot, especially when it’s time to buy school supplies. Had you not wiped out my account I would have given 5 stars."

If they don’t fix this I’ll be going elsewhere."

I use to use this app to order stuff to pick up on my break or lunch; however, when I filter out the 3rd party sellers, it filters out the Walmart sold stuff. So now when a customer is trying to find something, I can’t pull out my phone and use the Walmart app to find it. I really appreciate how much you want to sell the 3rd party stuff, especially since Walmart isn’t responsible for the 3rd party items."

But since you have decided to cancel the Savings Catcher program, and instead ask people to sign up for Walmart Pay, I will be deleing your app at the end of the month. There are other apps out there that help save me money without asking me to use their app to actually pay for my items. I will not store my credit card info in your app. Good riddance!"

1463,PinkCupcake007,"November 11, 2018",1,Forced to use Walmart Pay for savings catcher The only reason I used this app was for the savings catcher. They have now updated the app so the only way you can use the savings catcher feature is at the register by using Walmart pay and no longer by scanning your receipt. I don’t like the fact that I have no choice but to use Walmart Pay in order to use the savings catcher. Another reason to avoid shopping at Walmart I guess.
1464,$$$ El boxer $$$,"November 11, 2018",1,Disappointed I am really disappointed at the savings catcher now you have to use walmart pay to submit the receipt and you get an e receipt and not an actual receipt i am no longer shopping at walmart because this is way to save money submitting to compare prices and have an actual receipt for my other apps like ibotta saving star checkout 51 this was an easier way to save now its all messed up losing clients this way
1465,Jessica9168,"November 21, 2018",1,"Jessica 😐 I really have not been so useful because with the desire to go to the supermarket to bring the things I went to buy and remind me when I pay to scan, it is not convenient for me to forget it many times, they must find a way to register when the person forgot to do it, they must leave the old system so I would have more opportunities to save and accumulate balances for my next purchase."
1466,CarNana,"November 23, 2018",1,Up set You can no longer scan Your recipe. This is not good. It was one of the few things going for WalMart. They don’t sales. Have cut the merchandise in half. I can’t find half of products they use to carry. All the other grocery stores run ads every week. Give you points to get 10. A gallon off. WalMart now has taken the one savings away. And you have lost this customer for good. Brookshire’s and Kroger has won me over.

Besides that, this is a very neat app that I would recommend to anyone."
1470,TampaCarla,"June 21, 2018",2,Used to be great. Not anymore The overhaul on this app wasn’t tested properly before was deployed. There are several pages you can’t get to any more such as your order history and your lists. I’m so sick of getting their Oops page that I may stop using this app altogether.  I don’t understand why they took something that was functioning properly and turned it into a piece of crap.

BUT Walmart should come back with the price match that was a good thing to ya they may have lost a little BUT a lot of ppl shop at Walmart I think ppl would shop more if the price match came back . Thank you Sandy
1472,Ffghjjkkvfddvn,"June 24, 2018",5,App works well I use the app often when in the stores shopping. It is so easy to scan items to get the price if needed. Returns are easy if you have scanned your receipts too.

1479,Rolltide2,"October 5, 2018",1,"Not a fan While I love the Walmart pay option and the electronic receipts, showing on the app is such a pain unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. The filters don’t work. For instance I tried to shop in shoes and filtered for women’s shoes and I still got shoes for men and toddlers. Plus there was no way to look for just sandals. I can’t scroll through over 100k pairs of shoes. Guess I’ll shop online elsewhere unless I know exactly what I’m looking for."
1480,Xurai,"March 17, 2018",2,Not worth it Walmart and this app are crap... I got it for the savings catcher but it’s a huge gimmick... we have two Walmart’s in our town and at one Walmart we got milk for $3 and the other Walmart had it for 97 cents and they wouldn’t honor it and match the price... they kept giving us excuses even though it says on their apps and websites and such that they have to match the price if we have proof and we had it..

To be a large corporation, sad to see it declining so since Mr Sam had the control. I remember when Walmart came to our area several years ago. Huge decline - it doesn’t feel as customer oriented anymore."
1485,walmart used to be good,"June 7, 2018",1,Savings catcher Savings catcher is not worth a flip. I have been scanning my receipts and I know the item is on sale at the local grocery store. Walmart comes back and says no lower prices were found.  I called Walmart about it and they said oh yes we see where it’s on sale and we will put your money on your savings catcher.  They never did. If you are not going to do what you say just stop everything altogether. Your word is not worth anything.

In theory it's awesome but not so much in my reality.

1621,️Blan,"June 18, 2018",5,Makes a difference This app has made it possible for me to buy an emergency formula for my son or otger itwms I need a few extra dollars to afford. It’s a backup that is a bonus when times are tough. App works great. :)

Please put cashiers back to work."
1625,Jpop90,"July 2, 2018",1,Awful since the update I have used this app for the past few years and it’s been GREAT. The most recent update has ruined the app for me. It won’t let me scan my receipts anymore and when I try to type in the info it says there’s an error and to try again. No matter how many times I try it still will not work. What’s the point in using it if the savings catcher doesn’t work? Very frustrated.
1626,savingsnow,"July 16, 2018",2,"Needs work!! I have, up until recently enjoyed this app. I specifically use it for savings catcher purposes.

1629,BBeth73,"November 4, 2018",1,Heck no Walmart Recent changes have mandated that users can no longer scan their receipts using savings catcher. RATHER they insist you put in your credit/banking information!! NO THANKS!! I would RATHER NOT RISK MY INFO BEING HACKED!!

I cannot use it in store because all I can see is the last 4 digits of my gift cards. Better to save the gift cards to a separate app than this one. Please update.

Well i use to love the savings catcher, but as of recently it won’t even process my receipts and when they do finally get processed sometimes weeks do months later I get zero back!!!

It’s such a shame it used to be so easy and convenient and now it’s just a huge headache all around!"

1642,B&B29,"December 16, 2018",1,Savings catcher I absolutely hate how you have to do the savings catcher to scan your receipts.  I have tried for weeks since it changed to figure it out and I still have not gotten a decent answer from the staff on what to do to turn in your receipts.  The savings catcher needs to be switched back to how it used to be.  This is just another thing that is making me dislike Walmart less and less.
1643,AndrewMoss,"December 22, 2018",1,"Savings Catch on Walmart Pay Doesn’t Work! I don’t know if no one else is paying attention, but if you look at recently submitted receipts for Savings Catcher the last one is probably around October.  I have been using Walmart Pay for a while, so that was no huge deal for me, but there is no submit receipt button immediate after the transaction or searching Walmart Pay history.  Savings Catcher is BROKEN!"
1644,Sheru4uall,"February 12, 2019",4,Very handy for prices and returns I use it to know prices for items that don’t have a price tag in store and it’s very handy. It is easy to start a return of your items that you purchased both online and in store

I’ve been to the pharmacy dept several times for help to set up between my husband’s iPhone & mine so we can pick up either’s script. Still can’t get it to work and no phone # to call for help. Originally told it only works for one family member which doesn’t make sense for users because what if the other spouse is out and about and can save you  the trip.
1646,memethe3rd,"April 5, 2019",2,Savings catcher update I used to love the savings catcher because all I had to do was just submit my receipt and that was all. Now I need to add Walmart Pay just to submit any receipt which I hate because I prefer only to use cash. This should not have been changed. I give it a two star only because I still have the app but it’s not of use to me anymore. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!
1647,James Dearman,"September 4, 2019",1,"Walmart CEO is a COWARD!

Thanks to the idiots who scare so easily, they ask for everyone’s liberties and protections to be taken away! What a disgrace!"

It is actually worse. No person to greet you (you have to check in on a computer) you name displays on a queue, but there is no one in the back room to handle the pick-up.

1655,seanmarci,"September 1, 2018",1,"A big sham Since they stopped doing ad matching, I have lost all credit in Walmart. They claim their app will check local ads and match it up for you. Yet, week after week it fails to do so and I have to go in and prove dozens of items were cheaper at their competitors. They are just using the ad match cancellation and the app to increase profits and fool people into thinking that they are saving money and time with the app."

Unable to scan in when I arrived and receiving good customer service does no good."

So basically if your store machine isn’t working right or I forgot my phone in the car then I’m not worthy of savings. Thx for crapping on the hard working people who choose to spend their money at your store. Shame on you.

Please change it back. Thanks

1942,Pikabell,"February 7, 2019",1,Saving catcher change 👎 I hate the saving catcher change. I feel like it was changed because it's easy to forget to pull out your phone while you pay and it's difficult to use. If you don't do it right there and then at the register. No savings. 
1943,KJ 2008,"February 17, 2019",2,Wish it could be better The app would be better if Savings Catcher was brought back how it originally was. Not everyone uses debit/credit cards.

1992,disopentedM,"November 14, 2018",1,Savings catcher 😭 I use to love this app mainly the savings catcher part of it. But now with the new update I can’t stand it. I went to buy some stuff and through the new scanning method and to my surprise it charge straight to my card without consent. I don’t like how my choice was taken away. Can we just go back to the old way and scan receipts?! I will not be shopping at Walmart very much anymore.
1993,Oldtreker,"December 29, 2018",5,Good app This app is getting better all the time. Walmart has installed large row  number signs making it much easier to find stuff in the store.

After getting used to scanning receipts with the previous division this has not been a pleasant experience to keep up with it all in the checkout line. And we all know about the Walmart checkout lines!!
1996,guncolca,"March 1, 2019",2,"S. Guida I agree that Savings Catcher is much more complicated. Half the time my phone doesn’t hook up right with scanner. I won’t take the time holding other customers up to mess with it. And yes, the cashiers are not able to help. I used SC for many years. Big reason I shop Walmart. I may stop with SC issues being a big part of that decision."

You are going from being a power house store to a soon to be out of business company.  Good job!!!!!"

2085,Heathergoo1,"November 2, 2018",1,Savings catcher I’ve used savings catcher for a long time. I loved it cause it was easy to use and a good way for me to save some money. Also it was a great way to keep a record of my receipts. But with the new update you can only use savings catcher if you use Walmart pay at checkout. I mostly pay with cash. This new update is terrible. Change savings catcher back to the way it was. 🤬
2086,JDRamos04,"November 26, 2018",2,Chase Pay I cannot seem to figure out. I have been looking online for an answer and cannot find how to link Chase Pay to Walmart Pay. I know I cannot use Chase Pay in store without it being linked to Walmart Pay and that is all I am trying to do but cannot seem to figure it out.

2088,c@!,"January 20, 2019",1,Receipts no loading I have not been able to even load my receipts for 2 months. Couldn’t load any of my Christmas ones. Will the upgrade fix this. Also is there anyway to get my points since the system was messed up. Funny how it messed up during the biggest shopping months and better deals could have been detected.
2089,Drew3729,"January 20, 2019",3,Walmart Pay not working anymore App is okay. Kinda sluggish. Biggest issue is Walmart pay scanning won’t register at checkout anymore. Walmart employees were less then keen on helping and had no idea what the issue is. Hopefully the next update will fix the issue.

I’m not going to waste my time driving out to a Walmart that MIGHt have what I need when I can be guaranteed before I leave my house hat Target or someone has it. Especially when half the employees are incompetent lazy workers and won’t go check the back.
2097,Dolphinfantasies,"July 1, 2018",2,"Pharmacy part needs work I mostly use this app to refill my prescriptions quickly, they changed how you enter you birthday and it’s a pain to use now.

2098,resellar,"July 2, 2018",3,Good not great I like that it tells you where the items are located in your local store. The biggest problem is the search results are too extensive. You get way too many unrelated items for your keyword search. Needs more refining.

2103,bja22,"February 3, 2018",1,In store use I have used savings catcher for years. I think it is a good program. But I am really upset that you have to sign up for Walmart pay to be able to use it in the store. I think it is ridiculous way to force people to sign up for your service when we don’t want to. I don’t want Walmart linked to my checking account. I may have to reconsider using Walmart.

2105,Tauslove,"June 2, 2018",1,"Very disappointed I’m very disappointed that you can only scan 7 receipts per week, I shop Walmart every day sometimes twice daily, and then you have seven days to scan your receipts in order to get the savings, if not you lose, well Walmart you have made my receipts pass the 7 Day period already so what is really going on. Is this a scam Walmart, I’m just saying what I see. 🤦🏽‍♀️"

2107,BaltFlowerLady,"June 2, 2018",5,Great App Love this app. I go to Walmart for good prices and the app gives me a bonus. I get money back on 9 out of 10 receipts. Sometimes it’s .50 but sometimes it’s $3-$4. It adds up quickly.

Which is weird because sister bought 2 in one of the stores. But I wanted to see which store had my size. Oh not very useful. Not only item I have tried looking up. Have tried in the past. And no not all Walmart’s carry same thing.

That was the whole reason I downloaded the app,  I don’t need to search for things in the store via an app.  I don’t need to reorder something.  All the functionality left in the app is useless.  I guess it was good while it lasted. I’ll now be deleting the app."

2114,ARB317,"February 8, 2020",1,"App is a joke. Making a list and looking for items takes hours. Too frustrating to use. You scroll down looking at items and it’ll freeze and take you back to the beginning. Never fails so I quit trying. Also, wrong reviews on items. Saying things are in stock and they aren’t. Saying they aren’t but they are. Yeah, it’s crazy."

Be sure to be extremely careful when using this app."

When you look it up on the app even filtered I get stuff for Avengers or other characters. Which is defeating the purpose."

I don’t care to link my debit card to an app for security purposes. The only perk for using this app was for savings catcher. I guess I will have to catch my own savings.

2150,Verhoffs,"December 23, 2017",1,Too slow I like the features of the app but with the savings catcher it is way too slow. Takes for ever to load.

I used the money I saved to buy items I might not have been able to afford. Now it’s only offered if I use Walmart Pay. Hey Walmart, if I wanted to use Walmart Pay, I would have started using it a long time ago. Don’t twist my arm into using it. I’m deleting the app. Guess I’ll see what Target has to offers."
2184,random me women,"November 9, 2018",1,Savings catcher The new way the app is you have to pay with the app in order to submit receipts. It’s ridiculous. I LOVED Walmart & the app cause of being able to scan my boyfriends & my receipts. Now we can’t do that. Deleting till fixed / back to old way! RIDICULOUS WALMART. With as much money as you make the old savings catcher shouldn’t be an issue! Would rate negative if I could!

2290,Noname,"November 4, 2018",2,Savings catcher Savings catcher?  Really more like payment control. You have to scan using the pay app. WTH!!!  We all don’t carry or have phones with us at Wally-world. If you’re going to start building a data base with my purchases plus the face scanning you’ve started doing at the registers I’m done with Wally-world.
2291,momofbeaut3,"November 8, 2018",1,Savings catcher Very inconvenient to have to link a card and use Walmart pay in order to use savings catcher now! It was awesome to just scan the receipt after a purchase to submit it! Especially when ALL cards aren’t acceptable and A LOT of people to this day still use cash rather than everything being electronic!! Very disappointed!!

No reason to shop at Walmart anymore!
2295,lls 92,"November 28, 2018",1,Doesn’t work Hasn’t worked right and compared prices in over 2 months. App is crappy and a waste of time.

2298,mav-,"January 22, 2019",1,Not as good Not as good as when the client scan their receipts with his celular phone. I lost the opportunity of various saving catcher because the cashier or I as client are not able to enter the receipts data at the end of the purchases. The cashiers said “it doesn’t scan your receipt and I don’t know why. There is nothing that I can do”.  Then I lost the “lower price” advantage. An  unfulfilled promises.

2490,jennygirl05,"November 7, 2018",1,Change it back I liked using this app and submitting my receipts to the savings catcher. I’m disappointed in that I have to use the Walmart app/pay in order to submit a receipt. I do not always like to use the app to pay while in the store and takes away from any cash purchases I might make. I think any receipt should be eligible.

You are upset that no one uses your crappy Walmart pay so you make those who want to use savings catcher use it?? How about you just support the standardized Apple Pay and google wallet like everyone else? No one wants to(or should) store there credit card information with a merchant.

I only use Walmart pay when I have enough money saved up in my account. I'm a cash only type person so this doesn't work for me at all. They need to switch it back!
2603,iOSproblems,"November 3, 2018",1,Chase pay not supported on iOS in Walmart pay On the website says chase pay is accepted just choose it as your payment option.  But chase pay isn’t an option on iOS devices. This is a big problem and is the only reason I wanted Walmart pay.  This needs fixed.

I don’t like that I have to set up payment with my personal credit card information in Walmart pay in order to save.  And the last 2 receipts I have go without any savings bc I did not know about the change. I will now shop first at Aldi.
2605,MadNaNa$$$,"November 20, 2018",1,New changes big fail I used to love this app. Now if you don’t pay with Wal-Mart Pay you aren’t allowed to use the savings app. When did cash become a bad thing?

3621,NLG1,"February 8, 2019",1,Walmart pay does not work every time Two days in a row my card attached to Walmart Pay was declined. No reason given. Same card was used at Walmart using the chip at register-everything went through fine. Very frustrating

3624,Shannibal Lecter,"March 9, 2019",1,They ruined savings catcher Only reason I used this app for was savings catcher. And now they won’t let you use it without tying a card to the account for Walmart pay. Not interested in giving over card info when this stuff is so easily breached.
3625,Dontcaeriel,"April 1, 2019",5,Great So easy and make shopping so much easier! Thank you Walmart app
3626,jack201767,"May 6, 2019",2,Bugs? The app won’t let we do the Walmart pay it lets me click literally every other option except the Walmart pay button really annoying.
3627,Brocksley5,"May 15, 2019",1,"No point to the app without savings catcher Why would I ever use Walmart Pay without savings catcher? Walmart pay is more work than paying with a card or cash, but you would get money back through savings catcher. Now that’s gone, so the app is too. Deleted."
3628,CrAzY_77,"July 11, 2019",1,No savings catcher! Well this was a bait and switch app.  They promise you savings only to take it away in a short period of time. I don’t understand why this garbage of an app is getting 4.5 stars? Are people that feebleminded that they can’t see they are baited? This app really doesn’t deserve one star. 🤦🏻‍♂️

It declines my payment method every time forcing me to swipe the exact same card that I have loaded and it goes through. It has the funds. But I forced  to do it this way just to get my savings catcher submitted. Go back to the old way please!

3633,misspeachesllama,"November 29, 2018",1,Deleted it Receipts were not scanning so I updated the app. Of course the new design is ugly and visually offensive. And then it said I had to set up the wallet with my debit or credit card to keep doing the savings catcher.  Nope. Deleted the app.  I refuse to be forced to reveal my personal financial information. True rating is zero stars.

3760,Rad9119,"April 7, 2019",1,No more savings catcher It’s literally the only reason I use the app. And 9 purchases out of 10 I get money back. Thanks for making all of the savings catcher users angry. I only use Walmart pay because of savings catcher. Might as well delete the app after that.
3761,LeahLee881906,"April 28, 2020",1,Maybe hack Getting the run around contact should be available in app chat and number to call. Now my refund is being sent to a card that is not even mines how could that happen? I change all my accounts info.
3762,Option75,"April 8, 2020",1,Horrible update. The start screen to choose is horrible. Just let us in to the app. Logging in at a store always takes forever and now I don’t want to use wal mart pay because the app is cumbersome to get to the pay screen.

3773,teachcar,"October 28, 2018",1,Doesn’t work anymore I have submitted receipts and they never finish comparing prices to reward me lower price.  I am still waiting for price comparisons on receipts from about a month ago.  Easier to just go to those stores and buy it at the cheaper price.
3774,Mommas2001,"October 30, 2018",1,Savings Catcher Was an amazing app for the savings catcher until now. As of 10-29 you can no longer scan your receipts and can only do it via their mobile pay for the savings catcher. I pay 99% of the time with cash. Won’t be using their app no more.
3775,Stargilly,"November 1, 2018",1,Horrible Walmart savings catcher would not load while standing in line but it works fine at home. The employees at Walmart don’t have a clue about this app. Now I have missed out on loading my savings catcher receipts all together because you can scan paper receipts
3776,Done with Wal-Mart,"November 1, 2018",1,"Wth! Done with this app! I loved that I was able to scan receipts and honestly it kept me going back to Wal-Mart. Now that it’s gone, I don’t really care, I’ve always liked Price Choppers produce better anyway. "
3777,Djhall61,"November 5, 2018",1,Scan receipts You can only scan receipts at the register?  That is terrible. Plus it takes the credit you have so you can’t let it build up? Another thing that I don’t like. I gave it 1 star only because I had to to write this review.
3778,xXSCAR117Xx,"December 12, 2018",2,Protection Plans Not Added Every time I’ve tried to add a protection plan it says time is needed to find the receipt. It’s been weeks since I added three of mine and they don’t show up. This is frustrating.

4758,BooBoo98765,"June 24, 2018",4,"Savings Catcher & Walmart Pay Before Walmart created the Savings Catcher feature on their website, I would shop at numerous stores just to save a buck or two. Now I’m able to do all my shopping at one place - Walmart & only Walmart. I’m able to do so because if the item I purchased happens to be on sale elsewhere, Walmart will reimburse me the difference on an e-gift card. It allows you to pay with your cellphone, at checkout, via Walmart Pay. Even though it’s not given back to me in actual cash, I have no problems spending money on a gift card. I’m now able to utilize all the local sales ads at one location, cut my shopping day in half, as well as pocket my gas money I would’ve used traveling from store to store. Even though so far I’ve been mostly pleased with the Savings Catcher feature, there are a few negative points I’d like to mention. One major problem is the majority of the Walmart employees have no idea how it works. I find myself educating most of the cashiers at the checkout counter. I’m not sure if this has been fixed or not but the last time I tried getting gas and attempted to pay via my e-gift card (Walmart Pay), it would not allow me to do so. The only way I could use my funds for gas was to transfer funds from my Walmart Pay Account to a handheld gift card then pay for the gas that way. I sure hope Walmart does something about this because I personally wouldn’t use Savings Catcher and Walmart Pay if I’m not able to use my reimbursement money on anything I wanted."

4921,sassiegirl0518,"June 9, 2018",5,Hi It’s good but they should be faster at checking lower prices
4922,jdsindx,"June 9, 2018",1,Terrible! I’ve been trying to return an $80 item because it never got here and it keep telling me there is something wrong. Ive uninstalled it and reinstalled it. It’s that stupid update!
4923,carannstc,"June 13, 2018",3,Trouble Half the time this app does not load up when I am shopping ing the store
4924,ekholler,"June 16, 2018",1,"Unhappy Every time we are at this store they have a lack of cashiers!   Everyone is complaining and the lines are into the aisles!   If it weren’t for convenience, we would never shop this store"
4925,Kr1st1n3,"June 27, 2018",2,No option It doesn’t help you with what if you lost the card the money goes on. But overall good app
4926,Dafmom,"July 1, 2018",5,App The app is easier to navigate
4927,Monique Stansell,"July 2, 2018",5,Great service Great service all the time
4928,PDP-1,"July 3, 2018",1,Very Bad service Someone hacked in and used my 
4929,jollywallydoodle,"July 10, 2018",3,Lost money I had Aprox. $40 plus in my account and the app went down and I lost all my funds.

4931,Lsdr,"November 2, 2017",1,Crash Crashes while looking at order status.  Still crashes after update.
4932,Goodman106,"November 17, 2017",1,New update doesn’t work! Downloaded the new update now the app won’t work at all says I don’t have any connection. This is so annoying I just want to check on my order.
4933,averysweeley,"December 13, 2017",1,Update Latest update make is hard to use. So frustrating to look up things in categories. Going to have to start looking around at Wayfair
4934,Chefjhawk,"January 11, 2018",1,"Won't load items Even after updating it won't load searched items error comes up ""sorry can't load item"". WHY???"
4935,AWMinvestor,"February 2, 2018",2,Savings Catcher won’t accept receipt even when TC# and date keyed in Conversion to WMT seems to have messed up the app so I can’t enter my receipt and I have “two days left”
4936,little2crazy,"April 3, 2018",5,Best app ever! Easy Peasy!  Easy Money! 
4937,cp2874,"June 4, 2018",1,Grrrr App is always so slow to open when ever I’m inside of a Walmart! Especially when I want to scan a receipt on my way out of the store. All other times it works fine.
4938,Ms TMR48,"June 5, 2018",5,Shopper I love the Walmart savings . I hope they don’t quit it
4939,Jean Eileen,"June 6, 2018",5,Loving My Walmart I love using the Savings Catcher .. Ian a daily shopper and there’s no better store!😘
4940,Pudding and tame,"September 23, 2017",4,"Grandma Love this Walmart app, it has save us money. I would recommend this app to anyone."
4941,01lonewolf,"February 26, 2019",3,"Not what  it was Ok for shopping, but I used to use this primarily for savings catcher. Now it only work with Walmart Pay."
4942,Training III,"May 2, 2020",1,"Online service Unprofessional Items out of stock on sale, waiting all day to pickup, then got a message item out of stock money will be back in 3-10 days. Horrible"
4943,summef,"April 22, 2020",2,Crashes It’s a great and convenient app just wish it would stop crashing all the time
4944,Girlluvzombies,"April 17, 2020",1,"Still needs to be fixed I just updated this app and every time I go to check out in the grocery section, the app shuts down."
4945,Raven Hausman,"March 1, 2020",5,Raven Thanks for more secure stuff Acct still not right tho
4946,Moraskitchen,"October 6, 2019",1,"Lame Since the new update, the scan at this store option is no longer working. I’ll change my review once you guys fix it!"
4947,SonicAT53,"September 20, 2019",1,Doesn’t work since latest update I have tried several times to access my prescriptions. It just keeps clocking and locks up. Please fix this ASAP.
4948,Bsbsjusbsb,"August 9, 2019",1,Picky items Whats the point if half the stuff thats in store is saying I have to go shopping for it myself? Like if its in the store let me put it in my put cart for easy pick up.
4949,its2399,"July 13, 2019",1,Scanning Purchase Receipts This might have been an award winning app but it no longer is! It no longer saves purchase receipts to the app! That was a great feature you could if deleted savings catcher but YOU SHOULD OF KEEP THAT FEATURE ALONE! I WILL DELETE THE APP!!
4950,Sheen-gone,"November 4, 2018",1,"Terrible new update. Ditch the app! The new update doesn’t allow you to scan receipts anymore. So if you had a receipt a couple days old before the new savings catcher update, your SOL. Ditch the Walmart App!"
4951,MHTSOS,"November 4, 2018",1,"Receipt scanner gone When you take away, you push customers away. At least that is how I feel. "
4952,Scar1118,"November 8, 2018",1,Bad update The poor decision to not allow scanning the receipts via savings catcher on phone should be revisited. I do not want to hassle with my phone when checking out. This is very inconvenient.
4953,Angelicjlo,"November 10, 2018",1,Bring back the savings catcher Please bring back the savings catcher without having to use Walmart pay for purchasing. This is an unfair process. You are discriminating against cash customers!!
4954,janer1,"November 25, 2018",3,"Savings Catcher I may be behind the times, but just found out this week that savings catcher does not match produce or meat prices. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
4955,Morpheus171,"December 15, 2018",1,No Chase Pay They say you can but you can’t. Maybe just a thing with IOS. Maybe some real IT guys can fix the worthless app that lots of folks are not happy with. Costing Walmart some customer revenue.
4956,LeslieePaola,"January 3, 2019",1,"Inaccurate information App states the item was in stock, when arrived after driving 45 mins they said this app isn’t always correct."
4957,keisymorran,"February 7, 2019",1,Not 2 to 3 days free shipping I order I couple items that the wedsite say there where available for 2 to 3 days free shipping guess wat It pass more then 3 days and my items haven’t even been ship yet🤬
4958,.........why,"February 13, 2019",3,No more savings catcher Would have got 5 stars if savings catcher still worked.😕
4959,Lovesteph93,"February 14, 2019",1,Bring the old Savings Catcher back!! Caption says it all. I had a personal friend get his credit card info hacked from walmart pay so I refuse to put my info in. Bring the old system back.
