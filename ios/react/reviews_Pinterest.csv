0,-ÀãÀè Berri ÀéÀä-,"December 7, 2018",5,"No more stupid updates!!!! Everytime this app updates it becomes worse and worse, like I genuinely love Pinterest but I cant stand the updates it has, most of the time they are so annoying, other times it's okay but that was only when you had the selection option and you can arrange things but now you have gotten rid of it and now I can't even stand it anymore, I'm tired of seeing ads like every other pin than the ones I actually want to see, like I understand that it's a free app and all but why every other pin be an ad??? It wasn't like that before?? I see them so much that I just have to hide them and why is the hide option right next to the pin option too? That literally made things so confusing for the people who used it long time and would accidently hide a pin (personal experience) and sometimes there isn't an option to unhide either so your stuck with that pin gone forever. I will still use the app it's just much more unnecessary things here and there than what the consumer wants, or what I want. I still think it's a great app I just don't think these updates actually help Pinterest in anyway just making it worse than it actually is, Please start taking more consideration to the people who use Pinterest and figure out what is actually needed and what actually needs to be fixed before destroying the app. Thank you for reading"
1,Emu taco's,"March 4, 2020",4,"Love the app, hate the updates I love Pinterest but if you‚Äôre going to update the app and give me options of things to do, don‚Äôt take it away! I used to be able to like pins if I didn‚Äôt have a board to put it in. I can ‚Äúreact‚Äù to certain pictures but I can only use one reactions option and it‚Äôs not for all pins. So now I have a bunch of pointless boards so I can still see things that I like. I loved having the option of sections in boards because if I have a ‚Äúhouse work‚Äù board I can do a section with the bathroom, the bedroom, the living room, etc. It was a while since I updated and when I finally did, I wish I hadn't. I went to create sections for my travel board based on places to make it easier to plan my own trips and I can‚Äôt! I‚Äôm actually mad about this. And something that isn‚Äôt really a major issue but kinda disappointing is that when I come across a pin that I like and want to see more of, I tap on it. But sometimes it‚Äôs just an add and it takes me to a website. Which I guess I can see more by going through the website but I can usually access the website if I voluntarily tap on the picture after getting a preview. This is also the only app that closes out on me. I know it‚Äôs a free app and it takes a while to give the app its full potential but this isn‚Äôt really a new app anymore. Keep updates!!! When you bring in a new feature, don‚Äôt take it away from us! Some of us are (more like were) using those"
2,Avey gravy,"July 23, 2019",5,"‚ù§Ô∏èLove This App‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve had Pinterest for maybe about four days now and I love it. It‚Äôs a great app for ideas for a dream room, or a birthday party. On the other hand though, there is some issues. I don‚Äôt know weather or not to call these adds or adds that are pins, but some are inappropriate. Nothing real bad, but a lot of them show boobs! A child under 13 should probably not have this app. Another slight problem is that some pins take me to websites. Ok most people don‚Äôt have a problem with this, but I do I find it quite annoying. I don‚Äôt want to go to a whole other website, or download an app to learn how to loose weight, or do a diy. And if it isn‚Äôt going to take me to a website then it doesn‚Äôt tell me at all. If I click on a pin that says it will teach me how to whiten my teeth, and doesn‚Äôt show me how then how am I supposed to do it. Not all pins do either of these things of coarse. Pinterest is still a great app just some things need to be fixed. I have been addicted to this app despite my problems, so everything is still workable. I‚Äôm about to move, so this is app is really helpful currently. If the developers could just fix these slight bugs, I believe this would be a great and helpful app to all ages. Thanks for taking time to read my review if you did, and I hope it was helpful to those about to download the app."
3,janaisuarez,"April 30, 2020",5,"Story pins I really love this app but i do want to know how you make story pins, their very creative and I think that it was a very cool idea. Sombody said you have to have a certain amount of followers but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fare since is harder to get followers on Pinterest than on tik tok or Instagram, I don‚Äôt know though maybe I just have to turn it on in settings. I have 437 followers (which I think is a decent amount) but I can‚Äôt do the story pins so I‚Äôm really confused. I looked through the Pinterest app in the App Store and it said nothing about story pins......üòï"
4,Mrs. Hoffman,"November 19, 2019",5,Pinterest is the jack of all trades So I love love Pinterest and I always have!!  But I recently got the iPhone 10 max and now it just constantly freezes up when I‚Äôm on Pinterest for a while and my phone doesn‚Äôt do this on ANY other app or any other time. So I have no idea why it keeps doing this... but it is pretty aggravating. 
5,Tl333333::,"October 11, 2017",3,"Have I reached the end of Pinterest? I think I've reached the end of Pinterest! I keep seeing the same content over and over again. I only follow around 3000 people's Ms follow more every week. I have 9000 followers--which my number of followers slowed down significantly when they changed the feeds and algorithms. I can no longer see the people who follow me--even though my number of followers go up, it's no longer adding profiles to the followers section. I am so sick of seeing advertisements and sponsored content that have NOTHING to do with anything that I would ever want to see from Home Depot (I think we all kinda know about Home Depot at this point) to Pantene hair commercials. The settings for automatic video play do not work. And dare I use the ""show me more like this button""; CLEARLY Pinterest's taste level has a bug since it usually looks NOTHING like what I've just pinned. I preferred the only method of see who else has pinned this pinned so that you could start following others with your same taste level and subject matter. Pinterest has become almost as bad as Houzz for the masses and has become very hard to curate sophisticated collections of idea boards. I use Pinterest to work with my clients and promote my business. There are very few settings that you can change and I am so tired of seeing the same content over and over again! Oh wait, I already said that--well now you know how it feels!"
6,Fionajuliana,"September 17, 2019",2,"None of my comments are being saved to my pins! I mostly love Pinterest and the app, but there is definite room for improvement. Severely dislike the new way to search! Please go back to the way it was before this last update. Also, the constant refreshing means that as soon as I focus on a pin I might want to click on it‚Äôs gone. Please allow us Pinners to manually refresh our feed! Probably my biggest complaint is the lack of ability to edit the title or description of the pins we pin via the app. It was there and now exists only on the full site. Now I‚Äôm having to go back through EACH pin I‚Äôve saved in the last few weeks and edit EVERY ONE on my computer. PLEASE fix this! The comments are where we, as Pinners, get to add our own thoughts to the ideas we are pinning and it‚Äôs the way we can search our own pins to find the ones we‚Äôve saved. It is an essential function of the pinning process! That is the point right? To actually use the pins we save? Looking forward to having this bug squashed soon! Lastly, if I could have Pinterest the way I really liked it best I would return the like button and remove the tried button. I don‚Äôt really care who has tried a pin that I save. If I needed to gather several ideas quickly I would go through and like several pertinent pins so they were saved and go back to pin them later when I had time to add my own descriptions. Feeling nostalgic just now! Please bring back the likes! Thanks!"
7,Rosycheeks13,"December 28, 2017",5,Best thing ever Thanks to Pinterest I can express myself throughout creativity and just art boards and just all these boards that I can make and I can express myself through them I think my favorite two boards is probably my Jesus Christ one and my photography because those are two really important things in my life and this is a really great app for all ages and I do recommend it to anyone who is eligible to have it. And I first got it when I was about 11 and I just got an iPod not a phone but my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me have any kind of social media so this was kind of like a social media for me and I very much enjoyed it you can fine inappropriate things on there if you search them up I have never search them up but if you click on the wrong link or something it could lead to something so just be mindful when you have your kids on there it will ask you of like things that you‚Äôre interested in just make sure that you are looking over that because there are things on there that maybe you should look over with them other than that it‚Äôs an excellent app and in less you‚Äôre truly searching for something or you just click the wrong link you won‚Äôt find anything bad and I truly absolutely for the very last time do you recommend it to all thanks!
8,Kahleelee,"October 3, 2018",3,ALL Ads & Algorithm. NO (real) friends The Sponsored Pins are out of control. I see sponsored content more than I see my own friend‚Äôs post (and I mean face-to-face friends). On multiple occasions the sponsored posts have opened without any intentional interaction on my part; just from my scrolling through the app or when searching for something. But I have to put an effort just to see what an individual friend‚Äôs personal activity/recent pins. I feel like a creep. And now I‚Äôm getting told ‚ÄúHire an interior designer from [sponsor]‚Äù when I‚Äôm just tryna look at a bookcase! That‚Äôs too far. 
9,Beachinnbum,"June 19, 2019",5,"Pinterest user since 2011 I can‚Äôt imagine not having Pinterest. I could be without all other websites and social media, but the creative side of me needs my Pinterest fix. I‚Äôm able to organize all of my ideas which is great for me because my mind runs 90mph with these ideas every day either way. I love my secret boards. I love trying new things. This year I have a new raised garden bed and redoing my front yard. One of my favorite things about it is that I can make Pinterest my MAIN Wishlist/Registry I don‚Äôt have to make a bunch of different registries for events... I can add people to a board and pin things from ANY website. So I don‚Äôt have to remember all those passwords for those individual sites. (Example: You‚Äôre having a baby and want to have a Target Registry, Babies R Us Registry, Buy Buy Baby Registry, etc etc...) Instead of doing them all separately you can just pin all the products you want from those websites directly to ONE BOARD on Pinterest. You can add your friends and family to the board or you can just send them your board link. They can follow the link and look at everything you‚Äôve pinned in one place and make a purchase. You don‚Äôt need to create registries anymore. Everything I need is available on Pinterest. Thanks y‚Äôall!"
