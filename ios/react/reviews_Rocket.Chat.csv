My tabletop gaming group needed the flexibility of hosting our own chat server, and after surviving the ruin of HipChat and exile from River, we decided we were done with hosted services, both “free” and “for pay” alike. Now we have total control over our server, the freedom to invite as many players as we like, and the knowledge that our creative content is safe."
1,Jimmy Knuckles,"February 26, 2020",2,"Messagaes aren’t displayed The app is good for almost everything. The main problem is that it will “selectively” not display new messages. This has serious consequences when you type a response and see your response, and others have typed their responses and you don’t see them until you either force quit or some sort of refresh happens on the main page. It will also often place messages out of order if this behavior occurs within a room.  "
2,J K R 1234567890@#$&,"February 27, 2019",5,Cannot stop unwanted “forced” conversation feeds. There are 2 feeds that keep pushing their conversations on me that I have in two different ways tried to get stopped and no solutions.
3,harrybenson,"July 19, 2018",4,"Minor issues The new UI sadly wastes a lot of space in the channel list due to big avatars and lots of padding - I wish there was an optional compact/condensed channel view similar to what the previous version looked like so I wouldn’t have to scroll so much. When you choose to “group by favorites” and also “group by type”, the favorites aren’t grouped by type. Apart from those issues, there have been a lot of improvements. Being able to pick an app icon and choose between themes is neat."
4,johnmarki,"August 9, 2018",4,Not bad. Notifications broken again. When the Version 3 update came I finally got push notifications working flawlessly. Since I’ve updated to the most recent versions notifications are broken again. This app is only as good as the notification system. I give it 4 stars because it’s a huge step forward in version 3. But with the broken notification system my team and I have resorted back to texts until they fix it.
5,bugs181,"March 2, 2020",5,"Loving it I’ve tried them all! Slack, gitter, discord, etc... Rocket chat is amazing for one simple fact... You own your data! Self hosted solutions are the way to go. With all of the cloud providers for cheap, it’s a small price to pay for privacy, security, and not being locked into one vendor. Even worse if those companies go out of business or decide to randomly start charging users. Now, you don’t have to worry about that!"
6,Nickian,"January 28, 2020",4,"Great open source, self-hosted chat RocketChat is amazing open source software. The number of features and control you can have with your own server is great. My only complaint with the iOS app so far is that none of my LiveChat conversations appear here. I would love to access that on mobile. Generally, I wish RocketChat would laser focus on getting a few important features and UI/UX pieces rock solid before spending time on so many other experimental features."
7,finitetime,"April 27, 2020",4,"Lots of features, except the most important... Great little app for both iPhone and pc. Lot’s of cool and fun features rivaling Slack and other paid solutions. "
8,Rblackfox,"November 27, 2018",4,"J The layout and look are really nice! But accessing directories listings, a key component of new communities I build, is missing. The complete navigation of the web app must be the same as in the mobile app. Until that happens I will never recommend this app to a client for real world use unfortunately. Users need to be able to search and join channels in the app. Get that nav complete and fix a few of the video/photo uploads you have a really nice platform!"
9,AlixanderWill,"June 11, 2019",5,"Best Chat Solution for a Small Business! I setup a server for my work team, and this tool is incredible. Highly customizable if you have a good dev on your team and incredibly useful! It's like Slack but for a fraction of the price, way more control, and no limits!! Even with development cost, it's still way cheaper than a 5 man team on Slack. And open-source!!! I'll never use anything else!"
10,LasagnaCat,"April 27, 2018",1,Similar to Discord :/ ? Upon downloading this and thinking it’d be a lot different from most other chat-server-apps.. I realized that a lot of it looks very similar to how Discord is(which was one chat-server-app i really enjoyed using.) I heard about this and thought I’d try it out since the person said it’s very different from most others. This is just without the ability to be in different servers and server user lists. Not too sure what this has that Discord doesn’t.
11,HunterTabber,"June 24, 2018",1,Not a Replacement for Their “Legacy” product Being told to upgrade to this app from their now legacy app is very annoying when this app will not even connect!  This is NOT a drop-in replacement for the “legacy” app.
12,SebaLukic,"June 29, 2018",4,"Almost there The only issue and the biggest one that I have with this app is that it doesn’t notify me, or at least give me an option to be notified when in a specific chat room. I can miss so many messages and it can be frustrating going through all of those messages. Give us an option to choose if we want to be notified in a specific chat room, not only if we are tagged."
13,BWheetley,"August 8, 2018",4,Overall good but... Overall this is a pretty nice chat app. There has always been an issue where I rarely get push notifications. Also the last couple updates have broken my ability to upload photos. I’ve deleted and reinstalled but that didn’t fix it.
14,Abbie Wilson,"August 30, 2018",2,"Runs too slow Would be an awesome app if it wasn’t so slow. If we have just a couple of people in a chat, I can’t literally type out my whole comment before it shows up on the screen. Takes almost a minute after I’m done for it to appear and I can click to send the comment. If someone else is tying while you’re typing, good luck being able to type. After the update I figured it would be fixed, it wasn’t. It seems they don’t really care how it runs for some reason."
15,this portion is unnecessary,"March 26, 2020",2,"Unnecessarily difficult You don’t have to reinvent the wheel here, but this application is less of a rocket and more of a slingshot. Status update doesn’t change when attempting to change from visible, ghost, away, offline. Adding pictures and gifs is unnecessarily difficult (not a big deal but it’s part of our communication style now a days). Alerts and messages don’t always come through even with alerts on. It’s encrypted... only plus. Please make this better, this is what my company chose to use and it’s rough."
16,jk234ert,"September 25, 2019",4,"Good app, but has crash issue in some situation Not bad in most situation, but the app crashes frequently when I open it and directly navigate to a “chat”. This is a bit annoying that I have to wait for the data refreshing in the main chat list page, then choose the chat I want to dig  into."
17,lkr 666,"September 2, 2019",4,"Good app for self-hosted server Took one star off because the admin interface is not optimized to work on mobile. As the admin of multiple servers, it's a bit of a pain to use that part of the app."
18,JlkAustinATX,"December 14, 2019",1,"The upgrade basically made RC unusable I use RC for work and I am part of several regular channels and some private ones. After I updated to the latest version, now I’m not part of any of the regular channels anymore. It says I have to “join” again. If I select to join nothing happens. If I try to send a message, the app crashes. And all the private channels I was part of no longer display in the directory. What did this version do?!?! This update has made RC unusable for me."
19,rezatea,"June 27, 2019",5,Notifications and seen The only problem I have is that notifications and unseen messages are stubborn! They won't become seen after they actually are in other clients.
