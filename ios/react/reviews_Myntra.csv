0,dandolifanfi,12 December 2019,1,"Thief Myntra Thief I ordered through Myntra for 2 Belts (reversible), but they sent me the non-reversible belt. I contacted the customer service for replacement, and they instead refunded for 1 belt without consenting me and sent wrong once 3 times for the remaining belt. I called again and shouted, they committed they would be delivering it by Saturday 26th October no matter what happens and I did not receive it. I ordered it for the especially Diwali occasion, and they did not send me. This entire procedure took almost 20 days with no resolution or belt. I had to use the belt as no shops were opened on New Year for selling the belt. I contacted them again via email for an update, and they kept asking for to have a label attached to the belt which I threw away because they never reached me for it. Lastly, I had to abuse them in the email as they didn't do anything. I opened a dispute in PayPal as well; however; I missed to escalate to PayPal and it went to buyers favour. It's not about the 300 rupees but its also about the fake product that they sell. I purchased a Roaster watch worth rupees 1200, and few of the functions were like toys, they never function, as a kind of showpiece. The same happened earlier as well. Since the service and the products are worse, I am lodging a case in Consumer court as thieves like Myntra should be shut down."
1,RamD123,27 August 2019,1,"Bad retention and customer harassment I am totally disappointed with the Myntra shopping experience, I didn’t use my Myntra account for sometime and today when I came back, I noticed that I was charged 150 rs shipping fee even when my order exceeded the minimum shopping price for free delivery. So I find this notification that there is some fair policy and all. I immediately checked my order history and it’s showing empty and don’t see anything in order archive even. I wanted to check how have I abused the fair policy. When you say easy returns and all, and on the other side you say abusing fair policy. So I need to understand this policy and this should be mentioned prior to our shopping experience and not later. Rather than customer satisfaction you are harassing the customer. Also on calling the help desk, they are of no help and no email address is provided to have a formal discussion over email. This is seriously pathetic and annoying. You should seriously have better policies in place to have better customer satisfaction and if the product doesn’t suit the customer, they will return it, like if we buy things from a shopping mall and return, they don’t charge us extra. This is an unfair and absurd policy."
2,Sana Dadani,30 January 2019,1,Very disappointing and unsatisfactory service The primary goal of the app is to be customer friendly and to be of service and when failed on this regard to be of help but this does not seem the case with this app. I ordered a jacket for which the all inclusive bill was shown 471 but on delivery the product bill was 620 because they added delivery charges to it which I do not oppose but I want to be well informed about it. On calling the customer care they tell me that if I had done bank transfer the bill would have shown it but did not show because it was COD. Well then thank you for playing surprise surprise with the customers who have ordered it with COD. Also then the product comes in defective not once but twice! And on complaining they say that I have to wait 72hours for the complaint to process and then additional time for the exchange to happen. Gee thanks!! Now I not only have paid a surprise 149 Rs but don’t even have the jacket to take it where I want to. Thank you Myntra for being a part reason for me getting hypothermia. The best part is on complaining all they have to offer you is a pretend sorry and nothing else. Thank you again Myntra now I have another sorry to add to my jar :)
3,zaki7860,10 May 2019,1,"Myntra’s customer service is PATHETIC and HORRIBLE!! I ordered an expensive diesel brand wrist watch few days ago and when I received the order I found the additional leather strap was missing in the box. When I contacted Myntra’s customer care, I was told that I have to wait until 6th May 2019 only to know what will be the next action from Myntra. I received a message within 6days from Myntra that my product will be returned. However, I only wanted to have the leather strap back which was missing since I wanted to avoid further delay of having the complete product but to my dismay, when I called customer care on 6th I was assured on call that my product will be exchanged."
4,kuldeep patil,15 January 2020,1,Frauds I had ordered an Indian Terrain Black T-Shirt and due to fitting issues placed a return request. The Myntra delivery person came to my home and asked for return item. So like every time just handed it over. Then received a message saying “your return has been rescheduled and will be picked up by tomorrow “next day the fu..k..ng person came to home asking for a return item. I told in irritation that you only collected last say. He said yes I remember. Then I received same return rescheduled message and no one came to home. After 2 days got messages saying Return has been cancelled.
5,RN0803,25 April 2020,1,"Cheaters.... I had placed an order n received a defected product (torn one). When i asked fr a replacement, myntra logistics guys said d product is torn so cannot b replaced. The reason y i askd fr a replacement is bcos it was torn. I made several calls, bt to my surprise i find out that there is no sync or coordination between d shipping guys, the delivery guys and myntra guys. All d customer care executives seem lost, n every time i called i had to explain my case from d very beginning, even though it is all available with them. Theirs supervisors too seem lost n couldnt provide me a solution. Finally widout me even asking for it, they cancel my order n its been a month plus now n I still have nt received a call for pickup nor d money refunded. I feel cheated n looted of my money. Have been a myntra customer since the last 8 years, bt with this experience i will never ever use myntra again n will also recommend ma friends n family too, to stop using Myntra.. Pathetic service n pathetic people."
6,surbhi baser,28 December 2018,1,Very low quality services with zero customer satisfaction I am a very prime customer of myntra .every month i ordered something and in recent sale i have place an order of 15k bucks. I have order one puma shoe pair and one here and now jeans and 2 jackets of fort collins. I have place the order on 20thdec and on 22nd dec i received the 2 fort collins jackets only while the bill inside the packet is of 2 fort collins jacket and one puma shoes and one hear and now jeans. I make a complaint to customer care executive with in an hour after calling to the delivery boy. They raised my complaints and after every day follow up and hours of calls on hold they said on 27th dec they will refund my profucts amount but later they call me on 28th dec and said as per our checking they already delivered the products so they cannot make the refund. I have been polite with all the executives during the conversation and be in patience for 6 days but all in vain. I really didn’t expect this from myntra. Does not even deserve this one star for the services guys. Not going to buy again and ask to the people to not go for this shopping website.
7,bhau rathore,21 May 2019,1,"Name should be defected shop instead of myntra and refuse to take back once delivered Have been a long time Myntra Customer.. But I guess won't be shopping with Myntra anymore with the kind of experience I had yesterday.. Bought a pair of ASICS SHOES 2days ago but as soon as I opened the packet and checked the shoes it was not fresh and not appealing as the image, I straight away raised a cancelation request. The pickup guy came yesterday, he accepted it with no questions asked and was about to pack it but I stupidly just as a feedback told him what the issue is so that other customers don't face such issues, showed him the defect and what do you know he refused to take it saying they don't accept defective items.. I called customer services and the guy there also told me that they'll investigate it first and they'll probably get in touch with me through Email.. I even told the customer service guy I can send them the Pic of the defect but was asked to wait for the Email.. What an absolute load of rubbish.. First send a defective piece to your Customer and when they provide you a feedback  give them a run around"
8,jdidocox,15 March 2019,1,Bad customer service and delivery partner I shop a lot from Myntra and I recently placed an order and it was not delivered on time. My order was out for deliverysince two   days and it got delivered on the third day. This happened with me twice The contact number provided of the delivery executive is always not reachable. I complained about the situation twice and i only got a reply from the customer support to wait for 72 hours. Even if the complaint is about the late delivery because of their delivery partner they ask you to wait for 72 hours idk for what. 
9,divya divyani,31 December 2019,1,Fraud Myntra started cheating customers I have ordered a faballey top of 670rs women’s top wear and they have delivered me a men’s shirt of rs370. They delivered me wrong product even some other person name was return on top of it they packed it my name’s label. I have raised a return request but delivery person rejected to take back the product and asked me to raise a complaint in customer care. I have called up customer care people they raised a complaint taken all the details barcode and all. They said it will be resolved by 4 to 5days. I waited for that and I received a txt msg that your issue is being resolved and return of product is declined what rubbish is this. I contacted them they said itz just declined the person who was speaking(customer care executive) he was even unable to explain the reason why it’s rejected. Again he askd me all the details and said that he wil raise a complaint again. Is this a joke what rubbish myntra is doing. This is not just done fraud issue . I used to shop a lot from myntra but now I have got a lesson worst service.
