0,er_got,"May 4, 2018",1,"It would be difficult to produce a worse SalesForce app What a horrendous, awful application. This app is bad enough that it is often touted as the reason that people in my organization are unable to do 100% of their work from an iPad Pro - “I’d love to, but I need to use SalesForce on a consistent basis”. If SalesForce is Hugh Grant, SalesForce1 is Andie MacDowell; dragging down the entire operation, forcing constant recaptures of her dialog because she’s unable to enunciate properly, and generally making the whole process feel much more like a funeral than any of the four weddings. "
1,Centersj,"February 27, 2020",1,"New Update - OUCH The latest update was recently pushed to my iOS device. I know this is a new design, but navigating is the most painful experience I’ve ever had with an App. As a project manager who travels periodically I rely on this application to manage my projects. I am no longer able to see a list of my projects or even access them without digging so deep into the interface that I am ready to pull my hair out once I finally get to where I’m going."
2,jtr02a,"February 16, 2018",2,"Ok, when it works Using app on an iPhone X and have constant issues. When I click a SF link that opens in the app, it only works occasionally... most of the time it never loads the screen. Additionally, reports of any size are practically unusable. Furthermore, when attempting to log a call, it should be more intuitive (checking matching leads/contacts/accounts in close proximity to the device). Instead the user has to perform a specific search and hope the results are relevant (and actually show up). For the amount of money spent on SF, one would hope to see a better thought-out and more thoroughly tested app. Very disappointing; my outside sales reps continually tell me it is easier to boot up their laptop to log a call then try to frustrate themselves with the app."
3,rsearle13,"June 28, 2019",2,"Great system, just never runs smoothly. Salesforce would be a great system if it would run smoothly, which it rarely does. On a desktop it can get really glitchy and I’ll lose information I just finished inputting, it gets stuck scrolling, or it starts backing the page up every time I hit backspace. "
4,colt____45,"November 7, 2019",5,Wish I didn’t have to use this My market just started rolling this app out. I don’t think a single person I work with likes this garbage. I especially hate it when putting in my time for the week. It’s extremely frustrating just to put your time in. I’ve just stopped doing it went back to the old system we use. It’s always glitchy and people can’t get anything done on this. Just looking at the platform and how they have it set up makes me cringe. It makes everything we do harder than it is and this is just my opinion but why...WHY ARE WE USING THIS!??
5,Reese125,"February 17, 2018",3,"Horrible user experience -needs overhaul A $112 stock, millions of users do business on their Androids/iPhone every day, but yet the developers of this app still don’t get it or flat out don’t care because they are more concerned with business to business functionality."
6,ctay9,"August 25, 2019",1,"Do better, salesforce. Unfortunately, my organization uses this junk of an app. The app has so many bugs. Home screen loads a blank page, when trying to log back in there are numerous error codes. The help instructions from Salesforce are vague and don’t provide help. No live chat with support. Try to reset password using the user name and NO reset email goes out. Their URL login no longer works - and throws back error messages. You can use your login credentials to get in, but as soon as you close the app then the credentials disappear. Why would anyone want to entered a password every time you open the app? When you close the app and immediately reopen it, then you have to start the login error cycle again. Frustrating beyond belief. Do better salesforce."
7,SparksCVEN,"April 26, 2018",2,"Terrible User Experience I am very much a fan of integrating technology with business, but this application is wretched.  I cannot believe this is not an app in Beta.  The load times are horrible, I find myself clicking 100 buttons to get to something that should be readily available. The menus are confusing and not helpful.  Links to projects do not work, and I am constantly having to reload the app because it will not load images.  "
8,DNA Kruis,"August 28, 2017",5,!!! Amazing Tool !!! You can't find a better more tuned tool anywhere. Once you learn all of the options and use them your on your way to a very successful sales career. The only thing that's slowing this program down would be the person thats not using it.. I would like to personally thank those people that don't use this tool. Thanks to you I've gained more sales and more money....
9,MattLax2020,"March 11, 2020",1,"Great CRM, Terrible Mobile App I am a huge fan of Salesforce, i have always spoke very highly of your company. The company i work for uses Salesforce. The overall CRM platform is very useful from a desktop, there are many ways to run specific reports and capitalize on opportunities with customers. "
10,lockalicious,"August 4, 2017",5,It's quick and easy There are other apps that are better at pipeline management like clari etc but SF1 is a simplified version of the web vetsuon perfect for sales people needing to input and capture meeting notes and look at a high level opps or contacts on the go. In other words it's not as robust as the web version but the UI is much better in terms of workflow for people on the go and it is fast. Can't create RFx activities but can input notes and chatter is easy.
11,SkeevieWonder,"August 21, 2017",2,"Terrible App The purported purpose of this app is to make things quick and simple, so you can enter information easily on the go. This app fails miserably."
12,PC Field Tech,"September 21, 2017",3,"PC Field Tech My employer uses this app for dispatching tickets to myself and other techs to document work we do. I believe the app can have more features such as different statuses like EnRoute to Site, OnSite, etc. My previous employer used EFS when I started working with them and then began using Clearvision. I would have to say those are better and user friendly with more features compared to using this app. Overall, the app is not that bad but it can use more features and have improvements. That's why I only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 stars."
13,dontpeonme,"May 11, 2018",1,"Rarely works Update after update this app continues to disappoint. The only functionality that always works is the chatter feature which I seriously don’t care about. I haven’t been able to search for an account for months and the scheduler feature doesn’t ever load, always says no internet connection. I’ve checked, I’m connected. Whether it’s a WiFi connection or over LTE in the field says “no internet connection tap to reload”. So I tap, it spins, I give up, open my laptop or iPad, find the record I need and move along. I keep thinking the app will work and to my dismay it never does. Salesforce mobile app, this is your precipice. Until the functionality is actually working this is a waste of time."
14,Hotel Employee,"May 22, 2018",3,"Sales Force is Laggy/Bad Updates Our hotel is state of the art and brand new, which means we have top tier technology. Despite our strong Wi-Fi signals throughout the hotel, I often find myself waiting for the program to finish loading. Also, their have been some unfortunate updates. An example would be in previous versions we could see all the different statuses of cases at once. That way we could quickly take notice of cases that were potentially overlooked. In a newer update, they removed this option. Because of these issues, I give it a very GENEROUS 3 stars."
15,RochelleW,"October 16, 2018",3,"Bugs in switching records Generally a handy app that allows me to get deals through the approvals pipeline even when I’m not in the office. However, I’ve run into bugs that will open a prior record repeatedly when switching between screens, e.g., attachments and approval history. This means that if I view one record and then want to edit a second record, I have to be really careful not to accidentally edit the wrong record, and usually have to close and reopen the app to “force” it to flush the memory. This is a significant detriment to efficiency."
16,Mykasintahan,"March 14, 2019",2,Not a smooth workflow I rely on Salesforce for everything at work.  I cannot stand the mobile application. It freezes up and lags very often. I have never used the application without it crashing. I manage multiple employees that perform service work and travel. It would greatly improve our workflow and mobility if this application had cleaner navigation and stability. 
17,Namaste125,"October 2, 2019",5,Connection The app itself works really nicely and I enjoy the way it’s layout is the only problem is I wish there was an off-line version that later reports once connected to the Internet that way if you’re working at a low cell signal area were still able to effectively report and use the app. I love the app but the fact that it requires a connection to the Internet makes it quite difficult in my particular territory where they are dead spots for signal.
18,katrinka az,"September 5, 2019",5,"Brilliant. So much more user-friendly. The new community website makes it so much easier to communicate, get and share information. The fact that it sends an email whenever there is a new posting makes it super easy to use, eliminating the need to login just to see if there happens to be any new postings. Also the fact that everything about each Wish Child is in one central location makes it very efficient. "
19,auebej,"July 16, 2019",5,"Ongoing bug Please look into the glitch that is constantly requiring me to delete the app and reinstall for a “temporary” solution to timing out randomly where I can no longer access accounts info. I’ve heard from IT there will be a new update soon but this is getting extremely frustrating. It only happens with the app. Otherwise, it is an incredibly useful tool that normally operates at the highest level of efficiency."
20,1jmp,"August 30, 2017",4,"For what I do SF App works pretty good. I have been using app for about 5 yrs? Give or take. I would give the app a 5 except it does not incorporate a chunk of functions/lists that I use on the desk top version. ( yet) That said, I post pictures, have access to many functions and objects we created for our work reports and data tracking that are essential to reporting for my work as a field rep. I can't imagine going back to using any other program."
21,Mikerey,"November 4, 2017",5,"Great tool to keep up on things -company This is a great tool to keep up on things dealing with my company. I like the connectivity to current things going on in the company, being able to check my different dashboards, check on statuses of tickets, and other things. "
22,Jbrobinson413,"February 13, 2018",1,"Slow and buggy For as much as they tout a great mobile experience, this app has always been frustrating. It's incredibly slow and constantly has bugs. Today all my search results show empty boxes instead of the record names. Last week I kept getting redirected to a page that told me a needed a Salesforce engage license (the pages I was looking at were standard object records). "
23,MassDem,"March 9, 2018",5,Really? I’m disappointed. The Mobile UI is clunky and has limited ability to render any meaningful reports or Dashboards. Even logging a call in relationship to an opportunity is just plain clumsy.  
24,Orlando2517,"June 9, 2018",4,"Great interface, needs file upload I can get most essential things done on the move and I love it. Ability to upload files (not just photos) from cloud platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive would be really nice. Ability to add files right into the opportunity files screen (instead of going into the separate Files menu THEN the opportunity to link the file to it) would be amazing."
25,zxcfgtywe,"December 21, 2018",5,"Simplification While Salesforce has many good attributes I think that simplification of use could be worked on. It often has I.T. Issues and is finicky. Training on Salesforce should focus only initially what data a Sales rep needs to enter. Practice, practice, practice with an instructor until they guarantee you have it done 100% correctly would be the wisest way to train."
26,Akl81,"January 30, 2019",5,"Great App! As a social worker/case manager, I use this app to write notes when I am out in the field. It is very to be able to write notes and complete client assessments while in the field. The only ""con"" of this app is that the interface is a little different from the website, so it takes a little figuring out, but since learning the app, it is a wonderful tool."
27,oahucap,"May 2, 2019",4,"Lightening transition If certain things can be made a default like “Log a Call”, “New Note”, it would make things smoother on transition.  "
28,SUJovian,"July 18, 2019",1,"Complex formulas support Amazingly, the app doesn’t support salesforce’s most advanced customers who leverage the platform most comprehensively. The mobile app won’t allow me to open any opportunities because they have “too many formula fields with complex formulas”. The same goes for mobile safari. If I use desktop mode on mobile chrome, it loads perfectly fine. This issue has persisted for years with no fix. There is zero excuse for Salesforce to leave this functionality broken for so long. It makes our enterprise deployment (one of the biggest tech firms in the world) deficient on mobile devices."
29,Northern Beast 78,"February 13, 2020",4,"Great software when not over done Salesforce has been a valuable tool but as our company kept adding more layers it became very cumbersome along with more lags and errors. SF does not sell it helps manage, don’t make it too complex unless the layers are added to reduce administrative tasks such as automatically tying opps to part numbers and then have those opps close if/when purchased to help the flow and accuracy of our pipeline."
30,Mr Toner,"November 13, 2017",3,"Not my daily driver Most comments that I would make about this app are really directed at the service. But there are two things that annoy me greatly about the app: one, there is no list of all of my leads or contacts, only a list of recently added/edited/viewed people, and, two, the app is slower than I would expect. Both of these, I believe, are due to the app being a wrapper around a Web view. In any case, I can’t imagine using the app on a daily basis."
31,TGGAKUSA,"January 5, 2018",2,"Eeh It does the trick but why can’t it do so much more? I can not stand entering in events and the date and time don’t auto populate to a one hour window. It’s just a time waster. Also I would like to see the ability to link to proposals on the account and to be able to access them off my opportunities. Generating proposals would be too much to ask but it would be amazing if this was possible. Otherwise it aids to my on the road schedule but if there wasn’t an app, I don’t think I would miss much."
32,Gredd,"September 17, 2018",5,"Sky is the limit Not being a developer, I was unsure about the potential flexibility and robustness of Salesforce.  It is off the charts and I have only spent a few weeks (part time) learning a few basics. I am starting to see (with each trailhead project) how interrelated and sophisticated this program really is. Truly, the potential is endless. And great support as well"
33,BIGREDMRO,"October 17, 2018",5,"Works good If I do not constantly back out of my accounts and categories within them, then my app will usually crash in a day or 2. "
34,Mojo113,"October 24, 2018",5,Great app but could use improvements App is an awesome resource  that maximizes my ability to manage my accounts and Information. App could use improvements glitchy and crashes fairly often could use some more fluidity as far as going from the map to accounts. All in all great resource.
35,russellboyer,"February 14, 2019",5,Garett tool Love the salesforce app. It help keep me organized and knowing what projects I have at each of my locations. The reports I can run are helpful. There are a few bugs but the staff at salesforce quickly resolves any problems. I gave it 5 stars even though there is a couple of things I wish it would do as a rep out in the field
36,lostlife1978,"July 5, 2019",4,"Great when it works Hey leave the application alone.  Stop with all the stupid updates.   Can’t even search for items because it says that there’s “no internet connection” and I am on full bars and full service area.  I can access all other sites to include banking, payments but yet can’t use your application after you perform your stupid updates.  STOP UPDATING SOMETHING THAT WORKS.  IF IT’S NOT BROKEN DON’T FIX IT!!!!!!!!"
37,jks-jks,"January 14, 2020",2,"App is very slow  and constantly loading You can do what you need with this app, however, it seems very few items are being loaded in memory,  as a result, every navigation users experience some sort of loading interface that dramaticallly slows down the experience when compared to a web browser interface. "
38,Sjake072,"March 28, 2020",2,Unimpressed withSalesforce This is more a review of Salesforce overall. We’ve been on it for about 6 months and I’ve never seen such a learning curve. Training was worthless. Now it’s on each of us to work through this clunky software. Takes way too much time to figure things out. So much time away from managing selling and building customer relationships. I can’t imagine what we paid for it but if I sold my products to my customers that operated this poorly I’d be out of business.
39,shejon,"November 27, 2019",5,Salesforce is amazing The app is incredible. So easy to use. I have all the data I need in front of me in seconds. No need to open my laptop. I travel a lot and hate opening up my laptop in the airport. This app has helped me tremendously. Having some syncing issues but the team is working on it. Great support network.
40,Jmm0711,"September 5, 2017",5,"Needs major overhaul I love Salesforce and am a proud Administrator/Developer for my company but the app needs major work. It is slow, does not load, has a weak user interface and needs to be updated. I hope this is happening in the near future because it's only become frustrating recently."
41,TyGreeny,"October 17, 2017",2,Slow and Difficult I'm in sales for a company that uses Salesforce. 
42,Dan D11b,"June 18, 2018",3,"Disappointment This app is ok when it works. It is extremely slow. It does not mirror the website and is not intuitive. When i click a SF link in my mobile email it rarely loads and screen is often blank. It is actually quicker to open my laptop, connect to a hotspot and go to sf on the web. For as much money spent on sf it is disappointing their app is probably the one of the 10-15 worst i have ever used."
43,barbdw,"January 2, 2019",3,Would like access to more options I am aware that Salesforce is very flexible however our access to some things is very limited. I could really use the option to sort my contacts by stage. I would also like to be able to see the full status of associates at the point in my mobile app. Right now it’s just an abbreviation and doesn’t allow us to see the actual status.
44,Susiealloos,"February 21, 2019",3,Relationship Anyone who is connected by relationship should always stay together even when the account is moved from one person to another. 
45,Jc62504,"March 30, 2019",5,Best CRM and business solution ever created. I’ve tried more than 13 CRM programs over the years. They all look good until you start working in them and then you realize their limitations. Salesforce is the only one that doesn’t disappoint! It is customizable to work the way your business operates. 
46,Money Saving Jess,"April 5, 2019",3,It’s okay— but really needs improvement I am on the road right now.  I am able to view the accounts.  Mostly create leads.  But it isn’t accepting my addresses.  Then I try to verify the address and it says I did.  But then will not allow me to convert so I can add my discussion notes to the account.  
47,Persuasion812,"May 14, 2019",5,"Suggestion I only use this application when I am away from my laptop. What would be very helpful would be a business card application directly on the mobile application. I see some of the third party applications, but they are either very expensive, unreliable, or both."
48,KAG 2.6,"February 3, 2020",4,"Helpful but limited! I find the app most helpful for quick updates to accounts or reviews of notes/contact info/etc. Using the full site on a computer is preferable for long periods of work or updating significant amounts of data. Unfortunately, I find the size of phones just limits SF use. But the app still gives me full access!"
49,Alimen831,"July 1, 2019",5,"Glitch SF mobile is amazing and helps while on the go.  In the past week and half I have been experiencing a glitch when I type in an account’s name and press enter, it takes me to the mobile home screen.  I am not able to go directly to the account’s page."
50,G - pHresh,"September 18, 2017",2,"Wish you could edit everything in the app I prefer to use my laptop when checking Salesforce since I can actually edit everything there.  When I use any of these apps, via iPhone or iPad, I can only view what I have done back at the office.  If this can be fixed, then I will change it to 5 stars otherwise if you just want to view everything and not edit it, then  I will just have to work with what I have"
51,IHSimitator,"October 25, 2017",5,"Customer Retention Management Made Easy Prior to using SF, finding customer info and tracking history as well as managing future opportunities was very splintered and taxing."
52,Dabenow!!,"December 10, 2017",3,More editing Salesforce needs to be more customizable. I want to be able to change the default response times and other things that you won’t let me. I know I can override the response time for each case but ELA times are how we run reports to measure up to brand standard which is HUGE to all hotels. I have to take a lot of other extra steps to get to my goal with many different things.
53,Vegging gyxddb,"January 5, 2018",5,"Taking my office and mission on the go! Salesforce1 makes it possible for me to be available and informed whenever, wherever.  That’s so helpful because I’m running a not for profit in Uganda while managing a busy life with kids at home and on the go.  Sounds impossible? It probably would be without this app! ;)"
54,breauj,"January 16, 2018",5,"Market Manager I love SalesForce mobile. When I don’t have my laptop I can still create opportunities, look up orders and have access to my drawing log. I can be in an impromptu meeting at customer site in the hall way and I can pull up open opportunities, past orders and access to my drawing logs. A must have."
55,Growth Engineer,"February 22, 2018",5,Solid app Information at my fingertips for when I’m on the road is great. Logging sales calls via voice to text is awesome.
56,Davedisimo,"February 14, 2019",1,"Terrible app I just can’t believe that a CMR multi billionaire company has the worst app developer.(Probably are themselves). As a service worker access to my calendar is vital in my day to day and I can’t access to it directly, if I check on any task there is no way to go back directly to my calendar, the app get stocked, the only solution is start over from the main screen. Uploading documents is a pain, the dashboards are limited in sorts, in general this app is a mess. I don’t recommend it, if you’re able to hire a different CMR don’t hesitate."
57,Ghossst36,"February 26, 2019",3,Good but Not so good Here I am trying to keep track of everything only to be held up because the pages are always not loading. At first I thought it was a signal issue but not. I’m currently reloading the whole app. 
58,Beto 214,"December 26, 2019",5,"Salesforce There are issues that prohibit me from working efficiently. Seeing that I can’t see my service requests, create service requests or my work orders, it makes it difficult to rate anything higher. I might have it rated a little high but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt."
59,connor5432,"September 8, 2019",2,"App crashes every few min I love the power that Salesforce gives you as a salesperson but it literally crashes every few minutes. If I’m going from my map into accounts it’s not an uncommon site to have to completely restart the app to get it to work again. The desktop website isn’t much better when your dealing with any kind of mapping, be sure to save every few min or your work could easily be lost."
60,Still the worst on my phone.,"December 7, 2017",1,Worst performing app on my phone (Updated review 2 Years later. I would just add the word “Still” to my last review)
61,Annonymous #2,"June 27, 2018",5,"Salesforce Review Its too slow for me. Cant keep up with how fast I have to move within the day. I waste a lot of time refreshing and clearing the cache. Sometimes I want to throw my phone out the car window, but I really do enjoy the concept. Needs to speed up!!!!"
62,hyattl,"August 16, 2018",2,"There are many reasons why the CRM is awesome... but iOS version is not one of them! Not user friendly, nor does it even come close to resembling any functionality of SF on a browser (in classic or lightening view). "
63,Orphilips,"September 5, 2018",3,Seems buggy My app seems to load very slow and every 3-4 items I have to wait for it to load more. Seems like a waste of time they need to redesign the information to load quicker and smoother for a more seamless experience. Also since my company added my fields I can no longer view opportunities in the app because it states there is too many fields.
64,bagbj,"February 14, 2020",5,"Loading Screen Once I open the app, only Loading shows up  on the screen and nothing after it. Need immediate attention. It was working perfect two days ago but something happened. Pleas check"
65,CarmineGF,"October 31, 2019",5,"CRM in your pocket Love this app.  I can update deals, call customers and prospects, and collaborate with everyone in my company from anywhere!  Every release is noticeably better, as more capabilities are available.   Virtually anything important about my customers is 1-2 clicks away.  Powerful!"
66,JADR8,"July 11, 2019",5,Lightning performance... We’re making heavy use of dashboards... some of our sales team have come up with an alternative name for lightning - they call it Turtle. Would like to see improved performance if possible to help our sales team be more productive.
67,Paulele777,"February 20, 2020",1,"Not User Friendly Too many clicks to do simple things.  I’m in a task to do a follow up phone call but need to click numerous places to find the phone number and contact name.  Then to change a date of an old task, you have to click change date, then click on the date to change the date.  Not to mention it’s not even a calendar, it’s just a list to choose from so you can’t see the day of the week etc.  Very bad app.  Pipedrive works much better."
68,JP_Hokie,"September 18, 2019",5,"Great business app! The Salesforce app is easy to use, has almost all of the functionality of the desktop app, and helps me to stay up to date with all of my customers. I wish wish more business apps were as easy to use."
69,TakenApp2,"September 13, 2019",2,Mileage The app is terrible. #1 issue is that cannot calculate mileage for beans. #2 good luck checking into a place you have been able to check into for the past year and all of a sudden it won’t let you check in. #3 Crashes a lot. Have to delete the app and then re-download it an hope it works. I have to use this daily for work and I have to send in a separate mileage form because it won’t calculate.
70,Eisbrecher12,"October 25, 2017",3,"Generally useful - serious hang time This app is pretty essential to being able to find client information in the field.  I travel, so I live off of my phone and often have to use the app over the site.  It is organized well, but I have a lot of issues with pages loading slowly or coming in completely blank."
71,goingback2,"February 23, 2018",2,"If it only worked... When it actually works it’s great. However it’s never, ever works consistently. I have to completely close the app each time or it gets stuck on the home screen or the last screen I was on. I can’t switch from calendar to contacts or anything else because it locks up. I’m constantly closing the app and reopening to continue using it.  I use it on an iPhone and it’s just painful."
72,Sde 719,"July 23, 2018",3,Not user friendly I can’t find a lot of info I’m looking for. It’s not user friendly. It gives “just enough” info on the app... “just enough” to get a high level but you can’t dive into an account. “Just enough” to get you a little frustrated and want to go back to the website! Not horrible but definitely needs improvement.
73,userBV,"February 7, 2019",3,Could be even better Wished that you could send out email templates that you’ve customized FROM THE APP!! from

It’ll say drag to move but the whole screen shifts and you cannot move the opportunity. It is not formatted for 7plus screen as when you click an opportunity the preview is larger than the screen, you cannot zoom to exit it so you have to re open field service from the menu which is very slow loading.

77,Average user,"April 23, 2020",5,Amazing! I can’t imagine running my business without this app I wake up to it and look at my dashboards before reading the news or kissing my wife! Chatter contextualizes conversation and helps keep everyone aware of changes and ideas. Love this app!
78,Reemusk,"October 14, 2019",1,"Intentionally Broken Reporting Feature Who had the genius idea to break summary reports in Salesforce for iOS? You guessed it, Salesforce! Imagine being a half-baked, brain dead app to the Store that loses to your instances mobile website. It’s a shame how SFDC continues to brag about new app innovations, but completely misses the mark on core features. It’s not surprising, at this point. It’s been broken for years. They are willingly avoiding fixing it. Sounds like internal department conflict leaves them in a quagmire, and we are the victims."

80,Yalebulldog8,"July 31, 2017",5,Salesforce1 I have enjoyed the ability to function as if I'm at my computer but not have to be tethered to my office. It allows all of the same functionality as my computer which is very helpful.
81,Scarby92,"October 29, 2017",5,Salesforce needs more customer reviews I have been using Salesforce since January 1st 2017 and this is the first time I was asked to fill out a review for the Salesforce App. It is great but I wish the app was more intuitive. Our system would be amazing if it was more visually pleasing!
82,sm91006,"January 15, 2018",4,Ability to manage users using iPhone I am a system administrator and I would be able to create new users and Assign them to roles and profiles using my phone which I am on able to do. it’s not easy to find it. this improvement might help
83,beccap2010,"February 20, 2018",3,Slow Loading The app is incredibly slow to load and sometimes won’t load if you don’t have incredibly strong service available. Also the task editing button is difficult to get to. Otherwise I like the way it’s organized and is convenient when I’m in the field
84,Weather is coo,"July 25, 2019",5,"Natural extension of desktop, optimized for mobile This thing flies. It lets me continuing working inside my org no matter where I am. Workflow is incredibly smooth, and let’s me take actions as they come up instead of waiting to get back on the laptop."
85,MarkMPT,"July 5, 2019",3,"Helpful, but not great I love having the ability to access all of the information on my accounts....when it’s actually working. The problem with this app is that too often it just doesn’t work properly. Many times I will search for something and just get a blank page."
86,Marks1mpson,"April 11, 2020",5,Works for simple lookups If you need to simply lookup a customer or contact this works well. I would love to be able to (1) Mark specific reports as favorites (2) make reports mobile friendly and (3) see favorite reports in the app
87,Goblue3313,"October 31, 2019",5,The leader for a reason Salesforce is the leading CRM for a reason. They make data management easy. The fact that I can check if my company does business with a particular entity and update colleagues with changes is pretty awesome. This app is easy and fun to use.
88,Mr. Wish it Worked,"July 16, 2019",1,"Never ending glitches I have to delete and reinstall weekly. The app works fine for a few days then gets stuck on my recent activity. No matter what I click it takes me back to the same page. From that page I search an account, click that account but instead of taking me there it takes me right back to recent activity. The only thing that stops this is to delete and reinstall."
89,jcr8552,"November 19, 2019",3,"Interface Very hard to see opportunities once they have been created, as it seems the font is too large for the screen and you have to open each one individually. There is no ability to do a quick easy scan to find what you are looking for."
90,SF Seabrook,"August 18, 2017",5,How do people live without this?! This app delivers everything I need to run my business. No great salesperson is tied to her desk and this gives me the ability to be in front of customers and with my team without ever skipping a beat.
91,VP of Sales,"December 5, 2017",5,Functionality and ease of use The app does not provide the exact same functionality as the desktop version and an overlay like the Clari App makes it much easier to navigate and use.
92,Lets talk about Apps,"December 14, 2017",2,"Fake reviews Any and all reviews over 3 stars I am assuming are fake. Either my employer is using this app incorrectly (and that may be the problem) or this app just isn't what it could be. It's slow, it's not user friendly, and it lacks pertinent information. I would have designed the app to work on the fly, and be customizable by the user. "
93,daisycowboy,"January 8, 2018",4,Bridging gaps Salesforce has not only put many concepts into play but has streamline this in a way where it’s realistic to not need support staff. What’s the system integrates it’s third-party apps more fluidly the system or one just like it will be at the cornerstone of every office from corporate to personal I believe.
94,Mark Grgurich,"February 6, 2018",5,Everything is where I need it Salesforce is the answer to my prayers. The new Lightning version help me stay organized and working the priorities. Thank you for making your tools better for all of us.
95,#yep,"July 24, 2018",5,It’s a keeper The Salesforce app is wonderful. So easy to use and makes entering information timely easier.  I use the desk top version for updating addresses and targeting but for day to day events nothing beats logging my sales activities as I go.
96,Emojian111111,"July 30, 2018",5,"Great Mobile Experience CRM tends to be like healthcare, or ISPs, at least in the USofA - you get what you get. Salesforce is great, much better than the competition. I really like how I can do things on the app like I could on the computer, but faster! Great mobile UI"
97,clemdan,"July 31, 2018",2,"Phone semi overheating, frozen screen Unfortunately, the app isn’t working properly. I simply wanted to view my pto and absences and when I clicked on that option the menu will not go away and none of the functions will work. The screen is frozen within the app. I can exit out of it by clicking my home button easily but I cannot do anything within the app."
98,wnydcar,"February 15, 2019",5,"SF can do anything... The flexibility of Salesforce has been the key to the growth of our company. Anything I have needed the system to do, with premier support’s help, we’ve been able to make customizations and adapt with as our company grows."
99,Jon3NT,"March 27, 2020",1,"This app is terrible!! Please Salesforce, if you’re listening, no app in 2020 should be this bad, this unpolished, this glitchy. Please, please, please just make it better lol. I know you can, I know it’s possible, and I’m sure it’s not in your priority list since most people use the desktop version and you’ve already got your money from your users. Buy just please, make it better. I really enjoy using the desktop version, but this app is so, so bad 😫"
100,B2Hillseth,"July 25, 2017",5,"Benefits of Salesforce1 I love its versatility and intuitiveness on the computer, iPad, and the phone. The support that they've been able to provide to provide better clarification, create reports, etc has also been really helpful."
101,Shoemana,"October 19, 2017",5,Excellent Salesforce is an excellent way to document my appointments and stops with my customers. The only improvement I have is more places for additional contacts at each account.
102,cotogolf,"March 31, 2018",5,Best program ever I have been an ACT user for over two decades and then I switch to Salesforce about three years ago and my profit ability has jumped up dramatically. I will never switch back.
103,kaehladae,"July 16, 2018",5,Love this convenient way of keeping up with my customer service Awesome and easy to use. Very beneficial to me and my part time status. Recommend every associate having this on there smart phone
104,mel1ora,"September 28, 2018",5,So far great! I’m finding this version of Salesforce very easy to use.  So far all I’ve done is capture lead information but it’s allowing me to “brain dump” into one simple platform. Looking forward to having it help me prosper!
105,castrocn,"February 6, 2019",5,Suggestion only The only thing I wish salesforce did was put is little red dot to remInd us of non sales apts and appointments kinda like a message on our apps on our phones just a reminder red dot on salesforce
106,AJ6797,"February 6, 2019",5,"Intuitive and easy to use Great to have full access to do all important tasks like creating accounts, opps, contacts and quotes while on the road and working from my cellphone."
107,Michelleyyyyyyyyy,"May 7, 2019",1,"So frustrating I use Salesforce on my computer basically all day, but when I have to use it on my phone it is useless. When I search an account, a lot of the information is missing. Or it will show up then disappear before I can tap it. This is especially true for the activity history. Even when it doesn’t disappear, I tap it and it’ll say I don’t have permission to view it. So frustrating!!"
108,jeff.kemp,"April 15, 2020",2,"Not great Just tried this app for first time and already don’t like it. Wanted to see opportunity pipeline but was not able to apply any meaningful filters. Filter is limited to ‘equals’ and with no option for ’OR’ within conditions, and not able to add more than one option from picklist of same field. "
109,tkocpo,"August 30, 2019",5,Team leader Tom Olinghouse Downloading takes way too long. A lot of my team is having a hard time logging in this is the first time I’ve gotten this far myself with two days of train.
110,kdkelly,"September 11, 2017",4,"Good product Much better today than when I last used Remedy many years ago. Most everything I need is right where I can easily find it and ticket entry is easier, especially when using templates."
111,Alice Atlanta,"September 26, 2017",5,My mobile office SalesForce1 makes writing a sale in a center faster and easy to add changes to a center's information
112,Goyo1973,"November 26, 2017",1,"Multiple photos, videos and better functionality I like Salesforce however it would be great if there there was a way to upload videos instead of a link.  Also it would be great to be able to upload multiple photos in one post vs having to post 1 per each photo.  "
113,Trust me I'm mormon,"March 17, 2018",3,Sometimes works Most of the time the app works now but every once in a while there’s some bugs and it has to be reset. Sales force is pretty prompt with fixing problems though as long as they get a report. Hoping for a nice polished app experience in a couple more months.
114,THEREALKONK,"April 10, 2018",5,Money maker I often joke that I’m not the amazing salesperson I’ve received kudos for so often- rather I’m skilled at timing. Salesforce makes “right place right time” a far more loaded deck and it’s SO easy to use. Do yourself a favor and use it!
115,Andonon,"August 10, 2018",5,I live by this app as an admin. I’m a certified Salesforce Admin. I live by this app. I love it. I get access to everything gnu need to work cases right from my phone. I can’t make many system changes. But collaborating is awesome. Note. I also use the SalesforceA app.
116,CJ GJ,"November 6, 2018",1,The rating is misleading I feel like it must be the gajillion salesforce employees who rated this app 5 stars because it is quite sad and awfully cumbersome. The UI is terrible- it would be much better if the layout were more like the desktop site. It’s slow to load as you scroll up and virtually no way to even customize the view. Please throw this out and start over because I WOULD rate Salesforce as a whole a 5. Not this travesty.
117,Dusty Mc,"April 8, 2019",4,Information I would like to see the customers past purchasing history along with what we charged for each product under their account.
118,MBW70,"August 9, 2019",5,App so much easier to use than desktop! The SF phone app is 100% easier to navigate and get things document quickly than the desktop version!
119,JonnyHuse,"July 11, 2019",3,"Works great when no bugs I have been experiencing many issues since the recent update on my iPhone. iPhone is updated on software, same with SF app. Been an issue for about a week now. Cannot load suspect details to log calls on the go....please fix ASAP! This tool is my mobile office & assistant"
120,Anmol Bhasin,"August 31, 2017",5,Ok with issues.. Counter intuitive design.. crashes intermittently. Deep linking from the browser is very clunky. This has been solved over and over I hope Salesforce App can pick the mechanism from a consumer app.
121,olu_chitown,"June 20, 2018",5,"Love the mobile feature Helps me manage my work load on the go, whenever, wherever. Also further aids cross-team collaboration within my organization. #TeamTech"
122,ban_cars,"June 29, 2018",1,"Completely nonfunctional after the update I can’t open any Objects - a blue bar runs indefinitely across the top of the screen whenever I search and select, or select from Chatter - and since I’m running 11.4 (the recommended iOS) on an iPhone X, I think it’s safe to say that the app is just broken. The majority of my work is in the field so it would be massively helpful if Salesforce could fix this very soon."
123,austinmarshall42,"September 11, 2018",5,"Huge Improvement Much easier to you, visibility into account details and navigation are huge improvements."
124,walkerworker,"March 25, 2019",3,My Neighborhood / what I would like. *After each entry it does not return to the previous screen.
125,Mollyperez,"April 11, 2019",1,Annoying Every time I try to open the app to validate my day of work it freezes and I have to close the app completely and reload.  I often have to do this multiple times before the page actually loads properly.  Also the fact that I don’t have all of the key features as on the website is very annoying.  Why can’t I add or edit days easily on the app?
126,Mike K,"August 8, 2019",4,I bet this is awesome if you could log in I've checked my PW and user name. Changed my password. Nothing. It's completely useless to me. I'd love if someone would reach out and tell me another way to log in since using the correct user /PW doesn't work
127,Redness13,"July 16, 2019",1,Not a fan of sales force lighting The old sales force was much easier to use and much faster and efficient you could see all of the you needed to see in a glance now there’s 12 different buttons that you have to press to see the information that you need on the fly and the pages take their time to load it’s just not a step in the right direction in my opinion.
128,budmannray,"June 25, 2019",5,Not working App constantly crashes and has to be reset...currently unable for check calendar..which is only reason I use the app.  Works on the iPad but not 7plus.
129,Shambonianator,"October 29, 2019",5,Passin tickets off to other salesforce users Great app. Wish you could assign tickets to other users in the mobile version though. Other than that I love it!
