0,Wahahahe,"May 15, 2019",4,"Almost there I like that this app is simple. Like other “CBT” apps, this app seems to be based on Albert Ellis’ REBT. However, it is missing a couple steps of REBT. For one, under Automatic Thought, it asks, “what is going on?” These are two different questions/steps in REBT. The last two queries—Challenge and Alternative Thought—are essentially the same step; i.e. “Disputation”. REBT asks the following questions;  “what is going on” (Activating event), then “automatic thoughts” (Beliefs) then what you are “feeling” (Consequences), then “cognitive distortions” and “disputation” (Disputation), then “new feelings” (Effects). These are the ABCDE steps of Albert Ellis’ REBT or CBT."

It’s like when you complain to a friend and they try to reason with you in an attempt to make you feel better and now you have this new perspective to think about. With Quirk you’re able to easily record the interaction and you’re forced to come up with a new perspective all on your own."

3,bluesky11111111,"October 14, 2019",5,"Way of life We tend to know what to do logically, but hard to enforce. Quirk makes it easy to record thoughts (good of bad), and help alter mindset long term. Quirk was particularly effective during a period of stress / uncertainty, I continue to use the app even when the need is less great, trust that long term its an investment in my own health + productivity, and general ability to appreciate life."
4,lllaaaahhhh>>><<<,"August 5, 2019",5,Thank you Thank you for this. This is basically a great app in this day and age that uses David burns’ three column method in his book “feeling good”. I’m so glad this app exists makes the process so much easier on your phone. No need to memorize the 10 distortions. Easy to navigate. I love this app. Thank you so much.
5,emily.a.t,"November 24, 2019",5,"Long time user I’ve been a early user of quirk. I would absolutely pay for the service. It has helped me through some of the most difficult times of my life, and I am better because of it"
6,O Johnston,"February 17, 2020",5,A Joy to Use I really enjoy using this app and it has really helped my mental health. It’s simple and unbloated and free of ads. I tried a whole bunch of CBT apps and this is the only one I could find that isn’t complete garbage. Thank you for making this app!
7,prateekswain,"October 12, 2019",5,Quirk has changed my life I had an extremely high stress situation this summer and Quirk literally got me through my darkest times. It’s the perfect app and I honestly believe everyone should have it on their phone!
8,teybug,"July 16, 2019",5,Perfect to use with therapy This therapy app is amazing combined with going to my normal sessions. I just started using it but this is 100x more useful than pen and paper. I deal with a lot of anxiety and stress and CBT is the only thing that helps.
9,Jasen Lew,"October 12, 2019",5,"Recommend trying out! Great design, simple and easy-to-use.  Recommend trying and the Quirk team is super friendly."
10,Nimbuzz user,"April 28, 2019",5,"Great design, easy to use Easy to use and very nice UI. Makes it easier to categorize thoughts. The intro is informative and emojis make it fun!"
11,Munkee x,"November 21, 2019",1,You can’t even look at it. This app opens immediately to the try and buy page. You can’t even look at it first. There isn’t even one free thing on it. It’s forcing you to agree to the free days before a subscription starts. That’s shady to me. What so secretive that I can’t even look around at what it has to offer first? I’ll pass.
12,YBKC197,"July 27, 2019",5,Great tool! It’s a great way to really process thoughts and actions to calm my own mind. Would definitely recommend to others.
13,Appmasta,"October 2, 2019",1,"Wish I could try I signed up and messed around with the app for a few minutes. Next time I opened it up I was forced to do a 7 day trial, with no way to skip. Yes, I could cancel after 7 days, but still I have to authenticate with Apple and then manually cancel within a week if I don’t like it. Very bad experience."
14,Papp GIGO,"June 14, 2019",5,"Soooo helpful I’ve been struggling with a ton of anxiety and have tried everything, meditation, therapists. Doing CBT with Quirk is literally the only thing that helps me."
15,FA1LURE,"August 14, 2019",5,Update. Evan the dev reached out to fix my issues with a previous purchase of the app and got me all squared away. Thank you! Great app!
16,Sean -,"July 28, 2019",5,Works well Good application of CBT. 
17,nth.gol,"June 20, 2019",5,"Super catchy Cute app, and I love the memorable “bad thought” types. I can see myself using this for a long time"
18,DEMON_COP,"February 14, 2020",1,"No support Developer said he was working on this app full time, then stopped updating it. Most support tickets for this app get closed by a bot after lack of activity and tagged with “won’t fix.” This app is broken, dead, and not worth a subscription at this point."
19,Foom foom,"November 3, 2019",5,Really works !! This app is simple and effective. A big thanks to the developers !!!
20,RawaMS,"December 29, 2018",2,"Needs a lot of work I bought this app because I saw it on Product Hunt, and I was excited to give it a try because I’ve been using CBT this month to try to get past my recurring depression. I was disappointed to find that it doesn’t seem to be complete and needs some work. My first frustration was the fact that for some reason, double tapping on the spacebar does not create a period as in most other apps with writing. My second was that the “Save” button did not give any indication that the thought was saved, and I tapped on it twice with no change, only to go back to the main page to find my thought there twice. Then I went to go delete the duplicate and found that I couldn’t. These are all parts of the basic functionality of the app. I would give it one star, but I gave it two because I think it’s a great idea and the UI is clean... but it needs a lot of work and I will be patiently waiting and excited to see some updates from the developer."
21,Kaizom,"July 26, 2019",5,"A Quirky Hero Quirk has helped me manage my meltdowns so much. What were debilitating, heart-wrenching panic attacks are now mild flutters. Thank you so much!"
22,neilbeijing,"October 13, 2019",5,Couldn’t be better Engaging and helpful
23,InEDIfromUS,"August 25, 2019",5,"Recommending this to everyone I know There is not a soul in the world that wouldn’t benefit from this exercise. This convenient distillation of one of the central maintenance exercises of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), otherwise known to many as “stuff your shrink will recommend that you do but you never do”, is such an efficient and effective way to meaningfully feel better soon. You have your own driftwood of thoughts on the shores of your head. Get them out quickly, write out the worst of your internal critic, and then analyze it by identifying the distortions of the critic. Then, re-write the thought by removing the distortion. Sounds simple enough to do in your head, but the magic happens when you physically type/write out/speak out the un-distorted statement. It’s like the squats of a good gym routine. Effective, and best when done consistently over time and with repetitions. You wouldn’t just imagine doing squats to get results at the gym, would you? You don’t just imagine healthy eating and a workout; you eat the spinach, you do squats with sets of 20 reps and you do it diligently to get your strongest version of yourself. I highly recommend this, it’s got informative little blurbs that nudge you to do your squats- er I mean- thought exercises and it’s cute and handy and isn’t a book with an obvious self help title you have to cover up to carry around to avoid pitiful or overly curious glances on the train to work or bus to school or when you’re sitting at your desk coping with work you should probably delegate, or at home with your parents who don’t really understand your college degree or choice of occupation and you need a little less self doubt to open up and tell them that you’re really happy with your choices. Anyway, whatever it is, I promise this will help."
24,MA8888!,"October 13, 2019",5,Highly helpful Excellent tool
25,jen598d,"September 16, 2019",1,App issues I can’t even start using the app because the button to start exercised hidden at the bottom of screen.
26,Messyjones,"August 11, 2019",5,Great app Best app ever! Amazing amazing! You should download this!!!
27,SD16570109,"October 9, 2019",1,They make it look free. Don’t fall for it. As soon as you’re done with the tour it tries to charge you to use the app.
28,ninedifferentways,"August 1, 2019",1,Won’t open Tapped and swiped the intro screen and nothing makes it open.
29,dave555@,"January 28, 2020",1,"Unusable No navigation, can’t unsubscribe."
30,@Magnuson,"December 29, 2018",1,"Zero supporting information In order to use this app, you have to already know what cognitive behavioral therapy is. The app does not explain how to use the app or engage with each of the fields it provides. For example, under the ‘Cognitive Distortion’ field are a bunch of different options such as “All or Nothing Thinking”, “Catastrophizing”, and “Emotional Reasoning”, but none of these options are explained anywhere. I have never engaged with CBT and now I feel like I am required to go read a book on the subject before I am able to use this app."
31,ZCTechnoDino,"December 31, 2018",5,Restarted = Updated App Very impressive app that works to identify and validate how one is thinking and record that data for the future. Includes many terms and phrases that should resonate with those that have some familiarity with CBT. 
32,Fart Enjoyer1,"December 31, 2018",4,"Potential I’d love to see this app take off. There is a good foundation and as it is, it provides an opportunity to be mindful about what you are feeling and to think through alternative ways to interpret those feelings. I could see myself using this app on a regular basis. As with any app, it needs more development to reach its potential. My recommendations are to give the opportunity to delete entries and to make it more clear that an entry has been saved (maybe refresh the page)."
