0,PMEinDenver,"April 24, 2019",4,"Inspiring but one big minus I started using Wix a month ago.  Within a few days of playing with it I upgraded so I could have my own domain name and more features, and access to images, etc.  Wix is very user friendly both on your computer and the app allows you to do a lot too while keeping an uncluttered look.  (Perhaps most amazing is the AI assistant you use on your computer—after doing a short questionnaire about you needs and wants, it whips up a website for you.  Frankly I was amazed at what it came up with for me, beautifully designed.  You can then do a lot of customization.  The more customization you do, the more learning curve.  But I’ve been so inspired, I’ve been playing with it a lot.  I downloaded the app;  it too is to super easy to use with attractive design.  Thanks for the blog manager!  BUT...here’s the thing: I went to use the app on my iPad Pro and, well, there is no app for the iPad Pro!  I was stunned and disappointed.  It’s not like the Pro came out yesterday.  The Pro would make the perfect work space for Wix—more design features would be possible than with phone app.  You could then have pretty full featured Wix app on the go.  Please tell me an iPad Pro app will soon be available?!"
1,JaeAmor,"April 13, 2019",1,"Subscriber Engagement I have two sites with Wix. With the older one, I am able to reply directly to comments. But with the newer version, I can not. I just want to know who thought it was a great idea to take away the joy of no longer being able to engage with people who are subscribed to your site. Literally, what is the point of having a website where engagement and discussions are encouraged but you can’t even address each person as individuals. I’m incredibly upset and disappointed. With the money I’ve spent to build these sites, it’s heartbreaking to think that you no longer find it important to give people a voice on a website they pay just to be able to have that platform to interact with others. It’s a waste of time, money, and effort if all people can do is look and scroll but can’t even reply back to one another. Never thought I would have regrets with this site but I certainly do now. Not sure who the creative mind was behind it but they certainly didn’t consider the things people loved and made them want to go with Wix to begin with. Why over complicate? Are we not tired of experiencing this feeling. Simplicity is bliss. Now we’re just lost. Whoever the team was before, bring them back. Either make it better or leave it as is."
2,c.ann.g.,"December 18, 2019",2,"Nobody Will Respond To My Questions So at first I loved the app. It was simple to use. I answered all of the surveys with thoughtful insights. I started earning cash and even started getting value surveys, which pay a little more than the regular ones. I haven’t won any of the big payments but I was fine with working my way up. Well I finally hit a little over $10, which is the minimum to cash out but it’s been almost a week and I still haven’t received my payment. So I tried emailing this company over and over again but nobody will respond and I have no idea how to get a hold of customer service. It took a lot of time and effort on my end to get up to $10 doing little $.15-.$25 surveys and would like to get my cash especially since I’m unemployed at the moment and Christmas is about to arrive. This app would be great and I would totally recommend it if they would be available to assist the people who took the time to complete their surveys. Don’t download this app if you are not okay with wasting your time. I use several other apps to make a little cash until I find a job and I always received payment within two to three days in my PayPal account. I’m highly disappointed!"
3,Anointed Touch Beauty Salon,"March 20, 2019",2,"Bookings I use Wix for my salon booking appointments. I recently got a suggestion from Wix suggesting that my clients download the app. Now before when my clients would book online I could see everything their name,number, an email an services that they were booking for. Now when they book with the app it doesn’t have the clients name or number. Just the service their getting an email. In the booking part it only shows service. I don’t even see or know who I am servicing. So I don’t know who I’m about to give service too. Although emails are fine I mostly contact my clients by phone. I will not be suggesting for my clients to use the app until it gives me more information on my end about the clients an their appointment. As for now I will continue to lead my clients to the website to book their appointments. Also I had only one conflict where my client scheduled an appointment it gave me the wrong time that she scheduled for. It was an whole hour difference. Her appointment was at 3:30 pm an her confirmation told her the same. But on my notification calendar it said 4:30 pm . I hope this doesn’t happen again. It was an inconvenience for us both to have different times."
4,rare form beauty,"April 5, 2019",3,"Y’all have poor communication, and the app needs to be fixed! When I first started using this app I really like it, now it’s becoming a annoyance and inconvenience with the problems that come with it. I blocked out last month when I needed a break for working and it would not let me unblock so I couldn’t use the app, I even emailed and received a response saying someone will get back to me but no one did. I just had to wait until my block was over for my clients to schedule. It is now a month later I’m trying to block off a certain time and it’s practically doing the same thing but this time I need a special time blocked every week and it’s not even acknowledging it. It’s still showing my entire schedule is available even when I uncheck the Wednesday box that whole day is still available to book. Another thing is when my client go to styles the pic is cut off it would be great if I continue to keep the app if you could show the full picture that would be great. Other than that i haven’t had problems but those are major problems and could affect my client relationship."
5,Greg15648,"September 24, 2018",2,"What happened to this app? I’ve been using Wix for 5 years now. The app has been incredibly helpful in managing my therapy private practice. I was able to easily see my bookings calendar and schedule appointments for my clients. After the new update, it is incredibly difficult to find my bookings calendar. One page title “my bookings” says that I have no appointments, and then redirects me to another page that shows how many appointments I actually have for the week. It used to be very easy to see my calendar - one click and I’m there. Now I have to click through pages and pages to find my appointments. I don’t know why that changed! Another problem I have with the app is that it constantly gets stuck showing all of my notifications. The app will say I have three notifications, so I’m thinking I have three appointments. I click into the app and go from page to page to find nothing. I mark all of my alerts as “read” and close out of the app - it still says I have three notifications. "
6,I looked and I just loved it,"April 17, 2020",3,"Loving the potential but... I have been testing and exploring using the one mobile/Wix app for months. When I first started I didn’t roll it out because there wasn’t the capability to monitor who joins our community and how. Now there is and when COVID hit, I thought, the app is a perfect solution for our growing community of 1300+. But I’ve not been able to launch because for over two weeks now, we have not been able to get the “groups” feature to work—it doesn’t show up on member pages for some odd reason and WIX hasn’t been able to resolve things. It’s been extremely frustrating. They are seemingly elevating the issue now but it took a good 1 1/2 weeks for me to not have to re-explain the issue all over, provide all of the same information, etc with new people each time. Yet still, I don’t have any answers or a solution and we are in our third week! Has anyone else run into issues with “groups?” I’d rather Wix remove the option of having them if they can’t get them to work altogether."
7,KBos822,"April 20, 2018",2,"Mobile view lacking I find it completely absurd that after all this time, we still can’t customize the mobile view. 75%+ of my visitors are using mobile devices and they need to scroll down pages and pages of full size photos to see what they want. Would it be so difficult to just give us two columns?! A grid to make viewing easier?! I’m sure I’m losing sales this way as the average visitor will lose patience. Also, they click on a product and see the title in humongous letters and a teeny tiny product photo. Can’t edit that either."
8,spil@,"September 19, 2019",2,Little functionality and a lot of bugs App still not blog friendly. Cannot manipulate photos with the blog or access photos that have already been uploaded. 
9,briski71,"April 5, 2019",5,"AMAZING I don’t even know where to begin. I made my business and I can’t believe how easy it was. This is the best website maker EVER!!! It has a lot of features and templates. Did I mention a lot of them are FREE!!!!!!!?? Definitely get this app if you have a business that you are starting and needs a website. I love all of the product options. I can put what sizes you can chose from when you are getting a product and you can put the colors of the product that you can chose from. It also comes with pictures to design your website with. Even though not all of the pictures are free, I still find it really cool. When I was making my website, it was really fun! I really want to pay for the Memberships, but I don’t have the money. This app I would recommend. 5/5 stars."
10,SAHM I am,"September 15, 2018",2,"Unhappy with update I love wix for our websites - so easy to build beautiful websites. And the previous app version, while limited in capabilities, was very simple to navigate and intuitive. However, this new version - while it clearly has expanded capabilities (the reason I have two stars instead of one) - it falls short on the basics. I see a badge that I have a new notification and two things have happened on separate occasions: 1. I have a new message from my website contact form that I cannot access, because although I can see a preview of the first line in my notifications list, tapping on it won’t open it, or 2. I have no idea what the notification is about, because once I’ve opened the app, and discovered there’s no new message, I don’t know where else to look for any new information. "
11,jmadden0723,"September 15, 2018",5,Invoicing I really only have one complaint about the app!! I can’t send an invoice to my customer. Example- I post my product on social media with the instructions to comment their email address to be sent an invoice for products. Then I have to dry out my lap top go to the main site create an invoice and then on top of that it doesn’t take the products out of my inventory. So then I have to go into my inventory and edited it manually. It would be better if you could create an invoice from the app and be able to select the products that are being sold and have that take them out of my inventory!!! If you could add this function it would really be helpful. I am on my phone more than I am my laptop. 
12,Goddessphere,"September 23, 2018",5,"Amazing and Always Innovative! I absolutely love Wix. I enjoy maneuvering though the site... The ability to edit easily, the options offered, as well as the fundamental straightforwardness the site offers. I ENJOY this compared to the many other sites out there. Now I have the functionality through my phone..?!?!?!! GREAT! This is the reason I ONLY prefer wix. Seriously, I have been able to create beautiful sites, editing has been easy and exciting... Wix is VERY INNOVATIVE! I enjoy all this site and the team behind this amazing site. You are always allowing us to grow with you by offering ways we can grow. I encourage all to use Wix bcz they are innovative and amazing. Always providing new ways for customers like me to improve the way we present ourselves."
13,TMV76,"October 16, 2018",1,Not really sure where my site went. I’m gonna have to agree with many others; the site is harder now to navigate.  Not sure what happened to the ability to edit and port in the main site blog.  I have been looking for about 30 minutes before I gave up and decided to see if you had posted info about it.  All I see is a social part which makes no difference to me since it is just a portfolio site at the moment.  Before I could edit my site but it seems I can only edit the test part of the site that is a book club I made just to see what it was like.  I have no ability to delete it from the app.  I don’t even know how anyone would ever find it on my site anyway.  It’s really just supposed to be a place to write snippets of writings for the blog and writings for the main portfolio but I cannot edit either of these now.  Very confused and disappointed.  
14,Ermahorn,"January 13, 2019",5,"So far so good Wix was relatively easy....but very time consuming. I was able to get my site up in just 2 days (about 4 hours the 1st day and maybe 6 hours the 2nd day) part of that time was spent creating the privacy policy and my first Facebook business page and 1st FB ad that people can click and be directed to my Wix page. I just want customer service to be here for me when I hit road  blocks....as I tried building a page with a different company, with Ipage years ago, then I had to buy a domain on godaddy, then I had to get a business email with Gmail.....sooo convoluted. Wix allows customers to send me emails, allows bookings, perfect for my business. Only one complaint, the hone page contact form doesn’t have a spot for a customer to input their phone number."
15,kdot2789,"March 6, 2019",2,"What’s going on?? We’ve been using Wix for a while, and it’s been very inconsistent. Most recently it’s stopped notifying us through emails that we are receiving bookings. The only way I saw that we were booked yesterday is that I just happened to check the app when I used it to book an appointment. I’ve been missing messages from my clients, and the therapists I have working with us are no longer getting these notifications through email. It’s very important that we receive these bc the app does not send them to my therapist when I book it through the app or from my desk top. So now I’m calling or texting my employees every time I find a booking. I’m exhausted from trying to get a call back because they never call me when I request it. So this review is my last attempt at getting help. Small businesses like ours don’t have time to be glued to a computer all day hoping for a real human to finally respond to them."
16,KLo1247,"October 24, 2019",5,"Real time tracking I’m usually a little hesitant with some apps because they aren’t worth the time.  However, I decided to go ahead with this app since I have all the other things connected under the premium account. I had just downloaded the app, logged in and on the computer side was doing some back end adjustments when a notification popped up that someone was on my site, what page, and for how long. OMGoodness. Blown away! I said to myself, “ain’t no way..” so me being me, published my background edits and went on the site live and BOOM! Notification pops up on que. Haven’t even explored the entire app yet but I’m excited for now and the improvements that will come for this app. Wix have continued to improve year after year. Keep it up!"
17,Theee Best App Ever!,"January 19, 2020",2,"The newest update and other features I don’t know why things were changed but on the newest update, it took away some of the chat features and it’s a little disappointing. I was able to see when a customer came on my site, the. I was able to click on the comment chat bubble to see their city and what page were they visiting on the site for analytic purposes.  But after the newest update, it doesn’t show up and when I click on the chat feature, it doesn’t show the customer.  And this was a big thing for my business before this newest update.  "
18,DeeDeeDee66,"January 22, 2020",4,"non functional.... lots of glitches for a SALON I am a Salon owner. Small salon. I love that this app is free with my website, but sometimes it doesn't work for my clients. Every week I get a message saying “it wont let me book” “it wont let me reschedule/cancel”  Sometimes it tells people that I dont have any availability.  And on my end as the owner, I cannot override anything in the wix app.... I have to go to my laptop to make changes.  The other issue with this app is if I block or unblock time off from the app, it will not save my changes . "
19,Polo.T,"April 14, 2020",2,"Needs more mobile friendly editing tools I’ve been enjoying all that comes with having a wiz website, for sure. But the app does nothing more for me than have a chat room to talk to clients who message the chat box on my website. All the other tools they advertise are cumbersome and I don’t use them/know how to use them. I don’t have a blog for my business so it’s useless. I’d much rather like to be able to edit and control my website in it’s entirety like I can from a desktop. Email marketing/editing, editing my site, and everything else. The least used tool is the blog. And since I’m moving away from desktop to an iPad Pro, it would be much appreciated if I can have full function and full reign over my wiz website editing and tools on an iPad OS interface. Even in safari I can’t edit text or delete boxes in the email campaign."
20,inkalay on,"July 14, 2018",3,Customer support. I’ve been with WIX for a couple of years and am now considering switching to another host because of WIX current customer support. When I first joined it was very easy to contact someone for help on making adjustments to my website. Now they require you to submit a ticket and it’s not 24/7. It’s also hard to get to the page of even submitting a ticket. For me this is a big deal bc I like to be able to communicate clearly and efficiently and quickly. Chatting and email takes forever to resolve. My schedule is very inconsistent so I need someone there when I’m ready. 
21,Apple Boats,"July 22, 2018",2,"Lacks options I am extremely disappointed in just how hard it is to customize my website. The app might as well not even exist because my site never loads for me to even try to edit it. I don’t like that I can’t change the colors of the templates to suit my brand’s color theme. Or, that you can’t switch things around within the layout to be where you want them, only change the layout to options that don’t really look all that great. I don’t know if it’s just because it’s on mobile, but it kind of defeats the purpose of having the app at your fingertips to be able to edit your site and still not be able to edit your site the way you need to. It’s sad to say but I left Wix because I thought the old set up was kind to work with but this is way worse, at least when I published my site before it was how I wanted it."
22,Heathfeath718,"January 25, 2019",1,"Not great for analytics I love the analytics on the wix website. We track visitors from all over the world for bookings (musician website). The site on the browser is fairly accurate. But what the heck with this app???? I like that it gives me notifications when someone is on the site, but 50% of the time the location is wrong and doesn’t match the analytics on the site. Then, if you log onto the app, there is no where can you find a list of visitors. The only way I can see what page someone is on is if I happen to catch them online and open the app from the notification. Still can’t track the pages they went to, but if I’m lucky I can catch their current page. No list of daily visitors. Disappointed, because we use analytics daily for info into who is tracking emails, where requests are coming from etc. if you’d fix this and model it after your website that’d be amazing."
23,Kik: itsj4yleen,"January 28, 2019",3,"Could be better. I understand that there are limitations on a mobile app that there aren’t when on a desktop, but my goodness. I can’t type a blog post on my phone before it stops scrolling and going back to the top. Sometimes, an idea comes to you when you’re away from a computer and you want to get it all out then. You’d think with the app you would be able to, but you can’t see anything you write past maybe one paragraph. I gave the app three stars because I could check my inbox and blog normally, but as for creating content, if you’re away from a computer jot whatever you have to say down in your notes and wait until you reach a computer because it’s"
24,Thefreckledfacepr,"February 7, 2019",1,Disgusted!! And shocked! So I’m over had not too long ago deleted the secondary wiz app where You can manage your platforms/but I went to download it again as I wanted to update photos etc and low and behold I download this imposter of an app!
25,Parisredd,"May 15, 2019",5,"Great site and intuitive to use. I love wix. They seem to have thought of everything. Just when I think I have a question they no one has possible thought of, I can google it and wix already figured it out. I really can say enough great things. Wix on mobile is great and thoughtful too! They include everything you need to do on the go like scan barcodes to send shipping confirmation emails, add a product, upload and edit pictures from your phone, get a sale in person... they’ve thought of everything really!  The only thing is I wish we were able to customize the subscriber login screen but that’s really the only thing."
26,Hannahk760,"February 25, 2020",2,"Used to work, not so much now I used to be able to work from this app quite well.  I had no issues of the app closing mid-listing and it uploaded all photos so well.  This worked so well for me, because I mostly work form my phone.  I’m not sure what happened but now my app shuts down right in the middle of a listing for my store, I have huge troubles downloading pictures, and it’s all very frustrating.  It’s the most frustrating because I do pay quite a lot to use Wix for web hosting my site, and I NEED to be able to work from my phone.   Can you got back to whatever was working before, because this is driving me crazy and making life harder, and sales lower because I don’t even list items in my shop anymore. I just use Etsy. If I am not using my website because it’s hard to list items, why am I even paying you guys?"
27,The Ms. Taboo,"August 23, 2019",4,"Wix App I love the Wix app, except for the MESSAGE feature. I can’t find where to turn it OFF on my mobile nor laptop on my website. I’ve called Wix to ask and was placed on hold for a ridiculous amount of time. When I have CHAT OFF, I don’t want messages to still go through my Wix app on my mobile (that defeats the purpose, to me). "
28,Facebook Fan2,"March 16, 2020",1,"WIX Advertises Their Brand Not Yours On App I would give the app in general a five star if it didn’t misrepresent. When you log into the app, WIX has its “own place” front and center already by default. "
29,zavamama3,"July 3, 2019",3,"Still won’t work..... I’ve been using Wix for about 3 months now. Loved it! It was fabulous! I upgraded to the premium so I could take advantage of all the bells and whistles.  Then, they placed an updated and now my wix is useless! My clients and I can no longer book appointments because the screen goes blank once you are on the calendar. It’s been like that for several weeks. I’m grateful that at least my current booked appointments haven’t disappeared however my clients are used to depending on this app for their scheduling needs. I’ve messaged feedback to the designers at least a dozen times with no prevail. I’m hoping this review reaches one of the designers for a fix really soon! Once it’s fixed I’d be happy to give them a 5 star."
30,saradubbb,"August 11, 2018",1,"Frustrating I use wix for my blog... and the mobile app is garbage. I’ve removed it from my phone a number of times after downloading because it’s nearly useless. After downloading this most recent time, I was rather impressed with the seemingly updated features. I decided to start a blog post within the app and it seems to have the same flawed feature as the website does at times. Once you get the page full of content: if it needs to expand, it doesn’t! You can scroll to the bottom only to be bumped back to the top as soon as you start typing, so there is no way to see the words. VERY FRUSTATING!!!!! Wix may be “free” for those of us who use the service as a hobby but it is becoming my least favorite. I won’t be using it once I decide to upgrade, that’s for sure."
31,heroCA,"October 5, 2018",1,"WIX APP and WIX Mobile Site I’m pretty sad and upset with the new WIX app.... it’s like a completely different app then before, not user friendly, I can’t find my products and orders as easily as before. Pretty much every single thing that what somewhat easily accessed through the WIX app before is just horrible now......"
32,andrewdsimpson,"October 8, 2018",2,"So many bugs...still. Getting better with each update, but still needs work. This app should be in beta! Seriously, do they even test these?! When I schedule an appointment in my booking calendar, no matter what address I put in for the location, it reverts it to an address that I used previously. So now I have 3 appointments with the wrong address. Thankfully, I’m smart enough to not use this as my main calendar. But the confirmation emails are showing the wrong address. It’s also frustrating that I can’t edit the address after it’s been scheduled. I have to cancel the appointment and create a new one. I’m also still having an issue with the notification badge showing I have notifications when I have nothing when I open the app. Please fix your app!"
33,"C3?@@""&","February 12, 2019",5,"Thanks! There was a bit of a learning curve with the new update.  I run a small business that operates by appointment.  I love that I can now book and edit appointments without having to input all of my client’s information and easily move appointments to different time slots or different days.  I’ve been patiently waiting for this update.  I’ve been a fan of wix for three years now and love the simplicity.  I am always getting clients who comment on how simple it is to book online.  It has definitely allowed me to focus on my work, not on the nitty gritty details like scheduling.  Keep up the good work!"
34,LeeMckeegan,"March 5, 2019",1,Do not use Wix if you need to accept payments! The app itself is useful for receiving customer chat notifications on your phone and being able to respond quickly. That’s about it. Everything else never loads and you can’t access anything. Also be wary of having your company’s site through wix in the first place of you need to use Wixpayments for processing. Customer service for Wixpayments is well below par. They also randomly deactivate your account for various reasons and find excuses to hold on to your money. When they do activate your account they will make your next transfer date weeks out instead of making an ach payment every Monday as their site states. Just long enough for them to randomly deactivate your account again and take 7 business days to get back to you. Total nightmare!
35,Lizchiq76,"May 27, 2019",3,"Constant problems I used Wix to design my store website and use the mobile app to actually run my business. When i first started using the App it was incredibly easy and useful, until they changed everything. I then had to adjust to the new app which was NOT user friendly at all. I've had too many problems to mention all of them, but the most unacceptable problem is not being able to open my store orders to see them!!!! It's been four days now and still not working! Im told they have to make a ""new version"" for IOS users and that will be fixed. They couldn't give me an estimate on when this will be available, so I guess Im SOL. Awful"
36,Ledd VG3,"June 3, 2019",4,"Wix App Thoughts: Everything is nice, the interface could use slight improvements & I don’t feel you should be forced to have a live chat inside the app if you don’t want it or if the site already provides it. A few months ago it was easier to access my Blog page and Add/Delete Blog Posts along with Editing them, nowadays it creates a whole entire new blog system in the app which doesn’t make sense since it isn’t a continuation off the one on my Wix Premium Website. Most importantly, it would be nice to incorporate a Mobile Editor so you can customize the actual website on the phone and not limited to it on a PC."
37,KaliDreamN,"September 17, 2019",2,"Would be great but a HUGE flaw I have run my business web site using Wix for years. A couple months ago my computer completely died and after a lot of thought and discussion with Apple on the best product for me I invested in the iPad Pro. I got it home to find out that Wix cannot be used on the iPad Pro and I lost a handful of clients due to not being able to update my site. Just days after finding this out I was also charged another $153 for use of the platform, an annual fee, for a site I can no longer use. Let’s just say I am now looking for a new platform to use that supports all devices. It’s 2019 and to not be supported on an iPad is a poor business decision that will eventually be costly as Apple further upgrades their products again this year."
38,Adjpaj,"November 5, 2019",3,Could be better I’ve been using this app since they kind of force it on you when you try to access the desktop site on a mobile device. It is convenient in a lot of ways but the fact that you can’t print an order form from the mobile app is ridiculous. I like to include copies of each order when I ship out packages and each time I have to log into the computer just to do it. In the age of air print and all. I hope there’s a fix. And customer service is horrendous. The hoops to jump through just to talk to a person only to be told at the end that support is unavailable and you should check back in 10 minutes...EVERYTIME!
39,Kitequeen,"November 12, 2019",1,Can’t edit your blog!! This app is useless when it comes to writing/editing your blog. I’m surprised that in this day and age I still have to tied to my desktop to post. It’s super frustration and I am deeply disappointed. 
40,tedbragg,"April 14, 2018",4,"Wix was garbage, now they’re amazing If you recall the Flash-based nightmare Wix from the early 2000s, you need to give them another try. Wix is NOTHING like its former self. My company’s website went from a Wordpress WooCommerce setup to Wix’s ecom and the results have been fantastic. We’re actually getting orders now. The inbound marketing, payment handling and shipping options are far and away better than what we had before, and much less of a headache. Wix isn’t for large ecom, but perfect for us. There’s a reason SEO service people love this platform and I’m kicking myself for not giving Wix another try sooner!"
41,MountainManXC,"June 25, 2018",1,"Works. Sometimes. Doesn’t actually save changes. We’ve about had it with this application. While it works great 90% of the time, we had a larger list of major issues but the list has been getting shorter as additional releases occur, so at least something is being done it seems. "
42,madig61,"October 1, 2018",1,"New update is HORRIBLE When I first downloaded this app it was ok, useful and had some features that I really liked. With the newest update, it is absolutely terribly. SO difficult to use, and half the features are just gone and replaced by random things that I’m sure no one ever uses. Not sure who thought this update would be a good idea, or why I’m the world it was changed this way, but I am very disappointed. "
43,Otaymah,"January 26, 2019",1,"This app is so glitchy!! I used to be able to post from my phone with no problems. Now, when I try to post all the pictures go to the top of the blog post. I can’t space them out in any way, nor can I even scroll to the bottom of the page. The cursor keeps going to the top of the page. I’ve tried deleting the app and installing it again, with no relief. It’s making me want to switch site providers. I’ve even spoken with tech support on numerous occasions and gotten absolutely no help. Now, after the update, the app is even worse! It’s really hard to find options, and the picture library doesn’t access your newest photos, so you can post easily. I am thinking of discontinuing my service with this company."
44,Em's iTunes Account,"March 8, 2019",1,iPad Pro compatibility I’m trying to set up my new business website.  Luckily I’ve given myself plenty of time for this.  
45,renee.terry,"April 12, 2019",2,"Search feature At this point, this app requires 3-4 updates a week, and yet they have still not added one of the most simple yet necessary features; a search bar. I am constantly on the go, so I communicate with my customers through the chat on the app. But when I need to refer to a conversation with a certain customer, I have to scroll through dozens of messages to find the one I need and usually missing the name while scrolling. This is a simple fix, just implement a search bar in the chat section so people can search customers names or keywords. I haven’t encountered an email or message system that doesn’t have this very basic feature. Why is this still a problem?"
46,imlafn,"December 16, 2019",1,"Please take my money I downloaded the app so I could check our account because I got email that our form of payment didn’t go through for renewal and it doesn’t appear that the mobile web browser version has that option. The first page of the app ONLY gives you the option to “Create your own presence” by signing up (not logging in) by Facebook, Google, or email, so I went ahead and entered my email, thinking it might realize it’s an existing user and prompt me to login. It did move me to the next page asking for a password, so I called up my keychain and chose the password corresponding to the email I’d used. Once chosen, the app took me right back to the first page of the app. Looks like I have to break out the ‘ol laptop to give you money, Wix."
47,TeeTee*,"May 2, 2020",1,Customer Support/Holding My Funds I have had two bad experiences with customer support. They have been giving me the run around with transferring my purchased funds to my bank account. I have about $200 being held up in Wix Payments and for no reason. This is my second year with Wix and none of my bank account information has changed. People are making purchases through my website and I have yet to receive my funds due to Wix holding them. I pay for their services with the same account that they are refusing to deposit my funds to. How can you NOT have a problem TAKING my money but have a problem placing my money into my account. I used to love working with Wix but now I’m beginning to think their a mistake to do business with.
48,Nickickk,"April 30, 2020",2,"⚠️ 3 Major Issues First, I have many apps on my phone and this is the only one that spams me promotional notifications. This app is not business friendly. I’m paying a lot of money for this and it’s not fair that I have all my notifications settings set correctly and I’m still receiving promotional push notifications. This has ultimately ruined the app experience from Wix. It makes me want to remove the app but I can’t for the sake of my customers, so because of that, I am rating 2 stars."
49,Jessjessbest,"February 3, 2020",2,"Crashes The app also crashes multiple times an hour. It is ALWAYS crashing. Doesn’t matter what phone I use. Also, it has endless problems. For instance, today it won’t upload my product photos. It is such a huge source of frustration, as I’ve already paid $400 this year to have them host my website. They also don’t have shipping like Etsy does, so you have to find an outside shipper or pay heavily for the one they’ve contracted with. They do have user friendly features, and I keep hoping they’ll improve. But I have definitely lost business, as customers tell me the website is often down. Regardless of following Wix IT support recommendations."
