0,James Brooks's iPhone,"March 26, 2018",3,"It’s great if you had nothing To start Out this app is pretty decent. If you get all the apps that integrates with this app then your off to a go start ,.... but if you already have other apps that do what this apps does.. like tells you what your heart rate is or was at a certain part of the day ( apples health app, under Armour record), or tells you where you were through out the day ( google maps, Facebook, yada yada yada) , or even take selfie pictures ( instagram, Flickr, Facebook) then you might want to hold off on getting this one. I’ve had it for about two weeks trying to get into a swing of things with it but just can’t. If I want to see where I was I have to go to another app that is supposed to work well with this app” moves” but if you didn’t save a location on that app this app don’t know where you went. If you didn’t record a work out then this app doesn’t know you worked out unless the other apps you save a workout in recorded a workout which then saves it to the health app then tells this app that you worked out ... and the list goes on. As I said this app is decent but not great. It missing so much of what I’d like to see this app have so I could use it as an ALL IN ONE app. Maybe down the road if this app and Company use the license or permissions to use other apps like apples health app or UA’s record app then maybe this would be a great warm almost perfect app to use but not till then. Is missing a lot of links."
1,Evilkow,"May 15, 2018",2,"Way too many bugs I really want this app to be great, but it simply has too many bugs. The app freezes up on a daily basis. It has trouble importing data from Apple Health. At the moment, I’m still waiting for step counts to update from yesterday even though I see the total in Apple Health and Garmin. Pull to refresh, and nothing happens. The sleep tracking is poor as well. I wear a device that tracks sleep, but for some reason, Gyroscope thinks it knows better and modifies that data with its “Sleep AI” making it incorrect. Location tracking is horrible too. I am connected to Foursquare as well as Gyroscope’s own location tracking, but if Gyroscope’s location tracking is turned on, it completely ignores the Foursquare data. Oh, and it has the same problem refreshing data. At the end of the day, it will often still show that I’ve only been at home in the morning. "
2,Angie(MillerTime),"March 20, 2020",1,"Bad business w/ no integrity I had this app for at least a year and really liked it. It didn't exactly have mind blowing features or anything, but still, it was nice to use. Just a few minutes ago I got a notification telling me that, after at least a year of using, I now need to pay them to keep using it. At all. So stupid. Apparently, they couldn't give two craps about their customers. Now, just like all the other idiot app devs, they are jumping on that seriously dimwitted subscription service, not even offering a limited free version. And even though they make it look like it's so fancy and does all these neat things, here on the app store, don't be fooled. Honestly, it's just a data and location tracker wrapped up in fake fancy packaging. So unless you like paying your hard earned money to a bad company that has no integrity and couldn't care less about you, just about how much they can get you to give them out of your wallet, and for an app that basically does and tells you the same things other actually FREE apps do and tell you, no less, then go ahead. Break out your wallet. You enjoy handing over your money for a useless app that does nothing for you except aggravate the heck out of you and frustrate you to no end. Me? I'm deleting this ASAP."
3,travlcas1,"January 20, 2018",5,The customer-hostile App Store obsession with subscription pricing is at its 100% worst here. Gorgeous data aggregator.
4,sgmiller,"April 12, 2020",5,Continues to improve This app has improved significantly over the last months and I am very happy with the direction it is taking. I had ranked it down based on poor sleep tracking but this seems to be working now. It is unique as it is the only app that I know of that seriously tries to integrate all of the various health information coming from Apple health. The relatively new health score is a great addition which makes a possible at a glance to see where you need improvement.
5,Mpillegi,"April 19, 2020",3,"The cost x benefit is nothing interesting Just in a time of crisis, not offering a free version anymore, is almost begging for a negative review.  I've been a subscriber twice, and I haven't really found a plausible justification for renewing.  The data seems to be more useful for the owner of the application than for the users, as it is not possible to take personal notes to learn from the mistakes and successes that the data point out.  The cost x benefit is nothing interesting.  I suppose the app had 1 paid user for every 10,000 free users and the decision seems to have been to get rid of free users, instead of trying to practice more affordable prices on a larger basis.  Anyway, despite being the best-designed app among thousands I've ever seen, it failed to make the complete transition from superfluous, to something essential in the day-to-day life of a person looking for improvement. "
6,Eternal Babybear,"July 28, 2018",3,"Much Improvement Needed With Facebook shutting down Moves, I’m looking for an alternative movement tracker app. I’ve been using Gyroscope for almost half a year. I downloaded it at first to analyze my Moves data. However, the free version of it didn’t seem to offer too much insight of my daily movement. It has nice graphics, though."
7,Dicksyatt,"September 14, 2019",5,"I’m very impressed The customer service is excellent. Very fast and patient. Before I linked my other apps and devices I was not impressed. But I have it talking with Apple Health, Oura Ring, QardioArm blood pressure, My Fitness Pal and others. Now, I can’t say enough how much I love the app. I’ve not experienced this with any other app but there are so many features that seem to appear every time I open the app. It’s very rich in content. It’s expensive, but so far I think it’s worth it. I was about to subscribe to Sleep Cycle for $30 a year but that’s just sleep. Gyroscope logs my meditation, work outs, food with pictures and breakdowns of each food. My life in one place. I’m recommending it to friends"
8,Mutty234,"April 15, 2020",2,App is getting much worse It's been really sad to experience the changes in the app lately.
9,Rretzler,"July 17, 2018",1,"Awful without Moves data I subscribed to the pro version as I knew that my favorite location tracking app, Moves, was going away. I’m very disappointed in Gyroscope- many times it doesn’t even record that I have left my house even when I have gone 25 miles across town and stayed for over an hour. As far as my sleep tracking  - it is ridiculously off as well. Bedtimes are incorrect as are times I get up. Frequently it recorded me still being in bed when I had been up and around with my phone in my pocket for a couple of hours. It doesn’t do a good job for what I wanted it to do and I wish I had not subscribed or could get my money back.  Unfortunately the things that I wanted to track were not available in the free version so I had to subscribe. Frankly I would not even keep the free version for all the errors the app has - it is certainly not worth the subscription price."
10,Xiaoranz1986,"December 24, 2017",5,"Timecapsule for Data Geeks I am a data geek, particularly about travels, foods and fitness. I have been consistently tracking multiple aspects of my life for years now and seeing them all come together and presented in a beautiful and practical way by gyroscope is highly satisfying. I can point to certain months in the past and gain insights about my state of mind at that time; having all the data in one place also makes me able to plan my day and week in a balanced manner (e.g. sleep, work, food, fitness, meditation, travels)."
11,Whitey Nip,"December 29, 2017",5,Top Notch I was a skeptic about the cost of the pro features however I invested in the pro features and have been very impressed. This app literally organizes your life into one nice place.
12,LiddleLid,"April 11, 2018",1,"Still some work to do.. Love the interface, love the idea of having all my tracked data in one place; however, it rarely seems to work. The whole point is ease of analysis, but every day something else isn’t syncing (first calories, then sleep, now workouts). I then have to tweak multiple settings on my phone, tinker around with app access, and next thing I know I’ve spent way more time than I wish to trying to improve the functionality of this app. I’ve viewed their website for help- more of an advertisement than a help page. I’ve contacted them regarding the issues and they just send me screen shots proving that it should be working. Very frustrated with how much time I’ve invested for no return. Save your time.. for now. This is the wave of the future, just needs some serious fine tuning."
13,Tbobx,"May 1, 2018",5,"Great Data Collection & Analysis I’ve been using Gyroscope Pro for close to two years now and am impressed by how accurate it is and how it shows my day, week and month activities. I have used it consistently so it definitely keeps my attention and interest. "
14,Maks Koseda,"January 24, 2019",5,"Great idea, worse execution I absolutely love the idea behind the app. It helps me reflect on my health habits and especially computer usage. "
15,Jeffrey75088,"March 31, 2019",2,"Disappoints in keys areas I wanted so much to like the app. I purchased the subscription, which for the monthly price, I can not see how the developers justify it. There is not a lot gained from the pro version. The places portion for the continued use of GPS and large portion of my battery use it is highly off. It will continually tell me that a location is 100+ miles away yet it is down the street. For $9.99 a month I expect an app to wow me and this is far from it. Simply put it pulls all information from other apps and tried to combine them into useful data. With the amount of competition in this area Gyroscrope is grossly overpriced and lacks anything except some mildly okay asthietics. I have cancelled my subscription and because of the extremely ridiculous battery useage see myself deleting it soon."
16,Miedvied,"April 28, 2019",2,"Apple Health with a prettier UI As best as I can tell this amounts to little more than a prettier UI for Apple health, plus/minus some location tracking and an opaque overall “health” number (Pro only, with no real insight as to where the number comes from or it’s validity.) It promises to centralize your data, but Health already does that fairly well (as does MFP, etc.) If this app has anything more to offer, such as actual actionable insights from your data, it’s not visible from Free User Land."
17,PIDGEYSMALLz,"May 15, 2019",2,"Cool app ruined by major battery isssues This app is very unique and almost exactly what I’m looking for in a tracking app - there’s options to set location precision, view history, edit locations and more, and what’s more it’s reliable and extremely accurate. Unfortunately there’s on huge issue: battery life."
18,pookerella,"June 9, 2019",4,"Extremely responsive developer, beautiful interface I got this as a replacement to Moves and it comes pretty close! It was challenging in the beginning but it improved all the time. They have too many things going on IMO but when I couldn’t get to my Places, I wrote them and they told me they just changed a setting but they would fix it! And they did! Really lovely CS, very helpful, nice, listen to what you say. I tried a few others who supposedly are a replacement for Moves (all are dreadful) but Gyroscope comes the closest IMO. A little pricey but at least you get decent CS. And it truly WORKS."
19,LuigiGun,"December 9, 2019",2,"The app is OK but not worth all that money Yeah I get it. No one likes working for free. Closing the app for people who want to burn their money on an app that hardly gets the job done is an insult. I remember purchasing a month and I wasn’t convinced that it was worth even getting the years rate which is what I normally do when an app covers all the grounds necessary. Here’s some advice, instead of a testimonial, give people the chance to experience the pro version before they purchase it. And second, bring something to the table that will smack your competition to the ground if you guys want to charge so much. I give 2 stars because I enjoyed the Apple Watch feature. That was literally the only reason I kept the app on my phone. Anyhow, let me know when you guys can lower the rate or actually give me my moneys worth.  Good luck"
20,Clifford Fajardo,"November 27, 2017",5,Must Have Fitness App If your wanting to track your fitness & health then this is a must have app! The free version is great & the pro version is amazing! You can also connect with your friends & see how you compare with them which is awesome. Gyroscope beautifully displays all your health data (also from health kit) & is probably one of the best designed apps I've seen in a while.
21,Vrnsn,"June 9, 2018",5,"Becoming the go-to activity store I’ve been on and off using gyroscope for about two years now.  And, it’s improved tons. Native tracking (available for pro users for a while) is simply eye catching (even in its currently beta form) and no significant impact on battery. "
22,ARKellogg,"August 18, 2018",5,"Keeps getting better This may be my first ever app review.  I found it useful from the beginning, but definitely had a share of frustrations on how it recorded some of my days and getting the reports I wanted. The latest update is great! And definitely helps me to identify trends to my health. My one remaining complaint is that it won’t integrate with AutoSleep. Instead it just lists the amount of time spent in bed, which is a far different metric."
23,Cary N.,"August 24, 2018",5,"Gyroscope is awesome Compared to the Moves app that I used until Facebook pulled the plug and the MovesX app I was going to use, Gyroscope is way easier to use and the user interface is absolutely a thing of beauty. I have yet to upgrade to the pro features, but I’m seriously considering it to get the cool summary reporting and additional features. I only have to identify new places once. After that it remembers that place every time I return and summarizes how much time I’ve spent there over the last week or month."
24,myk_r,"August 30, 2018",2,"Location tracking is awful The location tracking and step counter in Gyroscope used to be pretty good. Unfortunately, since migrating away from Moves to their own tracker called Places, the app is basically useless and not worth a fraction of what I pay for a pro account. "
25,cdohertyk,"September 17, 2018",3,"Confusing, unfocused The app has gotten increasingly confusing over time. I paid for Pro, hoping for a hub that would beautifully connect all of my health data, and instead I just got feature bloat, annoying notifications, and vanity UI instead of the functionality I want. That, and load time performance is bad. It often takes 15–30 seconds to load something as simple as the notification feed."
26,MikeW301,"December 1, 2018",5,"This is the best health app. After you discover and sync up third-party apps this app introduces you too, you can effectively be better at office work, focus/flow, weight loss, staying keto, or even being mindful through meditation integration."
27,rocket ship pilot,"January 20, 2019",5,"I enjoy this app For me, not only is this a helpful view of my health/exercise/steps plus my travels, because of Places feature, it has become a living journal of destinations. By me  going back to fill in the unknown places I visit, I reflect on what I’ve been doing - and why. "
28,Joe Miramonti,"March 6, 2020",4,"Rich interface sometimes confusing It’s not always obvious how to find information because the interface is so complex. I just want to use this app to track where I’ve been and how long, which it does fairly accurately, but it required interaction with support just to figure out how to jump to a particular date. "
29,ben8718,"November 2, 2019",1,"Dark Pattern The apps tricks you into sharing all your data by not mentioning any form of payment. Once you’re done with the list of things it wants you to share (which is almost all your health data) a button magically appears under that list asking you to become a paying member to use the app. So basically, you either pay up or part ways from the data you just shared while getting zilch in return. Not even a day of analytics. Don’t do what I did. Don’t share all your personal information with an app that lure’s you with analytics. They’ll basically hold your data hostage until you pay up."
30,BT_89,"November 20, 2017",5,"Great App - Getting Better All The Time I've been looking for an app to aggregate all the various data that gets collected by my digital life. Gyroscope is finally that app, and I love it.  It works seamlessly and looks great!"
31,gracegonzz,"April 19, 2018",5,"Love it, but a few suggestions I really enjoy using this app! I only have a few suggestions on my “wish list.” If Gyroscope were to track real time money spending (or net worth; including stock values, etc), menstrual cycles, and have a little “diary” feature, I would be OVERJOYED. Maybe not even diary - but little notes - to say “I forgot my notebook at home and that’s why I scored a bad mood this morning.” Thanks, Gyroscope!"
32,cbrown78501,"July 26, 2018",2,I had high hopes I was looking for something to replace Moves which is ending in a few days. I'd like to be able to look back through my history and see where I was on a particular date and time. The good reviews for this encouraged me to purchase the pro subscription. However after only a few days I see its location tracking is very poor. Errors are not easily editable. The interface is attractive but difficult to see and use and confusing. I wish Moves wasn't going away. That's all I wanted. Clear. Simple. Accurate.
33,SidePrime,"August 20, 2018",2,"Pretty, but fails at its core function of location tracking I got this as a replacement for Moves, and was excited about Gyroscope’s fancy interface and additional features. However, the app fails its core function: tracking my location. Frequently, when I open the app at the end of a day Gyroscope has failed to capture any of the locations I visited, or even that I left home at all! I am paying for the pro version right now, and I am getting less usefulness than when I had the free Moves app. Very disappointing."
34,jeremys_,"August 24, 2018",5,"One of the best iOS app out there If you’re slightly curious about yourself and interested in introducing good habits, Gyroscope is the best app. "
35,jnobo,"October 30, 2018",2,"Does not work with FitBit So the concept of the app is great but it forces you to use Apple Health. In my experience Apple Health has been extremely inaccurate, especially the sleep feature. Gyroscope’s predicted sleep feature is no better. I bought a FitBit to combat this, and I am happy with the results. They make it seem like you can retrieve data from Fitbit but you actually have to delete the data from Apple and input your data manually. As someone who paid for the membership I think this is a complete waste of my time and money."
36,King Shaka,"January 4, 2019",1,A beautifully designed battery hog I have so wanted this app to work for me over the years.  I've downloaded & deleted each update promising better battery conservation.  It just doesn't happen.
37,growltiger23,"April 2, 2019",4,"Great idea but needs some work still I love the idea and the privacy policy, but the biggest stopper for me so far is battery life. If you have location tracking on this app uses between 25-35% of the battery all the time, basically rendering my phone dead within less than a day every time. "
38,bb9078,"May 11, 2019",2,"Challenges not showing up I really think this is a great app but when I try to add my friend to challenges, I get a notification that they've accepted the challenge but nothing shows up in leader board. We've tried a few times and still nothing. We thought it would be a fun way to be more active. And there's no clear direction on how to find your friends. You have to go to ""cards"" and then ""leader board"" and then ""create challenge"" before you can search for them. Even though we've added each other already."
39,Falluso,"August 23, 2019",4,"Great product but overpriced I really like this app. It is useful and somewhat insightful. I wish it would provide more actual and relevant guidance. It could also use a well documented user guide. Finally, I think they are making a mistake by only integrating HRV data from the Apple Watch when there are other apps that are more established, effective and utilized by users. Not sure if I will continue with my Pro subscription after this year."
40,mgiven,"November 22, 2017",5,Fantastic Health Tracking Just keeps inproving!  This app is a great personal tracking app.  Takes information from the most popular health apps and puts it in one place for you.  I find myself checking it multiple times a day just to see the changes. If you are into self-tracking this is a must have. Beautifully designed too!
41,trilit110,"November 29, 2017",5,"Must have for quantified self fans Gyroscope Pro is a smooth, beautiful way for me to keep track of all the data that’s available to collect on myself. I really appreciate the constant updates and discussion with the community, and so far I’ve had only good experiences with integration. Can’t wait for the Places update so I can get the Moves functionality back!"
42,Darth1642,"December 8, 2017",5,"This app keeps getting better With all the various apps I am using to track my life (fitness, Heart rate, online, etc)This app brings all of them together. This app helps me see my progress in a beautiful and easy way."
43,bhunt01,"July 21, 2018",1,"Color crazy, overly complicated, overpriced, noise machine This could be a useful app but the frequent dark color on dark background or light color on light background choices are just ridiculous. Make the data readable by using the kinds of color schemes that most apps use. And make color choice 1) sticky and 2) universal within the app"
44,Yale Bloor,"August 2, 2018",1,Good idea bad app App is beautiful to look at but is not user friendly you have to adjust sleep time everyday and app misses a lot of your various locations during the day so that has to be done manually also. And of course to get full use of app requires a upgrade / charge ... why pay and upgrade when app is buggy and time consuming to start ... make the app work seamlessly then charge ... big time waster all the info is available on other apps it’s just using that info and not in a very good way ... Beautiful looks ... but a waste of time
45,snellshein,"August 12, 2018",4,"Hoping to replace Moves Still evaluating this app for my needs. I’m looking for a simple app to automatically record & map my activity including walking, running, kayaking & biking. Although i had to download other apps to record some of these activities so they could be counted, i don’t see them showing up on the report page."
46,ERG1980,"March 2, 2019",5,"Great but one issue If you live in a city and take the subway, the Places and travel mapping can be a little wonky but then again most apps have issues with GPS tracking when you’re underground. Maybe when location accuracy is below a threshold don’t record or mark it in some way?"
47,ElementalTravel,"April 19, 2019",2,Small graphics +low vision Gyroscope app would be more interesting if locations tracked via the new built in “Places” Map were larger. The problem is a lot of the data is presented in in type size too small for people with low vision. 
48,adimiron,"April 19, 2019",5,I thought about making this app... ...and I'm glad someone did it for me.
49,rcz66,"November 17, 2019",2,So far really disappointed Been using the app for a little over a month and am really frustrated. Crashes multiple times a day. Does not track most of my day. Even when open will just randomly shut down and then refuse to start until reboot of phone and removal and reinstallation of app.  So far a complete waste of my money. Had high hopes but they have been dashed. If I had a choice I would want my money back and find an app that actually works for tracking.
50,Jeffboek,"November 17, 2017",5,"The perfect app for jumping into Quantified Self Not only does this app look amazing, it does a great job of being a hub for just about anything you want to track. The people behind this have done a great job taking all that boring data and turning it into something beautiful."
51,ManikRa,"November 20, 2017",5,Track your Heath with ease — this the best Gyroscope is the best. I open this app more than any other. It's amazing to be able to see all of this data about your life without having to spend hours doing it yourself. 
52,iSteeeve,"February 6, 2018",1,All This Money For a Pro App I went for 6 mos and I’m in 10 Days or so. At first it integrated my data from Moves and AutoSleep. Then suddenly it stopped gathering and lost all the data from Moves. Still connected but shows no data. No locations.
53,nobooboograde,"May 20, 2018",3,"RescueTime Any update on when it will be available to download and syncs with your program. So far I had gotten the basics down, and want to see what it is like long term. I like it and that it’s a one stop app for what I would have to open multiple windows for. Will be back to update after rescue time is available and when I use it more."
54,Spencer_Davis_,"July 19, 2018",2,"Even free version needs work I want to like this app, but it seems like (overall) it simply just needs more work. Places doesn’t accurately track half of my day, and often doesn’t record me leaving one place to the next. The travel route map that shows where you went is also consistently, 100% incorrect."
55,Ignatius_J_Reilly,"August 20, 2018",1,"terrible replacement for Moves I just took a 2 mile walk starting and ending at my home, with my phone charged up and connected to good solid cell service the entire time. Gyroscope believes that I walked 26 feet. Moves tracked my movements quite accurately and at a much lower battery consumption then this app. I don’t understand the engineering, I guess, but the experience of using this app is quite poor compared to Moves. Other developers out there: get to work on this, I bet people would pay for it if it was good!"
56,Hbo33,"September 30, 2018",1,"Warning If your using other health apps already this will screw then up. I had Cardiogram installed and it stopped syncing with my iPhone/watch as soon as I installed gyroscope. Even after uninstalling gyroscope it wouldn’t sync. Cardiogram has been removed from complications. I couldn’t uninstall and reinstall the app on my watch. The only thing I could do was reset my watch. I lost all of my data even though I restored from backup. This app is should be avoided if you already are happy with what you’ve got. To me, it’s malware."
57,oxjox,"November 1, 2018",1,Fails to accurately track your location and movements. Most times it says I’ve been walking for several hours when In fact I’m in one location and the phone is stationary. If I try to convert that ‘walk’ to a location it’s some random location miles away.

61,Jwu,"January 9, 2018",5,It just keeps getting better Congrats to the team behind Gyroscope it’s gotten exponentially better and valuable as the years have gone by. The pro version of the app is absolutely. worth the extra features.
62,nshellab,"July 7, 2018",5,"Useful, fun, and beautiful What's more fun than reviewing your health and productivity data from your Fitbit, rescuetime, phone, etc?

63,clinlx,"July 27, 2018",4,"Great app, wish subscription has family plan Overall great app on keeping track of your daily life, it would be great if there are a family subscription plan like Apple Music for a lower cost so the whole family can enjoy the pro feature."
64,nospecialfx,"July 28, 2018",2,"Places data is awful Scrapping Moves for their own native places tracker was a huge mistake. It’s a mess. My map looks like someone scribbled on it. It constantly misses places I’m at for hours, once said I walked nearly 2000 miles while actually on a plane and is impossible to fix or clear on your own. Response from the developers is usually oh we fixed that in the next release. No, you didn’t."
65,Really paranoid,"December 10, 2018",5,Battery usage increasing alarmingly I had moves. It used 10% of battery a day. You started out that way. But places was often inaccurate. 
66,wfbarks,"March 1, 2019",5,"Pro user for ~2 years, love it! Great app, the team behind it is always improving it and putting out updates. I have sync data from RescueTime, Apple Watch and thats enough to make the output pretty interesting and informative."
67,chasemiddaugh,"May 6, 2019",2,"Latest update seems to have hampered usefulness This most recent version has created a badge notification that won’t go away, the “adjust” button on sleep tracking not being functional, a lack of knowing when steps were last updated, and overall clunkiness. Rally hoping the next update addresses these issues"
68,Nullgeo,"June 5, 2019",3,"Good functionality but battery drainage is an issue I have been using this app for about 2 weeks and I have noticed that my iPhone dies really fast since I made this app active. I do love the places and steps counter feature, though. Beyond that I haven’t explored many other features. I also love the UI/UX design of this app."
69,alixorus,"February 4, 2020",4,Amazing but overpriced for me This is a really cool app however it is 2-4x what I would be willing to pay for the value I get from it.

The app does a great job of simplifying the key variables that are important for your health, and making it easy to spot any anomolies.

Sure, there is a little bit of up front setup required to slurp all of your various data sources, but it's worth it."
193,ctcast,"November 7, 2016",5,"Quantify Your Life I've been a user since the beginning and it just gets better and better. The visualizations, responsiveness, and insights into your everyday life are priceless. The integrations alone are worth it. With a team of two who are hustling hard to make this the best tracking app and release new features consistently, it's hard not to support the development with a pro account. I can't say enough about Gyroscope. So good!"

195,BaeNextDoor,"December 17, 2016",1,"Nope and nope. Another app that forces you to use Facebook as the sole means of creating an account/logging in. There is an option that you can select to use your email address instead, but tapping on it leads you to a webpage where you input your name and email to be ""notified"" when alternate login methods are available. You mean to tell me that if I don't allow you to intrude on my social media account, I can't use the app? No thanks. I don't have a Facebook account and it's a shame so many apps force you to have one just to create an account or save data. All the 5 star reviews sound like they were written by the same person anyway."

I have experienced a couple bugs I'll write in to support about, but considering this is an app made by two people that's incredible! I will say that it feels like I'm stuck being told what's possible in many screens in the app, but it's not entirely clear how to go about doing them. That can be improved with further design work though, and I'm sure the app will get there. Great job guys!"

Wake up to the internet doubters cuz it's back with a vengeance. I just personally want to take this opportunity to speak about the important of googles social efforts that we undertake. Don't let anyone, not even a bully of immense proportion! You are the carrier of the message and it all comes down to you. Seek the truth, it always amazes me."

Keep up the good work and keep more integrations coming!!"

The new goals feature looks great and I like that it's easier to visualize and manage single week chunks instead of month/year chunks. This is yet another feature that makes me glad I'm a Gyroscope Pro member! Keep it up team 💯👍"

Health-wise it had no impact yet, no proper educated goals can be set."

214,Watzupmark,"November 7, 2016",5,Beautiful and slick This is a really good example where design and good UX can make data fun to engage with and easy to understand.

Kudos to the Gyroscope crew!"

How can you justify a subscription fee for that, and at such an insane price point no less? This app is pretty, though. I think? It was hard to tell with such limitations and ridiculous amounts of pro subscription advertising. I'd pay a $9.99 one time fee, but this developer is out of their mind. There isn't even a widget to really make it useful."

343,jjrosent,"May 9, 2017",5,Beautiful Realization of the quantified self movement Be been a pro user for some time now. Gyro has become my favorite iOS app and the only thing still keeping me on iOS (in addition to android not having a HealthKit comparable). I've been tracking random things for years but not until gyro brought it all together for me did I have (beautiful) dashboard for myself and others to start gaining insights from that data.
344,rgrgeo,"May 17, 2018",3,"Great concept, needs work First off all this app is really good.  Beautiful UI and offers excellent options for tracking. What needs work is all the connections and the process of making connections.  Instagram, Twitter, Last.fm all fail to connect.  The location app Moves appears to connect but there is no confirmation, so who knows if the connection is actually working.  They need to improve the connections to other apps and include validation in the process of making those connections.  Regardless of so much failed functionality, I do get a beautiful way to track several things in one place.  I will be  sticking with Gyroscope in hopes that their connections improve as development builds. Good app, with with work, will be great."
345,shyam.patel,"July 14, 2018",5,"Latest update fixed battery Edit: 7/14/18 - got a notification that the devs replied to my review and as mentioned, they are correct. I was on places beta when the original review was posted. One of their updates completely crippled battery life. They responded to my email and mentioned that they would be releasing a fix soon. I think it was a week later when the update came through and battery life resumed as normal. "

348,EddyGeez!,"January 18, 2020",4,"Useful day-to-day insights, but missing one thing Gyroscope is good if you are interested in quantified-self data and analysis. All of the background battery-drain issues have been fixed. By linking it to my Last.fm scrobble data (using the Eavescrob app on the phone and NepTunes on macOS), I get info on when I’m listening to music. By linking to RescueTime, I get data on when I’m being productive. By linking to Health, I get data on my exercise and sleep habits. By linking to my location (which has settings for granularity), I get info on where I’ve been. The list goes on and on. The real beauty comes when Gyroscope takes all that data, mashes it all together, and makes visualizations, which the Gyroscope team is pretty good at."
349,Warrior.Disciple,"June 24, 2019",4,3.5/5 I’ll explain. I wish I could say I’m 100% satisfied w the pro version but I’m not motivated enough to stay w the pro version. Until I see a Spotify integration and a better way to see my macros not just the basic fat/carb/protein intake I’ll consider a yearly subscription unless the monthly rate lowers to at least $10/month which is more than enough for what this app does. I was under the impression it would do more than just ask me how I’m doing everyday and rating my life from my workout/sleep patterns. Tbh I can get that from another app that’s relatively cheaper. I love the social concept it’s trying to bring and I know this rating sounds like a haters point of view but it’s not. I’ve been looking for a full descent fitness/life hub for the longest time and the app has great potential. Not a fan of having to download other apps to fully experience this one. Needs work but what keeps me going is the challenge section of this app. It’s based on every aspect of leading a healthy lifestyle not just step count like most fitness apps.
