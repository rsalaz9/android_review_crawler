0,NorwoodG,"March 24, 2020",5,"Great  job! Congratulations to the coding team behind Joplin.  They managed to create a note-taking/journaling solution that can fill what I perceived as a long-standing ""gap"": the ability to sync between the iPad and the Macbook without having to go through the cloud. For those who value privacy this is a terrific development. "
1,Nickian,"April 30, 2020",3,"Excellent on desktop, barely passable on mobile Joplin is amazing on Desktop, but the mobile version is behind. It has improved a bit over the last couple of years, but I wish it were more of a mobile-first project."
2,Playin' in a Travelin' Band,"October 6, 2018",2,"Pretty buggy interface I love the syncing features, but the interface for entering text is so buggy, the app is pretty much unusable, except for reading notes entered elsewhere. Sometimes when I type, everything randomly comes out all-caps. Auto-correct does not work at all, and predictive text sees each letter as a separate word. Using dictation works - but only one word at a time. : /  "
3,jekpopulous,"June 17, 2018",5,"This app is fantastic. I'm using it with Nextcloud on my iPhone and Macbook...it's awesome. I've run into a couple bugs and the GUI could be a little nicer but Joplin honestly has all the features that I was looking for. If you take privacy seriously and want a full-featured, cross-platform notes app this is for you."
4,cpinegar,"December 15, 2019",4,"Make iOS user interface as functional as Windows This app together with Dropbox has some serious potential to kick Evernote and Standard Notes to the curb, if you want an app with native markdown support, cross-platform support, and end-to-end encryption, give Joplin a try."
5,a16556dw,"February 22, 2020",5,I love it so much I was looking for the person knowledge management software long time until install Joplin.
6,NightTriker,"February 19, 2019",1,Incredibly confusing interface This app is very difficult to use as it doesn’t follow normal iOS ways of doing things.
7,Nytraveler,"February 12, 2020",5,"Improved Typing seems to be much improved over previous reviews. The number of syncing options is pretty good, but I would love to get it working with pCloud drive. I think I could do it through my pc file system, but don’t know what the directory’s absolute path would be in iOS."
8,linuxdaemon,"January 25, 2020",4,"Serious Evernote contender as a whole ...but the iOS experience is not optimal. It works, and you can edit all your notes or todo lists just fine. But it doesn't act like an iOS app. The interface doesn't match an iOS feel, and you can't send things to it or interact with a hard-press/widget. "
9,Bobthefoodie,"March 21, 2019",5,Amazing for all my operating systems Fantastic way to keep markdown supported notes in the iPhone and also OS X / Linux (and all the other Joplin supported OSes). I am using Dropbox for my cloud sync and so far it has been flawless.  
10,迎宾路保鲁斯,"June 22, 2018",3,"couldn't attach picture from camera. i can attach picture from Picture Library, but not from camera."
11,Jgreene7,"July 16, 2018",3,"Photo Text-wise, this is an awesome app. Especially with nested folders. "
12,cacofonix1,"August 20, 2018",5,"Cross Platform Outliner with ToDo I have been looking for an Outliner with unlimited nested folders with ability to set a reminder at any level.  Have purchased Upword and Datagist and have free versions of Agenda, Quoire and numerous others. But all have some flaw or other or are too complex for my needs.  I use Cintanotes on the PC and Simplenote but they lack ability to set alarms. This app may be it. "
13,Waghon,"January 16, 2019",4,"The writing zone too wide Hi, Dev"
14,a vim user,"February 12, 2020",5,"Really awesome app Way better than the standard note taking app and way better than googles app. Also it’s cross platform, configurable and most importantly open source!"
15,NevousNecro,"March 25, 2020",4,"Fantastic, but... Sometimes the notes kind of freeze in place. When you try to scroll down while in edit mode, it just snaps back to the top."
16,SkyBolts,"April 11, 2020",4,"Bugs Good stuff, minor caveat. When you rotate the screen, it doesn't automatically resize what's on the screen. The result is a black bar on the side of the sceeen. Zooming in fixes the problem."
17,A902450928543,"January 7, 2020",5,"Essential. FOSS, E2E-encrypted, multi-platform notes. "
18,What is this nonsense,"June 18, 2019",5,Images Images not displaying on iPhone or iPad since recent update.
19,Major_Ursa,"September 16, 2019",5,Hidden Gem of an App Awesome little notebook app. Sure it’s not as polished as say OneNote but for the security you get w/ end to end encryption it’s totally worth it
20,pzeos,"January 23, 2018",4,Great start Great start to use Joplin on iOS.  Needs iCloud Drive and iPad Pro support.  Thanks!
21,RoyMcKenzie,"April 13, 2018",2,Uses an android based UI Should match Apple HIG
22,jlnvs,"November 21, 2018",5,"Fantastic writing application This app is open source and is one of the rare markdown text editors which run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. "
23,igifuekfkfud,"February 1, 2019",5,Perfect note app that I have been looking for I have just spent several days searching for an alternative to the Evernote that I have been using for almost a decade. I even created a comparison sheet for myself to figure out which option has what functions that I like and don't. And I end up switching to Joplin. So far I have been loving all the features that Joplin comes with. It pretty much fits all I want. The only thing I haven't tested is that can Joplin still be fast when I feed it with ~3k posts.
24,Maax3739373,"July 21, 2019",5,Fantastic Thank you for contributing to open source software
25,Angelr91,"February 1, 2020",3,"Real potential App has real potential but needs to have some key features. OCR, proper share with images or attachments"
26,失望的豆瓣老用户,"September 13, 2019",3,还不错但还是evernote吧 不满足我的需求，在用户使用层面了无新意。只是简单的记笔记有很多替代品，在有ervenote前我就一直寻找能够方便记录下所有灵感的笔记软件/硬件，从前有palm，而迄今为止最符合需求的软件只有evernote，尽管臃肿反应慢，但只有它是简单直接满足需求的，其他的替代品比如这个比如simplenote都有点太想当然的工程师思维了，我相信很大一批用户和我需求类似，他们想要的不是简单地有个地方记笔记，而是更方便地记录下灵感，这是两个完全不同的用户需求，如果只是记笔记同步这么简单，我有太多太多类似的服务可以选，但随时记录灵感我没得选，我不介意哪怕记录灵感这件事成为一个launcher都好只要它方便够快，但一个记笔记软件超过100k我都觉得大。说实话我完全不能理解为什么有那么多几乎一模一样的云端笔记软件，所有的都在关注怎么同步更省钱支不支持markdown，而没有几个愿意把怎么样才能更好地捕捉灵感这件事做的更好一些，在我看来这是不可理喻的单纯与目光狭隘，毕竟这个世界上的工程师是少数，而更多的人类是在为人类工作，请更注重如何跟人类打交道而不是跟机器打交道。
27,I Made A Bribe,"April 16, 2020",5,"“Dark Mode” The Dark Mode isn’t very good for use because of there’re something necessary to fix and improve.If you can hear that what I say,hope you could find something better to do it and shape it wonderfully."
28,DannyGGGT,"December 26, 2019",2,"Can’t search, & aesthetics need work. Big promise here with the feature set and cross-platform focus, **but** there doesn’t seem to be a way to search within a note, which is a pretty basic feature. You _can_ search all notes to find which notes contain search terms, but won’t get brought to that term within the note, nor can you start a search from within a note. So this app may be good for only short notes, but I cannot use it as-is for my main note taking app. "
29,Rahul Bhattacharya,"September 28, 2019",5,"Perfect Evernote replacement #DeleteEvernote Being an avid Evernote Premium power-user since last 7 years, it took me a lot to investigate the features and usability of Joplin to evaluate the pros and cons, and ultimately the decision was not hard, Joplin is a clear winner here."
