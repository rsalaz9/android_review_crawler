0,JPimemtel,"March 9, 2018",4,I’ve used Skype for almost 2 years daily now My girlfriend and I are long distance so we call each other on the daily until she visits. I’ve used Skype over other apps and I have to say it has it’s ups and downs. 
1,SYPHIN F14,"July 4, 2019",4,"11 years of experience I’ve been using Skype for more than 11 years now, through its ups and downs. Just finally installed the most recent version on my iPhone X, so haven’t used it for a few months now. This version is more stable, and higher quality than I’ve seen from Skype for a while. When we first started using it, talking back and forth between Japan and the United States in 2008, it was the only game in town and it was great to have! "
2,Yanuwaya,"April 4, 2018",3,"used to be good but... i’ve used skype on and off for a few years. i think of skype as “that video call app” because originally it was just to call people as either a video call, audio call, and “chat”(because nobody really uses it) app. i feel like with all these new updates skype is using up valuable space both on said persons phone which instead they could be using on improving the quality of the apps features. not making new features and icons and lists and tips that nobody is going to use. "
3,Luna Lunita Lunera,"March 7, 2019",3,"Focus on Call Quality PLEASE This is why we use the app — to make video calls or phone calls to loved ones. Connections are inconsistent, depending upon where one or both parties are situated in their respective locations. With cellular coverage and WiFi (most times, combined) this shouldn’t even be an issue. There should never be dropped calls nor lagging connections. "
4,Cookeram,"September 16, 2018",3,"Not bad, but... Definitely an overall good calling app. I’ve used things like FaceTime and Snapchat to make video calls before, but they just don’t work as well. Skype usually seems to load no matter what, unless the connection is extremely poor which isn’t the fault of Skype. One of the main drawbacks is all the buttons littering the screen. Like many other reviewers have stated, things are a bit over crowded, especially for a phone app. My screen is small enough as it is and I want to see the person I’m talking to. That’s the point of the video call. My biggest gripe here is the poor internet connection notification box. Can we please move the poor internet connection notification box? It pops up right in the center of the screen! Thanks for telling me I have a poor connection, but I don’t understand why something can’t pop up in the corner. This notification blocks my whole entire screen so I can’t see who I’m talking to. This just makes me want to use an app that doesn’t tell me about the strength of my internet connection (because I don’t care about that information anyways). It would definitely be a five star app if these few problems could get addressed."
5,MT writer,"December 5, 2018",4,"Works well, some glitches I live in a rural area where my cell phone mostly does not work, and the small local phone company here has expensive rates for unlimited long distance — even if I call the next town over. I use Skype (I have a Skype phone number), ooma, or WhatsApp, to telecommute and call out of my limited area. Skype is better than ooma because the quality is usually good and I can reliably make outgoing calls or connect to meetings such as via zoom or gotomeeting. Sometimes my internet connection strength seems to fluctuate though, and my Skype calls break up or echo and distort. My biggest criticism is that people I call may see a long 01 number with no name and without my correct location in their caller ID. Sometimes they do see my correct information but mostly not. With the current deluge of robo calls, this means often recipients are cautious about answering my calls. Overall as a telecommuter, I am happy to have Skype ... without it, connecting for meetings and doing business would be a lot more difficult and expensive."
6,walkingwhitecloud,"September 22, 2018",4,"Works Well With 50-mps Wifi 1) My experience with Skype over the last six years has been very good on both my laptop and my iPhone. I mostly use Skype for calling telephone numbers. Indeed, I have listened to lectures by dialing a phone number and experiencing excellent connections for hours at time. "
7,warofbangtantaetae,"January 24, 2019",4,"Suggestions are annoying and crashes often I’ve used Skype for 2-3 years now and it wasn’t really that bad. I used it everyday to call and text my friends. But there’s a slight problem. There are always these suggestions I can use if I send a message or someone sends me a message. I press the button that these aren’t useful, but they keep coming back! I dislike the suggestions because I accidentally keep pressing it and it immediately sends and makes my friend confused. Also, whenever I call someone, it won’t even let me turn off my phone! It is so annoying because when I turn off my phone so save battery while calling, it immediately hangs up. Whenever I call on the computer and go on another tab at the same time (like playing a game), it affects my game. It freezes my game all the time. Also, my Skype just crashes when I call on the computer. It immediately closes the tab and hangs up. It gets me and my friend really irritated. I love this app but it just has a few problems that needs to be fixed"
8,Murderous duck floatie,"March 31, 2020",3,"Personal gripes with how it works My biggest complaint is that anyone in the chat can do whatever they want with it. One person can start a group, and another person can change the name, picture, group members, etc. Which means anyone who wants to be annoying can just remove people for “a joke” or whatever. Anyone can kick you from the call or the group, no matter who that person is, or whether they’re toxic or not. I tolerate them because they’re not all bad, but then they pull something where they try to remake the group, and remove anyone who disagrees. Only the one who made the group should be able to remove people from the call/group, and edit it in any way."
9,#hashtagr,"June 15, 2018",4,"This would have been 5 stars if only... Alright so I use Skype all the time and I love it because it has such a good quality of sound and it’s significantly better than the normal phone call. I love that it’s fairly easy to use and that you can change the colors of your background to match your personality behaves who doesn’t want to express themselves?!?! Anyways, I literally love this app but there’s only one problem. Why don’t I get any notifications while I’m on a call??? I’ve missed some very important messages and I’ve almost been grounded on many occasions due to the fact that I’m not getting the notifications while I’m in a call. And what’s even worse is that my boyfriend has been using Skype for WAAAYYYYY longer than I have and he’s had this problem the entire time he’s been using it but just never said anything about it. Alongside of myself, all of my friends have the same problem and was wondering if that minor problem could possibly be fixed because it would life a lot easier. Thank you very much."
10,Jasmine Kennedy/Egias,"March 3, 2018",5,"I love Skype!!!! I would definitely recommend Skype to my friends and family and I already have some on the platform! I know you love to make money and all, but I think you should remove paying to call on mobile. I think it’s just stupid. But you can make groups and call with the groups, I honestly love it. The reason I’m writing this and taking time out of my day, That’s how much I love Skype! I get to share photos and I also found family members in the You may know section! If you haven’t downloaded Skype your wasting your time. (Well doing it kinda wastes your time but in a good way!) I really love Skype and the creators, thank you for all of your hard work on this application/App. I would write more but I’m out of ideas to talk about and I think this review is really long, again thank you for reading this, and all your hard work Skype. Bye!"
11,Mimmilala,"July 6, 2018",1,"Integrated Calling NOT Optional I’ve used Skype for a long time, ever since MSN was bought by Microsoft and I’ve had the app for as long as I’ve had a smartphone. Skype app has always been buggy. You’d expect seamless connections across all platforms but that has not always been the case and it gets infuriating when I’m trying to have a conversation with someone but they can’t hear me, etc. As these problems are solved, new ones arise. I get it, you can’t have a perfect app, so I continue to deal as I mainly use this to communicate in my LDR. "
12,aaliyahds,"July 12, 2018",1,"Get rid of integrated calling! I’ve been using this app for years and despite numerous issues with this app, the new and current frustration that’s so irritating I must leave a review about it is the forced integrated calling. I do not want skype calls in my iphone 7’s phone log. I am beyond angered that if I so much as shut my screen off, the call hangs up because it’s functioning like a phone call rather than a skype call. I hate that it makes two apps open: the skype app and the phone app. Both are simultaneously running because of the integrated calling. And both act as separate apps! I can mute a call on the skype app, yet it’s unmuted on the phone app. I can take a call off speaker in one app, but it’s on speaker in the other???"
13,Anotaze,"July 26, 2018",1,Skype has gotten worse My boyfriend and I are long distance and for over a year now we have used Skype to call every day. Skype used to be perfect and we had no issues in call. Sometimes there would be quality drops in the video but that was just due to internet connection. We could also hear the background noise and it was very loud and amplified it was hard to call with that. 
14,CreditGeek,"August 23, 2018",5,"Reliable over the yearssss I have been on Skype since 2002. For sixteen years, this has been my favorite app as it has kept up with the improvements in technology. Over the past years, I have been on international trips and Skype has kept me connected to my family and relatives in 3 different countries. The quality of calls has improved a lot over the years, too - sparing me from huge amounts of phone bills. However, I believe that the key is to have a decent internet connection. I am really impressed that is now being used widely both for personal and business communications. I have had lots of job interviews through call conferences. Love the emojis as they also keep up with the times, i.e., diversity. I can actually choose the color of the skin of the clapping hands or see different options on couples. I can go on for the many ways Skype has been an essential part of my life through the years - forever loyal to you! Thanks, Skype 👏🏼🙌🏼 🍾."
15,bajanPaul,"November 11, 2018",3,"Keep the Skype Tradition I did not wish to criticize what was the very first ever communication system that I discovered saved me loads of money and had a voice quality better than my fixed line calls. It was also very simple to use. You open the app you click on contacts you click on the name of the person you want to call, video or not, and you hear that most unique calling sound and the contact answers and you do your thing. That’s how simple it was and it became a system to shout about. Somebody tried to fix perfection and now it has so many fixes that it has become imperfect. A step downwards. Now I am one million present sure that it is not the intention of the programmers or any Skype staff or member to see this downward motion in the eyes of so many of its faith clients. So my long time friends at Skype do some more listening to the many reviews that so many people already took much of their time and energy to write. Keep it simple, easy to use by the nerds and my grandparents."
16,Opress,"January 8, 2019",1,Skype is.... Skype was pretty good before they had all of these updates. If you have a tech guy who knows how to fix bugs and the problems I shouldn’t have to write a nasty review about this problem. Sometimes I can’t see on the video call the other people when I try to call them or when someone calls me I can’t come back to see them. It’s only the picture and a color for the background. This shouldn’t have happen when Skype tries to update their app every 2 to 4 weeks to monthly. This is should be fixed in the first time when people complain about it. Today I had a call and the app was bad. I couldn’t see the video call. It was the picture and a color background. Also I couldn’t see the video when the other person answered the call. Fix the bugs and problem. 
17,iLuv Apps,"March 1, 2019",4,"Good app, needs more functionality Skype is a very useful and helpful service for international calling. Confusing interface.  When you click the iPhone button to tune your screen off, the Skype call terminates.  This means, unlike a regular phone call on iPhone where I turn the screen off, continue my conversation, and put the phone in my pocket with headphones all the time, the Skype app will automatically hang up on whomever I’m talking to.  This is especially obnoxious with international customer service phone calls where I had to wait 30 minutes in a phone queue, and then accidentally hung up on the customer service rep I was talking to.  They can’t call me back of course because Skype generates those electronic web phone numbers, which are not associated with anyone’s device, and so I’m screwed.  Please change this feature, Skype!  Make the app continue the phone call when an iPhone user clicks the power button to sleep their screen."
18,TheOneWhoKnew,"September 1, 2019",3,"Good but not reliable Been a good choice for the many years I’ve used Skype to talk with friends and for business call. Clear connection sound, versatile chat, group calls, group chats, etc. do recommend for people needing any type of free voice app or for group calls. But I’m always having problems with Skype. Everytime I update it, it creates a new problem that disables it from being reliable. Maybe it gets fixed or not but seems best for me to never update it. I once waited for maybe 10 updates or so and never had any problems. Then finally updated it because I got a new phone. Ever since updating has only caused me more problems. Maybe not the case for everyone but I wish I never updated from the obviously stable version I had. "
19,Fix direct.ly,"February 24, 2020",4,"Please stop I’ve been using Skype for years, mainly because it’s better than FaceTime and Snapchat when it comes to just calling, but for the love of god, please stop showing me the would you like to respond or whatever it’s called when my call doesn’t go through or the someone I’m trying to call doesn’t pick up or whatever the case may be. If I’m going to respond I’ll just do it in the chat, I don’t need you to pull up some auto response of “please give me a call back.” Or whatever it says, the reason I’m writing this is mainly due to the fact of this feature deleting the text I had there with the “please give me a call back,” text. I spent a good 30-45 minutes writing a message to my girlfriend just to have it disappear. It’s a bad feature, and I hope to see it be removed or at least give us the option to turn it off. (there is no way that I know of to turn it off)"
20,TyrantZEG,"April 1, 2018",1,"Very cumbersome accessing contacts I don’t know what Microsoft is thinking but the current Skype app on iOS is the most useless one ever. It is an extremely difficult task finding a number on your contact list and using Skype to call that number. First, no matter how hard you try, your iPhone contacts simply don’t show on Skype, giving Skype access to your contacts doesn’t change this. If this is a phone calling app amongst other things, shouldn’t this be a basic feature? Secondly, even if you copy a number and paste in the dial pad, it automatically deletes the “+” sign (if you have saved contacts in international format). There is no way to edit the pasted number from dial pad to add the plus sign back so you always have to manually write down a number to call it using Skype!!! Please Microsoft, test your own products for ease of use. This is the most annoying Skype app ever. If people are buying Skype credit, is because they want to use the phone features; make it usable. PLEASE!"
21,Promiceus,"May 30, 2018",5,"Reality is good! There are a lot of things going on around Skype. Some people say that they prefer old interface. Other’s remember old bugs. But reality is way better. Most of the old bugs are squashed. Skype actually works better than before these days. New looks... why they supposed to keep old interface for ages? Kid is a changing. New changes may not be to everyone’s taste, but they are not that bad if you give them a chance. Dark mode, reactions and stuff - they make Skype look modern and up to date. "
22,distediste,"July 4, 2018",1,I hate it now I used skype almost 13 years. Last couple of years it started to be very difficult to use. When you open a new account it wants your microsoft account if you don’t have a microsoft account you can not open an account. Also now Skype wants all of your phone contacts to sync with your skype account which is not necessary. I do not want all my contacts in my skype account anyways. It was really easy to use before but now it is not easy. When you want to close your account they are not closing it immediately!! I have to wait 60 days???!!
23,Anon in Cyan,"August 14, 2018",4,"Great! But.. I’ve been a long time Skype user. And honestly, its great! I’ve been able to keep in touch with my friend after the social media site we used to frequent shut down. This app has everything we need: a call session with the option to turn on the camera, ability to send pictures and chat, and the ability to quote chat bubbles to make fun of each other’s typos! "
24,Chudaka_pi,"November 3, 2018",1,"Skype app freezing and crashing on new iPhones. The Skype app for iPhone has gone from not so user friendly as the classic fast simple app which we all loved to right out useless. Attempting to create a new Skype account using the app sends to some blank Microsoft screens and frozen message screens. Specifically the iPhone X. The product has been undergoing some champagnes since the acquisition by Microsoft but on the user side these have manifested as consistent poor results: confusing screens and services, missing or hard to manage features, and now just plain not functional. I’m forced to migrate video calls to FaceTime or WhatsApp or Viber. For a respectable tech company, this is a failure on the backend integration, front end design, and services side. While it was working, the only thing I think remained fairly decent was the video quality. But so is the quality of all the other apps! Microsoft, get that team’s act together and rebuild the app to be simple and functional so the majority of users do not depart to all the other mean and functional alternatives!"
25,BellaRedMoon,"November 7, 2018",4,"Overall good but needs improvement As someone in a long distance relationship, I depend heavily on video calling. Quality of Skype calls are pretty good and I like the ability to use Skype on any device. That being said, my boyfriend is Deaf and we use ASL to communicate. I don’t need the notifications saying “people are having trouble hearing you. Try moving closer to the microphone or eliminate background noise.” I understand that I’m getting this because it’s not picking up sound from my end, but I can promise doing those things won’t help so I’d appreciate not getting constant reminders. I’ve also been recently struggling with the little box that’s supposed to show me just shows black. The other person can see me fine, but I can’t see myself. This makes it very difficult to make sure I’m always on screen and able to be seen."
26,BYM35145664,"December 23, 2018",2,"So close Unless someone refuses to use, or doesn’t have, Skype then this is basically my sole app for calling anyone. I really do want to like this app more, but for mobile there is, at least in my case, one MAJOR drawback. The notifications are broken. It’s not that they never work (because then it would likely be a case of them simply being off). For other apps with messaging typically each new message prompts a notification, but with Skype it seems I only get one notification for the first message and then no new notifications from that person until I check the messages. Also, there have been many instances where I get a banner notification but no red icon on the app. So for example if the message came while I was sleeping but gets pushed down by a host of other notifications, when I open my phone and just look for the red icons I don’t see one for Skype and assume I received no messages there. Thus Skype only becomes useful for calling. I hope this can be improved."
27,Nikolay Shpurik,"November 12, 2019",1,"Skype “Unlimited Worldwide mobiles and landline” is a scam! In iPhone app Skype “Unlimited Worldwide mobiles and landline” has no information about big limitations and exclusions of this plan, no link to more information about this plan. When you see the name you obviously think that it’s a good deal and when you click on the plan you right away invited to the purchase of this plan. But when you try you to use it you’ll find out that this particular phone line in this particular country is not covered by this plan. You contact Skype support to complain about this misinformation and they will tell you contact Apple because your transaction was through the iTunes account. Apple will send you back to developer to chase your refund. At the end, shame on you Microsoft for giving false information to the customers and putting them through all these trails to get the refund! Why can’t you be honest upfront about these subscriptions and tell customers that your “Unlimited Worldwide“ subscription is in fact is very limited and absolutely not worldwide?"
28,Kirasan223,"April 23, 2020",4,"Skype is Amazing but... Look I love this app for the phone, and for the computer and well all platforms. Although, I must admit the quality on some devices is not as good as others. So for instance, I talk to many people in other countries and sometimes their computers are better to hear and see them from while other times their phones. "
29,Adriana04,"October 9, 2019",1,"I wish I didn’t have to use it This is probably the only social app that actually ruins relationships instead of bringing people closer like it was originally designed to. Why is there no way to turn off showing my status and when I am online? All other apps got away with that by now. Choosing to stay ‘invisible’ just doesn’t work and the app automatically shows me online at random times, like when it’s 4am in the morning for me and I am sleeping! And my contacts from other parts of the world think I am online and start calling me and then it looks like I am ignoring their calls. And when I am on a call, it also shows me as online and other people start calling and then think I am just ignoring them. I am tired of apologizing for nothing. The only solution I found is to sign out all the time but then I miss the messages I get. It just doesn’t have to be this complicated. I really wish I didn’t have to use it but some of my older contacts still use it so I’ll wait it out."
30,EknineEd1385,"March 3, 2018",3,"Annoying Long time user of Skype here. As stated already, the UI is horribly unintuitive and difficult to navigate. Nothing about it is organized properly. But aside from all of that, the one major feature that annoys the absolute hell out of me is the fact that the power button sometimes ends the call. I’m left unable to turn off my phone’s screen unless I wait for it to time out on it’s own. Even if I’m in a completely different app, it STILL causes Skype calls to end when I push the power button. It simply should not do this, I’m more than capable of choosing one of the more conventional methods of ending calls, such as the “end call” button on screen. The other thing is, it DOESN’T always do this. Sometimes it simply turns of my phone’s screen as it should. It makes no sense. This is very frustrating, please consider revising this."
31,Manukaiuli,"March 22, 2018",4,"Don’t join social video chats, rise above them! I would easily have given you 5 stars, but all the emojis and filters are so unnecessary!  I would like to see you guys put your efforts into making  your service work flawlessly, rather than adding all the silly little frills—leave that to Snapchat, Instagram and the social playground apps.   Just provide a rock solid, dependable, user friendly video call service!  Instead of striving to keep up with all the other social venues out there, strive to rise above and be the best.   Be the ONE people use for those really important video calls where every minute must be dependably perfect—such as the call we are expecting from our son’s out of state doctor.  Our son can’t travel 400 miles, so we depend on video call Dr. appointments.  Be the best!"
32,Dana Ervin,"August 5, 2018",3,"Skype: No Longer True to the Original Purpose. I have been involved in a long-distance relationship for nearly two years now, and in the beginning Skype was a saving grace. However, throughout my relationship, Skype has become more and more of a nuisance with their new features and how they push them. I wish they would stop trying to be Snapchat with their new “Highlights” feature. If I wanted to use Snapchat or Instagram like features- I would use Snapchat or Instagram. "
33,Bulbagirl,"February 2, 2019",1,"Needs fixing I use Skype everyday to text and call my boyfriend since we have a long distance relationship. During texting the keyboard sometimes goes over the message area and I can’t see what I’m texting. Sometimes the whole screen glitches and goes upside down. Messages don’t always send right away as well. Don’t always get notifications of new messages. Sometimes the whole screen goes black and closes out or stays black for a while. When we call the quality isn’t well, very block like. Loses signal a lot or randomly ends calls. Sometimes he doesn’t even get my calls. Freezes once in a while. If these things could be fixed that would be wonderful."
34,Nana@51,"February 19, 2019",3,"Status seldom indicates “Active” This happens nearly everyday. I go to chat, and the receiving end “Status” indicates that they haven’t been seen for days. Even though I may have just messaged back and forth an hour ago. But that’s not all! That person doesn’t get my messages at all. He checks his laptop skype, his Apple iPad skype, and his iPhone skype. Most of the time, he won’t see any messages. Then suddenly! He will get all the messages on his phone. But not every time. He logs off on all devices, then back on. He restarts all of his devices. Sometimes the status turns to “Active” and he begins to receive messages, other times, not."
35,Anyabagui,"May 13, 2019",3,"Full of bugs Iconic app, million people cant say no to it. But why everything that Microsoft touches becomes buggy and impossible to use? It was never ideal and perfect, but it WORKED. Now, you cannot rely on it. Feature that i use a lot is calling city numbers through skype. Adding credits since microsoft bought the app is a nightmare. The purchase goes through but credit might not show up forever. Trying to make a call, singing out and in , all the things that google suggest - nothing works. It used to be instant. "
36,38 K,"May 31, 2019",4,"Skype calls My family and I live in different countries and use Skype for calls regularly.  I also use a Skype phone number that they can call me on.  I get annoyed with the app when I go to make a call to their land line and it gives me a drop down menu choice each time that says “Skype credit” or “get Skype credit”.  If I go to redial, it reverses the order of these on the drop down menu so you must be extra careful that you don’t hit the wrong button to pay to get more credit if you don’t need it then.  I wish it was the same each time- please make it simple.  It’s annoying!!!  Other than that issue , I find it to work fine and quality of the calls via the land lines or video is usually good. It’s a great way to be able to stay in touch."
37,travelingargentine,"September 30, 2019",4,"Love Skype, But a “New” Skype ID Popped Up with New Laptop Love Skype!  I have a US/Canada subscription, a Skype number, Skype Credit, and Contacts under my long-standing Skype ID.  But when I recently got a new laptop, it came with my Microsoft ID/email address filled in, not my Skype ID—which I didn’t catch right away.  So I wondered where my subscription, number, credit, and contacts had disappeared to!?!  That was sneaky of Microsoft to automatically fill in my Microsoft ID, when my Skype ID had everything tied to it.  A friend had the same issue, but realized too late that he ended up with two Skype accounts and added credit and a subscription renewal to the “wrong” ID.  Plus, he got calls, messages, and texts at both IDs, but saw them only if he happened to be on the right device—new laptop or old iPod touch.  Please fix!!"
38,KiddissKat,"September 10, 2019",5,"It’s better than I expected 👍 I have known about Skype for many years, but refused to use it because I don’t do video chats. Now that I know that I can do voice-only chats, I use it all the time to talk with friends in other countries."
39,NenaCH,"December 5, 2019",5,"Great for cell to land line calls I have used Skype for over 15 years and it has improved a lot. However, it is not always reliable if the connection slows down. Most times it works well and because I use it from my internet enabled cell phone to a land line, the prices are way much cheaper than any cell phone service around the world! One thing I really do not understand is the ringing when you are placing a call: sometimes it rings like a phone and sometimes it has a music ring and it is hard to understand if the system made or not the connection as sometimes the call goes through and other it does not! "
40,Al707,"March 4, 2018",2,"Barely useful now for me Yes, I can make a call, yes I have a Skype number, but the single feature that made Skype worth it for me was ‘Auto Answer’. You could have Skype auto answer, and decide who it would auto answer to. This allowed me to connect with home, video or audio, without the need for someone to answer. A very useful feature. Now Skype is a big ho him, voip, ok, just another phone thing. I’m not sure I have a compelling use for it anymore. I hope they reconsider a very bad decision, and stop giving us less features. It was a wonderful, useful program, now ..... not so much. If I keep it, I’ll go back to the free stuff. No point in paying for fair to mediocre. Did I mention the new interface makes little or no sense? I wonder who was able to come up with so many poor concepts, and produce something so inferior to the original version. And why?"
41,qquintt,"April 11, 2018",5,"Satisfying performance, comments on interface This version of Skype has performed very very reliably for me for my needs, which include international collaborations and making travel arrangements in distant countries.  "

43,Codaylllll,"April 27, 2018",1,"If you are listening, stop doing what you are doing Unfortunately, due to discord becoming incredibly better than Skype these last few months, the problem isn't the the GUI, and, settings change and the new layout, even though this is stupid and it should revert back to its normal state, the problem is Discord is just doing everything you do, but better. They don't change their layout drastically and whenever they make a pathetic update, they revert back because the community asked. They also own up to their mistakes. If you truly want to become a successful business again, revert to the original easy to use, not limited layout. And also... try to do BETTER than Discord. I know none of this will be listened to. But for anyone reading this. This would save Skype from becoming irrelevant and would at least keep some users from switching to the better service."

45,Husky0103,"July 11, 2018",5,"Call to Nigeria Voice call with recipient in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. Due to broadband limitations on the receiving end this call was quickly switched from video to voice only, although it began in video mode successfully. In this mode it went forward with a clear connection and with essentially no delay. It’d be hard to classify quality as anything but excellent. I’d prefer to be able to route the conversation through the speaker function on this iPhone 8, and still have the use of my Bluetooth connected hearing aids, which may be as simple as disabling Bluetooth prior to initiating the call. This would allow others on my side to hear the  responses from the called end."
46,SSBebe,"February 8, 2019",5,Lifesaver Skype has been a lifesaver for me. I a civilian on orders internationally and when I got a new phone number realized I couldn’t make any U.S. calls. That was a problem as most of those calls were to 800 numbers for various bills and other issues. Not to mention being able to call my grandma and one friend who is still determined to own a flip phone. I have only used it maybe a dozen times but it saved me being able to make those calls. So far so good. Not to mention half of the U.S. stuff like credit cards require a phone number for online access. I can at least give them my Skype number as for some reason they haven’t figured out how to allow international numbers.
47,laya.,"May 21, 2019",2,"FIX. OMG. this is so frustrating at this point. skype was such a comfortable app that I have been using on desktop and phone. Desktop is fine, but suddenly on mobile (maybe 2 months ago), every time I switch apps after having turned my camera on during call, the camera will come on temporarily when I come back to the app and shut off after about 8seconds. The only solution is ending the call and starting again. This is so inconvenient and if the other party is sleeping or away from the phone they can’t even pick up the call. I wish this problem would be fixed. I wish all of these apps would realize when they’re ahead and just stop changing everything. Skype is plenty comfortable the way it is, and with every update it’s becoming less and less convenient. Please fix this problem."
48,John Henin,"March 14, 2020",2,"Lots of Troubles First of all the app is very easy to use, and most of the time the voice is loud and clear. Other than that, I'm facing lots of troubles with it. First, if you're searching for a contact in your address book you would find lots of other Skype contacts, you didn't even hear about, and then after a couple of seconds you might find the one you're looking for among them, or you might fail from the first time and you have to do it again."
49,CaliforniaTraveler2019,"September 15, 2019",4,"Good but recent problems Used Skype for more than 15 years, and was getting better and better, until recently there is a problem when trying to turn in Speaker after receiving a call. Then new user interface has a time delay when in a call so one must touch screen and then the speaker icon quickly appears but does not allow to be pressed! It sometimes needs to be pressed more than 10 times to be activated and this can take a few minutes of waiting for you and the person calling. This problem does not exist on any other apps. I hope Skype fixes this, if they do I will write another review because I like many things about Skype, especially the black theme and user ID instead of phone number login."
