Tried another email thinking I used a different one. Nope. Tried resetting password and it doesn't recognize the email. I enter my phone number and it tells me I already have an account. What the hell is going on? I'm beyond frustrated and apparently lost my points I earned. I'm pissed.

Tried every password combo imaginable. Tried password recovery and the app shows an error saying ""enter valid email"". Went to the spendgo site, same problem. Tried using my points in-store with my phone number and they get an error saying I ""have not completed registration""... Try to register on the spendgo site and it says my number is already registered. No contact info on the spendgo site. Idk what else to try. gg goodcents, you got me. What a rip off"
2,Zac Duggan,"January 31, 2020",1," Limited options to edit selections. If you typo your card info it will not tell you so, just that there's an ambiguous error and to try again later. By the time I figured out that it was an expression date error and fixed it, the app had locked me out with no specific reason why."
3,Sasha Welch,"February 15, 2020",1," Got the updated app and I was able to sign in. It there is no way to actually order food? And after trying to figure it out I now can't get back in.

And after trying to figure it out I now can't get back in. Please revert the app back or do a major update as the app has literally no purpose. I can see my profile, Points, Activity, and a description of the Penny Club but can't order delicious sandwiches. :("
4,Jessica H,"March 20, 2020",4," The new update made it a little difficult. You have to reset your password in order to access your account again. It was a pop up Instruction on the app after the update. Once this is complete the app works perfectly, I was able to order online and it had all my reward points."
5,Kory Duff,"January 30, 2020",1, I was told to reinstall the application because they switched to a new provider or something along those lines the points on my app where showing 9.44 and in the store they said I only had 160 but a quick reinstall would fix everything but now it tells me my number is taken and password recovery wil...Full ReviewI was told to reinstall the application because they switched to a new provider or something along those lines the points on my app where showing 9.44 and in the store they said I only had 160 but a quick reinstall would fix everything but now it tells me my number is taken and password recovery will not work because my email that's registered to literally everything I have is some how not registered to this app any more very bad app host/provider
6,caleigh410,"February 24, 2020",1," The old app was great! Why are my points no longer showing since I updated the app. Also i noticed that the new app sells your information, WHY??? I want the old app back."
7,John Michael,"February 8, 2020",1," The developers got rid of the ""pay at store"" option, so it forces you to enter your card info. No thanks"
8,FOZ,"February 11, 2020",1," POS...had to uninstall my app to install new version, now I can't log in at all. Beyond frustrated!!"
9,Sam Johnson,"February 15, 2020",1," I loved the app, I updated it and now I can't log in i can't do anything on the app."
10,Ariel Paul Melin,"March 6, 2020",1," Worthless app. Ever since the last update, I am unable to log in and it doesn't recognize me."
11,David Petro,"February 21, 2020",1," You might want to tell your customers that they need to install the app in order to get points. I was told points were accumulating on my phone number everytime I placed an order. I've been to your store dozens of times before downloading the app, and I have zero points."
12,Kat Zapp,"April 4, 2020",5, Super easy to use! Love it and Good cents food is always delicious 😋
13,tod william,"February 12, 2020",1, Not user friendly. Old app was better. The collection of personal information in the user agreement seems shady. If it wasn't for helping my father with his order I would never use this app.
14,David Sanford,"March 1, 2020",1," By now your company has realized that the update has severely damaged the online ordering base of your customers.

I could say what everyone else is pointing out about the new app/update; however, I'll simply state that your company is about to lose a lot of loyal customers because you didn't test the update rollout and you're about to provide (sell) customers personal information to other companies. Sometimes it's better to be loyal to people who are making your business a success. Fix the App."
15,Christina Baker,"February 4, 2020",1, There is no way to check your rewards points without starting an order. This is a bad design.
16,Dustin Hutchinson,"March 31, 2020",5, Simple functioning and it gets the job done!
17,Barbara Collins,"February 21, 2020",1, Had to reinstall and now it won't let me in.
18,Chelsea Allen,"March 5, 2020",1," The new app, and even online, is a big no go for me now so I wont be using the new app and I won't be signing in online.

However I do see you can still use your number at the stores to earn and redeem rewards which is helpful. It just sucks I can't order from an app anymore or know what rewards I could have, I guess no more free birthday sub. >_>"
19,A Google user,"March 19, 2020",1," I get a message telling me to update, but it wont let me??

I can't log in and now am unable to use the app to order sandwiches and I'm pissed because I had over $30 in my reward points. I will no longer go to goodcents because they have taken away the use of this app and it can't be updated. I guess goodcents doesn't care about losing customers! The app is now worthless....plus loosing over $30 in reward points. GOOD JOB GOODCENTS"
20,Travis Corbin,"April 13, 2020",5, Always easy to navigate. Given the current circumstance it's a life saver for our house being able to order meat and bread. It's far cheaper and better quality. Thanks!
21,Lisa Kenny,"February 23, 2020",1," New app is HORRIBLE! Won't allow me to log into my acct and keeps telling me my email is invalid, but won't allow me to create a new account because my#and email are already registered."
22,Brian St.John,"February 24, 2020",1, New app has disagreable data sharing policies. I ordered my food as a guest and won't be using Mr.Goodcents nearly as often as I once did. That's a shame. I'm a big fan.
23,Dustin Lineweber,"February 7, 2020",1," Says an update is needed, but no updates are published to Google play. Developer must have screwed up the rollout. As we do."
24,Karissa Tarlowski,"February 26, 2020",1," Trash app. No actual update available on the app store, reset password option makes you agree to personal info being pimped out to god knows who. Goodcents screwed the pooch on this one, and I've lost all my loyalty points."
25,kerry brown,"February 9, 2020",2, Love the app. However when it comes time to do an app up grade your completely locked out of using your points until you completely abide by the up grade.
26,Carol R,"March 2, 2020",1," Worked great until the update. Now i can't log in, even after resetting my password."
27,Matthew Rasmussen,"April 17, 2020",1, App does not work. Cannot get an order in because of a big constantly asking to upgrade there version when no upgrade is available.
28,Zena Bena,"March 28, 2020",5, New app is so much easier than the old one. Sandwiches are always good! Hi
29,Tyler Blank,"February 17, 2020",1, Doesn't work anymore. Wants me to download a new app I can't find. Has like 50+ popups telling me to do that with a link I can't click.
30,Jeremy King,"March 1, 2020",1," Will NOT use the new app. They are using a company that sells your info. No thanks. Sorry goodcents, you lost a loyal customer. Hit me up when you change it back and maybe I'll come back. Too many sub shops to use one that wants to sell my name number and address to others"
31,Chris,"March 17, 2020",1," App login no longer works. Takes you to an external website that fails to connect due to ""unknown protocol."""
32,John Standridge,"February 3, 2020",3, Normally great app. Cannot find vendor currently and will not allow me to report problem. Will be a 5 star app when rectified.
33,Peter Hubenett,"February 12, 2020",1," Lost my reward points with newest version and it won't let me log in, say to update when I already have and have reinstalled the app. What happened?"
34,Josh Nethery,"February 13, 2020",1, No way to find rewards in the new app. Made me reset my password. Horrible migration and trash app. Uninstalling as this is useless now for me.
35,Jake Young,"January 22, 2020",4," It's pretty good. It does what you'd expect. I'd really like the option to select ""lite"" or ""easy"" on things like condiments. Another area for improvement is including real-time delivery alerts."
36,Randall Eaton,"March 4, 2020",1, Makes you look in to different web based app. Down not make sense. Old app much better.
37,Jen,"March 13, 2020",1, Keeps telling me to update the app and get the latest version but goes straight to the one I already have.
38,Chris Johnson,"February 21, 2020",1, Doesn't work. Doesn't recognize the store that is less than 2 miles from my house. Have to agree to let app provider give my information to all sorts of different businesses.
39,Tony Amelio,"February 13, 2020",1," The Goodscents company is no longer a client of theirs. I had issues logging in, so I emailed them and that is what the told me. Along with you should uninstal the app because it is no longer any use to me."
40,Inderpal Bains,"October 21, 2019",4," The app is good, nice and simple. BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER THE APP IS ADEQUATE AND NEEDS NOTHING Else, but it would be nice if you could start a custom sub instead of having to choose one of the options and adjusting it to your liking.

BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER THE APP IS ADEQUATE AND NEEDS NOTHING Else, but it would be nice if you could start a custom sub instead of having to choose one of the options and adjusting it to your liking. For example I get a BLT and there is no BLT option or custom option so I end up modifying the veggie one. It doesn't bother me much especially since the App saves your orders so it's easier the next time around, however it just makes sense to have a custom one."
41,Shirley Mitchell,"March 17, 2020",1, App keeps saying I need to upgrade n won't let me do anything. This is ever since I updated it.
42,Bobby Zink,"April 7, 2020",2," When I open the app, it says it's needs to be updated (or upgraded). I come here and there is no update option."
43,casey keck,"April 22, 2020",1, The app keeps saying it's out of date but there are no updates in the Google Play Store.
44,BLoves J,"February 14, 2019",3, Works well for ordering but could use some work as far as accuracy of what's available at each location and convenience when it comes to getting points for what you've ordered. You should be able to scan your receipts to get points as well.
45,Korinda Bizek,"October 8, 2018",4, The app was fine except when you went to put in special request every time you hit the button and it kept pushing you out and wouldn't let you make any special requests. It did let you do it at the end but not where you wanted to for each item.
46,Jason Holmes,"January 4, 2020",5, This app is fantastic. The rewards program is the simplest and most rewarding that I've ever used. I love the new Goodcents sandwiches.
47,Egoless Mortal,"June 21, 2019",5," To me this is a GREAT app! I have only ever navigated the app and havent used it to order anything yet.

I love that my In-store purchases count towards my points, the convince to place an order any time makes me smile. I have no idea why people down vote this app. The food is great the, the app is easy to use. 10/10 in my book."
48,Melissa McClure,"February 28, 2019",3," I'm having problems with the app not transmitting my full order to the store yet charging me the price for the full order. my app history has all items, the store ticket they fill the order from does not. yet the total charged is the full order total on their ticket, though an item is missing."
49,James_wingthwong_ Banks,"November 13, 2018",5, Always have loved Goodcents over all the other sandwich shops. Prices are cheaper. Food is fresher. App is easy to navigate. You get 10% reward directly for food orders. You can also add notes about each order.
50,Kory,"December 7, 2018",5," Great app to order goodcents! The response of each screen is nice, choosing your toppings and sandwich are easy, and scanning your card at checkout is helpful. Love the rewards program, too!"
51,A Google user,"November 24, 2018",4," Fast and easy to use. Needs more detail on little things like how many ounces are in a cup vs. a bowl of soup. Overall great savings, and convenient for quick service."
52,Jack,"December 18, 2019",5, Only used it a few times so far but it is simple and has a clean interface.
53,Bridgette Foerster,"March 10, 2019",5, Always easy to use. Love how easy it is to go back and change things. Super simple makes it super user friendly. Makes placing an order very convenient!
54,Shiraz Sheikh,"March 2, 2020",1, Can't see my points anymore. Just shows that I can order after updating and logging in.
55,Michelle Carroll,"May 24, 2019",4, app is great but Mr Goodcents where I live their machine didn't take my rewards nor did it do it last time they're having some type of problem with it and im sad wont let me add my birthday keeps saying I need a 10 number and my cell number is 10 digets
56,K Black,"June 6, 2019",1," Terrible app! Originally, I could place a takeout order and pay with gift card or cash when I arrived. Now the only option is a credit card which I don't use."
57,Rob Ram,"December 26, 2018",4, The app is nice and easy to navigate. Need to have other options listed (with prices) when adding other ingredients.
58,Judy Waddell,"September 19, 2019",3, Took awhile to figure out how to delete an item in the cart. It took a process of trying different things as there was no where that it explained how to do it....you had to press down and hold on items to delete.
59,John Hufford,"January 24, 2019",4," The app is pretty good, the biggest issue is the lack of customization allowed when building your sandwhich if they fixed this it would be the best sandwich phone app."
60,Andria Jeffries,"September 15, 2019",3," One big flaw: cannot enter gift cards for payment, and you must play through the app, so you can't use them to pay when you pick up."
61,BootsDocs andConspiracies,"January 19, 2020",2, App in very slow loading. Terrible has been timrs rakes ovet a hour to load. Plus tge rewards program free birthday sub just changed from have 30 days to kt it to niw only 4 days why??
62,Jacob Cambridge,"May 9, 2019",3," Very slow interface! Could be more intuitive. But does the job, eventually."
63,jesus gonzolez,"March 20, 2020",1, Was told I had to update and change my password to order food. Why would I go through all that for something I use once every other month. Don't make it hard for me to order or I won't.
64,Duck8887,"April 7, 2020",1, Ordered from the app and the time for it to be ready kept changing and they ran out of wheat bread before 5pm. How the freak do you run out of a main bread you serve.

How the freak do you run out of a main bread you serve. I wanted wheat because it's less fattening and I had to freaking settle for white bread. Never again will I be ordering from noland roads location again.
65,Susan Klingenberg,"October 8, 2019",4," Like being able to order exactly what I want on the sandwiches, but I wish it would give you the choice of drink and chips OR drink and cookie before you get to the check out."
66,Sherie Donnelly,"March 18, 2020",1," Every since the last upgrade, I can't get in to order. It is a worthless app now. Go back to what you had. Until then, I'll go elsewhere."
67,Gabby Santos,"January 30, 2019",5," Very simple to use. Only complaint would be this...the store I order from has Mrs.Vickys Salt & Vinegar chips, but it's not an option to select when placing an order, so I alwyas have to remember to add a note when I order."
68,Brian K,"September 11, 2019",5, The app works great after you get the initial set up completed. Save your favorite sandwich for easy ordering on the go.
69,Kaler Cook,"January 18, 2020",1," Claims that it delivers to my entire town. When the delivery option is chosen, it says i am outside of the delivery zone. I'm in the middle of town so there's a glitch for sure. Bummer, goodcents is so good!"
70,Jatia Buchholz,"April 4, 2019",5," Absolutely worth it. Love there food an Love the app. Helps me save cash on food an drinks. Soo, glad I downloaded the app."
71,b foster,"March 21, 2019",4," The app should allow you to remember a ""favorite"" location so you don't always have to choose a location off of the map for pick-up."
72,Brent Kubik,"February 3, 2020",1, Doesnt work since update on January 28!... why do you have to mess up a good thing!
73,Cassie Haas,"October 20, 2019",2," I love using the app to put the order in but there was no way to go back and change anything once I submitted it to the order, before checking out. That sucks!"
74,Joy Peek,"July 3, 2019",5, It's very easy and fast to place your order. You can find everything you need to make your sandwhich. If you want to remove something it's also easy to do that.
75,jennifer lowe,"August 18, 2019",5, I love the app but I wish they would put a additional button for pepperoni! you cant add pepperoni to your sandwiches! but other then that the app is amazing
76,Veronica Mittenfelner,"September 15, 2018",1, This app sucks. I have tried numerous times to download and install.....it will not. It will not allow me to troubleshoot either.
77,Amy L,"November 7, 2018",5," Love it! Everything works, it's super easy and convenient."

84,Preston West,"October 1, 2019",5," Gets the job done, very easy to navigate through options."
85,Gregg Bates,"March 7, 2019",2, I like GC but disappointed in the app. Really wanted nutritional information but it cannot be accessed through the app.
86,Frank H,"February 24, 2019",1," Didn't apply rewards balance to order. Can't customize a sandwich such as tomato only on half, can't use Google pay, ordering through app shouldn't be the only way to get rewards."

93,Scott Sterling,"November 21, 2018",5, Love this app. Saves you money and easy to order.
94,Liz Syrigos,"January 29, 2019",3," you have to watch the time and date that you select to pick up, it keeps changing it back to the defauled time and date"
95,Jeff Smith,"February 14, 2019",4," works good, wish I could order just a cookie and not have order a drink with it. otherwise would be 5 stars."
96,Rachel Thiele,"August 20, 2019",5, It's so easy to use and my food is always ready when I get there. They are always busy but no waiting in line for me!

There were minor issues - like it insisted that I enter my birthday but only offered 6 months to choose from!?? Weird. The reason I deducted a star from this otherwise perfect experience was due to the delivery time option. I was so happy to see that I could select the time for my order to be delivered (so it would arrive right before my company). However, my delivery arrived 25 minutes before my selected time - leading me to believe that they didn't even notice the order had a later delivery time. On the receipt - the requested delivery time was in HUGE bold print! If they are going to offer this option, they need to provide it. Otherwise, seriously great app and service!"
349,David Dotson,"April 14, 2017",1," Have to enter a valid credit card just to use this app, even if you have enough reward points to not require one. Slow, constantly reminds you to turn on location services that aren't required."

Was very discouraging as I had plenty of points for my family and I to get a free meal and when I asked the cashier he said only on online orders even though the app says use your points at anytime.  Makes no sense!"
351,Andrew Guthrie,"May 31, 2017",1, This app is kind of jankey. The ordering page is outdated and very basic. The real problem is that after you place an order there is not way to track it. There is no.way to even verify the order has been submitted or received by the store.
352,Erik D15,"June 8, 2017",3, It doesn't have all of the choices.. like the pepper bread or sea salt & vinegar chips etc...
353,A Google user,"April 13, 2017",3, App was great until this last update...WHY does it need access to my camera!  Will be deleting the app.

When I first joined,  it took forever for my points to be added.  Every time I go into the store, I always ask how I can redeem my points  (which states can be redeemed at any time), the employees keep telling me they know nothing about it,  they've received training,  etc and this is the same response I get since I signed up over 3 months ago. Why is it a rewards app when you can't redeem rewards and the employees know nothing about it?"

It would be much better if I could order in the shop and then just scan something on the app to add my points. And where's the dine in option? All my subs are wrapped to go now thanks to only being able to order take out. Also, the rate at which you earn a free sub is ridiculous compared to the cards.
