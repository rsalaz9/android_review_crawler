The adds are deceptively hidden as sponsored content sprinkled in with the real content, but honestly(small print honestly) labled as such. No flashing adds is great. All in all what you'd expect from a top teir software company."

News content is pretty awesome, they have lots of topics for you to get news on so you don't keep watching similar news daily. But the biggest fault is of widget, I mean I am still trying to figure out may be Microsoft has just putted widget on trial basis, it really sucks and very bad, fonts, content I mean everything. So if you guys like widget then don't go for this"
3,John L. Mooney,"April 15, 2020",4," I love the options this gives you. I like the compact mode that I used to see in the older, now defunct Google News app that Google replaced.

I like the compact mode that I used to see in the older, now defunct Google News app that Google replaced. The news I read here gets straight to the point, leaving out all of the nonsense. I like that. You are given a veriety of subjects to choose from for your news preferences. The ability to choose between light and dark mode is a nice touch. I like this alot better than the Smart News app which I uninstalled. Microsoft's News so much better!"
4,Joey Dixon,"April 22, 2020",5," This is probably the best news app I've seen yet.

6,Jay Hardy,"April 12, 2020",2," In the last few months, especially since the epidemic, the large majority of the photos in the news have nothing to do with the stories - some photos repeated over and over, some cropped from larger images at odd angles, either that or totally wrong.

Seems to be less ads on MS News and access to publications that usually have a pay wall. What i would like to see is a way to mute certain sources like Fox and to be able to fine tune what i do and don't see on a more granular level than just the broad categories available. Layout is decent and way more consistent than Flipboard. So far so good üëç

Its slow even on LTE. Frustrated. Uninstalling. That second star for good content. You deserve it.
10,Mark P,"April 22, 2020",2," Newly added pain: subtitle to images cannot be hidden?!? Image zooming is a disaster: it doesn't zoom or in small jiggery steps. Videos play poorly, they often stop half way while the sound continues. Hidden sponsored articles are annoying. Generally a little sluggish."
11,Murthy DS,"April 18, 2020",2, Outdated news! The app does not show the latest news. It keeps showing outdated news that is sometimes a week or more old. There are many other problems that I dont want to list. The layout is good. But what is the use when the content is useless?
12,Sean Noonan,"April 9, 2020",5," Very pleasant user interface and bugs that I have experienced have since been bashed.

Dark mode is my favorite and it is so elegantly incorporated to this app across the platforms it's available on. If you're a Microsoft fan or just looking to detox from the televised news, you have to see the news through this app."

Please add a system default mode along with Light, Dark modes so that it will change automatically based on time (Day/Night). And please make good looking dark colour instead of pure black colour for night mode. Will change rating as I use the app."
14,jUSTIN nOPE,"April 19, 2020",2," The headlines that appear in the ""top story"" notifications on my phone do not correspond with the stories that appear in any of the sections when I open the app. There is also a lot of gossipy trash mixed in with few ways of opting out."
15,Robert Shoemaker,"April 4, 2020",1," App worked great before the upgrade recently. Now crashes every time try to open an article to read. Do you not beta test this trash before you push it out the door to meet some quota? The software technicians that create ""upgrades"" need to take a long vacation or retire."
16,G L,"April 11, 2020",1," Like many other users, the app keeps crashing when an article is selected and is very slow to load. I've tried the beta and the stable versions they both do the same. The app worked fine on my note 10+ but not on my new S20 ultra. Uninstall/reinstalled but no joy!"
17,Devjeet Singh Rathor,"April 15, 2020",5," I have used many news app and still using them but thing I liked the most is ""one-tap search"" of word. This helps to get meanings of new words. This feature can be seen on crome browser."
18,DeVant√© Shay,"April 24, 2020",5, I love this app for I've been with Microsoft for along time for many years. Also they provide great details about what is going on especially in the midst of Covid 19.
19,Yash Vardhan Mittal,"April 13, 2020",5, Best news app in these times. It gives you quality and unbiased journalism from the News Agencies across the globe and it is Ad free and its UI is fluid and smooth to the benchmark. Great! Kudos to the developers and the team behind.
20,Tanvir Ahmad Arjel,"April 15, 2020",1," Home page take too much time to load on android. Sometimes even it does not load. Please fix this. Moreover, app is not well smooth and responsive. Please take a look onto it. Rating will updated if these issues are fixed."
21,Simon Roberts,"April 16, 2020",3, It gives a fairly diverse spread of news from around the world but where is the option to choose your sources? Frustrated by it still offering me stories from publications I have never and would never click on. Some of the categories such as columnists are simply not updated.
22,Justin,"April 9, 2020",5, Best news app I've found! It's literally everything I've been wanting. I keep it in dark mode and compact mode. Wish I could upgrade to get rid of the ads! Either way it's still awesome!
23,Arnaud Long,"April 24, 2020",1," Very good news selection, but extremely slow to open each article... Crash often, especially when opening from recent app... Google news is working perfectly fine, and my phone is an OnePlus 7 pro..."
24,Jos Lewis,"April 16, 2020",5," Very good layout, style and design. Works great for me. I am now using it as my only and continue source for reading News online. Good job Microsoft. Thanks."
25,Jim Carlson,"April 8, 2020",2, The new format which now has each section contain endless stories is a complete mess. Why have repeats of items over and over. App is no longer worth the time to try to plow thru. Moving to other apps for reporting info.
26,No Name,"April 14, 2020",1," Thought I would try to replace google news but this just locks up. The second time I opened it I was able to click an article and then just lockex up again, so disappointing!"
27,DONESONZ,"April 21, 2020",5, Fantastic news app! I really like the gloss black dark mode too. I would however change the logo to something more eye catching and more large pics versus small ones..
28,Steve Hollingsworth,"April 10, 2020",4, The excellent: MSN gives you the stories where they have negotiated licensing. No paywall nags/blocking. Not so much: you can't follow a link to a new story and return to the story you were in.
29,Rich McCulloch,"April 7, 2020",4, It was a good app but an update this morning makes it crash when trying to bring up a story. Update: It was updated on 4/7 and seems to work as it did before.
30,Bill,"April 14, 2020",2, Looks okay (could be significantly more compact with a 3xN grid view) but it's just unbelievably SLOW to load or open news stories - so slow it's unusable!

Have learned to avoid any ""Sponsored"" segment, as it's just an annoying avalanche of ads. No content is worth that!!! This was my go-to news source since I got my first smartphone, but I recently uninstalled it. My eyes just don't enjoy reading small white print on a stark black background. What were they thinking??"
32,Mike Brady,"April 7, 2020",1," Worked great for years. Now it crashes as soon as I click on a story. I have Uninstalled the app and rebooted after each time, then reinstalled the app 3 times. No good. Please fix this. It WAS the best news app out there."
33,Alexander Bashmakov,"April 15, 2020",5," The best news aggregator app I've found so far. Nice intuitive interface, easy to customize the feed, not too heavy with ads."
34,Patrick Lynch,"April 14, 2020",5," No paywalls. Excellent, customizable app. Get only what you want, or browse all news articles. Updated constantly. My #1 news source for many years."
35,Stephen Dyczkowski,"April 6, 2020",1, After several attempts at installing and reinstalling the app keeps crashing. It loads articles but when you try to open them. The app shuts down
36,Remmy Martinn,"April 7, 2020",5, I gave this news app 5 stars for two reasons: 1. Almost no advertisements (unlike the MSN homepage) 2. Seems to be more balanced in how it aggregates its stories.
37,ER HD,"April 14, 2020",3," Too much advertising made to look like content. Diverse news content, not indexed. Some stories stay far too many days. UNINSTALLING"
38,Rick Sigurdson,"April 21, 2020",1, To many repeats of same article. Articles stay for long periods of time. Pretty much garbage.
39,Cheryl Herrmann,"April 22, 2020",5, Love this app and it's my go to all day every day. I do have other news apps but I use this one most!! Thank youüåû
40,Jay Vergel De Dios,"April 20, 2020",4, A lot better than most other news apps I've tried. And content isn't biased as most major news outfit are.
41,brian catlin,"April 5, 2020",3," Quite good, but lacks the ability to sort articles by date /time, so you have to scroll through everything to find the new articles"
42,Lui Prima,"April 18, 2020",4," Overall good app, but needs a way to personalize actual articles that are in your feed. Like Google news app."
43,Wilson Caba,"April 18, 2020",5," Excellent app! Does what it's supposed to do: gives me the news, a couple of formatting options, and doesn't crash!"
44,Arvind Kumar,"April 17, 2020",2," Ads are so high, doesn't let users to choose, which media they want to follow and which they don't ......below average, lag in smoothness üëé"

I have seen many people on here complaining about the paid ads. People this is what keeps it free, much like commercials on free TV. If you don't like the ads then find a premium(NOT FREE) news app, also the ads are easily identifiable, contrary to what others are saying. Best of all, it contains information from a lot of unbiased websites but also has a good mix of biased websites as one can compare the content."
46,Shyamnath R,"April 4, 2020",5," The best of all news app. All types of news from different sources at one place. Sing this app since I started using Lumia device. Now using this app in laptop, tablet and android mobile... :-) Good work for this team !"

However it is funded by ads that are hidden misleadingly among the regular news items. Some are blatant clickbait titles. (Example: ""People who retire comfortably avoid these financial mistakes"" goes straight to a product pitch.) Others are true articles that open as a web page absolutely smothered with banner ads. I would happily pay a small monthly fee to eliminate this jarring and dishonest user experience."
65,Althea Meier,"April 18, 2020",1, Embedded ads into the text of the article and ruins the speed read function of instapaper. No thanks.

74,Fabien Thebault,"April 4, 2020",3, Cannot expand widget to full screen whidth and widget does not show news unless refreshed. News algorithm for content is very good.

The app seems to get the content from the sites and shows it nearly on the app. It's free, there's a share function, good amount of topics, and dark mode. Biggest issue though, is the sponsored articles. The thumbnail and app layout makes the article look exactly like the rest of the actual news stuff. But the sponsored articles just open your default browser and sends you to a click bait article."

I can get a good amount of important and useful information, save/bookmark articles and share. It does not get so rough with advertisement or showing me my own searches in other apps like other news apps do. My only complaint is that most times, articles repeat down the 'timeline'(I don't know what to call it) or list of articles. You read or see the link to an article, scroll down, and there it is listed again, sometimes several times."

If you're interested in the big topics of the day, you're pretty well covered here. If you're more interested in niche stuff, it is not always so consistent. I have also found an annoying bug, where my Xbox interest (Bing powered) no longer updates. It was stuck with the same articles for a month. I switched to the Xbox one interest, which worked for a few days before also getting stuck on articles. When I tested the Xbox interest again, which I had entirely removed, I was getting the same articles that it had been stuck on from a month ago. Not sure if this is just my copy or what, but it's kinda antithetical to the whole mission here. I'll reinstall and see if it fixes. (again, the main news works just fine.)"

This is the closest I've found with regards to the news function. It's fast, responsive, has a good selection of news feeds (daily mail readers probably won't like their selection) and supports the concept of a local news feed as well. I have only given 4 stars because their news feed widget only displays the top news item without allowing you to move onto the next one, it also wastes space saying it's a Microsoft news feed. There are also placed articles in the news feed rather than ads that popup (so not too bad) but I would pay for ad free. Hopefully this will grow from strength to strength and not shoot themselves in the foot like Google or Feedly have done (their new RSS reader is now unresponsive with you try to use it)."

1422,Larry Pfafflin,"October 11, 2019",5," Nice way to stay informed from a good list of news sources. Most content is free, but a few ask for sign-ups or subscription.

1522,Kevin Davis,"June 29, 2019",4," It's probably been my favorite app besides Google News and Flipboard. These two do offer more topics to follow but Microsoft News is up there. Microsoft if you're listening, you could diversify your news sources more to include right or conservative views..."
1523,Carl Bloodworth,"January 8, 2020",4, The topics displayed are what I am interested in reading. Thank You.
1524,Mukesh Ramsingh Goyal,"January 27, 2020",5, Excellent news and very fast.
1525,C. L. Wood,"March 27, 2020",5, Broad detailed coverage of wide variety of topics.
1526,Charles Tetaz,"December 30, 2018",1, horrible because you cannot control the content in any way apart from gross categories (sport or news) content aggregators (such as Daily Mail) are promoted over original sources which is poor form. uninstalled it and went back to Google News.
1527,herbertjesse ratti,"March 6, 2019",5," fantastic information app, but you have restricted copy paste option, 1. it would be much better if you keep content page without loader option. Because it's getting confused when we scroll the news down. 2. There is no technology page option in the menu tiles."
1528,chintan gandhi,"November 8, 2018",1," Your app doesn't refresh news periodically, nor are new news available when refreshed manually. So about 90% of news are stuck for days. It drains away the charm of reading news everyday. I am uninstalling the app."
1529,Mahmoud Nabeel,"November 15, 2018",1," Worst news app ever! It's better on Windows 10 than on Android. Notifications are not expandable, data layout is so odd. Even the font used is ugly facing. Learn from Google News or Apple News, u r too far from their apps."
1530,Kyle Vann,"April 24, 2019",4," Occasionally slow to load and the ads are mixed with regular news articles which can get confusing thus only 4 stars. I use this almost every day to stay informed, and I still think it's the best news app available."
1531,David Nelson,"May 19, 2019",5," Enjoying the pre-defined categories as well as being able to create my own. Like that there's a Windows 10 version that works with the same categories, so I can follow the news I think important throughout the day."
1532,Anna Prytula,"February 27, 2019",4," I enjoyed the alerts that keep me on top of what's happening in the moment, but sometimes feel the content delivered doesn't always hit the mark with my interests. But, that is the news after all right?"
1533,Joann Cappuccio,"May 9, 2019",4, I like it because it is on top of the news. It allows opinions from the national papers such as the NYTimes the Washington Post and others to comment. That is what is what I like and the political comics ü§∏üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1534,A Google user,"January 18, 2019",5," I missed this app when my company moved away from Windows phones and back to Android. The Android version seemed less well laid out IMO but with the new compact view, it feels like the app I used on my old Nokia(s)."
1535,Lloyd Silverstein,"October 11, 2018",3," Used to work, but the last update killed the app on my Galaxy S7. Uninstalled and reinstalled, but the app doesn't open- just sits there with the splash screen cycling through the languages. Needs a fix ASAP!"
1536,Robert Martin,"June 28, 2019",2, The app has a major flaw in that one cannot return to position in string of stories After reading one story. Hitting or selecting 'back on a tablet takes one back to forest story. It does have built in return but users habits are to use device return.
1537,Troy Hunt,"July 30, 2019",4," Overall, it's a great app. The only thing that's a little frustrating is that the stories you may see on a computer are not the same stories that come up when you open the app (even immediately). Fix this and I'd give it 5 stars!"
1538,Richard Pizzuto,"October 6, 2019",5, App keeps up with the latest in whatever interests someone. Choosing through an array of categories allowed me to customize the content I want to keep up on. I only wish the app offered the ability to comment on articles.
1539,Rameshbhat Kl,"January 20, 2020",5, Best app. We enjoying & following this apps
1540,Robert Chambers,"November 4, 2018",1," Cute animated splash screen. Never loaded any content. I uninstalled, reinstalled, no change. So, the News is, use a different aggregater for your news. This one is without merit"
1541,D Wilson,"April 2, 2019",2," App is buggy & finicky, Content is close to pathetic; a mix of news feeds from sites with paywalls (inaccessible) and clickbait masquerading as ""news"". Legitimate stories can for days without refresh, and other real/vital news never gets picked up by MS News."
1542,A Google user,"October 14, 2018",2," Slick app ruined by far too much 'sponsored' content and limited range of sources with no way to add new sources or filter what I'm presented. Like Google News and Apple News, they show you what they want you see and nothing more. Disappointed."
1543,Mayank Gulia,"August 12, 2019",5, Much improved after the recent updates. News aggregation is all about choosing the right sources and Microsoft News is doing that now. It would be ideal if it also allowed subscription to magazines or newspapers from the same app.
1544,A Google user,"October 11, 2018",4," In the new advent it looks like leader as it includes almost every topics of one's interest and also provision for Local news ,smoothly! But one thing, don't think I, necessary to keep the old news for days."
1545,A Google user,"June 20, 2019",1, Too many of the same report under different categories. You might find one or two new stories mixed in. Seems reports are recycled appearing between current reports. No new reports on Saturday and Sunday as if the app takes the weekend off
1546,Arnab Debnath,"September 25, 2018",5, awesome app. after using for 3 days I can say I am extremely satisfied. also the app doesn't show annoying ad pop-ups like other news app. it shows the advertisement as a card. great.
1547,Star Kid,"August 23, 2019",4," I've been using MN for several months now without any major issues and really enjoy it. I have 8 categories/tabs that interest me yet everytime i exit the app, ''Tomorrow's Cars'' adds itself back as the 9th category no matter how many times i manually remove it from the list..."
1548,7th SON,"March 4, 2020",5," Nice News alerts lately, and very much when on the go."
1549,Anthony Creel,"October 6, 2019",5, Good App. I like it because I can tailor what I want to see and what I'm interested in. As with any news app nowadays you have to take some of the articles with a grain of salt and make your on decisions. Overall great!
1550,derek mclaughlin,"November 17, 2019",5, Great for getting first hand up to date information about the happenings around the world!
1551,Vencislav Nikolov,"December 9, 2019",2," No Bulgarian localisation, and no option for custom news feed. How difficult is to update the source?"
1552,Samya Shandilya,"December 25, 2019",5, The app is nice and useful but it has less political news Wish more politics news would be there.
1553,Valentin Ciocan,"January 10, 2020",1, Didn't work on OnePlus 7t pro. It crashes and makes my phone unusable every time I try and open the app.
1554,Cornelis Van putten,"January 24, 2020",5, I love Microsoft news on a daily basis.
1555,Harold Minerve,"March 18, 2020",5, Very very entertaining.
1556,Bill Polillo,"April 7, 2019",2," Probably not exactly ""fair and balanced"" when it comes to news... leans to the left pretty far. I find it odd when I go to an alternate news sight and can't even find the story MSN has in the headlines. Lots of bashing President Trump... most of which is not even newsworthy!"
1557,Kim Garback,"April 5, 2019",1," When the app first opens up, it asks you for your interests. I purposely left Sports and celebrity news unchecked, because I am not interested in that. However, strolling through my feet, news about sports and celebrities still came up. So what the heck is the point? I uninstalled the app."
1558,A Google user,"April 10, 2019",1," been broken for me for awhile now. just displays opening animation. clearing cache and data, and reinstalling doesnt help. update: full wipe, factory reset, and it still wont work. just sits on the loading screen with no activity"
1559,Brandy Alexanderson,"June 2, 2019",5," This is a brilliant piece of work. beyond measure, hands down, I absolutely love this app. Thank you Microsoft and thank you to the writers :)"
1560,Dan Brown,"July 16, 2019",4," You get a wide variety of news on many different topics quickly. It keeps me more updated with whats going on in more areas from sports to weather to entertainment to government, very helpful."
1561,Sibananda Misra,"November 5, 2019",3, I read daily MS News.News from all sources should be given. News from NDTV sources seems pretty biased towards some agenda.
1562,A Google user,"March 17, 2019",5," Love it; it's easy to use, good amount of News & World News for news junkies like myself, üòâ and it's not as jumbled as other news sites!!!! it's Great."
1563,Brandon Scott,"September 25, 2018",5, Great news aggregator with a dark theme and smooth UI. My only complaint is that you can't select/copy text from the articles.
1564,Evan Remmy,"October 31, 2019",2," Partisan mainstream media sources. Getting ""loading"" notifications randomly since the last couple updates."
1565,Sandesh Dhamangaonkar,"March 1, 2019",2," When I open this app, screen remains blank. Doesn't load anything. It's my favourite news app on desktop, so on mobile. Please fix this issue as soon as possible."
1566,Stephen Curry,"September 18, 2018",2, Super slow to load and poorly updating articles for business news. Preferred the old app interfaces..too much gossip and celeb news. Does appear to do stock and graphs as the old one did
1567,Jatish Shah,"September 13, 2019",5," I have abandoned printed news, as well as TV newscast. The news on Microsoft News app is comprehensive and unbiased in its coverage of international, national, local, sports and business news."
1568,Cliff Finney,"November 8, 2019",5, Good way read news and sports
1569,Birbal Sharma,"November 14, 2019",4, Good but few issues
1570,David Bees,"November 19, 2019",5, Great news reporting not bias
1571,A Google user,"October 29, 2018",2," Microsoft News app would be better if the app loads without a ""Oops, something went wrong. Try again""message. There are bugs that need a fix."
1572,Sirrie Gusto,"December 26, 2019",5," Balanced news, good app."
1573,Brian J Kealy,"February 6, 2019",3," Up to date stories, good selection - though some of the contributions are a bit tacky and over blown - think tabloid outlets üôÑ Even when you pick/limit your choices, it seems to revert to dross and 'popular' stories."
1574,John Balog,"May 10, 2019",3," same old news, same fake news, even the news is written like a third grader wrote it. you have to look for the news in an article because of the intros in most stories. same articles over and over.

1575,A Google user,"January 5, 2019",5," I have found breaking news to be pretty timely. I like that I am able to select my preferences. And if my news priorities change, I can update on the fly."
1576,Pradnja Paramita,"March 3, 2019",5, I've been using this since windows phone lumia 640 2 years ago and now I moved on to android. I love how simple the page shown and the dark mode! Love it so much!
1577,Alexander Lugo,"May 24, 2019",4," Great app after finding that i could reorganize my interests in the order i wanted. i really really dislike ads though. i mean this world really is becoming like Blade Runner, ridiculous. The ads don't obscure the experience but its kinda ridiculous nowadays days."
1578,Dollie G,"June 9, 2019",1, When I try to open a news article it just spins as it tries without success to actually open article. Microsoft drops the ball once again. Was a great app once upon a time.
1579,rickmon,"October 17, 2019",5, This is the best news app by far. It has so much news that most of the time you'll never finish reading the articles there are so many. It is constantly updating its news articles. Good going Microsoft!
1580,Daniel Dunivant,"December 26, 2019",4, I get most of my headlines from this app. I have not been disappointed.
1581,Ryan Schauer,"December 24, 2018",5, One of my favorite news apps. The custom feed aspects set the bar for how news apps should function. The way it pulls from multiple sources helps keep you honest rather than living in the completely biased world of a single source.
1582,A Google user,"January 9, 2019",5," I read this daily. i like it because it has catagories that make it quick to scan through, you can customize it, and the newest stories are on top."
1583,Andrew Tugade,"June 25, 2019",5, Excellent News source app. It is quickly becoming my go-to daily news feed. It provides a lot of category choices depending on your taste. Highly recommended for news junkies.
1584,Densil Brown,"July 10, 2019",5," unfortunately microsoft's phone OS is not a thing, so a perfect world of my phone and laptop being connected are probably all but gone. thankfully this app exist and you can at least get your media feeds linked on both platform in an almost seemless way!"
1585,Jai Gupta,"July 17, 2019",3, One problem that I have with this app is that when I open notification for breaking news it just takes me to empty page with just headline written and a photo saying breaking news. That's it nothing else. What am I supposed to do with just headline and a photo just saying breaking news?
1586,William Shoemaker,"April 22, 2020",4," Good sources, few paywalls, better results."
1587,George Garklavs,"April 7, 2019",3," This news app provides fairly good updates of news throughout the day. I've learned to avoid the ""sponsored"" content, which are basically ads disguised as ""newsworthy info"", or tabloid quality filler."
1588,Frank O'Deorain,"September 24, 2018",5, Good collection of the current news harvested from other original news sources. When you connect to the story you may have to accept cookies or advertising emails from them.
1589,Alex Galvez,"September 28, 2018",4, Great app for getting articles from a bunch of news sources. The only feature that would be nice is the ability to bookmark articles or save them offline
1590,Geoff Swann,"November 24, 2018",1," Used to be decent, light and handy app. Them it changed completely about 6 months ago into a bloated 500mb mess. My search continues for a multi outlet news app."
1591,Pao,"August 7, 2019",4," Great collection and very high quality. Select the topics onelikes. Concise and not many ads to cover the screen. Miscrosoft products are great and so are apps. Most are free, the laucher is really good too. Worth a tryvto see for yourselves."
1592,vivek c,"August 17, 2019",1, Stale news don't disappear even after a month. Advertisements are sewn in between news articles very skillfully- but are such timewastes. This app is better than TOI on relevance of content but fairs very poor in quantity. I need to start looking for an alternative soon.
1593,Joy Samadder,"October 4, 2019",1," Selection of news sources is not an user option....... I use many great products from Microsoft. However, this app does not let the user select or influence the selection of news sources (unlike Google News)...... Uninstalled."
1594,David min-koo Kim,"February 14, 2020",5, The stories are many in this app.
1595,Ken Privett,"August 10, 2019",5," Very good app that provides all the news - - without a pay-wall that Flipboard has. This is my go-to app for all the news, including Washington Post and New York Times. Most important: no pay-walls!"
1596,Daniel Koch,"April 22, 2019",5, Love this app. It is well layed out and functional never had a problem with crashing and it keeps me updated on world events well ahead of any TV or radio news programs.
1597,A Google user,"November 9, 2018",1," Used app for years as main news source, but it hasn't worked on my Samsung s9 since the update so I'm now searching for a new news app. Very disappointed as it was great before then but now it either doesn't load or I get a blank screen..."
1598,tds 101,"January 24, 2019",4," Great news app, but it needs the ability to better adjust the fonts for people like me who can't see the screen on-the-go al that well. Otherwise, it's a solid news app."
1599,A Google user,"September 18, 2018",5, It's simplicity and fact that it's news is compiled from multiple and reputable news sources makes this a great choice and my number one on both pc and mobile .
1600,Biala,"October 31, 2019",5," Habitual reading, variety of sources, and it's free."
1601,Julius Accardi,"April 12, 2020",5, Excellent source of news
1602,Dale Edwards,"January 16, 2019",4," like most legitimate news from other sources this news coverage has been very refreshing to read, there's a lot of variables in the coverage that make it interesting."
1603,Paula Fecteau,"February 10, 2019",4," lots of news aggregators out there. Microsoft news is fairly good, nice interface but I haven't figured out how to tune it for my interests yet. local, finance and politics tuning needed."
1604,Vince Carroll,"September 28, 2018",4, I really like getting an overview from a range of different news viewpoints. It's much more balanced than just one feed.
1605,GREEN MALEGAON DRIVE,"December 11, 2018",2," displays same news for weeks, no frequent update of news, no auto refresh by msn. last version was good, this version needs to be verified thoroughly."
1606,Ronnie Williams,"November 3, 2018",2, One sided political articles without a straight forward point of view. Same as Google. I was hoping this would be more balanced - It's not. Removing the app.
1607,Jonathan Shaw,"July 30, 2019",3," the app itself is fine, nice having everything consolidated however the notifications are broken. im still getting random story notifications despite the fact i have it set to only give me breaking news. sorry microsoft but news about love island is not what id consider important breaking news...."
1608,Blair Murri,"September 20, 2019",4," I really appreciate that the news stories directly connected to don't have pay-wall issues, but the two annoying things are the repetition in the list of stories and the sorting order doesn't appear to always be chronological."
1609,Dan Ardeleanu,"September 23, 2019",2," The news presented in a liberal/socialist light, like 95% of the media outlets. Tech and science coverage is decent, but sometimes politicized too. Shame on Microsoft for not being able to stay impartial. App's functionality is great."
1610,Roland Sanchez,"September 23, 2019",4," The latest Interests updates have become wacky in how my Top News section is now polluted with ""news"" sites and wonderwall photo click bait type ""stories"". Hard to find the actual real news from established outlets like WPO WSJ and NYT in this sea of other junk news sites."
1611,Zibido Avery,"October 19, 2019",3," The customization levels are nice. However, they stuffed with so much clickbait that it's essentially like the MSN page. I intentionally did not sign up for sports but they found their way to my page regardless because, well, clickbait."
1612,Geraldine Butts,"October 30, 2019",4, I enjoy this news coverage. I read it each morning. I like the different selections.
1613,Shirley O'Connor,"November 28, 2019",5, Concise and plenty of information and index for speed of reading.
1614,Mic&Sue Nelson,"November 23, 2019",4, Lots of news good coverage
1615,Steve MCMahon,"January 10, 2020",5, Very informative well laid out and an excellent selection of news and infotainment!
1616,d beck,"October 17, 2018",4," Thank you Google for forcing me to look for another news app after you dumbed down yours. :D Thank you Microsoft for a mature, attractive and tailorable news app! 4 stars because there should always be room to improve."
1617,Mike Davin,"May 23, 2019",2, it's OK but I've asked not to see opinion and it still shows. Also needs an option to dismiss an article and not show it again. I've been seeing the same few headlines for weeks now.
1618,Andrew Roesing,"October 18, 2018",1, Only used this app once. Opened 3 articles that were just clickbait and from websites with unrecognizable website names. That was convincing enough for me to immediately delete it.
1619,linda brittain,"May 23, 2019",5, Love this app Provides all the current news. Works great. I've had no phone problems since installed. Recommend it highly to stay up to date on the news.
1620,Bruno,"March 5, 2019",1," Why the category ""entertainment"" is always selected by default? Even after i remove, if i close the app and reopen, it comes with entertainment pre-selected. Need the ability to remove it. Please fix this."
1621,Russell Bradbury,"September 21, 2018",1, When it was MSN it was a decent news app. Now it runs constantly in the background using battery and crashes all the time. Also the adverts disguised as articles are really annoying.
1622,Estetyk,"June 9, 2019",5," Best news aggregator period. Countless sources like AP, ,Routers, NYT, Fox, CNN etc. Text only option, breaking news alerts. Night or Day and font size options. Hope this app is here to stay. Thanks developer!"
1623,seb gibson,"August 26, 2019",1," The ""sponsored"" articles are spam. They trick you by looking like a news article but direct you to spam sites. Outrageous. Sort it out. The news sources are also often opinion pieces, which hardly classes as news. Shocking."
1624,Monwar Hossain,"September 26, 2019",5, It is fine but there is no way to copy a word. I think it is important to add copy options for the learners. That's why learners will get the meaning of a word easily and will help them to study better.
1625,YOGESHK,"October 3, 2019",1," Every ball and Cricket score is pushed as notification on my mobile as BREAKING NEWS, even though i have not enabled any cricket news. Request the app developer to take some lessons on what should be categorize as breaking news and what shouldn't. if this continues i will have to uninstall this app."
1626,One Hd,"November 8, 2019",2, They come up when using Edge. Not Good
1627,Harry Moran,"November 10, 2019",5, Just the right amount of news.
1628,aymee silva,"November 15, 2019",5, Always keeps me updated all the time. I love it.
1629,Don Nelson,"December 24, 2019",5, Timely and informative
1630,Patrik,"March 31, 2020",2," Slow, made my Android One device hang. Poor selection of topics."
1631,A Google user,"January 3, 2019",5," Very good at getting updated news. Nicely organised into sections, wouldn't be without it. Also like the 'night mode', makes it great for reading on tablet."
1632,Carlos William,"November 14, 2018",5," Very handy, useful and elegant news app. It's very fast too. Thanks to Microsoft, we have it on all platforms"
1633,e valenti,"April 17, 2019",5, Lots of options to customize your feed. I use this app for keeping up with USA news while abroad. Widget and notifications for only breaking news (usually less than once a day) cater to my news consumption.
1634,A Google user,"January 1, 2019",5," Easy, good-looking app. Stable work. Local is only for big ones üòÅ. Still interesting for a big view in the case of bearing with some English."
1635,Huw Arrowsmith,"April 17, 2019",3," Coming from Windows 10 Mobile, this app is not as good. Can we have the option of more widget sizes/customisation and the ability to scroll through news pages from left to right?"
1636,Jack Weber,"April 5, 2019",2," Microsoft News used to be a very fine app, but they have made some changes in it recently which makes it so difficult to load that it's almost impossible to wait for the news to come up"
1637,Mukesh Patel,"December 25, 2018",5, I am very happy with this app. News updates are very quick. And it include numbers of renowned newspaper article. Dhanyawad.
1638,Robert Ferguson,"April 26, 2019",4," good diversity of news. easy to navigate. I use it a lot. maybe a few more focused feeds but all in all, I probably use it more than Flipboard."
1639,Brandon St.Michael,"December 30, 2018",5, A great way to get news from a variety of sources! Easy to navigate and easier to share on different social media platforms.
1640,Jennifer Kagemann,"June 4, 2019",1," Pretty good news app, which I default to. It gets one star for prompting me to review it. I don't need an app asking me if it looks pretty each morning."
1641,Dan Dimick Sr,"September 7, 2019",1," Each tab seems about the same as the previous. If an article is seen in one tab, remove it from next. Video often hangs with audio continuing. I see commercials twice on vidio feeds if I change screen orientation."
1642,Judith Finch,"September 13, 2019",4," I like the way I can quickly jump to what type of news I want to see whether it be my interests, Australian or worldwide. I like that I don't have to see sports results if I don't want to know yet."
1643,Gary Cendrowski,"October 6, 2019",5," Best mix of news of any app, well organized into categories. Not a lot of click bait like other news apps. You can customize it to your favorite categories and what news providers you like. I have it on Android and on Windows"
1644,david birks,"February 14, 2020",4, Better on windows phone but what the hell just use it anyway
1645,MYTHICAL CURT,"February 21, 2020",1, Cant keep track of where you are in app. After you read a article and go back to read more it starts you over.
1646,A Google user,"November 19, 2018",5, Overall a good news app. It has a general overview on news. Any more depth would make it inconvenient.
1647,Tye Adams,"November 9, 2018",3," It's ok but why, when I'm reading from the app itself,do I get a ""Download the all new Microsoft News app "" message? It's irritating and makes no sense. I may aswell uninstall the app."
1648,Prashant Chaubey,"January 17, 2019",5," Wow it seems like Microsoft is back. News, To Do (which is by far the best i have used), Edge, Launcher. Next improve the system stability in Windows 10 and launch a small sized phone at a competitive price.. you are good to go."
1649,Sali Gashi,"December 10, 2018",5," It's exellent app and very fast, it works flawless, it does for what is designed to do, great job guys, keep up the good work."
1650,Fred Snyder,"June 30, 2019",4," no pop-ups or overlays. just sponsored articles, which open inside the app, not in my browser. Decent spread of sources so sometimes I see content from the other side politically."
1651,Mark Nelson,"September 21, 2019",4," Mostly a good experience. However it crashes from time to time and I am unable to remove an ""interest"" that I have decided I am not interested in: I remove it and it comes back a little later."
1652,David Casuto,"September 29, 2019",5," Very impressed so far! Love that you can customize and save items easily. Clean interface, decent news sources. Would be great if we could customize which sources in addition to topics."
1653,Dei Samuel,"November 20, 2019",5, I like the apps very much because it feeds me the right news at the right time.
1654,Kelvin Kirunyu,"February 6, 2020",5, It is quite responsive
1655,Yovanna Medina,"September 18, 2018",5, Better than Google news and other many news apps. Great job. Love the way I can get news in English and Spanish from US and South America üòé nice work üí™
1656,Mac Turberville,"January 24, 2019",1," Lots of clickbait and ""alternative news"". Wonderwall, Medical Daily, Parentz Talk, Dollar Freedom..those are all ""news sources"" from this app. Not sure who this app is for. Try the AP or UPI apps"
1657,Dwayne Cole,"October 2, 2018",4," Like the stories offered...the format is well organized, makes it easy to find interesting topics and follow-up."
1658,Jake Edward,"January 26, 2019",3," it's okay But drop Taboola Ads, end the feed rather than repeat headlines. i have zero interest in some topics and should be able to deselect them. i like more regional feeds and i also like to see gobal non mainstream news with both left and right views so i can see whats really happening"
1659,A Google user,"April 1, 2019",3," Good app, but has some update issues. Doesn't always have the most up to date stories and there are some stories which just never vanish?!"
1660,Sharrod J. Stewart,"March 3, 2019",5, I enjoy having the news @ a moment's notice. Knowing the important news as it unfolds is helpful and thought provoking.
1661,Allith Galaviz,"May 27, 2019",2," the news portion works great, but i give it very few stars because the inital set up is a pain the ass. just give me the news, i can remove sections after the app displays something."
1662,Avu Sankaralingam,"July 26, 2019",4, Quick way to keep abreast of recent news. Dint look for highly curated content. However the app provided easy to use interface and wide enough variety of content to keep using on a regular basis
1663,rl Reaper,"October 12, 2019",5, I just switched from apple and was bummed that I didn't have apple news anymore because I liked fine tuning what I see and read in the morning while I drink my coffee and this is just like it I can pick things that I like or news I want to see you can basically pick anything or any topic to follow a...Full ReviewI just switched from apple and was bummed that I didn't have apple news anymore because I liked fine tuning what I see and read in the morning while I drink my coffee and this is just like it I can pick things that I like or news I want to see you can basically pick anything or any topic to follow and there will be articles on it this app is amazing and I use it every day
1664,William Weddle,"October 29, 2018",5, Works great. Easy to use. I like the presentations of multiple points of view in the opinion section.
1665,A Google user,"February 2, 2019",5," Microsoft News is another winner app from Microsoft. It is highly intuitive, easy to use, and comprehensive in contents. I really enjoy using this app."
1666,Fish Head Soup,"March 25, 2019",1," Pure junk......I thought I could get some unbiased news from this and I sorta did but 50% or more of the ""articles"" that come up are those POS click bait ads. They have no true stories but start Slideshows loaded with ads instead of an actual story. PATHETIC to say the least.

They have no true stories but start Slideshows loaded with ads instead of an actual story. PATHETIC to say the least. This is NO news app but another microsoft money grab. Junk at its best and worse."
1667,A Google user,"December 13, 2018",4, Surprising that the news served here is much better than Google news. relevant and informational rather than click bare nonsense. it would be great to choose and save news sources otherwise this apps great. highly recommended
1668,Stevio Clark,"May 21, 2019",1, soccer news hasn't been updated in almost a week -- primary reason I liked this app was the latest news -- I'm not sure how to give less than one star rating
1669,A Google user,"January 15, 2019",1, this app literally only opens half of the time. it will sit there for hours loading. I close and exit it through android and reopen it like 5 times before it decides to work. please fix
1670,Sidney Roberts,"April 8, 2019",4," easy to follow stories without changing pages. I hate stories that has a little on the page, then it's next or continue to keep following the story."
1671,Curt Hebert,"December 24, 2018",3," always been good, but newest version slow to open. sometimes it refuses to do it."
1672,A Google user,"March 27, 2019",5, Super news app! Way better than otherd that always too much oriented by the fata they gather from the device. This one is more like a real paper but with plenty of sources .
1673,Simon Alder,"November 19, 2018",5," You choose the articles of news you want to read, from the platform you choose. Constantly updating and very user-friendly."
1674,James Sparenberg,"June 5, 2019",3," Don't rewrite how Android does orientation. How I hold my device is not yours to dictate. When you do, you force me to hold it weirdly. Android does 360 rotation and so should this app."
1675,Brendan O'Connor,"August 20, 2019",4," Works well for what it is. Nothing special, but I have been using the automatic Google articles and they are all random trash now. A feast I know that this app will actually display my interests."
1676,Mark Licatovich,"September 14, 2019",1, I keep turning off the notifications and as soon as I re-boot my phone they are back on again. It is extremely annoying. That is why I am deleting the program I am tired of Micro Soft trying to control my life.
1677,George Gibbons,"September 21, 2019",3, It's ok but they mix the news with junk. They do label it but they throw in ads and opinions. And when you're searching through headlines you don't always notice that an interesting article is actually junk.
1678,Jonathan Ganaden,"November 1, 2019",5, Microsoft news better UI than Google news
1679,Sherman,"February 21, 2020",5, Very good news app.

1681,A Google user,"November 3, 2018",5, Great app with up to date news. Easy to operate. Adds are not intrusive.
1682,Ryan Payet,"November 23, 2018",3, Works well but take a very long time to load when switching from mobile data to Wi-Fi.
1683,Marion Husler,"October 9, 2018",3," So far ok. The stories appear better balanced than many other news apps. It takes a very long time to load, though."
1684,A Google user,"August 5, 2019",2," sometimes hangs, sometimes very slow, not connection, shame otherwise good. app. local news no longer working so dropped one star. I may uninstall it's just not up to the task."
1685,Richard Midwinter,"May 13, 2019",2," It works when it wants to, but mostly doesn't get past the start screen and just stalls. Its not a new problem so I'm not sure why it hasn't been fixed."
1686,A Google user,"April 18, 2019",1," Updated 30Mar2019 and app no longer works. Doesn't display any articles. update: will work, but not on wifi. also this newer version inserts fake news articles and click bait ads disguised as articles."
1687,Heather Jurvakinen,"February 15, 2019",4," just don't like the ""sponsored"" ads that never go away. good app with good news coverage. easy to use and tailor to what you want to read about."
1688,Patrick Payne,"July 30, 2019",1, I use google news and wanted to branch out to other services. Too many of the articles in this app are filled with click-bait websites and so many ads that ita almost impossible to even read the article. Too bad another Microsoft product sucks.
1689,Darryl Chambers,"August 30, 2019",5," Excellent app! This is my favorite news and information app. Very clean, concise user-interface, and easy to navigate/configure. Good work!"
1690,Robert Norton,"November 24, 2019",3, Layout is awkward. Sponsored stories not easily distguishable from news.
1691,toyeeb Aluko,"January 10, 2020",4, Giving information that are reliable.
1692,Jerrold Smith,"February 4, 2020",4, Still lopsided reports
1693,A Google user,"October 27, 2018",5, Thanks you Microsoft not putting annoying ads in this app. Reading experience is very good. Language change options are very helpful and easy. Overall best news app.
1694,Ken Kious,"February 10, 2019",5," good selection, not too biased in choices, new compact design is big improvement... especially when reception is poor."
1695,Axel Gregory,"April 28, 2019",2, the app has a hard time playing any video. the videos should be in a different format because there is a lot of lag and freezing.
1696,Lorna Bussue,"May 29, 2019",5, Microsoft News reports accurately on all levels of society. It is a comprehensive media with credible news sources. I like the clarity of the reports. Experience it for yourself!
1697,Kevin Turner,"July 31, 2019",5," Great app that gets a number of articles across multiple major and local news outlets. Helps expand my reading sources and keeps me from falling into the pitfalls of single source, single sided news outlets."
1698,oluwabusuyi ayodeji,"November 13, 2019",5," Good News app, nice UI also but at times the news feed don't refresh for a while"

1701,Saqib Sabih,"September 18, 2018",5, This is the best news app. I enjoyed it alot on Windows Phone. It's so much better than Google News. As a matter of fact almoat all Microsoft products are better than Google.
1702,Alessandro Cesarini,"March 24, 2019",3," It would be great if one could filter out news that are not relevant to personal interest, eg. Filter out anything that contains so and so in the title."
1703,A Google user,"October 8, 2018",1, What the hell is wrong with Microsoft? Are you serious? You are inserting ads to download your app when we already have it. What's happening Microsoft...lost your sense???
1704,Ramana Murthy,"April 17, 2019",4, Good selection of news. Neat layout. But rating only 4 because it does not send alerts regularly. I expect at least one every hour.
1705,Jeff K.,"May 23, 2019",1, Tried it. Microsoft news app does not allow you to remove news sources you find distasteful. Until it does it will remain uninstalled and I will go back to flipboard even though I dislike how flipboard does not moderate itself at all.
1706,Richard Woods,"May 27, 2019",3, Does the job well üëç I personally do not like the page presentation of local news as mixes the same name location of various countries on one page hence the 3 stars.
1707,Mark Toebbe,"June 26, 2019",5," I like the way the news articles are arranged. It's easy to find what you want. Also, all articles are contained in the app, it doesn't open up a website."
1708,Ay√≤mide John,"September 6, 2019",4," Simple, it consists of a compilation of free articles on a vast variety of Newspapers. There are a range of topics, with my focus being on Money, Personal Finance and Careers."
1709,K Afifi,"September 15, 2019",5," Indeed Microsoft News it's a worldwide news more than 90% and I am in love with it, because when I go through it, just like I have been traveling a round the world in no time wow :)"
1710,mitra khanjanzadeh,"February 18, 2020",4, U can share the wonderful moments with courageous adventurers
1711,Alex Zhukovsky,"February 22, 2019",1," Shame on you Microsoft for joining fake news media! Very bias anti-Trump oriented application that is not only discasting, but also poltisized and very left oriented. News media should be reporting facts and be neutral, Microsoft News become nothing more than fake propoganda. SHAME ON YOU!!!"
1712,Quang Le,"November 21, 2018",5," I've tried different news app, including the supposedly oh so great Google News. But I always come back to this app. Clean interface, neat categories really help me fins the kind of news I want to read on a day."
1713,Paige Dass,"April 6, 2019",5," Easy to use, extremely packed with very interesting information on a wide variety of features and topics,love it!!"
1714,Ml Hayes,"May 2, 2019",5," I like the app. MS could improve the ability to select, copy, and paste from the articles to other apps like Facebook."
1715,A Google user,"December 15, 2018",5, Great news aggregator. Always updated and gets the news from the main sources. Definitely would recommend.

1717,Tanay,"November 20, 2018",4, News not updating for some topics. Also the startup animation takes a lot if time. It needs to be fixed.
1718,A Google user,"February 18, 2019",5, This app is everything I've been looking for in a news app. Easy to use and I like the way I can place my interests in the fore. Plus I like the fact it has a dark background mode. Thks guys.
1719,Rog L,"December 10, 2018",1," FATAL FLAW- any interruption in connectivity dumps everything, 100's of headlines and pictures, which then must be reloaded. It's almost 2019, old MS."
1720,Thomas Curry,"February 18, 2019",3," I am giving this 3 stars. While I love Microsoft, and MS News, the clickbait has to go and the wonky off the wall news outlets. let's get back to real actual news ;-)"
1721,Grant Davis,"January 9, 2019",4," sponsored ads disguised as stories is annoying, by you learn to easily recognize them. Overall, got news aggregator with good options for sources and topics."
1722,Ashutosh Chavan,"July 3, 2019",3, the app is good for educational news and non political news... whereas it seems it has certain left-wing bias in projection of news... hence only 3 stars for devs. but bias seems to remain in app...
1723,Les Whiting,"July 30, 2019",1," Worked well for a few days, now can't sign in, apparently 'An Error Has Occurred'. You'd think Microsoft could design a stable app."
1724,Cecile Bos,"January 7, 2020",4," I like the news on this app , you can choose your preferred topics ."
1725,Joe Stewart,"January 24, 2020",4, News without paywall. Sometimes not updated often.

1727,Desmond Lim,"October 1, 2018",5," Has dark mode, is very stable and loads instantly unlike Google's version. However, has limited topics of interests for selection."
1728,Allan,"November 18, 2018",3, The formatting of articles is bad and random text in the middle of articles about downloading the Microsoft News app when you're already using the Microsoft News app is just sloppy.
1729,SUMIT CHAUHAN,"January 1, 2019",1," Installed it and under top Hollywood news all the news were outdated by months even years.. For eg MI6 to be shot in India, Venom gets a release date... Too significant to be overlooked in a news publishing app.. Uninstalled it after seeing 10 or so outdated articles"
1730,A Google user,"October 9, 2018",4," It's ok. I dislike all the ""sponsored content"". It used to have less adverts, which made it much nicer."
1731,Tim Smith,"December 10, 2018",5, Great news app with a broad range of sources. Shame about the ad asking you to download the app you are using disrupting the flow of every article.
1732,Chee Kukka Bathuku,"June 20, 2019",5, good detail for each news item but breaking news needs to be more slick. (Old Review) I am surprised to see the suggestion being implemented. (New Review) So 5* now
1733,Fernando Oliveira,"March 30, 2019",2," Most of the news app allows to copy the text, by selecting it, so I can instant translate to another language, for e.g. MSN would allow it"
1734,Ahmad Husni,"January 6, 2019",5, Nicely laid out and representatively selected prominent news from trusted channels in my country. The presentation is neat and easy to read.
1735,Ed Hudelson,"October 7, 2018",1," Can't download app to.get news. Had the app, but it wouldn't oen any news. Usual fix was to uninstall from Android and install again. Can't even gind same app"
1736,R Wetherill,"October 1, 2018",2, Awful. Much worse than the windows version. Difficult to read. No ability to add own sources. Font is poor. Too many ads. Yuk.
1737,Nikola Yanev,"March 6, 2020",1," It only needs to add Bulgaria and Bulgarian news into the feed, as the USA are not center of the universe. Thanks"

1741,Edward Noble,"April 13, 2020",2, Why do all Microsoft apps have a huge ugly white background and a tiny app icon? Cant they just make a full color icon? This is ugly and trash.
1742,Jim Mooney,"February 24, 2019",5," Great app. Clear, concise stories on current issues. Easy to navigate."
1743,John McGowan,"October 26, 2018",5," Dunno why I haven't used this before, probably because the old Google was so good. This app is top class, default on my PC and now on my Android. Thanks Microsoft."
1744,A Google user,"December 23, 2018",5," Excellent, it collects and updates you with news from multiple third party sources, e.g. Telegraph, Mail, Mirror, Hello, etc."

1749,Dave Price,"December 14, 2018",4," It's got a dark theme, so it's immediately 1000 times better than Google's new news app with eyeball incineration as the only choice."
1750,Cousin Ronnie,"June 7, 2019",5, I really like how it's broken into subject areas and top stories is feature for each. Easy on the eyes and very appealing.
1751,Anthony Spencer,"September 16, 2019",2," its good, brings many sources into one place, but lacks real customisation on what you see plus, has many sponsors with fakes news stories. Its a good idea but needs work."
1752,Helena Wu,"August 15, 2019",4," I can get instant breaking news from the app and they divide each topic on the headline - world, canada, finance, health etc. The content of each news is informative and clear."
1753,Jonathan Lott,"September 26, 2019",5," Great news application. Fits my needs for news on the go and with the added benefit of dark mode. Prefer it over the competitors like Flipboard, The Guardian and Euronews."

1758,A Google user,"November 28, 2018",2, Seems to be really slow. In changing stories. Sometimes the same ones come up for weeks at a time.
1759,TC B,"April 6, 2019",3," If this app worked consistantly it would get 5 stars, but sometimes it freezes, never getting past the opening screen. Probably 1 out of 5 times."

1762,Tom√°≈° Konkoƒæ,"November 1, 2018",3, News app it's great and I use it from old days with Windows Mobile. Please remove add for app what we actually using. Download Microsoft news app. It it's pathetic. You are software gigant and you can't write code to skip that app when it's detected? Come on.
1763,Joseph Wallis,"November 19, 2018",3, App is ok but the developer should create a unique branded sound alert for breaking news notifications. Just using the device default notification sound is lazy.
1764,Abigail Epplett,"November 1, 2018",2, Really strange assortment of news categories from which to choose. Customization was lacking for certain topics.
1765,A Google user,"October 21, 2018",1," News apps, especially from a large corporation like Microsoft should never incorporate advertising. News is a place for news, and nothing else. This app displays advertisements in news lists and articles. That is gross."
1766,Martie Kim Penales,"May 23, 2019",5, Better than Google News. All the articles are opened in dark mode if you enable it in the settings. Comfortable reading at night.
1767,Michael Ali,"July 13, 2019",5," always new news, wide variety of sources, good balanced views, a rarity these days! I keep wondering why I still buy newspapers"

1771,Jayarao Patri,"February 7, 2019",4," Good Coverage but at times news items are stale. Need to update frequently, otherwise it is boring to read the same item for a week."
1772,Italia Vin,"January 9, 2019",5," So far, so good. I like the format. First the fake news, then the facts, then the summary."
1773,Wade Shrecengost,"December 11, 2018",3," Very good application, but, it is REALLY slow to load and run."
1774,Christopher Wilkinson,"October 31, 2018",5," Great independent news channel, has all the main news stories together with video footage for most of them."
1775,A Google user,"October 18, 2019",5, Loved this app because it gives me a cross section from right to left of the news of the day. Continue to love it. First thing I read each day still.

1778,A Google user,"May 5, 2019",4," this news is awesome but i'll give 5 star if had notification just like ""news republic"" which has notification. because i used Tommy 3 plus had swept left but only news republic which has notification, please fix it."
1779,Lachlan Love,"October 12, 2019",5, I like having the same app on PC as well as phone. I can read an article on the phone and get interupted & finish reading it on PC.
1780,C Danny Johnson,"May 16, 2019",4," I like the news and stories, especially the diversity of sources. The adds are annoying."
1781,Nikolas Karampelas,"May 8, 2019",3, After the update it can't keep my preferences about topics and it desperately needs the ability to hide news from specific sources. Overall is a good app.
1782,A Google user,"January 25, 2019",2, It's okay so far although it's peppered with ridiculous advertisements and it appears that the news stories lack any kind of fact filter.
1783,Jane Simone Prall,"November 10, 2018",4," A bit of a faff to open up, but easy to navigate and find what you're interested in."
1784,A Google user,"October 11, 2018",4, Great news app. Would love to see offline capabilities though. Bit annoying seeing articles saying download the new Microsoft news app within the app
1785,Marc Calabrese,"November 14, 2018",2," Hate the new update. Slow, and much fewer stories visible unless you scroll down. I liked seeing 5 or 6 headlines on one screen."
1786,Vasco Raul,"December 29, 2018",5, Good App. I use it to see tips about money and how to improve my personal finances
1787,Eugene Lavrinenkov,"October 7, 2018",4, It would be great to add text selection. I learn English and it will be helpful to translate some words.
1788,Bjorn Tipling,"October 2, 2018",5, I like it. It's well made and the quality of news is high. Less ads than Google News
1789,Kay Trantham,"August 12, 2019",4, Some of the Stories kept dragging on. You get tired of having to change pages. Finally I just quit because I lost interest.
1790,Darrow Fisher,"October 10, 2019",5, I have probably tried 2 dozen news apps over the past 10 years and I always come back to this. It has the clearest layout and least ads. GREAT APP!
1791,Sachin Somesh,"October 12, 2019",5," I appreciate if you can stop publishing silly stuffs like the apparel a celebrity was wearing and focus on more real issues. Apart from that, its a worthy needed and recommended app."
1792,Gus Hayabusa,"October 24, 2018",5," Best of it's kind. Better and more frequent and fresh updates than Google news. Even for Greek news, it's better than Greek apps. Good job Microsoft."
1793,A Google user,"December 7, 2018",4," Much better but still needs to be more user friendly, like being able to navigate with one hand on a tablet"

Core functionality seems identical, but I can't swipe to my custom topics, only choose them from the hamburger. The options menu may as well not exist for all the functionality it exposes. I do like the app, but the UWP is just so much nicer to use. I would like to see the ability to ban or add sources from the feed. The British Daily Mail is not a trusted source and needs to go."

Very annoying. Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to load the news. Lots of problems loading even when using multiple devices. Tried uninstalling and re-nstalling but it still takes a long time to load. There are much better programs than this out there.
7780,A Google user,"April 18, 2019",4, It is very identical to what we get on windows 10 but crashes and lags all the time for some reason. Also I think it would be better to scrap all msn apps (as none of them works well right now) and combine them in one.

While fonts are adjustable, they are like egg sizes: large is barely medium, medium is really small and small is forget about it. Clearly, they don't care about visually impaired readers. May have to uninstall, soon. If you are vision challenged, keep looking. Microsoft -- just barely three stars, using a Samsung tablet."
7783,Stephanie Bedasse,"March 30, 2019",3, Wish the app was able to display embedded tweets and Instagram posts included in the articles. Often have to move back to browser version to see all content. Should have been addressed by now as an issue.

Pushes news notifications even though you keep turning this setting off. A good app though, but the sponsored adverts interspersed with the news stories are misleading. Also, Microsoft's own adverts crop up too frequently: I see plenty of adverts telling me to install the Microsoft news app!"
8444,Mark Gallagher,"September 16, 2018",1, MS had a great news app. Now it is the worst I have ever used. Does the improvements means always crashing when opening and bad tile design. MS this is a disgrace
8445,ItsM,"September 17, 2018",1," It keeps crashing, even when running in the background. It keeps trying to push news notifications even though I turned them off and thus it sends me ""Microsoft News has stopped working"" pop-ups. I'm fed up"

Even on high profile news days at least half the feed would be about a Kardashian or Real Housewife. Uninstalling for good. Years ago it was better, even the desktop version is better. Don't download unless you have a hankering for reading about silicon and saline filled women doing pilates."
8452,Sevak M,"September 3, 2018",2," Most of the reviews for this app are probably fake. You cannot set the default font in 2018! Nuff said? You cannot save articles for reading later. Clearly, Microsoft needs to rethink whether the current product manager for this app is doing his/her job."

If I stop my finger or lift and put it down, the screen will keep scrolling. It also does not contain financial information like the Microsoft Money app, but it's being pushed as a replacement in that app. Why are you trying to get me to stop using the Money app and switch to this one, which is a very poor replacement?"
8454,Ownership Ladder,"August 25, 2018",3," Its a good aggregator. BUT they tilt liberal. AND certain stories stay on the news page for weeks, sometimes months. Usually anti-Trump fact checks that have long since left the news cycle. WHY? Only MS knows."
8455,Thomas Youngkin,"August 10, 2018",4," Overall it's a solid app that suffers from several issues. Every so often 
the app fails to open properly with only one category properly loading up. 
The other major issue is that the categories keep resetting back to what I 
selected for the first time multiple times within a week."
8456,Larry Brennan,"August 10, 2018",1," The app no longer goes past the splash screen that shows the word ""news"" in 
multiple languages. I've tried rebooting, uninstalling and reinstalling. I 
really like the aggregated content and wish I could see it again."
8457,rahul bhuwal,"August 27, 2018",5, It's a really great app for catching up on all the latest news around the world. It also aggregates news across various geographical boundaries and varied topics. If you are voracious reader then this is a must have app.
8458,Ashwell Ganesh,"September 1, 2018",5," Loads and updates quickly, lots of topics to choose and refuse. Hundred of news articles from different news sources making it unbiased. You can also swipe up our down to browse and it has a dark light feature 10/10"
8459,John Britton,"August 23, 2018",4, Keep up to date with details of the latest and greatest political soap opera ever! Every day there's a new nauseating twist to the plot. Ladies and gentlemen step right...get your peanuts...popcorn...candy...

the platform itself. There is content but if I wanted a well rounded view 
of everything I am concerned about in the world, the options are very

great app."
8463,A Google user,"September 1, 2018",5," Interesting and informative news from around the world. Works well on my Android phone (Galaxy S5 neo, so not leading edge) and very quick to load stories. Scrolling is very smooth. It's a nice app to use."
8464,Arya Bhat,"August 11, 2018",4," The app is good but i have got one major issue with the widget. The latter 
shows the same headline for hours together. It looks boring and shluld get 
refresh frequently."
8465,Mike Hammons,"September 2, 2018",2, For the last several days the images in the news feeds are not showing. About 90% of the images are showing a gray box where the picture should be. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still see the same problem. Samsung Galaxy S8.
8466,Prashant Koli,"August 29, 2018",5, As a former Lumia user I still enjoy this news application compared to other. MSN and now Microsoft is unique with easy to access your desired contents. Great job team Microsoft (And if you guys reading this please bring back Lumia!)

disappointed in the recent update. Fix the problem and this review will be 
irrelevant."
8468,Google The Oppressor,"September 26, 2018",1," Biased news program that only shows news from one political spectrum or view, no balance, no alternatives and only one viewpoint.

8478,Brian Squires,"August 26, 2018",4," The app works fine on my tablet device, I like it that when I click on the icon the app opens in the orientation that I am holding my tablet in. I would give the app 5* if I could customise it so I could see how my shares are doing."
8479,Rajat Gupta,"August 14, 2018",2," It would be nice if I can hide a news or topic or publisher. Toilet paper
