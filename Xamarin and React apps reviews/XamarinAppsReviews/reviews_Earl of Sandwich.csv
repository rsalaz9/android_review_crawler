0,Todd Carlson,"August 24, 2019",1," I was registered, but now it can't find me. I reregister, and it still can't find me!"
1,Russell Lewis,"June 5, 2019",1," Says there aren't any shops near me. In fact, doesn't show any shops in the entire planet."
2,Catherine Magliocco,"February 5, 2018",1," This app was great until Earl of Sandwich changed it to exclude breakfast. I have used the app to order everything, including catering for work. Very handy. However, they have now removed the feature we used the most. Very disappointing."
3,Richard Coates,"March 2, 2018",5," Extremely convenient to use. Order in advance from any location, pay through the app, pick up your perfectly completed order, and get rewards points... what's not to love?"
4,Donna Winters,"May 22, 2018",3," Never seem to get my discount even though I am logged in. I have tried to 
log out and back in again, never helps. Otherwise love ordering ahead to 
pick up."
5,Valerie Baker,"May 19, 2018",5, I Love this place. I wish it was a little closer to my house.
6,Michael Czarnecki,"December 8, 2017",1, Rarely lets you login. All sorts of coding errors
7,Crystal Bennett,"November 4, 2017",2, My order had things left out of it twice
8,Nichola Mullett,"November 5, 2017",3, Needs to offer more of the range for example they do two BLT they should offer both on site not just the one
9,Carlito Laboy,"November 3, 2016",5,Simple app Best way to order in disney springs. Order while you walk around and avoid waiting in that long line just to order. Once we made it to earls sandwiches were ready and paid for.
10,A Google user,"October 17, 2016",1,Lost All Punches Lost all my punches with this new app.
11,Michael Blampain,"August 4, 2016",1, New login won't take my old login and I had a free sandwich and some punches towards another that are all gone. Thanks for continuing to offer lousy service.
12,Linda Masi,"August 4, 2016",2,"Lost my punches! Won't take login in new app, so guess I'm screwed out of the 6 punches I had (one away from free sandwich)"
13,Tyler Howe,"August 25, 2016",1,"Crap App New rewards program aside, this is a terribly designed app. It's just a wrapper for a website, but because it's split into sections, you have to log in multiple times."
14,Mike S,"August 5, 2016",3,EOP So no more credits for Cash transactions? What a joke that royalty club is now credit card only... Maybe take a que from Starbucks and allow us to put cash on our EOP app and then pay with the app...  Rookies....
15,jon chua,"August 4, 2016",1,"problems logging in if you had the old app, like I did, then updated, you might have a problem logging in. I did. I also had a free sandwich in the old app that I can't get to now."
16,Stephanie Zuniga,"August 31, 2016",3,"Its ok I like the app however when ordering a drinks it only has Orange juice, coffee, or hot tea. I would like to order the fountain drinks such as sodas or iced tea."
17,Alan DelBene,"August 7, 2016",1,Why? Forget this new app. Give me my free sandwich and old login. :|
18,Glenn Schiller,"December 22, 2015",1,Stop working Downloaded new version and stopped!!!! working!!!!
19,Jason Lui,"December 6, 2015",1,"Too far? Really? Just because I live ""too far"" from an Earl location doesn't mean that you should deny me of entering a code. I most certainly can drive and buy another Earl next week. And that shouldn't deny me of entering my code... Please fix."
20,Barb D.,"October 30, 2015",4,Help If you frequent Earl of Sandwich definitely download this app!

I have discovered that if you buy two sandwiches but pay for them together (on the same receipt) you only get one punch. One time the Barcode didn't print but I took a picture of my receipt and contacted earl via their website. They were able to give me the punch anyway.
21,Matt Nosal,"August 23, 2015",1,"Stupid app Stupid app. Wouldn't scan my receipt, kept telling me it was invalid but I just bought it. Wouldn't even work when I manually entered it. I would only get 1 punch but I bought 4 sandwiches. Useless, uninstalling."
22,Tinkerella's treasure trunk,"June 30, 2015",3,Nice App The bar code scanner is not working. And because of that I lost points towards my free sandwich. Need to fix this please.  ðŸ˜ž
23,Tim Grothause,"June 18, 2015",1,VERY Intrusive! No way to turn off push notifications! Needs access to modify system settings WHY? Needs WAY too many permissions for what it does. Guessing company providing app to EofS is raping our information for profit. Beware!
24,Damascus Bing,"October 2, 2015",1,Useless Wouldn't scan my last 2 receipts and emailing is pointless cause they won't respond. It's all a trick to get you to buy more then stops working when you get to your last punch. THIS APP IS A SCAM AND I'LL NEVER GET EARL AGAIN UNTIL THEY FIX IT.
25,Joseph Gullett,"September 9, 2015",1,Can't download. Error 505 Had the app and it updated and now I can't download it. Says error 505. Tried from my wife's phone and same thing.
26,Alan Crim,"August 6, 2015",1," Really?  You won't accept a bar code that is only 4 days old?  ... and I dared returned to your store and when I scanned the barcode at the bottom of the receipt, it tells me that the barcode is invalid!

27,John Miller,"February 9, 2014",1,"Still broken They get my name wrong in an email, and have yet to ""fix"" the problem. Been close to a month. Need some help solving your issues?"
28,Jeff Reitz,"April 5, 2014",1,Missing Locations Neither of the locations on Disney property or in Las Vegas appears on the location map. I tried scanning receipts and they didn't recognize them.
29,4_ROMM,"August 5, 2014",1,Always broken Android and iOS7 One day I just might be able to redeem a free sandwich I earned. Horrible Support!
30,deadelvis333,"October 26, 2014",1,"No Punch I visit their Anaheim store often. It didn't even show on their map, therefore it's not a participating store. If you use the business name then follow the business model. The whole participating store thing is a sham."
31,Jared Bevis,"March 29, 2014",1,Always says invalid barcode Always says invalid barcode even when manually typing.
32,Elizabeth Mcnew,"May 3, 2014",5,Yes! Hurrah! on my way to free sandwich.
33,Ike Nwanonyiri,"June 26, 2014",4,Cool app Nice but need more locations in Houston
34,Sarah Meade,"April 15, 2014",5,Easy to navigate.... Hope it gets connected to ordering.
35,John Hofmann,"December 28, 2013",2,"Barcodes don't work. Every time I try to scan a barcode, it says it's invalid, forcing me to go to the website to punch! Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help at all."
36,Kelly B,"December 27, 2013",1, Rarely ever works.  Every time I try and punch a receipt the app closes.  Not work the effort	Doesn't work
37,Danny Cruz,"December 15, 2013",5,Simple Quickly scans the barcode on the bottom of the receipt and links to Facebook for a free punch!
38,Aimee Whelan,"November 22, 2013",1, After a recent app update I lost all my punches. It wont let me log in and just says app is unable to fetch data
39,NancyJane Johnson,"November 19, 2013",1,Lost of punches I lost all 4 punches I had when you had your last updates and would like them back please.
40,Terry Pierson,"November 22, 2013",2,"Good... When it works Half the time the app doesn't work, so you can't redeem barcodes. Contacted tech support multiple times and my only fix was reset of phone..."
41,John Crowley,"October 10, 2013",1,Subpar App says I must be at location to scan punches when I am standing right at the register at the store. Constant issues and way to many updates.
42,Nancy Lantigua,"October 7, 2013",5, Best subs
43,Matthew Sherborne,"September 15, 2013",1,"Unfair If you scan receipts in one go, it treats them all as one visit, and invalidates them, never to be used again. Even though the dates on the receipts are different."
44,Ravindu Amantha,"October 24, 2013",5,Really cool Being Earl of sandwich's fan this app made me feel over the moon. i already got free rewards and through this app i am updated about all the changes and offers which are given by Earl of sandwich. I am looking forward for more free rewards and offers of Earl of sandwich.
45,Joey Scarcella,"July 30, 2017",3, Its ok the last thing i would like to see is being able to access your coupons when ordering online i had a cast member coupon code that wouldnt apply when ordering
46,Carrie Lanz,"January 14, 2016",1,Can't load it Can't get the app to load at all
47,Eric S,"September 18, 2014",5, Great app great idea
