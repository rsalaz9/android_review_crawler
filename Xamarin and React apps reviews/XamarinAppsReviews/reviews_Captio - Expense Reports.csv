The text overlaps and the UX again is just bad.
1,Simon Darr,"October 6, 2019",1, For a tool that has a very limited scope (capturing expenses) you'd think it would at least be good at that. It isn't.
2,Luke Gibson,"October 24, 2018",1," always crashes takes forever, theyve managed to make an app to make claiming expenses harder"

10,Jose Luis,"May 9, 2019",1," Fatal. Las capturas fallan la mayoría de las veces. Se queda indefinidamente con ""leyendo datos..."" No es posible eliminar capturas realizadas. Falla el cierre de sesión. No se puede cambiar el idioma. Los campos para introducir texto salen en colores que no dejan ver el texto. Un desastre."
