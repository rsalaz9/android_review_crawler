0,Rob Gerhard,"February 21, 2020",5," App as good as the food! (Ok... almost.) Been using the app for about a year on a regular basis. Maybe too regular. Works like a charm every time! The food is pretty good, too. Suggestion: show progress towards rewards."
1,R Adams,"March 7, 2020",1," The app doesn't work. I have tried ordering from the app a dozen times and it NEVER accepts my form of payment, whether it is a store card, gift card, or the credit card I use everywhere else!"
2,Haleigh Allen,"April 17, 2020",1," this app barely functions. Ordering pasta has never been harder. If there was no corona I would have just came in. However, because of circumstances I was put through the torture of experiencing the Piada app."

The app did not work. The discount was not applied nor was the purchase counted towards my despite scanning the rewards barcode on the app several times. Poor execution. I feel short changed. Great food, poor implementation if what was an excellent opportunity to enhance the customer experience and promote the brand. Service recovery? lets see."
4,Troy _,"March 20, 2020",5, Fantastic food and app seems great
5,Tyler Langdon,"October 29, 2019",1," Does not allow me to order, says there's an error no matter what combination of location, payment, or food items I choose.

Tried all typical Android troubleshooting methods, no results. Wouldn't be surprised if it's an issue with Google Pixel 4XL and/or Android 10. Will update rating once app functions."

I try it a month later and now I can't be delivered to? The best part about this app was that I could get it delivered. And we always spend more than $30. Real disappointment. It has very little use if I have to drive there myself. I'd rather watch them make it if I had to go there. So this place is back on the ""eat there only if we are on that side of town"". It's only 12 miles at most from me. Widen the delivery range for more stars."
7,Vincent Sica,"March 31, 2020",5, App works great and piada is the best!
8,Eric Schall,"July 19, 2019",1, App is trash. It's web based and not fully functional. (some things you can only do on a browser) Navigation is clunky. Took me a while to even find where to create the account in-app once I installed. Not worth it.
9,Henry Wilhelmus,"November 25, 2019",1, Gives error when placing order under all circumstances. Very dissatisfied.
10,DAwanna Bickley,"December 5, 2019",1, Wouldn't let me access my rewards. Keeps saying the queue is full
11,Duy Hoang,"September 28, 2018",1, App wouldn't apply the $5 advertised discount and is very buggy. Not worth your time.
12,Dwayne Ewens,"August 27, 2019",5, It is a great app. i can order on my phone and then pick up.
13,Tasha Scott,"April 15, 2019",5," Easy to use, makes for fast pick up and go!"
14,Joe Plaso,"August 8, 2019",1," Never registers my meal purchases, and therefore gives no ""Piada points"" for future use"
15,Thomas Kelly,"September 16, 2018",1, App would not apply the new guest $5 coupon. I uninstalled immediately.
16,Nathaniel Robinson,"December 26, 2018",3," Doesn't let me reorder past orders nor save as favorite. Just prompts that I'll be asked for size of the order, then I click ok then nothing happens."

24,abhiyanth rao,"February 13, 2019",2," placed an order, app said it was ready. I go there 5 minutes after the ""ready by"" time and was made to wait for another 15 minutes. Would just go there and order it myself going forward."

33,Ben,"October 24, 2017",1," This app is pure garbage. Everytime I try to place an order through this app it says ""choose a future time"" it's 1135am, 1200pm is a f***ing future time.

Everytime I try to place an order through this app it says ""choose a future time"" it's 1135am, 1200pm is a f***ing future time. And if it's not that it's, ""the restaurant is too busy to accept this order"" even if I choose to order it an hour in advance. This app is trash. If you need to order ahead then stick to the website. It was atleast programmed by a team of competent people. Unlike this app"
34,Marvin Cotton,"October 12, 2017",1, Can't use the app. If the time right now is 10 am and I place a lunch order for 1pm I keep getting an error message asking me to pick a time in the future. Gotta use the website.
35,Robin Craig,"November 15, 2017",3, Unable to ask for extra of a topping and same issue as others stating to select a future time ... when ordering online
36,A Google user,"October 31, 2017",5," Great app, easy to use!"

40,Collette Stec,"February 4, 2018",5, It works great
41,Kelly Duke,"July 30, 2017",2," Very glitchy. Needs work on almost every major function, but especially the two separate location finders."
42,Chris Shouts,"August 4, 2017",2, Very buggy. Rewards and saved credit card features don't work. Difficult to use. Website is easier.
43,Pamela Thompson,"September 2, 2017",1, Store claimed to never get my order just deleting app
