0,Larry Thomas,"April 22, 2020",2, I ordered using this app for curb side pick up and found out that the store does not even use it. They will not notify you when your order is ready and it also doesn't kick back errors like out of a certain item.
1,Lim Supangkat,"March 10, 2020",1, Terrible app. It dies not allow you to register your Family Value card and you cannot see your account number again after app setup. Poorly designed app.
2,Stacie Morimoto,"January 4, 2020",1, Tried multiple times to create an account & login but was unsuccessful. Uninstalled app. I have a Samsung Note 9.
3,SJ O,"September 19, 2018",1," It looks like the app is only for iFon users, tried multiple times to login but goes to website. Logged in at the website and says that user has been migrated then stuck in a loop."
4,Gabriela Orta,"August 14, 2019",5," I love how efficient this location, the staff is always so friendly !! very organized! & most importantly food is AMAZING !!!"
5,Roxanne Ramirez,"March 24, 2019",1, I just register and it will not let me log in. I registered the card number and that is fine but I cannot log into the app or website. Please help
6,Tom DaRin,"June 5, 2019",2, Very buggy - can't edit exp date on credit card so had to delete it on desktop site and re add it

9,Jesse Turner,"January 15, 2020",1, Doesnt log in through facebook like my web site does
10,Hinkles Twinkle,"December 3, 2019",2, So I can't seem to find a way to link/show the Family Rewards? What's the point of having your account on your phone if you can't use your rewards? Am I doing something wrong?
11,Kat Kohler,"October 29, 2019",3, GR8 Food and Service always!!! How do I connect my Stonefire Grill Loyalty Card to the App.?
12,Kevin Yau,"November 17, 2018",2, What happened to map tracking of delivery?

16,Richard Wohl,"November 14, 2019",4, Great Place
17,Chalmer Powery,"July 3, 2019",5, EXCELLENT!!!!
18,Jesse,"July 24, 2018",1, Unable to place an order. Disappointed.
19,Leona Goebel,"July 8, 2018",5," Love the app. So many ways to customize your order; I don't have to worry 
they will misunderstand my requests! Sometimes our local restaurant is 
slower, but that happens with all fresh, cooked to order, good restaurants."
20,Lisa G Davis,"May 2, 2018",3," The app is ok. I would order more if I didn't have to wait at least 10 
minutes more than it says most of the time and they don't offer any 
discounts or rewards. Staff takes walk-in to go orders before online orders."
21,Nicole Sullivan,"July 9, 2018",1," App doesn't work. Error message every time information is trying to be 
processed."
22,Erin Sams,"June 25, 2018",3," Easy app for ordering food, but disappointed the rewards account can't be 
linked."
23,robert cassiadoro,"January 17, 2018",5," Great food, Great service, Great value!!!"
24,Best in Green,"October 24, 2017",4, I like that it has pictures and very detailed. I like to know that i have other options within the options like size. I also like that it describes the portion. I'm always afraid I will order too little.
25,Pam Gmail,"December 3, 2017",4, Generally a good app. I just wish there was a way to write a note if you want to give a specific instruction. For instance I ordered the cauliflower salad but in the options I could only say if I wanted the dressing or not. Could not say put it on the side.
26,Blair Stanford,"September 6, 2017",5," Easy to order and a family favorite, especially the tri tip and lemon garlic. Have not had any issues and have ordered dozens of times and food has been ready on time, every time."
