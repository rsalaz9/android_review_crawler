Also very informative with full menu listed.  Great app!!!!  So I am editing my review after the whole experience.   When we got to the restaurant,  they did not have our order.  I did everything right,  I had the right location, I had an order number and everything.   One of the employees even told the manager that this happened a couple days before as well.   I'm not sure where our order went but,  they asked us to click on the button at the bottom of the screen showing our order that said place this order again.  Then it worked.   So then they had our order and we waited for our food."
