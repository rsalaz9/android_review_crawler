1,DY OH'AR,"March 26, 2019",5, works great and silky smooth on my Pixel 2XL
2,Mike O'Rourke,"February 14, 2018",2," Significant battery drain while idle. Could also use a map/pin drop feature for delivery location instead of entering a long address.   Also, it's not an app problem, but why would you stop delivering at 1:15 PM?"
