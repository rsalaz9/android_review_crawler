0,Sean Gunville,"July 17, 2019",3, app is pretty good for basic schedule and I can deal with some app crashes. The frustrating part is the discover music feature I listen to music trying to figure out who to see and anytime you skip forward a track it crashes.

I simply want to see who's playing on the new Jones Park main stage. I click on venues, Jones Park and it gives me info about the park. Nothing about who's playing there. Really?"
2,Josh Heiligenthal,"August 6, 2019",4," Worked great to see when,where, who and what kind of music the groups played. Wish thw pop up schedule was on it though."
3,David Kamps,"July 24, 2019",3," Good features, but print overlap is hard to read."
4,Mike 2.0,"July 11, 2019",1, Not good on my brand new phone. Text over laps. I'll use a paper schedule instead.
5,Sara s,"August 8, 2019",5, yay!
6,Robert Merkel,"August 2, 2018",4," Nice app and very helpful. Few minor things to improve on. Music stops when 
screen locks or not on app. When you heart an artist I had to back out and 
reload page for hearts to be shown next to their name."
7,Anon,"August 4, 2018",5," Perfect combination of features that are straight forward and easy to use. 
Multiple search options and ability to build your own schedule are my 
favorite."
8,Jonathan Roidt,"July 28, 2018",5," Came together nicely, this app works great!"
9,Dan Lieuwen,"July 16, 2018",4," Great, but the shuffle playlist of artist does not work...no sound"
10,Mark Johnson,"April 23, 2018",5," Nice, straightforward app to help me navigate the festival. And it's 
beautiful!"
11,Bob Minter,"July 31, 2017",5, This year's app is awesome. Makes the Mile easy to navigate plus the scheduling is on cruise control.
12,Ben Stern,"August 15, 2017",5," Very helpful for planning your day out as well as keeping track of who you have seen. This year, the updates based on weather were very helpful and timely.

I didn't spend much time listening to the songs on the app, so I can't comment on that. I also enjoyed their updated social tab. All in all, I think it was incredibly useful for the festival, and I look forward to improvements to it in the future."
13,Larry Schierl,"July 21, 2017",2, Junk. Doesn't work.  Tried installing 2x on my Android phone.  Not cool ! Please fix ASAP
14,Jim Larson,"July 16, 2017",4, App is essential for planning your day.  But white text on a sometimes lighter background is frequently hard to read.
15,Ron,"July 19, 2017",3," As others have stated, samples don't work. Also, it would be handy to have addresses for venues and maybe a downtown map."
16,Carrie Kussart,"August 5, 2016",2,App crashes It crashes more than it works.  I only got the first music demo to play. Then none of them worked. The idea is good and it could be useful if bugs were worked out.
17,Randy Ahrens,"August 4, 2016",2,"Great concept poor execution Constantly crashes.  Song samples don't play, other than the first one you try after installing."
18,Michelle Eilers,"July 22, 2017",3, Where is the link to the my mile acct that is on the website? Could also use a search feature in the artists & venues please...
19,Connie Heil,"August 4, 2016",4,Seems to be working now Thanks!

21,57haddreams,"August 6, 2016",1, Not very useful...
22,A Google user,"August 6, 2016",4, Seems to work fine very useful
23,Tim Miller,"August 4, 2016",5,Excellent This is a great app for a great festival
24,Byron Burrier,"August 3, 2016",2,"Needs search by genre Not familiar with all the artists. Would enjoy discovering new favs that play music I like, but I don't have time to run all over the Ave."
25,Tania Verhalen,"August 1, 2016",1,crashing upon opening worked great last year. crashes upon opening this year. I reinstalled it several times
26,Pete R,"July 30, 2016",1,"NOT for an older version! It crashes, freezes up, and generally doesn't deliver what it promises. Maybe next year?"
27,Jon Awe,"July 26, 2016",1,Crash test dummies built this app Crashed every time I tried anything
28,Steve Reindl,"July 15, 2016",2,Crashed! Looks like it will be a cool app after they fix the problem of it crashing when you try to play song samples
29,Kristal Hill,"August 1, 2016",1,Crashes I loved using this last year. This year it keeps crashing. I do hope it works soon.
30,Nan Biese,"August 1, 2016",1, Crashes on Opening app. Unusable.
31,Kelly C,"May 26, 2016",2,"Good, but crashes in background Read above"
