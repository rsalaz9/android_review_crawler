0,Melanie Wempe,"May 29, 2019",4," The app would be perfect if there was a way to permanently store a rewards number in your account...not have to enter it every time. plus, the human readable number on my card is now illegible, so I have no way to enter my number when I order on the app."
1,Jennifer Campbell,"February 14, 2019",5, Always friendly and helpful. Food is always fresh and good. Lots of healthy options.
2,Robert Kubla,"March 11, 2019",4, Not too bad. But when choosing a combo with a salad it does do not give you an option for a type of salad dressing.
3,Joe Barnett,"February 19, 2019",5, easy ordering with delivery built in!
4,Evan A,"May 11, 2019",1, we placed the order and showed up at the store but they had no record of our order. the order number was no help to the staff at the restaurant. Although we have the confirmation and the charge on our credit card. unreliable garbage app.

7,Valerie Gonzales,"October 29, 2019",2," No rewards program, why not?"
8,Michael Blake,"February 23, 2019",1, Maybe don't list delivery as an option then let me get through the whole ordering process including delivery address before telling me delivery is not possible at this location.
9,Sindy Guyton,"May 28, 2019",2," Paid for extra avocado & sauce on side didn't get. Also polmagranit berry iced tea, tasted like perfume.

I was placing an order to pick up at the drive-thru. My last item was for hot chocolate. I only asked that I have whipped cream placed on the hot chocolate. After selecting whipped cream I scrolled to the bottom of the screen, put my name in the place where it was supposed to be, and clicked on add to basket. I was then asked to select my milk in the select milk section. The problem is there is no select milk section. Therefore, I could not order my hot chocolate because of this issue. Would you please fix this. I called the restaurant and let them know about this issue. At least I will get my hot chocolate today. Unfortunately my husband will have to order & pay for it separately when he goes to pick up our order at the drive-thru."
