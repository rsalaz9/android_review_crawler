0,Jin Laxmidas,"March 9, 2020",3, The direct connection to Google G suite and Gmail is what we miss. Our team complains constantly that Insightly is not intuitive and easy to use. I hope you can fix this otherwise we'll be forced to move to a different CRM
1,Kevin Sippel Jr,"January 24, 2020",5," App syncs nicely, and puts nearly all of the power of the desktop version on android."
2,Pan Talon,"January 6, 2020",5," Great mobile companion to web CRM, accepts contacts shared from phone."
3,Bloomquist Chimney Services,"January 18, 2020",4," It is very convenient. Of course there are things that have to be done on the sight that can't be done on the app. Most of what gets done on the app does sync with the sight. Somethings do not.

Of course there are things that have to be done on the sight that can't be done on the app. Most of what gets done on the app does sync with the sight. Somethings do not. If I create a task for someone other than me on the app, most of the time it doesn't sync. The really strange thing is that I can sync my Google calendar to the app, but not to the sight. I would say more, but I am out of space."
4,Gordon Remmington,"October 30, 2019",3," No issues with the app..but it's missing the most useful feature from the web interface - Reports. For a manager, viewing reports is essential for tracking performance of sales and projects, and you have to revert to the web interface instead as the app doesn't show them."
5,Chad Clements,"May 8, 2019",3, It works OK. There are some quirks that makes it inconvenient to use. Chiefly that I can't copy an email address from a lead screen on my Pixel 2 running the latest version of Android. I want to tag my emails sent from Gmail but can't copy the addreses.

Chiefly that I can't copy an email address from a lead screen on my Pixel 2 running the latest version of Android. I want to tag my emails sent from Gmail but can't copy the addreses. UPDATE 5/7/2019: developer still hasnt added this functionality. What's the point of having an app when it's easier to work from a mobile browser to get work done??
6,Sky Sorenson,"December 5, 2018",2," There is no way to create a report by birthdays.  This should be CRM 101.

This should be CRM 101.    I've been paying for the service for a while and they just ignore any requests for help on this.  The 'help' folks tell you to put the request in a forum where there are a bunch of requests for this languishing.  They hosted a webinar where I specifically asked about it, the host promised to get back to me when I pointed out that her solutions wouldn't work, and I never heard back.  So frustrating. I'm actively researching competing CRMs."

Samsung galaxy s8+ can this be fixed?"

Anyone doing B to B sales knows that being able to search for a name or LLC is crucial to getting the right information while on a sales call. -Canot sell multiple products once set up as a opportunity. EG, once a contact(EG Lead>Opportunity >Sales>Contact) showing they are interested on your new product is impossible."
11,Aaron Little,"September 30, 2019",4," It's a really good app for completing tasks and logging calls. The web based portion is better for creating calls, organizations and tasks. Hand in hand they are awesome."
12,"Tim Montague, Solar Expert","November 27, 2018",5, Great CRM app. Affordable but robust for small to medium orgs and companies. Modern interface. Easy to learn.
13,Kelly Sequeiros,"November 5, 2018",1, I can't sign up! I fill in all the fields and nothing happens when it refreshes.
14,Daniel Bainbridge,"May 31, 2019",5, quick and easy to add contacts and modify what stage in the sales cycle the client is. This will definitely help me grow my business
15,Tran Duc Nghia,"October 1, 2019",5," Good, although subscription is a bit expensive, even for a longterm SME user like myself."

19,Hans Giraud,"June 26, 2019",5," Great interface, Effective, and easy to use"
20,Matt Stiller,"November 26, 2019",5," I manage a network of about 650 people and this CRM has worked really well for me. Were about to grow to about 4000-5000 members, and I am comfortable using insightly for that. Go Google go🤙"
21,Jim McLaughlin,"December 14, 2018",5, Love the combination of crm and project management. Does most of what I need.

I have seen several comments here and on the insightly help forms about this. The help desk has not oh knowledge that they are having a problem or let us know any action they're taking. I just want to be able to edit my notes in the field as this is a large portion of my job. It does not seem that Apple's IOS is having the same issue.

Very fast response publicly and no meaningful follow up after... while I pay for sonething I cannot use. Shocking! The app used to be useful but I cannot log in after upgrading to a Samsung S9+. Log in approved and straight back to log in screen where I can do it again... and again... I received a pleasant message thanking me for input but nothing further has happen. I am paying for a service that I cannot access via the app.
39,Jann Mirchandani,"August 2, 2018",5," I've been using Insightly from the beginning. The app has continually 
gotten better. While I mostly use Insightly on my computer, it's great 
being able to work efficiently on my phone when I'm away from my desk!"
40,Allen Hauptman,"August 21, 2018",5," I've been a power user of Salesforce, in the past. I've been using Insightly for 14 months. It has everything I relied on in Salesforce at a fraction of the cost. I love it."
41,Gabriel .Camarena,"August 4, 2018",2," This is not intuitive. There is no way to add notes to leads, 
opportunities, or projects. There is a Related tab for each of those that 
says Notes but it is unresponsive."
42,George Kiorpelidis,"July 27, 2018",4," I've been using the desktop version since the beginning and am really 
loving the convenient app."
43,Brian LoBue,"June 19, 2018",3," Interface could be more useful.  I just arrived in a city where we have some customers.  Couldn't do a sort in the app of organizations by state or city, so it was useless to me while in transit to see who I needed to start setting up visits with.  Too bad, because all the data is in their system."

The app originally was pretty good and I could see it becoming great in the CRM field, but they took some wrong turns. First, how does a CRM app not allow the use of the word appointment anywhere? An appointment is the basic unit of sales. All of the previous CRM's I used allowed you to easily schedule an appointment and call it an appointment. It causes a lot of confusion, an event could be a lot of things. Next, they had custom fields you could make and use, but in an update they did away with them and you lost all data you entered into them. And speaking of losing data, as far as I can tell there is no way you can back up your data and keep it safe yourself. Now they have updated the software and it is incompatible with my device. How nice. Once again they have took away features, in this case the ability to use it. They have some things working for them, but it looks like some competitor has infiltrated their business and is sinking them (no I am not serious, but they couldn't do much better if they were) This company desperately needs to communicate with some traditional salespeople and listen..."
45,A Google user,"May 29, 2018",4," Wish I could load my companies on to Google maps easily to see all accounts 
without having to use another application like Badger."
46,Edwin Jeppe,"May 30, 2018",4, I currently use GEOCRM which is a free crm with a web and mobile platform and has all the features and everything I need. Tried this app out after a friend recommended it. Nice UI and great design.
47,Justin Kattau,"June 18, 2018",5," Good app for keeping lead organized. You can record contact,and keep track 
of interaction so no one falls through the cracks."
48,Cera Ridley,"May 25, 2018",5, Great app. Insightly keeps us on task.
49,Daniel Shinkle,"March 26, 2018",5," The app has access to all project and contact information in a convenient format. Unfortunately, there is no off-line access. I've tried several other project management systems and this is the best I have found."
50,Mel Neil,"March 21, 2018",5," Since the last updates, this is awesome. Do wish I could use it offline and then callibrate with the desktop once I'm bcak online but even so, I am in love with it"
51,John Williams,"March 27, 2018",4, Nice easy to use. Would be good if voice to text notations were available.
52,PaPa Morty,"April 25, 2018",4," Iike it. Takes a few YouTube videos to really figure it out (I'm new to 
CRM), but I can see how powerful it can be."

61,Brian Hampton,"January 6, 2018",2, Last update broke the app. Can not edit or add new notes. Been broken for 2+ months now.
62,Aaron Daley,"November 29, 2017",4, Pretty good mobile version of the desktop version. No complaints so far as I can use it in there after a sales call to make notes about the transaction.
63,A Google user,"November 1, 2017",5, Insightly is well organized for what I do as an Appliance dealer- relationships were never easier to keep track of!

Granted, I am not a large company, so many of the improvements are not something I need.  However, it is important that they continue to try to make this app more friendly and capable.  I would recommend this to a sole practitioner who needs to keep a large number of clients and prospects in control.  I make notes of what I said and what he said.  I email through this app, or I attach the email during the process of sending the email using my gmail account.  The more I use it, the more I depend on it.  I use the mobile app to record meetings after they take place.  When I am sitting in my car, before I move to the next appt or to home, I record the most important aspects of the meeting.  Buy it."

When importing contacts search for specific contacts will be imported instead of having to scroll through an entire list. When doing a mass Imports a lot of the organization's I had attached to my contacts didn't come through. Import the contacts one at a time the companies they work for show up. If I make an update to my contacts in my address book and then we imported in, the contact duplicates instead of updates. Something in the system that could recognize duplicates, or ask to merge certain contacts would be ideal. In fact I'd rather keep my contact list on the phone I have it sync rahter having to push it up each time. The same thing with Google Calendar, I would like to keep my events on the Google side but be able to add events from the app or the website be able to see the calendar through it. Basically I'm not asking insightly to store my company data as much as help me manage and organize it."

We love the customization it allows us and it helps us keep track of our enormous list of tasks, contacts and organizations, and our ongoing projects, in an organized manner.  The one thing it is missing, is the ability to integrate our financial software, but we are hoping insightly will incorporate that soon."
70,Bemmygail,"July 4, 2017",3, I could not see income through the app. No reports section I can review. Or maybe I just could not find it.
71,Farrell Gosnell,"September 12, 2017",5," Perfect CRM for us! Every detail of every project in one place, well actually, in many places, as in your phone, tablet, laptop, lets you work from anywhere! Love the Gmail gadget and Google calendar integration!"

73,Daniel Shinkle,"September 23, 2017",4, Easy to use mobile version of Insightly seems to have all the functionality of the web version. It is stable and fast. Only downside is the lack of offline usage
74,Din Duong,"August 22, 2017",3, Does app have the record ID like on the website? I could not find it in app. A bit disapointed
75,Angas Reid,"June 28, 2017",5, Absolutely love what Insightly has done with the app. Significant improvements on every update. Awesome work.

Hopefully this gets read as I trust other users are experiencing the same, but are unable to help the developer to fix the bug.  I am at the stage whereby I am know in no position to upgrade out of fear that the bug may not be resolved.  I want this app to do well, but currently I am in limbo."

BIG PROBLEM was that the accounts between my colleague would not link and her data was in my account and vice-versa.  I could not save e-mails or contacts direclty to my Insightly account as it was linked to my colleague....makes it difficult to schedule tasks and like them to a client.   It just spirals out of controll from here with many little problems.  Very amature job.  Too expensive for this level of service.   The dashboard does not show enough information and too many clicks to make it a smooth workflow

My biggest objection is its inability to export and re-import data which requires major fixes, a common complaint from many users.  The web version and available apps are great, but no portability between Insightly and mobile apps.  There continues to be a rather ho-hum response to our concerns which leads me to believe the support personnel in this Organization are few in number and there are not enough resources to continue to improve the product.  I guess it ultimately comes down to you get what you pay for."

Later in the day however, they all disappeared again. The contact list just shows a list of names with no organization names. Under organizations, everything is as it should be; the problem is just with the contacts. It's still usable for my needs because most of the time I'll be using the organization list but if the contact list problem could be fixed, it'd be a 5 star app for me. I'm not using it for sales, I'm using it to keep track of inspections and I don't need a full blown, complicated CRM so I like the simple, uncluttered interface. I'll be relying on it heavily so I hope no other problems appear. Update: Just found out Contacts and Organizations can't be filtered in the mobile app. Please add that feature! It would also be nice to be able to filter using tags in the mobile app."

I obviously use the website on my laptop, but I have the apps on my Samsung Note 8.0 and my Google Nexus 5.  The free flow of data from one to the other is seamless, and the interface is straightforward and easy to figure out among the three versions of the platform.  My big gripe is that the apps lack a great deal of functionality that are offered by the desktop version.  A more complete mobile package would be great.  One feature I would love to see added would be that when I tap to email a contact from within the app, it should give me the option of which email app to send from (I prefer the GMail app, but the Samsung Email app is defaulted on my tablet.)    Also, when sending an email straight from the contact, it would be a boon if the email address that I'm supposed to CC if I want to attach that email to the contact were already populated."
239,Pat Jutte,"August 11, 2014",5,Awesome CRM App! I can't believe some of the other reviews. Complaining about not having automatic refresh. I'm sorry that you have to work a little by pressing a button. This app is free and is by far better than most CRM's. Thank you for the great software.
240,Gareth Scammell,"October 6, 2014",5,Great CRM This has changed the way I work.  I have been using this along with the online tool for months now and can't fault it. They even give you vids and webinars so you can get the most of it.

337,Erik Skjaveland,"July 4, 2013",3,"Nice but, I wish it would cache more on the device for instance on the sdcard, then let you choose how much space to use. Also who sorts their email newest on the bottom, but displays the top and forces you to scroll to the bottom? Really?"
338,Guy Parker,"July 10, 2013",2,Too many crashes Like the chrome version but the android app constantly locks up so is pretty much unusable.
339,Cesar Aurelio Plata Otavo,"July 17, 2013",1,No arranca En mi motorola razr i la aplicación no arranca. me solicita los datos de la cuenta y cuando trata de abrir la aplicación se cierra.
340,Tanya Litre,"July 27, 2013",5,Makes Life EASIER! Makes the boring stuff a lot easier.  I am very happy with this app!!
341,santhosh kumar,"July 4, 2013",4,"Good but no offline access I will give 5 stars if apps has offline access, when internet is not available."
342,John Collier,"July 11, 2013",4,Helpful complement to desktop Can see all data readily although record inputs and maintenance should stay w desktop.

But still... - The app does not send notifications (it needs to be manually refreshed). - It does not open when getting an email with notifications (instead of the insightly site). - I cannot see comments?  So it seems there's still a way to go to make this app useful indeed. I'd love to see this grow and add stars to my review!  Waiting... Sharon

I then went direct to the video tutorials and watched the entire presentation.  When it explained real time I was hooked.  I like the Idea of instant instruction and Chat to get help.  I have turned on 3 people to this sight and they like it also.  To bad most people dont understand the power of a CRM.  Mike
350,Paul Gomersall,"May 25, 2013",1,"Who the hell gives this more than 1star Hopefully this is just a place holder so they can say they've got an android app. Unwieldy, time consuming and gives little insight into your projects from the web app.  Look forward to numerous updates to get to a proper version 1.0"
351,Paul Nolan,"May 25, 2013",3,It's getting better but... Please make this app great.  Check out the new Google drive interface and work flow.

I'll order a subscription when you get this more polished. Also Google apps integrated login by enabling single sign on is confusing.  Took me awhile to figure it out -  I just enabled sso in the gapps administration panel -  I can login now but wonder if it is secure because the sso information page gives a lot of detail about third party server and host files etc.. Confusing
352,Jacob Berenfeld,"June 7, 2013",2," I hope it will be improved. As of now not user friendly. This app doesn't have Events, Calendar."
353,A Google user,"May 25, 2013",3,Improving We are big fans of the CRM. Happy that improvements are being made with the app. 3 stars until we're able to access all the linked files and emails we have within our contacts and opportunities. Keep up the good work.

Very pleased with the constantly updating information we can access from anywhere. Just switched from Act and signed up for the subscription.

355,Tony Solon,"May 29, 2013",3,Needs dashboard The app suffices. However there's one major missing piece - the dashboard. This is the quickest way to get an overview of all sales activities. Not having access to it on mobile - either Android or iOS - is disappointing.
356,Mark Barsocchini,"May 29, 2013",5,"Great app The functionality of having my office info with me on the road is terrific. We rely on Insightly to keep us connected on on task, having it mobile makes that even easier."
357,Alexey Aristov,"June 9, 2013",1,"Cannot login I'm receiving ""we did not recognize that email address"". Although l'm sure it is correct. I can login to the web site without any problem."
358,Allyson Ragland,"June 10, 2013",1,No organizations I can't get any of my organizations to show on the app. It's driving me nuts. I work on the road and have to have that! Please fix!
359,Douglas Krystosek,"June 19, 2013",5,Great CRM Tool! great CRM tool with simple and easy-to-use interface.
360,A Google user,"May 12, 2013",2,"Not bad, but needs work. Not bad for a first attempt, but not quite there yet: 1. Under Tasks, 'details' section shows HTML tags 2. No push notifications to app when you have new tasks or messages. This really defeats the purpose of having an android app. Push notifications to app > email notifications."
361,Joe Player,"May 8, 2013",1,"Data doesn't sync For some reason the app data doesn't sync with my cloud version so app is useless right now. I have a GS2, the interface looks nice an clean. Once this problem is solved it will rock."
362,Alex Günsberg,"May 10, 2013",3,"Call log missing Would be a five star app if it would log the call you make from it. The calls you make from the app, are not listed or recorded anywhere. Once you place a call the app closes, so it is also impossible to make notes during the call."

Very clunky to use - a simple creation of a new company and a contact is a multi step process of creating the both records separately then manually linking them - why?  Not to.mention that its probably poorly written - my tablet is slow and the app is well below the usability speed - one of those hit the button and hold for a second to react.  As much as I love the web app this is not ready
364,Simon Harvey,"May 10, 2013",4,"Promising Only just d/l it so still exploring. Some filtering would be nice (Projects view shows all projects, including completed ones, so you have to search). But a good start and nice to see Android platform being served. Facebook integration would be good too."
365,Jonathan McQueen,"May 17, 2013",5,"Great addition to the fantastic web app Simple and powerful, just like the web version. Thank you insightly!"
366,Mike Misbach,"May 13, 2013",4,"Just what I needed App works great, perfect for managing in the go. No complaints, but it would be nice to have more capabilities similar to online. No issues though."
367,A Google user,"May 15, 2013",4,Much better Developer team worked with me to fix some issues A+
368,Allan James,"April 29, 2013",5,"Impressive I have been evaluating just about every CRM program out there. So far, it appears insightly meets the challenge. I like the tab views versus one long list of events, history and tasks. I also like Opportunities and Projects. Android app is the icing on the cake !"
369,Glen Parker,"April 23, 2013",1,"No data? Something very wrong with this app. On my Galaxy S3 it doesn't load any data, making it somewhat pointless. Hopefully fixed soon but useless as is."

Using insightly is worse that tracking all of this information on paper while getting a root canal, I think a 4 year old with smoke signals could do a better job... the terrible workflow and user interface is only made worse by their incredibly horrid customer service.  this company won't be around very long, a 1 star rating is too high."
378,Hal Krisle,"June 17, 2014",1,"Too rudimentary Being able to search by tags would be a huge help! Otherwise I have to remember the name! Control what app opens to (tasks, contracts, etc). Love Insightly!"
379,Paul Colman,"April 11, 2014",1,"Big let down The desktop version is great, but this mobile app is a waste of time because there's so much functionality missing, and you have to manually refresh. When will a new version be launched?"
380,Rob Hillis,"April 10, 2014",1,"Terrible It will download to Nexus 5 but it wont open. Tried downloading and opening twice. Reviews were right, app needs work."
381,Bob Lowry,"July 26, 2015",1,Couldn't create account DL and tried to use but could not create an account.  Would only take Google apps login which I refuse to use.  Make it more universal and then maybe.  NEXT
382,Blue Lake Offroad,"November 8, 2016",4,"Overall very good CRM We've been using this app for several years, it increasingly improves. The support responses whenever we've had questions or issues have been good overall.  For most small businesses thid meets the needs and integrates very well with Google apps."
383,Alyssa Kirk,"October 18, 2013",1,"Virtually Useless I can't read any current tasks, there is no calender for me to reference, my contacts are old, etc. I have uninstalled but since I absolutely need this for work I am hoping a reinstall will help. Otherwise this just takes up space on my phone. Very frustrating."
384,Keith Milner,"November 18, 2015",5,"Needs lead management added The web application has lead management capabilities, but these are not visible on this app. View only would be better than nothing, but the ability to add new leads would be very useful, especially if the app allowed a lead to be added by scanning a business card."
385,Paul Spenard,"March 2, 2014",2,"Not as good as the desktop version I am happy with the desktop version of Insightly,  but this app needs a lot of work, from Push connectivity to integration with the mobile device."
386,MJ Mike Nelson,"April 28, 2013",5,Brilliant! If you fancy a CRM solutions that is easy to use and learn yet filled with brilliant functionality then look no further...insightly for Android is truly stunning
387,robert bepristis,"May 30, 2013",3,Great start to an app. I love that you finally have an app. It would be great if you can have the filters in the opportunities so you are not looking at this long list if everything you have even put in.  Also having attached files in the companies and contacts.
388,Keith Reed,"December 13, 2016",1,Ridiculous First off they make you sign up before you can even try the app. And for some reason  they want your phone number. Really!

After deciding to go ahead with it it won't except any email address saying they are invalid. Funny I've had them for years. To bad. After spending days looking for an app to manage my customers I really thought this was it. But I couldn't even get past the sign up. Crazy!

Now, a year since implementation, our initial assessment has been confirmed. Integration with Google Apps has been key to its usefulness to all our employees. The customization options makes Insightly as compatible with our firms needs as any of the other ""industry specific"" options we investigated.  Great app with even more potential as features and capabilities are added."

391,Kristin B,"January 10, 2018",1, STAY AWAY! Their customer service is terrible! Their marketing is also misleading - this product does not easily integrate with Gmail.
392,Herfinnur Árnafjall,"April 3, 2015",1,Only for Google for Work Giving it one star because they fail to mention anywhere (app description; homepage) that it only works with Google For Work.  I just spent over an hour before I managed to dig up enough info to surmise that from the total amount of vague clues
393,Aakash Dharmadhikari,"April 3, 2014",1,"Crashing every time First, it does not take standard google authentication. It asks me to explicitly log in.   After signing in, the allocation crashes. I tried uninstalling and installing again...  No luck."
394,Brian Fore,"February 6, 2017",2," The app will not let me update the status of projects or mark tasks as completed. This makes actually working from the app impossible, making it useless."
395,Jeffrey Leauby,"May 4, 2016",3,"5 Star Potential When Insightly updates the mobile app to integrate searchable tags for filtering purposes, this will be a 5 star application. Filters and tags are a core function of CRM and for this app to not have those features, it falls short."
