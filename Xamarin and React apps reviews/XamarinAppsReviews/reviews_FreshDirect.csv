App keeps crashing...won't allow me to enter the address (doesn't accept zipcode) or use PayPal without crashing. Extremely frustrating given the times and no delivery times available anyway it seems when my girlfriend tries to order on her app. Just wasted an hour putting together a cart and fighting with checkout.
2,A Google user,"April 22, 2020",2," Lots of crashing and freezing. With strong cell and wifi service, constant error message that app cannot connect. Very frustrating to use."
3,Lawrence Robinson,"March 1, 2020",3, Used to be a good app but since the February 2020 update it regularly becomes unresponsive and has to be closed when prompted. I have the same experience with both my phone and tablet.
4,Peter Withheld,"March 28, 2020",1," Choppy animations. Hard to make delete button appear in cart. Won't accept my address- says zip code not found, so I'm unable to complete my order and the app is useless. I'm also unable to finish adding an address on the website and this whole app feels like a prototype. Very frustrating."
5,Jennifer Golden,"March 25, 2020",1," Where to start....app constantly freezes (Google Pixel 3xl)...finally pushed through entering about 20 items... entering address keeps returning zio code not found over and over. Definitely entering correct zip code, they definitely deliver to my area as neighbors use them. Horrible app!!!!"
6,Cat Lee,"March 29, 2020",1, Just signed up. App won't load. Can't make my first purchase. Very poor first impression.
7,Jason Davies,"April 20, 2020",1," Love fresh direct, hate the app. It is always crashing."
8,Kara Burzynski,"March 4, 2020",1, Regularly stops responding. This was not an issue in previous versions.
9,siva koppireddy,"April 14, 2020",1, Worst app experience ...doesn't accept zipcode and what is the purpose of this app if it does not allow users to buy stuff? I go for web version which works fine.
10,Rob LaRosa,"March 9, 2020",2," Can't enter my address, for the first time. It tells me *all* NYC zip codes are unavailable and clears the field."
11,Amery Rock,"March 31, 2020",2, Terrible app. Things always disappear from my cart prior to checkout.
12,Tali Gutman,"April 13, 2020",1, Bug with identifying zip codes prevents from actually checking out with the app
13,Chris Lombardi,"March 20, 2020",1," Useless. Enter delivery address, nothing happens. Avoid."
14,Lorin Meeks-Harris,"March 20, 2020",1, APP works very slowly. I would highly avoid this APP based on my usage and the reviews of others. This business appears unprofessional. The Better Business Bureau should investigate.
15,Amelia Ehrens,"March 19, 2020",1, Won't even open past the welcome screen.
16,Monique Lowery,"January 18, 2020",3," Easy to navigate, but freezes on me often and can be slow to modify my selections once the order is placed. Also updates to multiple quantities sometimes, so check that you've only put one in your cart."
17,Edward Young,"December 6, 2019",2," App is broken. Will add multiple items to your cart even though you only selected one.

Customer support doesn't respond to email, even when then fail to ship items in your order but still charge you for them. Fresh direct used to be a quality service, but over the last 4 or 5 years they have been failing more than succeeding."
18,Andrea Rummans,"January 20, 2020",2," Zip code issue, doesn't matter what zip code I type it erases it all and asks me to re-enter it. Navigating the site was great. No problems anywhere else except for when it comes down to ordering."
19,Anthony Flores,"February 3, 2020",1, Does not allow me to input my address. It just keeps on loading
20,Huma Kamgar,"February 17, 2020",1, App cant find my New York zip code App shows prices in Â£ instead of $ Fkd up app

22,Alex Mills,"November 24, 2019",1," Will not let me move forward from address. ""Can't find my zipcode"" . Would not recommend this app"
23,Jonathan Corbett,"December 30, 2019",1, You guys suck for intentionally making your mobile site so annoying with ads to download the app that I'm forced to download this app that does nothing more than the mobile site.
24,Adam Clemence,"December 8, 2019",1," Seriously how is this so bad. ""Can't find your zipcode."" I'm trying to give you money and you made it impossible through the app."

My very first order never came. After I received a notification that my order was delayed by more than and hour and a half and was going to arrive after midnight, I called customer service to locate my purchase and they said ""a delivery attempt was made"" over the phone while in app the order was still saying ""en route"". After waiting (over 20 min in a queue) the associate couldn't even give me a straight answer as to the location of my groceries and I cancelled the order."
28,Alex ?,"March 15, 2020",2, App sucks. Littered with bugs. Delivery tracking is poor. Customer flow isn't intelligent enough. Lots to improve here folks. Food is great though.
29,David Fouch,"March 31, 2020",1," Tried to setup account. I'm not even able to shop. It asks for address before adding anything to the cart, but adding an address doesn't work. I had installed for 10 minutes before I removed."

31,Shawn Pritchett,"November 12, 2019",1," Shocking how much better competitor apps are. So much more intuitive. Sharper display. Problems scrolling when looking at my cart on this. Better invest in better technology. Not the only game in town anymore and these guys are out to eat your lunch. If you can't have a good app, you're done."
32,Breton Shindel,"June 9, 2019",1," This app is terrible.

The layout of everything is not helpful at all, you have to search every specific type of item you want, rather than displaying categories (meat, dairy, etc.), making it very easy to overlook items you need. I can't even put in my apartmrnt because their aufofill address and the manual address i give is aparently not valid. These people need to get it together."

Today, though, it's the last straw. So previously, the app would add some crazy amounts od items you only tapped once, and I learned it the hard way, after receiving 7 packets of dill, or 5 watermelons, I learned to carefully check the cart before checking out. The speed has also been not great. Today though, the app just won't let me log in saying ""no response received"". I reinstalled it, didn't help. Too bad."
34,Ivana M,"April 2, 2020",1, Can't enter zip code. Can't use WIC.

I almost went with another company entirely. Also, the hold that they put on your card looks like they charge twice. I'm not comfortable with that. I called to inquire but I'm still lacking trust now. Uninstalling."

40,Michael Denker,"May 5, 2019",1," Garbage. App is super glitchy and freezes up nearly every time, assuming you can even get it to load. When it crashes you lose everything in your cart... even though you were logged in. Fire your development team."
41,Wade Cook,"October 5, 2019",2, Great concept but not user friendly... Clicking the shopping cart icon doesn't bring you to the shopping cart and I can't figure out how to check out.
42,Dino Mytides,"October 23, 2018",1, For a digital first company you need to have an app that works. This turd crashes every few seconds. It's faster to go to the grocery store don't waste your time until they get this fixed.
43,Rakesh krishnan,"April 6, 2020",1, I didn't listen to these negative reviews . But boy they are true. Everything like adding groceries and address location started clocking. Removed tht app since it's a waste of space

72,Liquid Emeralds,"February 1, 2020",1, I saw that it lists nassau county as a delivery place but it will not recognize my zip code. It looked like it has a better variety of food than peapod but at least peapod allows you to use it.

365,A Google user,"September 15, 2012",1,"Fix it please! I use fresh direct for almost all my food shopping, it's so frustrating not to be able to use my nexus 7 for it. App is pretty bad on my galaxy s3 as well. Please work on it!"
366,A Google user,"July 22, 2012",1,Doesn't work For ICS or above this app is totally useless. I use fresh direct for all my shopping and it would be nice if you actually made an app that works. Hire a new developer or something and listen to them.
367,Michael West,"September 13, 2017",1, Good luck even entering your address. Sat the phone down for 30 minutes meanwhile the icon to find my address kept spinning. Haha never did a damn thing
368,David Coleman,"February 25, 2016",1,Garbage Cannot view anything without creating an account.  Tried to create an account automatically with my g+ login and the app imploded.  Now it won't even present the login screen.  It just shows the preloader spinning 4ever.  This is junk guys.  If you need a good programmer my rate is $120/hr
369,Brenda J.,"May 2, 2015",1,Didn't Work for me ð The app kept running on my Samsung Galaxy S5 acting as if it was installing but after about 3 minutes I gave up.  I'll see if the website will be a better option.  Good Luck.â
370,Andrew LoPinto,"January 19, 2013",1,"Pretty embarassing This app barely works.  Lack of tablet support is inexcusable.  All this is exasperated by the fact that their site is nearly unusable in the 3 major android browsers.  Pretty pisspoor considering there business model of convenient, premium food sold ON THE INTERNET."
371,A Google user,"July 29, 2012",4,"Need to open up app to tablets too! Easy to use app. Fast and simple. Makes it easy to order from previous orders as well. Works well on Samsung Epic 4g, but not compatible with the galaxy tab... c'mon!"
372,Candace Martin,"March 30, 2016",1,Same as everyone else Relied on the reorder function and now it's gone. Get that unable to connect thing too. Emailed them about it and they asked me for a screenshot of it. Are they not reading these comments?
373,A Google user,"November 9, 2012",3,Can't reduce quantity App doesn't allow me to reduce quantity to 0 of a previously ordered item. Very annoying. Otherwise UI pretty good.
374,Scott Zawalski,"May 31, 2016",1, Previous ordered items no longer works making this app close to useless for quick shopping. No caching of pages. This really is a poor excuse for an app.
375,auria ortiz,"July 26, 2014",1, Just shut it down and fix! Doesn't recognize my password or email. So much for convenience!
376,Oluha Ryu,"April 11, 2016",1,It's impossible to use it It's been months since the beginning of troubles...but nobody try to fix this app...it's a shame !
377,Marilyn Lion,"March 16, 2013",2,Doesn't sync with website Changes on app don't reflect online and vice versa. That goes for cart and reservations.
378,Florence M.,"February 23, 2018",1," Horrible. And then mobile site doesn't take some data. Boy, I wasted my golden 30 minutes until I read the reviews that confirmed it all!"
379,A Google user,"May 19, 2012",1," Like other GNex users, app crashes when I pick a product. Too bad."

log in info every time I momentarily left the app."
382,Caleb Epstein,"January 25, 2015",1,Zero Stars Crashes all the time on Nexus 5. Completely useless app.

388,Simone Brooker,"September 9, 2016",1, Waste of time ordering. Error msgs galore!
389,A Google user,"November 5, 2012",4,Good So convenient! Just don't like that it loads as I scroll through a search result.
390,A Google user,"September 30, 2018",1, It does not let me login. The App does not work.
