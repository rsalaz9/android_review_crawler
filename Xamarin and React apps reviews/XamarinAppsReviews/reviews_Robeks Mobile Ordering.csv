1,Sherri N,"March 23, 2020",1, Does not give the option to order retired smoothies. My robeks make me a retired smoothie but i have no way to order via the app.
2,A Google user,"March 30, 2020",5, Great way to order!
3,Michelle Waite,"April 14, 2020",5, Awsome drinks were ready and done correctly. Always yummy

But now when I try to type my username or password, the keyboard completely covers the user/password fields. So I cannot see what I am typing. I gave up."

Now it says items are no longer available when they're still offered in the store. Unfortunately, my store is super busy, except for the online ordering. The only way I can make it in and out of the store is with the benefits of the app. If it doesn't get fixed, I won't go back. Sorry to say, since Robeks does have the best smoothie menu."

I have been unable to, every time I type in my info and submit it, it gets cleared and nothing happens. Overly frustrated with this stupid app. I don't even know how many ""robeks dollars"" I have missed out on! Now downloading the jamba juice app... only because this app fails completely!"
7,Blu Sondai,"November 19, 2019",1, More problems when ordering than necessary. Transaction fail for false reasons.
8,Daveena Erunez,"November 24, 2018",4, I love how easy it is to use the app to order and even list what time you will be picking up I just wish there was pictures of the items so you can have an idea of what you might want to try!
9,Bryan Hader,"July 23, 2019",1," Robeks app was great until latest update. I can no longer substitute an ingredient, such as whey protein for pea protein without having to pay extra. The last app iteration allowed this. i can do this in store without getting charged extra. Are you squeezing us for extra cash now?"
10,Ciji McBride,"June 29, 2019",3, App worked for a while but the latest update either says my item isn't available or that I can't checkout. Please fix this
11,Andre Wade,"July 26, 2019",1," terrible app, wont let me login keeps asking about paytronics everytime I try to login worst app ever."
12,Janell Sings,"December 14, 2018",5, Finally they updated it and made it think smarter and move faster!

17,Andy Hess,"July 19, 2019",5," acai Energizer hands-down the best smoothie, add a extra shot of fiber."
18,Rick C,"April 20, 2019",1, horrible.. who designed this app. I ordered . showed up at the store and it sent it to a store 50 miles away .. then no one at the store had no idea how to cancel the order. tried one more time. took 28 minutes to get my order. so under staffed.

26,Lorenzo Butts,"September 30, 2019",5," Great app except for the pickup time option. I selected to have my order 
ready immediately since I was in the parking lot. It delayed another 12 
minutes."

36,Anacani Mateo,"May 16, 2018",5," This was my first day using this App. I've been a frequent customer but I

am very skeptical of Apps in general. What I love so far is that it tells 
me where my nearest locations are. I will also be using it to minimize wait 
time, I usually go to the Culver City location. I LOVE that the ladies that 
work here don't have long glittery nails and are always full of energy. 
Everyone is friendly and energetic. Keep it CULVER CITY!"
37,Jordan Davenport,"May 4, 2018",5," Works like a charm! The manager(i believe) recommended this app to me as i 
frequently come in. I love this! It's super convenient, easy to use, you 
can add all the normal options to your drink, and pay right then. Allows 
for quick pick ups and skipping those long lines in the busy summer months!"
38,Jessica Perez,"April 7, 2018",5," I placed my order online and I added extra peanut butter on my acai bowl, and they gave me call within 2 minutes to confirm if I wanted it mixed in or on top. Who else does that???? Great service!!! FYI- the nutty acai is delicious!ðŸ’‹"
39,VISIONS By ANNA CORRAL,"May 16, 2018",5," I work on the go and I need help throughout the day to maintain stamina and 
energy for long endurance to play keep up and this is a great place to get 
my daily needs met!"

44,Jonas Polsky,"July 4, 2018",5, Very convenient
45,John Spohn,"February 2, 2018",4," This app is disappointing as it doesn't show the Camarillo location. I tried both the list and the map as there is nothing for Camarillo, California."
46,Adam Sklar,"January 31, 2018",5," I love this app, it's super easy to use and my shakes are ready by the time I get to the store.  What more can you ask for :)"
