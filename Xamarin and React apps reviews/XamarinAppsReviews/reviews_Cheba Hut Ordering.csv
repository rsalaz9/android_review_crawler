The delivery boy also didn't want to give me my change back and made such a big deal about getting me my change? I even tipped him? Just leaving this here in case someone is downloading this so they can order from that location.

That few cents could mean between someone getting an overage charge in their bank account or not. I suggest you fix this immediately. Also the total on the website for my order is different than what's on the receipt."
34,B D,"January 28, 2017",5," Super easy to use, everything including tip can be paid with by card.  Makes for a quick dropoff.    One thing though, the ""save card to file"" option isnt clear.  Does the light dot on the left mean yes or is it the dark dot on the right?"
35,Josiah Marhenke,"January 29, 2017",4," App needs to tell you if the store is closed or not delivering before you enter your full order. Delivery or pickup option should be first, for that reason. Other than that it's great."
