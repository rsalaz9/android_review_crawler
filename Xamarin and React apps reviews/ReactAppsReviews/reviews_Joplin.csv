What makes it the best for me is that it's open source, and the community updates it over time, which I've found has fixed a lot of the issues I've had. I keep the app despite current issues I have (a memory leak where the app slows down when used with Gboard; Gboard getting confused when i cut text out the app and it deletes some text, etc.) in the hope that it will get fixed in time."

But in the android app the typing starts to lag after a while of writing continuously, making it almost unusable. - this is MAJOR problem unless you use it just for short notes. Also, the undo button not there. Someone please fix this.. Joplin is too good a project to be broke by such a petty issue. Pretty please."
2,Noman Zargar,"April 21, 2020",5," Perfect app. Please fix the positioning of Arabic script. English should appear from left to right & Arabic should be from right to left. But in the viewing mode, Arabic appears left-to-right, unlike the editor, which positions Arabic perfectly from right to left."
3,Yigal Ziskand,"April 18, 2020",5, Enjoying the app very much. Simple and clear interface. The app is very stable and updates are actively pushed to users in very short cycles. Syncing between mobile and desktop works just fine. And finally the black theme makes is perfect for intense desktop usage.
4,R. L.,"April 21, 2020",5, Currently broken. Unable to view / edit long notes while in edit mode. Had to temporarily switch to Nextcloud notes. Hope that this issue gets fixed soon. Edit: Above issue has been corrected.

6,Ritesh Jain,"April 20, 2020",5," This is a fantastic app, thanks to all the developers. Sync works, no limitations, FOSS, E2EE encryption, available on all platforms including linux- all the praise comes short! Kudos!"

9,Mark Renier,"April 21, 2020",5, Best notes and tasks handle. Updated frequently. Responsive forum and developers. Thanks guys!

Just two things to point out: ‚ë¥ The app I abandoned in favour of Joplin allowed me to move list items up and down via touch. If that functionality could be added to the view mode that would save heaps of time in edit mode. ‚ëµ On Android scrolling in edit and view mode feels different. In edit mode the scrolling stops as soon as I lift my finger off the screen. Adopting the view mode scrolling here would be great! Thanks!"

There are no font size controls for anything (notebook's list of notes, note's body, etc) To me this is essential, specially when the standard font size is small. 'The UI font for the create note/list is beyond small. This is a minor issue but just pointing it out."
12,Jackal Xenial,"April 13, 2020",4," Excellent, probably the most complete multiplatform notation, it's missing a widget."
13,Yobel S.,"April 18, 2020",5, Hands down my favorite open-source note taking app for both windows and Android. Kudos to you devs! Keep up the good work!!! üëè
14,Brian Sepolen,"April 7, 2020",2," Lost ability to create note just by sharing from web browser. Now, all sharing to Joplin does, is open the app. Disappointed that there is no 32-bit Linux experience. Back when I could share from web browser, the page title was not being captured."
15,Glenn Reilly,"March 14, 2020",4," One of my fav apps, I use this daily. I think sharing from Chrome to joplin no longer works though, sadly. Tried it from both tablet (Samsung s5e) and phone (pixel 3 xl), just opens joplin, doesn't seem to create a new note any more."
16,theodoreippon,"March 23, 2020",4," An amazing all in one note app!!! The only thing i would like to see, is a revamp to the ui to be a bit more pleasant and user friendly! Then 5 stars from me!!!! Keep up the great work guys!!!"
17,Brent Collins,"March 9, 2020",4," Great app, wish it had sub notes. Notes that you could attach to another note. So that if you had a idea you could add notes that would go with it. Similar to wiki websites with interlinking documents"
18,Malcolm Bee,"March 25, 2020",2," Was thinking this could be a replacement for Google Keep but then when I went to edit a checkbox list on Android phone I had to enter the markdown symbols, surely I'm missing something! On the PC the symbols are entered when editing a list."
19,Ankan,"March 25, 2020",5, Feels really good to have Joplin finally. This opensource warrior can be at peace and enjoy all its functionalities. It's perfect for documenting and have it synced across all my devices and BE IN CHARGE OF MY DATA! Love to the devs. :)
20,Christopher Huddleston,"March 22, 2020",1," Used to use it quite a bit. Great secure app and great editing capabilities, but that all goes down the drain if the app crashes about 1min into opening it."
21,Tommi Boom,"April 12, 2020",5, Joplin is an awesome feature-packed OpenSource app developed with passion constantly and frequently. Any bug is fixed quickly. Great Community.
22,Mathew Pinard,"March 8, 2020",5," Mermaid diagram support is awesome! One thing is that the background of the diagram will show as white even in dark mode, but if you scroll sideways it won't be white."
23,Rob Suto,"April 16, 2020",2, Crashes whenever I try to use backspace to delete.
24,Helmi Sugandi,"March 24, 2020",5, I think its the best markdown note for now and thanks for support Linux. Add Google Drive please. My Dropbox account have less storage than Google Drive.
25,Wesley Kenyon,"April 7, 2020",2, Normally a 5 star app but sharing links to Joplin is broken. Will update to 5 stars when it is fixed.
26,Charlie Feng,"April 15, 2020",4, Would be nice if when user presses back button can show notebook list instead of just quit the app
27,Daniel Truong,"March 23, 2020",5, Bug from latest update. Some notes are blackout when in edit mode. I use dark theme. Please fix.
28,P Lo,"April 1, 2020",1," After the latest update, it can no longer do sharing with android."
29,Todd Smith,"March 18, 2020",1, Can't sync to external SD card. Known issue with no resolution.

No tablet/Chromebook interface to speak of (it just gets wider), limited interface options, and basically looks generic. Shame, because the desktop version is excellent. If you primarily use Joplin on the desktop and just want to access your notes occasionally on mobile, it'll get the job done. If you're big on mobile note-taking, Evernote or other tools will do a lot more for you."
41,Bryan Parks,"February 21, 2020",5," I've been looking for a good OneNote competitor, since I use Linux on my desktop. I'm so glad that I finally found Joplin. There is a bit of a learning curve, since you have to use markdown for the notes, but it isn't too bad. The app runs well and synchronization with Dropbox is awesome."

Backup from mobile, not as necessary but for those who just use this app for mobile, would be nice. Syntax highlighting is another feature rarely ever offered. I sometimes get confused knowing where I'm at in the note without it. I have a lot of html code and junk that makes the note render nice in read view but ugh.. you'll need a map in write mode. Lol. The best note app period"

However, the encryption interface is confusing, and it displaying the markdown code for images when editing isn't very user-friendly. It would also be great if the key oars went away automatically when tapping the breadcrumb menu to take a photo - saves an extra tap. Overall a solid app though, couldn't recommend enough."
45,Kumar,"January 30, 2020",5, This is a great app. But please add these features on Android that are supported on the Desktop version: 1. Themes 2.

47,Alex Fuglsang,"February 28, 2020",5," Love this app, after trying Evernote, Onenote and Simplenote (another excellent app) Joplin is my favourite in its useablilty and features. It's also free and syncs across Mac, Android, Windows and Linux. A spell checker on the desktop app would be an awesome addition."

Markdown is something I can get used to, but this may not be suitable for non-geeks. However, because of the framework the app is a bit bulky and lacks some features like background sync.

I also appreciate the reworked, clean design. In Joplin you compose notes in Markdown and the app saves those in a format that can be read by any text editor.

The app supports many ways to sync your notes to the cloud and also includes a possibility to encrypt your data."

61,Emma Hryniewicz,"December 24, 2019",4," Joplin is an amazing Evernote alternative. It needs a little more work to set up, but it allows me to use more devices than basic evernote. I'm only rating it 4 stars because it keeps being buggy on encrypted syncing despite following the encrypted syncing instructions to the letter."
62,Pragyan Shrestha,"March 5, 2020",4, 1. Lags. Optimization needed. Becomes very difficult to continue after inserting few images and typing some equations. 2. No 'code block' display in Android app?

69,RexurGaming,"December 21, 2019",5," Would highly recommend! So, to explain, my Phone completely stopped working and I lost a lot of my data on it. But to my surprise, I found out that Joplin saved all of my notes!! Thank god for this feature."
70,Foxpaws Studios,"January 11, 2020",4, On the mobile app I can't find a way to create sub-folders or export as .TXT or .pdf files. Please find a way to do it! Other than that it's a perfect cross platform application!

82,Thanos Athanasopoulos,"December 22, 2019",5," The developers thought exactly what I was looking for: a tree oriented notes app with markdown, multiplatform and secure. No other app is alike and works like a charm."
83,Bhaveek Desai,"December 29, 2019",5, Finally! A personal notes app that is cross compatible with Linux and gives me control over where my notes are saved without worrying about my data being snooped.

Joplin has allowed me to go one step further even: fully decentralized multi device synchronization via Syncthing‚Äîno 3rd party or new accounts to manage needed whatsoever! Like Evernote, Joplin even provides a web clipper for the major browsers. It's not quite perfect yet though: using Markdown takes some getting used to, and the client could use some polish to bring it in line with Evernote or Simplenote; the configuration menu in particular could do with an overhaul. I'd also like to see enhanced features such as lines with check boxes moving to the bottom of the list when checked, for example for shopping lists. Development is very active so over time I'm convinced Joplin will work its way up to a full 5 star rating. Joplin is 100% free, so anyone looking for an Evernote replacement would do well to look at Joplin. And don't forget: free does cost money, so please make a donation to the dev if you find Joplin useful!"

I started with onenote, back in the day, when I was still a windows user. For some reasons, I had to shift to Linux, and all of my notes were gone.

These apps are fantastic too. But, oh man, nothing is like Joplin. It has all features you might need for an academic use. Markdown support helps you to write your math notes. You'll be able to do screenshots. It's very easy to format your notes with least amount of effort. You can have it in all OS's, which is brilliant. That means, you're not gonna lose any note anymore."

164,Vitor Santos,"September 3, 2019",3," Nice app. But using Markdown for formatting notes in 2019 is like going back in time.

uses Dropbox. Works well and tested on Android, Linux and windows."
320,A Google user,"August 5, 2018",5," Syncs to nextcloud server and encrypts. No extra bs plus supports markdown. 
Mobile and desktop apps showing updated features. Keep up the great work!"
321,A Google user,"July 22, 2018",5," Love this open source, cross device note app."
322,A Google user,"July 11, 2018",5, Love the app. Perfect replacement for tomboy and evernote.
323,Maxime Libsig,"July 12, 2018",5, great app. remimders don't work for me.
324,Dorin Chiritoiu,"June 15, 2018",5," Awesome app! Everything is perfect. No problem synching my notes with my 
linux machine. Don't have any problem working with markdown. It's an 
impressive app and it is worth mentioning that's open source!"
325,tj kn,"May 20, 2018",5," Please add sharing ability with Google products like Keep, Calendar, etc"
326,Andrew Raisbeck,"June 3, 2018",5, With the suicide of Instapaper. Joplin has an even greater significance
327,Helmut K. C. Tessarek,"May 3, 2018",5," I finally found a great note taking app. There are still a few improvements 
to be made, but I can recommend this app without hesitation. Keep up the 
great work!"
328,james pkfbea,"May 5, 2018",5, I think I've found the note taking app I was looking for since.
329,A Google user,"May 3, 2018",5," Markdown, sync, cross platform, high quality."
330,Lucius Hammock,"April 30, 2018",5, Awesome! I have never seen a better app for note keeping!
331,Mike Chilson,"May 1, 2018",5, Great open source alternative
332,Joshua Needham,"April 10, 2018",5," So far this app is magnificent! Very streamlined yet powerful, streamline yet feature rich. Definitely happy to have found it."
333,Tom Grady,"April 20, 2018",4," There have been huge improvements over the last few months. I use it with 
Nextcloud syncing because it is much more robust than the Nextcloud notes 
app."
334,James Enloe,"April 6, 2018",4," The notes app I've been looking for. Like Simplenote on steroids. Markdown support with the ability to add images and files to notes is fantastic. Using Dropbox sync between my Pixel 2 XL, Windows 10 desktop and Windows 10 laptop has worked great thus far. Really happy I stumbled across this app!"
335,A Google user,"March 17, 2018",5, But but... Where is the local fs synchronization ?
336,Andy Cowley,"March 14, 2018",3, Nextcloud webdav sync seems to crash the app after 4 or 5 items. Struggling with it at the moment. Onedrive works fine
337,A Google user,"March 9, 2018",5, needs nextcloud sync or at least obligatory local sync
338,Joseph Genther,"March 14, 2018",2, Not ready to replace Evernote. The usability and list of features is missing most of what I need.
339,A Google user,"March 13, 2018",5, Great alternative to Evernote
340,Clint Walker,"March 4, 2018",5," The fact that one can produce tables on an Android device puts this ahead of Evernote, Dropbox Paper, Google Keep."
341,The Solamnic,"February 13, 2018",5, This is a great app with an active developer. No complaints.
342,Uldis Segli≈Ü≈°,"December 11, 2017",3," Kudos for opensourcing. Too cluttered interface. Lists should be visible right away, not hidden under some invisible menu layer. I need my lists at the touch of one button, when I'm at the store. Either at lockscreen or as widgets. Now I have to start the app, navigate to some list, open it."
343,Asmer Mlaƒáo,"December 16, 2017",3," Not bad, still buggy. Welcome page is useless. Editing notes are not done OK. Sometimes you don't see the text you're editing if a note is long."
344,Tim Morrison,"December 14, 2017",3, As a mobile app the fact that you can't share/clip items into the app from other apps is a deal breaker. Too cumbersome workflow wise to use. Plus the add photo from the gallery doesn't work anyway.
345,Carlos Miller,"January 5, 2018",4, I think this is a great start. I've been using Simplenote which is also great but I like the features here a bit better.  I hope that you'll continue to develop this in the future.
346,Aditya Avhad,"December 12, 2017",5, Can you add an amoled theme?    So far the app is great with all synchronization options found this app on omgubuntu
347,Hypno Buddha,"December 18, 2017",4," Worked for a short time with only a few items imported from Evernote, but once I added it stopped syncing properly. Very promising though!"
348,Alen Mazinga,"December 3, 2017",3," For me, the main reason for dropping Evernote is Microsoft.

As so, I would prefer another sync option and not just One Note (Mega for example, cause privacy is important and people who don't want Microsoft, don't want also Dropbox). I would love to see also some character settings, as I like to have some notes in fonts, that are monospaced like f.e. Courier. I like the GUI and think the dark theme is really a nice option."
349,John Lang Wilson,"December 4, 2017",5," Excellent, imported all my notes from Evernote via Linux/Ubuntu. Notes now visible on my Android gizmos. A really useful Application."
350,Kou Yong Kang,"November 30, 2017",5, Looks really promising as an Evernote replacement. Would be great if it can sync via the built-in file manager so that I can use my Seafile instance instead of Onedrive.
351,Amy H.,"December 2, 2017",3, This app is great but I need chromebook compatibility to make either 5 stars. Great on windows and Linux though.
352,nicola muneratto,"December 1, 2017",4, Finally a Evernote open source  alternative and supports markdown .  Bravo!
353,Douglas Brown,"November 29, 2017",5," A good start. I look forward to seeing how this app develops over time.

For me, killer features of Evernote are the Web Clipper and being able to send Web pages to an email address (to be auto add the page contents to a notebook). Once Joplin approaches that feature set, I'll seriously consider dumping Evernote (saving their monthly Premium fees)."
354,Frost Toast,"November 30, 2017",4, It is a good app but there some problems that i noticed. For instance            i cant scroll down if i wrote a long note. I think if you add syncronizing through your email that would be great

356,Srijal Joshi,"November 30, 2017",5, Very well done. Great features and love the multi-platform support!
357,danang lanang,"November 30, 2017",2, Can't attach image from gallery or camera

I later learn ODB not supported. That's my use case, so app not useful to me. Also, weird screen size fit for iPad Pro 12.9. Otherwise, no complaints. Developer seems very responsive to issues.  Couldn't get it to sync at all with iOS or MacOS and OneDrive Business. 2 stars for great concept, definitely addresses a pain point with the need for iOS, MacOS and Android syncing to OneDrive Business, but can't get it to work."
360,Roy Markham,"January 25, 2018",3, Not sure why an open-source app doesn't have OwnCloud support. I'm not interested in Microsoft one drives. Thanks for the effort anyways.
361,Varun Bhatta,"April 18, 2019",3," good open source app. however found the UI to be but non intuitive. also, having no web interface forces to install app in desktop too."
362,Mike Girard,"August 31, 2018",5," Saving is a little clunky, if we could get a little better back button functionality it would be nearly perfect"
