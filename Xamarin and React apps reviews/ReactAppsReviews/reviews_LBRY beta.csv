Five stars when you make that available, many people watch video only on those platforms. I rarely use Android or PC to watch videos, the TV is the way to go. Good work, keep the progress going! I'm enjoying an alternative uncensored video platform where you can speak your mind, or listen to someone else and not be banned."

2,Boss Chad,"March 27, 2020",5," This app is a great start for YT alternatives, needs a comment section, customized themes and optimization for mobile data as the load time is dismal, but this is beta so I expect bugs and stuff, great work, I hope LBRY is a huge success.

Edit: You devs need to step it up and fix the app, I don't even use it because it's unuseable, nothing loads, can't watch any videos at all, just a spinning circle, In a few weeks I'm going to start subtracting stars if you dont fix it."
3,Charles Head,"March 29, 2020",1," Probably the poorest performing app on my phone (Pixel 2). I like the LBRY service, but this app is severely lacking in quality. UI response time is horrible.

UI response time is horrible. Even opening the menu takes several seconds. Videos are laggy, and initialization takes forever. It's missing much of the basic functionality you would expect in a content streaming app. Maybe this is the price the users pay to make pennies (or less) per day in crypto. Makes me wonder if that's how the devs were paid."
4,The Solamnic,"April 19, 2020",4," Nice to see an option pop up that is becoming a viable alternative to YouTube in regards to content. That being said, would be nice to see some features in the app like dark mode and selection for different resolutions. The Android app is still in beta and it has really been shaping up."
5,Brett Munson,"March 27, 2020",1," FAIL!!! No problem signing in from my laptop, but when I try with the app, all I get is ""ERROR"", full stop. If I can't access my subscribed content with this app, then the app is useless. Please fix it."
6,CM E,"April 8, 2020",2," It doesnt work very well yet. Long load times, audio from video plays after you close the app. I've had to restart my phone to get it to stop. Maybe it will be usable someday."
7,Atiagooq,"April 11, 2020",1," sucks soo bad... Just made and account then a video started playing and are downloading the same video.. so we have to download EVERY VIDEO TO WATCH??? After closing the app and resetting it I lost my crypto. I logged back in and no more ""money""... what kind of bs is that? also ITS SLOW AF!"
8,Don Paschal,"March 28, 2020",3," I would use this app more often if it were easier to connect to the servers, especially at times when you have slowed-down data. This app has been up for month WITH UPDATES and you have not figured this out."
9,Priyanshu Chatterjee,"April 24, 2020",5," Great app! Good interface, support and facilities. And above all, the content freedom! Thanks and keep it up and being better by the days!"
10,ian paul Saringan,"April 15, 2020",1," Very difficult to use becauss of its slowness. Many videos doesn't seem to play, and took me a lot of time waiting."
11,Darren B,"March 29, 2020",3, Would like to see automatic full screen when phone is horizontal. Also a double tap to fast forward or rewind would be great.
12,Bonic Gamer,"February 13, 2020",3," The app needs more work.

When I open the app it starts to download whatever video was last playing without me pressing the download button, and the downloads stack, so now I have two videos that try to download when I open the app. Another issue is that sometimes when I switch from a video to another, the first video continues playing even when I close out everything and tap ""stop"" on the background service, and the only way that I know to stop it is to restart. Also dark mode please :)"
13,WolvesBoosted Channel,"April 11, 2020",2, I'm experiencing a playback error even after I close the app. Just letting you know here. Thanks
14,Aidan Taniane,"February 15, 2020",3," Technologically brilliant, but the app is in much need of polish, startup time is excessively long, battery consumption is off the rails, which forces me to kill the background process and go through the startup routine when I want to access it again.

And whether following list loads is a bit of hit or miss."
15,Simon Schubert,"February 29, 2020",3, The app became extremely slow on startup(10-15 seconds until meta data appears) and about 5-10 seconds in between button click and screen change.

It's probably the worst performing app on my phone. On a pixel 2. Beside that I love LBRY and hope for updates or a rewrite of the app in pure kotlin instead of that Java and react mixup.
16,SoothingTouch WellnessCenter,"February 9, 2020",1," App was running in the background non-stop since installing, and this was after ""closing the app""!

I had zero apps running, yet this was still in drop down list. When I finally got it killed, I could access internet at a decent speed... I can only imagine how much of my files/personal data & info it was accessing. After uninstalling my S9 Plus is running at a normal speed, not sitting stalled between screens, etc."
17,josh mizzi,"April 19, 2020",4," Cool app, the content seems a bit limited at the moment but looking farward to where it goes."
18,Chuffpup,"February 7, 2020",1," Pretty bad. I've tried to install it about six times! and it crashes. In the crash report it appears to say it's a fake app... Is this due to a playstore problem, , or have I made some stupid mistake? The online lbry tv experience hasn't impressed me, and I'm fed up with this fake app business. Sham...Full ReviewPretty bad. I've tried to install it about six times! and it crashes. In the crash report it appears to say it's a fake app... Is this due to a playstore problem, , or have I made some stupid mistake? The online lbry tv experience hasn't impressed me, and I'm fed up with this fake app business. Shame, because I wanted to ""see what the fuss was about"". Pissed off."
19,Peter Tomov,"March 2, 2020",4," Pretty much the whole service appeals to me. One of the best things? You can simply let it play in the background or download and play on the road right out of the box. Now once enough people create content on here, YouTube will be dethroned for many users."
20,Dave Thomas,"February 12, 2020",3, Uses power and data while running in background. Not quite as good as YouTube yet. Looking forward to it being as good or better...search functions need work. YouTube has killed some of my favorite channels. We need this competition!!!!
21,David,"February 29, 2020",5," Absolutely love LBRY! This platform has the potential to be a true YouTube alternative because it is innovative and powerful. Love that i can not only publish videos, but also audio, PDFs, and other media file formats. Truly dynamic."
22,dotMavriQ,"February 8, 2020",4," I love the ambition, the freedom that you get from the service. It still suffers from some quirks, but I'm holding out to see more users on the service. It's conceptually too good to not succeed"
23,Maxim,"February 9, 2020",3," Really like the project, but the buffering makes it pretty much unusable in Russia. Maybe it's a server issue or some weird isp throttling, but I would have to postpone using it until it's somehow resolved"
24,Nina Carroll,"February 29, 2020",3," I love having the free app. However, my connection gets interrupted quite frequently. And, I would love to give a review of the site I am viewing. There seems to be no place I could leave a message. Thanks"
25,AIM,"April 10, 2020",5, Very cool opensource alternative to other streaming platforms...!
26,Ismael J Cintron,"March 14, 2020",2," Not stable enough, lack common features. Sometimes videos lag, no comment section, no way to speed up the video, screen rotation to only one side."
27,Myles,"February 12, 2020",2, Cool app - I have high hopes for this. But doesn't play content in the background so not a competitor for YouTube in its current state.
28,Guyt2001 Terra Lord controller,"March 30, 2020",4," i like the update with ""show lbc also as usd"" but can you make it to show in ojr currency as, no matter where we are from?"
29,Fredrik Lindgren,"March 22, 2020",3, Great idea! Good execution! The app however lacks a few features. Let's start with these 2 and when they're implemented I'll update my review: 1) View speed 2) Dark theme
30,JanicekTrnecka,"March 4, 2020",3," Works as supposed to but lot of fine tuning is in todo list. EG what in app makes it 100MB big? I can understand that as its p2p based..but thats data,not the app size."
31,Mark Steele,"April 3, 2020",3, Your servers don't seem capable of supplying demand. Perhaps lower the quality of video will help. I thought LBRY was going to copy all our YT subscriptions over?
32,Nate Thompson,"February 29, 2020",5," Great app! Love finding my linux content easily, as well as being able to reward the content creators I love."
33,Sergey Koval,"February 15, 2020",3, Nice app. Sometimes works a bit slow. Waiting for dark mode in Android app. Also comments are not showing up in this app.
34,sunshine in thee city,"April 20, 2020",5," It is a great service to get paid. It is a bit slow, but you are paid. Once people join, the service will get better."
35,Dar DaMonk,"February 16, 2020",1, Unbelievably slow. The app is tedious and the desktop version has tried to change my IP address multiple times. Stick to YouTube or Twitter.
36,Patrick Parkins,"April 21, 2020",5," Absolutely thrilled that this exists, going full native will make it even better."
37,Jacqueline Oneill,"March 11, 2020",2, Like the content. But cant get any of the videostoplay. It just spins loading circles.
38,Jay Bowman,"March 19, 2020",5, Fun is allni hot for this app. Must be patient though it moves ay the speed of dial up sometimes.
39,AL Sutton,"February 25, 2020",5, Good app. Needs more development. Needs chromecast support.
40,Gunaa Athiraj,"February 24, 2020",5, Best app for content creators and viewers. If you guys searching alternative of youtube for your video monetization try LBRY.
41,Danila Solianichenko,"February 8, 2020",4," While being a recent in terms of just showing videos, this app still lacks in functionality."
42,Baschdel,"April 10, 2020",5," Still a bit slow, but this will most probably change in the future"
43,Spirits war,"February 4, 2020",1, Lbry is the worst platformer in existence! It needs to replace youtube and that's not the case at all! Account verification is awful! I do not recommend it to anyone!
44,M.G Redemptor,"February 5, 2020",5, awesome but needs some basic modern features (obviously)
45,lenny,"April 8, 2020",5, it has severe performance issues but i like the service and don't want to destroy the rating
46,Noah The Troll-Hunting Christian Spy,"February 22, 2020",5, LBRY certainly is more profitable and creator-friendly. I prefer it over the copyright-riddled wasteland that is Youtube.
47,Peter Mitchell,"February 16, 2020",5," Great app for a beta. Great alternative for YouTube, since YouTube is heavily censored."
48,Sean Hickey,"April 23, 2020",4, Kinda slow and laggy but heyy it's good content!
49,Zoey *,"February 27, 2020",1," Not working always buffering on videos really slow ,fix ok"
50,Petless Darrell,"March 16, 2020",5, Latest update results in jerky framerate on full screen video
51,Keith Trigwell,"April 13, 2020",5, Quality video streaming app. Love it
52,Rusty Heckler,"January 10, 2020",2," Nothing in the way of buffering. Using this on cellular wifi is painful. A few seconds of video plays and back to loading for a few minutes.

A few seconds of video plays and back to loading for a few minutes. This is consistent with every video and can take up to 20minutes to get through a 5 to 10 minute video. There's no clear way to download a video and the lack of a comment section. Yeah, I know, YT comments section is pure cancer, but it is also a part of its winning strategy, that interactivity between audiences and creators is actually important."
53,J knowledgenet,"November 25, 2019",3," I have continued to use this the last 4 to 5 min TV's to at least sign in and connect my daily reward, but that's usually as far as I can get due to it taking no less than 10 minutes in between videos to load.

Love I started in a previous comment tho I will continue to support any app for free speech. 100% I will support it till death due us part."
54,Francois Johl,"February 4, 2020",4, Loading is still a bit slow
55,Ricardo Lopez,"January 22, 2020",2, Love that its controlled by block chain but the app runs really slow and needs to be made faster.

Too much lag time and hard to understand how to really get started. Once these things are fixed I will be uploading more often but I already synced to my you tube so I will see how that turns out once it's done.
56,Daniel Sheffield,"December 25, 2019",5," So far so good. Has potential for sure. As long as it TRULY maintains a fundamentally FREE SPEECH platform. Video seems great. Posts/Posting will take getting used to. The navigation will too, but I like it so far. Worth a try. 5 Star for a Beta platform. :-)"
57,Harsh Sharma,"January 28, 2020",3," Videos are not even opening. Just keeps loading. Uninstalling this app for now, till then I'll be playing videos in browser. Now I will install this app when it goes from Beta to live stage."
58,msw465,"March 29, 2020",3, Not easy to navigate
59,Johnny Begood,"December 26, 2019",2," Very laggy and unresponsive, please fix. I will change my review if I see improvements. Update: The app is getting better, it's more responsive, and less laggy, but still needs improvements, I'm excited to see what it becomes in the near future."
60,Peter Stein,"January 24, 2020",2," compared to youtube apps (including privately developed) this is a very long way behind in both options/functtionality and efficiency/speed.

61,MotocrossLovers,"February 19, 2020",5, Lovely app i start using them for content freedom! @mototubeSRB
62,Joe Covill,"December 10, 2019",5," Not really sure how the back end stuff on this app works. I like it for the content. Sometimes new content seems slow to stream, but maybe that's because of not enough peers? Pretty good app though for not having to pay or set anything up."
63,Austin Goodman,"December 16, 2019",3," overall a positive experience but not great. I want the next step after YouTube. I attempted posting a video and struggled to do that, the interface is so clunky, it is difficult to sort or effectively navigate content."
64,Mujtaba Papu,"January 8, 2020",1, Verification process is very shocking. For India Mobile verification is not supported 1st option is of no use. 2nd option is Discord verification even after doing all things as per guidelines verification gets failed in the end just 3rd option is left that is one has to verify the account through Vi...Full ReviewVerification process is very shocking. For India Mobile verification is not supported 1st option is of no use. 2nd option is Discord verification even after doing all things as per guidelines verification gets failed in the end just 3rd option is left that is one has to verify the account through Visa Credit/Debit card which charges $1. I don't want to give my Credit card details so it proves to be a time waste app for me.
65,user73o1u 81716,"January 30, 2020",5," Not as good and convenient and intuitive as YouTube yet, but it's the best alternative. Highly recommended"
66,Troy Gray,"November 12, 2019",5, Haven't came across any issues yet but it's only been installed for about 2 weeks... so far so good. The more people involved the more content will be available I'm sure. I would like to see more content published by the LBRY team also.
67,Halcyon,"February 13, 2020",1, Need to force stop the app every day because videos don't stop playing.
68,Sheliky Sanchez,"February 23, 2020",5," Love it so far, noob so i just need to learn navigating a little more."
69,Kūgis Mūgis,"January 14, 2020",3," Love the idea, but app still needs work. Sometime app gets bugged and doesn't stop event after closing the app. I wish it had comments section. Browsing and searching for new content experience could be improved too."
70,R P,"January 11, 2020",3, Very laggy on my device. Shame pc app doesn't work at all for me. Not even starting 😭 I love the idea and wait for the future update. I'm also missing black background on android app. Also referral link is visible only via website.
71,Mirza Borogovac,"February 22, 2020",4, Decentralized video is great but app is buggy
72,Atomic Apologetics,"December 25, 2019",3," A little clunky and difficult to use without watching a tutorial video. But once you get past all that, it's a fine app. Finally another option besides YouTube."
73,Emmanuel Huchet,"December 20, 2019",3," Newest videos showing up in the app are 12 days old, can't seem to update the app to get the latest vids for my subscriptions, even if I choose the New option. Recent vids show up fine on the lbry.tv web page."
74,Szymonurai,"December 13, 2019",3," I joined I like that my favorite people are joining. However, the app is not that good. Needs some more features. Like the ability to play audio only with the screen off. It's still early hoping it grows."
75,kelvin beels,"January 21, 2020",4," Comparable to YouTube, except sometimes videos have a small delay when waiting to play (but maybe that's a internet signal problem).Getting rewards for viewing content is nice, overall i give it 9/10."
76,Clyde Sheppard,"February 1, 2020",5, Really enjoying the add free App. All the content I need and more. Found some great content providers too
77,Kevin Lang,"December 20, 2019",1, probally would be a great program if it would rotate to landscape. video has always been wide screen. i didn't even try it out that a major oversite i keep on checking tho cause i hate youtube now. so looking for a alternative.
78,Andrew Sunde,"February 3, 2020",5, LBRY is a great platform and the team developing this app and their webapp have make great progress in recent months.
79,Jeffrey Creem,"January 1, 2020",4," Dramatic improved. If you tried lbry years ago or never tried the mobile app, give it a try. It's come a long way. More content, better performance, same freedom."
80,Juell Gibson,"December 25, 2019",3, Seems pretty good until you try to sort by upload date to find newest vids on a subject. Maybe it's just me but I haven't found a way to do it.
81,Stacey Mayer,"November 25, 2019",5," Great alternative to YouTube channels, this is a natural outgrowth of that sort of platform, with perhaps a much larger vision."
82,Tony Bonang,"November 30, 2019",4, The app works pretty good and I love the ability to earn tokens. There is always room for improvement and I know the development team is constantly working on that so there's a bright future for LBRY
83,Misa Marinovik,"February 9, 2020",5, A viable alternative for YouTube in the near future.
84,Flange,"November 28, 2019",5," LBRY is still in it's infancy, as a consequence requires some improvements. That being said, this is/will be THE place to go for unadulterated content. Thank you."
85,From The Wooded Valley The Watchdog Of YHVH,"April 18, 2020",4, Excellent app to Avoid Suppression
86,Erich Tackett,"January 16, 2020",4," It is a great alternative to youtube as they are now censoring. Lbry does not censor, and its p2p so content lasts as long as its viewed.

Lbry does not censor, and its p2p so content lasts as long as its viewed. As far as monetization, they have their own cryptocurrency. You get rewards for watching, uploading content. You also can get tips from viewers and you can set a price to view your content. I give it 4 stars as the app is in need of features and dire need of polish on the user interface or UI. If everyone would upload some content and share the app well boom"
87,Edward Nunez,"January 16, 2020",5, Way better than the other alt tech options. UI is great and looking forward to more improvements.
88,Matthew B,"December 9, 2019",4," Can be slow at times, but I enjoy watching videos without having to worry about excessive ads"
89,Rohan _,"February 4, 2020",4, The only thing missing is the ability to change video resolution to a lower one.
90,Christian Hunt,"January 13, 2020",5, The app is great especially when you have a large micro SD card to keep your videos on.
91,Donny Laws,"January 21, 2020",2, Love the idea. But the app load times are excessive. Perhaps load more in the background after giving us a GUI
92,Richard Peacock,"January 8, 2020",4, The video quality is excellent. Tweaking may be needed for content searches. Overall this is an excellent service.
93,Jimmy G,"January 10, 2020",4, Not bad. Would love to stream LBRY videos to my TV via Google Chromecast. The Chromecast icon doesn't come up. Is there some way I can do this?
94,Jimbo L.,"January 8, 2020",4," Does not work too well on a slow dsl connection, but it does have interesting features."
95,Rob Groove,"January 28, 2020",3, Needs faster loading menu/videos also please add chromecast button and allow queing of casting video.
96,Dennis Menezes,"November 11, 2019",4," Feature requests: comments, reactions, likes, audio only version, low medium high quality. Amazing app!"
97,HOKUM,"November 17, 2019",2, You require an app be downloaded but the app does not rotate. In other words this app is useless unless I'm laying on my side to watch it. Good thing I refused to set up an account.
98,Antonius Bekti,"January 17, 2020",3, Decent beta version. Really needs video transcoding/compression to be watchable on mobile though.
99,Richard Hoak,"December 13, 2019",1," App will not even open. When i click the ""confirm account button in my browser nothing happens beyond a white screen. How do I use this app if it doesnt work?"
100,Nicholas Taylorson,"January 18, 2020",5, I enjoy the potential of the app. There is loads of room for improvement but it does what it's supposed to.
101,Victoria Jenkins,"January 23, 2020",1, Navigating through the app wasn't very easy and signing in was a mild nightmare.
102,Esra Celik,"December 10, 2019",2," The app is really slow , always freezing. I hope it will get better."
103,Jacob Varghese,"January 19, 2020",1," Horrible, lagging does not open the video, you can compete with YouTube with this stuff. Waiting for the email link it does not arrive for login in. Pathetic"
104,:Hagen :Lunau,"November 15, 2019",4, Need to be able to see app in landscape mode. Needs to be a priority otherwise people will just go to YouTube.
105,Leonard Hanstein,"November 11, 2019",4, Still pretty slow to load. Good content for the most part. I'll keep it.
106,Babis G,"December 29, 2019",4, Great app and great idea but appears slow to load videos at times.
107,numan numan,"January 11, 2020",5," Still maturing, but otherwise great and upcoming video platform."
108,S M,"January 29, 2020",4, Sometimes it takes a while to buffer a video
109,Joe Tom Collins,"November 19, 2019",3, Library is a great system but the app still has a way to go.
110,Zombie Bots,"April 9, 2020",5, Better than YouTube by a lot.
111,Eray Erdin,"November 8, 2019",3, The multithreading in this app is a joke. Stays unresponsive when you touch somewhere.
112,Henrique Campos,"December 2, 2019",4," The app still hangs a bit now and then, but still all love and support for this"
113,Can Man,"March 31, 2020",5, I love this platform. Its becoming the best video site now as its decentralized.
114,Tomoghno Sen,"April 1, 2020",4, Best open-source video platform
115,arms leading,"March 5, 2020",5," great app, thank you for all of your time and help!!"

197,TheRealMusdi,"June 27, 2019",1, The idea of this platform is Awesome but the app is way too slow. It takes forever to load anything. I know this is the beta so keep this in mind before an official release.Organize the content thats being uploaded better. And prioritize minimal clicks.
198,Tony Ciantar,"June 27, 2019",4," its a beta, so yes there is a delay. anyone remember YouTube in the early days. it crashed on my Nexus 9, but then so does other stuff crash, think the last android update does not help. look forward to improvements in this service, as I dont want YouTube telling me what I should watch."

They seem to be rows of a creators entire work then the next row is another creators, they seem to be In no order. I prefer YouTubes set up where content is arranged by catorgory not creator. Maybe its that I've not got it set up correctly but with Utube u never had to. Set anything up they had done that for u.. Guess they going to get a lot of comments comparing with Utube. But if u want to go against the top brand u need to...."
200,Mike Thompson,"June 23, 2019",4, Would not function under Android emulation on a Chromebook so I couldn't see how it works. Still gave four stars as I would like to see this platform succeed. I hope that it just needs a little more time to iron out the rough spots.
201,Mike Brown,"September 18, 2019",3, I have an older lg stylo 2 anytime I try to watch any video a little black box pops up at the bottom saying video failed to load please go to the help section is this ever just going to work regardless of the device I've never had a problem with any other video streaming service?????
202,Renault Leaking Again,"June 28, 2019",3," needs a lot of improvement and the balance on the lower right corner is extremely annoying. would be logic to have a menu for your account too. keep it up and it will improve a lot, good luck, hope this is the final nail on YT's coffin"
203,Scott Foust,"June 25, 2019",3, Looks promising. Love the idea. But I need a down load and watch laster feature like YouTube has. My media consumption flow is: Download at home then watch/listen while away. Also really love YouTubes audio only feature (start video playing then turn off screen to listen only).
204,Christopher,"December 13, 2019",5," Great alternative to YT. A big thank you to the developers of LBRY for giving us an excellent alternative to the free speech hating, thought controlling app that is Google/YouTube! Keep up the good work!"
205,Takoda Horton,"January 19, 2020",5," Very nice, great youtube replacement"
206,Mike lynskey,"February 5, 2020",1, Uninstalled it immediately. Why it has to run full time on my phone is beyond me.
207,D. Vegas,"June 19, 2019",5," 5 stars... keep up the good work. I know all the kinks will be worked out....and I hope to see a feature where we upload direct from our phones soon. great things take time, baby steps to success with a solid foundation!!"
208,Konia Williams,"June 20, 2019",3," Constantly shutting itself down. There's no search history option either. Besides the restarting app every 2-3 mins, there could be potential here. We could get many YT channels to move to this app long as the app keeps getting improved."
209,Shady B,"June 21, 2019",4, I am really enjoying this app so far. It's a little bit slow but it's great. I tried to get this in my laptop but my firewall wouldn't accept it and I would really wish if you could add a publish button for mobile devices. Keep up the good work
210,Alkzues,"June 27, 2019",5," Don't complain about an app that clearly says BETA. Yes it's going to have its issues, that's why they released it with the code name BETA to let people know it ain't finished and that they want feedback from the actual people who are using their app"
211,V W,"June 17, 2019",2, Hey there. This app is super slow and never lets me play a video :( hope you can fix it I have ab LG stylo 4 plus. New phone in past 6 months. I wish it would work. I guess streaming with LBRY will have to wait. Uninstalled. Thanks
212,7.83 Hz,"June 18, 2019",5," only giving 5 stars because i hate youtube. the lbry app is slow & unresponsive at times. cant change the video quality 144 saves me data or video speed. No comment section, no soul music on there. get better lbry get better. just copy yt but use a green theme"
213,Pat Kwame,"August 9, 2019",3," Great application with overall inclusive tools ranging from academic,to movie thrillers,and so much more... However,the app keeps hanging on my device and that restrained me from rating it five stars.Still great app though.👍"
214,Travis Foster,"June 24, 2019",1," can't seem to find the channel content I searched for every time I use the app. It's a very frustrating experience. uninstall the app if you can people, I just did."
215,Amine Mekhatria,"June 25, 2019",1," I was excited about the project, so i installed the app a couple of days ago, and i can't even use it because its stuck in ""retrieving account information"" page. I did everything but it just doesn't work."
216,JAJ Johnson,"June 26, 2019",2, Runs in the background all the time..I hate apps that run with out my permission..have to force stop when I'm done..I will keep it installed and let the app develop for awhile..Mostly cause I hate Google and someone needs to 1 up youtube..get to work boys and girls👍
217,Stranga Strigo,"July 5, 2019",5, It's not perfect but a great start. I don't get so frustrated I give up so it's already better than a lot of other apps! I've found done great things already!
218,Patrick TAYLOR,"June 28, 2019",5," The lag is real in this one. However it gets 5 stars for a great concept. I hope that, in the very least, apps like this pressure YouTube to treat content creators better."
219,Sydney Gravesen,"July 5, 2019",3," The overall layout of it is extremely well made, but at the moment none of the videos will load. Hopefully you will be able to fix this. I am looking forward to its full release!"
220,Timothy Phoenix,"June 22, 2019",1," ""Please wait while we get some things ready..."" That's all this app does so far. Can't connect to LBRY servers. Too bad. Always looking for a good YouTube alternative. This is terribly Beta. They need to get the app ready. Uninstalled."
221,Rob Rich,"June 25, 2019",3," not able to watch any videos...i keep getting a failure to download error. I'd press play and that the circle would spin and then the error would appear. other than that, I'm excited for this app"
222,Eddie Vasquez,"June 26, 2019",2, The site is very slow and it's not my internet either since I have the best package with my provider. I suggest they get more servers to handle traffic volume. Until then I sadly can't enjoy this YouTube alternative.😒
223,Thomas Curtis,"June 26, 2019",2," Crashes a lot, virtually unusable... great idea, delivery is lacking, no obvious way to create content? The supposed whole effing point? Anyway, I'll check back in a few months, guess we'll see. Currently a bummer. getguudscrub"
224,Dimitris Hol,"June 20, 2019",2," A reason why you need access to my files would be nice, since it's a pretty invasive permission. I want an alternative for youtube but you have to be clearer with permissions. Will give it another go once you figured that out."
225,Angel Abrams,"June 24, 2019",1, I want to believe but the app crashes after 2 minutes and not enough of the content creators have migrated yet. I will change my rating if these 2 milestones are achieved. Keep at it.
226,Sai Amun,"July 30, 2019",5," love it, hope to have PiP (picture In picture) soon. id use it more often if this feature was available. with that this would be the YouTube killer. thank you for fellowshiping like minds"
227,Peter Larsen,"June 23, 2019",1, I like the idea of a better model from YouTube - but so far I'm finding nothing but issues that prevents me from even trying it out. I'll come back at some point to see if it's regained stability.
228,Vincent Chapman,"June 23, 2019",1," unusable, loads some video thumbnails but is unable to actually play any video. really slow at this point and not really functional. hopefully its production keeps going until it is a viable YouTube alternative."

236,Thomas Zarebczan,"May 30, 2019",5, New update is kicking butt. No more files saved on my device + wallet syncing! More and more new content showing up each week. Still a bit sluggish and slow to startup.

Although the LBRY protocol is open source and available to be used by anybody, like email or matrix, this is the official app made by the guys to create the protocol. Admittedly, one of the biggest issues it as is a lack of content, which the devs can't do much about. However, I've of the issues I have with the app that I hope the devs WILL do something about include a lack of transcoding and a frequent bug that causes videos to continue playing after the app is closed"
