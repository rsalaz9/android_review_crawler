0,Zvi Steinberg,"April 19, 2020",3," Works well enough except it has a tendency to notify you of a article, then when you click takes you to a completely unrelated article or one you've already seen, and there isn't a ""breaking news"" section on the home page to find the new article yourself"

But we can play the video from the bottom. We have a good connection. The site is not also blocked on our router/firewall. Any reason ? I have my OPPO Device, with model CPH1919, Android 8.1, ColorOS ver. 5.2.1"
2,Matthew Stephens,"April 22, 2020",1, Please check app. It crashes on boot up and I am unable to use it. Disappointing when I have a paid subscription.
3,Harsh Shah,"April 22, 2020",1, Worst. I signed up for the student subscription but I couldn't get access to it . What is this?! If you can't give it why are you advertising it?!
4,Akachi Okoro,"April 22, 2020",5, Great app with good functionality but can be sluggish at times.
5,Emily Gray-Fow,"February 25, 2020",4," Great source of news and information, but for a freelance writer the subscription is a bit steep.

Maybe Bloomberg could split the subscriptions in two, with a lower tier accessing news etc plus a limited number of more detailed market data each month, and a higher tier accessing more in depth market data, able to track shares, etc?"
6,Neelish Chainani,"April 20, 2020",5, One of the best apps out there for markets news. wish it had more free articles
7,Rj Nismo,"February 14, 2020",1, The monthly price they are asking doesn't even justify as an annual price. May be if it was one time price of 30dollars perhaps worth considering. Their content isn't that special or exclusive justifying this ridiculous price. you can find similar stories and features in many other free app.
8,Kola Fabiyi,"March 25, 2020",5," This is the best app I have used in a long time for my investment assessment. It is very stable, has clean interface (easy to navigate), up to date in all required information and very responsive in all functionalities. Great app."

11,Deleted Smith,"February 28, 2020",1, Absolutely way too many links to pay walls. Regardless of how the developer tries to justify it there's so many Dang ads in here there's no reason for pay walls. I will be deleting it off my phone shortly.

74,Alan Sonnenberg,"March 23, 2020",2, News is good but 5 article limit per month means it's not worth installing this app unless you subscribe - for hundreds of dollars per year!

76,Al Darn,"November 11, 2019",4," Way to go Bloomberg!! Two problems fixed, so it's from 1 Star to 4. Let me rotate the screen to use a wider page and I'll make it 5 Starts. It's just a matter of not restricting the page to a vertical-only orientation. Easy peezy."
77,Patrick OBrian,"February 3, 2020",2," I like the content, but it's too expensive per month. Four articles and then cut off just doesn't justify having an app."
78,Alex Z,"January 15, 2020",2," Having used Bloomberg since the blackberry era I have 2 issues with this: 1) no dark mode 2) Even with a 40 dollar per month subscription, content is cluttered full of ads. Paid subscription at this pricepoint should be ad-free. With this many ads I would value it at 4.99-7.99 a month, NOT 34.99"
79,Echo Honeybee,"January 27, 2020",2, Everything made by Bloomberg can't seem to work properly & aside from this app their TV network sucks too.

I used to think Comcast sucked & couldn't hardly ever get Bloomberg Channel to work. DirectTV...didn't work on there either. Dish Net? Not really. Hundreds & hundreds of channels to pick from on all 3 providers & Bloomberg is the only channel that crashes so it makes sense that both Andrd & Apl versions of the Bloomberg app crash. I find it comical that you want us to pay for a sub.üñï

86,Chung Chung,"December 30, 2019",1, Great app. Up to date news. Problem is the incredibly high subscription plans. They should look at plans fitting towards regional market instead of the global American costs. It's too high in Asian markets.
87,Chris Battle,"January 4, 2020",4," Great content, only bug is the failure to save articles to read later that is only overcome by uninstalling then reinstalling the app. News & business content better than any except FT."

89,Calvin Lau,"January 10, 2020",3," Can the app developer please fix the font problem? I am running Android 10 on a Pixel 4 and it is stuck on the smallest font. Everytime I switch to another app and return to Bloomberg it will go back to the smallest font, which is annoying."

Very responsive and updates the news regularly. HOWEVER, while not especially detrimental, the articles consistently cut off content at the end of a paragraph. For example, ""Democrats, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the"" and the sentence ends.

VERY disappointing coming from Bloomberg!! Takes forever to sign in, always quoting a network error, regardless of the connection I am on. No other app has the issue but this one ALWAYS does. After entering the password the screen loads ad perpetuum and, if it doesn't take at least 4 or 5 attempts to log on, it stays stuck until force stopped. Fails on my Galaxy S9+, my S3 tablet and, the cherry on the cake: logs on successfully on my Windows PC ...but fails to sync the watchlist as it appears on my mobile! So earlier changes I managed to (eventually) make on my mobile don't even appear when I log on from my desktop. Talk about messed up, talk about unreliable!! Once logged in any attempt to edit the saved watchlist (which took countless attempts to save in the first place!) the network error message appears again without fail, only to lose all changes when reloaded ...and so it continues. Only worth looking at but NOT worth actually USING. Does not even remotely come close to Bloomberg's reliability based on their terminals. A very cheap and useless marketing gimmick which DEFINITELY does not convince to actually sign up for the paid service. 35$/month for this garbage app is 35$ too much! There's much better stuff out there to track markets, get need and even your portfolio. Even paid services that are better value. As for Bloomberg articles, just read what is free and track your holdings elsewhere. Don't be fooled by the name..."

Having fewer functions than before will cost you stars. 2. The App crashes more often than before, especially when I open a Markets page from a News page, maybe related to switching to a different WiFi or turning on/off WiFi in-between. 3.

Please fix asap. I can't continue paying for this if it doesn't work the way it should! See previous review below. ----------------------------------------------------------------- As I've stated in the past, I'm still experiencing performance issues when trying to stream live TV content. The app keeps crashing when I have the live stream play in the background (audio only). I am using a Samsung Note 9 but tried other Android devices and still experience the same problem. I wish there was a patch to address this issue once and for all. It's not fair to charge the amount of $35 a month for the content if you can't consume it!

1954,Jay Tyagi,"September 1, 2018",2," Content is gold, app is too buggy, lacking many important features like built-in dictionary and Medium-like visual quote sharing.

2409,Din Kiat Poh,"February 9, 2018",1, It takes so long to search for stock quotes and when switching between different sections that i usually give up and exit the app. Not sure what are the enhancements and upgrades except a different UI.
2410,A Google user,"March 2, 2018",5," This version can adjust font size in contents. That is very good for me. One thing this app could improved is speed when access watchlist menu because it's slow, Thank you."

Why do they update the app on a near daily basis? For the past month or two, I turn off notifications, yet they still keep popping up. Every time I go to turn notifications off, they're turned on when I last had them turned off. Is it the Michael Bloomberg propaganda machine filling the void of Facebook ""being less news?"" What a poor experience. Combine that with their ten year decline from objective market news into CNBC style editorialized newsertainment, I'm probably only going to turn those notifications off so many more times before I decide I don't really need this app."

But the problem is, it is one of the worst news app (just in terms of app sense). Other than not so great user interface, like many of the people pointed out, one has to login everytime he/she comes back to use the app. Also, if you click on the notification you receive, you would still get stuck on the old news article that was already open in the app and the news story for which you came for (through notification), just disappears into the ocean of other news stories. There are also a lot of other bugs that need to be fixed and I don't know why, but with each update I feel this app is moving backward instead of forward, hope you guys turn this around soon !"

2575,Johnny Flare,"January 17, 2018",2, Would usually give this app 5 stars. Unfortunately they have now started playing 30 second TV ads when live TV and videos start. The main reason I watch Bloomberg is up to now being free of ads. Downward move if you ask me. Back to radio if it gets any worse.
2576,A Google user,"December 11, 2017",1, The auto play ads are eating my mobile data... You need the advertising revenue but not at end user expense... will remove the app once i find a replacement... like the news hate the auto play ads.

It is always a pleasure to read and listen to their diverse reporting and opinions.  Mr. Mayor,  Two things:   Please fix the radio part of the app so I don't have to have my phone unlocked and keep the bloomberg app on top! I can't listen with my phone in my pocket because of that, and additionally don't you guys think that I should be able to listen to your news while also doing such things as banking or trading on my device as well? As of now it's impossible and that's a shame.   Second thing; now that there is an empty slot from the absence of Charlie Rose, please fill it with John Batchelor! I think your listeners would appreciate him very much, and I think his principles would align with your listener base very well.   Cheers"

Apparently there's code that can hijack tour screen and is susceptible to malware. I've had to uninstall it because we've already seen businesses have websites hijacked, so releasing an app with a code error was very irresponsible of Bloomberg.  Update: after notifying them, they fixed the app. But they never responded to my email. Good app, crappy customer service.

I turn on my phone and see a notification.  Whoa that looks like a really interesting news story  I think, so I click on it. Screen opens onto news story but I can't read it because there is a big pop up notification telling me to update the app. No option there except for updating.  This is annoying I think, when this eventually opens I will have to go searching for this story again; but no, what I eventually get is a screen with a large B on it that does nothing whatsoever. Five minutes of wasted time to try and read a story that was actually on my screen behind a notification five minutes ago. Any programmer who thought that was a good idea is a programmer makes poor programming decisions; I am not going to keep an app installed that deliberately annoys me and thinks that it controls me and my phone rather than I do. I have a news app to read the news, not to enter a power struggle with a piece of software that wants to commit suicide."

2968,Henry Hartono,"June 23, 2017",1, The latest update to the watchlist renders it useless. Too many useless information are displayed. Too much space is allocated to the symbol. Watchlist is very hard to use when using a phone. User should be able adjust the column size for the symbol and configure the columns to be displayed.
2969,Sarah A,"June 23, 2017",1, Pointless trying to monitor watchlist performance if there's an ad blocking half the screen. If you need to have an ad put it on a scroll bar down the bottom so it doesn't get in the way of content. This 'upgrade' renders the app virtually useless to me.

It is a shock that Bloomberg could not create a working app that doesn't crash every 60 seconds.  Business Insider works as a stable platform, and I will be using their services instead."
3067,A Google user,"May 21, 2017",1," It crashes constantly.  It's unbelievable.  I assumed it was my phone for a long time, but I just spoke with a few friends who had the exact same problem.  Uncharacteristic of Bloomberg and not ok."
3068,Roman Kozak,"May 23, 2017",2, I love Bloomberg but on the Galaxy S8+ their app needs significant updates. It frequently crashes and doesn't take up the entire view of the screen. Happy to change this to *5 STAR* after an update.
3069,Christian Blunden,"May 23, 2017",2, Since last few updates app is very unstable and constantly crashes. Can't read more than the headline of an article before it crashes. I am at point of uninstalling
3070,Richard Pringle,"May 27, 2017",1, Would be a great app if it worked. It crashes all the time though. I noticed that if I keep my finger on the screen (slowly scrolling through an article) it'll crash. They just need a stable build.
3071,Bigie Mouse,"May 24, 2017",1, I love this app but it KEEPS CRASHING. I have unistalled and re installed it 5 times. It really has alot of potential and it gives alot of good information. You can see the effort that has gone into the design. It simply needs to be functional and stop crashing.
3072,William Johnson,"May 19, 2017",3," Love this app, the only reason I rate it a 3 star is because I have never had an application crash more times. In short it is very useful when it works but utterly frustrating when it crash in the middle of reading an article."
3073,udo schuklenk,"May 24, 2017",1," Mind boggling that you are unable to develop an app that doesn't crash all the time, after all those months of knowing about the problem. You reinstalled the thing, crashes even more frequently."
3074,Tugela60,"May 24, 2017",1," The app would be good, if it worked. Unfortunately it crashes about once a minute (on a Galaxy s8), so it is basicly unusable."
3075,A Google user,"May 19, 2017",1, Latest version still has constant random crashes but also reduced text sizes to unusable levels. Would still be using old version but they disabled it. Forced to look for a replacement for market info and news.
3076,Kody Jardim,"May 22, 2017",1," Crashes all the time, rendering it unusable. Judging from the comments, they've made zero effort to resolve it."

3078,William Hart,"May 23, 2017",1, Redesign of this app is tragic.  UI elements are cut off by bounding boxes. Scrolling is jagged and choppy when title bar appears.  Design and usability are tarnishing the brand.
3079,Alic Camille,"June 15, 2017",1, No other app on my phone crashes that much. Actually it's the only app that crashes. Doesn't work on Samsung S7 edge.

Every time a push message with article is opened it crashes. Each successive attempt to reopen/navigate to same article results in app crashing 30 seconds later. This happens with seemingly EVERY article, just with longer delay between crashes.   Considering this is Bloomberg we're talking about here, I am very disappointed.   Why release an app (or keep an app on the market) that doesn't work well on either the latest Iphone or the latest Android device; it's brand tarnishing."
3086,Jimmy Merritello,"May 23, 2017",2, The app would be great but as others have mentioned it crashes constantly for no apparent reason. I have sent feedback multiple times and no adjustment has been made. Bloomberg is technical enough to get this right. Get on it please.

The revamp looks terrible, most important of all it crashes all the time.

It crashes regularly - either while using the app or randomly in the background. The app feels more heavyweight - the older version was much quicker to launch.

It's always been a great companion for quotes, great news and opinions, really comprehensive and smooth to use. For some strange reason a good thing had been totally messed up.

Way less functional, much more difficult to peruse various topics, always flushed with the same few headlines. And it crashes all the dam time.

I use the Bloomberg app for market news and very much preferred the layout from before -- sections were compact, distinct, and easy to navigate. It also crashes constantly now. Additionally, notifications are hit-and-miss, unfortunately; sometimes, they will direct me to the article, but most of the times they simply open up the app."
3383,Wael Salah,"March 7, 2017",1," Previous version was much better in how it's organized. This one looks horrible. Also, each time I open the app, it asks me to get it updated (which I did but for some reason the app doesn't recognize it and keep asking). It's a mess, how can this new version gets released with all these issues."
3384,James Egan,"February 8, 2017",1, The new app is for only a phine screen layout so is totally now a terrible experience. It wont let uou run the old app which worked extremely well on a tablet. Why fix sometning that isnt broken. Bad marketing
3385,A Google user,"February 15, 2017",1, I would have given 5 star rating for the app till they updated it. Its almost useless now. Previous version was so good with all the required info like costs etc shown clearly. I wish I can have the old version back even if I need to pay for it

3769,John Grubbs,"January 30, 2017",1," This upgrade is so bad that I will probably stop using Bloomberg on tablet and phone.  The previous app was fine. It was easy to navigate and the video access was good.  I kept declining the upgrade after trying it, but now there is no option to keep and use the prior app.  This is horrible!"
3770,Philip Kim,"December 23, 2016",1,Wow this keeps getting worse I loved the app two revisions ago. Lost my portfolio with the last revision and now this one crashes on my first try. How can I convey utter disappointment and disgust. Anybody have any reliable options please share here. So bloomberg can just go away
3771,Jonathan Chung,"January 31, 2017",1," Horrible update over the old version where now the app has dumbed down information available or at least much harder to access.  I really miss the old version's home screen where you get an overview of news, market and other info on 1 page."
3772,SC C,"January 8, 2017",1,"Format chg is bad Prefer previous version, easier to browse what we want to read. Now clunky, & unfriendly for the eyes with white background which may also consume more battery power. Pls chg back to old format. Tq"

In the previous version, push notifications would alert me to breaking news and I could easily see the whole headline with a simple swipe without opening the full app. In the latest version, push notifications only show a partial headline and I have to open the full app just to finish reading the headline. Unfortunately, this is more annoying than it is helpful and I find myself using the app less and less because of it. If this simple issue were fixed, I would give the app 5 stars."
3774,Aaaa A,"January 1, 2017",1,"The new UI is horrible, please let people to downgrade I don't think they used any testers or had a test group for that matter, the usefulness just went almost to 0%.

3775,Vlad Glavtchev,"December 22, 2016",2,"Crashes A LOT after most recent update This app was really stable for me on my OnePlus3 and Google Pixel, but since the big UI redesign, it crashes every few minutes. It's really annoying to lose my reading place and have to start over."
3776,Tao Han,"January 4, 2017",1,Worest ever update I am amazed how terrible a team of professionals can do to update a very goid app. The old version was easy to use and had a link to Chromecast. The updated version is rubbish! Now I have to watch Bloomberg on PC.
3777,Jim Russell,"January 13, 2017",1,DANGER.... DO NOT DOWNLOAD If it ain't broke don't fix it. Less user friendly for market data than before and less configurable. Can we have the old version back or do we have to wait for a new product manager to piss on the tree to make a mark.
3778,Peter Campbell,"December 21, 2016",2," Loved all the previous versions, still hate this one, but not much as my initial reaction after two updates. Content seems better than it was initially.

3779,Matthew Brown,"January 2, 2017",2,"What happened? It's as if someone decided to just gut the old version and make this as laggy as the Bloomberg news website is (and I watch Bloomberg TV every trading day). It needs the clear yet detailed navy system back, and the dark theme returned."
3780,Mark Wilson,"January 17, 2017",1,What a downgrade The new version is so much less useful and clumsier to navigate. Bloomberg has rich content which is now almost impossible to find other than the tailored pap that the main feed gives you. Terrible

Brutal update.  CNBC I'm coming back. I would be happy to pay for this app (but only the previous version ), why not just charge us for a good ad-free quality version so we get live TV, high quality content, and a top notch UI) instead of this flashy tabloid version EDIT: I haven't used this app in months, because of how bad it is. I see they haven't brought back the BLACK interface. When you do, I'll try again."
3883,Christian Florensa,"January 30, 2017",1, This app sucks compared to the old one. In my tablet it leaves a huge   amount of white space empty. What bothers me most is that they force you to use the new version of the app.

It looks like the focus was presenting articles while the technical and quote section was just an afterthought. Poor use of real estate. Ads, I expect for a free app, but not ones twice the size of the graphs and data on a page. No obvious way to edit lots once you add them. I would say the only reason it's on my phone now is for breaking news, but even the notifications are partially obscured instead of the entire headline. Trying Seeking Alpha/Stock Watcher/StockTracker instead. Such a shame."

Obviou...Full Review""Make Bloomberg Great Again"" -- Donald Trump (not!). Okay that's what he would say if he was foolish enough to do the upgrade! Like the Repugnant Party, Bloomberg has chosen to self-destruct. Bad is the only word (short of a barrage of 4-letter explicatives) to describe this piece of garbage! Obviously, some dipstick MBA was hoping for a Christmas bonus for hyping a downgrade! Let's hope Bloomberg fires his sorry *ss!! (Merry Christmas,  twit - take the rest of the dim witted team with ya!) Terminate with extreme prejudice (please)!!! Of course, it's Wall Street so there's no accountability and the Bloomdud directors won't know or care! Yuck says it all! Uninstall this BCA (Bloomberg crap app) and go to a company that wants (cares, deserves) your patronage! Some Bloombird laid a rotten, smelly Xmas egg! PU! See a doctor! Argg.. What was blooming Bloomberg thinking? Oh, sorry I missed the point, you weren't thinking! They actually pay (overpay, by a lot  judging by the results) someone to flop, like a dead Bloombird falling to earth! Listen carefully, it's called Bloomsquawk (the dim-witted sound of a dying Bloombird)! Blessed be the sleepy for they shall soon nod off!! However, on the positive side, I am am extremely grateful to the Bloomduds for doing such a bad job and giving me this wonderful opportunity to provide the sad, clueless dimwits with some Bloomsquawk! Will they listen? Of course not! They'll get a big bonus for making their goals without regard for the final result! Bravo!"

Why do I have to get kicked out of an article I'm reading the second Bloomberg adds new content to the site? I keep updating this app hoping the problems get resolved but they never do. Today I tried to watch a video but after sitting through yet another annoying 15 second ad, I got kicked out. 15 seconds of nonsense and no content. Great job BLOOMBERG!  Today, the app says ""no news stories available"". Maybe Bloomberg is out of business?!?"

When you build an Android application it has its own storage it can use and does not require explicit access to the entire device storage. You app tells the user that it needs full storage access ""so the Bloomberg app can work with its configuration files."" Which is a blatant LIE!

I would appreciate if in the watchlist menu only show 3 options  which are SYMBOL, LAST, and CHANGE only. The main reason is because with only 3 options we can see the full price of the entity if the entity has 4 or 5 digits.

The latest version is no better, in fact, feels worse if that is possible. Maybe it is time to start boycotting their advrrtisers who may have more clout in getting Bloomberg  to fix app correctly. On the positive side, if you can get the app running long enough, content is informative and well presented. Please no more automated responses."
7158,Hong Foo Shen,"March 15, 2016",3,"App freezes constantly. The content is absolutely amazing for daily readers. However, my Samsung Galaxy J7 has been facing the issue that if I stopped scrolling while reading for around 10s, the app will freeze. Hope this to be fixed and it will be my top choice app."
7159,Nathan Aaron Heller,"March 14, 2016",2,"Updated App Still Crashes! I love this app, but the recent and prior updated builds continue to suffer from incessant crashes - particularly with videos. So it's very hard to enjoy in all its aspects currently, and I very much hope a permanent fix is in the works really soon."

7164,Jesse Fink,"March 17, 2016",2,Crashes If it didn't crash every 2 seconds it might be good. I just can't see it long enough to tell. This is after updating for their latest fix

Overall the contents is nicely presently and published."

It would be interesting to have easy access to how well a company or corporation managed (or didn't manage) the last boom and bust. Other than that it is a great app that hel you organize your watch list and keep track of how your shares are doing. Not mention many helpful news articles. Definitely recommend the app

I would like to see an option to view charts for currencies and commodities.  Also, the live streaming TV option doesn't work for me. It keeps buffering and buffering forever, never showing any picture, or sound for that matter. Yet, I can view the videos/clips with ease, in high quality."
7277,Nicholas Steen,"February 11, 2016",5,"Excellent news source And works seamlessly with Google chromecast. My favorite thing is watching live television because the picture quality is great and there are very few interruptions. News stories are great, love that the reader has a black background. Just overall an excellent app and highly recommended."
7278,chukwuma okafor,"March 5, 2016",4,Great App This app has all I need as long business news is concerned... The only challenge is that it's slow in  loading. If you can make it faster each time I want to load a page.
7279,Hany,"March 2, 2016",4,Top. Website for global markets news Please the app. Still needs to fix the freezing proplems. I am using the latest mobile Samsung S6 edge plus and the proplems need extra updating. Thanks
7280,Alec Houston,"February 17, 2016",1,"Playback is terrible The app is good but I just want to watch the live stream and its terrible. It keeps chopping back and forth, at best its unintelligible at worst its disorientating and makes me feel ill. Please fix and I will alter my review."
7281,Bernard Wong,"February 23, 2016",5,Great but one big issue Like this app a lot. Only one nagging problem. I like to share many of the articles. If you select a default share you cannot remove it and can only share to one place after that. Eg Twitter and then Face book is inaccessible for sharing.
7282,Robert Ioiart,"February 24, 2016",3,"Obtrusive ads Content is ok but the the ads really impact usability, suddenly appearing under your finger as you are about to scroll, opening a browser. The app is also prone to freezing when switching between apps, which makes the pesky ads even more annoying."
7283,Eric Chow,"February 8, 2016",1,"App still crashed I'm on Samsung note 5. App opens fine. Run a video. Then a phone call comes in. After that. App crashed. Even after forced close, it doesn't work anymore until restart."
7284,Bobby Burns,"February 25, 2016",1,Very Unstable This is app force closes whenever I switch to a different app or lock my phone. It is the most unstable app I've ever used
7285,Augustus Toadvine,"February 16, 2016",3,Once worked great Latest update of Feb 5 has ruined it on my phone.  Sometimes will not load.  Regularly takes forever to activate.  I used it often.  Unusable now.

7296,Esiri Obahor,"February 10, 2016",5,Great App It is very useful. One thing I would suggest is to make users be able to use offline through downloading articles
7297,Tony Gallagher,"February 15, 2016",4,Bloomberg app Comprehensive source of market information and news from around the world. Easy to navigate.  Slight technical problem in that it crashes on my android device from time to time.
