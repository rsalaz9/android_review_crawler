Our air quality is between 150-190 depending on which part of town your are in. Even our news is reporting it in the 150's at least. It is only pulling data from one station, probably the state run one that isn't maintained properly. We pull our data from Purple Air's website/sensors locally. I love the concept. People here do not take this seriously, and this would be a good tool to drive the point home."
1,akanksha dwivedi,"November 11, 2019",2, There is something wrong with this app. Me and my sister checked AQI on different phone's but same location and results shown different.How it is possible ?. I think they should focus on this problem and remove asap.
2,Zach Anderson,"November 14, 2019",4, Interesting information and everything but why does it cut all of my audio volume in half while it's open?
3,UTKARSH SHARMA,"November 15, 2019",5, Works good with GPS But can't locate other locations on the search.
4,Mark William Despi,"December 11, 2019",5, Air quality is presented in an easy to understand way.

I have a suggestion though. To get more accurate daily, weekly and monthly numbers, just keep the aggregating for the pollution level data on the device for the current location (and any saved location in case user is interested in that) and use it to calculate the values."

It will help to raise public awareness about pollution. 5 stars for the effort and ingenuity. Interface needs improvement. There should be an option to manually enter the AQI (like AQI measured by a portable device or purifier). The app should also show trends over weeks/months. Currently it just multiplies the todays value by number of days for weekly/monthly calculation.
7,Stefan Vuƒçkoviƒá,"January 22, 2020",3," Very nice idea, but app gets ""confused"" with GPS and at the end I couldn't get location at all, had to manually enter place. Despite GPS (high accuracy) enabled."
8,Paul Hastings,"December 9, 2019",4, Would be nice if there was an option for metric system.
9,Tudor Cohea,"September 18, 2018",4, It is an interesting concept which provides useful information regarding the toxicity in our neighbourhoods. Funny smart and inteligent but only to some point. Then it starts to be tidious and boring
10,Bryan Walsh,"November 18, 2018",2," Splash screen has a loop on the latest update. Clearing app data doesn't fix it, currently unusable."
11,A Google user,"November 18, 2018",2," The app is totally broken with the recent update. Module AppRegistry is not a registered callable module, after a splash screen bootloop."
12,Luke Bob,"February 28, 2020",1, App keeps crashing
13,Tushar Jain,"June 27, 2019",5, what a brilliant app. looks cool and works well. I have even cloned it from GitHub üòÄ
14,Îç∞Î¶≠ÌîºÏΩîÎÑà,"January 12, 2019",1," First of all, what a dumb name. This could be educational for kids, but you name it a swear word. Second, it worked once yesterday, but just stuck LOADING today."
15,Qifa,"September 18, 2019",5, i was really drawn to the app but why can't i download it? i have lots of spaces left on my storage but for some reasons the app can't be installed :(
16,AnonLegionary Liberator,"April 22, 2019",5," Great app! Thanks, Amaury Martiny! Keep up the good work!"
17,Lex√≠e Ekater√≠na Sc√•nl√∏n,"November 12, 2018",2, Performance: annoying af
18,Matthew Bird,"November 8, 2018",5, Greet idea well implemented.
19,Carla Mundt,"July 28, 2019",1, message; cannot download....
20,Digital sewa Hindi,"October 30, 2018",1, Very bad fake application
21,Nick Jens,"December 8, 2018",2, Good idea but the app is broken
22,Jeff Smith,"May 20, 2019",5," Simple to use and based on health effects equivalency. Read the Mullers' study and understand. Otherwise, write to me I will explain."
23,Julian Lee,"February 22, 2019",3," No meaurent of time, is the risk breathing 1 hour or 1 day of the air, is it instant calculated risk?"
24,Anoop Chandran,"November 6, 2019",1, This stupid app shows periyar wild life santuary is more polluted than delhi
25,Luke Schoen,"January 6, 2019",5, Sweet. Smoking 0.4 cigarettes/day from tax-payer funded pollution is free and fights cancer
26,Jeet Jain,"November 3, 2019",4, What's with the size of the app?
27,Petra,"May 17, 2019",5, interesting to see the city air pollution
28,Benjamin Sherman,"November 27, 2018",1, Just displays a frozen cigarette turd.
29,Mayank Gupta,"November 10, 2019",5, Beautiful design!
30,Maarten Belmans,"December 4, 2019",5, Top stuff :)
31,Rishi Singhal,"November 10, 2019",5, Works! Scary
32,Manul Madara,"October 24, 2019",5, Amazing idea .
33,Suman Maji,"December 5, 2018",2, Need improvement
34,Sanathoiba Soram,"November 27, 2018",5, Works great
35,Nancy Buono,"August 30, 2018",4, What a great idea! Both funny and educational. Maybe it will make some parents think twice before sending their kids out without masks. (I wish it showed the cumulative amount of cigarettes for an entire 24 hrs rather than just current conditions.)
36,Michael Bowers,"August 21, 2018",5," Great app to put air pollution into much easier to understand terms. Well done!

Well done! I just wish the explanation of the math behind it clarified that (according to the source article) the cigarette comparison is compared to an average person's daily exposure to air pollution, not compared to being outside all day. This makes the statistic even more alarming. Many articles are referencing this app due to wildfires, and they're getting this wrong."
37,Kitab Shah,"August 15, 2018",2," 600km to nearest pollution measuring station. Nice idea, probably better in 
urban centres"
38,A Google user,"August 16, 2018",1," The apps data is wrong it seems. I searched Delhi in the app and it said 
2.6 cigarettes per day, however according to the WHO air quality DB it's 
over 6 cigarettes per day"
39,A Google user,"August 15, 2018",1," The app was completely incorrect, I live in a area not near any major 
cities or factories so pollution would be low and had 2.5 for cigarettes a 
day but when I search Sydney a place of high pollution it said 1 cigarette

sh**t app. Don't get it."
40,The Beatles Reversed,"August 16, 2018",5," Oh Sh**t! I'm scared now. Important app though, keep up the good work."
41,Guillaume Labranche,"August 24, 2018",2," half of the features are broken (cannot load a different city, doesn't know the distance to the closest air quality station)"
42,Katie Simshauser,"August 20, 2018",3," App information was ok, but don't need the profanity hitting me in the face 
when I open it, even using an asterisk."
43,Vikram madan,"August 14, 2018",1," The air quality station database in this app is incomplete and hence the 
reading being displayed is of some distant station"
44,Kyle S,"August 23, 2018",1, App says 0.5 cigarettes or 11pm2.5 from weather station 1km away when actual it is 173pm2.5.... from smoke. Give me a break.
45,Maggie Anne,"August 15, 2018",2," ""Distance to air quality station: 353km."" Not super relevant, but thanks 
anyway."
46,Carrie,"August 25, 2018",1," Stupid app. Atmospheric particulate matter does not equal cigarettes, so to say any amount of pollution equals an amount of cigarettes us false..."
47,A Google user,"August 25, 2018",2, App can't search for or load other cities. Is this thing even under active development??
48,Christi Jackson,"August 20, 2018",1," Urban and industrial areas rated cleaner than rural areas with 1% of the 
population. (2.9m vs 25k)."
49,Jacob Ward,"August 16, 2018",5," Works great, good information to know about air quality."

health! Love that I can easily share today's ratings with one tap. Sure 
there aren't a lot of extra whiz-bang features, but the app is still in the 
beginning stages & I'm sure the developers have more things planned. Right 
now it does exactly what it says on the tin & honestly, that's all I want. 
Big props to the team who created this app & shared with the world!"
51,James Phieffer,"July 21, 2018",3," Dishonest, at times. It shows air quality ratings at times based on 
monitoring stations nowhere near there. For example, when I searched for 
Plevna, a tiny village in eastern Ontario's cottage country, it gave a 
number based on monitoring 90 km away, which could be in downtown Kingston.

monitoring stations nowhere near there. For example, when I searched for 
Plevna, a tiny village in eastern Ontario's cottage country, it gave a 
number based on monitoring 90 km away, which could be in downtown Kingston. 
It shows multiple sites in Toronto, but all have the same rating - I have a 
hard time believing that the air quality at the bus terminal is the same as 
that on Toronto Island, in Lake Ontario. If there's no data for an area, be 
upfront about it. Show where the air quality information is coming from. 
That would make this app far more useful."
52,Maxime Balzeau,"May 6, 2018",4," Nice service but why isn't it just a website? The last thing I need on my 
phone is yet another single use app. This isn't 2008. Apps aren't cool."
53,Gary Davies,"July 18, 2018",4," A great way to put air pollution into context. Very fast finding local air

nearest monitor. A simple, well thought out app üòÄ"

cities perform. Good change."

also which will make it a complete app"

you can compare stats with other world locations. Is Iowa more polluted

observe more than just your own zip code would be immeasurably helpful in 
answering questions like this."
66,Marius T.,"April 29, 2018",2," Great potential but only two stars cause I can't seem to see how much I 
would smoke in another city, which is too bad. Only seeing the city is 
unfortunate, I hope a future update will fix this issue. Great design in 
any case!"
67,Paradigm Shift,"April 26, 2018",2," This app seems like it has good potential. Too bad it won't load anything. 
I keep getting 'escape errors' or something. I live in Norfolk, VA."
68,Christopher Carter,"April 30, 2018",2," For some reason this app needs permission to draw over other apps!!! Why??? 
Furthermore, with high accuracy GPS it got my location wrong, and I can't 
search another. Nice concept but not well executed."
