Possibilities with pinterest are unlimited. Please I've been waiting patiently for the video pinning option to be available in Nigeria. I'll like to share videos and not just pictures on pinterest but I was told it's not yet available to some countries, mine inclusive. I'll be so happy and grateful if it gets to us sooner. Thanks for your work so far."

It's good for finding ideas and browsing memes. But I really wish that you were able to put short videos in the tried section as well as pictures. It would help people explain how they did the craft differently and it would let people use gifs as reaction pictures. Also one tiny problem is that sometimes it glitches, and music and sounds from different pins start playing and you can't hear the pin you are watching, but the only way of stopping it is closing the app."

A few minor issues: the search button not being available occasionally, or videos not loading properly after a few minutes of scrolling through the feed. The major issue I have is when I open a pin that is not meant to have sound, occasionally audio from a different pin starts playing. This has been an issue for months and I'm surprised it hasn't been fixed."

I have found so many creative ways to make so many things with recycled materials, which is so very important!!! I say kudos to Pinterest, and also to all the people that share they're fantastic, creative, and innovative ideas👍❣"

87,Kim Willis,"April 22, 2020",4, I love Pinterest but there is one thing that is quite annoying. When I open the app. there is a group of pictures presented but it then changes quickly to a completely different lot of pictures. It's really annoying because there are things I want to look at but they disappear.

134,LPHstudios Newstand,"April 17, 2020",5, Amazing! I am absolutely in love with this app. It has great new update and personalization is key. The programmmers even listened to the basis on what we want to see or talk about. Minimal ads as I see on my Pinterest account. Overall good job 👌
135,Lxen_ minsuga,"April 17, 2020",3," I really love this app. I use it more than Google when searching for pictures. It's good for downloading pictures and adding ones.

142,Alvin,"April 5, 2020",3," I use this app all the time. I enjoy almost all of it but there are some serious issues with the audio. Pins playing over eachother well after I've moved on. Annoys the hell out of me. Without that I'd give 5 stars, 7 if I could."
143,Aiko Shizuka,"April 13, 2020",4," It's great but I'm having some issues with split screen. When I put in on split screen, I expected the pins to be shrunk down as well but it only cuts then in half which does not allow me to see the whole pin. Kind of a bummer since it's very important for me to be able to work with split screens."

146,Merle Hassall,"April 19, 2020",5, Really helpful app. Search for ideas on what your making or where you are going. Create a board. Pin them on it. Then you can look at your different boards with all your favourite photos on and can click on them to go to the post. Recipes too.
147,Honesty James,"April 16, 2020",5," I've had a pinterest account for 4 years now, and I am absolutely in love! Pinterest is a great way to organize your thoughts and goals. There are no pop up ads or hidden fees. I 1000% recommended downloading this to anyone who is interested."

152,John Wesley Gibson,"April 14, 2020",4, I enjoy using the app and use it every day for my story characters development and general pleasure. When you choose a pin it automatically finds others similar but also a lot of pins that are undesirable. So be careful what pins you choose as it could ruin your pages.
153,Oxana Khomiak,"April 12, 2020",3," It's a very nice app. But it has big issue! When opening some pins, unrelated audio start playing.

156,Amy Day,"April 17, 2020",5," Definitely my favourite app on my phone. Easy to use, the great easy to use layout makes it so much more aesthetically pleasing than other social media apps. I find that the app helps me feel inspired, especially when I'm feeling unmotivated."
157,Debbie Ward,"April 22, 2020",2," Used to be able to save recipe, then recipe was right below picture.

206,Bianca Mercado,"April 23, 2020",2," I'm not sure what happened over the last several days but for some reason when they updated it, it made it really hard to navigate to my profile. All its showing is the home board and the most recently topics I've pinned."
207,Christine Gregory,"April 16, 2020",4, I love Pinterest but lately I find a lot more ads. Apparently people who are sharing things like recipes are making money by including ads. There are pop-ups and all kinds of ads that make it hard to find the actual content.
208,Lavander Ari,"April 24, 2020",5, I could say that this app is the most perfect app in the whole wide world and it is even better than Google!! I keep all day and night on it but the hide options may get improved instead of writing others but that doesn't bother.😊
209,Kristashea Sloan,"April 15, 2020",3," Edit: when I open a pin to read or view, the screen will suddenly stop scrolling and I cannot see all of the content. I wish I could choose language preference or the very least auto translate. I'm sick of seeing pins that I cannot read or recognize as offensive to my personal beliefs."
210,notcereal,"April 14, 2020",5, I love this app and usually it runs great. I went to open it just now and it wouldn't load my feed and kept saying something went wrong. I went to my account page and it said this user doesn't exist. I don't know what's going on with the app but it'd be great if it could get fixed! Thanks!
211,kimbi wood,"April 4, 2020",1," way too many pop up ads! I cant even read the things I want to see. I've had as many as 3 pop up ads going at once, and I cant even click out of them. Plus the majority of the links lead to spammy junk."

214,Nothing Bored,"April 22, 2020",5," If you need app for beautiful photos, interesting ideas or just want to see some beauty shots - this is the best app ever. Pinterest is really good. You can save photos by clicking ""pin it"" and then app suggest you similar posts. 10 out of 10😄"
215,Teffanie Ryle,"March 30, 2020",5, I love 💖 this app. There's always a quote that pertains to what I'm feeling or going through at that moment that helps me emotionally and mentally. I love 💖 sharing these quotes to others. Thank you 😊 Pinterest for being a pick me up.
216,Morris Oliver,"March 30, 2020",4," I really enjoy this app. My only complaints are that it is difficult to go back to pins that I liked, but didn't save, and when I'm falling asleep I sometimes close a pin because my finger is on it. How do you start back viewing pins that have been closed?"
217,Kelsey Licastro,"April 8, 2020",5," So many things to look at. Making boards is super easy. Its just got everything you want to look at in one spot! Been using it for years as a teacher, home builder, designer, foodie, and mom."
218,Troy Lambert,"April 12, 2020",4, I resisted using this great app even though it seemed to be everywhere I went online searching for images. Then I tried it out and was impressed with the ease of finding and the range of imagery on Pinterest. It's now one of my first go-tos for image research and banking.

Now I am trying to delete the 2nd account to make a new account cause I have given up getting my main one again and the page off the email and its sends me to a white page. Not happy when I have to deal with this and having charger issues with my phone
231,Colin Sydney,"April 3, 2020",1, After an update. The app just doesn't load as fast. I thought it might be my internet. But it's not. Everything else is working perfectly. I can watch full HD videos well on YouTube.. So I don't know what you did with the update. But it sucks.
232,Pamela Cochrane,"April 15, 2020",2," I often have difficulty finding the directions for the craft. Plenty of pictures but too many side trips to things that have nothing to do with what im trying to find. When i click on photo, im taken on a maze of sideroads."

235,Annette Johnson,"April 6, 2020",3, I use Pinterest for patterns and ideas. Too often there are links that do not end up at a pattern. It can take a long time with multiple jumps to get to the very annoying and frustrating conclusion
236,Lisa Fornal,"April 18, 2020",4," There are many great pins. I have found a few that lead to nowhere. I really like when recipes show the ingredients before opening the link. It would be nice to add comments for myself, meaning not to be public."
237,Sharon Khan,"April 23, 2020",4," I love Pinterest. My wish would be to allow reverse listing of pins, not just re-arrangement so you can see older pins without having to scroll down all the way. Make it easier to add/delete preferences."
238,Eleanor King,"April 24, 2020",5," I love Pinterest! It has some great DIY projects, a lot of which I make and use daily. There are lots of diverse and interesting ideas and subjects that give lots of practical and useful information."

298,sparkle unicorn,"April 9, 2020",5, Love this app!!! Almost always gives me the inspiration I need !!🙂 I also love that it has links of where to get the stuff so I dont need to search all over! Totally reccomend 👍
299,DC Shpd,"March 30, 2020",5," Endless ideas, step by step instructions for the most part. It would be more efficient if when you clicked on an image it would go full size and NOT redirect to another link where you have to look for the original image again."

303,Naomi Mekeel,"April 21, 2020",4," This app is great! My only complaint is that sometimes the feature for pinning from the web fails to load, which hinders me from creating my own original pins rather than just saving other people's. Otherwise it works as expected!"
304,Sonya Kallstrom,"April 19, 2020",5," Pinterest is fantastic! The recipes and different products are amazing. I have at times spent hours on pinterest because there are so many great ideas, so many great products and I always amp learning new great things"
305,Mikayla Best,"April 15, 2020",4, I don't like how it shows you pins based off of your followers instead of what you save to your boards. I once tried follow for follow and inapropriate pictures would pop up. Other than that I love it!
306,Alpha Omega,"April 21, 2020",3," Needs the ability to bookmark, so that you don't find that the home screen content has changed due to auto refresh when you exit and then re-enter the app. Also dislike the floating menu."
307,Barbara Price-Mills,"April 21, 2020",2," Love the app, HATE THE POP UP VIDEOS!! Everytime I try to read a pin some popup video blocks the content so you can't read it...EVERYTIME! Help center was NO help at all!! Ready to uninstall if not fixed!!"

334,Bryn Swain,"April 1, 2020",4," A generally great app for browsing, storing and sharing inspiration. I just wish that Pinterest had a way to ensure that the original creator of the image is always cited, even through subsequent re-pinnings. Stolen pins are a major problem."

373,Misty DeChant,"April 6, 2020",2, Pinterest has fallen into the trap. They sold out for money. There used to be less ads. I don't use it much anymore! I would have been happy to pay for a NON AD VERSION! It's like every other social media ad fest now. Not worth it.
374,Lorri K.,"April 9, 2020",5," I've missed being on this app. I had an old account but, I couldn't get into it. So, I had to start ALL over. VERY grateful I could still see ALL of my boards so I could duplicate the ones I wanted!!!❤🖤💜💕"
375,Sally Nuna,"April 13, 2020",4, Absolutely brilliant app. The only negative thing I would say is that sometimes when you click on to follow a recipe it takes you all over the place and more often than not you get shown everything else but the recipe you wanted.

It's still a good platform but the paper airplane icon was more fun for sending pins, the spinning pin was fun when boards or pins loaded, sending from a desktop was easier because it didn't look like you were uploading where is now it does look like you're uploading.

Anytime I find something interesting it takes me to a third party website which collects my data and bombs my screen with ads. When i try to close the ad it takes me back to Pinterest home. Basically Pinterest is a middle man sending you to unprotected sites that gather cookies for future ads to show you. So now I use it for dog memes and funny cat pics.

664,BSD SUDHESH KUMAR,"April 10, 2020",1," I saw its website to download movie, but there is no movie played. Payment required for each item. This is a shopping app only. Amazon prime is better as compare this app because amazon gives movies, songs and shopping."

670,rae chute,"April 18, 2020",3, I hate the fact that you have to go looking for the instructions instead of it coming right up when you click on anything. Other wise it gives great ideas.

I used to be able to click on broad categories (DIY, Food and drink, Gardening, etc.) and see a wide variety of items and ideas. Those categories are no longer available in the search. Pinterest has tried to become too intuitive, so what I see is too similar to what Ive already pinned. Sometimes I want to exlore and see random things. I'm using Pinterest much less now that this is gone."

Legend has it you are supposed to use it for DIY project documentation. Despite this uncertainty, it is well designed. It hasn't crashed on my personal computer nor on my phones.

I thoroughly enjoy this app. It allows you to organize your thoughts and hone in on a personal style or pin point whatever idea you are trying to piece together. With the added ability to take pics from other sites, you can pin them to your current boards which allows you to further personalize and enhance your boards. I'm not sure if you are limited to the amount of boards but this app is very helpful in giving ideas for just about anything. I absolutely love this app!"

They also banned quotes about being sad or depressed. When a lot of people used those quotes to make themselves feel better or not feel alone.

1514,Kelly Williams,"March 23, 2020",5, Pinterest has a whole lot of everything you could possibly want to either look at or want to own. My favorite item(s) to view are minuatures of real products we use in our own home lives & anything about camping life and how to live more spaciously in small square footage.

1545,Susan Hensley,"February 9, 2020",4," Pinterest use to be so easy to navigate. You could post a picture, no big deal. Now I have to allow you to see my contacts and my pictures.

1606,Barbara Clingman,"February 29, 2020",4, This is my go to for every idea and every recipe. I like that the app picks up what I looked at and then shows variations of the same. I don't like that my feed then significantly limits me seeing anything new that may be available or trending or simply a whole different direction.
1607,Debi Potts,"March 28, 2020",4," I used to enjoy Pinterest a lot more. That's why 4 stars, not 5. Too many ads, too many pop up videos and re-directs. Also, do bloggers get paid by the word? They go on forever. Like the ""jump to recipe"" most of all!"

It's one of my most used features and I do not see the point in getting rid of it. Not having it makes me want to use the app less.
1698,Jen Sea,"February 13, 2020",2," It's sure something to see meat dish ideas, meat advertisements, ect when I'm a vegetarian siding on vegan.

Believe me...Full ReviewIt's sure something to see meat dish ideas, meat advertisements, ect when I'm a vegetarian siding on vegan. No matter how many times I click don't show, not relevant, there is always plenty to take their place after refresh/close/open. This is not the only topic Pinterest does this about. Believe me if I wanted to see these things, I'd have them on my boards. I would specifically search them out. Never have I ever. Even after I wrote to their comment/complaint section nothing changed. 👎"
1699,Joelle K.,"February 12, 2020",4," This app is great. Helps me find almost anything I'm looking for, ranging from food and fashion, to photography and business.

1701,Samantha Del Duca,"February 18, 2020",3," I miss being able to browse by a list of topics. Everything is repetitive, including the ridiculous amount of ads. I'd like to be able to one-click organize pins within boards by similarities/relevance. And I wish prices of items pinned show up in Pinterest as a mini badge icon."
1702,Lilian De maine,"February 26, 2020",4," I find a lot of places are not what they say they are... I don't add friends, I use the app to find things and to learn new things, I also find some places so full of adds that you have trouble finding what you want.. but I enjoy Pinterest"

1731,Karen Turner,"February 23, 2020",2," Too many ads on Pinterest. Lovedthe app when it started. Now it is full of spam; you click on a subject of interest, but are then directed to a sales page. Too much scrolling and dodging ads to find content. I prefer to find my information on YouTube."

1820,Guuleed Cabdikariim,"February 11, 2020",4," It crashes sometimes with a message saying something like 'well, that's awkward ...' and when it does it doesn't work for me for about 5 minutes. Good when it works, annoying when it doesn't. It happens about twice a week for me."
1821,Vivi P,"March 1, 2020",5," I love it so much!!! As a preschool teacher with little time, I just love taking a quick look at a picture of a project on pinterest and deciding if it fits my lesson. No more chunky books to sift through for ideas."

Also hate reading someone's life story about the recipe or pattern and finally six pages later you might come to the actual recipe or instructions but for a price.

Terrible program do not trust it.
1825,Laura Valentine,"March 19, 2020",4," I would like to be able to zoom into a picture without the search thing coming up and a way to have easy, visable comments with people in shared boards and an option to view pins full screen while scrolling like IG. Otherwise its great."

1843,Stefanie Shuffler,"March 21, 2020",5," Excellent agorithm for related items to easily form themed boards. Also, great organization options! Only complaint is that some changes (even when improvements) aren't always communicated, and can come as a surprise."

1879,Debbie Vickery,"February 20, 2020",3, Not liking how new update has the search icon and boards on a little pop up. Half the time I can't get the search bar to come up. Also doesn't seem to give you heads up that you've already pinned something.
1880,Donna Wright,"February 22, 2020",5, Everything n anything I need or look for is here! I use Pinterest more than my cookbooks... and I collect them!!! So much more available and so many of my family recipes.... I was shocked... I love pintrest!!!!
1881,Vicki Hawes,"February 27, 2020",2," When I click on a pin and then go back, every video on the page starts playing at once and there is no way of stopping the noise. It's incredibly annoying. Just a simple mute option would be great.."
1882,Karen Fisher,"February 28, 2020",5, I really like the pic of actors bands and music A lot of the lil memes and quotes are funny but But then there's supportive 1. I really like the DIY and games/ things for kids to do rather then Playn on xbox and playstation. They are fun. a Lot of family and friends enjoy this app
1883,Evelyn Satterwhite,"March 1, 2020",2," When pinterest first began i really enjoyed it. Search, find & save without too much effort. Now way too many adds. Search, scroll, scroll & sometimes find the -whatever it is- or not. Almost too much trouble to deal with."

1886,KIRSTY Garrod,"March 20, 2020",3, I like it. It's a nice place to keep all your ideas together. The only issue is that sometimes you can't scroll through your sublists. And I miss the like button. And if you try to pin a gif from another site it doesn't always work
1887,Violet Chinamale,"March 26, 2020",4," I love the app, but I don't like the ""back to feed"" button that pops up at the bottom. Accidentally pressing that & I have to start searching again when I don't want to return to the feed."

1907,William Anderson,"January 31, 2020",5," Amazing transformation from clunky, slow, unresponsive app to lightning fast and far better algorithm for understanding what someone likes. Dark mode is a bonus hoped for, now realized. Thank you for the efforts and listening to everyone."

1913,Joanne Rafferty,"February 3, 2020",4, Great concept but feel the recent updates have made the interface harder to navigate. Also when you block someone it would be nice to have the option to unblock them again on the app.
1914,Sarah Larsen,"January 31, 2020",5, Great! the only problem is that I can only log in once. after that everytime I open the app it says that there is a problem. this is not a huge problem but one that should probably be fixed.
1915,Rhonda Carkner,"February 9, 2020",4," I don""t like that the app searches and provides pins that they think I want to see based on past searches. I should be able to say "" I'm not interesed in seeing wedding dresses any more""."
1916,Shecola Taylor,"February 17, 2020",4," I love Pinterest. The only critique I have is some of the content gets recycle too often, some of the food doesn't have recipes attached to them. Otherwise it's a great app it's my favorite one. I love Pinterest 😍"
1917,Andre P.,"February 10, 2020",4," Only thing that I don't like about the app is that black magnifying glass in the bottom right corner of every photo you look at. Often blocks out part of the words on memes etc. Other than that, I like it."
1918,Stanisle Napuka,"February 15, 2020",5," I love Pinterest, its where i get more ideas for my hairdressing tutorials and styles, it has all types of quote for everything. Only thing is that i can't download videos directly from Pinterest and it sucks."

1920,F Khan,"February 15, 2020",4," Love the app, I have recently experienced when trying to hide pins which I am not interested in they would not be hidden. Adding, editing and search functions work well. Have not tried many other features like sharing etc."
1921,Cheryl Robson,"February 22, 2020",4, I have saved several recipes to try. The only change that I would make would be to show the recipe with the instructions and ingredients list on the first look without having to wait for the view screen.
1922,LB,"March 1, 2020",3, I enjoy pinterest greatly but am not happy with the pins shown to me in my home feed. Hardly anything is relevant or something I would choose. I prefer looking for pins I like myself and I loath a lot of what is deemed popular based on pop culture etc. But other than that it is my favourite app.
1923,BLACKPINK'S DAUGHTER,"March 8, 2020",5, Pinterest has to be THE most amazing app so far.

1956,Owner,"January 28, 2020",5," Addictive. Endless quality images to select from and keep as reference. I renovate and decorate homes and find Pinterest inspirational. Only negative is that sometimes you select a image and you get many links and excessive advertising, which puts me off."
1957,Brandi Waskul,"February 4, 2020",4," I see too much of the same stuff, dont want to see the f word but cant filter it out, and miss the old 'like' option. Otherwise, its a fun place to waste time."

1961,Manav Agarwal,"February 25, 2020",2, I used to love the app then suddenly you downgraded your image quality and the joy of scanning through all the various artwork in admired now no longer has the same charm. Please revert back to the original graphic quality which really made the app worthwhile.
1962,Carrie Batton,"February 26, 2020",4, I like it a lot but I wish it would stay on the same page I was on last but everytime I pull it back up it immediately changes. Wish it would remember my last three save categories instead of just the last one.

2072,Chloe Lewis,"February 28, 2020",3, there should be a way to turn off audio coming through this app. it messes with podcasts and they often come from videos that aren't visible for several scrolls. then sometimes they don't turn off until you back out really far from your deep dive
2073,Barbara Mcmurray,"April 2, 2020",5," You Can Find Any Thing on Pinterest, I Love This APP! It is The Best! Barbara"
2074,Leia Marie S,"April 14, 2020",1, After the last update I can't do anything. It's telling me user can't be found...

2076,Joanne Hicklin,"April 17, 2020",5, Enjoy searching for sewing articals and for something new. An interesting app.
2077,Ravi zxcvbnm,"February 3, 2020",3, Some times before we can chat more comfortably with any body on Pinterest. But now messages are not appeared on screen at the moment even on online condition when you chat with anyone. You have to go on notification Then message will update on your chat screen... Disgusting... 😖
2078,Cinnabun,"February 27, 2020",2," Its good for ideas and saving pictures, but now I cant see the comments, nor can I move pins anymore! Also its such a weird set up now and I dont like it! Could you please put it back to the old set up/ looks everything else is fine."
2079,Ray A,"January 31, 2020",1, It's now used to try to SELL stuff. I used to use this app to find out how to do crafts. Now everything I click on is something somebody is trying to SELL ! This app is junk now. Totally useless to me ! Very disappointed with Pinterest now. Will probably remove app soon.
2080,Gurudutt Kashyap,"February 2, 2020",4, App is best. New UI is awesome. but new update 8.3.0 is so laggy. Even so many times my mobile network goes on and off automatically during using this app. This is the first time i am facing this type of issue in any app.
2081,Aaron L,"February 17, 2020",1, The search function sucks. It used to be really good where I could search my pins but now I have to search pin by pin by pin. Now I search on Google and get my recipe that way. Fix it or I'm out.
2082,Andrea Passarell,"February 19, 2020",4, I might be lowkey addicted to this app. The one main detractor is that lots of the web pages that get linked have a lot of pop ups that are hard to avoid with the app. I would love for the devs to find some way to help with that.
2083,Daeonna Walls,"February 14, 2020",5," Gives you great ideas. Once you look up something you'll never wanna stop looking. If you have no idea of the clothes you want to wear or pickout, pinterest is the way. I promise."
2084,Diabetic Doll,"February 14, 2020",2," I love Pinterest but I'll stick to scrolling on my laptop instead of this app, it's always crashing, never fully loading. It sucks. And it's the only app that does this to me. Even with no other apps open and strong wifi."
2085,Rebecca Sassine,"February 11, 2020",2," Rating for usability... can't open images full size in a board and swipe through, you have to go back each time and open the next image. Better to use Google image search."
2086,Linda Bennett,"February 16, 2020",4," Love this app. Great diy's, recipes,info and more . Just hate the pushyness of ads . Hate that they want my phone number. Don't mind giving my email. So persistent and annoying. Still love pinterest, my favorite site mostly."
2087,Ereth Hammari,"February 14, 2020",3," I like the ideas it gives at times, but i often see the same stuff over and over and many links are broken and old. It works well though!"
2088,Serena McConville,"February 21, 2020",5," Love Pinterest! I can find any and all my interests! So many great ideas and so many knowledgeable and creative people. This is my go to for recipes, books, diy, etc...I visit daily! Thank you! Great experience!"
2089,Diane Jones,"March 3, 2020",5, I just love Pinterest and there are so many great things to discover and share.. All interests can be pinned and enjoyed and its a great way of discovering new things.. Just one thing though... Beware as it is very addictive but good fun!
2090,Tony Danzey,"March 7, 2020",5," A co-worker turned me on to Pinterest just for clothing ideas, but oh my God, Pinterest has everything in it! I'm buying a new home and the different ideas alone are a sight to behold, I've pinned so much and cant wait for more! Best app ever!"
2091,R Maxwell,"March 7, 2020",5," I've come to love this app it's easy to use and very entertaining, lots of options & helpful at every turn. I've made some friends on this app , we can talk back and forth about our boards & material exchange ideas etc. Try this app, you'll be glad you did!"
2092,Beverly Grobe,"March 7, 2020",5," Always find things I can use or ideas in all areas of interest. I wish it didn't have so many ads. Sometimes it's hard to fight through the junk, so I give up. All in all, it's got a lot of great info and help."
2093,James Sprague,"March 16, 2020",5," totally awesome....especially the man-cave posts...or the Anime, or Fantasy Art!!! This is where the up and coming graphic artists hang out and post up right beside the seasoned professional artist...not to mention the recipes for CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! hahahaha. lol lol-whitefang/jimmy."
2094,liv f,"March 17, 2020",1, Each update makes the app harder and harder to use mine wont let me move pins to a different broad or section unless it a long process to move one and then i have to repeat that process for each pin and i cant report prombles in the help area all in will let me do is search for help articles
2095,Sherill Maddox,"March 17, 2020",4," It picks up very quickly when you take a little detour in what you normally look at and your feed will get flooded with that detour. Otherwise, love it!"
2096,Nadine Ekstrom,"March 23, 2020",2," I hate how slow it opens and when I want to see instructions of a recipe, sometimes it blacks out. i don't like that submitted things won't let me view them unless I follow or join their site. I don't like when you say such n such wants you to see ""this"" or ""these"". don't anticipate what I might lik...Full ReviewI hate how slow it opens and when I want to see instructions of a recipe, sometimes it blacks out. i don't like that submitted things won't let me view them unless I follow or join their site.

2097,Ronda Carter,"March 24, 2020",5," I Love this website,especially for teacher's. One major downside and too much time consuming is, is that Teacher's pay teacher's has taken over on Pinterest and it wastes alot of my time finding out that you have to pay, especially when it comes up saying free."
2098,Massiel Rodriguez,"March 23, 2020",5, Pinterest is my favorite social media site. It allows me to pin my colored pages for others to view and get inspired from them. It is a good way to come accross other colorists and crafters.
2099,Michele S,"March 28, 2020",5, I just wish you had more control when using the app on cell phone The capability to alphabeticalize your saves.
2100,Craig Maiura,"March 29, 2020",5, Its a great app for what ever your interested in and at times they give ideas to keep. Best app i'v ever been on. I'v had this app for years and people from all over follow what i save.

2114,Mortem Reaper,"February 5, 2020",3," The page is slow as hell to load and when it does it's usually blurry. It's annoying and tends to piss me off, especially when I'm trying to actually find art or references to look at"
2115,Sahidkhan H THEBA,"February 12, 2020",5," This is very good..you need someone's opinion or advice or make up sense and dressing sense and other topic so it is very useful he ....If there were more than 5 stars, then like in the universe, I would give all the stars, I just love Pinterest😍"
2116,Susan Swinskey,"February 23, 2020",4," Can't access when Facebook work let you access. you have a parasydic relationship with Google also. Your codes don't work with Facebook. There is no one to call and it renders new phones that need to switch contact info, gmail, Google, pinterest apps totally useless. Go solo."
2117,angie xcatsx,"February 29, 2020",5," I love this app so much, it gives so many creative ideas when i get a form of ""writers block"" while making something decor-wise for the house or even when doing my hair."

2121,Agnes Maria,"February 20, 2020",4," Decent app over all, although it gets very slow, freezes and crashes quite often. Otherwise, the Pinterest app is a good idea and should continue to be developed, and stabilized."
2122,Blue NovaRose,"February 3, 2020",3, Loved the app for years but not really liking the new interface and the amount of adds have been overwhelming. Has taken multiple reinstalls to work after constant updates. Great content and app just need to work some things out.
2123,Monique Seaman,"February 4, 2020",4, Great for getting many ideas and images for anything I can think of! Fake articles and advertorial are rampant. I cannot trust a link for factual info so I skip all that. Too many ads. Links that lead to porn are unacceptable on this forum.
2124,Laura Bassett,"February 2, 2020",5, My favorite app!!! I can get info on anything from cooking to beauty with the easy to use search button. The best part is being able to save you favorite things and organize it into folders.
2125,Rachael Elliott,"February 2, 2020",1," since most recent updates, can't load a full picture. only loads up a very zoomed in version cannot scroll across the picture to see the rest, can't un-zoom the picture. lagging and bugging out and performing a forced close"
2126,Matthew Johnson,"February 2, 2020",1, The ads here are ridiculous!!! You click on any te pie and boom ads popping up everywhere getting in your way. Sometimes it takes me off the page and I cant even look at the recipe. You are a disgrace pinterest. Like it's not enjoyable
2127,Judith Prince,"February 5, 2020",5, Love all the amazing boards. Very interesting to go through. Looking at one board which then takes me down to another. Have gotten some great hacks for all kinds of things and passing it on to my friends
2128,Sheila Lehman,"February 5, 2020",5, Pinterest is one of my favorite apps! So much information on anything that interests you. It's like a never-ending magazine with all your favorite things and folders to organize it all for later.
2129,jezebel _,"February 5, 2020",2," Considering its IPO, and how long it's been around, the UX could do with a lot more investment. Certain navigation and processes have simply been ignored and are disruptively slow and clunky. UI is okay. Dark mode option is useful."
2130,Joseph Winters,"February 11, 2020",5," I love this app. I gotten ideas galore, recipes, tips etc, etc, etc. I find it helpful and you let your imagination run wild. If you get you will know exactly what I mean. Enjoy!!!!"

2132,Suresh Chidambaram,"February 24, 2020",3," Pinterest is the only app which doesn't respect dark mode for notifications. It looks super weird with illegible text. Please avoid unnecessary customization, it's very difficult to see. On the other hand the app is fantastic."
2133,Kirsten Willis,"February 23, 2020",4," It's an OK app, but for some reason it's not possible to search only within your own pins. I find this really frustrating - what's the point of amassing hundreds of dinner recipes if you can't search them?"
2134,Indian Zaika,"February 23, 2020",5," I loved this app. But I think the stories feature should be available for everyone as I love posting stories of quotes ,facts, etc. Otherwise this app is awesome . Keep it up 😊"
2135,Kerry Bruce,"March 2, 2020",5, I absolutely love Pinterest! It's Awesome to be able to see artwork of many genres from all over the world. It helps develop a great respect for the many art forms which helps in enriching your life.
2136,Cccc Pppp,"March 9, 2020",3, I like Pinterest but the only thing I can't understand is why you can't reorder pins inside of a section. I mean I've been doing it since years and now suddenly you just can't? That's terrible I hope you change it because it's super frustrating
2137,Rosie Barnes,"March 15, 2020",4," Love the app but recently when I have gone on it when I tap on an image and go to swipe to the next when it won't do it is it my phone, my WiFi or what so confused and annoyed. Does anyone else have this happen?"
2138,Jenise Steinman,"March 15, 2020",5," A nice variety of topics, usually well presented. Lately, there are more ads, with lots of repetitions, but still palatable."
2139,Haley Lynch,"March 15, 2020",4, Awesome. Great ideas. Good feedback. Only negative I'd say is some of the links to click on to get more info tend to he viruses. Other than that all good
2140,Alyson Bartolomie,"March 18, 2020",3," I don't really like the new update, I want to swipe to other images without having to get out of the one I clicked. I also want to be able to comment. There is also many lewd images. Otherwise, it's alright."
2141,Rosemary Gurrola,"March 10, 2020",3," I WAS happy with my Pinterest until i updated,than i lost EVERYTHING!! What the hey,wberes my stuff,when someone like my stuff that i saved from my 1st pintrest that i lost,when i click on it,it says im not permitted,on MY OWN PINS! REALLY! HOW DO I GET THEM BACK?!"
2142,Stubsiana Jones,"March 18, 2020",3," Yo development team, can y'all get rid of the stupid blue pop up that says ""hold to add a reaction"" cause I can't see what's happening on the screen and it's annoying af. At least make it go away of have a swipe to clear function or something"
2143,ddfcoold,"March 12, 2020",1," 7.20 used to have good interface, now there's annoying clunky toolbar and in dark theme the notification about downloading image is still white, right into your eyeballs. And these round corners, gosh, interface now takes half of the screen ("
2144,Kennith Simmons,"March 17, 2020",1, I've spent nearly a month trying to get help for a bug (boards' descriptions getting deleted and being unable to be viewed) and trying to discern if it's a bug or a feature and I've only recieved vague answers multiple weeks after I've sent the emails.
2145,Tammy Geer,"March 17, 2020",4, It's a great app. I love it. It just seems to run my battery down real fast other than that I can find everything I need that pertains to all my hobbies and interests.

2161,Francisco Fuentes,"February 2, 2020",2," I like the new UI, but the notifications only show up for 6 months and older. Meaning, I can't reopen my recent notifications. Also, when I try to open my push notif's, it sends me to a blank page saying i can't access it"
2162,Carlos Dominguez,"January 30, 2020",5," I love it, it's to bad. Most of the things don't show you viewable or printable plans, you have to subscribe and pay just to see something, other than that I think is great"
2163,Lorelei Oaklyn,"March 8, 2020",4," I'd love to easily be able to delete a single pin without going into edit, but other than that, it's amazing. My previous review was inaccurate because I had somehow missed the mass delete option"

2172,Ellen Nahrwold,"February 3, 2020",4, Love Pinterest! You can spend hours on this app! Anything and everything is found here. The reason for the 5th star missing is because some links take you nowhere (ads) or open to that scam announcement that you won something
2173,Raquel Harrison,"January 30, 2020",4," It's a great app. I had it for years. However, it freezes on me so I have to get out of the app and go back in it. I lose where I was and have to try and find the pin again."
2174,Lori L,"January 31, 2020",5, I love this app!! You can find anything you are looking for from recipes to crafts to home ideas to seasonal decoration trends. Just type in your interests and relevant pins come up or search for something by name....wonderful.

2177,Harrie van Asselt,"February 11, 2020",4," Love it. Lately I am not so happy with certain ads that come in between. The use of some vulgar language by some, is not necessary."

2179,Evelyn,"February 7, 2020",4," I use pinterest daily. Such a great app. But lately it shows me the same stuff, over and over again, even if I refresh the page."
2180,Dona Barman,"February 9, 2020",1, There is too much ad whenever you open any article. Please try to reduce or organize in a proper way which will not cause any problem to readers.
2181,Nancy Williams,"February 20, 2020",4," I enjoy pinterest very much. BUT now when I open some of the articles it opens into something other than what the front picture indicates a lot of ads etc. So don't know if pinterest is aware, but I rather not see this it takes my time."

2184,Amber Bell,"March 8, 2020",5," Super addictive! Any interest you have is played out here in detail. It gives you the ability to save and organize multiple sites, images, tips, and ads to your hearts content! Great way to plan."
2185,Elena Carroll,"March 7, 2020",4, Great app. Ads are a bit annoying but you can manage them to some extent. Wish you could over write or remove description on ads and other links. I'm usually just wanting the pictures to appear on my boards.
2186,TR Page,"March 14, 2020",3," I like being able to keep the things I like. However, it's tough sometimes to find the correct star to push on some of the pins, it takes me to""images"" instead."

Years of enjoyment wiped out and not through my own choice. I'm still angry but am slowing rebuilding. YOU DID THIS invading my page without permission."

Plus if you pick a pin they show and any suggestive or nudity is shown they threaten you with bared from the app! I had beautiful pins of all kinds that I thought exceptional then my email got changed and poof! Could never see any of them again. Beware, less you lose what you hold dear cause it can be conducted, or kept, hid or lost."

2206,Shonda Davis,"February 13, 2020",3, I've been using Pinterest for close to a decade and have loved it! Unfortunately I have to dock it a couple stars now due to all the ads!!!!
2207,Judy Wiese,"February 21, 2020",4, I love Pinterest the reason o only give it a 4 is because the business side you cannot have just a normal vertical picture. It's sideways with many things and it's not very appealing and hard to look at
2208,Patty Downing,"March 20, 2020",5," So many crafts! (They have so many other categories too, not just crafts). Pintrest will also get your creative juices flowing. All a person needs is time and supplies."
2209,fluffykitten _-12,"March 19, 2020",4," I love the app it's great. It's just everytime I try to search anything in the search bar the app freezes up and goes off. So I'm putting 4 stars for now, I'll add 5 when the problem fixes."

2214,Ilze Dienava-Verdoold,"February 4, 2020",5," A lovely tool to look up and gather ideas, if only sometimes it's annoying that the homefeed refreshes automatically just as you spotted something interesting...and it's gone."
2215,Sarah Gantenbein,"February 4, 2020",3," Like it, but I wish it would have an auto-choose feature so I dont have to keep choosing the same board individually when I'm saving a whole group of pins to it. It would save so much time!"
2216,Elizabeth V. C.P,"February 6, 2020",3, It's cool and I recently signed up but I can't seem to add more broad topics like how it asked me to do when I signed up and I think this feature should be added in instead of having to follow someone.
2217,Andrea Roberts,"February 7, 2020",5, Love it overall. Not a fan of items you have to join to see the post. I just dont go there. A few to many commercial site thst string you along but overall I do appreciate pintrest
2218,Teresia Stovall,"February 17, 2020",5," My Login to Pinterest each day helps to squeeze my creative juices. I recommend this site all the time. My go to site for how to information has shifted to Pinterest over, YouTube , Wikipedia, and even Google."
2219,Lauree Gilbrook,"February 20, 2020",4," I like the app because of the wide variety of ideas, tutorials and information. However sometimes when I do a search for something and click on ""Visit"" it takes me to a page that is not related to what I was looking at."

2221,Xaka León,"February 26, 2020",2," Too many ads. It's not as good as it used to be. A good half of the ""ideas"" before I swipe upward will be ads rather than actual ideas. That's not why I joined Pinterest years ago."
2222,Emily Smith,"February 25, 2020",5," Love it! I can connect with my friends and work with them on boards. It can be used for anything from recipes, clothes, and crafts to memes and hilarious sayings/pictures."
2223,Shankowsky Shannon,"February 27, 2020",5, Really cool. Not only you can make the boards of your pins private but also now you can add your own photos on pinterest. I really adore the new updates pinterest has made.
2224,Yazmin Machuca,"March 2, 2020",5, Pinterest is more than a digital inspiration board. It is a source for connecting and finding your tribe and other like minded entrepreneurs. A place where you can plan to build your dreams. I love it!
2225,Waikiki Crabbe,"March 3, 2020",5," The best app ever. I get new fresh pins, only related to what I like and often what I search up a lot. This app has helped me a lot planning events and gifts. This app is also very useful to just browse ideas. I definitely recommend"
2226,Kim Brewer,"March 2, 2020",2, Hate all the freaking ads. I miss the old setup for searches. I don't like seeing suggestions from my own pins. I would rather search like we did in the old days.
2227,Helen Tatum,"March 11, 2020",4," I love Pinterest. It is so easy to find a recipe for any occasion, whether holiday or simple meals. I don't have to look through recipe books anymore, that is a plus for me. I just go to Pinterest."
2228,Susan Teeninga,"March 13, 2020",2, Love the app except for the spinning wheel of death every time I try to look at pintrest for more than 10 min. I've tried clearing my cache and reinstalling the app all to no avail.
2229,Christydmullins Mullins,"March 22, 2020",5, I love the recipes. Only thing I would change are the pop ups while trying to read recipes. And the long stories about the recipes.
2230,ALie,"March 17, 2020",2," I cant open pics from gallery and post it and sometimes when i try to search something in the app, it'll keep saying there is no Internet connection or we cant find that topic when later on you can find it easily."
2231,Robin Hurt,"March 21, 2020",3, There are times that it doesn't take me to the recipe. I also feel that the recipe ingredients and directions should be before or at least 1 paragraph down before all there talking.
2232,Sarah,"March 19, 2020",4," I can very easily find what im looking for, i use it for tattoo ideas and skin care home remedies mainly which the amount of different pins to choose from is endless. If u cant find it on pinterest then your probably not going to find it."

2269,Time-Travelling Fairy,"February 5, 2020",1, Every week it seems like this app just keeps getting shittier and shittier. It's gotten to the point where I can't even search the pins I've saved even though I've specified it as such.

2273,MrMcIntyre1220,"February 21, 2020",4, Awesome app however there is way too many ads and redirects. They should come out with a premium version for those who don't want to see ads and have 5 redirects in order to obtain a recipe.

Maybe the website works different, but i doubt it. Why cant you people that program stuff do something that actually works?!"
2280,Michelle Walters,"March 10, 2020",1," You can't even read what you want without 50 million pop ups getting in the way! So hard to find the X to get rid of it! Plus to get to print a recipe is a hot mess! Pinterest has really gone down hill, very poor service now."

I love the fanart, comedy, and relation I find on this app. The only reason I give this app a 4 star is because of how many spoilers for shows I've discovered.

It crashes constantly, delays when you try to click on something, and often you'll lose everything you've saved, as Pinterest has spontaneously deleted your account. I've notified Pinterest several times explaining the extremely frustrating bugs and malfunctions in the app, they haven't done a single thing about it. Thanks for caring so much about the satisfaction of your customers."

Many of the new changes were unnecessary and make several features more difficult to use or access. I almost always quit for a few days after I accidentally block something I intended to pin. Sometimes it will put you in a feedback loop when you're not intending to only pin one type of recommended content for hours. It's just getting old real quick.

In my mind the concept sounded great, no more searching for an item you saw on pintrest. This app is awful, does not seem to be well thought out at all, nor professionally done.

However, I wish that Pinterest would allow me to rearrange the pins within my folders. I'd like to be able to move them around and change their order within a folder. That way, I could compare pins more easily and discover duplicates. (Right now, ferreting out duplicates in a folder containing hundreds of pins is difficult, a real pain.) But on the whole, thank you for an interesting app!"

I understand the idea behind the aesthetic, but the application of the aesthetic is very busy and over the top. I hate that they got rid of the multi select tool for boards because it makes it difficult when you realize that you saved multiple pins in the wrong section of the board and/or wrong board entirely. I'd prefer if they brought back the old layout. 2/5 stars for now."

However, the newest update changes how you can view individual pins (at least on the mobile app) Only a fraction of the pin appears after you begin to scroll down.

Everything may not be your ' cup of tea ', but I guarantee there are areas that include your interests or hobbies. I love it, and have found many, many helpful articles and ideas!! My only concern is that some (few) postings are inappropriate with language and images. I believe it should stay 'family friendly' as all ages access it for ideas, fun activities, and creative inspiration."

Pinterest forces you to stay within their ecosystem and watch a fake 3 second loading bar to discourage you from leaving. This is a platform built on user content with original posters removed. If you have to use Pinterest just stick to desktop.

I just tried to save a link for natural cleansers. It's not a suspicious link, but Pinterest marks it that way and won't let me save it. I'll save it in Google Drive. If Google starts censoring I'll have to find another place. I would like Pinterest to allow me to decide what i want to save/think 4 myself."
