Layout is bad, dashboards won't load. And still, no email logging. If you pay for a Salesforce account you should be able to use all features on all of you devices and not have to pay extra to have basic and important features on mobile devices."

But I hv never seen such a useless app like SFDC, I think they are into 17 century, considering the speed while login.Just to log in it need minimum 10-15 minutes.Even after many updates still I'm facing it.several time contacted over mail to fix the issue.But no use.Better skip the SFDC if anyone is planning to use this CRM"
2,Faizullah Siddique,"April 20, 2020",5, Best CRM. As a sales person whatever the things you needed to record or to do is available on it.
3,Joshua Rosario,"February 6, 2020",5, Now I have only used one Other app for work such as this which was Asana. I loved Asana because i got used to it.

However when it comes to a platform you can adjust to your needs. This one is very flexible. I love my view as a manager and i have almost everything in my Dashboard alone. I use this for a management company to handle cases for all areas from leasing to maintenance repairs. Everything lives in Salesforce and i must say it really has made a difference.

Still needs improvements to be more useful. The comment field is only two lines of text, very hard to organize notes in such a small window. Needs the ability to add photos/video to notes as attachment. Hope these improvements can be addressed soon."
5,ankush baveja,"April 23, 2020",1, Loading .. Loading .. I am able to search cases but going inside any case it does not work and just keeps loading
6,Russ Kimzey,"March 13, 2020",1," Seriously un useable, why bother, one size doesn't fit all. The desktop functional use case is predicated on the executive use case for the software as in modeling a pipeline. Not in features and functionality that makes sales forces more efficient.

The desktop functional use case is predicated on the executive use case for the software as in modeling a pipeline. Not in features and functionality that makes sales forces more efficient. In actuality, sales force makes work for sales teams. This app is useless and only further perpetuates how disconnected top down management is from the day to day of front line operations and sales teams. Back to the lap top."
7,J D,"April 16, 2020",1," This is the most worthless app ever. The desktop version is bad enough, but this takes the cake. I need to see what company my customer is with. Can't see it. I need to generate docs. Won't work. Absolutely a worthless waste of space and time."
8,Madalin Dinoiu,"February 12, 2020",1," Awful app. So counterintuitive. Looks like a glorified spreadsheet. Took me 10 minutes to find out how to approve a contract. In ""contract history"" why!? Why would you have there the approve button. Same with the ""lightning"" on desktop, cartoonish and counterintuitive."
9,J. Daniel Sink,"March 9, 2020",1," Salesforce mobile app has no help support and cannot reset my password. If you use reset password option, it sends you an email link. Use the link and it takes you right back to same login screen with no option to create new password. Highly inconvenience. Guess I'll stick to laptop Salesforce."
10,Jon Livingston,"February 17, 2020",3," The latest update improves the layout and design of the app, however I'm encountering an issue with the Maps/Geopointe constantly resetting after going to an account view and then trying to return to the map. It goes back to the default view."
11,Bharath Srinivas,"April 14, 2020",1," Never worked in proper way.. It takes one week if you attach anything important. Useless app. I recommend not to use this. Make use of chrome, it works better. You may ask why top uninstall! You save some space in ROM.."
12,{ Sushonfire },"February 21, 2020",3," Still need quick interfarance, no quick dashboard yet like old sales track where we can easily know today's pending followups and no quick summary of monthly target given which is becoming hard to know what parameters of same month are pending, kindly add above required functions please Reg"
13,Jeffery Pelton,"March 1, 2020",1," Extremely slow on Android S9+. Have to reload and update multiple times. Buggs out in the middle of jobs. Extremely frustrating, was way better 3-4 months ago, a lot more steps involved in simple things. Please fix."
14,Joseph Hutmacher,"February 27, 2020",1, What did you do. Texting from contacts is nearly impossible and the app is slower than snail mail. Switching accounts is more difficult too. Grade of F. A leap backwards.
15,dana nazha,"February 20, 2020",1," Very bad after update, Make our job more difficult instead of easier, Also with the new update we can't delet any tast we don't want, I hope u repair this, and to make it more flexible so we can know direct if we did check in or not... Bad experience"
16,Natnaree Kamonsirinan,"February 11, 2020",1, Not working at all on Android 10. It never gets passed the start page (salesforce logo in the middle of screen) and stays there forever.
17,Alyssa Mercedes Hopun,"February 5, 2020",1," So I login and only get a white screen? Tried reinstalling, same issue. Would really like to be able to use the app, so if there's a fix please let me know."
18,Rosendo R. AKA Ross Cabello,"February 6, 2020",5, Super easy to use. I only dont like it when there's an update cause it won't let me put time other than that enjoy it very much
19,Shep,"February 24, 2020",2," It's slow, user interface is not smooth, logins fail all the time when trying to view my schedule in resources. This app needs a lot of improvements."
20,Samuel Hogan,"March 30, 2020",5," Started using once CoVid hit, great app. Love the ease with which it flows into my other apps like excel, phone and outlook. Keep updating and improving please!"
21,Renegade of Funk,"April 3, 2020",3, Clean app but too many clicks to get from A to B and has a tendency to freeze while scrolling down on pages.
22,Damodara SatyaDeva Madhukar,"April 8, 2020",1," Salesforce is definitely a cheesy CRM Software. But on android, it is not as good it is on Web. The UI is a complete disappointment. Not making it simple..."
23,Mahmoud El Hawary,"February 18, 2020",1, Latest update is awful Removed important features like swiping feature for opportunities and left & right screen swipe to reach notification list You're making the app more difficult to use day after day!
24,akshay maher,"March 25, 2020",3," Awesome app,. But need lot of update..1) Provide desktop view. 2)App Should also work on laptop 3) scrolling should be resumed from were one left instead of scrolling from start."
25,Sangamesh Hadalgi,"March 28, 2020",2, App is good but need to process faster it's to slowly to open and it's taking lot of time.
26,Joshua Flitton,"April 7, 2020",3, Good for all the data it supports but could run smoother and maybe be a little better organized.
27,Bryan Simrak,"February 14, 2020",1, Been out for years and you still can't copy paste. This is once of the most basic things you can possibly expect.
28,Gulam Gauss,"April 1, 2020",1, Worst experience ever too many lags. When we want to use we have to close and open this application so many times. Worst experience.
29,Jesi M,"February 4, 2020",5, Love the App! Lightning is so much better than Classic. Makes entering my activities quick and easy!
30,Jay Tiwari,"April 17, 2020",5, This app is great. But there is one question - can we use Case as a landing page instead of Chatter ?
31,Richard Polachek,"March 6, 2020",4, Helps organize new business prospecting. Some of information seems to be outdated. Still a good prospecting tool.
32,Peter Feng,"March 9, 2020",1, The app doesn't work? New button to create records doesn't work. Can't open records. Using Android.

I have been using this product for 3 years now and was told over a year ago that Einstein voice would be available by now and I still am not granted any access to it. This is my final straw as no one has time to sit on their computer to input notes on accounts. It's ironic that the CEO of Salesforce goes on the record by saying he does no work on an actual laptop but everything on his phone and yet I still don't have access to Einstein Voice. Please Help

Same leads that have full details on Salesforce via browser login. Very rarely has it allowed me to update information on the few leads that populate. Has never allowed me to functionally add a task via Salesforce. App has very few pros. Needs to be updated to reflect existing data in database. UX could be better.

Easy and clear overview at every given moment, which gives the user the ability to effectively manage different accounts in a timely manner. Extremely user friendly on app and the desktop version. However the mobile version is somewhat limited in certain features but still very effective to update opportunities when you're on the road."

After testing out all the features my account has access to, I believe that I am probably only getting a portion of what the app really can do. I can almost guarantee that a few setting adjustments made by my company's administrator would completely change the overall experience of the user and would make the app a tool that all employees would use daily."

82,Philip Mogavero,"December 10, 2019",2," This app just doesn't work, and never really has. I'm running the latest Android OS on a Pixel 2XL. The app opens and I can run a search to find an account, but when I click on an account, it's blank. This happens for every account rendering the app virtually useless to me... Very frustrating!"
83,Tanya Reinhart,"March 17, 2020",5, This is easy to use. Very practical.
84,Daniel Anderson,"December 12, 2019",1, My experience with the Salesforce app for Android is excruciating at the best of times. Nothing works. I dont have access to any of the information I need. It's basically unworkable. Please just go back to the drawing board and redo the Salesforce app.
85,Samuel Labess,"January 28, 2020",1, Completely non-functional. After navigating to any section I cannot scroll or open items. Basically the entire app is unusable.

89,Brian Johnson,"January 23, 2020",4," The app is nice so far, I can access everything I need. Do wish you could filter tasks and checklists by project though, instead of having to sift through them all to find the one in the project you're working on"
90,Springhill SuitesLAX,"December 9, 2019",1," No notification sounds or LED notice as promised. Our work tablet is blazing fast, so it's shocking how slow the app is to refresh or use in general. Much slower than a 15 yr old Windows desktop running Windows XP...."
91,Allyson Reay,"March 29, 2020",3, Seems like there is always a glitch
92,Scott Bates,"February 6, 2020",4, I love the way it helps to reduce my workload by allowing me to enter my calls immediately after completing each one.

236,Joshua Bird,"June 25, 2019",2," Case numbers show up in search, but when you open a case, most of the time it shows up blank. Very rarely loads properly. Closing and then Opening the app does nothing, nor does uninstalling/reinstalling. Very inconvenient."
237,Elliot Fuhr,"October 25, 2019",2," Case view is disorganized. App logs out too quickly. And an extra agent battery hog. Also glitchy: reopening to the login screen hours or days after last usage for no evident reason. For a Marriott app, much work will need to be done before usage in business."
238,Wynna Marie Lugtu,"January 26, 2019",4," This is great when I am unable to get on the computer and update information on SalesForce! If one feature could be added to the Camping World Salesforce where you can convert a lead to an opportunity, much like on a computer, it would be so much better."
239,Brett Findlay,"November 9, 2018",1, Using for time logging and expenses. Horrible experience. Frequently crashes or doesn't load info from web platform. I can't take a picture of receipts to add to expenses. I have to use this for my company and hate every part of it.
240,Pinky Shah,"June 6, 2019",1," the desktop Salesforce crm is so powerful and robust. I don't understand why I cannot do simple things like enter notes in this app. the app is far behind in functionality compared to the mobile. given the price tag, a more sophisticated app is in order."
241,Benny gomez jr,"June 5, 2019",2, this social media interface is absolutely terrible. The layout in general is an eye sore and not so user friendly. please make a cleaner interface and direct straight to the point. straight to my work and or pending work. idc about the social media post or aspect of this.
242,Joe Wiesner,"November 14, 2019",1, Same issue as previous user. Continue to get stuck on passcode on my Galaxy S9. Tried deleting and re installing unsuccessfully.
243,Heather Benzal,"November 6, 2018",4," I really like to be able to access my bookings, new inquiries, customers and accounts when I'm away from the office. However, it is frustrating to not be able to Check Availability. My suggestion would be to add this to the app."
244,Vince Morton,"April 26, 2019",1," app doesn't allow any interaction with a record. if i open a task or contact, no buttons fields or actions are active. can't make a call from their record which is the biggest reason for installing. very frustrating. makes app completely unusable and worthless."
245,Jubz Madagascar,"June 13, 2019",1," Opens up blank most times such that I must force stop and clear data before I can use again. Honestly quite useless, especially if it doesn't give you an error for why this is happening. Otherwise when it works, it's great."
246,Serena Greer,"June 18, 2019",1," The app does not let me view anything. I can search for a customer, but if i select a case, or the account page, or a project I get a blank page with no information. This has made the app completely useless for me."
247,Christina Grimes,"November 11, 2019",5, Easy to use on my smart phone. Sync electronic notes directly into Salesforce. Easy to keep Salesforce notes up to date.
248,Plamen Nikolaev,"April 16, 2020",1, App freezes all of the time and buttons become unclickble
249,Nic Roberto,"November 8, 2018",1," A buggy mess that should never have existed. If you like endlessly diagnosing why the app shows a blank screen, why random error messages appear, why no one can log in, this is the app for you!"
250,Melisa Heredia,"June 21, 2019",1, this app needs a lot of work... there's always an error message coming up in the screen...it crashes quite often too. It's a shame I actually use it a lot to pick up shifts from work and I usually don't have my laptop to do it from there.
251,Robert Carss,"October 25, 2018",3," I use Salesforce for work, the browser version works great and i highly recommend Salesforce as a work management service. THIS APP DOES NOT WORK ON ANDROID DEVICES. The app eats up all of the processing power on my phone and won't load accounts properly."
252,Vlad Kitanoski,"November 14, 2018",2," Horrible App, the majority of it is a link to a website that I can just access through the browser and it even loads quicker through the browser. App keeps logging me out all the time and have to re enter my password"
253,I Y,"June 6, 2019",2," It works very well, and often better than the browser app. However it logs me out so often and everytime I log in I have to grant access permissions and setup calendars. it's a pain"
254,Ryan R,"June 12, 2019",3," Too many bugs. I have to put in a passcode and login 2x just to get logged in despite a ""dont ask me again for 24 hours"" once you use that 1st passcode. It never loads, so I have to constantly uninstall and redownload. Useless."
255,SATYA PRAKASH,"November 13, 2019",2, Suddenly occurred error while journey or event check in. And it takes too much time to complete any task.
256,David Muleza Ng'uni,"February 20, 2020",5, Simply fantastic organising tool
257,Angelo DiNorscia,"January 4, 2019",3," I think it has very useful functions. it would be nice if EVERY address, email address, and each phone number was hot linked on every screen, instead of copy and pasting and manually switching through mobile apps."
258,Tracy Ratcliff,"December 9, 2019",4, Easy to navigate
259,Christopher Wilson,"October 21, 2019",4," Lags at times when searching for customers. You have to type the customer then hit search. Before it used to populate your most popular searches and you could click. Also, lags on uploading pics and says no internet when I have full bar."

261,B P,"June 25, 2019",1," Limited menu customisation or settings. Most importantly, the menu items do show up but once you drill down into say, an account or an opportunity for example, there's no information, just a blank screen??"
262,Olly Bailey,"June 27, 2019",1," It really is so frustratingly bad. Constant white screen, slow when it does load, clunky UI, genuinely my least favorite app that I have to use...which should be so simple! Avoid, if you can."
263,Tony Huynh,"May 17, 2019",1," This app is not very good. Totally differrent user experience than the web version. The mobile app is just frustrating to use - very hard to navigate, can't find what I'm searching for, and just plain difficult."
264,Roman Williams,"June 20, 2019",1," App frequently stops working. More than 50% of the time it takes me to blank white screens. When I uninstall and reinstall the app it works better, but only temporarily"
265,Carly Hanson,"June 25, 2019",1," This app used to work great, but now it wont load on my Moto G6. It opens, but I just see a white screen. Makes it difficult to work! Needs to be fixed asap."

267,Guy Greller,"May 28, 2019",1, the app is not easy to use if you are familiar with the web application. seems like they are using fake AI to predict what i want to use rather giving me the option to choose. almost impossible to go backwards. very poor implementation
268,Enrique Garcia-Allende,"October 16, 2019",2," I have tried it in a Galaxy S8 and a Redmi Note 7, in both of them there is a problem seeing some of the text, words and numbers are on the top of other make it impossible to read. It's not adjusted for the screen size."

273,A Google user,"October 19, 2018",2, The instability of this App is insane. I have to use it for work. How do I update someone of what doesn't work after an update. At this time the upload file part doesn't work.
274,A Google user,"March 5, 2019",1," there should be a exit option to back. otherwise it is going to back for one click of back botton. if once Salesforce going to back, then it is opening after very late process as like reopening."
275,A Google user,"March 31, 2019",2, It is no good if I have to reinstall the app every other day. I have to do this because the app will launch but it won't show the login page; just blank.
276,Emaan Khan,"September 10, 2019",1," Never worked for me. All i see in the app is a the Salesforce logo and nothing happens. If i delete and re install it lets me put in my credentials and then gets stuck on the logo screen again. This is on a fairly new phone also, samsung Note9."
277,Pedro G,"April 10, 2019",2, buggy have to restart phone often. shows old entries instead of selected account. could be my Samsung but using this daily is annoying. I like the company though and will stick with their buggy app. works fine on pc.
278,Nicholas Black,"March 6, 2019",1," I love Salesforce. But, your app for android is absolutely garbage. Every update you put out creates a new issue. Now I can go to an account, but cannot select chatter or relevant to see contacts. Fail."
279,Tom Payne,"June 25, 2019",1, Worst app ever. Records show up as blank pages. I need to uninstall and reinstall to get 5 minutes of use. Would give zero stars if it were an option.

283,James Knapp,"April 18, 2019",3, Overall good. Wish the UI was a bit more streamlined as to increase the amount of content so more can be done in less time.
284,Christopher ehrenberg,"October 13, 2018",1, I have to use this app for work and everytime I do it crashes my Note9. Time for an update to the app since there hasn't been one in almost 3 months.

287,Daniel A.,"October 25, 2018",1, Can't do anything with it. After clicking on an account the interface locks and you can't scroll or switch tabs. Just go back.
288,Jocelyn McCall Ferreira,"October 21, 2019",4," I'm enjoying using Salesforce. The mobile app doesn't give you access to all of the web features such as adding records to notes, but it is still good for managing tasks for example."
289,A Google user,"February 9, 2019",1, Overrated Solution. Lousy user interface. Managements around the world are making a mistake investing in Salesforce. All the data entry is definitely taking time away from sales. Tracking can be done via excel... Way better CRMs out there.
290,Giuseppe Decicco,"February 5, 2019",3, Good App.. although I cannot process quotes tonthe next step. the previous Salesforce app I was able to process all quotes and opportunities. maybe there is a fix for that ?

292,David van Beusekom,"June 27, 2019",3, I had trouble with the search function on my Samsung. I could find records but not access them. Uninstalling and reinstalling the ap has fixed the issue.
293,Michael Ng,"November 27, 2018",4, I have used Salesforce in many organizations however CarMax has it down pat where it's actually useful for the management team and sales reps to drive appointments and activity. The key here is the development of the platform. Especially like the phone interface.
294,Andrew Borja,"November 24, 2018",4, Great app for doing my work anywhere! But this should also have an option within the app to view thru mobile browser. So i can view the entire sf page.
295,Ajeya Bhaskar,"April 5, 2019",1, Highly unsecure app. Impossible to restrict users from downloading confidential documents. Neither Salescloud or Service cloud have any options to restrict download of files from Mobile app only.
296,Robert Rhatican,"February 6, 2019",5," Best app ever! Keeps every bit of information on all clients down to decisions, appointments, and conversations. I'd be behind without it! Love it!"
297,Jim LaFond,"March 26, 2019",1, for my S8 when I open a case it goes to an endless loop and the only way to stop it is to close and force stop the app. March 22 update..reinstalled still crashes when trying to view a case.
298,Ethan Anglea,"March 12, 2019",1, This app is awful it locks up half the time and needs to be closed and opened again and then usually does the same thing. It's unreliable and really just doesn't work well at all
299,Ron Warren,"August 17, 2019",4, At first we couldn't get it on our business domain. Now it works awesomely awesome. Such a better solution than waiting for the AT&T iPad to bless me with a connection.
300,Keith J Alberico,"September 23, 2019",3, Complicated system to use. I like it but need to keep using to really understand it. Have used others that are easier. Wish it spoke to outlook better.

304,Xerryln Gamer,"September 27, 2019",4," Its more easy to input comments and even discusion with the outlets, notes with important discussion can store easily. Daily activity is like calender were you can have daily guide. We can also view all the accounts in one scroll."
305,Anne Nuguid,"October 18, 2018",4," Good app, especially if set up well. Modifying the page layouts and action buttons is not intuitive at all."

331,Bradley Flores,"March 30, 2019",5, very easy way to access your contacts. very easy way to Log a call and keep your CRM updated while on the go.

Why the Android version can't do all the same things as the iOS version does, I couldn't begin to understand. As many others have mentioned, this app takes up so much in the way of resources. It will consistently freeze. No... you can't send in the system log stating what is happening.... because you need to kill the program to get the phone to unfreeze. If the phone doesn't have a full set of bars, and attempt to upload a picture or file, it tells you that you don't have internet connection and then it gives you an error stating that you don't have permission and need to contact system admin. The app only functions in portrait mode. You cannot turn it to landscape. You cannot pan through charts that extend outside of the visible screen. The app needs work. Again, it should mimic the iOS version... but doesn't."

The search feature is so bad I would almost give it no Stars, when looking up a business or contact or company the search feature takes forever and does not give you any indication that it's working... What's worse is if you don't have all bars of signal or if you're not on WiFi a lot of times it just won't work at all. And then there's other times when it brings up search results but when you select one it never populate anything. Now the part that really drives me crazy... I'm using a Galaxy Note 8, my phone has 6 freaking gigs of RAM and this stupid app absolutely locks my phone up if it's running in the background. It's so bad I am continuously begging my senior Executives to get rid of this platform, as well as many others in my company. This app has let me down so many times in the field I've lost count, do not trust it! Print out all your information before you leave the office!"

can view account details, any associated contacts, and any cases tied to

2309,Charles Curtis,"April 15, 2018",1, This version is sad. I used Salesforce classic everyday. Now I barely ever open this because it's totally useless. I can't even review a full month of accounts like I used to with Salesforce classic. Total rubbish. Probably won't use it much anymore
2310,Bud Geissler,"June 21, 2018",1," This app is terrible and is inconsistent in it's functionality. I need to 
depend on it. It loads randomly, it signs me out, sends me passwords three 
or four times in a row and is basically useless, because I can't depend on 
it allowing me to access the information"
2311,Jonny Edser,"April 28, 2018",4," I love Salesforce on my laptop but I am less keen on the app. It gives me

2317,Sai Ram,"April 30, 2018",4," I like the desktop version more. It's user-friendly. Mobile app is good, 
but it can be made less complex. Also, is there a way to keep a reminder 
for notes? I'm in the early days of exploring the app, hence don't know."
2318,Stephen Clissold,"June 25, 2018",4," Great app just like the platform. Some limitations on the mobile app

course."

2322,T Payne,"July 10, 2018",3," The app is useful but could use some upgrades. One useful upgrade would be 
to add a check list of all new accounts so you don't walk in to an account 
that another co worker walked in to a month ago from same company but 
different location. This feature would be helpful."

Don't get me started on it not rotating so I can type and see the screen in the same orientation."
2498,AMANDA Plahuta,"December 8, 2017",3, Overall the app is great how ever it does  not work optimally  on a galaxy . I have difficulty getting my map to load frequently
2499,taylor richardson,"December 13, 2017",4, I am new to the app and am finding it useful. One suggestion I have is adding the ability to locate yourself on a map in relation to accounts near you. As a new salesmen this would be helpful to locate customers easily.
2500,Sojourn Breneiser,"January 18, 2018",2, Stalls and freezes periodically.  Not able to scoll easily.  Use desktop version to do mobile work.

2503,XxDeathcorpzxX,"January 6, 2018",1," Very Disappointing.  I have struggled to view issued policies, campgaigns, etc from this app because it doesnt show any until I discovered it will only show ONCE you viewd it from their salesforce website. Fix this."

2515,Rajesh Gosain,"December 7, 2017",1, Very poor. Can't do much more than view stuff and chat. Not something I expected from Salesforce.

The previous version would not open the Output Document PDF attachments, this one is not much better because it opens to a totally black page. I keep persevering but I am losing hope for this app. The network I am connected to is fast and reliable, this is an issue with Salesforce - do not send me the standard reply ""Salesforce1 is a complex app and needs a decent internet connection to function well"" - I can open the document if I use full Salesforce on the same device but that is fiddly given the small screen."
2619,Drago Bagaric,"November 29, 2017",1, Absolute rubbish. Crashes all the time. SF have removed the call log function that used to allow you to call external on your mobile and log the call on SF but this function has been removed.

I would like simple functions such as landscape view when phoned turned, and sometimes the back button goes too far....but all in all, it is a great tool for our sales team that is driving user adoption of Salesforce upwards! Keep checking for updates though...  I have noticed people seem to be complaining about some issues that I think can be sorted by your admin or developer. Take the SF Trailhead for basic customisation, I'm sure half the issues can be sorted 😊"
2621,Sebastian Alcaraz,"November 8, 2017",2, It's disappointing how unstable the app is. Interface design is very basic but navigation and loading is not smooth. Not user-friendly at all.
2622,Israel Holby,"November 9, 2017",1," This app is really garbage and indicative of the decline of Salesforce. Slow, unreliable and only getting worse. Restarts when I search for an opportunity. Provides blank screens instead of data. Impossible to add a contact role, so can't email follow up."
2623,Krishna Sharma,"November 14, 2017",1, Chatter option is disabled for me as a user by the admin. As a result I am not able to login. I think we should be able to login even if we don't want to chat.

It would be nice to be able to select a different dialer for calls placed from within the app.  It defaults to the default dialer but I would like for it to be able to be set to Ring Central so we can have our call recording enabled and use my company number for placing calls without the hassle of copy and pasting the number."

I manage my funnels and next step processes. This seems to work great on tablets but not so well on a smartphone. I have been experiencing problems not having an entire page displayed , still having Hang-Ups, and at times seems to take more clicks to do a process than needs to be. I'd like to thank the Developers, once the above have been addressed I will change my rating and gladly promote the app."

There's no way to read the full case comments.  Seems like this is a very basic function that should just work.  Update3: Still Bad.  This app has never worked properly.  I don't think they do any actual testing before releasing it.  It can not be relied on for any critical information when you need it.  You can't even view an address because this app is so incredibly buggy.  Edit 2:  even after the latest update this is still the worst Android app.  Instead of fixing the Map button, they simply removed it.  If you use Android devices you should try to convince your company to change CRMs."
2888,Kiran Naik,"April 7, 2017",1," Too many issues with this app. Expected better application from salesforce. It's a mammoth task to close the app at times, keeps restarting and popping up continually"
2889,Christopher Kain,"June 20, 2017",2, We use this at our business. It's pretty much useless as a mobile app. Can't access calenders. That's annoys g when I'm meeting a client. We shouldn't have spent the money on this. Salesforce doesn't work.

The browser site is unusably slow even with a fast connection. Salesforce is unusable on an android tablet which is shameful for a company your size. Give one dev one day to work on it and it should be done.
3037,Nate Purscelley,"March 25, 2017",2," I upgraded my phone because Salesforce 1 ran so horribly on it. Well, new phone, same poor performance.  Half the time I try to load a record the screen stays blank. Sometimes a reboot works, sometimes not. Not good when I'm in the field and need quick info."
3038,NS Bedford2,"March 6, 2017",1," Ever since Salesforce  upgrade, it will no longer work on my android tablet or phone.   I can get in, but my desktop will not finish loading.  I am getting no help from any source.  I have tried uninstalling then reinstalling.  No change in status.  Cannot recommend if I cannot use."
3039,Bryan Guidizi,"March 19, 2017",1, Our organization switched to Salesforce and this app for a field force management solution. This is the worst UI and also not suited to our needs. UI issues and lack of functionality are Salesforce issues. I blame our organization for selecting this as our solution.
3040,Simon Tye,"March 29, 2017",3, Pretty good app. Put in one lead though and it keeps going to a black screen. Had to restart app each time I touched a hyperlink in order to keep working.
3041,L Dude,"March 16, 2017",4," Overall, this app is a useful tool. Personally, I dont like adding new opportunities from the app. It's much harder to navigate. I open chrome and use the full site."
3042,A Google user,"March 12, 2017",3," The update has changed the dashboards to a new modern look, but I no longer see values that I need, for example doughnut shows total but not segment values, so becomes useless."
3043,Andres Bustos,"March 7, 2017",3, It's OK to search for information or make small modifications to records but due to its low speed and interface I use it only when I don't have access to my laptop.
3044,Peter Lindström,"March 7, 2017",1, Displays only one screen of information e.g. doesn't let you scroll. None of the bottom buttons work.

3050,Bill Kammerer,"March 30, 2017",4," Very helpful app when out in the field with mobile device and interacting with clients and accounts. Improvements I would like to see would be a landscape mode on mobile devices and the ability to attach files from mobile devices, Google Drive and other popular file repositories."
3051,Carlos A. Temperan,"March 5, 2017",3, Amazing program with the biggest downside to the login in steps. If you have a special domain you have too many steps to log in. Please make this a click and log in like other programs and you will get your well deserved 5 star.
3052,Steve Neil,"March 23, 2017",4, Please please please unlock the reminder/notification beta I've read about on every forum! It's the only thing holding SF1 back!
3053,Brian Rankin,"March 22, 2017",3, Contents will load maybe 50% of the time regardless of data connection. It happens over lte or wifi at home (Google fiber 1000mbps) but the desktop site works well enough.

3094,Christopher Collier,"February 18, 2017",3," Has a long way to go. Not enough control over side menu items (difficult to get to your custom objects).

3095,Travel with Tu,"January 11, 2017",1,Worst... Ever. Worst app ever! The app continuously shuts down. And when it's not shutting down it doesn't allow me to add contacts or quickly get to meetings or quickly find meetings.

Without the ability to view whole comments from clients or technicians or even post an external comment this app adds no value to the software.

For the amount of money we pay to use the salesforce you would think they could get it to work correctly. At this point I have to delete and reinstall the program once or twice a week. It freezes and tells me we are stuck in a loop. It has caused more frustration than I could have ever imagined. At this point I would say run and run far away. They are going to charge for any little change and it most likely will fail to work correctly.

3576,Jim Sea,"May 18, 2016",4,Works well! Very happy having mobile access. Two things to change to move to 5 stars: 1) Being able to rotate my screen to landscape when viewing reports. 2) A little faster when loading big pages. Both of those are nuisances and don't have a significant impact on my productivity.
3577,Michael Keselman,"May 20, 2016",4,"SLOWWWW Far from perfect. It's so very useful to have it on the go. Hence the four stars. But it's so slow across any device I've tried. Also, a browser view would be nice. By that, I mean switching the app to look like it does on a PC browser."
3578,Christian Rubach,"May 25, 2016",3,Sub-par chatter mobile Chatter mobile support continues to be sub-par. Hard to navigate/search/organize and filter relevant posts with many groups in a large organization. Tagging does not work consistently and it is near impossible to filter re-posts etc.

Things don't load and it is super slow to the point where you wonder if the app is frozen or crashing. How a big company could release such a bad app, I'm not sure. The replies to the reviews here aren't much reassurance that it is actually getting any better. Makes me wonder if the 5 star reviews are fake because no person who actually uses this app could rate it higher than 1 star."
3582,David Charest,"June 11, 2016",1,"How is this considered a support app? Something as simple as viewing case comments doesn't work? Really? Reading updates that customers put into a trouble ticket is not worth being able to read apparently. Oh, and swiping said unreadable comments has a pretty movement, but no functionality. It's like they want you to hate them!"
3583,Remington Rawlings,"April 26, 2016",5,Business as usual I think it's good to have a handy tool like Salesforce on the go with me wherever I am at. This doesn't have all the functionality of the Web version as a mobile app but I have been in need of this at multiple times.

When you try opening the App the error message 'This change isn't allowed by your administrator' keeps popping up and you cannot progress with the setup.

Anything required to do actual work isn't available, so what's the point? Furthermore it's slow and terribly awkward to use, I'm not sure who would find this useful. The sad part is that I don't think it would be hard to offer well rounded app that mirrors what the site does.

I find this app is useful for nobody in sales, whether your a salesperson, marketing person, or sales manager.  It looks like a significant amount of development time was spent on it, but it is all but completely useless.   To do tasks that a salesperson typically needs to do, like make a block of calls, enter in tasks, look up customers, often requires going through multiple menus and screens. You can't even click on an email link in a report and have it go to email.   It used to be that the web version at least went to a Salesforce Classic like interface, not it goes to a Salesforce1 interface.  For the amount of time it takes to work with the product, they should call it Salesforce sub-zero.   You will never be successful in sales if you rely solely on this app to be productive in your accounts. You're much better off using Excel or pen and paper than this bloated piece of junk. There must be a bunch of ""Yes-men"" in SFDC product development, none of them which have sold before.   I was going to write more, but I ran out of space."

One can call through the app fine, but it takes FOREVER to log a call once the call is done. This is an essential part of my performance contract and I'm limited to doing it on a desktop at work.

It's difficult to perform more complex functions in the app, at least for our instance. We use a lot of custom functionality for the service cloud and as the SFDC administrator, I need to be able to easily view various fields on a page as well as related lists and on the app it takes a long time to load and scroll through it with this format. Again, it's OK though and I'm happy to have it."

I was expecting my remote field reps to be able to do their tasks easily and efficiently. But that is not the case.  There's no mobile page layout view. It's all or nothing. That's OK if you just use mobile or just use the full app. But if you use both, you get the one layout.  Rearranging the fields to put the mobile fields at the top is not a feasible solution.  Can't reassign ownership of a record (could probably do in code, perhaps with workflows,  but not with configuration).  Can't change Record types (could probably do in code, perhaps with workflows,  but not with configuration).  Can't view Matrix reports  Publisher Actions are limited to only what you currently have access/rights to. If you don't use ""Master"" record types, this is a pain. Could probably do in code, perhaps with workflows,  but not with configuration. And since you can't select a Record Type you must default to one, and then use other means to modify.  There is some good. You can *VIEW* items and records and the Compact Record Layout is helpful. But you can't *DO* much unless you own the record and just want to update data within that record."

Need a font size setting. 2) When using the Android back key, it's easy to back all of the way out of the app.  Please add an exit confirmation prompt. 3) The detail page heading wastes a lot of vertical space. The object icon should never wrap to it's own line.  A lot less padding should be used. 4) The publisher action pages use blue buttons with a small font on a blue background.  Usability is poor.  The buttons should be styled the same as the action buttons on the detail pages for consistency and usability. 5) I wrote a Visualforce page that let's me take a picture then save it as a file attachment to a custom object (I don't want to use the built-in Salesforce1 function that adds a photo as a Chatter feed).

I think Salesforce is a good program, but feel that the developers are blinded at what is important.  Is it easy for the customers to use.  Isn't it the job for the developers to conform to the customer? Not the customer conform to the developer?  The system likes to lock up quite often and wastes time out in the field.  Not good for being on the go.  The events are very important to stay on task.  Why do we have to dig through the application in order to get to it?  Seriously?  What kind of product research did Salesforce do on this one?  Can these developers think for once as a sales individual on the go?  I would call tech support, but with events in the past, I will get a phone call at 2am when I'm in bed or 10am when I'm with a customer.  I'm sure they will come up with something crazy like reformat my phone in order to start working properly.  In conclusion... This new app was promised to be something great, but it is still way too clunky.  Quite a bit of performance issues.  And finally, not something well researched for the user. I use Google Nexus 4, so I do have the latest Android software 4.4.2"

I work in a big company that is  using you CRM system  and I am 100% sure that no one will change phones of the employees to make them use this app. And this can be bad for user in general but also for your company as instead of making this app popular you will only limit it to a certain number of individuals."

The opportunities pages take minutes to load, the Google map function three out of five times sends you to the wrong address. Once the page does load for an opportunity it loads only a small section at a time and then rarely syncs the rest of the page if you have anything less than a perfect 4G data connection. If it weren't for my job requiring us to use it I would delete this and not think twice"
5014,Ray Trevino,"September 18, 2014",1,This app is horrible! I've had to use Salesforce Classic to gain more info on my accounts. NOT user friendly at all and there are other apps that allow more interaction than this one.  It's unfortunate that our company spends so much for technology and ends up with this. Thanks for the backup of Classic.
5015,Kunal Vankani,"April 24, 2020",2, Amazing app lot of options but the worst part it doesn't opens up no matter it's a new cell phone or old the software lags like hell. This app can raise the digital productivity to its highest peak it has the potential but it has to be lag free first.
5016,Steven Corbo,"December 2, 2014",1,Didn't  like it It was cumbersome  to get to an account i don't want chatter on my phone and it doesn't  allow me to log my calls. It just takes up valuable memory.

Are these technical issues based on android version or it depends on device model and android version both?
5018,Anthony Spencer,"October 23, 2014",2,App requires too much private information This app has the ability to see and track call logs; make phone calls; find accounts on the device; use the accounts; delete the accounts; change passwords on the accounts.  This is a little too much access for my taste. Otherwise the app itself is good.
5019,Steve S,"July 6, 2015",1,Frustrating App works fine while on a Wi-Fi connection which defeats the purpose.  App stalls and does not perform well at all while in the field to say the least.  Handheld contact for Act CRM blows salesforce out of the water.  Major disappointment

I'm not able to access any Case Views at all, custom or otherwise (they might be present, but invisible). My Cases tab is a list of blank buttons. I can tap them, and open the Cases; but none of the Case details are populating on the buttons, so I can't see what case I'm going to open. The view seems to be the default ""Recent Cases"" view, with a reverse chronological sort.   I am able to access and post to Feeds; but Feeds are nearly useless for my workflow. I need case Views and/or Reports to do my job.  On that note, I literally never want to see the Feed when I open a Case, only the Details. If there's an option to change this default setting, I didn't find it; if there isn't one, there really should be. I sometimes post to individual Case Feeds after doing some work on them; but I do all my Feed reading in the Chatter Tab.  I'm also unable to view a number of objects attached to Cases, but they might all be custom Objects (and if so I understand if that places them outside the intended scope of this app).   I suspect it's a handset compatibility issue; a friend's handset's Case Tab works. Not sure of the other Obje"
