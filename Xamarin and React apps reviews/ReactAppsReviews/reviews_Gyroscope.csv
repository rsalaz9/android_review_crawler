But my main complaint is that you're paying $99/ month for intensive nutrition counseling from a coach and the engagement just isn't there. I was expecting daily check-ins and sometimes I don't hear from my coach in a week. For that level of engagement I could pay less for Noon.

Their website doesn't explain any of this. Once I finally recovered my account it says you have to pay $10 a month to do anything. Not going to pay because it shows you nothing about what you will actually get out of the app. This app was somewhat decent several years ago, now it is a waste of time."

The app looks great, and often performs ok. However, when there is an update I begin having issues w/ place tracking and auto synching. Moreover, I've reached out to the developers about my issues and they are not returning my messages. Most issues would be straightened out via proper user manual/videos, but it looks like the focus has changed to further monetization. I was a real evangelist for this app. But between a clunky UI/UX and my other issues I have reduced my rating."

5,Brendan Coughlan,"December 16, 2019",2, There is no free trial period as promised. I was charged and not given a refund even after asking them. It does have a lot of potential though if they implement what they are trying to advertising
6,Joey Cuddington,"December 23, 2019",4, Immersive and interactive component add-ons!! You can even print out a book with a paid subscription
7,Vikas Vadlapatla,"December 31, 2019",3, It's too expensive for my activities (or the lack of). A free aggregator like Google Fit works for me

Pros: + Good UX with intriguing visuals + Mostly brings all of your health stats into one place + Mood tracking was useful  Cons: - Not enough integrations. One sleep tracker, one scale, one music app, no diet apps. - Integrations it does have are incomplete. Garmin only gets steps (incorrectly) but not workouts or sleep.  - For a small company, they don't respond to customer service at all.  I really wanted this to be what it promises. At some point it might be, but right now this app just doesn't come close enough to its aspirations."

Sleep data wildly inaccurate, places this is the part that pisses me off the most. Does the app even use my GPS. Works fine with everything else. Not gryochoke. Travel maps look drawn by a 3rd grader and an Etch a sketch. Places have me 4 miles away when I'm sleeping in bed. If this app was $5 I'd still be pissed. Developers should be ashamed. IPhone only app. No android"
12,Jeevan Naika,"March 26, 2020",1," Too costly for nothing.. On iPhone its bit fine, for Android it sucks.. Too costly pricing.. With this price I can get a netflix 😅"

These are mostly thinga that have been done intentionally! There is no back/undo option when doing the mood tracking. This is less than 5 minutes of using the app."
15,A Google user,"March 31, 2019",3," It looks promising but it's actually not very useful. It collects some data from some apps, but not all data. So you may need to connect several apps or input data manually. It doesn't connect with Wear OS smartwatches! Pro version ia stupidly expensive - not unlike most apps of this kind."
16,Jakub Jelen,"November 15, 2018",3," Good visualization of the day-to-day activities. But in recent versions unbearably slow. Most of the time I watch the spinner loading something, usually outdated."
17,Ros Po,"June 12, 2019",2, The app looks nice. A friend recommended it me unfortunately they have an iPhone so they had features the the Android version doesn't. You can't track blood pressure in the Android version. Many of the features require an iPhone.
18,Paul Murphy,"March 1, 2019",1, the app is a mess its difficult to get to grips with the information because its all over the place. it also gives notifications to tell me that ive turned off notifications... too much going on and not useful enough. its also too slow to import data...
19,Shaheena Attarwala,"January 9, 2019",1," in the midst of all the privacy concerns going on I am unclear why it's asking for so many access. e.g. my friends list, fb photos? unless a use case specifically asks for it an option to not provide is hidden I inside. I'm out for privacy concerns. otherwise seems fine."
20,Ryan Theodosia Zentmyer,"February 15, 2019",3," the tools offered are nice when they work, but recently any attempt to edit my Places timeline has caused the app to crash. it's quite frustrating to see that i have unidentified places but being physically unable to identify them"
21,Matt Baker,"April 13, 2019",2," doesn't accurately track anything. I'm convinced all the good reviews are from developers or people invested in the success of this app. it looks like it has the potential to be really good, but sadly it isn't"
22,Matt Hall,"September 17, 2018",2," Seems to be mainly for iOS, as there are lots of bugs and when I contacted the devs they suggested it works well with Apple! Good job I didn't spend any money on this before finding that out."
23,Dan Collins,"March 16, 2019",2," This app could be great, but the location features just don't work. The very slow support doesn't really care and told me it would work on iPhone instead. Don't pay until they fix it."
24,Nathan Davies,"May 11, 2019",2, A good idea but poor execution. Steps only sync about once a month from Google making me look lazy. Mood tracking is the only thing that works well and support is non responsive.
25,Simon Slamka,"June 5, 2019",4," Awesome app, but after saving sleep from the Sleep AI, there is no way to edit it. I really would like to see this to be possible!  Thanks"
26,Mitchell Riggan,"May 5, 2019",4," Everything works well and its very integrated but most british don't measure in Kilograms but we measure in Stones and pounds, would be good to have the option to pick individual units (14 lbs = 1st)"
27,IV IVII XX,"April 24, 2019",1, This app doesn't track my location without me having to open the app. Sometimes my location is not working properly even when I open the app.
28,Andy Clark,"January 31, 2019",2," It's Cool, but it doesn't work. Cool idea and wallpaper for the startup screen though."
29,R Q,"March 20, 2019",3, Does not sync workouts from Fitbit. The only option is to manually input which there is 0% I sill bother to do consistently

34,Chris Sansbury,"September 28, 2019",1, More hidden behind a (very expensive) paywall than the iOS version. Sneaky.
35,Abraham Sanchez,"September 28, 2018",5," Pretty great, i want more features like tracking finances for a one stop shop review of my life."
36,A Google user,"November 8, 2018",2," Just another application written with a terrible cross platform UI, delivering a disastrous UX."
37,Teguh,"October 30, 2018",2," An overpriced hub app, best for people who want health reports in style. I better go for cheaper alternative."
38,Pablo Rotondo,"July 8, 2019",2, Nice app but it drains too much battery.

53,Jesse Logue,"December 10, 2019",1, It's an awesome iPhone app and thats 90 percent of their focus. The android version is super buggy and they are trying to charge way to much. I could maybe see the price justified for the iPhone version but not for this subpar version.

It will generally pick up a lot of the places you've been, but usually fails at adding in movements (walk, car, bus, scooter etc). Quite disappointing regarding this and I hope the developers improve it soon. However, this app is doing greater in other areas. I think integration is probably the big thing with this app. Works with most fitness trackers, so no issue if you change."
55,Filipe Ataíde,"December 10, 2019",5, Gyroscope is an impressive app that integrates different services that relate with health and work activities. Keep up the great work guys. It is a pleasure to be part of beta :)

The look and feel is pretty awesome and is great to track all the activities in one place but is definitely not worth spending money. Majority features are behind the paywall. Also the rescue time integration data is very hard to find on the website. Needs better ways to add manual data (now that Runkeeper is a pro feature) like a widget.  Places: Needs better ways to correct wrong data tracked due to GPS misbehaviour. No way to correct kms between locations
64,Kapil Dalwani,"September 9, 2018",3, Great iOS support but lacking Android support. Awesome UI and great potential. But far from a polished product.

Today I went on a 10 mile hike. At the peak I had a mobile signal. There was no option or detection of adding a place or visit. Interface is clunky even with pro version. I even uploaded the hike to 3 different sources, strava, garmin, and google fit. Yet, despite it saying connected to source, fails to sync and show my hike on Gyroscope. In addition, it shorted me on steps by about 5,000. This app has no practicality for me without seamless syncing, perhaps it's better on iphone? But for android its unusable. I cancelled the subscription after the 1st day."
69,Michael Yonka,"August 24, 2018",1, This app has not tracked a single location since Tuesday 8/21. Before then it was an acceptable app. Although it is not comparable to life cycle!

For this category of the app, some very important features and functionality is missing such as custom moods and mood notes/diary, calories & food tracking, custom goals. For its price, it also should have much more integrations, e.g. MyFitnessPal, Headspace, Todoist, etc."
96,Ross Wightman,"March 6, 2018",2, Looks slick at first. But functionality is lacking. Layout is buggy. I can't figure out how to change units. Google Fit sync is lost daily. Questionable add on value over the sources it tries to integrate
97,Grant Willig,"March 5, 2018",3, Not well fleshed out for Android and extremely limited app integrations.
98,A Google user,"April 9, 2018",2, I've had the app for less than a day. It lost its connection to Google fit twice in that brief time period. Looks like a good concept poorly executed.
99,Jeff G,"April 7, 2018",2, Layout looks good but totally unusable in a scaled user display settings. UX can be improved as well.

The graphs and calorie calculations are kind of funny (yay four hours of cycling lets me eat a whole pizza! Or about two packs of cookies).  Coming to the down sides, not many people I know use it. There's no way to add people who're already using it. So basically all I see is my own cards, with little to no social encouragement.  The monthly price is just way too high. There are some apps with yearly subscriptions for the same price as this one's monthly.  Sleep tracking is absolutely inaccurate."

Thought I love ithe app it's clearly built by Apple developers for an Apple audience (Apple people just love paying tons for gadgets). The monthly fee is exhorbitant considering the lack of integration for key products like: Sleep as Android, Google Fit (extremely limited - just steps, it really needs to pull heart rates, weights, meditations and everything else being stored) and then if you'd really like to live a little you'd consider integrating with massive brands like MiBand and Xiaomi and don't forget Samsung Health. lastly it'd be cool to at the veyr least be able to upload csv data for products like MiBand heart rates so we can upload the by the minute data as opposed to manually capturing it. Great product but lacks Android vision or understanding. All the integrations are disapointing and the MOVES app doesnt work at all. PS: consider integration to MOOV and Hydro Coach."

218,Derick Rethans,"May 13, 2018",1," A bit pointless as it doesn't integrate with either RunKeeper or Samsung 
Health"
219,Lyfe,"December 9, 2017",1, Useless app. Just takes info from other health apps you have.
220,Brad Westbrook,"December 1, 2017",5," No Shealth integration. I have a s7 edge and a gear s3 frontier, s-health is my only option, but I won't rate you down for that."
221,Mick Brookes,"December 3, 2017",1, Tried to use email to no avail.  If you don't use Facebook you can't log on despite what they say.

225,Rick Morar,"December 22, 2017",1," Keeps on hanging, useless"
226,Andy Tran,"August 21, 2018",2, Integration with Samsung health? What can this do that Google hasn't done?
