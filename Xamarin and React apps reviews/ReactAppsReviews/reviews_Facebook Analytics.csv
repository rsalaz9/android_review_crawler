Reports interface is frustrating, but it's easy enough to create a simple report on the fly. The performance can be slow, and the 90-day history limit makes the app useless for anything other than performance monitoring. Don't expect many actionable insights from this app beyond your current campaign performance. There are no page insights or event values available, so you'll still need to visit the Pages Manager and Google Analytics apps for the full story."
