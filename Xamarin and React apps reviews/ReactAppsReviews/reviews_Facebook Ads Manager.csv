No consideration on UX whatsoever. Hands down the worst app in the entire Play Store. You just cannot fathom how bad it is. It says my account disabled without telling why it is disabled, or notification that is was disabled. Ads campaign run and stop by itself. My campaign pending review is like a game of chance without clear guidelines on what was being considered. I only promote my IG landscape photos while they do not take down abusive racist content on the platform."

Its difficult to create multiple ad sets in one campaign and duplicate ads into a new ad set or campaign. It's not clear (or even possible from what I can tell) to turn off detailed ad targeting expansion. There are many features missing that are pretty essential to using ad manager and makes this app frustrating if not worthless to use. The app also crashes A LOT.

Just as important, the ads data is not consistent across the app and desktop, and the design, although elegant and mobile friendly, is different enough that it's not easy to compare core KPI's across Campaigns and Ad Sets. Really all I care about is knowing traffic metrics, how many conversions, conversion value, and how much I spent. Show me this in one bit size dashboard without having to click through different levels and scrolling so much, and I'll happily change my rating. It's not so much about using preset dashboards or making the app work for me-- it's about accessing the most important information quickly and knowing it's accurate so I don't need to look at my computer."

243,Tank JoyRide,"April 5, 2019",3," its okay. however the inability to manage your ad itself, like your targeting, budget or your optimizations, makes it a bit hard to manage your ad on the go like they say. all you can really do is create campaigna or activate or deactivate campaigns. which isn't really helpful."

245,IamMrSpac3ly420,"February 4, 2019",2, I think it's a pretty good app to help create an ad or boost you profile but there are some glitches when changing cover photo.

247,Wesley Carrington,"May 30, 2019",1," Terrible, choppy, complicated, lacking in performance. This app boasts a lot and has major potential.

248,Oscar Mata,"September 17, 2018",5," This app is great for me to keep an eye on my Ads when I'm away from my computer. If I see an Ad is not performing well, I simply shot it off and fix it when I get home."

250,Alex L,"July 22, 2019",2, This app is pretty broken. When you try to create new audiences for boosting a post you get stuck. You can't continue or go back without discarding post or save as draft? Boosting post directly through the original facebook app or on the conputer is WAY easier then this app.
251,AKSHAY KUMAR,"October 12, 2018",4, App is good to track all FB ads at one place...but I want to know how can duplicate ad sets into this app...please help me on this...or how to create a new ad sets into this app... currently app is getting crashes so please fix as soon as possible

253,Nckk pr,"September 8, 2019",1," Seriously whats is the use of such apps if you can't edit campaigns, ads and add amount... Its just a Storage blocking apps of no practical use.

254,Brian Olek,"December 10, 2018",1," Seriously disappointing how often the app crashes on Android. It's incredibly unstable. We're trying to pay Facebook money to run ads, and their platform crashes so often that often we just abandon ads."
255,Bernice Hiebert,"May 9, 2019",1, I can't seem to get this app to stay open. It comes on for 1 second then covers up with a white sheet. I have emailed the developer 3 times and got no reply. I called Facebook and left a message and still no call back

261,Nilotpal Das,"June 26, 2019",3," this app does not allow us to create ads or adsets under existing campigns which can be done only using a pc. so the only use of this app is to track ad spendings and results on existing campaigns. whenever i try to create an ad, it creates a new campaign"
262,Tabata,"August 7, 2019",1," It seems that this ad has been hacked. There's always a glitch and it is not linking onto my facebook's ad page. It always shows a blank page which is frustrating. Because of that, I am blindly giving out money for this ridiculous Advert."

265,Leo Doan,"December 31, 2018",1," It used to let me delete ads but recent updates removed that option. Also, sometime when I extend the period the date would randomly change which caused the $ per day to bi much higher. I lost $400 in 2 days for that reason. Very annoying."
266,mesfin hailemariam,"August 13, 2019",2," It is getting better when it comes to simplicity while approaching level of the desktop version of ads manager but there are minor glitches.

267,Nirah D,"October 24, 2019",1, This app can only be used to review currently active ads. All though it suggests creation is available. The app is constantly glitching when adding the audience. Due to the new audience guidelines the app will not accept any audience added via the app.

Which kind of defeats the convenience of it, but if you need to make changes on the go, good app."
2092,A Google user,"August 27, 2017",1, Keeps crashing every time I open it.   Setting the default lifetime spend to $350 is a scam - be careful as the app is so buggy that it sometimes reverts to the default charging you an excessive amount - have just got stung with a $330 bill.

Would you guys please fix the case and release a new version.   Meanwhile I have a strong feeling that Facebook Adds will soon take the place of Google Adds. Main reason is that people need to improve their site which it is not so much required on Facebook.   On Facebook, just make your adds attractive then you ready to sell anything with a low cost. On Google people have to do Backlinks which are rubbish. It is like tons of plastic on the sea. Dirty and difficult to clean."
