0,Hayder Sinan,"April 24, 2020",3, There's no ability to share anything from another app to it. Also video can't be played directly. And the list of users I have chatted with disappear I have to search for the User again to write to him
1,Divyanshu Agrawal,"February 2, 2020",5," One of the best tools for collaboration! The dark mode is neat and I like the idea of topic based communication. Ability to integrate with bots/services easily is great, too! Plus, it's open source!"
2,Kane Chang,"December 26, 2019",1," I was using the legacy version. But two days ago it cannot work anymore. For this version of Zulip, I cannot connect to my organization's server. Completely dead...."
3,Lucas Durand,"January 20, 2020",2," Sometimes messages come in. Other times I'm ""offline"" and get an email. Those messages often never arrive in the app."
4,Deb Deep Sett,"November 23, 2019",4, Please fix issues with opening pdf files. Sometimes it wont open them at all
5,Larry Singa,"April 26, 2019",2," I can only use the mobile app to receive notifications, but not to work with. It's too time-consuming to search/jump between different chats, and many search queries are not supported. It would be nice to have the same search capacity as in the web app."
6,Jarett Poole,"September 25, 2019",3," The biggest thing this app needs is a left panel, like the desktop client. Navigation is simply too clumsy and time-consuming. I really love this platform but the mobile app is just not easy to use and is keeping me from implementing this at my organization."
7,ashlae blume,"February 18, 2020",3," Great on desktop, buggy on phone. Needs more feature control."
8,Rombout Versluijs,"April 25, 2019",3, the app is simple and works nice. how ever when your comment is longer than your screen you cant scroll down and your basically typing blind until it appears on screen. rotating the phone does give an option to clean done.that should show in portrait mode aswell
9,Andrew Johnson,"September 20, 2019",2," Can't rely on notifications. Doesn't switch to relevant account when opening notification, opens last used account. Without reliable notifications its very stressful and time consuming to cycle through accounts to check for new messages."
10,David S.,"April 20, 2019",1, So buggy; it is completely unuseable. Sends messages twice or not at all. Doesn't load new messages. Incomplete user and stream list. The list goes on and on.
11,Michael The Awesome,"November 28, 2018",1," This app is more indicative of a react native demo than a professionally made application. In terms of settings, why can't I access the same advanced settings as the browser(or even normal ones, I want to change my profile picture)?

In terms of settings, why can't I access the same advanced settings as the browser(or even normal ones, I want to change my profile picture)? Why am I allowed, as a user, to access the app's environment variables? It took me five minutes to actually find my name to @, because there's no current user summary. Why isn't the subscribed panel selected by default? Discord, Slack, Telegram, and Gitter's mobile apps are much better than this."
12,Mike,"November 17, 2019",1, When I try to open Zulip all get is a white blank screen.... Real shame!
13,Wyatt Hoodes,"June 11, 2019",5," Awesome and open source! If one were to run into any problems, the community is very responsive and fast-acting."
14,Alexey Barinov,"October 15, 2019",3," Cannot use external communication device (3g modem) to install app via smart installer. installed app which is set to start with Windows, does not normally work until app restart having internet connection active"
15,Ethan Roush,"October 24, 2019",2, The UI is a tad hideous and navigation is a bit of a pain. My biggest complaint is that you NEVER get notifications for any messages.
16,Sumanth Rao,"December 17, 2018",5, Easy to use platform. Helps manage clutter of messages received with ease. An awesome product! üëå
17,Dawid W,"June 24, 2019",2, Quite buggy. Sometimes new messages don't load and even restarting the app doesn't help.
18,Critical Mass,"November 27, 2019",3," It is useful, but crashes often."
19,Alexander Lunev,"July 11, 2019",5," Exactly what I need for projects concerning streams and topics, and ability to move messages from one topic to another"
20,Dan Farrell,"February 21, 2019",1," i can never find new messages in this app, even after notification that they arrived. for me, this app is effectively nonfunctional."
21,Aaron Lease,"November 7, 2018",4," I like it so far - nice that you can host a Zulip yourself as well üëç Will Zulip be getting 2FA any time soon, or is it already there and I missed it?"
22,HamidReza Molaei,"May 20, 2019",2," right to left languages not supported yet,"
23,Chris Georgen,"October 21, 2019",5," Not sure what the negative reviews are referencing. Our company has been using Zulip for months now, and it's great!"
24,LongBoarder Anonymous,"April 15, 2020",3, What about invites from this App?
25,Sandy Bucket,"April 10, 2019",5, thank you for all the great ux!
26,Michael Potter,"February 27, 2019",3, no way to really edit profile in app
27,Pea Nguyen,"September 17, 2019",2, Bad user experience

29,Alexander vT,"August 30, 2019",2, incredible buggy
30,Darth Chillash,"July 3, 2019",4," Works very good. Please make the Android app icon adaptive, not just circular."
31,Reza Armin,"August 29, 2018",4, Hi. The members do not show on app just can see past chats done by windows software. Please advice and support
32,Daniel Malik,"August 23, 2018",1, It doesn't send messages.
33,A Google user,"August 3, 2018",2," Cant get any notification, whats the point of having this app"
34,Shantnu Kumar,"September 1, 2018",5, More than Just A Chatting App. Must Have app for any size organization. I personally Recommend trying this app once.
35,Tristan Tarrant,"June 7, 2018",5," The streams/topics feature alone sets this apart. Great collaboration tool 
that allows narrowing down to the single conversation while not losing 
track of concurrent discussions"
36,Shashi Kumar Fagna,"August 2, 2018",3, Improve ui very hard to understand
37,A Google user,"June 10, 2018",1, Not native. Doesn't feel good at all
38,Greg McCoy,"May 14, 2018",5," Great app with a well thought out layout. Would love to see ability to add 
new user and edit profile on the app in the future."
39,Nikola Toshev,"April 19, 2018",4," Great concept and great app. However, creating new streams from the app is 
currently not working."
40,zingmars,"January 26, 2018",3," Switching between views takes ages, there isn't enough feedback when doing things like holding a message and the image viewer's menu is buggy and nothing works.

The old app is still more stable, but because they've been changing the API some things are buggy on it too, so in the end neither app is really any good. I love zulip, but O wish the apps were better."
41,Connor Sullivan,"January 16, 2018",5, Zulip offers a very streamlined service. The way that rooms are divided into groups rather than topic also offer a nice way to divide things up. I also prefer the UI of this app over others like Slack.
42,Srinivas Adireddi,"December 29, 2017",5, This is my favourite group chat. It's very productive and cool! I can catch up useful messages and ignore unnecessary ones! Simple. Must try for sure.
43,A Google user,"October 10, 2019",4," Better than rocketchat, mattermost or slack. My first comment was 2017. Saddly zulip still not popular ‚òπÔ∏è"
44,Sethu Senthil,"December 28, 2017",5," A different approach to business chatting. Instead of topics, chats are built around groups. This could be helpful depending on your work flow. A cleaner UI would be a great addon."
45,Jonathan Dayem,"January 13, 2018",5," Clean UI, easy, accessible, would recommend to anyone! Zulip is great alternative to any other open source group chat as well."

This allows us to have multiple conversations at the same time without conversations interfering with each another. It also allows us to reference conversations without clutter. Its threaded model helps people working in different timezone's communicate effectively.
