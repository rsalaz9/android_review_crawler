But it feels like I have to update it every 5 seconds now for it to even function properly. It crashes a lot, has weird glitches such as items or restaurants (sometimes everything) being ""currently unavailable"" for days, not being able to order, getting to check out then have the app clear and go back to home page. Long story short it feels like it doesn't function anymore, or at least the chance that it does are stupidly low. You can do better, so do it."

However, after the last update is force closes on me randomly and doesn't appear to be working at all. What sucks is the service. Drivers randomly cancelling orders, not able to find addresses, food arriving cold, food arriving wrong, etc. I know it's hard to control quality with something like this, but it's just bad. Other similar apps have their issues, but nothing like Uber IMO."

EDIT: In response to the developer's inquiry for more details, essentially I had issues that I later learned were caused by me having duplicate accounts. It would be nice if there were a way I could have gotten help directly in the app either via chat with or sending a message to support. Added one star to my since the developer reached out."

I had to uninstall and reinstall for it to open. Also had issues with my map pin- until recently it was incorrect compared to my actual address. It was frustrating to not be able to choose my map pin and has caused confusion with drivers to the point where I have to include delivery instructions so they don't get lost. Pin is fine now somehow, though I changed nothing."
7,Mr. Deadhead,"April 23, 2020",1," the fact that you have to go through the uber app and delete any previous payment options because the uber eats app doesn't even let you choose one, and always uses the first on the list (aka the oldest, usually expired), is the stupid design flaw that has made me not use them like 5 times now. also...Full Reviewthe fact that you have to go through the uber app and delete any previous payment options because the uber eats app doesn't even let you choose one, and always uses the first on the list (aka the oldest, usually expired), is the stupid design flaw that has made me not use them like 5 times now. also a 15% service fee that drivers don't get is just bull, and way too much for an app that doesn't even work right."

Support and help is damn near not existent when you have an issue. That's the most frustrating part."

The default view is not really a sort order."

Didn't get any notification of the cancellation until the end of the delivery window, resulted in a meal that was not what we wanted. Emails to support (multiple) came back with generic, possibly AI created responses that didn't resolve the issue, or answer the direct questions that I asked. Request for escalation to a level that could answer questions remain unanswered a week later."

I complained, it honestly seemed to get fixed right away and I was happy. But as of latest update I get only server errors again and the app is 100% unusable. For an app that doesn't work more often than it does, it seems even more ridiculous now that you charge service fees and small order fees to begin with - for an app that doesnt work. No wonder Skip is becoming more popular than you."

16,B Mal,"April 24, 2020",1," Since the latest update, the app has become unusable. After adding items to the cart, when you attempt to go to checkout, the app crashes back to the main screen (wiping the cart in the process).

I will say one thing about this app is their customer service is very lacking in the sense that they basically took my money and basically said ""we're sorry; its past the limited time we can issue a refund"" when my issue was prolonged by weeks. Was a great idea and I'm sure they could probably redeem themselves but as a customer they have lost my business."

Up until a few days ago, when I placed a order for a Pizza Hut delivery. The order was accepted at first, the app showed ""preparing"" for about a minute, then switched to ""The resturant has rejected the order, and you will not be charged"". I have seen this before, so I thought nothing of it, and ordered from another resturant. Then it turns out I was charged for both orders. And I have been back and forth with Uber Eats over the matter for days now. They first insisted I had cancelled the order myself. (I had not, and I have the app screencap to show it was cancelled due to being ""currently unavailable"".) Then they changed the story to claim it had actually been delivered to me. Which it had not. They have sent me a loop of the same emails and nobody believes me when I say I did NOT cancel the order, nor was it delivered. And I have sent them the screencap from the app. I have now filed a complaint with my bank."

Contacted help & was hung up on after being told someone else in the family must have used my card.

239,Danny Maefengea,"April 17, 2020",5, It's a great app. I like the meals that are available in it. The deliveries are also quick and easy. You have many choices to choose from so it's really good and reliable. I recommend you start using it.
240,Tony C,"April 21, 2020",3," Sometimes I find it a little confusing, then there's the huge price jump over what it costs if you at at the place or picked it up yourself. But I'm lazy once in a while and use it."
241,Amanda Nicotera,"April 17, 2020",5, Easy to use. Prompt tracking information. Had better luck with people being able to find my weirdly marked apartment than other food ordering apps. I think the directions Uber gives are more precise.
242,L Yamashita,"April 24, 2020",4," Its helpful, and easy to use. The only thing I dont like is it's hard to adjust certain things like no sauce or put sauce on sides for lots of restaraunts."
243,Jordan Crombie,"April 15, 2020",1," Been working since Christmas, and last update just broke it for good. No permission issues but apparently I have to set an address and can't find it due to a server error. Typical. Time for deliveroo"

245,Rouge Anatra,"April 24, 2020",1," There have been a lot of crashes where when I go to checkout, the whole app closes and when in progress of an order, it says it's not available. I have nearly missed several order deliveries due to it."
246,Adrienne Stone,"April 24, 2020",2," App will not apply my Uber Cash (via AMEX rewards and a credit for a wrong order) despite following all directions. App also crashes on occasion or says ""unavailable in your area"" even though I live in Las Vegas. So far very unimpressed."

This is literally the worse food app and i have tried them all do yourself a favor and download literally anything else."
248,Emily McKeon,"April 23, 2020",1, Your app crashes more times than I've been able to successfully order. It's actually trash. I've tried ordering ten times now and all it does is crash when I get to the checkout screen. Tried on Android and iPhone. Nothing.
249,K V,"April 9, 2020",1, NFC Error. Won't let me add any of my cards as payment options both by it's scanning feature as well as by manual entry. A complete waste of my time and I ended up ordering by DoorDash.
250,Jordan Lund,"April 15, 2020",2," App works fine, service is very unreliable. Food delivers late, if at all. Multiple times I get the message that the order is cancelled, unable to find out why. Too many other similar services that are stable to recommend."
251,sal Ruiz,"April 22, 2020",1, Doesn't allow to input a new number for my old account its bleeping annoying 🤬💥fix this issue asap!!! Go back to old setup where you just needed your darn email to log in make shut so complicated!!!
252,Reina Trumpet,"April 24, 2020",1," Im not sure if it's the update itself... But each time im just about to veiw my cart and order, the app glitches and directs me back to the home page. Other times the app conpletely crashes and looses my order and time."
253,Marco Tjokro,"April 9, 2020",3," Why all of the sudden the majority of restaurants become unavailable? Even when the restaurant is open (e.g. McDonalds, Burger King, etc.). This happens too frequent and the developers need to look at this."

257,Xio chio,"April 22, 2020",4, It's a great service ! Lots of extra fees involved which really bloats the prices of food. Hopefully over time they can bring those fees down or someone else comes in the competition.
258,Jasen Sokoloski,"April 24, 2020",1, I got the app to order food from at home. Every time I have put food in my cart to order it the app will crash. I have tried to redownload and restart the app but nothing helps. Would not recommend using this app. Just use a different food delivery company
259,Jessica Wargo,"April 11, 2020",1, I wanted to use the order ahead feature. I selected the time frame I wanted and uber eats processed it as immediate delivery instead of scheduled. There is also a service fee that other delivery services don't have. Unlikely to use this app again.
260,clrcdvn art,"April 9, 2020",1," Just installed, says i'm already registered but there's no other way on the main screen to 'login' except 'get started' by entering phone number and registering etc. Can't move on so, uninstalled straight away."
261,Sadaf Al Arabi,"April 17, 2020",1," Login option Doesn't work most of the time, Orders take hours and hours, And most restaurants are just straight lying with the photos and product description. Also every damn thing is too expensive with the vat and all other charges"
262,diane eson,"April 24, 2020",1, This app has crashed on me for the last 2 days. When I go on the website it tells me it has a problem creating my order. This is after trying to check out of 3 different restaurants. I'm not sure what is going on
263,Ryusuke Fukazawa,"April 23, 2020",4," Sometimes crashes on me, but other than that a really good app. I use this often now, since I can't go out and I feel like it's cheaper than many other food delivery apps."

I once happened to receive a message from the driver that he was outside of the door and when I got out he was still driving around and arrived 4 minutes later. Or sometimes it shows the wrong vehicle like for example once I ordered a delivery and the driver was supposed to be on a bicycle but instead he was in the car and I couldn't find him and had to call again
266,Monty Smith,"April 18, 2020",1, Unusable. Latest update means I cant get past the screen where it wants my address. Uninstalled and reinstalled app to no avail. That and the incessant price increases tell me they just don't want my business. Very well then.

268,Lovall Farmer,"April 17, 2020",5, Excellent app for this time of need I can't complain I'm happy for the drivers and all of people who cannot afford to go and around due to the recent chain of events it helps us all thanks to the team at uber and of course the Google team for making moments like this possible
269,Damian Brito,"April 12, 2020",1, Too many problems with this app. Latest one was that the app would display and processed orders for closed restaurants. 3 times. I ended up cancelling my pass and taking it off. Even with the customer reps on the phone are no help.
270,Lourdes Pietri,"April 11, 2020",5," Love that they added $0 delivery for supporting local restaurants, and the employee relief fund! That's the kind of business I want to support. Plus, the app is really easy to use and efficient."
271,Andy Stockings,"April 19, 2020",1," Only installed because I had an introductory voucher. No ability to get infornation on restaurant's location meant I had to use google or menulog to find out, making the whole process very frustrating."

273,Tyran Jessica,"April 18, 2020",4, Overall great app. Did have a couple random cancellations with no reason given but no issues other than that. Use this all the time.
274,Varun Bhandarkar,"April 21, 2020",3, It was working fine until a few weeks ago and since then I can't allow it to access my location or enter my address manually. I have tried reinstalling it to no avail.

339,R L,"April 16, 2020",4, The App works fine for the most part. Just wish it wasn't so easy to mistakenly order food or make it easier to cancel if you mistakenly did order. Right now at most you may have mere seconds to cancel an order. I would love a minimum of 30.

363,Chris Boelte,"April 21, 2020",5, Its a lot like uber (go figure) but its pretty simple and dose good at the bottom line of getting food for you. If you're looking for a food delivery app this one is a great choice.
364,Tyler Krenbrink,"April 13, 2020",1, Nothing is in range after order is created despite it showing as nearby EDIT (Reply): The issue remains that restaurants that are unable to make delivery are still showing up as available to make delivery until you go to pay. This makes finding a delivery a crapshoot right now.
365,El Beaton-Bloomfield,"April 12, 2020",2, App works as expected. What wasn't expected was the Service Fee. Free delivery sounds attractive until you realize it's a token fee anyway.

The estimated wait time can be a little ambitious and the delivery charge just increased so its certainly not something you'd use every week.

Now, my app isn't working at all, and gets stuck on the 'add your delivery address' page. Very disappointed."

924,Justin Newton,"April 4, 2020",1, The app no longer loads anything it won't even get pass the title card it just sits there. Both wifi and data won't change anything. When it does load no pictures of the restaurants won't load or anything else It's very frustrating

I got charged the wrong amount and i couldn't even start a chat or send an email. I had to google customer service who put me on hold 3 times only to tell me a supervisor will call me back in fifteen minutes. Which was 2 hours ago. Other services are much better and convenient. Ubereats disappoints unfortunately. Pay attention to your card charges for unauthorized fees

1181,Kelly Yum,"April 7, 2020",4, It freezes half the time and I'd have to re input the order. It happens so often that I just give up and don't bother ordering. It also crashes more often than it works.
1182,Adrian,"April 13, 2020",1, It won't let me update my phone number because I no longer have my old number. Because of this I can't use the app.
1183,Chase Blaser,"April 11, 2020",1, Advertised free delivery and all they took off was $1.99. Then have a service fee of 1.99 and delivery of 3.99. Happened twice and wont be using again. They wouldn't respond to my dm on Twitter nor is there a way to directly communicate with them on the app.

1188,Amy Fry,"February 24, 2020",4," I think this app is great at times but has its draw backs, sometimes it doesn't work but other times it's simple and easy to use. I have had faults with this app but nothing big enough to report."

You can tip afterwards, but I've had technical issues changing occasionally. Deliveries will often be piggybacked on yours for free delivery on their part, but you will still get charged the delivery fee and will often receive your order after the person who got the free delivery, which seems like a lose-lose situation. Customer service is mediocre - more responsive than some other apps, but not very effective in resolving issues."
1191,craig ledermann,"April 2, 2020",4, Very convenient and has a larger choice pool then most other services. Only issue I have is the cost seems to have increased with service charges.

1198,Alastair Ramsay,"March 5, 2020",1," App experience is absolutely terrible. You can only chat to support via the notification on your phone once they respond. It's great until there is a problem, there are no contact options at all. Used several times with no issue but now switched to Just Eat."
1199,Geraldine Molina,"March 8, 2020",3," It is a good app except that on some restaurant sites, you are not able to make special requests. For example, the Subway site does not work when asking them to leave off certain items off a sandwich or requesting a certain dressing like spicy brown mustard."
1200,Jeannette Fuller,"March 12, 2020",1, App stopped working on 3/11. You cant set your location and when you do it gives an error message. Then if you actually get it to work when you go to pay it says your payment isn't valid and that there is a network error. I just had food delivered 4 days ago.
1201,Morgan B,"April 3, 2020",1," It doesnt offer all the options on restaurants menus, like sauces and stuff. And it doesnt give an option to leave notes to get the stuff that uber eats app doesnt list. Edit: no.. the ""special instructions "" were unavailable."

1212,richard tovar,"February 26, 2020",1, App doesnt show all the restaurants that are available. Format has changed. No way to contact support except for an issue with an order. Have used this app for too long to have problems now. Second guessing the uber pass. Gold membership obviously means nothing.
1213,Asi B,"March 8, 2020",1," Couldn't even get it to let me into the actual app. I enter my number and email and it tells me it's already registered, but won't give me any other way to log in. Absolutely ridiculous."

1216,Rachel K,"March 18, 2020",3," I like the service, but the app could use some tweaks. Would like to be able to search by a specific food. Also, would like to be able to make specific comments when reviewing an order and rate by a number of stars vs. just thumbs up/down."
1217,Daniel Hong Koon Tan,"March 21, 2020",1," Difficult to use. Even though I have provided 2 credit card details for payment options, one being for business use and another for personal use, the app never asked which one to use. It just picked the last used card."
1218,Bernard J Mugendi,"March 21, 2020",4," The app is great, pretty straightforward. Although, there needs to be a better integration of payment options for the Kenyan context. For instance, the use of mpesa."
1219,Richard S,"March 29, 2020",5, I have been very happy with this app as it helps me deliver a much needed variety of food to my grandparents. Wish the delivery and service fees could be zeroed out for delivery to seniors.
1220,Clyde Mitchell,"March 28, 2020",1," I try to order meals from Jack in the Box through the app, but it forces me to get fries and drink on the side; either I end up spending more money than I have to ON TOP OF ANY FEES (as opposed to going myself), or deciding to be cheap and not order as much food as I'd like."

1235,Dinusha Pathirana,"March 11, 2020",5, Very easy interface to use. The orders are delivered surprisingly quickly and the tracking feature is very useful and accurate. Overall i think its the best app to order food.
1236,Theresa Boateng,"April 6, 2020",2, The app itself is a brilliant concept. Very disappointing delivery; there is always food items missing or damaged food. Uber won't do anything if they think you claim too much. Your money goes down the drain and you're out of pocket.

1401,Leigh Kennedy,"March 4, 2020",5," This app is so user friendly. It would be great if it used location data better instead of assuming that you are still at your previous location. It would also be great if it would provide tax invoices rather than sub-par receipts. Other than that, it's fantastic."
1402,Sugar Sammie,"March 9, 2020",3, It's an inexpensive service in comparison to the alternatives however I often receive orders with missing or incorrect items though I do believe that is more on the communication within resturants than the app. However when I address it...it never seems to be a pleasant interaction.
1403,Deshawn Stewart,"March 19, 2020",1, I recently got a new number and tried to set up an account I cannot create an account because the previous owner of this number already had an account. There should be some way to reset the numbers!

1417,Ashley Hosten,"February 23, 2020",5," The app is excellent. The only problem is that if you have 2 phones, it often won't recognise you, if your main phone battery is dead. But the service and support are of the highest quality."
1418,Luis Velez,"February 29, 2020",5," This app is great i tried it for the first time today and didn't have any issues logging in,loading or placing my order. What i like about Uber is seeing where the driver is so you know when he or she arrives. 👍"
1419,manipulative1000,"March 6, 2020",1," They did a update to the app this year that makes it virtually impossible to get ahold of customer service, even when you step outside the app and start looking for Uber customer service on Google."

I compared the same restaurant (Popeyes in this case) and gave a 4$ tip on both apps and found Doordash to be several dollars more with the same items and it has a longer delivery time. Not a jab at Doordash just a comparison. Would highly recommend Uber Eats if you cannot get out of work for lunch.
1421,Yesh Rasy,"March 9, 2020",1, Deleting as the Eats app no longer works for me and the advised steps for resolution don't work/appropriate help options don't exist. Trying to get assistance is near impossible. Will stick to other apps from now on.

1451,Illia Shcherbakov,"March 21, 2020",1, Location detection is awful. Houses can have letters next to its numbers. This is crucial and the app cant detect it. And constant delivery estimate change is weird. This function becomes just useless if estimate changes every 5 mins.

Therefore, in my city, at least, they hired a lot of new people. The result: you have to deal with persons that cannot deal with a GPS or Waze, are rude in conversation with the client, since they go, accordind to tracking, in a compleletely different place and, at the end, they deliver to samebody else several blocks to you. If.. Shamefull cause is a matter of principle not money."

1585,Justin Sison,"March 13, 2020",1," Garbage app. Promotions often can't be applied even though it's directly shown on the app and, more importantly, many menu items won't let me add to cart unless I chose ALL THE OPTIONAL items."

Yesterday and on Monday and they don't know this is happening. I thought maybe they had an update. So I updated it and tried again today. Just to get the same cancel my order. This is very frustrating and no one from the company knows why this happening. I'm not the only one going through this.
1686,Tyler Davison,"February 19, 2020",2," Pretty rare that the restaurants listed are near enough for delivery since I'm outside city limits. Also, this app has delivered things to an address 10 miles away. Twice. I guess it's my bad for thinking that GPS and me typing my address could enough"
1687,Deni Broomes,"February 21, 2020",2," The app won't allow you to input your address correctly. It's stupid that when I keep editing the address, it keeps changing it."
1688,HortonSway,"March 20, 2020",5, The app is amazing! You can see exactly where the person bringing your food is. You get flash deals which sometimes are great!!!
1689,Jason Wakeham,"March 19, 2020",3, The app has become more stable and now actually figured out I'm within distance of most local eateries. Still has issues some of the time. Just need to improve the drivers and think we are on a winner!
1690,Dezra Davies,"March 21, 2020",2, I downloaded the app again to see if it was used in my area yet but can do anything because when I put details in it says already registered but there's nowhere to enter the site any other way than the let's get started what a nightmare
1691,Saphron,"March 20, 2020",1, Worthless. Cant log in or start an account to use the app because I made an account to be a driver for uber 2 years ago and there is no log in to existing account option. Only create a new account
1692,Melissa Llamzon,"March 25, 2020",1, everytime i try to use this app it freezes and kicks me out. i am unable to complete any order unless i try multiple times. i usually give up and end up using a different service. very disappointing experience with this app

1694,Dominic Poothokaran,"April 4, 2020",5," In this covid19 quarantine, Uber eats have been a great help. I am an immigrant without a phone connection, but the chat feature on the app helped me guide the delivary man to the house."
1695,steve kosin,"April 7, 2020",3," Ubereats is actually best of all the food delivery apps as it shows soups from menus near you, but I'm disappointed that have every type of food, including salad, with their own tabs, but no tab for soup.

1708,Chris,"March 3, 2020",1, Everything is great but way too expensive. Meal prices are inflated over competitor apps. No option for membership for a one off monthly delivery payment for power users. The only benefit to uber eats is speed of delivery which I use it for.
1709,Kerim Wild,"March 14, 2020",1," The app keeps showing server error and is not working therefore. I also can't even delete my payment method, since the error is showing even there. I can't recommend it."

Always handoff at the car, they never get out and walk up. GREAT APP!!!"
1721,Kyle Harrity,"February 19, 2020",1," Opens and asks for delivery address, but when I search it never loads... Got a response from customer service to clear app cache. Have done so, does not fix issue."
1722,Michaela Eitzen,"March 9, 2020",4," Pretty great. Not so nice when there's load shedding but overall, I'm pretty happy with Uber Eats. When I've had problems (rarely), everything has been sorted out."
1723,Alana Harper,"March 21, 2020",4," For the most part UE has been great. The app needs to have a required section to add requests and extras. For example syrup flavors, extra napkins, etc."

1804,Joe Gallegos,"March 18, 2020",1," Doesn't seem to work. I open the app. I log-in. It goes to an ""enter address"" bar then nothing. No response to anything."
1805,Keegan H,"March 21, 2020",3, An idea for the team and devs: prompt location selection before customer hits pay button to make sure the customer has selected the correct address before paying for meal. This will save you guys alot of time and money in the long run.
1806,karvon clause,"March 30, 2020",1, First time seems great. Was awesome company but now I received two different orders. So I having no choice but to let me credit card company deal with them I was hoping to fix this issue before it came to this.

1809,Tabitha Milewski,"March 26, 2020",5," Great service! I've never been disappointed by Uber eats.

1832,Josh Jackson,"February 18, 2020",1, I had an account with uber eats I receive emails etc and now my account has been signed out of and all it says for me is to get started there is no sign in option. The app could do with a sign in option.

Great for those who cannot get out to shop and cook on occasions. I tend to order a large main to share, and cook some extra veg at home. Great service thank you."
1838,Alexander Nowicke,"March 2, 2020",1, How can you use this app if you can't even sign in. It makes you register it doesn't allow you to sign in when you already have an account. Terrible app.
1839,Andrew Trichardt,"March 7, 2020",5, I simply enjoy the app. It keeps you up to speed with the progress and delivery. Its user friendly and saves me time.

1851,Wim Burger,"February 29, 2020",3, The items on the menus do not have descriptions of what is in on or on the dish. So I have to go to the actual restaurant's website to first see what it consists of and then go back to Uber Eats App before I can order. Fixing that will make my rating 5 Stars.
1852,Renee Brooks,"March 6, 2020",4, Great app and how easy it is to order and pay. Uber eats delivers on there word. Definitely will be using it again.

1922,Maria Tranfaglia,"March 10, 2020",5," Easy to use, organized set up, and a great variety of food options. Easy to track orders."
1923,kaiserHD Booi,"March 16, 2020",1, The app wont allow me to use any of my payment options. I tried deleting them and adding them again but that didnt work. Its freaking annoying considering how big this company.
1924,brazenlad,"March 16, 2020",4," App is great! Only 4 stars due to issues that occur with the restaurants, which isn't Ubers fault, but I do pay for delivery so that's out of my hands."
1925,Devon White,"March 13, 2020",1, What's up with this app it keeps showing me a blank screen saying my delivery details and add a address!!. Try to go out of it and it just shuts down the app!!
1926,Lorenzo Florence,"March 13, 2020",1," Keeps on telling me my email address is already in use, but does not give me the option to log in at all. Just keeps on forcing me to register."
1927,Themis Bourdenas,"March 16, 2020",2, The help support is a joke. When things go wrong there nothing you can do and no one to reach out to. There is only a feedback that no one seems to handle. Rediculous and unreliable.
1928,Yai L.,"March 16, 2020",5, Super easy to use app! Great variety of restaurants available. Very user friendly and you constantly receive discount coupons!
1929,Roddz Backyard BBQ,"March 24, 2020",5, Easy order... picked up on time... drop off in great condition... bag was sealed... and was able to follow my order... Great app to use if you can't get out or just being lazy.
1930,Ab Mutha,"March 27, 2020",1, I don't know why this app asked me about my phone number and not work. What a bad service . What is the meaning of your account does not have a password?????
1931,Nigel Gilmore,"March 27, 2020",5," Normally fantastic, but due to some invisible monsters named corona the service has been lacking of late....wish it expanded to more items tho.... Beer... Etc."
1932,Bruce Bullard,"March 27, 2020",5, No major problems yet. Always let's me know if a restaurant is open or closed which solves a big pet peeve of mine.
1933,Luana Behnke,"March 27, 2020",1," It does not cover all areas of the city, including my neighborhood, so there is no way to use the services, a pity, one less user."

1943,Marie Jones,"February 18, 2020",1," Do not use this service. I had to out the order in twice because the app refreshed and it doesn't save. Delivery estimates are complete fiction. STILL waiting for food ordered an hour and 40 minutes ago. Funnily enough, the app crashes when I try to cancel."
1944,Jenn Austen,"February 16, 2020",1," Fraudulent charges were made to my credit card through this app, which tells me it's not secure. I have deleted the app and asked that any account associated with my email address be deleted."
1945,Jared Michalski,"February 12, 2020",5, Very easy to use. Little more expensive than getting it yourself. But cheaper than DUI!!!
1946,Black KnightS2k,"March 2, 2020",1, This is incredibly difficult for support! If you have an issue you may aswell uninstall this app because the support is a nightmare!
1947,Lacee Masters,"March 6, 2020",5, I love this app. Having no transportation makes things very difficult so having this app is so convenient! I recommend it every chance i get!
1948,Boyd,"March 14, 2020",4, Works most of the time. Android version does not have trading hours of restaurants and has issues when places are closed / not available.

No explanation. Options were to ""order again"" (why bother if you're just going to cancel it later?), or ""contact support"", even though the app does not have any way to contact anyone. First time I'd used Uber Eats. And the last. Update: After eventually finding a way to contact you I got a generic, irrelevant response. Well done for making a bad experience worse."
1950,Alexander Mather,"March 17, 2020",4, Great app! For the most have had great service but on occasion I have had terrible delivery. But 4/5 it has been exceptional!
1951,Alexandra Albrecht,"March 22, 2020",4," Very nice features in the app, one option I miss, the automatic translation of menus if it's not in English."
1952,Brijesh Parmar,"March 18, 2020",4, Every thing is good. Just 1 thing which could be improved is how easily 1 could reach agent ..some thing like chat option.
1953,Kara Price,"March 27, 2020",5, Easy to navigate and great fast service. The tracking feature give assurance of on time delivery
1954,El Ray,"April 2, 2020",1, I'm never using uber eats again. Buggy app. Lots of separate issues. Ate up my gift card without applying the balance Won't let me reapply. Tried to reset password and no email sent. Uber eats is a joke of a company these days.
1955,Teresa B,"April 5, 2020",4, Works well every time I've used it. 4 stars because nothing is ever perfect.

1961,ahtsham ali,"March 6, 2020",5, Got new phone and number but wont let me sign in. Wants me to type new phone number then when I type in my email it says this email is already registered. So why is there not a sign in button?
1962,Eric Jukiewicz,"February 16, 2020",4," Used this app so many times with no issue. The one time I have an issue, no help. Called customer service and spoke with manager she told me to speak with Uber corporate. I spead hundreds a week and this is what I get. Use lyft"

1966,Camilo Ruiz,"February 27, 2020",3," All kinds of extra fees that never existed. Good communication and service but the ""service fee"" plus all other markups drive your bill almost double its size"
1967,K Moore,"March 20, 2020",1, I'm a platinum rewards member and I can't even get decent support on an issue for my account.

It's very annoying that the drivers are sent an incorrect location and I don't have the ability to change it. Nothing has ever been delivered directly to my door because of this. They are sent 10 houses away! The app doesn't have the ability to directly contact support for issues, not good."
1969,j j,"March 12, 2020",1, Tried signing up to become a uber eats driver. It's so complicated. Can't log in account already created with old phone number so text always goes to old phone which I no longer have. Tried creating a new sign up account and got no where.

2022,Ted C,"March 31, 2020",3, App is very functional. But all of the fees added to your order makes it to expensive to us often.
2023,Ian Haynes,"April 1, 2020",1, I received a $25 gift card and it ate up all of the money and it charged my credit card/ATM to my bank which made me overdrawn so the bottom line is it never registered my number from the card and I can't tell if it used it or it didn't.

The biggest issue is missing food, it's something I can handle but telling your child that there Saturday night treat, is missing the part they wanted the most isn't good. The drivers should be checking what is going into the order and ensure it matches what has been ordered."
2050,John Staines,"February 12, 2020",4," Works well. A bit feature busy eg I don't want ""recommendations"". Smells more like ""marketing"". Ads severly detract from the order process by distraction"

2056,John Pham,"March 27, 2020",2, The app wouldn't allow me to enter in a tip amount so I ended up tipping my driver Hector $0. I cant even change the tip amount because the instructions from the website don't match what app allows. I've spent more time trying to change the tip amount than actually browsing/ordering.

2058,Charles Kubota,"March 31, 2020",3, Throws random errors. I suspect the stores are closed but they're not listed as closed.
2059,keerthi sudarsanan,"April 6, 2020",1, I downloaded the app and then used my email I'd and all it shows is wrong password where as I'm sure it's the password and when I click on forgot password and enter my email id it says the I'd dosnt exist and my number is not linked with it
2060,Jordan pellerin gardner,"April 10, 2020",4, So far no issues sucks when you want 20$ of food but cost you 30 but hey it's convinient and quick.

2071,David Mussan-Levy,"February 21, 2020",1, This app never works. Literally never. No matter what I do it just gets stuck on the address screen giving an error.
2072,Matthew Johnson,"February 24, 2020",1," Horrendous - the app allows the delivery partner to add a comment about an issue, but the customer cannot comment in response. This is very frustrating when the delivery partner tells a lie."
2073,Eddie McMorrow,"February 26, 2020",5, Easy to use. I like you can see progress of the driver getting your order. Discounts for delivery hi helps too.

2099,Makeda J,"March 2, 2020",5, Excellent. I'm glad that the promotions are ALREADY there to apply now. Instead of customers adding it themselves after receiving a email promotion.
2100,Aoife Coyne,"March 7, 2020",3, Sometimes difficult to navigate when ordering. If you have been given a loyalty voucher/money off it doesn't automatically link to the app and as a result have missed out on a discount.
2101,Emma Gwozdzicki,"March 7, 2020",5, Great app!! Easy to use and great to see on the map where the driver is! 😁

I wish I could take the one star I was forced to give you

2135,Solid Snake,"February 7, 2020",1, HOW do I view the address of the place I want to pick up from? Like I don't see it anywhere.... It just shows the distance like 2.3m with no other information. Pretty useless.

2144,Marvin McGuire,"March 20, 2020",1, This app sucks and this company sucks. No way to update your phone number and they have no easy way to get in contact with a customer service hotline.

2196,Amanda Philpott,"February 23, 2020",5, Great app but wish more could be done about restaurants that mess up food though besides reporting it as nothing seems to come of it. (Recieved some very burnt food that should not have been packaged for delivery)
2197,Tshegofatso Ramafoko,"February 24, 2020",1," Bad services!! I tried to report an unrecognized charge to my account, but there has been no reply. The support landline is unreachable, and the app won't send my Uber Eats data to my email"
2198,Kamlin Reddy,"February 26, 2020",4, Could've rated 5 stars but the price of the food is clearly priced much higher on the app. All things considered great UX and fast delivery times... happy customer!

Cancel option just comes for about 2 seconds and disappears, then what's the use of that Cancel Option, and there is no way to Contact Uber Eats Customer Service and Help option in the App is Truly Useless. Please fix this"
2202,Latia Rucker,"March 14, 2020",4," Good communication.. accurate times...but had a few instances where my food was stolen by driver, also where I've seen ba restaurant in my area just for me to check out and I'm told the location is too far from me ."

2214,Isa Bel,"April 11, 2020",1, THEY DID NOT INCLUDE THE SERVICE TILL AFTER CHECK OUT. I would not mind it if it was upfront about it but being charged without knowing the service fee is almost criminal.

I've been using UberEats so much since this quarantine started that I have no clue why it decided to do this to me. I tried placing an order worth $50 on the app but did not receive the normal confirmation page. I went to the Upcoming Orders page and saw nothing so I assumed it didn't go through. I placed the same order again and the same thing happened. I finally went to the website and saw I had TWO orders from the SAME restaurant worth $100
2231,Sharon Fung,"February 12, 2020",1," Was good before, but there's no way to contact cs on the app, so at times like now, when my food keeps getting delayed, i have no way to find out what is going on.

My disappointment lies in the fact that there is a service fee on top of a delivery fee. Couple those with taxes and a tip and I am essentially paying for another meal. As if those concerns weren't alarming, by the time I order my meal, the delivery time is almost an hour if not an hour. So, I've now paid in fees for an extra meal and the original order I've placed is delivered to me an hour later and cold or dry. (chicken, etc.) There's no discount for returning customers."
2238,gerardo medina,"March 9, 2020",5," Easy to use, and a smart way to bring your food anywhere you are. I haven't gotten any late delays, the people delivering it, have this great first impression. Absolute genius. Thanks #Ubereats"

One of my orders had missing items, support said I would get a refund but it never arrived. Furthermore, the only way to get support is through the app or webpage, no support phone. So, if you don't get your order right, buy something else to it anywhere else (for example, Just Eat) because you won't get help instantly, if you manage to get help... Overall, very bad experience. I would recommend Just Eat a thousand times over Uber Eats."

2587,Zag Bbx,"February 9, 2020",1," Cant put my exact address into the app so using this is horrible, every time i have done the driver has had trouble finding my place."
2588,Trudy Pryce,"February 12, 2020",4, The addition to service charges and small order charge is disappointing and the main reason I am giving the app 4 stars and not 5. Customer service and refunds on incorrect orders is usually easy. Large number of restaurants and select variety.
2589,Nelly Espinoza,"February 14, 2020",5," It has helped me when I have been sick, hungry, tired and depressed by feeding me without the hassle of going out and interact with other people."

2593,Luke Vesty,"March 13, 2020",2," Your search results are really, really off and have been for a long while. When I search ""Pizza Co"", a specific local pizza restaurant, I end up with several results - pizza related restaurants, but also Indian, Italian and Thai restaurants, and fish and chips... But not Pizza Co itself."

2596,Fiona Taupe,"March 20, 2020",4, 4 stars because some days it's quick and fast and then some days it's slow due to the drivers or the app itself when it processes my order.
2597,Rebekah Huang,"March 20, 2020",5, Really good - except I can't edit my address which is a pain!
2598,Joanna Iskandar,"March 20, 2020",1," The app itself is OK, just the fact that drivers are stealing food and you are charged for failed delivery attempts, which Ubereats does absolutely nothing about. Finally got refunded after multiple conversations with ubereats, but that is a lot of time wasted. Can't wait for doordash!"
2599,Zipporah Horton,"March 17, 2020",5, No issues whatsoever and the Uber Pass pays for itself in two deliveries. I use it often.

I have had multiple orders show up that are wrong or missing parts or just gave me the wrong order because the drivers do not understand how to read English. I'm not saying this in a degrading.

3121,Daniel Frasie,"March 28, 2020",1," I made it clear it won't allow me to put in a second phone # pretty simple right? Their response. "" If there is a specific incident please let us know and we can look into it further."". I Don't know how much more specific this can be..poor customer service as well."

3125,Igor Starinskij,"April 3, 2020",4, Often the meal descriptions are a bit short or absent otherwise good
3126,Monique Lynn,"April 4, 2020",3, This app has great filter options. Will be great if customers where able to see the reviews abt the resturants.

3128,Holly Golightly,"April 8, 2020",5, Love it! So convenient during the quarantine.
3129,Mike Porter,"April 23, 2020",1, App is TERRIBLE. Stupid timer! By the time I get my order ready and review it for accuracy for my family it resets. How stupid is that design? Guess I won't use Uber Eats.
3130,Alicia Marie,"April 23, 2020",1, After I try to check out the app goes back to the main page

It's very inaccurate with the consistently missing items in orders that ultimately you can't do much about at the moment you receive your order....but especially for amount of money spent they need to provide better customer service( I have a big family to please) so anything left out could effectively ruin a whole meal....its very frustrating

3138,christel laity,"March 5, 2020",2, Just as unreliable as all the other apps when it comes to tracking your order's progress. It would be AWESOME if the drivers would underestimate the speed of delivery rather than overestimating it.
3139,Viktor Caballero,"March 6, 2020",5, I have had a very good experience with the orders so far. Everything on time and no issues whatsoever. Keep improving!

3143,jester man,"March 30, 2020",4," Why is it that for Jack In the box, they don't offer combos? Everything is separate and ends up costing more than it should? Is this on your guys side or is this something from Jack In the box?"

3153,DenisMcgagnon,"April 19, 2020",2, There is no way to change the delivery adress once the order has been placed which seems like a BASIC feature for a DELIVERY app and prices are high for the delivery fees.
3154,Fazlur Rahman,"March 25, 2020",1," The application is so slow to open, which makes it annoying to use."
3155,Šimon Tóth,"February 17, 2020",5, Very clear to navigate and easy to customize orders.
3156,Vicky,"February 23, 2020",1, I don't know who designed this app i can't set location on map and if I type address it doesn't show. This type apps should be user friendly. Look at other delivery service apps like zomato and swiggy. 😡😡😡😡

3158,Garrett Donelli,"March 3, 2020",4, App works well Good tracking system Seems to be too many fees that add up quickly For only one person's meal

I had same restaurant miss food 3 times that was fixed, another example 1 sent porridge in a Starbucks take away cup, stale & bland. I fixed that also.

3233,Lindsey Velazquez,"March 3, 2020",1," It's ridiculous that you are charged for a mistake and the only way to fix the mistake is to call them and waste time talking to a representative that sounds like a porn star.

3417,Stephanie Ort,"April 11, 2020",1," Unreal. I understand that covid is holding things up, but telling me more order would take an hour and bumping it back two additional hours and the canceling it is unacceptable.

3437,Gerard Spice,"April 12, 2020",1, Let's you go through the entire order process from a restaurant just to tell you it's unavailable or too far from your location. You should be able to filter for open restaurants delivering to your location or otherwise what is the main point?

The most recent being that the app tells me that my food is delivered, it was not delivered. I did not receive any messages from the driver, the app doesn't let you communicate with the driver, if you tipped before as it automatically suggests then you need to go and find a way to untip the driver for the food that you did not get. The chat feature with their customer support wasn't helpful."

Always leads drivers to incorrect location and we have to chase each other down. I am one starring because I have raised this concern countless times to no avail. Either choose a better approximate location such as the likes of DoorDash and GrubHub or allow us to use a location pointer similar to the regular Uber app. Don't get me wrong, I love Uber Eats and was a regular customer, but I am finally fed up of this chasing game.

It was preparing for a good 40 minutes, was delivered fairly quick. I got a soggy cold burger with fries the same temperature of my drink. Overall very disappointed to have spend twice the amount I would have spend to get it myself if i was off work. I paid more for below standard 😕"

4022,Kyle North,"March 24, 2020",4," I really like the service, the driver and the experience. My only recommendation since i ordered beverages is if Uber eats supplied coolers and warmers for there drinks since my drink was luke warm and i like it hot.

4057,Roshan Jayasuriya,"March 4, 2020",5, The app doesn't allow the user to save and see the comments they may leave about the service providers. The developers should also allow the user to save notes and comments about the service providers for future references.
