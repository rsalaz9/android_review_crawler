I had to recreate several social posts because the app either crashed or reformatted the text when it saved in the library. For one of my blog posts there's an image I can't locate in the editor but shows up in the URL link to view the post. What's going on :( ?? So many great features and ideas but it's just not working well!

When I hit save and publish and look at it on browser, entire text/image of the post was deleted/gone (except for one sentence) and now there's no way to restore. Now I just have to take down post completely so I can think hard and write exactly the same words again. Nice work.üëç"

The amount of work I've lost because it hasn't saved or you get a message popping up on the screen, saying 'something has gone wrong, we're working on it's, is soul destroying. I've been into this morning to look at a blog in my draft folder, that I started 4 weeks as part of a product review, 3/4 of it is missing. Also if you're working from the desktop version, it hasn't been converting over updates to the app."
3,Matt Mikuleza,"April 20, 2020",5, Extraordinary! I have a blog on here and it is the best platform I have used. The app is very user friendly for the manager. Editiing everything is so easy to do with great options and they allow so much room for creativity. I love this app and I look forward to growing my fanbase on it.

I finish all my work on my laptop and when I open it in the app all my written stuff disappears then it disappears on my laptop too .. the app is not refreshing properly .. this problem started after the recent update.. also we need an undo or go back option on the blog. So when things like this happens we have a safety net
5,Brian Baccay,"April 20, 2020",2," First, i can't upload a photo directly while i'm editing one of my blogs, i have to go to media manager, upload it there, and choose it inside the blog editor. 2nd, i can't see the photo that i uploaded. Fix your app. I can only edit texts."
6,marta eustice,"April 21, 2020",2, I like the app but every time there is an update it messes something up. After last update I don't get notifications when someone goes on my website. Please fix this issue. 20.04.2020 The same issue again No notifications when ppl are visiting website.

Changes made in app don't always sync. Email campaigns done in the app ends up with all sentences running together when you open the message. It makes you look unprofessional when really the app is messing it up."

There is no SIGN IN AT TOP RIGHT. The most obvious and critical button is missing so there is no way to access your website once you wasted millions of hours creating it.
9,Sanket Shah,"April 22, 2020",2," The app just won't show details for any selection, like when you click on the order, it's simply a plain screen with nothing on it. This is a critical compinent for me to ensure orders are marked confirmed and fulfilled in time. App seems to be structured well and that's the only good part."

The app doesn't work well with your browser. Whenever I update my photo gallery via the app it doesn't update the same gallery in my browser. When I edit this gallery in my browser it doesn't show the most recent photos which also always changes the appearance of the actual gallery on the website. Makes me look extremely unprofessional! Plus editing blog posts is still a nightmare since a decade. Cursor randomly jumps all over your text if you're not super careful!
11,Randi Edwards,"April 16, 2020",1," Was great. Now I can't use. It closes and crashes. When it does open, uploaded photos only show a portion. Sometimes it won't even let me click to type. This seriously needs to get fixed. Its been so hard to edit and post certain things correctly!"

I hope the features work well over time and with an increased number of members. I would like to have an option of a white labelled app with my own branding and availability on the play store. I'm not sure if that option is available currently.
14,Kaytie,"April 24, 2020",2," This app seems to be getting worse with each update. Consrantly crashes, error messages, blog posts deleted. WHAT IS GOING ON?! Please add: hyperlinks to blog, adding categories of services, and adjusting price."
15,Kaden Ali,"April 22, 2020",2," Here we go, so, wix knows how to build websites alright but definitely not apps. Needs a lot of patching and fixing up. The dashboard hardly works just as well as the messages too. Please fix it wix, I need it post on the go!"

19,Emmer Winder,"April 24, 2020",1, I've been making a wix website and when viewed on my phone the home page has no presence. The mobile version asked me to download the app even though l already had it but once opened again theres no option to view my site? Just the older links I already had?

21,Chris Tinka,"April 8, 2020",3," Wix has added cool features, now I can edit my blog on my phone and my Pc seamlessly. However, photo caption and alt text are still missing. Also let's get a way to copy the URL for the image in the SEO section."
22,Danielle Martin,"April 12, 2020",1," Shuts down all the time! Everytime I try to check a blog post from my gym the app closes and I never get to read the post. I've tried redownloading the app, doesn't help. Please fix this."
23,Jason Ashman,"April 11, 2020",3," Great app so far, The only issue I am trying to figure out is... After i did all my setup, add a service page and updated it only to have it vanish after I went on desktop to edit and publish website."
24,Sadie Roach,"April 14, 2020",3, It's great to be able to edit or write a blog post on the go but quite often it doesn't save changes or randomly closes the app and stops working. This is very frustrating!

28,Shaquille Baffoe,"April 20, 2020",5, Loving the app so far I just created my website recently for blogs and it was very easy to make and I will be registering for premium shortly only thing you need to work on is the speed when going on the website please üëçüèø
29,C Brown,"April 22, 2020",1, I love the website but the app is very disappointing. I keep getting random form submission that arent actual customers. Very frustrating for a business owner.
30,Pranab Bagartti,"April 14, 2020",3, I really like the app for blogging. But please do add an option to change text colour and add link to the text in the app. I will give you five stars only then.
31,Abi Gueller,"April 10, 2020",1, Terrible app! Can not access my website as it keeps telling me to create one! Can't respond to messages because I can't access my website other than from a member view! Pointless.

But overall it is a good way to expose more my products. UPDATE: I had some more exploring thru out the app and I figured out how to make things 'owners eyes only'. It is pretty good app still.

I wasn't initally impressed, but decided to give it some time. Yes, the functionality is still there, but it's buried in non-intuitive places. You can easily tell the new version was pushed by people that don't actually use the product. Let's start by considering how and why people use the app. First, I like to be able to respond in real time to messages, and it's nice to see visitor and sales activity at a glance. Second, I use the app at shows to make sales onsite. Everything else the app can do is extra. Good to have, but not priority. Given this, why have you buried the PoS screen? It used to be right on the homescreen, now it is under the very non-intuitive ""Manage"" button. It took me almost 5 minutes of hunting around the first time to find it. Also, Chat is a non-intuitive place to view store orders. I'm sure there's another screen for it, but I haven't found it yet. Please, return these buttons to the homescreen, and allow me to default to my website without additional taps. Most people probably aren't managing multiple stores, and those that are can be reasonably expected to toggle between them as needed. If nothing else, for the love of all that is good and holy, please let me change away from that hot pink background and headers! It is truly awful."

I have mixed feelings about this update and here's why: When I first downloaded the app I was expecting it to be what it is now - a duplicate version of the management dashboard as on web- but I ended up utilizing the the social media posting and chat function the most. These two features are no longer in the app - when I get a notification of visitor, I can no longer see them, where they are on the site or chat with them. Same for the option to create cross platform social media posts - they simply dissappered! So I'm not happy with that at all. That being said, the app now seems to be more like the web dashboard. Wix should definitely have notified existing users about the change, since it is very dramatic and changes the way we opperate. If the features from the version before the update could be included, it'll make the app super awesome!"

What I can say though is that whatever you were doing before isn't nearly as bad as what you're doing now.

I tried to find a way to contact the support team directly but i could not find any way hence decided to write the review here.  The Forum (on the mobile app) randomly adds a line space if any text in the original forum is in bold, which does not look nice. This is not a problem in the blog (on the mobile app) so i'm guessing it should be an easy fix that you should look into.   Secondly, the notifications don't always work as expected. I.e suppose i get a notification that someone commented on my blog. Once i open the notification it doesn't take me to the specific comment on the blog post, instead it just opens the entire blog, after which i have to manually open the comments section of the relevant blog. I hope this is also fixed soon.  Thirdly, searching for members (to invite to a group in the mobile app) is quite slow. I hope this process is made smoother soon.  And lastly, whenever i invite someone to the mobile app (using invite via email option), the recipient never gets the email. Forcing me to use the website invite code to invite them to the application."

Is not so easy that i could use before. whats goin on ? i prefer the old one, when i saw the booking which is easy, and now if you want to make any bookings it still take a time and long time, and is not good for slow connection like in my place. Its really unhelpful! For the sample, I want to make a booking, the old app is easy you can just go to ""Hotels Button"" and then you can manage your booking. But now, It has to choose the Hotels, click  Manage and then Hotels manage. There you can see your booking system.  It wasting the time to wait!! Hate it....  Please Change your new system to the old one, Would be Great....  Simple is  better than the New update but Complicated. Sorry i was so angry with this :( Thanks"

1195,Scott Glazebrook,"March 24, 2019",4," I enjoy the app but there are so many updates, some of which make no sense. You have to save products multiple times, everything always seems to go the long way around! Why not ask us what we want rather than just give us what you think we do?"
1196,Laura Wells,"April 23, 2019",3," While I enjoy using WIX, it is very frustrating to post from the app. The app continues to turn my vertical images to horizontal, and my posts appear so unprofessionally. I cannot add to my galleries either."

1689,James McCullough,"February 17, 2019",1, Lose Wix quick before they double your premium rate then autodraft without any notification. I used for exactly 11 months. Def not worth the $208 price hike they tried to squeeze in there. Dont worry. Since I cant get a refund directly from you guys I'll just charge it back with my Chase acct.
1690,Rufat Abas,"May 31, 2019",1, Push notifications don't work at all. Not user friendly app. Chat delay etc.

I was so happy that I changed from my usual channel manager to use the one proposed with wix and the nightmare started.... Everything that initially seemed easy revealed itself so complicated to implement, app just useless and not user friendly at all, rates for my property difficult to set up the way I wanted them to be..... and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Only FAQs with which I had to struggle to read and find my way through....   Luckily, HotelRunner (wix partner) had wonderful people to deal with and assisted as much as they could.. They couldn't sort out everything though and I really hope that before advertising all services Wix is, they should ensure they work properly first....   And a contact person should be available to assist and answer specific request.    Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't be looking for another channel manager, that is independant to Wix should this mean I have to create a new website again...."
1694,richard hall,"August 3, 2019",3, Paragraphs merge when editing on app and can't add images to blog when using app. Where is WordPress when you need them?

It's bad for business and I went and purchased from your competitors instead. Maybe you should consider dropping your free service as it's obvious you cant afford to pay for servers to make it all work better. You just want money and dont care about customer satisfaction. So you lost a paying customer

I could open up Facebook and type a status, tumblr, twitter ANYTHING and be able to TYPE A PIECE OF WRITING. NOTHING FANCY. JUST TYPE SOME WORDS. BUT AN APP TO MANAGE MY BLOG CANNOT FUNCTION WELL ENOUGH TO TYPE A BLOG POST. every second it will crash. You can't move to another sentence without some sort of problem, you can't use any functionality beyond writing 1 sentence and then everything freaks out and the app asks me if I want to publish and freezes. I am currently writing more words in this review than I have been able to write in a BLOG APP. Awful. I am thinking about ditching my wix site completely and moving to a totally different platform."

Wix can you please email me, or message me back with a solution. your stars depend on it..."
