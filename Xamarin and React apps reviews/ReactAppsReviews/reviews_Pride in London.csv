Something I think would be a good addition is a feature where you can make your own itinerary of each act that you want to see so it is clearly set out where and when the things that interest you most are. Possibly an add button by each performance so you can attach it to your itinerary easily.

All five stars appear to be forced with nothing to say. I need two things from this app and it failed on both: the ability to see parade route and current events.. route map is the same Google map i have in phone with just events for around. There's no way to filter the events down to currently active or the day itself. The app clearly had passionate team behind it but nobody thought of using it as a user on the day.
