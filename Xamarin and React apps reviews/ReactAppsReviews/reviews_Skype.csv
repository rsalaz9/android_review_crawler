I have no setting changes that could've caused this. It happened out of nowhere. I reported the issue twice and they were absolutely no help. I've uninstalled/reinstalled 3 times. I've restarted my phone several times, I've restarted Skype several times. I've done everything I can think of and nothing will fix it."

But suddenly I cannot begin to download it on my new MacBook Air. There are many these days and each have their own jargon and I have no idea whic is suitable for my laptop. I have been trying for three months and cannot figure out which I should be aware of. Skype is not easy to contact. Any help; would be thankful.
2,Alexander Karchmin,"April 23, 2020",2," It's pretty bad app. When using it for a work: each message or group call understand all the pain of using this.

Often missing notifications, ton of lags like missing message even chat is opened, when open app - it just closed or even crashed. Poor work with RAM (consumes a lot) and all this 'great stuff's. But now I'm happy not using this anymore."

It's slow, annoying, lacks useful features. Also, it cannot be considered really private and secure. What a pity. Reading comments shows users are not happy. Reading What's New gives us no info whatsoever. And its been like that for a long time. The app seems abandoned. I'd suggest users check out Telegram, the most promising messenger, full of useful features, fast, secure, private, that really cares what its users want and is a joy to use."

I was always big fan of skype, but now that I use whatsapp, i see how a good app should look like. For 9 years i was using skype starting on android 2.x and there were always some problems with it. (Mainly with its speed and responsivness)"
5,Ashley Wood,"April 21, 2020",2," Sometimes okay. That's the best commendation I can give. It's occasionally functional.

I've had more trouble with it than any other video call app. It's eaten $30 of my money before. It sometimes doesn't let calls go through. Every single group call, at least one person is left out and can't get in the group call. Horrible app. Usable as a texting service."

7,Antonio Santimano,"April 24, 2020",4," My go to app for Voice and Video calls with my loved ones far away. Love the interface, I'm sure Microsoft could come up with ways to make it better. Only downside I had with using Skype was when sharing my screen & audio. The audio of that was not loud enough to the person I shared the video with."

It's really annoying having to keep checking the app because the notifications don't want to work. Incoming calls and messages don't show up until twenty minutes after they were sent. This has been a problem for so long, it should've been fixed by now."
12,Lanny KIM,"April 24, 2020",5," It's better than ever before. Voice and image clarity is never a Skype issue, blame it on the size of your bandwidth. I am waiting to see how Skype handles conferencing with presentations that include audiovisual presentations. However, so far so good."
13,Edward Stavin,"April 16, 2020",2," Was a top notch app before Microsoft bought it. Since then it's become a hog of space on the desktop.

On some w10 PC's you cant figure out why you are not alerted to inbound calls. And there is trouble making calls between the Skype app and Web Skype. On that matter we had a Web to Web Skype today and no matter how hard we tried, started over and searched/tested settings one party was unable to hear the other party. Video was fine both ways. Fortunately was a chat window for one party to reply"

Android App (April), Windows Metro App and Web version works good. NO COMPLAINTS. All notifications work. Clear calls. File transfers go through right away. Make sure you adjust your phone settings properly (allow all notifications) and then adjust the skype settings (allow all permisions and all notifications). Battery optimization apps tend to mess things."

So if I am at home I need to log out on my mobile so I can answer calls on the chromebook which I prefer to use, but I need to remember to log back in on mobile if I go out as I don't want to miss important calls. In addition the mobile version has the option to only receive calls on that device, but the chromebook one does not. Fairly annoying. Other than that it does what it says on the tin, a bit basic. I only use this to contact family members who aren't on Facebook Messenger."

Skype reliability/features constantly improve I'm using a Skype number in the US and that appears to work seamlessly except in the most important case of MFA since most institutions don't support the tech required. Note this is the cae with other competing services as well, so not a unique Skype problem. Though most services support video, none really support the breadth of Skype, including translation."

This is essential for conference calls."

21,Mike Beattie,"April 21, 2020",1," Awful UI, UX, and it's now like the forgotten child. This app used to be good but it's steadily declined. Every time there is an update, the experience gets worse. As of today, it's not loading any of my conversations, despite being on WiFi and have a strong signal."
22,bonami kyunda,"April 24, 2020",5," Haven't used much, but so far the experience has been the best .. as in quality. The video quality is beyond every other app i have used before, the calls are even much better. I don't remember experiencing trouble any time .. just perfect."
23,Kyle Thorgeirson,"April 23, 2020",1, This app installs itself on my tablet and has no option to remove it. The only option to uninstall is through the app store and it immediately reappears after. I've never once installed it on my device before and will never use it just for the fact that it forces itself on my device.

25,Narasimhaiah Sreehari,"April 19, 2020",5, This video conference app has a great user interface where you can do a Brady bunch of all the participants on the call. You can kick people out of the Brady bunch or pull them in. You get to see different peoples statuses easily. It is fun to use this app.
26,Aamir Haris,"April 23, 2020",1," Skype has a bug that when a call is ringing on your phone and laptop and you answer on your laptop, the phone keeps ringing. Today i was away from my phone and it was on vibrate mode, it must have vibrated for so long that my phone's vibration motor died. Damn you Skype."

36,Sutapa Das,"April 23, 2020",4, It is good but one thing is bad that is if one remove another person from the call we cannot notify him so that thing needs to be improved in this app and everyone is able to remove everyone it should be sure that only the host and admin can remove each other. Or else the app is perfect

45,Sekena Randle,"April 20, 2020",5," This app has really been helpful, especially, during this pandemic. I had Skype for years. In the past, I'd dealt with the video failing and blurriness. But, now its fantastic."
46,Nimish Jain,"April 20, 2020",3, There should not be any ad services present in this app as they are very distracting and sometimes create problems. The space of limited participants joining a video conference at no cost should be increased so that minimum requirements of a class in any organization is fulfilled.

50,Christeena Cillay,"April 21, 2020",5, I never have a problem with this app. Well almost never sometimes it'll just decide to log me out for no reason and it's always hard getting back in. But other than that I think it's a great way to keep in touch with your loved ones.
51,James Somersall,"April 19, 2020",5," It has Excellent reception and has a clear video . Doesn't freeze on you when you're on a call. It is the best video call app by far, and the best I have ever used on my phone."
52,Jeevan Patnaik,"April 17, 2020",3, -2 stars for the irritating never going away notification banners. Otherwise it deserves full rating for the call quality. Skype is the most irritating application I have on my phone. It's a flawed application doing mad things on phone and never really listen to you or understand you at all 🤦🏼‍♂️
53,Mugiwara,"April 17, 2020",3, Please add back Skype 7 for Windows and for Mobile. It was overall a better and more crisp experince. There was less transition time and the call quality with the amount of great features there were are absolutely amazing. Please add back Skype 7.
54,Deleted Deleted,"April 19, 2020",1, Skype used to be good but now after the most recent update it keeps shutting down as soon as I try to reply to a message. I have two phones and it's also done this on my other phone. Coincidence? I think not. Fix the issue!!

56,Bernard Londeix,"April 22, 2020",4, Good App but difficult to distinguish phone contacts from Skype only contacts. How to clean the results of action is tedious: to be cleaned one by one instead as a group. Otherwise I am happy with it.
57,Anjali Devi,"April 24, 2020",4, It si very good and it is easy to use but I am giving 4 star because I have a very high internet speed but it is showing poor network connection. Please try to solve it.
58,Aman Khatri,"April 17, 2020",3, A must feature should be a there to see who has muted your call. If skype don't want to give this so it can be like that only admin of call can see all activity. Because while taking Online classes some students misuse absence of this feature.

Hope this was helpful to you. In my opinion this app is EXCELLENT and OUTSTANDING!🤩👌"
64,M Carter,"April 22, 2020",4, Excellent for staying in touch with friends and family. Only downside is sometimes the sound goes out. But we usually just re-dial when that happens and everything is fine!
65,Bojan Land,"April 19, 2020",3," tedious interface, weird workflow when incorporating separate screen for sms and pots, too many screens for same contacts. no option to turn off constant sliding amd other annoying animated user interface elements. amazing emojis and gifs. no choice of presentation of text always like iChat."
66,Irfan khan,"April 23, 2020",1," Call to. Mobile from.skype subscription is very bad, I can't even here from other side, I feel I made a mistake buying this subscription. Simple my minutes get deducted without hearing single word from other side."
67,Vishwajeet Chaudhary,"April 23, 2020",4, Video calling quality is awesome ...just a few things which can be change is that the call should connect directly fir the first time ..not the links should come for invite otherwise the app is good i like it ....🙂🙂
68,Karina Alemania,"April 21, 2020",5, I like Skype so much because I've been using it for such a long time and I've never had any problems with this app it. It's very friendly and easy to use and it never crashes when making video calls.
69,ravi kumar,"April 19, 2020",3, Overall app is good...but the problem is that it's consumed more internet data in comparison of other video call app...plz fix the problem ..this is the only reason people are not installing this software ..
70,Jessi Calynn,"April 19, 2020",5," Very convenient. Maybe a couple times lost signal, but that was usually to do with the internet reception. I'm very satisfied though."
71,Sherry Lovegrove,"April 20, 2020",5, App installed easy. The call quality was excellent over a satellite connection. Calls ring into my cell phone so access to incoming calls is easy. A great app and service.
72,Hippa Lattamaus,"April 24, 2020",2, This app works great for awhile then there are so many glitches. Now the messages won't pop up notifications. This is why people are leaving this app for others.

74,Marius Cristian,"April 21, 2020",5," I had Skype before WhatsApp was even born and I also used it at work as well. It's still one of the best apps out there, but I don't really understand why the people just simply forgot about it."
75,Sumit Sondhwal,"April 21, 2020",5, Good application. Only one thing was missing that i can't see videos of all. There should be screen slide options when the person is speaking and other side we can see multiple videos in another slide.

97,hector 666,"April 17, 2020",3, Just one freaking problem..just one.. Why don't my phone or any other phone with latest Skype installed doesn't show any sign of calls or incoming messages.. My S8 doesn't ring or vibrate when the screen is off.. U guys can fix it ..do you..?

105,Shukla Chakraborty,"April 23, 2020",1, I have logged in with 4 account cause everytime it is logging me out... Why is this happening. For this app i am not able to study in my teacher's class. It's the worst video calling app ever it is not even a little bit user friendly 🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡
106,Avtar Kour,"April 24, 2020",3, This is good but sometimes voice can't reach. So you have to do more smoothness in this.
107,Babblesof theInsane,"April 23, 2020",2, Updated and now won't work. Only way to connect to hubby who is in Australia and I in America. Now we need to find another app. Disappointed.
108,mahi gupta,"April 17, 2020",5, It works very easily. The best feature of this app is video recording and automatic visible of video in the meeting group. Screenshot is visible by every member .
109,Subhankar Banik,"April 22, 2020",5, Nice app for online classes and video chat. Service is quite good. Many participants can be added as your wish. Really nice app.

On the phone directly with them, still unable to find them with the search feature. By Name, by email, by phone, or by the CID number, NOTHING brings up the person you're trying to find. The Invite a Friend option would work nicely if it did something more than send an email to the other person to invite them to download the app. No link or anything to then add the person that invited you. This app is VERY DIFFICULT and frustrating. Only worth the trouble right now in order to talk to isolated family members."
112,William Espinoza,"April 21, 2020",1, If you have multiple xbox live or Microsoft profiles due to having kids or multiple xbox systems forget about using Skype. The sign in process is a nightmare every time.

However, editing contacts is still a chore, and in places, impossible. And to top it all, on paid subscription, calling internationally sometimes charges way more than the posted rate, even when the connection fails to be established. With no accounting for it or billing. No summary after the call. It's a black hole for money, all you see is the charges."
114,Aladdin Alhaffar,"April 21, 2020",3, It should be able to work in split screen mode and the user interface should be simpler especially with the contacts in the dark mode
115,Yutagon,"April 23, 2020",1," Other side cant hear me at all, despite me saying the same thing countless times. Facebook messenger is so much better for trying to do calls over this."

A pop up error message suggests checking my internet connection but there is nothing wrong with my WIFI or Ethernet connections. I guess I'm going to be even more socially distant from my family than planned.
295,William Richard Frederick,"April 2, 2020",1, They have stolen my money. I've had Skype accounts for years. Now I just got forceably locked out. Sign in won't work anymore with my old login even though my password is correct. Tried to change my password but Skype rejected the change. Insanely stupid programers and/or common thieves. Shameless.

390,Sharon Smith,"March 29, 2020",2, The call was great but the app sucks. There are no controls for anything. Can't edit a contact. Can't delete a contact. Can't look up a contact etc. There is no settings feature. VERY POOR design. VERY user unfriendly. SUCKS!!!

499,Stefan,"March 31, 2020",5, One thing I have to say about this application that if it wasn't for so many years as an app we'd have terrible communication problems... For me it's by far the best
500,T E,"March 22, 2020",1, How many times do i have to tell the app that i don't want its idiotic drawing over the top of other apps. You've been told time and again to fix your app. Get on with it. Update March 2020 - Microsoft is still arrogant and idiotic. No surprise. Uninstalled.
501,Davide Lovato,"March 22, 2020",5," all is notably better than in the previous versions - well done Skype. The only thing I would remove is the camera bubble when the call is on the background, which I find annoying."
502,Charli Pons,"March 31, 2020",4," The app is fantastic but the battery consume is too exagerated, it gets more than 50% in just an hour because the torch ( idk why) is switched on automatically."
503,Dolores Vergabera,"April 4, 2020",5, Great app! Very good for calling and texting to phone numbers but too expensive. But it's nice..... Recommended for everyone.: )
504,deeptanshu middey,"April 22, 2020",5, Great call quality even in weak network connection. Thank you
505,Anon Ymous,"April 17, 2020",1, Should be able to install....WITHOUT having to give an app access to ALL my private contacts. Nope not using
506,Errol Feldman,"March 8, 2020",2, It constantly cuts out. Sound quality is sometimes like talking underwater. There is another much better now on the market I think that SKYPE is fooling around with the product too much.
507,Augustine Yeboah,"April 21, 2020",4, Great app by all standard. I enjoy using skype everyday due to the clarity of voice. Try it and you would love it.
508,Mark Anderson,"March 10, 2020",2, It is not updating with the latest messages that have been done on another Android or PC. Not syncing. It shows 127 unread items even though I have gone into that chat. Nor is it sending now. Android 5.1.1
509,Paul Hulbert,"March 8, 2020",1, Keeps on prattling about security. Don't you know its insecure to repeatedly ask for password? Then if I want to change security levels I have to login for the third time today. Load a waffle. I think it got confused when swapping sim in a dual dim phone. Controlmania.
510,Conan Forrester,"March 24, 2020",1," Useless. Unable to log in or create a new account. This is due to absolutely nothing coming up when it asks for region and date of birth, although why it needs DoB is still a mystery."
511,gaming nuggeys,"March 27, 2020",3," I have trouble connecting half the time and it feels clunky to use, so if any is wondering if they should get this, get discord it's better but I will still use Skype because one of friends refuses to switch to discord"
512,DBG,"April 11, 2020",2, App doesn't show any notifications. Even when in app notifications are all turned on as well as the phone notifications. Still doesn't work after uninstalling several times.
513,Nightmare Booda,"March 30, 2020",3, It's an amazing app but I rarely get the notifications which is quite annoying and often leaves an angry girlfriend on my hands. It would be awesome if that can be fixed. The notifications I mean
514,Priit Umbsaar,"April 1, 2020",5," Fantastic app, a true pioneer and a leader of global video calls! Others try to imitate, but there's only one Skype."
515,Christine POULTER,"April 14, 2020",5, I like it very much and used to be able to get in touch with my brother. I don't know why it will not work on my phone now. Living on Spain I like to keep in touch with family in UK. Can you tell me why I can't get Skype now? Thank you
516,Navneet Gautam,"April 23, 2020",5, Much better than other platforms. No disruptions
517,GOUTAM BHATNAGAR,"April 14, 2020",4," Not able to download recordings...the video plays just fine in the conversation but when I save it, it shows the size of the video as 0kb in gallery. Plz help."
518,Samriddha Singharoy,"April 10, 2020",5, The most advantageous as it separates private and public chat... Also has the facility of recording video calls... But there is no option for hiding private chats....
519,Job Kamau,"April 4, 2020",3, The video is quite okay during group video calls however the audio is really poor. Kindly improve on the quality of audio. Its really buffering.
520,Andrew Liberman,"April 9, 2020",2," Please, add annotation tools such as pens, whiteboard, text, etc. so that we could use Skype for teaching online. We need these features right now during these hard days."
521,Mr Toad,"April 24, 2020",2, Search doesnt work on chromebook. Nothing comes up at all. Apparently there are no people called 'John' on skype. Pointless
522,Sheri Olson,"March 15, 2020",4," I like the updates, except when I get a message from my friends I don't get a notification, either a sound, vibration or LED light, it also will say my friends haven't been on in days but I had chatted with them minutes ago. Can that be looked into. I have all notification set."
523,Hehee Brainboob,"April 2, 2020",5, I've always loved this app. I've experienced problems before but nothing that cant be easily fixed. Overall great app.

532,Chukwuma Nwokoma,"April 18, 2020",5, Cool app. The video conference experience was superb with the screen sharing feature and then again for free. I prefer it to Zoom.
533,Ionel Roman,"March 15, 2020",1," Not launching without Android System WebView. I have replaced the default WebView and none of the Skype clients are launching anymore. This is truly unacceptable, since the protocol is closed and there are no alternatives."
534,Diana Kinslow,"March 29, 2020",4," Usually very good. Sometimes minor problems, but not sure if it is Skype, internet, or computer. Im just happy to have this service!"
535,Samantha Pruitt,"April 4, 2020",5, Amazing features !!!!I I wish i could give you 10 stars i love this app the only thing i would change is a better package with more features in the 1 month free trial
536,HoneyBunch,"March 27, 2020",1," Bag of shite. Microsoft should be ashamed of what they've done to this service. Can't maintain a video link, or even start one. Learn a lesson from Zoom - which is twenty-fold superior to the car crash that is Skype"
537,pam armer,"April 11, 2020",3, I tried to use it once & call didn't go through. It could have been the other person's fault for not being able to get it set up right. We tried once and will try again sometime.

I am pissed off with this.. most of the time i have to disconnect and call again.. .."
541,Panagiotis Krystallidis,"March 18, 2020",4," Stable connection. But if you are in session with more than 4 people you can not see them all clearly.

559,Bobby K,"March 15, 2020",5," Skype has gone far since the humble beginnings. It used to be painful and patchy even with wired internet. Nowadays, even on my satellite wifi, no interruptions. Just the spying is scary (don't presume your messages are.all that private)."

I love this app because regardless of where they're at I get to see them, see them smile and hear them laugh. And that makes all the difference.

I'm paying a lot of money to be able to communicate with my family and all of a sudden no one finds a solution! If I could I would give Skype a -5 star rating. You'd better fix your act!"

A call comes through, and it's a crapshoot as to what sort of experience I'll get trying to answer. It will either be in walkie-talkie mode SCREAMING in my ear, or it might be at normal phone volume. Then good luck actually ending the call. Notifications come many minutes after a missed call, or you'll get missed call notifications hours after a successful call. The Skype service seems to have no way of knowing that I'm connected successfully on my PC version of Skype, and will begin ringing - notifying me of a call that I initiated and am currently engaged in. This frustrating experience resulted in this review, as well as me uninstalling the app."

Skype can save you literally thousands of dollars in roaming fees that you would otherwise pay if you used your US carrier overseas instead of Skype's Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

2278,Gary AP,"February 8, 2020",5, Solid performances as always. It amazes me that people use chat on iPhone and Android devices that exclude one another when Skype Does all the same things just as well and works on virtually every device and computer.

I was able to have video calls with Canada and the UK which were very high quality. This was on my Chromebook. Also tried another Skype call on my Android phone and it worked well, but there was reportedly some distortion of my voice on the other end; video from the UK was good quality and there was no audio distortion on my end.

Having said all that, I do very much like Skype's auto-ans"

It has permision to access my contacts but shows all the ppl in the world except the people who are actually in my phone directory. Another thing is that it takes money from my PayPal before my old subscription expires.So at the moment my old subscription expires on 17.1.Bt it deducts for new package on 14.1. and the new package isn't activated so why charge me before due date.

2497,Cynthia P,"December 5, 2019",5," I found the app to be accurate and clear when it comes to making phone calls and video chat I enjoy viewing the person that I am speaking with. When you see the person live, it's like the person is standing right in front of you. I give it's FIVE Star rating."

2500,David Stutzman,"November 13, 2019",1, The app is constantly bugging me to grant permission to draw over other apps. No means NO. It also randomly cuts off the endings of some messages... I'm not even sure how you can screw up a messaging app so badly that it doesn't even properly display the entire contents of a message
2501,Bassem Mardini,"December 9, 2019",5," Great for freecalls to the US & excellent rates for international calls.

2522,Amanda L,"December 14, 2019",1, Skype used to be really good. You used to be able to keep your conversation history forever. Now it is deleted and everything is lost. There are lots of apps that do the same thing in better ways without deleting all your conversation history.

2568,Keith Munn,"January 6, 2020",1," Always a poor network connection. Hangs up, freezes, sound is garbled. Took me 4 hours to have a 30 minute conversation. Because of all the freezing and connection issues. Wish it worked better"

Horrible to use and so many better options out there. What happened? Microsoft wrecks another property it seems

2598,Valdenilton Santos,"November 21, 2019",4, I Like it so much. I just would like to ask to see why is not possible to share the screen by Mobile. Because on Computer is possible but by Mobile isn't. But after all it's a great tool.

2631,yanne harrington Salomonsen,"January 9, 2020",1," No notifications although they are turned on in settings - that are impossibly difficult to find - you also cannot change the notification sound. Guys, I'm using Skype for work, this is creating problems for me."
2632,Puppy Productions,"December 28, 2019",4," This app works well I've had it a while but now when I try to send a picture a loading symbol pops up and it won't send and then everything I try to text after that won't go through either. Please fix this, though otherwise its a good app. 👍"

2635,daryl smith,"November 27, 2019",4," I found the app verry usefull for if let's say, a friend or relitive were to go on a trip.

2637,Dubz Consulting,"December 15, 2019",1," Just total rubbish. Disappearing credit, (why). The official end of skype for me. Loosing credit for no reason other than Microsoft want to rob me is just not good enough. Stay away or loose credit unless you use the app when microsoft tell you to."
2638,Briohny Kromo,"January 6, 2020",3," For some reason, instead of opening my gallery to select pictures, it opens files instead, which makes it annoying and laggy. It uses to when I first installed it, but then it stopped. Notifications don't show up too."

2640,Bill Brommeland,"January 18, 2020",1, Absolutely gone straight downhill used to be able to communicate with people I care about translator doesn't work and Skype is turned into nothing but malware and adware and everything else obviously they're more worried about selling than they are about actually providing Addison quality service
2641,Pascal Magero,"February 25, 2020",1, This app works fine but it does not always show new messages when they appear. I almost lost a client coz of this! 😕

2653,Sreeram TS,"November 26, 2019",5, From earlier I think the backend has improved a lot and it shows. The call quality is excellent for Skype to phone which is a huge plus for a platform like this. Have been using this to call multiple countries - and everything works exactly as advertised.
2654,Nitin Sidhu,"November 13, 2019",1," Not reliable. Does not always run in background. And none of my friends or family have found it usable, as unless active on both ends, cannot receive calls or texts. Multiple phones. Latest skype and Android versions."
2655,Macie Brooke,"November 16, 2019",1, I used Skype years ago so over that time I've forgotten all of the information needed to log on. After deciding to try it one more time I realize it's simply too ridiculous to try to navigate. Uninstalling and will never use again! Microsoft is just awful.
2656,billy GK,"November 7, 2019",1," As i see online MANY users have the same frustration. You cant have sound when a new message arrives. Neither when your device is on rest mode (screen off), nor when you are online. I would rate it with 0 stars if i could."
2657,Dean Fresonke,"December 1, 2019",1," Latest releases make it impossible to answer incoming calls. App rings with round circle flashing with incoming contacts name but there is no answer button. Only a red call hangup button. Come on Microsoft, how can this get through you quality control?"

2674,Cee Destor,"November 16, 2019",1," Can't even sign in and if you do, it will just load for so long you couldn't even check your messages. Ever since the update, the app sucks. Sigh, hoping it can be fix."

2682,Travis Gee,"January 28, 2020",2, Annoying demands to rate app every single bloody time you use it. Not as high quality as fb messenger with fewer features.

2704,Thomas Ward,"November 30, 2019",3," Rather like Longfellow's little girl, when it is good it is very good indeed, but when it is bad it is horrid. If Microsoft would just leave it alone, instead of tinkering with it continuously, it would be much better I think."

2706,Gagandeep Singh Sidhu,"January 11, 2020",4, The only problem in this app is sometimes it doesn't give you notifications for messages and the app will not work properly if network is weak( as compared to other messaging apps)
2707,huddled aroundthecampfire,"January 10, 2020",4, It's works really well you do not need a phone number you just need an email reason I only reason gave it four stars is because the person has to be on the app when you go to call him or her you can't just call
2708,Matt Carner,"December 13, 2019",1," Super buggy. I either don't get notifications for new messages at all, or I don't get them until much later. It's caused friends to think I was ignoring them. This just started with the most recent update."

2791,Joshua Ellison,"January 25, 2020",5," The app has been very useful for making international and local phone calls, for me, for over a decade. The costs are a lot more feasible than typical phone calls, in my experience."

2793,John Caldicott,"February 12, 2020",1, Great when it worked. Now it keeps stopping . This seems to be since the latest update on 17th January
2794,Mykola Dimura,"November 13, 2019",4," Lots of functions and they work better then in other Messengers, but the protocol is completely closed, privacy is questionable, and user interface is irritating."
2795,Yulia Blatter,"November 14, 2019",5, Skype is very convenient and user - friendly. I can always reach out to my family abroad when I need at affordable cost. I never had problems with this app and enjoy using it.
2796,dilip vijay,"April 8, 2020",2, cant get screen share option in chromebook
2797,Anca Maria,"January 11, 2020",1," We should have an option to disable ""last seen online"" feature. This is PRIVACY VIOLATION. It was possible a while ago, but not anymore. How come such stupid changes are forced down our throat?? This app got worse with every update."
2798,Objective is Better,"February 3, 2020",5, Mobile Skype covers all of the major functions (if not all) that I have found in the desktop version. A+!
2799,Maaz Amjad,"January 7, 2020",5, Sometimes it disconnects on giving it a four-star but it's a really good app and it's good quality but sometimes it really sucks if you're talking to a different country but overall it's actually really good because you're talkin to a different country disconnects sometimes

2816,John T Lounsbury,"January 3, 2020",1," Changed phones and my problems began. Forced me to change passwords three times, when finally in, they lost my history and my balance. Used Skype for years, but Microsoft has ruined it. I will never use again."
2817,Christian Herenz,"November 21, 2019",4," I would prefer if it better integrates with the phone book, i.e. that I can select from my phone book to route a call through Skype... The interface is also a bit messy."
2818,M Sana,"December 21, 2019",1, I called my parents on Skype for 30 mins. Surprise surprise...my battery drained from around 60% to 19%. I watch YouTube live for an hour and barely hit a 20% usage dip on my battery. This is not at all an app I can recommend for video chat.

2826,Takura Sibanda,"November 28, 2019",4, Skype has been a useful app to me over the years being able to call people over video to dialling landlines in other countries I'm happy I came across it when I most needed it. Thank you SKYPE
2827,Austin Cates,"December 9, 2019",5," The phone plan needs basic texting service included but other than that, good choice for VOIP line. $40 a year for unlimited U.S. calling I believe. Better line quality & reliability in my experience than Google Hangouts or Voice."
2828,Aiden Randall,"February 4, 2020",5, It's the best communication app because it has a lot of stuff you need to communicate with other people
2829,Lisa Luna,"January 11, 2020",1, Even with a great WIFI connection the video is unclear and freezes every few minutes. The person I communicate with reports same issues on his end. Never using Skype again.

2843,Nevaran,"December 21, 2019",1," Not even usable anymore since it keeps whining to change password more than once a year. Is your security that garbage that you want the users to keep refreshing new passwords, and even *still* keep the old ones in the database?"
2844,Ann D'Amour,"November 16, 2019",1, Hard to set up. There should be a warning that the code has several numbers. Should be made simpler for seniors. This is crazy!
2845,Inna Lyubovskaya,"December 1, 2019",2," Ever since last update the ""status"" is always automatically reverts to ""Active"" regardless how many times you switch it to ""Invisible"", ""Away"" or even ""Do not dusturb"". Definitely a new bug introduced."

2847,Shrey Chhabra,"December 1, 2019",3," There is a bug. Speaker gets activated at call end ( my side / opposite side ) and the call ends with a loud beep. It doesn't happen with Skype Lite only, the same issue is there in Skype preview aswell."

2850,Joanna Georgieva,"January 24, 2020",5, I like it very much but it stops recording the caller's voice after few calls. I have to delete it and install it again so it works. Why?
2851,Nick Masters,"January 25, 2020",4, Overall skype has gotten nice and stable and quite light as well. The only drawback i noticed is that it still takes a while to load when you re opening it.

2855,Cee Quizo,"February 28, 2020",1, I have a subscription and from the minute I signed on nothing has worked. I can't make calls; all I guess is oops sorry. Customer service is impossible to reach. This is bad for business.

If you delete the Contact, the old Contact and Dangerous link stays on your device. I ask you, what gives them the RIGHT to do this, and exert this level of control? This can cause huge mental trauma, most people will want the right to delete this (And any other) content, out of their life and be gone with it. You have to ask why are they allowed to take this control away from the user? Surveillance Society? I recommend Skype/Microsoft are held to account!

5075,STUDENT MOM,"April 24, 2020",5, This app is pretty cool! It lets you do video chats and make phone calls. You can also record your video chats. Group chats are also available. Skype is better than WhatsApp. Highly recommended!
5076,Richard Funke,"December 6, 2019",3, Skype keeps randomly hanging up whenever my gf and I call you guys need to fix this because it's getting really annoying

Instead of making a good quality product they make it as hard as possible to cancel in the hopes that people will give up and just keep paying the subscription fee. Tried to cancel but they hide the cancel option. Help was no help of course. You would think it would be under your account. Dirty tactics !
5081,michael borromeo,"April 7, 2020",1, I'm always online to check messages but after a few days past that's the only time i received a message that was sent 3 days ago. No notification or emails about the msgs. It's a great inconvenience.

5087,Raheela Aslam,"March 30, 2020",1, Its a worse day when microsoft took this app under their custody.
