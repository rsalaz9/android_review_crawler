At first you are wowed by it, but after a while you realize there isn't much ""there"" there. You improve your team, but with your league resetting after every season, you soon realize you are on a treadmill. The AI will *always* make sure the competition is stiff enough to give you an intensive to spend money and upgrade, but also not so discouraging to make you actually quit. Get ready for a lot of 10 - 6 or 11 and 5 seasons."
1,christian cook,"April 23, 2020",5, Great theme gives a real sense of nfl from this era and others. User friendly app... allows your football knowledge to be rewarded. Great game apps from CBS sports. This is an older version.
2,Justin Genovate,"March 2, 2020",2," Amazing game but, I found a glitch in seasons where it says I win but suddenly it says I lost. Seriously please fix this glitch so I can rate this game higher. This glitch also caused me two franchise bowls."

It's hard to know how successful your individual plays are working. I think there are improvements to be made in every area. Once they do this game will be a master piece. Overall this is the best sports simulator I've played.
5,Zander Thomas,"July 8, 2019",4," Cool game. I didn't want a lot of gameday interaction, but I did want to call the plays during games. Everything else is what I expected.

I was doing great at first, now I've replayed level 30 dozens of times because it refuses to let me win in the playoffs anymore. Im losing to teams I'm much better than. Once you complete all the season level goals,, it forces you to advance to next level. But for some reason, teams that I lost to in the championship keep showing up on my level 30... season after season. BS game!! Don't bother 👎"

However, the game unnecessarily limits how often you can play to encourage you to spend money in the app. This isn't really designed to be a game, it's designed to get you hooked and then frustrated so you spend money. If they remove in-app purchases this will become a 5 star rating but until then, it is 1 star."
8,Adsjtle Binggeli,"February 19, 2020",4, This game is so much fun! Even though you aren't controlling the players. Always my first choice!
9,Jake Bushlack,"January 6, 2019",3," Fun game but crashes a lot. I have 2 problems with the gameplay: You can only put a player in your lineup when you open it in the pack. If the player isn't immediately set as a starter, he can't later be started. If you take him out of the starting lineup, he can't be returned to the starting lineup...Full ReviewFun game but crashes a lot. I have 2 problems with the gameplay: You can only put a player in your lineup when you open it in the pack. If the player isn't immediately set as a starter, he can't later be started. If you take him out of the starting lineup, he can't be returned to the starting lineup. The other problem is similar. Unlike the offensive playbook, if a play is replaced in the defensive playbook, it disappears and cannot be reused."
10,Billy VanDahm,"June 6, 2019",2, I had been playing the app for a week. Made it up to level 11 with some good historical players. Today I opened the app and it had no record of my team and made me sign up again. Back up to level 5 but very frustrated. Yes I used the same log in. It just kept telling me to create a new team.

Back up to level 5 but very frustrated. Yes I used the same log in. It just kept telling me to create a new team. I lost some good players
11,Steve Higley,"August 23, 2019",4," Not sure about the best way to play, learning game mechanics takes some time but seeing old and current players is fun. Team did well at first but has faded.

Team did well at first but has faded. I wish you could play faster but that is one way to get you to pay real money. This is definitely a game that you can spend money and get better fast, like real life MLB."
12,David Scearce,"July 5, 2019",5, I absolutely love this game and the only thing I don't like is you have to wait 15 hours or so after the season to play the playoffs unless you have a ticket thing but that's because I'm impatient and want to keep playing lol. if it wasn't for that I would play from the time I woke up until I fell a...Full ReviewI absolutely love this game and the only thing I don't like is you have to wait 15 hours or so after the season to play the playoffs unless you have a ticket thing but that's because I'm impatient and want to keep playing lol. if it wasn't for that I would play from the time I woke up until I fell asleep from playing. thanks for making a very great football game
13,William and Chissie Mlotok,"December 23, 2018",4," I enjoy playing the game, although you don't see the action (the games are simulated), you do draft, sign, build a playbook and manage the team. I haven't made any purchases, so I'm trying to do it the hard way. it's worth a try, if you like football."
14,Chase Larkin,"January 7, 2019",1, I am just started out like a day ago and already have a weak team and have some good players and now they will lose their training points automatically and there is no point to play the game if it takes for ever in season mode and to get players and on top of that it is already going to automaticall...Full ReviewI am just started out like a day ago and already have a weak team and have some good players and now they will lose their training points automatically and there is no point to play the game if it takes for ever in season mode and to get players and on top of that it is already going to automatically rest the players training points. The game is trash and needs to be better than it is now. I am done playing the game.
15,Finn Crawford,"December 15, 2019",1, This game is completely rigged no doubt about it! Balance does not even exist I've been stuck on the same season for 3 days and it's just stupid. Fix your damn matchmaking
16,James Thomas,"September 6, 2019",1, WHAT A SCAM....everytime there is a season ticket available u get screwed...latest example: Defender needs 70 tackles for season ticket....2 players finished with 69 and 67 tackles...and thats playing 16 games and playoffs....nevermind that every other season u will have multiple players with over 7...Full ReviewWHAT A SCAM....everytime there is a season ticket available u get screwed...latest example: Defender needs 70 tackles for season ticket....2 players finished with 69 and 67 tackles...and thats playing 16 games and playoffs....nevermind that every other season u will have multiple players with over 70 tackles but once that ticket comes up for grabs ur screwed....it happens WAY TOO OFTEN...happens when legend coins are up for grabs too...im about to start takin screenshots and posting them
17,Edward J. Pilderian,"March 6, 2019",1," Was ok at best but then I was tricked into making a purchase by misleading advertising to improve ""my players"" paid to improve player I didn't have with makes no sense. Have to spend too much money to advance more than terribly slowly. If you don't have any paint to watch dry this game is for you."
18,Skip Brott,"November 19, 2019",3, I'm enjoying the game to an extent but where are defensive plays? I've got slots open but the only available play is the one stock generic play for defense...
19,Andrew Rice,"March 23, 2019",3, not a bad game BUT it is slllllooowwww moving unless u want to spend money. and not that I would buy anything bc I don't spend money on games but the prices r really high. I've almost uninstalled many times bc it just takes so long to do anything. speed it up without money and it'd be 4+ stars
20,John Garland,"September 28, 2019",2," My old review was 4 stars now 2 due to showdown mode. The ratings don't add up to who you play, I'm currently only 180 overall going up against a guy who is over 1000. I'm in season 30 he is in 103, instead of going off ratings, how about basing it on a season level, like 0-50, 50-100 and so on and ...Full ReviewMy old review was 4 stars now 2 due to showdown mode.

21,Bobby Morgan,"October 12, 2018",4, Its the best football simulation game out there. You can add historical players to your team earn lots of bonuses train your players. Plenty of options to tweak your team from players to playbook. As always there is room for improvement and maybe some new game simulation options would be cool
22,A Google user,"September 16, 2018",4, Many changes in game play once it started. Most without notice. Sucks when you plan on how to build team and you spend months doing it and they change game play. Happened times of major impact.
23,Blake Williams,"January 22, 2020",4, This game is really good its just the part when you have to wait 15 hours and other time it is stupid
24,Dustin Wendegatz,"October 15, 2018",4, It's pretty good. Gotta pay to win right around level 15 in my opinion. Sucks how long it takes to get tickets. Gonna be 5 years till I reach level 30
25,Vladivostok,"November 15, 2019",5, I enjoy playing this game but I just wish that it is much easier to get ultimate players...
26,Darius Ley,"March 10, 2019",4," Good franchise game that needs little time put in to play, can open the game maybe 2 to 4 times a day and spend 5 minutes playing. As of late though there is a bug where showdown is not opening and gets stuck on loading."
27,rob neal,"February 11, 2019",2, great game too bad screen is cut off on my lg g7 and i cant access some of the buttons or see some of the screen. If this gets fixed i will definately spend more time on this game!!!!
28,Chris Kerlish,"September 9, 2019",5," Still a great game, better even than the newer version. My only irritation is an unrealistic bias towards good, but not great, more modern teams (e.g. 2014 Seahawks) that are roadblocks in the pro and legend pro games. Lots of fun otherwise..."
29,Junior Harris,"December 9, 2018",4," It's great for people who like to build teams, although the hours of waiting for energy to refill or for the playoffs to begin is mad annoying. Easily forgettable"
30,Larry Davis,"August 1, 2019",5, This game did start off slow at first ..but after playing for a while i think this game is amazing . it doesnt rob you like most pay to play game and to be honest i like the simulated gameplay more than i realized
31,Mike Miller,"December 28, 2019",3, Takes way to long in-between seasons. Play for a few minutes then have to wait 10 hrs to really do anything
32,Anthony LaBona,"January 24, 2020",5, Love this app! Great way to pass the time and rule my own football universe
33,dylan teets,"December 6, 2018",5," This game is awesome, you can sign old players and new players and take control of the playbook. Cool game"
34,Phonesai Phachanh,"March 14, 2020",3, Its a good game to a degree. jus wish it didnt take 14 hours to start a seasonal game
35,Dave Gilson,"December 5, 2019",3, Improvements could be made especially music or ways to get better rewards
36,Bama Brick,"February 19, 2020",4, Should be able to watch ads for more game matches
37,Don Sullivan,"May 13, 2019",1," App has trouble opening, when it does, it doesn't link to the existing account. It appears to be getting buggier."
38,A Google user,"February 27, 2019",4, Great Game just wish you could get more chances to win tickets and tokens.
39,Jack the Ripper 76,"January 25, 2019",3," like the game, need a patch! i got a new phone (umidigi a3 pro) and the buttons to choose on the training session screen are cut off, i cant choose any of them!"
40,Kllen,"August 15, 2019",5," Good enjoyable solo game, great graphics with easy to understand and play, controls are really simple to use"
41,steelers fan19,"November 28, 2019",4, i like the game but i dont want to wait 15 hours to play aplayoff game but i also would love for you to update the rosters with the current player like patrick mahomes but overall a good game

46,Ron Povey,"January 1, 2019",4," Decent manager game, only downside is the wait for timers on playoffs and training etc.. Otherwise might be 5 stars"
47,Jake V,"July 7, 2019",1," Uses players from 15 years ago, no actual gameplay, and extremely slow progression unless you spend money."
48,Paul Jacquard,"October 6, 2019",5, Very easy to navigate and very understandable good gameplay.
49,Agnes Olatide,"March 8, 2020",5, I like the game my only problem is that it uses data pls cbs fix it
50,Robert Monds,"May 9, 2019",5, can take a bit of time to build in game funds but overall a good sim experience
51,Michael Sabel,"June 3, 2019",4, great game but the wait for completing a season can get long
52,Bobby Mollett,"April 9, 2019",4, fun to build team quick season play takes to long to be able to finish season like a 11 hr timer only problem I see
53,Tanker3278,"September 6, 2019",5," Fun game for building dynasties, but statistical model needs corrected."
54,Chunk Norris,"February 14, 2019",5," fun, manager style game, nice variety to keep it interesting"

Not sure if my purcases will be restored or refunded. Good game with numerous pay to get ahead options.  Game has expanded since I joined, with addition of extra pro games and points for showdowns; and equipment to improve your players stats.

Just enough depth and complexity to keep me engaged."

201,Champion Red,"September 4, 2018",4," Only thing preventing 5 is waiting between seasons. I'd rather have no exhibition and just have seasons back to back. Or if we wait, unlimited exhibition between seasons."

203,Frank Rotella,"January 3, 2017",5," Great game if you don't always have a lot of time. All games are simulated. Ultimate players are challenging, but not impossible to get. I had an issue, and customer service responded and resolved it quickly."

Only flaw is the excessive wait times in between the end of the regular season and the start off the play offs, as well as the ridiculous wait times for the ""Pro"" games, where your created team squares off against historic teams. I see no reason for the wait times to be as damn long as they are, and can understand the frustration some have shared, and ultimately end up deleting the app. I'm not there yet, but it does hinder me from enjoying myself sometimes, when I just wanna immerse myself in the game the developers at CBS Interactive have created."

Otherwise it can get boring. It turns into a game you jump onto for a few minutes to run your drives and you're done for the day.    Maybe some unique weekly events and the weekly bundle needs different levels not just a single $15 dollar option.    How about once a week a $1 dollar special for a random 20 OVR player?  Or throughout the day a specific play gets a 50% discount because it was the most used the previous day?  Can the Arctic Blast section be renewed more often, possibly once a month and kept active throughout the month?  (New Years event/section/players for January, Valentine's event/section/players for February, etc.)  I'm still very new to the game, but I imagine the content gets better as I level up.  Thanks for developing this type of game though. It does help keep me busy for a few minutes while I'm done with Madden Mobile. Maybe with a few changes/updates it'll be worth spending real money on to get the franchise and players updated."

The best things that entertain rarely are free and Madden or even the older NFL Head Coach (one you play, one you mostly sim) cost money.  As for winning only if you pay, far from true. I am almost 100-2 and havent spent a cent.  Learn the game, dont just buy a player cause you like him in real life. What is his awareness? Do you have default running plays only yet you spend all your money on wide receivers?"

767,Matthew Jones,"September 13, 2016",4,Football lovers dream game So sweet being able to build a franchise like this game does.  App needs more customization of team look and logo. Several players are incredibility and incorrectly scored for abilities. Wish more time was put into making more accurate.
768,Danny Calkins,"October 19, 2016",4, It's fun to start but later the grind takes forever. Have to wait way too long for next step type things. Makes me forget about the game in between waiting game periods
769,Rook Cobalt,"September 2, 2016",1,"No strategy except paying The game deceives you by letting you buy plays and earn more playbook slots to make you think that ""strategy"" will help you win games. The only thing that matters is shelling out money to get higher powered players."
770,Nicholas Guy,"September 21, 2016",4, Good game but hard on mobile users. Needs more in depth game break down for mobile. It's very hard to game plan when you don't know what plays wee ran or what is and isn't working.  Those statistics are viewable through the facebook on pc bit not mobile.
771,Kevin Stutsman,"October 18, 2016",4,"It's OK! Fun when it works right. It often reverts to the beginning and I have to uninstall it. Also, I have to power off my phone to get out of the app. Other wise, no problem😉"

776,Michael Dineen,"August 21, 2016",4, Would be a five if it wasn't for the 15+ hours it takes between seasons.  New update makes it better as well. Eventually you level out unless you spend $$$ but new update helps this.

Although no matter how many games I win I don't receive my tranny sessions. I get everything else; tokens, franchise coins, money, RP coins but not the training sessions.

Would love to see the same thing with college football and recruiting. I think there could be a little more in terms of the games you play and strategy - instead of just a straight Sim, make it so that you can choose plays at key intervals of the game... or at least be able to choose an aggressive, defensive, or other type of strategy before the game and let that have some small effect on the outcome."

They want you to drop all these coins into players. I do not like how they determine who wins the games. You can be the better team and win two games out of 16. Also they do not pit you against teams that are close to your level. They put you against these uber teams that they know you will lose against. It's hard enough to make the playoffs as it is...to get through the playoffs is basically  impossible. The odds are rigged
889,David Trestrail,"April 29, 2016",4,Really fun but.... Fun game but the achievements are ridiculously low. Some take forever to get to and offers tiny rewards. Being heavily favored in season games and constantly getting beat gets old after a while. Fun game but like I said... Has two flaws.

And by the way,(this is intended for the creators of the game), pay NO attention to the people that seem to have nothing better to do than complain about a GAME that is, for the most part, FREE! Get a life guys..."
891,DM Pelley,"June 4, 2016",4,"Limited edition whaaaat? Great game, but two thoughts. Showdown is useless without any rewards, seems like just an afterthought. Also, limited edition players cannot be sold or dropped which really puts a crimp in the coin bank. Even if they were worth some RP would be a plus."
892,Andrew Petrina,"March 16, 2016",4,Fun but a long wait I like the game but the wait times between seasons is brutally long. The Coins are very expensive to buy.  Should be 10 for $5 or in that range. Overall gameplay is fun and I am hooked but won't spend any more money.

The next season the teams were still better, they increased by 50% as well.  No benefit from buying better players.  Game is a rip off and designed to hold you back wven when you give them money."
894,Eric Kleiner,"April 25, 2016",4,Game is good... ...but it ain't so GREAT that I want to drop money it.  Frustrating when you have to wait 18 hrs to play in the playoffs after the regular season.  Big turn off.
895,Matt Bishoff,"July 12, 2016",2,"Way over complicated Too much going on here wen it could be way simpler. Also it locks up frequently, just ain't worth it."

897,Chip Sedory,"May 24, 2016",4,Fun sim but pay 4 play built in. So you can play this game without paying any money.  However like most games these days the goal is to get you to spend money for better stuff.    It is a reasonable sim that gives you a ton of players you know but to get really good ones you gotta buy packs.
898,Sean Small,"April 28, 2016",2,Good but dont waste your time Stay away!

Game is very fun and addicting however if you dont spend real money you only can play for a few minutes at a time throughout the day. I like the game so much i wanted to keep playing so I spent money. A month and a half later I totaled up everything ive spent and its almost $300!!! I could have bought a brand new ps3 for that price. Also my team still isnt that good. Usually takes me 3 seasons to advance one level and you only get one season every 15 hrs unless you pay $7 dollars for 3 seasons.
899,Rhiannon Carringer,"May 22, 2016",5,Loved it but.... Could do without the showdown. That's it. Don't really wanna wait 15 hours for the next season but probably good or I would never stop playing!!! Only game of its kind!!!
900,Joseph Dinero,"April 11, 2016",5,"Nice work Great simulator. Easy to get things done and upgrade. Slight learning curve, but after that, smooth sailing. Definitely set up to benefit active players. Love the variety of players you can add :)"
901,A.J. Gabriel,"August 13, 2016",4,Good but.... Waiting Time is Too Longgg This game is deserving of five stars but the waiting time for these games take forever. 15+ hours for a League Ending//Playoff Start... Really.
902,Solomon Okoronkwo,"June 28, 2016",3,Good game only thing that sucks... The only thing that sucks is having to wait 14hrs to play the playoffs or paying $7. That's ridiculous. I get that its CBS and you're all about your money but that honestly takes the fun away from the game.
903,Chris Tolliver,"April 13, 2016",4,"Great football manager Minor bugs with game rewards, good game anyway.. getting a new bug where it split screens the game and I can't do anything, killing the app and restart does nothing"
904,Chris Hysek,"July 11, 2016",4,"Not perfect but fun Overall fun, and the app has some better/additional features than the web version. A bit clunky here and there (would prefer if it saved logon info), but no real complaints."
905,jonathan mcmillen,"March 12, 2016",4,"Ok game I just tried to sign a kicker to my team and first off on the roster they are listed under offense but when you go to buy one they are under defence. But the main problem is the game took my money but didn't give me a kicker! Also, it makes you wait to long in my opinion to play in the play-offs."
906,Tevin Clark,"June 1, 2016",3,To expensive Crazy that u charge $7 for three seasons overall good game but prices are way to high
907,Mike Dirienzo,"March 19, 2016",3,Almost Great The only reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is because of how stupid long it takes to finish a season. The timer is ridiculous. At change it to 12 hours instead of 15. Then it would deserve 5 stars.
908,Adam Sheamer,"March 29, 2016",1,I used to love it For some reason after update it wont let me play the games in the reg. season or playoffs...it just keeps loading and nothing happens. Frustrated because  I really liked game until update
909,Tracey Johnson,"April 23, 2016",4," Love the game.  Hate the 15 hour wait period.  I find that I spend a lot money on this simulation game and have had issues with the mobile game when the season is finished (the 15 hour wait), but I had to purchase season tix if I wanted to continue."
910,Justin Wooten,"June 28, 2016",1,Stealing my money! I've spent my own money for cash to sign players. I've attempted to sign 10 different players and not once had once shown up on my team. I've spent my real money on this anf just wasted it!

915,zeusgoesrawr,"June 10, 2016",1,ITS PAY TO WIN. FREE TO LOSE. Once you get close to level 25 you'll lose a ton and never win exhibitions or make the playoffs unless you pay to get better players as their rewards are miniscule and would take weeks just to earn enough to get a single player.

Sometimes it's instant with some things, and then again those are few and far between. Overall, I enjoy it, and wish there was a more sustainable playing style to it, daily achievements, bonuses, discounted player costs promos. Things that would give more back to the fan. This would promote more people paying more, getting good deals and surprises!!"
917,Simon Geller,"June 13, 2016",5, Really good game. Team management has a lot of depth. Only issue is the fact you have to wait 15h between seasons but other than that its a great game

I made the foolish mistake of purchasing all 10 Super Human players then did the same thing with 10 Yellow Jacket players. I figured, wow with that many players I should gain a big advantage for a while. How long did my advantage last? About 5 minutes...yeah. After I finished the season I was playing, the AI automatically adjusted the competition to be up to my current level. Basically making my purchase completely valueless. I don't mind a little competition, but if I pay good money to get a leg up on the competition, I expect that leg up to be worthwhile, not immediately be negated. Thanks for ruining my experience and stealing my money."
920,J Florsheim,"July 9, 2016",4,Really Enjoy It But gets really hard to improve your team once in Legend mode as those coins are extremely hard to come by. And definitely takes way too long between seasons without tokens.
921,Mekel Sanchez,"June 29, 2016",2," Glitches all the time, I would buy several players, when I went to put them in the starting lineup they'd go in and I'd sell the previous player at the position but only to find out the expensive player I bought got sold and not the crappy one I had before."
922,Jon Robt Brehmer,"March 14, 2016",4,Fun Good time killer. Not many football manager games out there. This one is tops. Only downside is the time you have to wait between seasons.
923,William Bristow,"April 28, 2016",4," Very fun app, just like the hockey and baseball versions on this! Hoping for the basketball (and if they have a soccer one too) to become apps also. Only downside is I hope the Limited Edition players rotate like on the hockey app so everyone gets a chance to get them from time to time!"

Its ridiculous and the game is now just turning into a joke for me its more of a why bother not a must play.

956,Gavin M,"May 13, 2016",4,Great game but... Daily bonus free picks are fixed on the phone app version. You think it's random but the game chooses what bonus is revealed. Otherwise it's an excellant game.

958,Kevin Clements,"June 10, 2016",3,Not bad. Madden is still far better than this game. You can't actually play a game. It is all simulated. I was very excited for a franchise/owner/gm type of game but it takes too long to earn enough cash to sign people. Definitely pay to win after level 5.

1283,Matt Bergmann,"March 2, 2016",4,"Seasons Great game, but it takes way to long after the season ends to start the playoffs.  It needs to be shortened so you can play more than 1 season a day.   Besides that the game is great.  If that improves it gets 5 stars."

You have to win and keep progressing to make Coins, Cash and RPs which you need to sign and train players, buy plays and get bonuses.  In the other games you can keep drafting if you get stuck.  Here it takes forever, and a lot of luck, to keep advancing in the same situation.  Otherwise, it's pretty good and keeps me interested."

1347,Kevin R Cook 67,"January 10, 2018",1, Game only chooses default plays that cannot be unlocked. Completely ignores user plays in playbook. This is so obviously done intentionally by makers of game in an attempt to force you to spend money because you cannot beat teams you should easily win against. Nothing short of extortion.
