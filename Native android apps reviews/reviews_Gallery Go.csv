When I went to Settings to try to sort it out, I noticed the Dark Mode switch was off. It's always been on Dark since I set it ages ago when I first installed. It's still on Dark now but the switch isn't. I don't auto update so I'd know if it was an update that screwed this up. I don't recall updating the app so I assume it just decided to misbehave."

It is very easy to use app. I have a suggestion for your technical support team that add some features like show duplicate file and large file as well.

I want to select multiple images or any image folder for make a theme for my mobile which is automatically change.

4,Miles Whittaker,"April 21, 2020",2, Works for viewing images from the camera app. Using it to browse photos on your device tho is severely lacking. Does not honor .nomedia files. Can only sort top-level folders. Can't sort photos at all. The last items in the list are always partially covered by the bottom navbar. Really Google?

It only leaves me wondering why the app falls short on on many different levels. Poor Google Photos integration, limited setting options, lacking in-app photo editor, I have yet to see the matching faces mechanic work. It seems like this app was rushed, thrown together and rushed into the marketplace it has so much potential and yet fails to impress."

What I feel is this app should include protection features like fingerprint unlock and hiding files. The app doesnt allow to delete multiple folders. The app doesnt show any option to select third party app for playing videos. I hope the developers will look for giving better updates.

Google Photos is the ultimate Photo app, but the simple interface of Gallery Go coupled with the app showing only the stuff you currently have on device makes this a valuable media manager."

In fact, the moment I scroll passed the folder where this certain video is stored, the app will immediately close, and this made me temporarily change to my device's default gallery app. Other than that, it has a really nice design, but it definitely lacks many features present in Google Photos ‚Äî I hope all of this gets fixed."
9,Patrick Stambaugh,"April 10, 2020",4, Seems to be a nicer spin off the traditional Photos application by Google. Perhaps they're seeking to phase out the old and in with the new? I also like how they've integrated additional functionality through Lens and other Gapps... It will probably only get better from here. A- for now.
10,nitin suresh,"April 17, 2020",1, If I could leave zero stars on playstore I would. Seriously I don't understand you people. You made a gallery app that's slower than a snail??

You made a gallery app that's slower than a snail?? It takes ages to find images on the phone. What use is such an app if it doesn't even get the basics right? Learn something from the GoPro video editing app.it was just like you. But now the app finds images and videos faster
11,Rachel C.,"April 12, 2020",3," It's okay, but why can't you sort the folders by name? Why can't you sort them so it's a single file listing straight down? Why are there no options to decide what folders to include? These aren't complicated features."
12,Erik Ross,"April 2, 2020",5," I like this app, simple to use, simple and user friendly design, NO ADS (which is hard to find for a gallery app), the perfect Gallery App! Google finally added the ability to sort the folders/albums by their name, which was the only flaw this app had. Highly recommend!!"

The app is very slow in accessing pictures and transferring picture one folder to another is also most of times takes more time like YouTube videos loading . I wonder why google go app takes this much time to transfer pics from one picture to another . I can watch one you tube video for three minutes and then also most of the times it was not completing the transfer task. Deleting picture also takes more time what is happening with Google ???
17,SAUMYA RANJAN SATRUSAL,"April 8, 2020",4," An efficient alternative for inbuilt gallery app which I was not able to use due to applock password which I had forgotten..now I can access to my photos in the same manner as it was in my previous gallery...happyüòä... Just one suggestion, if You could change the icon of app to a new one.."
18,Hawka,"January 29, 2020",3," Nice design, but lacks a lot of basic features. I cannot seem to rename files or folders in the app, nor can I re-sort anything alphabetically / descending. Other than that it looks well designed, and the photo editing that it offers is pretty nice too."
19,Ferdinand Jonathan,"February 5, 2020",5," just what I've been looking for. Please add scroll bar and grid zoom function so users can find photos they're looking for way easier and faster.. and that's gonna be perfect.. Overall, it's a good app for those who have been looking for a ""just"" gallery app that's lightweight and offline.."
20,Aim Ami,"April 9, 2020",3," This app is ok but it's slow. When i capture or download new picture/video, i must wait like 10 seconds for the new picture/video appear in gallery. Then, moving or copying picture/video is also slowüôÉ"

27,Aryan Onkar,"April 23, 2020",3, Delete and discard changes confirmation dialogs look a little bit weird. If possible please redesign them to look similar to the confirmation dialogs of Google Files or Google Photos App or some other google app.
28,Madhvendra Singh,"April 25, 2020",1, There is no select option for the album or folder. I cant delete the folders and its content in one click. When you add this i would love to change the 5 star rating for sure. Love you for tez gpay and google chrome.
29,Agathos Daimon,"April 10, 2020",4, Love the app. Better than the stock gallery app. Only missing the 5th star as it crashes if you have a large video file (15 mins or more)
30,Cresentia RaRa,"February 16, 2020",4, i like it. clean and simple. but it will be better if u add : 1. option to zoom in/out the roll 2. opt to move pic to other folder 3. opt to choose multiple photos by longpress and slide 4. quick delete by zooming out a full screen pict then slide down
31,Christian Homberg,"April 8, 2020",4," Great app, super fast, webc support. Only wish: more filter options, especially by date (year, month). Only problem I have when using it with 14,000 pictures from 7+ years."
32,shiftew leite,"March 18, 2020",1," How did this app pass Google's QC? This app is so slow, takes ages accessing media and sorting folders. Lacks basic functionality like playing videos while sorting OR sorting the entire folder media by size,time etc. The main gripe is how slow it is."
33,Mark Stephen Valles,"February 23, 2020",3," Unable to move photos to external sd card, but in external to internal, it only make a copy but leaves the original photo from the original folder from external, unable to delete external photos....

35,Harjasjeet Singh,"March 3, 2020",1," Very limited features, totally basic app No option to - sort folders/files, view cloud photos, change view type, slideshow and many more handy features often available in other apps. Expecting Google to make it somewhat useful."
36,G Samuel S Dewa,"March 11, 2020",5," The only thing missing is a more comprehensive editing ability within the app itself, more like Google photos otherwise it's a standard gallery the simplicity of which is very important."
37,Dwain Wuerfel,"April 24, 2020",3, I just downloaded this application and it doesn't have the same photos which appear in the Photos application. Does it only show those photos you have on your phone or take time to sync?
38,David Smith,"April 10, 2020",5, Way way better than Google Photos.. it actually works!! Highly recommended as an alternative if you need a lighter version of Photos.

48,‚Ä¢ Slayer ‚Ä¢,"March 20, 2020",1, Stop forcing dark mode. Not everyone likes dark mode. Give users the option to switch to light theme irrespective of device's dark mode being on/off. And also provide an option to turn off grouping pictures. Most of the auto grouped pictures are irrelevant.

61,Kaio Henrique,"February 4, 2020",5," Nice.

252,Roke Beedell,"January 22, 2020",3," Would be nice to be able to filter out RAW, duplicate files. It would also be nice to zoom‚Äîoften, for people who take many images, that sort of granular control is utterly necessary. I would also love to see this application support Android 7.x versions."
253,Francois Souyri,"January 8, 2020",3," Am really trying.. But I still don't see the point of this app. I thought it was to show Google photos but it only show me my local phone pictures, what's the point if there is nothing better than my android photo app already?

260,Gabriel Ilas,"January 19, 2020",4," Nice simple gallery app and it's clean. My only complaint is that when I go to my camera album when zooming in the picture it's unresponsive and laggy as hell, while, when it comes to other albums it's perfectly fine and no problem."

262,Salahuddin Vahed,"December 26, 2019",1, Extremely slow! Takes ages for it to load and each folder takes ages to load. Ashame as it's a very well designed app. Also needs more sorting features like selecting cover images and moving multiple images. Get the speed and features fixed!
263,Daniel Zormelo,"January 21, 2020",5," The gallery is awesome, can't explain how useful it has been to me. My humble suggestion: To make the gallery more extra ordinary I think a recycle bin need to be added to recover an unintentional deleted photo or video."

266,Clint Mayer,"November 18, 2019",3," Seems impossible to get camera app to open this as default gallery. Google Photos can't be uninstalled and it has defaults that can't be removed. Seems a bit crooked, Google. Also has an issue with importing photos in Concur expense app."
267,Vignesh Dulhipati,"November 22, 2019",1," Not such a good app from Google. Takes several minutes to load photos or folders. Open this app and keep your phone aside, go get some coffee and be back after a break. Who knows it might still be loading. So disappointed."
268,Cameron Schenkenberger,"December 2, 2019",4," It's pretty good, but when you're cropping photos, it does this weird snapping thing where it tries to snap into place in certain areas but usually just ends up not being where I need it to go."

277,Kylo Renessa,"December 31, 2019",3, I understand that this is a 'lite' version but it needs just a BIT more. Resolution options when cropping a photo! And choosing what order to sort my albums in. That's all I'm asking for.

280,Jill Lesoing,"January 8, 2020",2, Way too simplistic. Amongst many other things I don't like that you can't merge similar faces together nor label them with a name. I already use 3 other photo apps that are far better than this and will be uninstalling it.
281,Shyam krishnan,"November 16, 2019",1," (1)no bin in gallery like Google photos (2)photo editing only include cropping and filter,rotate more improvement shoud be made (3)should add more features like Google photos"

283,Shawn Jannasch,"January 14, 2020",2, Needs to have the ability to 1. select folders move/delete & 2. rename existing folders. I find it hard to believe Google didn't include something so vitally important for ANY gallery app. üòï

I mean seriously, loading every icon and app image from the OS apps data store? Was anyone in charge of this project or was it just a bunch of monkeys at keyboards?

801,Etienne Theron,"August 2, 2019",2," It's clean and fast but it merges the ""Archived"" photos from Google Photos into your main gallery which makes it kinda unusable if you use that feature to manage photos."
802,raazkalra kalra,"August 6, 2019",5, waiting for this app for a long time as My asus phone doesnt have a default gallery app. I'm giving it 5 star because it is better to use Google's software than using any other.
