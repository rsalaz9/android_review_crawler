My bus got cancelled 2 times and I am not getting any refund as the they refuse to believe the bus was cancelled. This is not a proper system. My bus from Jaipur was cancelled one day before the lockdown because no transport was allowed to go out. I had already paid for it and now the authority says that the bus wasn't cancelled and I should contact the bus operator. And the bus operator says Red bus is responsible. I would never recommend it. The worst app ever!
4,ANUJ SINGHVI,"April 17, 2020",1, Recharge option not coming . Application getting worst day by day . Helpline no. does not respond properly.
5,subramanian perumal,"April 15, 2020",5, Super cool app to book bus tickets. Good offers too. Mobile recharge option through cash back is good idea.

7,Shawn Paes,"April 4, 2020",5, Thanks but one thing you can improve on is to be able to modify pickup points after getting the ticket. Red bus customer sevice could not do it but bus operator did it easily.
8,amarnath pandey,"April 10, 2020",1, Recharge option is not showing now. Earlier it was available. My wallet balance is near to expire and journey is not possible due to lock down.

They have zero coordination with the on ground party and then you have to wait in queues in order to get connected with agents, and then comes the issue resolution part which takes days, even when the travel agent agrees to refund on spot. In the nutshell I would say, stay away from redBus"

We nver get solution for the same. Very poor. No To RED BUS"
30,Rupinder,"March 6, 2020",2," The biggest turn-off for me is misleading text and content. Redbus has cashback offers but this cashback can't be used at once. You don't get to see this t&c upfront, but find out later while using the cashback. Secondly, redbus doesn't have UPI for payments."

First the boarding point contact number they provide they don't bother to receive call of passengers. 2nd they don't come in their given time. In my situation, my bus timing is 12:45pm and bus didn't showed up by 1:45pm. At Iast I have to take another bus to reach my destination. 3rd if passengers want to know the bus number they don't say the bus number which is coming to board the passenger. Don't book bus using redbus, you have to cry later. Thank you"

Even if we book any ticket from the app whenever there is a issue they always ask us to contact the Bus operator. If you call the customer care they are very arrogant. They say we are sorry we cannot do anything. We need to pay extra charges to bus operator when we sit in the bus. They do not take any responsibility. It's always better you book a ticket directly.

This is the second time in a row in this month I faced this issue with redbus. Not sure how can you have technical issues after deducting money. Once is fine twice is not. People travelling on an emergency would totally be troubled. I'm a frequent user of this app but disliking it from now. Totally dissatisfied customer experience. Wish I could rate 0.

After so much effort when i reached they say 72 hrs is the resolution time. What does red bus expect a passenger to do when they reach the but boarding point late night to find out the bus service got discontinued a month back???? Try to call them forever??

Worst experience. Further they don't even show bus number in the message. Then what's the matter of providing phone number if they can't even call and ask the person who has paid for the seat? Just a message was there that your bus will be departing at particular time. No bus number, no platform number provided. I am very unhappy about the service & had to pay again!"

3109,Nilesh Prajapati,"October 29, 2019",1, Very bad experience They deducted the money and ticket not confirmed due to technical issues.they transfer the money into their wallet instead of account . Now they statment is they can't transfer from wallet to account and i have to use that money for buy ticket from red bus.
3110,Sharan Gill,"November 2, 2019",1," The app promises live bus tracking but the bus operators never update their bus tracking details on redbus. I have complained many times but nothing happened. The customer service is very pathetic, they will try to dodge your questions rather then providing the solutions."
3111,Ravi Pinjani,"November 11, 2019",1, Such a waste app with too many annoying app notifications... if you complete first step of rpool by mistake then it keeps on bugging to complete the remaining steps.. that too it asks for official email id which might be prohibited by the company policy to share anywhere.. total waste it is!
