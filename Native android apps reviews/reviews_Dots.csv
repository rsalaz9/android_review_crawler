I understand the concept and perhaps adding that option would make the game too much like others or the scoring too easy or just defeat the purpose of matching them up as you go, I just found it weird to do, but perhaps that's the point. I thought the graphics were good, but maybe some better instructions/demo mode?"

This was topping battery usage after removing from my charger and it wasn't even opened today. I've also seen a subjectively lower battery life since installing before I actually checked the stats. 2nd reason for removing is you won't get far into the second area before you will definitely have to buy power-ups or pray you get lucky. Progression stops and 5 life timer is rediculous.

3,Brandon M,"January 7, 2020",3," I enjoy this game and play it often but recently, for the past few months or so, the game just barely gives me anything to work with.

The majority of the time I'm just getting two dot matches. A lot of the time I get a couple pairs before it needs to reshuffle and then it's just the same problem. It's just a scramble of dots with very few matches. Used to be I could connect long chains of dots and make multiple squares in a round. It feels like something changed and it's very frustrating."
4,Anna Thorsteinsson,"January 24, 2020",2," I get that you made the game harder to sell more power ups, but it's practically unplayable.

I gave up and will play worse looking and worse playing games (that I spend money on) because at least they throw you a bone once in a while. Business department get your s together (good job designers and devs tho)"
5,susan brown,"April 18, 2020",5, My 5 year old great granddaughter showed me this game and now I'm hooked. Fun for any age...REALLY! :-)
6,Courtney Langman,"March 28, 2020",5, Love this game ! I had it on my super old phone and so excited that I found it again and I downloaded on my new phone!
7,Raelene Coburn,"March 3, 2019",1," The game itself is extremely fun, but I have experienced two major problems.  1) There is no way to block or report someone who sends multiple rematch games or has a racist, sexist, anti-semetic, or otherwise offensive screen name.

Game developers do not reply to emails or make upgrades to deal with these problems.  2) If you buy upgrades or have rematches on one phone, EVERYTHING GETS LOST when you get a new phone.  It's really hard to justify spending points and dollars to get everything back when the owners do not care about the user experience."
8,patrick legasse,"June 15, 2019",2," It's a good game, it really is! Not to many adds.

9,Katrina Gigliotti,"August 21, 2019",3," When I just want to play something simple and relaxing, I play this game. I've never gotten into it enough to buy things or play matches, because it doesn't hold my attention for long enough to justify money spent or commitments made. But it's great when I just need a soft distraction."
10,Paula Richard,"June 19, 2019",1," The game itself is entertaining, but the advertisements are every 10-20 moves (ish) and it started eating up my data because of the damn ads. I believe Devs should certainly make an income off of apps, but not at the expense of game quality. On to the next one..."
11,John Burke,"November 2, 2019",5, It is So relaxing and helps you calm down if you are stressed. Definitely 5 star from me! Hope this was helpful.
12,A Google user,"November 18, 2018",5," This app has been my go to game since day one. It's crazy relaxing & helps with my anxiety dramatically üñ§ & I love that there has never been any pop-up ads or anything like that. This game was a lifesaver, so thank you üòÅ"
13,Mandy Berry,"November 11, 2019",4, It's a really fun game. The only problem is that it's TOO fun. It's addicting. I'm a college student; I can't have an addiction and expect to graduate lol
14,Jamie F,"July 28, 2019",2," I like this game, but after spending a lot of time trying to get the achievements, I noticed the dot bonus doesnt show up. I spent a good amount of time doing the barrel roll one for 8,000 dots, and I got nothing. üëéüëéüëé"
15,Alicia Noriega Velasco,"July 28, 2019",5, I've been playing this game for years and I still reach for it when I'm bored in transit or listening to a podcast while unwinding. My go-to mind quieting tool for the last 7+ years. I love this silly game!
16,Michael Roberts,"March 11, 2020",1, $3 dollar customization is extremely limited. Doesn't even have a black background

I still see you haven't replied. My test is over and you failed it
18,Masterbeef,"March 1, 2020",5, Honest to goodness I fell asleep while playing the game. I downloaded the space theme and fell asleep to the sounds!
19,Cl√©ment Micaelli,"July 22, 2019",2," The game has slowly turned into a pay to win, there's no really any strategy behind the game and most of it is basically luck. Fun game nonetheless"
20,A Google user,"October 10, 2018",5," Great casual game, just a few bugs; after buying endless mode, the achievements you earn, do not give you the ""extra"" dots. And you cannot reset the endless mode..."

23,Viscera Trocar,"December 31, 2018",1, Unlimited mode costs money. I understand charging for cosmetic changes but the ONLY part of the game they charge for is the only part I'm interested in. Uninstalled.
24,SpooksColorsZ,"June 23, 2019",4, The game is very addicting and is insanely fun but I don't like how the infinite mode is locked by a pay wall but besides that it's great!
25,Cody Lanier,"March 1, 2020",3, What is up with the god awful sounds this game puts out? Find something soothing. Please.
26,Ricky Partlow,"March 6, 2020",5," Love it! Not that hard, good for clearing your head."

35,Suzi Helenberg,"December 27, 2018",1, Not good for Essential tremors. My hands shake to viilently for this game. It is way to expensive. Would like to get money back but no indication of how to do so?
36,Steffen Breitbach,"August 23, 2019",1, I can't even do the square. The lower right dot doesn't connect.
37,June Love,"November 12, 2018",4, I wish there was a way to keep your progress stats (trophies etc) when reinstalling the app.

Why would you offer dots equal to a doubler in value at a loss instead of just enabling the doubler for those who purchased it. It seems like bad business practice and extremely redundant. I've played this game for years but now this long-time fan is shutting this developer out. It's sad companies care more about the buck than the buyer.
49,Amit Mehta,"March 19, 2019",4, i don't like when games ask for monies. other wise its a great game. not addictive but fantastic stress reliever
50,Valerie Stone,"October 14, 2018",2, It used to be a great game. Now it doesn't give me the points I've won. Thinking about uninstalling.

121,MrSurprise 22,"March 31, 2018",3, There should be a limit for someone to finish a game then you get the win. People who don't play waste my dots which is annoying.

here. Someone called Player r, and now I think changed to just standard 
Player keeps sending loads of challenges, and very often it's the same 
combination. This is annoying as you can't skip them. And you want just a 
bit of fun, not going through the same thing over and over again. This 
someone must be in the game production team as no one else can do that. So, 
please stop that. This is really very annoying."
123,TGL System,"June 7, 2018",3," A great, if slightly monotonous, game. Great customer support too - I 
contacted support about an issue with restoring purchases and they solved 
my problem extremely fast and with little fuss. I highly recommend buying 
the infinite mode too."
124,Isa Torres,"April 21, 2018",1," I have asked for support after an error keeps displaying on my 'challenges'

week that's when it gets boring"
130,Joshua Benn,"May 24, 2019",1, Would be 5 stars but the update removed ability to see your top 10 scores. So unless you have a new high score it won't show up - doesn't give much room for incremental achievement.

223,Corry R,"January 20, 2019",4, The left edge of the 2013 nexus 7 had a very narrow band of touch sensitivity. This results in lost boxes when the chain is broken by losing contact with the screen. The ability to calibrate the screen would be fantastic.

So I can't play the endless game even though it knows that I bought it and every time I try to contact support I get the message that the server can't be reached. Its really starting to irritate me! Fix this for more stars!

324,poshino1222,"October 13, 2015",5,Best. Game. Ever. I absolutely love Dots. Super casual yet super competitive. There are micro transactions but you can unlock them by playing the game. The gameplay is addicting and simple and I haven't ha a problem with the app since it first came out. Keep up the good work!
325,David Cobb,"November 5, 2016",3,"Fun, but no replay value. It's fun, but it gets old quickly. Could be interesting as a minigame in a larger game, though. To be fair, I'm reviewing it by the standards of handheld console games; if you're the sort who can play just Tetris and Bejeweled for months on end without getting bored, you might like this one more."

For some reason, this game was taken off of the App store when Dots & Co was added to the App store. Playdots, Inc. please add this back to the App store. I am angry. I downloaded it on my iPad RIGHT before it was taken off.  Fix this. Great game! (BTW I think you should be able to buy designer and endless mode with dots. I bought both of those already though. Just a suggestion...)"
991,Jake Hendel,"July 16, 2015",2,"Force Closing Love the new look and features and everything, but ever since the update the app takes forever to open and then force closes on its own at random times.

993,Madison Boswell,"July 20, 2015",2,"Dots home screen Whenever I open the app, it just says ""DOTS"" on a blank, black screen and it won't go to the game. Also, before I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 to the Galaxy S6 Edge, it wouldn't let me scroll through the high scores or trophies."
994,K Kilgannon,"July 8, 2015",3,"Not pleased with update The new interface feels sluggish and the actual game feels clunky. The dots are larger and grid feels smaller because of it. The score screen feels like a downgrade from the stylish previous version. Everything just overall looks bigger and more ""in your face""."
995,Olivia Marta,"January 4, 2016",3,Loved until it deleted all my info This was the best easy distraction game ever.

It was fun to try and beat myself and see my progress. Not to mention it rest my dot bank. You can't pick dot color and background color independently anymore. The biggest problem, and I don't know if it's a me problem, but I swear the animation is more exaggerated. I'm epileptic and it immediately sets me off. Headache, dizziness and nausea for hours after only playing for a minute. So it's goodbye for me."
997,Daniel Douglas,"August 2, 2015",3,Good little puzzle just a few bugs Won't let me buy new themes using dots as keeps crashing. Also crashers randomly in game. Please sort this as I love the app and find it a good way to pass the time.
998,A Lot Later,"July 9, 2015",4,Bug plus suggestion I accidentally use the +5moves when I have to slide up from the bottom. Was better when buttons were all visible. Huge suggestion: use gyro to alter gravity effect when collapsing dots ;-) this would help making squares and hit much higher scores!!!
999,Brandi S,"October 12, 2015",1,Freezes upon opening I don't know what you did but now it when I attempt to open the app a new dots logo shows up on a black screen and gets stuck there. I can't get the home button on my phone to appear and I can't pull down the top drop menu. I have to press power and slide open one of the quick apps to exit the app.
1000,Yogi,"October 14, 2015",3,Good! But bugs after the last update After the last update the game freezes every now and then for a few seconds. And also bring back the onscreen buttons(which were there before the update but now they are gone) so that i can go to the menu WITHOUT ACCIDENTALLY ADDING FIVE MORE MOVES.
1001,NeuralNetProcessor,"September 25, 2015",4,"No subject. Dude this game is so addictive. My mom and I are battling it out right now lol. Edit: The game needs an Undo button. I will start to do a line and see a square, and in removing my finger from the screen I inadvertently take two dots with me that I didn't want. That would be a great update!"
1002,Screw You,"July 10, 2015",1,New Update Is Terrible They completely changed the scores section and it sucks now. It's pointless to play the game for me now because a glitch allowed me to get a ridiculous score of 1700. Unfortunately the game is now ruined.
1003,Novicia Dewi,"November 5, 2015",5,"Addicted to this game! After got some medals then take a look at the list..I want to have all of it! Sometimes, when I play the time challenge, the blank page or an error occurs suddenly for about 10-15 seconds.."

1006,John G,"July 9, 2015",1,"New version sucks Yep...the newest version of dots is a huge disappointment. Stripped away the various scoring features which was the main reason I played. Was fun trying break my own high scores to get in the top 10 list. No more.  You basically play to only beat your highest score now. Very, very disappointed."
1007,xXSimply BlondeXx,"November 2, 2015",5,Love this game Great game of dots. This might sound weird or something but this game is really calming. It's a relaxing game.  I can just go to it when I'm not relaxed and all tensed up and just play this game. Good job! Keep up the good work!

1011,Wayne Williams,"July 21, 2016",3," Really nice and simple and fun game but it really needs a backup option or something.  I got to over 10000 dotes and got the space premium theme and then my phone broke, I transferred to the new phone and lost all my dots and the premium theme."
1012,Shelby M,"December 7, 2015",3,"Great game but has issues Good game, fun way to waste time. But Challenge doesn't connect to Facebook anymore so you can only challenge people you don't know.

1014,Kaya Krawiec,"January 1, 2016",4,"Fun, but costly I find this game a good, strategic game. it is pretty fun but the good ppart of it is the desigbner section. You can design your own color of dots and bsckround, but first you must pay about a dollar to make it available. :(  annoying!!!!"
1015,Diana Barham,"January 25, 2016",5,"My mom and I are hooked The title says it all! Love the simplicity and it's just fun. I wish that you could see the ""queue"" for strategy though. I'm tempted to purchase the full app, but I'm afraid that I'll get lost in the game... I want to support apps that I enjoy, so I will... and brave the danger."
1016,Crystal Smoot,"July 16, 2015",1,"Not fun anymore Everything I liked about this game is gone with the new update. It runs slow, the dots are too bulky, and you can't see your scores anymore. Most of the fun was trying to beat your own top score. I'm very disappointed with the game since it updated."
1017,Alastair Norcross,"July 23, 2015",2,Downhill fast Was an enjoyable waste of time until began to get frustrated that my hi scores stopped being recorded correctly. Latest version is super shiny and dreadfully slow.

1019,Miles Madison,"November 1, 2015",1,Took my money without unlocking unlimited I used to love this game. I've had it for a year or two. At one point I purchased unlimited. However since I had to hard reset my phone it won't restore my purchase of unlimited mode. Not cool.
1020,Bryan Andrews,"April 15, 2016",2,"Really fun game if... You want the game to freeze at 43 seconds every other time you play a round of Timed. I have a Nexus 6p, so Id doubt it has to do with me."

1128,Debra Utley,"May 28, 2016",1,"Please fix!!! At first I thought the problem was that my screen was dirty but, I have played other connect the dots games and had no problems connecting dots. This game won't let connect dots of the same color that are right next to each other!!!"
1129,Nancy Elder,"July 12, 2015",4,"Issues I think you should bring the mode where you could play multiplayer on the same device, via taking turns. also, just make the customizer cost, like, maybe about 25-100k dots, instead of making us pay for it."
1130,Kinola Ford,"July 13, 2015",3, I have never had to write a review on a game ever but i just had to.....Please please please bring back the top ten high scores...it's one of the reasons why I enjoyed dots...now I don't like it as much.
1131,nadia fletcher,"November 26, 2015",5,"Love it!! This game is just so much fun! It's coulours and themes are so bright and cheerful. I like the way the New updates give you something to work towards that aren't just badges. It's really fun,simple,bright,addictive and just plain GREAT!"
1132,Joseph DeLuise,"April 15, 2016",5,"Fun little time-killer Very addictive and great for when you have a few minutes to kill.  Even though games are quick, being able to pause is a great feature."

1134,Shelby Rich,"November 14, 2015",1,Ripped off Brought the endless mode and don't have unlimited Shrinker's etc. And they took $4.11 cents out of my bank instead of $2.11 very disspointed
1135,Antoine Blanchette-Doucet,"September 16, 2015",2,Keeps crashing Crashes every 2-3 games. It even crashed in the achievements menu. 2 stars because it's free and the devs have other stuff to do I guess.

1140,Annaka Tong-Law,"September 7, 2015",4,Good. More challenges please This is a really good game but two dots is probably nicer because of the challenges and different layouts
1141,Mikau Anaki,"October 1, 2015",5,So simple yet so fun! The simplicity of it combined with the sound design makes me feel so good just playing this! The way the notes change when you get a higher combo of dots makes you feel rewarded for connecting them.
1142,Christine Bruce,"July 9, 2015",3,"Issue with update. I updated the app recently, and when I try to load it, it hangs on the loading screen. This is my fav app, and I'm sad it won't work anymore. :("

I can buy stuff, it doesn't lag and everything is super duper!! This is my previous review before the app was updated ---- I sincerely love the game, it's the best arcade game, however the latest update leaves me handicapped, as I cannot make purchases - just shows the ""loading "" screen. I noticed that other users have reported this. Hope you resolve this issue asap, will rate you five star then, as I previously did for an earlier version."
1685,Steven Quach,"July 3, 2015",4, Works well again. Fun little casual game to pass the time. Would have liked it to show a list of your best scores rather than just one like the older versions but not a deal breaker for me :)

1905,A J,"March 22, 2015",5,"Fun game, great UI Love the simplicity of both the game and the UI. The best version I've seen with all these copycat dot games. Clean and easy to control, and love that there are no ads."
1906,A Google user,"June 26, 2015",5,"Fun game, no ads Loving this game!  There's no obtrusive ads, no strong push to use real money to buy things to succeed in the game.  (That's why I left Candy Crush).  The reward factor with the chiming sounds is high."
