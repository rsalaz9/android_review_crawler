Enough already with all of the ads before starting any kind of game, or when you leave a game...here we go again with the slew of ads. Also, with all of the in game bonuses, or ""special cards"" to help you win more chips, that in itself has caused my phone to crash due to all of the animations that come with the bonuses. Because it freezes everything, I reboot the app, thus missing out on hands way too much. Stop, just stop! Used to speak highly of this app...no longer do."

There is a high lack of explaination of the games. There is lots of collusion between players and extremely high rakes on many of the games. No details are offered on how jackpots and prizes are distributed, so you are often left in the dark, without being allowed to understand the odds. Well built app from HELL."

Beware of problems with gameplay. 1. Problems with signal fading during play. 2.

I've never bought any and won't but they sure have many pop ups trying to get you to purchase them."

13,Noam Gordon,"April 21, 2020",1, The amount of times a round is won on the river doesn't make any sense. It has to be rigged. And most of the time the winner has junk cards.

I never bought chips and never will. I'd just lose them on the river to some guy (or bot - it's hard to tell) who had a 2-7 and went all in pre-flop.

Still a great poker playing game though."

You can't use their poker name or email. It's also ruined by bully players. The ones whose tactic is to just steal blinds. Especially in the tournament - to reach finals, only to lose because your opponent forces you to go all in or fold, before the flop, because they have more money. It is the cowards way to win, and ruins the game. This should be controlled, like maybe a limit on how many times in a row someone can go all in."

If you've got a hand that would under normal circumstances be sure to win the RNG will favor the paying player or bot during the last two card reveals. Manipulates you into believing you had a chance when you fold. When you do win you get a very small win compared to what bots win. Play the game on two different accounts on different devices but only pay for chips on one and see which one wins more.

They constantly release side game modes that encourage terrible play such as the current fold or all in on the flop and beat the dealer which should reward like 3 card poker but if the dealer couldn't play it was a push on both bets as opposed to a 1:1 win on ante. The weaker hand typically wins all in bets preflop. An absurd amount of ads. And setup hands are a plenty such as 3 people hit a flush on flop and ofc the biggest stack won.🗑
33,A I Neiss,"April 25, 2020",1," Seems like a decent game at first, but after some time, you realize that unless you purchase chips, your game experience becomes overwhelming loss and waiting for the next hand since you have to fold almost every hand. Its really a complete waste of time."

I get a winnable hand maybe 1 out of 30 hands & they will even get beat sumtimes. But I'll watch 1 player get great hands 5-6 times in a row.

Plays like live tournament poker. There's significantly more bad beats & betting of weird hands when blinds increase so rapid. Everyone must play short-stack strategy. Betting to see if players made their flush & testing if players are scared of losing their chip lead is authentic. Increase in blinds is too fast to practice for live tables. Little slower would help tremendously. Offer diff speed or timed tournaments. Cash tables no substitute for tournament practice. Thx

It is getting boring playing and always losing.

Too many players seem to be computer players and not real people and that hurts the game.

I wish once you long in for the day or just while still playing the game it only shows once. I also wish you could log on with Google account/ Gmail. Still the best poker game out there. I wish I could find a dominoes game made like this poker game.

I wish that it was a truly random game but the game designers purposely alter the outcome under various circumstances. This means that, with careful analysis, you can figure out how to alter your play to gain an unfair advantage. To me this is not true poker but it is still fun."
163,Ben Hudson,"April 26, 2020",5," Best poker app around. Most people actually play like real, for status pts & goals! Bracelets, rings, & trophies will keep you grinding like a poker pro. Very fun, but fair warning, highly addictive!"

Its like a used car lot meets home shopping network meets pop-up ads meets scratch off tickets meets video slots in a gas station run by ex bookie carnies on meth. Stop it. The tackiness devalues your product and looks desperate.

Would be nice to be able to get more chips quicker.
272,Bob Childers,"February 13, 2020",1, Very frustrating game! It plays fine at first then slows down so you can't play. Why does it act like the game doesn't want you to win when you have a hand that is good? It slows the play down or says connection lost. I have come close to deleting it because it plays so poorly.
273,Gerald Tabanao,"February 23, 2020",2," Way too many ads! Great game but the amount of selling ads sucks. Update: Well, that was some lousy excuse regarding the""informative"" pop-ups. For this, it's another star off. I'm sure you can reduce it to just one pop-up."

Also some how some way I got delt the same 2 cards 4 rounds in a row. Kinda hard to get any wins with a 2/3 deal and 10-A flops cant even bluff cuz someone always has a flush or full house to your pair or high card Random dealing for you but the ones play against never seem to get as random cards as yours but good try though fool someone else still wont pay

397,Suresh Chandra,"February 18, 2020",1, It's only good for free play. Dont fall into the trap of buying any chips. The game seems to be rigged where there is a good chance of busting the chips in few plays so that you can buy more chips.

401,Breathing liquid,"February 7, 2020",1, The game is rigged. Set up to make you want to buy chips. Joke. 80 percent of the time your playing bots. If you want to play a unrealistic game of poker and get pissed off this it's it. More like crappie bingo.

480,Gary Marquardt,"April 9, 2020",3," Too many nagging ads for chips. one upon entry or when felted is plenty. other than that, an option to disclose after showdown would add realism."
481,Jessica Broussard,"February 19, 2020",1, It's fun to play when you can get it to load. That last update screwed it up. The generic response given just lets me know exactly how much you value my opinion. Now you only get one star. It's not my connection lol.
482,Eric Rauch,"February 13, 2020",1," This app is rigged. Never seen so many hands lose on the river. I'm sure the more you spend, the better the cards. Playtika controls the percentages. River wins 80% of the time. Worse than Vegas"
483,no one,"March 18, 2020",1," The ladies as load apparently don't face gamer, changed game allot some allright others terrible , very basic terms games available, very realistic casino bombardment lights sounds , could use improvement, use awesome when really ""cool"" Hollywood culture ruins allot using awesome for better people"
484,Steve Obeda,"March 25, 2020",3," Social poker isn't the same as real money poker, and most players are not skilled. But it's still poker. Constant pop ups for deals to buy chips are annoying but I guess they have to make money somehow."
485,Max Chrisman,"February 23, 2020",1, Very unrealistic hands. River card always beats the winning hand. I was dealt with pocket sevens three times in a row. Game is designed only to get you to buy more chips. Don't waste your time on this horrible site.
486,Robert Silva,"April 9, 2020",1," If you like completely unrealistic game play that doesn't exist in the real world, this is the game for you. Three hands of quads inside of five minutes of gameplay. Clearly rigged to sell fake chips, shame on you WSOP."
487,Anthony Duncan,"March 18, 2020",1, I've been playing actively for a few months. I recently won the valentine's and St Patrick bracelets. Both said the winnings would be split amongst bracelet winners. I've never seen any currency my way from winning bracelets. It's really disappointing because I've paid real money to support them
488,suresh kumar,"April 2, 2020",1," Even after turning off auto buy, keep buying automatically. Fonts are too small to read. Annoying jackpot message keep popping up and blocking others hand"
489,Carmen Freeman,"April 17, 2020",5, It gets better as you go. I give this game one hundred percent because it kept me from boredom

It seems like their system sucks the bankroll out of the ones that ACTUALLY spend money on the app. System needs to be fixed. I could not buy a penny and win millions, but the numerous times I spend money then I get major hands and get sucked out by hands that shouldn't even be in and they develope straights, or boats, etc etc. Bad development for those that actually spend money for the developers."
493,Justin Auvil,"February 29, 2020",4, The game itself is awesome. The UI is intuitive and it's easy to hop in and get started if you already know the games. Four stars is for how intrusive the advertising feels.
494,Brylee Hawk,"March 4, 2020",2," Im always getting kicked from the app while I'm in the middle of playing. Sometimes it will happen in my first hand, other times it could be while I'm playing my twentieth hand"
495,Mike Corkran,"February 19, 2020",5, It's WSOP how can you go wrong? Yes when playing for virtual money you get the players that would never play the way they do in the game but there are also a lot of legit strategy players to challenge your real game skills.
496,Eugene Pennetti,"March 21, 2020",5," The format and graphics are excellent. I think the website would get more players if chips could be freely acquired through viewing short sponsor advertisements. Which is what competitive poker website do! UPDATE, AND GET WITH THE PROGRAM."
497,Corey Ham,"February 25, 2020",1," Game play is awesome. However, to many glitches on winning hands. I've lost tens of millions in chips on a glitch when I had the winning hand"

499,J,"March 29, 2020",3," Friends team up, hard to win with 2 or 3 players playing together.. When u win big, you'll get bad cards, till game gets it back, pretty obvious."
500,Derek Habig,"April 26, 2020",4, It's a good poker game gives me lots of free coins where in can usually play with out buying chips
501,A Google user,"March 16, 2020",2," Not very realistic, lots of flushes, fullboats, and quads. You will lose all your chips and if you still want to play you have to buy chips."
502,A Google user,"February 24, 2020",5," When playing the game that gives us 30 seconds to pick the best hand, the 30 seconds Sometimes evaporates so we have no time. I don't always get the full 30 seconds"
503,Jose J. Miranda,"April 16, 2020",5, It overheats my battery on any device I use.......still keeps overheating my device........thank you much better
504,Aj Tv,"February 25, 2020",2," Good game, easy to get chip. played almost a month and happy. But need to Uninstall it after 1 week playing and not winning any chip. Literally anything. maybe out of luck. Good game.."
505,John Morse,"March 2, 2020",1, it is it is obvious when I fold a hand the very cards eyeful come up to a full House and everytime I have a winning hand and make a large someone wins on the river with a flush but I've been playing a long time so it don't really matter I just do it the past time
506,Scott M.,"February 12, 2020",1, This app is just full of ad garbage. I get like 10 ads before I can even play the damn game. Buyin are too high and the chips go very fast. There are better options out there
507,Den Den,"February 12, 2020",3, Its good overall. The auto buy in and top off can take all your chips when it should kick but support is very helpful. Just not responsive. Still get the supoort tickets taken care of tho haha
508,Lorena Oliver,"April 19, 2020",5, This game is fun and very entertaining. I live poker and find it to be a really good game.
509,Jeremy Adams,"April 13, 2020",1, Never in my life have a seen a game with so many pop ups. Nobody cares about your crappy deals. This game had 6 pop ups when you log in. Its crazy.
510,Vincent Perry,"March 13, 2020",5," This game is action pack I really enjoyed you can raise bet, play with friends, make friends and give money to help other player. I'm very impressed at all the things that this game allows you to do it's real poker"

Payouts are way 2 low. What a sad state online poker is in. Not a real game anywhere. Being crooked is the new norm. Everybody has the same chance of winning & Acceptable standards are the 2 lines every online poker site quotes religiously. Think about those statements. Acceptable standards by who? All the crooks? Everybody has equal chance of winning? No wonder suckouts are so predictable online.
513,eric schmidt,"April 13, 2020",1, Never even played it. Kept crashing when trying to sign in. Deleting now.
514,Supercheedercheese Gamer,"April 14, 2020",1, This game has many problems e.g if you lose connection tou lose all the money you brought into the game not just your bets and sometimes more as someone with bad internet this is a problem.
515,Stephen Kroman.,"April 15, 2020",3," Good game fun, teaches you how to manage your money"
516,Joann Tippet,"April 4, 2020",5," Enjoying the game so much, it needs for credits for daily bonus. Best poker game ever,I'm back after a year and nothing has changed still the same game"

518,Daryll Flaro,"February 17, 2020",4," Great game, has issues where I cant see most of my facebook friends. Tried everything and can't get it to work. This needs to be fixed"
519,Robert Martin,"February 19, 2020",2, It isn't the least bit realistic. You have many hands with multiple full houses. Unless you keep buying chips you can't win. The more you buy the more you lose. So don't waste your money.
520,Barry Guy,"February 17, 2020",1, Same old same old doesn't matter who has better cards what matters is who the app wants to win only been playing a short time and have lost 4 hands to inside straight being hit on the river so if you want to play bingo this is your app
521,Scott Tompsett II,"February 16, 2020",1, Too many pop ups when you open the game to the menu or even get off a table and go to the lobby and there are four or five popups every time!!
522,maximus prime,"March 4, 2020",3, cool app. just kind of wondering sometimes if the randomization of cards is sometimes fixed such that you'll lose eventually. Winning at first but lose all you coins at some point.
523,Steve Milligan,"March 17, 2020",5, Great way to pass the time. will not force you spend money. play the level you are happy to play at. Don't get sucked into have millions of chips and it will stay free to play. Ignore most of the pop ups.
524,Tommy Degrange,"March 1, 2020",4, Love the game however I would like to see a few changes. Like the ability to select a lower buy in to Caribbean or king of the table based on your availabil money not club rank.
525,Wayne Hathaway,"March 18, 2020",3," Keep having problems freezing up in the middle of hands. Just in the last 2 weeks it's cause me 4 mill, and so far with watching adds for extra money there all freezing up every time."

Then, When I went back to play, I lost every good hand, every bad hand, every hand. 8 tournaments in a row. This is unlike my real life experience as well as my experience pre reviewing. People say this game is rigged to make you mad so you will pay to buy chips. I now believe them. However, I will just quit for a while as I rack up my free daily chips."
527,David Martin,"April 16, 2020",5, Very good game but I notice sometimes when I'm about to win a hand it freezes and then I end up losing thats hand it needs to be fixed in that aspect .
528,Toby Goodman,"April 14, 2020",4, Awesome game. Much more than a time killer. Keep up the good work
529,Robert Richeson,"February 16, 2020",3, slow loading - slow players - too many ads - flushes dealt nearly every other hand - not getting credit for many of the videos watches - one video was 10 minutes long with no credit when it was over.
530,Julius Devai,"February 5, 2020",2, U manipulate the draws. Simply not possible to 20 draws without a winning one hand! At the same time an other player had constantly straights or flushes. I newer ever will pay for chip. At Zynga P I am a L17 player with 1.7 B chips.
531,Buddy Owens,"February 13, 2020",2," Flashy but not serious. Every time you play you have to close 3 windows to not pay real money. Tons of gimmicks. Wanna play just free poker? Use PokerStars Play app, not this."
532,Jake Hawkins,"March 10, 2020",3," The app itself is great i love poker. But man downloading/load screen both on my phone and computer, is by far the worst/slowest (if it even works) thing i have ever had to endure on gods green earth."
533,Nancy Anderson,"February 13, 2020",4," Ok game would be funner if other casino games were available to play in a different scenarios. But not necessarily as a WSOP packet , however faster play per player at the table would be great."
534,Dillon Parks,"February 6, 2020",1, Too many ads. RNG is garbage. There are way better poker games on the app store. Worst one I've played yet. Consistently laggy causing multiple issues in game.
535,Tim Crissinger,"February 16, 2020",4, Most games seem very realistic except the hands that are dealt in all in/fold games. There are always many more unexpectedly high hands that make it much more difficult toplay actual real poker.
536,Mark Sandstrom,"February 22, 2020",3," Can't focus and enjoy the game, ads pop at inopportune times, selection criteria changes and moves around, and I'm not a fan of the pushy timeline."
537,Scott Carl Scott,"April 12, 2020",4," This app is a good way to practice your hold em chops, but it is somewhat rigged to favor the high better. Big hands happen way more frequently than a good old fashioned analog game."
538,Jerome Vincent San Nicolas,"April 21, 2020",5, Great for lock down gaming....and you still enjoy gambling...and keeps social distancing a plus....great game...
539,TheBABYDOLL786,"April 25, 2020",2, Was a very good game and experience but now it's all about buying chips
540,Oŕson Cart,"April 5, 2020",1, Slow to load. No tournaments. Silly games to make you lose your stack quickly hoping your purchase more chips. To many ads.

544,A Google user,"March 13, 2020",5," been playing this game for a number of years, great app. Lately you've was me to update your data collection of my info, why is that? Don't you have enough, I won't play until this is resolved"
545,Taylor Doyle,"February 14, 2020",1, Games decent literally watched my money get cut into a 4th of what it was when logging in after not being a lobby and not playing. No point in spending on a game that cant keep the data stored properly
546,Kevin Mankowski,"March 4, 2020",1," Still having problems believing this is not rigged, when people never lose a hand in the whole game and go all in every hand. And they dont reply back thinking you throw in computer players to drop your level rating."

549,Henry Reynero,"March 22, 2020",3, This game is very entertaining but more time than not it's cheats you on the card. I can have a flush and lose to a three of a kind. It's annoying
550,Scott Renfroe,"March 22, 2020",4," Good game, chat options could be better and to many pop ups when you first log in...they seem endless when you just want to jump on and play a few games."
551,Ian Paterson,"March 25, 2020",3, Great games. Too much interference from sales ads piggy bank in particular. Too much chat allowed at table. Very unprofessional. I'm frustrated by it all so am leaving the game.
552,Chris,"March 30, 2020",1, Pretty sure this game is coded to make you lose chips so you will buy them. Several occasions where it baited me into betting my chips against computers and then they hit running cards to beat my hand.
553,Eugene Mckinney,"April 8, 2020",3, I can't keep a connection to the site. I keep having to log into the site for some reason. It doesn't matter what I do to log in I keep getting booted off.

559,Chris Redenius,"February 17, 2020",3," Fun game but it's the house who ALWAYS has the advantage. Buyer beware! Then they suck you into ridiculous purchases at their extremely overpriced ""sale/bonus buys""."

561,Dave P,"February 6, 2020",1, Annoying. Keeps disconnecting mid-game and losing the coins i've already bet. Used to be good but a waste of time now with all the bloatware/ads that have been added in updates

564,Paul Evans,"March 16, 2020",1, Absolute rubbish nothing to do with the way cards are dealt. ( how rude ro assume that) The game keeps quiting and then reloadx2 only for it quit again. Then to time you out and lose a million. Wasting my time. Paul.
565,Woody Woodz,"March 21, 2020",5, I really love playing this game as it sometimes feels like I'm playing for real-(I Wish)but it's only a bit of fun as I play with my mates to see who can make the most money etc so I reckon you should download this app n start playing.
566,Zussy Coello,"March 18, 2020",2, Comp will let you win and be on a streak when it wants to. And let's you lose all your money as well to purchase. So just good to pass some time here and there but no way like playing in real life.
567,John Maccormick,"April 4, 2020",3, it's fun.....but i agree it's set up for bad beats.....don't use real money unless you don't care to loose it.i will never use real money.

573,Faith Woodhouse,"February 16, 2020",1, There are way too many pop-ups. It's incredibly annoying. Also there's a lot of things that don't work. I've sent things to be troubleshooted that weren't resolved for a long time.
574,Joe Hanes,"February 26, 2020",3, Constantly dropping the game during the tournaments I've only finished a few tournaments because they're so long and the app usually quit during the middle of it taking all the money not a whole lot of fun
575,Paul Washington,"March 10, 2020",3, Not a bad app but it needs to be updated to 4G and the graphicsas well. I will lose the signal in the middle of playing hands.

596,Arron McFarland,"April 17, 2020",1," This game is an absolute piece of GARBAGE. Do not expect to play real players, just a bunch of idiots who do not know what they are doing. They let every single idiot play so good luck. I would pick another app to play do not waste your time."
597,Joey Jordison,"April 17, 2020",1," You'll never win if you face with higher rank. The card is not ""random""."
598,A Google user,"March 20, 2020",2, When I purchase extra chips I find that I loose them quickly because I seem to get bad cards or spins which causes my chip value to drop rapidly. I'm going start looking at other poker games.
599,Edward Peete,"February 21, 2020",2, Way too many buy chips . You have to close alot of these before you can even log in . I will never purchase chips . I would rather play the adds to get chipps than buy .
600,Joseph Thomas,"April 5, 2020",1, The game is fixed you will have so many good hands but you will be beat all the time they try to take your Chips they're very expensive to try to buy chips I've never bought chips and never will the game is fixed

603,Jerry Waller,"March 26, 2020",4, the game is fun...but my thing is that it seems like usally one seat gets the winning hands...doesnt matter if they call 7 2 offsuit or aa...the one seat always seems to win
604,Daniel Kelley,"February 11, 2020",4, good way to learn the game. the ads pop up when you try to see the outcome of a hand. not sure how honest. the new commercials suck!
605,Don Kirby,"February 9, 2020",3," Good fun, but way too many splash screens in front of the action. Too many pop ups too."
606,bigg slo,"March 7, 2020",2, Too much flash and ads. It's hard to see what's going on. Needs to be simplified. Takes away from the actual poker.
607,Leo Fowler,"April 1, 2020",2, It is a mediocre game at best they care more about how much chips you buy in money you spend then the actual programming of the game. Do not wish your time on this game.

612,Bill Bundy,"April 7, 2020",1, Its rigged to get you to buy chips you cant tell me that 2 or 3 players have the same hand and i lose the hand because one player has more chip the player with the most chip will win the hand 80% of the time
613,JoeB1 Kenobie,"April 3, 2020",3," Keep getting booted out of the game in the middle of tournaments or hands lost about 5 million fake dollars, hope it gets fixed soon"

644,John Horner,"February 17, 2020",2," Do not expect superior cards to win over the young and low chip 2 - 9 player. If you do not ""buy"" you will lose by WSOP ""algorithms"""
645,Steve Richards,"February 6, 2020",4," Good game, Could be better if you could select how many players per table, I like 5 player game but can only go on 9 player tables."
646,Brian Uhrich,"February 19, 2020",1, Worst game EVER. A distribution certificate doesn't prove anything. I just lost to 280m to 3 deuces when I hit trip aces on the river. Your site is a joke!!!!
647,Manoj Kumar Jambla,"April 20, 2020",4, Its not working properly. I keep on re installing it but nothing happens. It just stands still at loading screen.
648,Vinnie K,"March 9, 2020",5, It's a great experience for a free app. You get some free chips and also gives opportunities to win more. Nicely set up and makes play a breeze.
649,Annette Linton,"April 1, 2020",5, Fun games and events that don't cost money. There should be more bigger free stuff. Smaller buy ins for bigger pay outs. ;)
650,Ralph Chavez,"March 27, 2020",5, Great app so far.... Interface is easy to understand and graphic are top shelf. Also the game itself gives incentives in chips for every game you play which is very cool.

662,Melody Sims,"March 3, 2020",5," There are a few choices on game type and you can choose between holdem and omaha. I have never had an issue with this game glitching, plus it is nice to get bugged to purchase chips with real money"

694,keith wilson,"February 6, 2020",1," This is so unrealistic. Donkeys calling with nothing, and sucking out. Don't expect to win with the best hand. Have you ever seen quads on the board? Happens a lot. Not normal poker. If you don't buy chips, you'll never win. But why would you want to spend money, when you can't get real money out?"

Thot it would at least guide me through a couple hands before turning me lose. Really lame. No im not experiencing technical difficulties. Why dont you just come out and call me stupid?! The game moves too fast and i've never played poker in my life. So while pro players can quickly decide which hand is better, im running out of time and auto fold b4 i can decide. STILL VERY LAME!"

Anyone who complains about beats doesnt understand poker. My problems- the buttons are not visible and im always losing them. The pop ups for promotions come on and block the game play. It is impossible to select the proper bet amount. There is a button for 1/2 and pot size bet. There is a slider which is worthless xcept for pushing all in. My hand is often folded before i can select bet amount. The tourneys only pay half of prize pool paid in. That made me quit"

The overall level of play is pittiful regardless of level until you reach master, which requires patience, luck, and generous donations of real money to wade through all of the stupidity. Which is another problem - fake money equals bad play because nobody cares about the stakes, and with so many people buying chips by the millions and throwing them around like donkey biscuits, at least 25% of the hands are won by bingo playing morons. Donkeys are supposed to lose, as real players know. Same with whales who try to intimidate people with big bets. Yet their winning percentages are unbelievably high. It's as if BAD poker is the purpose of this site. Also, everyone there seems fascinated with aces, as if one card is better than two. AVOID THIS SITE!! Your skills will only deteriorate."

Outside of that the game is generally fun unless you run into tables where people like to always bid high even pre-flop when they have nothing because you can have over 1 billion and still play at the 1-5 million buy in. Had people bid 3 million+ pre-flop at 25k/50k stake tables when they had a 2 and 9 offsuit multiple times. Frustrating when you have 2-3 mill to work with and have to go all in pre-flop. But not risking actual money so it happens

I would recommend this game to those who enjoy playing poker. This game has something to offer the beginner or the more advanced player. We've met players from around the world. Every day is a different group of players. I love that! If you are a people person who is competitive this game is for you.
1802,Willie Woodrow,"March 15, 2020",4, The ranking makes it tough. Goes to extreme on money. Hard to win a cheap bracelet. Makes you resort to tournament's. Lots of all in players.Lots of rude people. Its supposed to be fun!
1803,ndabuko luvuno,"January 17, 2020",3," The last 6 times I've tried to play I haven't been able to enter the game, the loading screen bar doesn't move and it stays on 'downloading ' it's possible that this is a wifi problem tho because my internet service provider had a underwater cable malfunction Otherwise it's a good game"
1804,Not my real name,"November 13, 2019",2," Too many ads and phone notifications. There's no way to turn them off either, I don't like all of those icons on my screen. Other than that, the actual gameplay is great. Give the option to turn off out-of-app notifications and I will change to 5 stars."
1805,Cynthia Jones,"November 23, 2019",4, It's loads of fun but it glitches out sometimes. I've lost a few big big pots because of it. MORE ROULETTE PLEASE!! I did reach out through the help link in the app but i have not received a response.

1807,Jerry Sy,"December 2, 2019",3," Fun game. Until it becomes rigged. U can tell because even if u play tight, there's still a time when u lose for 3-5hrs straight even when u play top hands. I know badbeat happens but to be badbeat always in 3hrs straight. Obviously it's rigged. I hope u can improve on this."
1808,Allen Moredock,"December 25, 2019",1, Game used to be decent but now they are trying to do too much with it. App is very wonky. FREEZES A LOT. It's not device related like they say. It even happens on two different laptops.

1810,Brad Coleman,"January 11, 2020",4," Fun game to play...sometimes the hands don't make sense, but it's still fun to play...also, the owners shouldn't make the price of the coins or the bonus games too expensive... makes people not want to purchase because it feels unreasonable...just my thoughts..."

1812,Paul Caudill,"January 30, 2020",3," The gameplay is good, but the ads, and stuff that pop up are annoying as hell. I would rather buy the game, and never see them."
1813,Brandon 392,"January 30, 2020",2, Multiple pop ups when you open. Blinds increase fast so towards the end of a game so you can't strategically bet and becomes more like bingo

1821,A Google user,"January 2, 2020",1, No matter what device I use or WiFi connection I'm using ; this Ap bogs down losing connection when I'm winning for a long period. Causing me to fold hands without consent and lose chips . This Ap used to be enjoyable. I look foward to finding a new poker site after many years of playing here.
1822,Lawrence Maegdlin,"February 1, 2020",5, Fun different from other formats. Excellent 5 stars all the way!!! All the bells and whistles!!! Excellent...just won 12 million Funnn!!!!
1823,Bob Burch,"November 13, 2019",4," I enjoy the game but , every time logging in or going to lobby after being at table it is maddening that the game puts up offers to try to get me to spend real money on chips that is the only part I cannot stand."
1824,Albert Porter,"November 20, 2019",5," This game is awesome ,free and plus it keeps records the whole time rather on or off the game. Yeah, it's free and you never have to worry about keeping up with friends. Matter of fact you can invite people on line to enjoy the game and chat while playing."
1825,Sharon Straws,"November 24, 2019",5," I like the action! It makes me think quickly but accurately! Frustrating yet fun! (no picture on review, please.)

1839,Alan Bross,"November 25, 2019",5, So far its been fun and enjoyable! I don't have to create bad beating habits just to be in the game. What I mean I have been on sites where every hand is almost an all in hand. No skills learned with that approach! WSOP still a class act!
1840,Erica Torres,"March 24, 2020",1, Is like this game sets you up to fail if im not buying chips this game deals me the worst hands possible

1857,Dianna Butterfield,"November 12, 2019",3," Play amounts should always be left up to the players. They let pros play any level game and that should be for all. Play Caribbean poker and they make you play the amount the game wants, not the level the player is comfortable with."
1858,Art Durocher,"November 18, 2019",5, I tried 3 other poker apps and ended up playing this one the most. It has a easy to adapt to system. Minor peeve is that they can be too aggressive in wanting you to purchase more chips.

1894,James Phillips,"January 20, 2020",1, Worst unrealistic game of holdem. Too unreal. Too many bots. The APP takes your chips using bots so that you will purchase their chips. I've played live poker for 40 years. This is an unrealistic APP. Waste of precious time.

Your answer is not what is really happening.time after time 2 card same suit hole cards and then 3 card flops different suit but 3 card flush. You know my fave. Play cards are flush hole cards. I see right through your stat collecting fairness.

1903,Silver13 S13,"January 8, 2020",3," A good game to kill some time but overall it freezes abit too often. I have use different wifi connections and my data, so i know it is not me. I have lose too many good hands cause of this freeze."
1904,David Summers,"January 21, 2020",2, This app wants you to spend $$ and asks you to do so WAY too often. You have to go through 6 to 10 tabs that try to sell you chips before you can play your first game. And like EVERY free/non cash poker sites people play like idiots...I have a 3-9 off suit...lets go all in!! Doh!!
1905,Jimmy Roberts,"January 28, 2020",1," Rigged game. Free until they need you to pony up, then your opponents amazingly win on the river every time."
1906,Melissa Johnson,"February 3, 2020",5, Liked the game but recently I stop seeing the slot machine and daily task ask to earn some chip on the slot. How can I do my daily task if I don't have the slot machine.
1907,Reald Rbk,"April 5, 2020",1, More advertising than you can play
1908,Botan Botani,"March 2, 2020",1, This game is fixed to keep you buy chips it sucks
1909,Terry Strouse,"April 15, 2020",4, Only want to play if it doesn't cost anything.

I like poker alot and this game is the farthest thing from that you could imagine they just want to get as much money from you as they possibly can in the begining it was fun but start actually playing and the hands will set you up to fail and lose chips everytime i spent 10$ thinking hey 160mil ill be good forever NOPE the slots are rigged if you bet high the winning rate goes way down bet low yeah you can win what you spent
1911,Anthony Johndon,"December 14, 2019",4," Completely legit poker, for all the people who think it's rigged. Maybe it's your skill that is the reason for your chip loss? Personally I lose most my chips playing that slot. I'm ahead on chips playing poker, not a ton."
1912,David Belk,"January 5, 2020",2, Do not under any circumstances spend money on this game. The game is pretty rigged to make you lose your bank so you will have to spend actual money to build it back up. It's a fun game but BEWARE.
1913,Joseph Hernandez,"December 26, 2019",5," I love the experience, although I seem to lose chips in the worse way possible, maybe a one card straight or a one card flush which seems to happen alot in this game, unrealistic."
1914,Saad Kasdano,"January 11, 2020",5," It's so much fun, spin the wheel while you wait for your turn is such a fun way to get more money, I love the gifts and claiming it is so simple. Yes there are ads but what app doesn't. I'm learning how to play poker and I love it"
1915,James Farley,"November 14, 2019",5, Great game setup almost perfectly good way to spend some free time I just wish that you could send an unlimited amount of chips to any player other than that it's awesome !!
1916,Larry Rogers,"January 15, 2020",1," Very experienced in all areas of online and live casino gaming. The constant advertising is always ""in your face"", and seems to catch people into purchase situations when simply trying to navigate the minefield of advertisements. Horrible!"
1917,Eldon Hall,"February 1, 2020",2, Used to love the app. There is so much extra added that the experience and game isnt as enjoyable anymore
1918,Allison Baggett,"February 2, 2020",5, Love playing on this until you get the idiots the raise all the time with nothing. Its very frustrating.

1922,Bruce Sattler,"April 8, 2020",3," get rid of the chat, nor a real game"
1923,Joshua Byrer,"December 29, 2019",2, I like poker but the barrage of ads every time you go to the main menu is terrible. 6 full screen popups advertising different chip purchasing packages every time I want to play the game is why I don't want to play the game.
1924,Taylor Wolf,"January 4, 2020",5," Needs more faster way of to tell what you had if everyone folds because if you tell, it can throw people more off but takes to long type it in a show card or hide cards when everyone fold for the winner because it makes it in my mind more suspenseful and thrilling"
1925,Thomas Waggoner,"December 1, 2019",1," Most unreal hold em game you will play . The game operators do zero to monitor tables and allow it to be more like a bingo game .Your biggest competition will be the dealer ,with their ""random"" card dealing ."

1927,Pawan Poudyal,"December 24, 2019",2," The cards are not random, it's fixed. They let you win few times first but you start to lose chips soon. Its 100% biased. I won't put a dime on this app."
1928,Robert Hance,"January 14, 2020",5," Well-scripted, plenty of (free) money to be won without spending (real) money. Small ad-attack on main screen, nothing formidable. Lots of fish, but not WSOP's fault, just typical ""players"". All said, a good app."
1929,Luis Hernandez,"January 23, 2020",3," Great app I like it, gave it 3 stars because interrupting of the ads to many. I understand when I first open game but after I get out of a table to go to different table or game it's pretty annoying and sometimes upsets me I stop playing."
1930,jim comer,"February 18, 2020",5, Ejoyable and relaxing!!!!!!
1931,Magic Man,"March 20, 2020",5, Fun game even if your not a good poker player.
1932,Randy Plain,"April 6, 2020",5, Very good poker app to kill time.

1935,Ronnie Nelson,"February 3, 2020",5, Some how I've got 3 different games going with 3 different names I don't know how it happened but I would like some one to fix it for me what do I do about it
1936,Shadowhawk417,"January 3, 2020",4, Not easy to navigate the game. Would you please make the X's on chip sales more prominent? Also maybe have a more detailed learning platform something a player may use to go back and forth while first learning? Thank you
1937,William Stinnett,"November 24, 2019",1," Too many pop ups, seems to only deal winning hands if you buy chips. Lost to many times with 2 players holding full house hands. Yea I heard the random deal story already. About ready to uninstall game."
1938,Earl Fitzgerald,"November 9, 2019",1, Terrible app... Hands are not realistic... More like a slot machine set up... They make you pay for chips to get in the big tournaments... The more you pay the more you lose so you buy more ... Go to a different app to play
1939,Jake Christensen,"December 9, 2019",4," Great game, love it very much. However, I really dislike the advertisements that thrust themselves on me every time I go to the main lobby. It's very frustrating."
1940,Blake Elizalde,"November 7, 2019",4, Besides the fact of all the offers and news that pop up and you have to close before playing the game or when changing tables/screens. It's decent and kills time. Wish there were sit and go tournaments with turbo blinds.

1942,Mihai Voiculescu,"January 20, 2020",1, The game is nice and addictive but the problem is that as long as you progress and rise in the level you are forced to play at higher stake and higyer bet tables making you to loose and buy coins which is not normal they should allow you to play the bet level you want.
1943,Nick Henry,"January 27, 2020",5," Best NLH and Omaha app around. The format, the tournaments, the actual good players for the most part makes it the best poker app around to learn and overall become a better player which translates for me into the real world of cash games. WSOP poker is hands down the best poker app."
1944,pam boyer,"November 17, 2019",4, Hello. This poker site is getting better all the time. The only time I have issues is if the internet is slow or down. Thank you for a fun site!! I average play 1 hour a day. Love this game and site!! KSUWILDCAT
1945,colton curtis,"February 1, 2020",2, Love poker but this app is relentless with advertising for selling chips. Some advertising is not a problem but the way they do it is annoying af

1948,Neil Hopper,"March 31, 2020",4," Fun, but a little challenging"
1949,Gabriela Flores Jones,"November 15, 2019",2, Mega Bonus are too small. Hate the fact that one's stat downgrades. Cant play everyday all day and goes back down to J or Q. Work so hard to be a K and get to A and nothing. They should remain permanent.
1950,gorydeath,"November 22, 2019",4, Enjoyable. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is all the ads to get you to buy coins. I understand why they do it. Hope they understand why not 5 out of 5 stars
1951,Sharon Schuman,"December 22, 2019",3," The game is fun, but they present the slot machine as if it is free to play when it actually costs chips/money you have earned and they took approximately 18 million dollars of my earned chips/money."
1952,Wayne Scott,"November 8, 2019",2, since it updated yesterday I've got locked out of at least 5 hands and lost games I should have won and some tournaments when I try to play it just shuts the game right off. also never ending ads.
1953,Daniel Brinkley,"February 11, 2020",5, Great game teaching me a lot about how to play and bet
1954,Jeff Sawtelle,"January 6, 2020",1," Before you get this game, read all the negative reviews! This game is a jole. Way too many ads & its not fun. The otbers are far more realistic and graphics are way better!"
1955,Bud Decker,"January 30, 2020",2," Marginal - enjoyed it one day, the next it won't load saying it needs WiFi or 3g network both of which are available and working."
1956,Arlene Baker,"November 27, 2019",2," Not fun no matter which game you choose which table you go to, there will always always be that one or two who has the perfect hand over and over and over. And you sit there hand after hand for hours and maybe win one hand .this site is rigged!!"
1957,Jeff Crowley,"December 12, 2019",2, Game is rigged ......and cards do not fall as they should ......also they way people bet so much so fast there has to be cheat codes or something.....And i dont care what certs they say they have.....there is no way every hand is so low that only one person at the table gets anything
1958,Kevin O'Connell,"November 29, 2019",1, Just let me play the game instead of constantly diverting me to something else. Endless clicking out of side garbage. Takes a good 5 minutes until you actually get to a table.
1959,Matthew Ford,"December 4, 2019",2," My previous rating seems to have disappeared, so I'll write another. Love the game, but the pop ups are more annoying than an incurable rash."

1973,jamie hale,"November 10, 2019",4," Don't like the idea or theory that the flops,turns, and rivers are actually completely random. I personally don't believe that these situations are actually random"
1974,Tony Lenahan,"December 17, 2019",2," Way too many ads but other than that a good game. Update: Ever since the stupid candy canes it has been glitching. Tough to play when it constantly freezes on you, many times in a middle of a hand."
1975,Randy Gordon's,"November 24, 2019",1," It's not your fault that so many just act stupid in this game, but you should have something to help control the game better. You could add a review of the play on some that don't act right as the real game has."
1976,Mal Wreghitt,"December 4, 2019",1, Takes levels away when not able to play. Lost 4 levels over 24 hours. Not happy. Have lost more levels to the point I am not going to purchase any more chips.
1977,Mr Beast,"January 2, 2020",4, I like how it helps you when you need it say if should are not to the odds of the game you would like that if you don't really know how to play it it helped me win 12.000.000 in one day and I don't know how to play that good so it's really helpful for others that might wanna try
1978,Kristy Kieffer,"December 24, 2019",4, Really fun but no longer able to watch videos for coins so the I only get the four hour bonuses which makes it hard to play as much as I want without spending money.
1979,Justin R,"November 7, 2019",4, Loved this game for years. Too many pop up ads!! It's gotten really bad. Wish there was a way to pay to make it stop. I know when I want to buy chips.. stop forcing it down my throat! Thanks.
1980,John Puffer,"November 17, 2019",1, Have yet to play 10 hands and already tired of the game because of the notifications got 20 in less than 24 hours and your help link is locked got a chain symble on it so can't adjust it (if there is any) shame you can't even start to enjoy the game.
1981,Randy Haug,"November 16, 2019",3," It's good semi realistic like the human opponents that makes it fare, love the quick jump in, all in, players they make you rich fast! Good luck. I'M ALL INNNNNN!!!! Haahahaha 😂😁🤔"

1994,Robert Hopkins,"November 9, 2019",1, Nothing but an ad factory. If you're looking for realistic game play look elsewhere. Last hand I played had aces. Went all in pre flop. Got called by a 3 7 and a J 3 both off suite. 37 hits trips. Happens WAY too much to be random.
1995,Russell Pengelly,"February 3, 2020",2, Seems fixed to me especially when you make a purchase 🤔but good fun if you don't mind losing 😉

2000,Andrew Cameron,"November 30, 2019",2, When I'm winning and I have my momentum going it seems to kick me off and puts me out to the lobby after three different hands and I can't get my connection back on also that's way too many ads for things going on.
2001,Charlie Apostolakos,"December 5, 2019",2, Your programmer is the worst. Your allowing players with tons of chips play at the same table with player's who have much less. They overpower the bet and it takes away from any possible competition. You give players all these gifts and then take it all away.???
2002,Brett Ballentine,"February 11, 2020",4, Fun good play too many ads
2003,George Piche,"March 4, 2020",4, Good dependable satisfyingly game.
2004,Brian Gerth,"January 19, 2020",1, Algorithms are not right. Play for an hour and cant get any cards...while the same player continues to win over and over and over and over. Cant win unless you have the cards..

2010,Desmond Henderson,"December 8, 2019",1, Every single time I'm about to win a big pot after I've bet the majority of my money the whole app closes out but if I'm loosing it doesn't I have a brand new phone and it's done it on both new and old phones it seems to be rigged
2011,RD T,"February 12, 2020",4, Starting over learning game best in smartphone.
2012,Thomas Frank,"January 14, 2020",5," it's a great game. It has realistic scenarios occasionally where you have a great hand, and lose.........but it has happened to me before at the card table. I play daily.😁😎😏"
2013,rupak barman,"January 21, 2020",1, Your game algoritham is really horrible. Out if 100 hands every person gets maybe 2 chances of winning and getting a bigger hand which i figured out. Its not even fast paced and you call this random. And i think people who spend real money on the game are priotirized somehow.

2015,Phuck Diss,"January 22, 2020",5, This is a very unique app and gives you practice for when you do play for real money at most casinos. Has a good design and is easy to use 4 most. Is gaming system is overwhelming.
2016,Daniel Dalton,"November 18, 2019",5, To many popups to buy this or that I just want to play not cheat and there's no way to contact friends with private messages either I hope they fix both problems soon !!!!
2017,Bryan Scannell,"December 19, 2019",1," I am very disappointed, I ranked up to level Aces rank 5 or so, I spent over 100 dollars and had over 3 billion in chips.

2018,Ziekel Spears,"November 21, 2019",1, Ads popup all the time. When you login it pops at least 3.. then if you do daily blitz it makes you sit through the whole animation until you get to the pay option. I get too bored closing all the popups.
2019,Brenda Gunnoe,"November 30, 2019",4, Still wondering why I havent hit the golden wedge in the last 4 months. It either stops the one right before or the one right after. Happens every single time.

2021,TOUA TOUA,"March 1, 2020",5, Really fun and simple.
2022,Anthony Trejo,"December 25, 2019",1, Wsop is by far the worst texas holdem app when it comes to quality game play (ive played them all). Algorithms set up to deplete your chips in order to get you to purchase chip packages. Bunch of chip adds when you open the game or do one of their side games/free chips.
2023,Ferdinand Monares,"January 1, 2020",3, Ok game playing for free. I would NOT recommend buying chips/spending money. Their algorithm/random card generator is horrible. Very obvious that their algorithm is NOT random & is weighted.

2029,Norm Wilson,"April 17, 2020",5, Poker like usual but no all ins all the time
2030,Karen CR,"April 12, 2020",1," Too many bots, constantly rigged"
2031,A Google user,"December 30, 2019",5, I always have fun. I think all players should behave if they were actually playing in a public event. Their should be penalties for foul language and taking too long to act. For the most part a good time by all
2032,Karen Koinzan,"January 27, 2020",2, Very frustrating!!! I don't understand why they take such a big cut on every hand. And the tournaments. The payout for what is in is terrible! I would never spend money on the odds and the cuts they take out!!!
2033,Eric Bewley,"January 11, 2020",4," This game has really good mechanics, and I have not come across any bugs so far. The only thing I don't like about this game is that they ask you several different ways before each game, to buy chips."
2034,Gaz Carter,"November 13, 2019",2," Annoying really! Law of averages don't seem to apply and game rewards idiot all inners! No fun really, programming is atrocious and to many idiot humans! Nevertheless l will continue playing as it is a lil bit of fun when l find the right table!"

2038,Steven Shea,"February 7, 2020",3, Used to be better. Now more expensive to play. Payoffs are smaller.
2039,Lori Madzy,"December 30, 2019",1, I refuse to pay for chips I understand needing to make money but this game is not random played 4 hrs straight and had great hands with high percent of winning and the river is always in the opponent's benefit happens all the time not fun when you keep losing on good hands
2040,Jon Brown,"November 7, 2019",1," I was signed in as a guess and lost my status, money, everything!!! I paid for daily blitz and lost everything because of a glitch....Please return my money on my card or fix my status and info."

On the picture they show a wheel with extremely high prizes. You pay, and then surprise! You get a very normal spin. So I paid 4$ for prizes that I could've won in a single hand."
2042,William Marco,"November 19, 2019",2, I wish you had a way to gauge players an hands they play an rank a 1-5 level. Tired of trying to get better when no one wants to fold. Maybe you can make a other room for people for serious an want to get better.
2043,Andrew McManus,"December 1, 2019",3, Great poker and runs smoothly. Only put a 3 star because it has so many offers that pop up all the time and can be annoying.
2044,Robert Miller,"December 12, 2019",4, I love the game but the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because sometimes when you win things like the golden card or I signed up on my email and it was supposed to give me 500k I'd never received it in my account on the game

2046,trish Ashford,"December 18, 2019",3, Dont really enjoy losing all the time this is not a very enjoyable game and to many request to buy coins all the time at least 3 every time you change from one screen to another and when you exit
2047,Seif Eldeen,"December 19, 2019",1, Many problems any chips i win i don't get them my chips always the same that's why i stopped playing it from long time and it still have the same problem i won so much and i just noticed it like it's all just gone
2048,Eddee Sabrey,"January 19, 2020",2," Although fun and entertaining, you have no choice but to activate the PIG which pulls a portion of your winnings and then you have to pay to get what's already yours. Sometimes, a certain hand gets trumped by a lesser hand and loses the pot."
2049,k B,"January 31, 2020",3, Too many advertisements. I just want to play for fun and not buy every time I turn around.
2050,Rod Clowater,"February 14, 2020",5, Never played Texas holdem before. This is a great way to learn. Very exciting fun and relaxing

2059,Michael Higgins,"December 11, 2019",1," awful app rigged, every hand is either a straight or a flush absurd how often those two hit, pure bingo not even remotely close to realistic poker, and the tournaments are a joke don't waste your time playing this game it's rigged"
2060,Carol Lahr,"March 30, 2020",5, Love playing at all !levels. Thank you!
2061,Guy Ulrich,"November 20, 2019",5, I enjoy poker especially when its not costing real dough lol and i havent needed to spend very much on this game plenty of free chips just dont get to brave because after all it is poker and the river straights will get you every time.
2062,Rebecca Hults,"January 4, 2020",5," One of the better poker games out there. Different strategies used than in real life, obviously(I use different strategies anyways) but depends on the aggression of the other players."
2063,Scott Ouimet,"January 4, 2020",3, Would give 5 stars except that when I join a table I have to wait 2-3 hands before I get included so now I just go to lobby and exit the app when this happens wait sometimes till the next day to go back.

2077,Brandon Cool,"November 10, 2019",1, Worst game dynamics ever!!! Talk about a bad beat every time. Doesn't matter what you get on the flop someone will go runner runner on you 7 2 off and still beat you. If I could give less than one star I would
2078,Dan McLean,"November 12, 2019",3, What a waist of f'n time . Game restarts 10 times then reduces the free chips so you cant play. This makes you have to buy more to play . To many glitches.

2081,Anthony Williams,"December 5, 2019",1, The developer obviously doesint read reviews and just puts auto responses for the BS certification for random cards dealt. Find a new algorithm for handing out cards. I'm tried for going 30+ hands without getting a card higher then 8
2082,Liam Speiran,"December 15, 2019",3, I have been playing this game for years and do enoy it quite a bit but there needs to be rules regarding who should be able to play at certain tables. Like for instance if everyone at the table has $5-500M than you shouldn't allow someone who has $2B join that table
2083,Gabriel.Ornelas21,"January 19, 2020",5, Exceptional app and has a lot of good features and a lot of different game modes that I find enjoyable and I enjoy the amount of chips I get at the beginning that way I don't feel like I have to buy into playing this game
2084,Eric Stein,"January 29, 2020",2, Over all as a poker game It is exceptional the only downside is the amount of advertising in between games

2088,A Google user,"November 12, 2019",4, Love the game. Because I don't play with real money it does not feel the same when other players bet stupid. If they were playing with real money they would not go all in before the flop every time.
2089,A Google user,"March 24, 2020",5, Fun and challenging at times
2090,Graham Bright,"November 30, 2019",2," I had rated it higher. But now that I've invested my time and money, I've realized how quickly you lose status if you don't play every day. I think they need to have a better scale on how quickly you lose your status."
2091,michael Holmes,"March 17, 2020",5, Great game. Play is fun and quick.
2092,Lynn Jacobs,"November 8, 2019",1, Zynga is more exciting because donkeys don't win 90% of the time .I've built up 37 billion on zynga and can barely scrap by here with all the fish and your program that's set to help them so that real players are tempted to buy chips but I'll NEVER BUY chips ! Not for fake poker!
2093,Mass 21,"November 9, 2019",5, It's a good app for learning how to play poker. Every chance you will lose everything which I've done a few times. Makes the game realistic.
2094,Clint Ringel,"December 14, 2019",4, Yes I love the games fast past and free will play. It pisses me off that there is no redemption code that i can use or even where to find it.???
2095,Red Rum,"November 28, 2019",2, Game play is OK when you manage to stop being bombarded with popups trying to get you to pay to play... will use for the holiday boredom fix and then remove with extreme prejudice
2096,Mr. Elmer23,"December 2, 2019",3, The game experience is awesome and a great way to release some positive endorphins. This site is totally rigged. Set up for you to buy chips so they can make money.

2108,Kevin Doucet,"December 17, 2019",5, I've been playing this game for approximately two years and it's a lot of fun passes the time haven't spent any money on it at all everything I have this free takes longer to get your rings and everything I give it five stars
2109,Michael Cole,"November 11, 2019",1, Far too many pop-ups. I shouldn't have to x out half a dozen screens just to play your game. And you can delete my review as many times as you want. I'm just repost it.
2110,joe salley,"November 20, 2019",2, Fun game but getting out of hand with pop ups when you have to close out 7 separate attempts to get you to pay money everytime you open the app or go back to the lobby
2111,shawn kent,"November 23, 2019",1, Theres nothing random about this game. The cards are delt over and over again to keep people buying more chips from them. It's a money making app.

2114,micheal mattingly,"December 18, 2019",2," Game is ridiculous. The donkey players win more often than not. Not fun poker by far. And the pop ups are absurd, every time you change from one screen to another ."
2115,Scott Pettee,"December 23, 2019",4, Would give it a 5 but there are to many pop ups to purchase more money. Players are smart enough to either earn your money or pay for it without being reminded as to how
2116,Diana Ulissi,"December 29, 2019",2, Reason for 2 stars is that game does not stop closing and it's very annoying. Otherwise the game itself can be very fun and fun to collect so many bonuses etc
2117,Marquis Russ,"December 23, 2019",2, It's a fun game but you have to continously play it in order to keep your rank from dropping. I dont have the time to constantly play this game.
2118,Maid Mary,"January 8, 2020",1, This use to be my favorite game now as soon as my chips run out I'm uninstalling! Now you have to buy chips to keep your rank! Don't buy chips and you'll stay at the jack level FOREVER!

2125,Derek MacDonald,"December 21, 2019",3, The ads.... There are so many pop up ads. It's buttal. The game is good. The variations are fun but the ads make me close this game sometimes.
2126,Barbara Bird,"December 28, 2019",1, I never seen people in a real game were one guy gets a full house one way and the other the opposite way like I see on your poker site. U make people loose so they have to buy your chips. No more pal!!!!

It's clear that favours people that pay real money for game money. The best cards go to the same guys over and over. Was playing at a table, the same guy won 7 hands in a row and 4 of them with a ""straight"" (what are the odds?). Went from 400k to 7M. After that I just left the table. That was the most obvious case but if you pay attention it happens all the time. No fun at all."

2367,Harold Fries,"December 21, 2019",5, Crazy addicting game Except for the timer people take way to long to make a bet or fold that part I's frustrating Maybe make the timer quicker then this game is perfect Excellent job everyone involved with wsop
2368,Tom Bell,"January 8, 2020",1," It initially played like real poker then after reaching level III ace and receiving a wsop bracelet it now plays as if it is rigged. For the last several weeks can't win once in 20 to 30 hands. My guess, this is their way of trying to sell chips. Proof...the 15 plus friends are not winning either."

2378,Nick Cekorich,"January 17, 2020",5," If you like playing Texas Holdem, this is the place to do it. The cards are dealt just like your playing in a real game. If you play right you will win big.

2384,Robert Fissel,"January 8, 2020",3," Good poker app, but harrassing people with constant ads is annoying and takes away from the user experience."
2385,lonny wright,"January 9, 2020",5, Good place to start playing again Needs to be a little faster and keeping more players at the table

That's proof to me that they cheat. The reason why they do it is to keep you chasin until you have to buy more chips. It's a dirty tactic in what's supposed to be a fair game. Just another way to get upset when its supposed to be fun. Save your time and money for a real live game. Where atleast it's not fake.

Wasn't even a fan of Texas holdem til I ended up on this app. The only complaint that I would have would be the chat capabilities aren't what I'd like them to be and there's no private messages at all... So even tho I have friends on the app and can send and receive gifts from / to them I can't communicate one on one with them at all... Other than that I adore the wsop app.

3737,David Albright,"January 2, 2020",1," This app sucks,1 out of about 25-30 hands is all you will win unless u spend actual money to buy their chips,random dealing my ass,people are not stupid!!"
3738,Stephen Biggs,"January 18, 2020",4," Man I'd love to give this a five star. But usually with these games, once you do be prepared to spend 100$ a week or lose your ass off.

3739,Gilbert Contreras,"January 24, 2020",5, Its entertaining and you learn to identify winning hands faster.
3740,Jonathan Bermudez,"February 1, 2020",1, This game is obnoxious with advertisements pushing for you to make purchases. Everytime you leave a table to go to another you have to refuse a half a dozen ads from them trying to push purchases. Terrible experience
3741,Keli Geraty,"February 12, 2020",5, Challenging and fun

3745,Nicholas Gilbert,"April 24, 2020",5, Fun game good to learn poker
3746,Jamie Last,"April 25, 2020",1," Load of rubbish. Just constantly spams you with pop ups for in game purchases. Not one or two, but literally dozens. Not worth the hassle."
3747,A Google user,"February 7, 2020",5, Easy to play and I love the fact you can compete at all levels without having to spend any real money. Try it. Bet you will like it! I have been playing WSOP for over a year and it remains my favorite diversion. If you love poker or want to learn you have to try it!
3748,Michael Shotack,"November 7, 2019",5, Wish their was a way to single out griefers but i love this game

Just beware of spending your money. I took advantage of an offer to get 30 million chips for $5.99. Then a little later I took advantage of an offer to get a bunch of chips to register my email address, but while I got a few thousand chips for that, the 30 million chips I purchased went away. I filled a claim with a copy of my receipt with customer service, but never got a response."

I declined and clicked on a game and was again redirected. The first TEN times in a row I tried to play, they tried to force me to spend money. No thanks. I would like to at least try the game first and be sharked in by the easy wins. Then start pushing me to buy chips before you switch the easy win mode to we got your money now fool, you will never win again mode."
