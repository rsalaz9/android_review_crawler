As a lover of lists RTM allows me to prioritise, order and repeat tasks. And with the Pro version it syncs across phone, tablet and PC's so if a task come to mind, whenever or whereever I am I can quickly add to RTM and trust it will be in the right place for when I need to do that task."
1,Eric Wootan,"April 23, 2020",4," I have search the world over and tried many free versions of task manager/list tools. RTM is my favorite, so far. I'm also a novice GTD practitioner and RTM has really helped me improve my processes. This app would get 5 stars for one additional feature that it now lacks - GRID interface!"
2,Meg Konkol,"April 15, 2020",1," I stopped using this program because it didn't suit my needs. There is no way in the program to cancel the subscription, so I've twice been charged $40 for the pro account while not using the program. There needs to be a way to cancel the account that isn't buried."
3,Phillip Solano,"April 26, 2020",4," Extremely useful, but not entirely user friendly. Several key features have to be done on the website, rather than on the app itself. I want to be able to share lists with others within the app ad not have to go to the main site."
4,Winter Drake,"April 23, 2020",4," Definitely the best to do list app. too bad the logo looks like it was made in MS Paint. Removing one star because it asks me to rate it every day even though i click ""yes, rate"" every time and it should know that I've already rated by now."
5,Jimmy Shipp,"April 10, 2020",4," I like it! But I whisper I could turn off the automatic due date when I'm entering a task.

For instance, say today is Friday and I want a reminder for tomorrow and Sunday to take ""X"" to work on Monday. So I enter a task to take ""X"" to work on Monday. But the app enters a task to take ""X"" to work, but it doesn't appear on my task list until Monday. I'm my case, this is a problem since I'm usually already at work before I look at my task list. But otherwise, it meets my needs very well!"
6,Lisa Arthurs,"March 30, 2020",4," Hoping the developers will enable users to select and drag line items to wherever they choose on each list.

Currently, only options are alphabetical (default) & high priority. I imported lists from Wunderlist & I lost my list order on several. Also, you have to pay for premium service to gey features that were free on Wunderlist. However, the app is user-friendly."

The browser version is alright, but the mobile version is bad... Please fix these mistakes."
8,Filippo Salustri,"April 10, 2020",4," Great, reliable service. The UI is a little clumsy, but robust. A little lacking on the high end for power users but overall an excellent app. I've used all the popular apps, but I keep coming back to RTM."
9,Gymanhe Hustle,"April 12, 2020",3, On the fence if I will keep this app. Why? I have found other services rendered Inna expensive on my pocket. And it was not engross enuff two where I gotta have this app and all its features. Why even on the fence? The update.
10,Alex Ekwall,"April 8, 2020",5," This app has proven to be incredibly helpful and the free version offers plenty of features, which is more than can be said of some other apps. I wish I had found this earlier. Anybody with a busy schedule could probably benefit from this app."
11,Mike Young,"March 17, 2020",3," As I've been using Milk, it's an adequate tool for creating and maintaining task lists. I suspect it has the capability of being better than merely adequate, but the tips and videos I've seen so far have not helped me get there."
12,Jeff Trombly,"March 8, 2020",5," This app has every bell and whistle needed to stay on top of all my plans and tasks. But at the same time, it's easy and intuitive to use. I especially like the ease of getting a thought into the inbox and not having to worry about remembering what it was I wanted to remember!"
13,Krys Kelly,"March 20, 2020",5," I have used several of these over the years and, after the initial enthusiasm, my usage faded away. But the availability across all my devices, the very intuitive interface and nice features (e.g. tags, colour coding) means that Remember The Milk is really working for me."
14,Wes Poteet,"April 9, 2020",5," Very nice tool. Lots of flexibility. I was looking for a good list management tool and RTM exceeded my expectations. PC enabled, adding items by email, bulk updates... Excellent product."
15,Евгений Путиенко,"March 5, 2020",5," Great app with a lot of useful features. Tasks could be assigned to lists, tagged, commented and more - this all in free version. Also, it's possible to create repeatable tasks."
16,Chloe Wolanski,"March 3, 2020",5," I've been struggling to keep organized, but this app really does help to keep me on track! Especially the bit where it emails things directly to my dumb face so I can't forget them. :'D"
17,Michael Sheets,"March 20, 2020",5," Use it for a prioritized list of work and personal items. Pretty quick to learn and now I can jot down tasks on the fly, anywhere and keep better organized. Loving it so far!"
18,Bobbi Jo,"February 26, 2020",4, This would be the perfect tool for my life except there's no option to view tasks in calendar mode. gcal and Outlook lack any customization of what to show or not so I don't find them viable for this purpose.
19,Hassan Elmousallamy,"March 1, 2020",4," What I like the most is that it sends reminder ""emails"". What I'd like to see different is a simplified or customized interface for adding new tasks"
20,Eric Eldridge,"March 1, 2020",5," The app is pretty good and a very good standalone, but what sets remember the milk apart for me is the seamless transition between phone app and using online in the browser. This has every feature I could want and is a fantastic product"
21,Foxie Frankie,"March 8, 2020",5," Love this app, easy to use, just open and jot down things to remember anytime and can set the date and time for reminders. I use it every day"
22,Kyle B,"February 28, 2020",3," I wish the free version had the ability to schedule tasks with reminders. Besides that, it has lots of features and a pleasant layout and theme."
23,Hmoob Crafting,"April 9, 2020",5," Very good app! Keeps you on tasks, never had any problems with this app at all."
24,G G,"April 3, 2020",4, I prefer Wunderlist but given Microsoft bought it to close it down its no longer an option. Otherwise this is one of the two best also rans
25,Torbs Tel,"March 2, 2020",5, I love it! Like the email to task import feature and the great flexibility of the smart lists. Good job!
26,Ximena Vivanco,"April 25, 2020",1, I couldn't even sign up!! It says that my username is not available and I tried with several...such a waste of time
27,David Ross,"April 8, 2020",5, Great app! Intuitive and minimal interface which still offers feature-rich task keeping.
28,Giles Murray,"March 13, 2020",2, Functional but incredibly irritating! As soon as we find a better one were gone!
29,Bronwen Bartlett - LJC Media,"March 17, 2020",5," The design is nice, it's user friendly and a great replacement for Wunderlist for those who don't want to use MSToDo."
30,Sand Wurm,"March 30, 2020",1, Not an alternative for Wunderlist... To complex and missing simple function (recurring shopping list)
31,Baljeet Singh,"February 19, 2020",2," Hello, I am unable to login on my tablet. Whenever I try to login it crashes. Please advise."
32,Rebecca Fortes,"March 7, 2020",1, Would not let me sign in or create a log-in. Tried many times then finally deleted app in defeat.
33,Cherie Sears-Thompson,"March 1, 2020",5, Love that my To Do list is always updated on all my devices and so easy to add to.
34,Lauren Sellers,"March 6, 2020",5," Love, love, love this app. It's easy to use yet versatile. Great job!"
35,Heather Burris,"April 7, 2020",5, Helps keep me on task! Integrates well with website.
36,Jeremy Papke,"March 4, 2020",3," Paywall, and doesn't sync correctly between web and phone."
37,bianselong,"April 23, 2020",5, Awesome app to manage my work tasks as a busy business developer!
38,Ron Christiansen,"March 2, 2020",5," I would not want to be without Remember the Milk, have been using for a number of years and it really keeps organised."
39,Scott Walters,"February 21, 2020",5," I'm a refugee from Toodledo. This app is just as powerful, but more modern and elegant. I love this app. Thank you."
40,Kate,"March 11, 2020",4," Very good app, but wish it had some mindmap functionalities"
41,Mary Hamer,"March 23, 2020",5," Intuitive and easy to understand, Remember The Milk is very helpful in my day to day life!!"
42,Nancy Green,"March 25, 2020",2, 3 clicks to check off an item...sad. Cant share lists via the app...sad
43,Edward Ndukui,"March 1, 2020",5, Just perfect for handling any kind of tasks.
44,Gustavo Bonato,"March 5, 2020",4, Good stuff. Nice to integration with Gmail
45,Amirreza Shakori,"February 16, 2020",5," The best to do app I've ever seen. I'm sure once you try it, you can't stop using it. Tnx for your great app."
46,Dave Roberts,"March 22, 2020",5, Author is responsive to bug reports
47,Andrew Fischer Lees,"April 22, 2020",5, Smooth smooth smooth. Does everything it should
48,Jared Miller,"February 10, 2020",5," Great app, if the widgets break, just restart the phone"
49,Shamina Kwon,"April 25, 2020",2, Where do completed task go to? Did i miss something? Not very intuitive
50,Irene Wells,"March 1, 2020",5," Perfect for organizing my life. From simple notes to planing a vacation, it keeps my mind on task. Love it!"
51,Hannah DeBoer,"March 11, 2020",5," Easy to use, no limits"
52,Jillian Gregory,"March 4, 2020",4, Enjoying using this app. Easy to use.
53,Corrine Goldberg,"March 2, 2020",5, It is so helpful to remember things.

If you make, say, a shopping list, it takes multiple steps to check off the items. And checked off items disappear after 7 days in the free version. I used WL as my weekly shopping list. You could easily go through the checked off items and uncheck them to add them back to the list. RTM will not save me time at all."

I like that it is already separated out with 2 categories of personal and professional, I did not have to set those up. Sometimes I need a little bit of a parameter for use already in place before I take off running with an app, task or project. I also like that I can assign tasks to others in a simple manner."
58,Nicola Chin,"January 6, 2020",4," Good so far, I have limited reasons for using the app so i don't use every feature available, but the clean, simple format is great.

Repetition made it clear, but it'd be nice if there was a key of sorts for the symbols in Help."

The central smart list philosophy works for me as I like to slice and dice my tasks in various ways. The Android app is solid and mimics the desktop interface with some nice layout management to deal with the reduced real estate on mobile devices. The best thing I can say about the app is that I really don't think about it that much.
60,Elise and Philip Irminger,"January 29, 2020",5," This is an excellent app. One thing I would like to see is the option to repeat the task from a start date vs a due date. Making the bed and other daily tasks are repeated, but not exactly ""due"". I think this feature would be great."
61,Christopher Tripp,"January 24, 2020",5," As a Product Manager by trade using more 'complex' task management tools, RTM works great for my personal task management needs.

It has an interface that isn't cluttered and helps you focus on what matters. It's easy to use straight out of the gate but also has plenty of extra features that provide value w/o confusion, too. Only features I'm waiting for that personally would make it close to perfect is an ability to add dependencies on related task and be able to track actual task time spent"

I was using an alternative Wunderlist but after hearing it has been taken over by Microsoft and they plan not to sync with GOOGLE CALENDAR I am mainting all my organisation with RTM.

64,Martin Tapp,"January 28, 2020",5, Very easy to use and I like the power of the tools to set up smart lists and define repeating tasks by multiple different time scales.
65,Steven Zehren,"January 26, 2020",5," I'm enjoying the app so far. I love how I can set up separate folders. With work and home, I frequently travel among three separate towns. I have a folder for each town, which helps me remember the tasks I'm supposed to do in each place. Looking forward to learning more about what this app can do."
66,John Curtin,"December 13, 2019",5," really good. simple to use no overkill with 100s of useless 'functions'. just does what u need. We've been using it in company now for two years and I'm still more than happy with what it does, especially in a group coworker setting."
67,John Scarbrough,"February 5, 2020",1, love it...very helpful for those of us who like and use lists... changed to 1 star. Can't delete old list items.
68,Bob A,"December 24, 2019",5," An excellent multi-platform task/to-do app with lots of options for repeating tasks etc. It's a pity that the free version doesn't include an option for reminders on the phone, but apart from that's it's great."
69,Dan Coyer,"December 10, 2019",3," Looks a lot nicer since last time I tried it. Buy I cannot get the notification to alert me in any way out side of emails,or text messages, which personal does not work for me. Just want the app to notify me."
70,Shabuj Alp,"January 13, 2020",5, It is one of the best to & organizing software in android if you can use it. I suggest to make folder according to your task category and then put everything according to category. It might be little difficult to define task hicharchy but it is amazing after you have learned it.
71,Brian Hickey,"February 16, 2020",4, Really like this. Short learning curve. Runs well on Android. 😁
72,Michael Patterson,"November 30, 2019",4," Good app except it won't notify me for my daily reminder. Only notified me once and when I tapped the notification it disappeared and nothing happened. It didn't even say what the reminder was, just the name of the app. What's going on?"

This app has worked well for me for both shopping lists and ""to do"" lists. It is user friendly and easy to get used to. However, I wish the ""Completed"" items would not disappear. I wish they would change color or be crossed out and go to the bottom. I often purchase the same items and complete the same tasks, and it would be nice to just uncheck them when I needed to complete them again."
75,Amy Cabrera,"January 14, 2020",4," Not a bad app. The widget is very weak. No font customization, hard to read with small font and no differentiation between due date and task in list. Plus you can't check off task from widget."

Just a basic reminder should be free. If you want multiple reminders, different types of reminders, etc then I understand charging. But a basic-one time-pop up on my screen reminder on a to-do list should be included in a free app, otherwise a free to do list app is useless. There are a lot of apps that provide that for free so I'm deleting this one. I'm sure if you have a complicated schedule and need an intricate app this would be fine. But for basic reminder it isn't worth it."
77,Joan Liut,"December 18, 2019",5, It's helpful. I would like more control over how the tasks are ordered when Ifirst view my list in the morning. I have to reorder things everyday. Four and a half stars.

That includes not only  a normal todo-list of everyday tasks, but also a list of movies you'd like to see, a list of ideas you came up with, a list of articles you'd like to read, a wishlist for your family members, a list of home improvement projects, etc etc. You get the point. No other app does this. All the other apps in some way assumes that everything on your list needs to be done in the near future and isn't that complicated.  Also, this app has ALL THE FEATURES. It supports *multiple levels* of subtasks which are full-blown tasks with their own reminders and notes. It supports adding items with natural language. It supports tags in addition to lists. It supports sharing. I really don't know what else you can ask of a todo-list app. Some people might find it all too complicated, in which case this is not the app for you, but other than that I don't know why you wouldn't use it."
80,L. Edwards,"November 16, 2019",1, The app doesn't synchronise properly with my phone. The app sets tasks as due yesterday even though I've set them on the PC to tomorrow. When I check the app the PC sets the tasks to yesterdsy. It's hopeless. Uninstalling.
81,Bryon McElwee,"January 11, 2020",5," Has been quite useful to track links via the mobile app, browser, and desktop application. Would highly recommend and very helpful, even without paying for the premium features"

91,A Google user,"March 3, 2019",5," An excellent app. Collaborative, multiple lists, syncs well, editable, and all without requiring a PhD in app-ology like so many apps. I imagine the paid upgrade is even better, if possibly more complicated, but I don't know. Not a note taking app, per se, but I sometimes use it to make notes."

It is a good single point for tracking and (sort-of) organizing my tasks and projects. The categories are helpful, but not as useful as I would like.

Wanted to upgrade but the yearly renewal a little expensive. Only need the widgets but there are no different pricing models.
110,Дух Солнца,"June 12, 2019",5, Great app! Am using it every day to manage myself & my business. Useful to jot down tasks and follow GTD process. A suggestion for the future: If you can make an integration with Google Maps & a chrome extension to quickly add tasks that would be awesome. Thank you for the app!
111,Brooke Cao,"January 7, 2020",5, Best to do app ever. Been using it for years. A perfect balance between features and not being cumbersome to use.
112,Pete Carstensen,"May 16, 2019",4, My wife and I really like Remember the Milk since it allows us to share lists. Often we think of something we need so RTM allows us to make a note so the next time we are in the store we are reminded. Have some problems with the current version on my Galaxy 9+ with the app crashing tho
113,Sarah Miller,"September 22, 2018",5, At first I was sceptical of this app being any different to a handwritten to do list. I was wrong. The fact that you can tag tasks and amend them makes it so much more than that. Best of all are the e-mails that remind you of any tasks that are set to be done that day.
114,Miroslav Jakab,"July 4, 2019",2," The free version has so many limitations, it doesn't seem to be useful for me in any way. The thing I miss the most are reminders set to a specific time.

120,Cuong Nguyen,"September 7, 2019",4," the app is great in general. It has features that support schedueling, events managing, task giving and receiving.

121,Arek Kaźmierowski,"December 2, 2018",3," I'm using it with subscription, but constantly looking for a replacement. One big problem is reminders - very complicated system to use, and at the end they ""forget"" to remind you anyway. This should not happen for the money you pay."

532,Anthony Kubicki,"April 23, 2020",5, Best free reminder software I've used. No limit on number of words so I use it for all sorts of self development reminders and it has very flexible repeat settings
533,Peter Allen,"April 27, 2020",4," I've tried many to-do list apps (Todoist, Wunderlist, Tick-Tick, Toodledo, nTask, MLO, etc, etc), and RTM is now the choice for me.

542,Nick O'Donovan,"February 25, 2020",4, Had RTM for years. It is excellent. Extremely versatile and Smart Lists are great. The locations reminders are not totally reliable and the ability to only store 1 URL for a reminder is a shame. Otherwise I'd have had no hesitation but to score 5 stars.
543,A Google user,"March 1, 2020",5," I've used it daily for two years. Indispensable. Update: I've now used it daily for ten years. Does every thing I need without trouble, handles subtasks better than any other app I've tried (I've tried almost all)."

Really flexible for repeated tasks, with powerfull tasks filtering engine. I can only recommend it from functional point of view. However, the mobile client needs some small UI update here and there and the web application needs much more that just a small update - it is cluttered, unreadable, overreacting and not on par with current UI/UX standards. It is also one of the most expensive task management apps. There are better alternatives out there."
561,A Google user,"August 27, 2019",3," Invaluable, as long as I don't have to cross into another time zone. When you do, appointments that occur on a date rather than date+time are moved a whole day because of a flaw in the way the app deals with all day events."
562,Erica Strand,"November 27, 2019",5, I've been using Remember the Milk for a long time and I can't imagine a more efficient productivity tool. The app makes RTM very convenient to use. I wouldn't be able to stay on top of my to do list without it!

574,Mike N,"December 15, 2019",1, $39.99 A YEAR?!? Are you bloody kidding me! You have to be flaming nuts to believe I'd pay that just to get a widget. Stuff that... Uninstalled!

I'm amazed at how the app can accommodate anything from the simplest shopping list to complex shared projects without any compromise in usability. It's sophisticated without being complicated. I came back to this after shopping around. Paid version is most versatile and useful to me pricier than I remember it being but still worthwhile.
645,brad mckuhen,"May 16, 2019",5," This is by far the best app to manage a disparate collection of random information, wrestle it into shape and form, and still have your sanity by the end of the day. Tags and lists, along with smart tagging, have helped evolve how I run everything from grocery runs to full blown projects."
646,Matt Miraglia,"May 22, 2019",3," Simply and effective. I would give it more, but I have no idea why the pro version is so expensive. I would pay 20 for the pro as this is a great app, but 40 bucks seems crazy for an app this sime."
647,A Google user,"May 15, 2019",5," I wish reminders were included in the free version, but other than that I love rtm. I've used it on and off for years, but always come back to it after trying other todo tools."

650,Karen Pheasant,"May 15, 2019",5, Easy to use and great functionality. I use the paid version so that changes sync immediately across applications - the daily sync in the free version was frustrating!
651,Patrick LaVictoire,"May 13, 2019",5," Still not perfect, but better for me than the alternatives. Good power user features. Clumsy interface for adding notes."

656,Aleksandr J. Smoliakov,"June 3, 2019",5," One of my favourite apps. I use it to keep various tasks, shopping lists, event reminders, etc. all in one place. It syncs with web UI that is accessible on desktop. App UI itself is quite intuitive."

Flexible enough for me to develop my own system, reliable and nicely designed. Tech support is extremely responsive.

It makes it very easy to see upcoming deadlines etc."
692,yusak rustandi,"November 7, 2018",5, The best free feature to do list. I want to buy license but its too expensive. Can you set about $10 per year only for reminder notifications? I don't need all features. And you know the forex is very unstable right now. You must make price level for each feature. It will be more profitable.

for a lot of unused features."

keyboard shortcuts and predictive typing are incredible, and the rest

like Todoist and Moo.do, but they don't come close to RTMs grouping

allowing me to open the app got a favorite project instead of showing me 
all tasks all the time. Synchronization is immediate and seamless. I really 
have looked at other options, but can't find anything that matches RTMs 
ability to let me get things done with a minimum of tasks and without any 
friction."
791,Lucy Ding,"June 10, 2018",5," Pretty good so far. What I like is that the team are continuing to develop 
the app. It's got good features already and ongoing development. This isn't 
something you're going to pour your time into setting up but then it 
disappears due to lack of developer support"

Jive, which shut down, so this was an easy switch. I wish that the color 
coding was available in the free version, and also wish you could share 
labels with other collaborators and not only lists. (Sometimes it's easy to 
label/tag a new item/task but forget to also put in a list--in which case 
the collaborator won't be able to see it.) I feel like the Pro membership 
is too expensive--would be nice to have a mid-level option with some 
upgraded features which is not as extensive or expensive as the Pro version."
798,Christine J Jones,"June 24, 2018",4," Works great for me, reminding me what needs to be done. The only thing I'd 
change is to be able to turn off reminders to my mailbox. If it's in there 
I haven't found it."
799,A Google user,"May 30, 2018",5," Setup brilliantly and the closest I've got to Things on Android. Runs very 
simply if you want it to but if you have a more complex to do list or want 
to include others then it allows additional layers."

803,A Google user,"July 21, 2018",5," I originally got this app because my LG Fiesta's reminders wouldn't work 
properly. Now that I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, I decided to keep the app 
anyway because it was great at reminders."
804,Greg Davies,"June 14, 2018",4," I use this app to track my appointments, shopping lists, recurring bills to 
pay, books to read, birthdays and much more. The UI is a little clunky when 
adding/editing tasks."

pay version anyway."

can all keep track of each other's appointments and tasks as well."

freelance work. Can't live without it."
810,meg anderson,"August 13, 2018",5," Intuitive and useful. I love the option to repeat a task at any interval I

Best app for to do lists. So great and easy to use. Love it!!!"
926,Josh Peyton,"May 16, 2018",5," Excellent for to do lists and the widgets are very good for quick adding

widgets, I don't even have to open app to see list."
930,Rachael Kenney,"May 20, 2018",4," Great app, I just wish there was a setting to cross off items when they are 
completed rather than having them disappear"
931,Billy Young,"May 3, 2018",5," The cow is back on the icon, so five stars! Great app!"
932,Louis Thegreat,"May 16, 2018",5," Great app. Undo function would be appreciated when a task has been 
completed by mistake."

RTM and lose the goofy cow?"

query but no reply."

through."
936,A Google user,"May 28, 2018",4, Think it's a good app but the pro app's annual fee is on the expensive side.

without it."
938,Guilherme Utrabo,"May 18, 2018",5, Rtm is amazing. Can't live without it

I made lists for all but my teen who has his own account, and it's so helpful in keeping track of what has and hasn't been done yet. For my teen, it gives him a guided independence as he learns to take initiative for his productivity. I can give tasks to my contacts, so when there's something I need him to do that's not on his own list, I can just send it to him. I like how we can sign dates, times, and repetition to the tasks. We can also easily postpone a task."

971,Michele DrpOpZ,"February 13, 2018",4," Neat. 4/5 cause swiping feels buggy: I understand that swiping requires a minimum speed to be successfully triggered, but you should do something to fix the animation when it doesn't. At the current time If you try to slide slowly over a task either left or right you get this behavior."
972,Ariba Siddiqi,"April 12, 2018",4," The only reason I haven't given this full 5 stars is because of the time 
limit on the sync function of the app. That makes it slightly less 
portable. It would also be nice to have the actual widgets available 
without needing to sign up for Pro."

Can also send that set of tasks, or any individual tasks, to another user.  Only bit I wish was better: a graphical view of tasks in progress based on start due and due date would be good (Gantt chart) but maybe I am expecting too much.  It needs self discipline to keep using it and keep it up to date, but so far it has lasted the test of time better than anything else I have tried."
975,Carobt Artist,"January 26, 2018",5," Everything is fine. Except that one time where, because I'm so used with the app, I bulk edit all my task for due today.

977,Andrea Bishop,"January 25, 2018",4," Just got the Pro version, which is nice. The app doesn't seem to have all of the bells and whistles though - can't change tag colours, and no subtasks. It's still a solid app, and the web version is great!"
978,Julie deBurgos,"January 22, 2018",5, Haven't been using it more than a few weeks but so far it is great. Simple to learn and use. Especially compared to some other popular apps that are so complicated I felt like I needed to take a course. So I reccomend giving the free version a try.

I like hitting check boxes instead of swiping, sometimes I accidentally swipe off a task when I am swiping for the side menu. To add a subtask, you have to hit the + button, select subtask, type subtask then hit save then repeat. With to-do you just tap the subtask, type and hit enter to add another. You end up saving two steps each time. Wunderlist is more complete if you want to share tasks and so forth. Its not a bad app but it's not for me. I feels it's a bit clumsy. Sorry!"
980,Halle Markwas,"April 8, 2018",4," Great app for a new mom. Only thing I wish is that when I opened it it defaulted to showing only today's tasks instead of all, so it doesn't overwhelm me!"
981,Andrew Collins,"February 8, 2018",5," Being using for years. Love the flexibility of the smart lists. As with all task managers, requires you to regularly review to ensure your goals are aligned. Would struggle to function without it."

Had a dry erase board mounted in the kitchen and the kids would write down anything they needed, I would add it to the list, and erase as I went.  I used the basic account the 1st year and then upgraded to a paid plan, I don't anticipate leaving, it has dropped stress, it's worth it."

The ability to assign priority, date, category (list), AND multiple tags to a task makes it more flexible and easier to use than the competing apps that I've used. Being able to sort lists in various ways + drag-and-drop tasks --  including the mobile version -- makes it even more user-friendly.

Have tried several, including the most sophisticated and pricey, which was very good but required a dedication I couldn't afford, to get the most out of it. When I needed to bring others in, almost all were more trouble than they were worth.  So I decided to take another look at what was out there and decided to give RTM a try instead of passing it by as I did originally as one that might not have the ""Steam "" I needed. Well, was I surprised. Good thoughtful design wins every time, apparently. RTM is handling everything I need it to do, easily, including multiple teams. Don't be fooled by ""sophisticated"", dense interfaces, look for the one that provides exactly what's needed, without excess overhead that drags on what you're trying to accomplish. And, don't forget the milk, KWL"

1268,Michael Springer,"August 27, 2017",5," Very easy to use, perfect for my needs. I used to forget the milk all the time, but haven't done so once since installing this. Now if only someone could create a 'Remember the Eggs' app, I might be able to save my marriage"

At least, that's only if they had the same things applied to Subtasks. Nested tasks feel much more like a hack into the system and using them feels clunky.  My personal gripe also includes the lacking control over email imports. I've contacted them as a Pro user over a particular issue and they don't have plans to fix it anytime soon.  So again, RTM works so long as your first impressions is nice enough, because it's not clear what they're ever working on."

I installed this to test sharing a shopping list with my partner. It turns out you can't share lists from the app. Viewing permissions on a list has a learn more link to their website which returns a 404.  It does let me share a single task. That doesn't end up being useful for a shopping list though as you can only mark tasks as complete and add text notes. There are no checklists that apps like Trello or Google keep provide.  It seems like there is no simple lightweight way of just having a shared checklist in the way that Google keep provides.
1272,Eve Olson,"September 10, 2017",5," This app is extremely useful for to do lists. I can tag tasks and this organize them by parts of my life, and then I can either see all tasks by date or by category. This app helps me manage anxiety by allowing me to feel in control and organized. And the cow is cute 🐄"
1273,Kevin Achenba,"July 26, 2017",1, If someone has the paid version and you don't it's a real pain to work with them. Things like subtasks will be hidden from you. Why hide basic functionality?
1274,Lori Twining,"September 3, 2017",5, I just use it for simple to do lists.  I break this down onto categories such as personal and work related items.  You can also set priorities.  It works well and smoothly.

1276,Shawn Brady,"September 11, 2017",1, Just needed a checklist app. It wants me to sign up. Why? Don't need the hassle. I'll find an app that actually works instead of this P.O.S.
1277,Kbirds,"October 9, 2017",5, I've been using this app for years. Have really been relying on it for the last several months. I use it for those oh so regular household duties. Love how it cross polinates from phone to tablet to computer.

I installed the free version and really liked the interface and tagging etc. However I found reminders missing as a no-go situation because just for reminders and subtasks you wouldn't so high a price every year. My suggestion is to have two levels of prices at least. Unless the strategy itself is to keep user base low, I don't why I should pay a very high price for the simpler essential features like reminders. Not for me. I have moved onto another app that less pricier but has good enough features."
1280,Dima K,"July 31, 2017",2," Wasn't impressed by free version. It's more like a demo, not really usable. If you don't plan to buy the app and still  searching for simple and powerful list app, look elsewhere."

1284,Soji Ogunnaike,"September 20, 2017",5, Amazing app. Was initially skeptical due to its name (yeah bite me). But it is as professional as the competition.
1285,Sean Lawrence,"July 21, 2017",5," It makes checklists, but not in the sense of grocery lists, in the sense of to do lists. The things I really like are the ability to make reports (i.e., what have I done in the last week) and the fact that it runs on nearly everything. Really handy."
1286,A Google user,"September 20, 2017",5," I've used it primarily for shopping lists and found it most helpful. I will be exploring other features in the near future, although, after a cursory look, it seems to be quite diverse in its capabilities."

1422,A Google user,"June 18, 2017",5," I use ordinary lists for my ""projects"" and smart lists for my contexts by using tags for each context as well as Next Action. Combined with the web interface, RTM keeps me Getting Things Done wherever I am."
1423,Philip Carpenter,"June 12, 2017",1," Rather more complicated than I needed. It requires you to create an account and log in.

1427,rituraj gogoi,"June 23, 2017",5, It's a simple and intuitive app that lets you do what it is built for. Easy to add reminders and to action them post completion. Definitively recommend it to one's who need a simple and easy to use reminder app

I've been using RTM since the beginning and I've been a pro user almost as long. I like being able to set reminders via email, including ""assigning"" Outlook tasks to it. It needs an updated Android-specific pop-up option (STILL, 2017)  It worked better on BlackBerry OS 6 &10; I'd like to see some more work put into the Android version (same comment two years later)."

Unfortunately, they raised the price to around $40US. For what it does this too expensive especially when you convert to Canadian. So I will not be renewing my subscription and move on to something else."
1585,Chantal Gautreau,"March 30, 2017",4, Great app! The only thing that's missing is a way to see when you cross items off your list. I always find it more motivating to see how much I'm getting done in a day.
1586,A Google user,"March 19, 2017",5," Our household has been using RTM for years now! The shared lists are really great. And with lists and tags, you can get really organized. It's a really full featured app!"

1590,Neil Roeth,"March 25, 2017",5," This has everything I want in a reminder/task app. You can create multiple lists then enter a task with a priority, a due date, etc., or with none of those attributes so you just don't forget it completely. Nice interface, smart lists, and notifications by email, too."
1591,Sean Digital Fix,"April 7, 2017",2," Can't sort completed items. Useless for shopping lists, or any list where you frequently reuse items. Sorting must be really difficult for the devs: it's been a feature request for *years* now."

1596,Michael Handler,"March 19, 2017",5," This is the best todo app I've ever used. It's performant on the web and my Samsung S6, its UI is consistent, it syncs reliably, andit's highly customizable."

It seems really well thought through. However, practically everything is only available in pro version. Even notifications! I don't mind paying for apps, but this one is steep at at $40 every year. The developers could have been a bit more generous with the free version, I am far more likely to buy an app that I think is great as a free version.

I feel I really should like rtm a lot more than i do. All the features are there, and the web version has heaps better keyboard shortcuts than something like Todoist. But whether it's fonts or some finer point in UX I can't put my finger on, rtm never grabs me to use long term. Some of it is lack of integration capability (cf Trello, Toodledo, Todoist) and the feeling of being locked in. This app is good though."
1683,Danielle B,"December 26, 2016",5,"Amazing useful This app is really useful in not only reminding me to do things, but also to identify goals and achieve them. So many of my goals go by the wayside because I forget about them, until now. Love, love, LOVE this app."
1684,Lisa Butler,"February 8, 2017",5," I tried all the major To Do apps at the same time, and RTM was the best fit. The user interface is far superior to the others as well as the recurring event entry process. It also just *looks* better, which means I'm actually using it."

It is a fabulous app except for one thing - the Android version of the app doesn't offer multiple snooze or postpone options when you get a notification. The only option within the Android version is to postpone the task for 24 hrs. You can't postpone it for say, 1 hour, or 3 hours, or 30 minutes. If you want to do that, you have to go into the app, open up that task, and change the date and/or time of the task, which is pretty inefficient for an app that otherwise saves me time. Today, 12/16/2016, I sent a suggestion to customer service that they said they'll forwarded to the RTM developer team. I hope the RTM developers will add expanded choices for snooze/postpone soon. If they don't, I'll need to switch to another to do app, which would make me very sad. Crossing my fingers!"
1698,Charlotte Jane Grimaldi Phillips,"January 23, 2017",5,"Great to do list app Really easy to use. You can add categories, start, end dates and complete to each task. A handy app."
1699,Philipp Bunge,"January 24, 2017",5," Really powerful and lovingly created task manager. Having some knowledge of how to best implement your personal workflows (e.g. through a book like Getting Things Done) is helpful to set up your right smart lists, etc. and get the most out of the app."
1700,A Google user,"January 1, 2017",5,Great app! For people that care about managing their tasks and times.  Without it life would be much harder for all the self management I need to do.

If you've ever wanted a digital to do list, do your self a favor and download this app.  It will keep you organized and on top of your busy life.

I am giving this rating on the free version however --- it is a perfect fit for my life."

1710,Clara K. Biesel,"January 27, 2017",5," It is especially great for couples doing grocery shopping. I can check on my way home if there's anything on the list. Or if I am out but think, bananas would be nice, I don't need to wait till I am home to write it on the pad on the fridge. So nice. :)"
1711,Anna Lam,"February 1, 2017",5," Love this app! It's easy to use and has many different features. I like how many different ways you can view your tasys (by day, week, list, etc) and that everything transfers smoothly from mobile to desktop and vice versa. Very helpful, simple, and intuitive."
1712,A Google user,"December 25, 2016",5,"Awesome features Its so easy to add tasks! The complimentary webapp helps managing tasks in bulk. Smart lists, location based tasks are among the best features. Features like reminders and subtasks are not available for free use. Anyway, very useful app!"
1713,A Google user,"March 25, 2017",5, Easy to pick up and use  I tend to forget the app and then when I get really busy go back and get caught up and start adding and categorizing things  I didn't like the cloud concept but really appreciate the access from any device
1714,Stuart Pyne,"December 24, 2016",5,"Keeps me in check The best ""to do list"" app I've come across; repeat chores and one-off reminders, and location specific tasks..the free version gives me all the functionality I need! Definitely recommend!"

1725,J. D.,"December 27, 2016",3, Meh It's OK. It has all the features down but compared to apps like Todoist the setup feels 1/2 baked and not very elegant compared to others like it.
1726,Martin Harris,"December 29, 2016",5,Best list app for GTD RTM is the best list app you will find on android. Quick to use with the firepower and advanced features if you need them. It's backed by an excellent web service. Love it.
1727,Hannah Watson,"January 20, 2017",4," Good reminder app. It sometimes tries to be a bit too clever: typing in 'prepare lessons for Friday', for instance, will make it set the task for Friday, which isn't necessarily what you mean."

It doesn't force a complicated scheme for organizing tasks and due dates upon you. Nor does it prevent you from getting as nerdy as you want with your scheme. It works as a simple mind-dump bucket, or as a tagged, listed, filtered-sort GTD machine.  Even more accommodating: there are apps for every platform you can think of, and an API that lets all kinds of outside apps hook in and give you access to your tasks. You can add tasks via email, so that means tools like IFTTT have a way of connecting RTM to all your other apps.

I've been searching for the holy grail of features in a checklist app for years. I've bounced around from app to app every six months or so, and I know it sounds ridiculous but when I was using a particularly ineffective one my quality of life was affected. RTM is my holy grail.

Over time the number of functionalities increased (as well as the website loading time), and the tool lost its charm for me.

The new app hits all the important points spot on and does so with an attractive and intuitive interface.  Performance and sync reliability is outstanding.    For several years I have been bouncing between the old RTM, Wunderlist, Todoist, and Toodledo, always having to live with some deficiencies and always being distracted by them. Now I can stop searching for the perfect app, because I found it, and focus on getting things done. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!  In case you're into the details, here are some of the things I LOVE about the new apps (Android & Web):  Has priorities, subtasks, tags, due dates, notes, start dates, timed or location reminders, repeating tasks, assignment to others When you sort a list by Due Date, it sorts secondarily on Priority Left column display of lists, time periods, contacts, tags, and locations with their respective counts. Settings like sort method and color of tags is synchronized between Android and web.  Subtasks can have their own due dates, priorities, and tags. Awesome Widgets Date pickers use a calendar interface I have more, but I'm out of space!"

The fact that that Remember the Milk syncs between my desktop and my Android device means I always have my task list with me, both for doing and for remembering something I need to do when away from my desktop.  This is one of my first apps to install on a new device."

2377,Rory McClelland,"May 2, 2016",5,"Better than web interface Strongly recommended. To make it even better, work out how to maintain the relationship between the task and the inspiration for the task, for example an email."
2378,A Google user,"March 26, 2016",5,Great app! Use it almost daily. Keeps me from forgetting stuff I need to get or do.
2379,Beth Kemp,"April 12, 2016",5,I love Remember the Milk! I'd get so little done without this. So easy to keep tasks repeating at pretty much any interval. Using different lists and priorities makes this really flexible and useful.

2385,Vilhelm Lundqvist,"April 21, 2016",4," Great app that's easy to learn, especially with smart lists and the search query engine. Only major feature I find I'm missing is the concept of sequential and parallell tasks/task dependencies."
2386,Scrooge52,"May 3, 2016",5,Great App! Very simple to use. I use it mostly for a daily to-do list and specific shopping lists for various stores. It's nice to just un-check the repeat items instead of typing them in every time.

And here RTM was created by an Australian developer. Serendipity!
2546,David Hayes,"March 19, 2016",5,Near perfect now! I use RTM daily. Pro is essential if use more than just your Android (Pro enables instant sync). The only thing missing is a tie in with Google Voice.

2549,Dave Liao,"March 17, 2016",5,Fantastic The power if RTM is in its filters - if you tag your tasks the right way you'll always know what you should - and can - handle at any moment in time. Their latest app can handle whatever you throw at it - give them a try!
2550,Rachel Russak,"March 24, 2016",5," This version is easy to use on mobile. Great for organizing between my husband and I since we can share lists. We use it for to do lists as well as lists of things to purchase- groceries, household items, etc."
2551,Alex Makhlin,"March 15, 2016",5,Three years plus and still my app of choice. I've been using this app so long I've lost count. I use it in combination with the GTD method for phenomenal results. The newest updates have kicked things into overdrive.
2552,Gunel Sebzeliyeva,"March 5, 2016",3," When I installed it I could see my completed list, but now i can't see :( so confused.. because it motivated me when I saw my completed list."
2553,Daniel Wilson,"March 18, 2016",3,"More steps than previously The latest version makes me select a task/list, then select the menu, then hit ""edit"". I liked it better when I could edit right when I selected the task."
2554,Tiago Macambira,"March 20, 2016",5,"Tasks: flexible, powerful and simple I just love how to the point it can be. Besides, the ability to classify with tags, separate on lists and ""smart lists"" and its ""quick add"" (syntax) features make this as flexible and powerful as it can be without being too overwhelming or overly complicated to use."
2555,A Google user,"March 14, 2016",5,Great app. Wish more pay options Love the app. Wish there was something between free and $25 per year. I'd love to pay something. Would also lone to have widgets but not enough to pay $25/year.
2556,Michael Baranowski,"March 7, 2016",5,"I always come back to RTM I'm easily enticed by shiny new apps, but I  always stick with Remember The Milk in the end because nothing is quicker and more efficient for me.  Totally worth getting a Pro subscription."

2560,A Google user,"April 2, 2016",5,Love the new UI on the phone RTM is a very powerful productivity app. Like the new UI on the phone but not a big fan on the tablet. It feels a bit flippy floppy on the tablet.

2564,A Google user,"March 19, 2016",5,Best timed Todo list I've found UI on Android is excellent. This combined with the cloud interface via browser makes it invaluable to me. I use for professional and personal appointments.  More useful than the other organizers with serious names :-)

2629,A Google user,"March 1, 2016",5,Ravi I have tried so many GTD apps but at last I started loving this app. But it is pricy. Very good for repetitive tasks and I liked search option. I kept on trying other similar apps but always returned back to this excellent app.

I think this is update has made RTM the best task application for android.  My biggest concern has to do with readability. The font size can't be controlled from the application. On the plus side, I do not need to add the task of going to the eye doctor because every task reminds me I need glasses.   It has complete batch editing of tasks, follows good android rules, and has most of the bells and whistles for GTD. RTM is a fun app and I am enjoying it a great deal."
2636,Ben Fulton,"March 5, 2016",5,The best A hobby of mine is to compare many available apps when I'm looking for app of any given type. I can say that this is by far my favorite task managing app for casual users. Swiping right to mark an item as complete or left to postpone are very satisfying actions.

I will be searching for a new app to use.  Since the update I had to delete items that showed up from June of 2015!  Several thousand.  Now certain tasks are showing up for the day repeated 10+ times. Occasionally a random task from months ago will show up in my incomplete list.  Even though I have edited the master task list.  I just 'completed' a list of tasks from yesterday, only to go back in the app and those tasks are back on my uncompleted list for today.  Beyond aggravating.  I really hope I can find a new app that is comparable to the ""Remember the Milk' I was using last week before this worthless update.  If you are looking for an app - this is NOT the one."

The swipe action also used to be a very common action for those of us who have used the app for years and used to do something useful.  The few added features do not make up for this terrible design decision and merely make the once elegant app overly cluttered. Long time paying user, but not renewing.  My prior review follows for comparison: Literally everything you could ever want in a to do list app. Allows sorting by date, location, importance,  etc. Add tags to subdivide types of tasks (eg home, work, shopping...whatever you wish). Automatically syncs to all devices and online so you have your list no matter where you are. Widget available so can even have your list on your home screen. This is a truly impressive app!"

To-dos are inherently objects to manipulate, and the shortcuts for task entry are well-designed and easy to remember.

One of the features I love most is the ability to enter task due dates more quickly and easily than is possible with some competing popular to-do managers. For example, I can simply type or say, ""return library book in 2 weeks,"" or ""pick up cookies on Friday"" rather than having to click two or three times and then go through several extra steps just to select a due date. However, other options for entry are still available when needed. I also like that it's relatively easy to postpone tasks--that's another feature not available with at least two of the more popular apps I recently checked out. Furthermore, RTM allows for pretty complex repeating task options. If and when location-triggered reminders are available, this app will have pretty much everything I could imagine ever needing."

I've been using this app every day for the past several months. I've tried to work with it, but I keep having issues with repeating tasks. The ones that are set to repeat every 1 week always show up a day early. Additionally, when I first set up a few daily repeating tasks via desktop, they wouldn't repeat. I ended up deleting them all and recreating on my phone, and for some reason they worked then. I contacted the help desk about the daily repeating task issue and they were quick to respond, though they said they'd just send the issue on to developers. Now I'm noticing issues with tasks that are set to repeat every 6 weeks showing up too early as well. Argh! I'm going to look for something with a more reliable repeat feature."

2979,Hans Mansens,"March 9, 2015",2," Where can I find the opportunity to add a time to a task?, lets say, tomorrow at 12?, with a time reminder?, wanted to ask it by email, but on the site it does not get send (?).. Waiting for the answer to see if I must remove it from my phone... Thx!"
2980,Brian Beaudet,"January 18, 2016",5,Perfect tool for me I've tried to integrate RTM into my own personal productivity system at least two different times in the past. Now it's working for me most likely because I can use it on all of the devices I have which I didn't have before. I'm glad I didn't give up.
2981,Philip Campbell,"January 5, 2015",5,"Best I've used For task management, this is the app that best fits my needs. I pay for the Pro subscription because it is worth it! Nice mobile/Chrome/desktop (web) integration, plenty of options (eg, associated URL), and more great options on the way."
2982,Amanda Cox,"March 19, 2015",4,"Very useful app. This app. has it all for organizing to do lists and for those who suffer with memory problems, great tool for reminders."
2983,Soumyo Chatterjee,"March 20, 2015",2,Outlook sync doesn't works Tried to be a paid member to have the sync with outlook but it never works. Need to uninstall and re-install every time to make it work which is pathetic
2984,Peter Donnelly,"June 21, 2015",5,get I've used it every day for maybe three years.  Transformed my life.  I get so much more done now.  EDIT: OH DEAR.  IT HASN'T BEEN SYNCING FOR SIX WEEKS.  WHAT'S GOING ON RTM DEVELOPERS?
2985,Shelly Hilton,"December 7, 2014",5,Great What a great app. You can tick items off your list when purchased and they disappear. Easy to use too
2986,Victoria Fernandez Salom,"January 9, 2015",5,"Simple, elegant and does what it has to do A great way to get organised, and I recently went premium for easy sync between laptop and phone - I wish I had done it years ago, so worth it."
2987,Nathan Brooks,"November 10, 2015",5,Remember the Milk Great to do app! Lots of great features and works well with others.
2988,Joby John,"November 6, 2015",4,"App is good but with limitations App is good,  but the limitation is that there is only one free sync in a day,  you have to buy premium for unlimited sync,  with so many other applications that offer unlimited sync for free,  this is a serious limitation"
2989,Justin McCullough,"August 9, 2015",5,"Create RtM review due Today - Complete Remember the Milk may be the greatest manager I've ever used. With its text shortcuts, it's easy to set up due dates, add to lists, and tag items in my list."
2990,Carol Taylor,"May 25, 2015",1,Requires an account before letting you check out the features.  Deal breaker!  I have no idea what this app is like because they won't let me preview any features.  BYE!!
2991,C James,"June 8, 2015",4,Get things done! Cool little app for saving time and prioritizing but you can only update once a day
2992,Clint Konzman,"August 30, 2015",5,"Can't live without it This app is so much more functional than just remembering daily tasks.  It's become my complete planning system for my life and business,  well worth the annual upgrade cost."
2993,Leading Geek,"December 28, 2014",5,Beautifully designed The only thing that comes close to Things on Android.
2994,Erik arredondo,"March 4, 2015",4,"Very complete It has all the standard options plus ease of use. I haven't fully explored it that's why it's 4stars, but it could very well turn into 5 in the next week or so."
2995,John Doe,"January 23, 2015",1,"Remember the Milk is SOUR Another crapware app that demands that u use the cloud in order 2 make a private 2 do list 4 ur self on this planet. I do not liv n ""the cloud. Rating: -5."""
2996,Louise Corcoran,"January 17, 2015",5,"Love it Very handy app, it keeps me on track of what I need to do. If tasks aren't completed on the day you've set the reminder is still there so you don't forget. No technical problems, I'm using the Xperia Z2"
2997,Rachael Conners,"May 24, 2015",4,Use it daily Use this handy little app to remind me of projects to do over the week. I wish putting in details like when in the title line were easier or that making the notes didn't cut off at three lines
2998,A Google user,"January 3, 2015",4,"Easy, reliable It is easy to use. Does everything I want on pro. Just too expensive for an app. though!"
2999,Dawn Van Skiver,"August 12, 2015",4,Great little app Wish the free app would sinc with my calendar then it would be 5 stars.  There is an opportunity to purchase a yearly pro membership for $25 a year but I'd rather pay a one time fee.
3000,Brandon H,"February 16, 2015",5,"Just keeps getting better! I use this all day every day. Love the widget to quickly add a task, I keep that on my home screen to add things that pop into my head."
3001,Ika Puspa,"December 8, 2014",3," I give 5 stars for the apps however I need to sync this list with my BB and Note3, I wish I could purchase it from provider (such as Telkomsel, XL, Indosat), using Credit Card is too risky."
3002,Sheena Sutherson,"November 13, 2015",5,Can't do without it! I've got so many projects running & this is just amazing in terms of being a constant reminder & I love that I can categorize my stuff.. hope the subtasks soon become a permanent feature! 😊
3003,Clint Talbert,"February 26, 2015",5,It is great if you subscribe The free version does not sync as often as I need-maybe that works for some people. But I subscribed and have used it for two years now. It works beautifully. Well worth the money.
3004,Ilmo van der Löwe,"August 6, 2015",5,"More under the hood The app works great as it is, but it's real power comes from how well it plays with other systems (e.g., via email). However, this is best set up using the desktop interface, not the app itself."
3005,A Google user,"December 19, 2014",4,"Using with Agenda Watchface for Pebble Great to have my to do list on my Pebble. An excellent task manager.  Would be nice if the mobile app was a little 'friendlier', eg, swipe to complete a task, easier to input dates, geolocate tasks etc."
3006,Vishal Gupta,"May 9, 2015",4, It's nice app. Didn't give 5 stars due to sync delay which is introduced in free version
3007,shenne hahn,"December 29, 2014",4,"Useful Just started using this app a few months ago, and rely on it daily to keep track of multiple to-do lists and calendars. Would like to expand functionality by figuring out Evernote interaction next."
3008,Gary Ellenbogen,"March 31, 2015",1,Their customer service & tech support is HORRIBLE!! NO phone support even for paying customers.  And frequently they ignore emails asking for tech/customer support
3009,Bonita Smith,"January 19, 2015",4,"Great so far! I'm still playing around with this app, but once I get it set the way I want it I believe it will be very useful! I'm using it for home management. I also love that I can sync it between my desktop, kindle & Android."
3010,Jack Turner,"April 18, 2015",5,Best task manager I've found. This is by far the best & most fully featured task manager / to do lister I've come across & I've tried a lot. You can keep it simple or go into incredible detail if you need to.
3011,Felix Owusu,"February 1, 2016",5,"Good app, wish it had better widget Great app for a great service. I may wish it was easier to show different lists on the widget (i.e. Switch to shopping list while shopping without going into options)"
3012,Mike Hayes,"June 6, 2015",5,"The best task manager! Full featured, simple to use, syncs across all platforms, available offline, great apps and Web platform, easy to customize and update. I use it every day to manage tasks and set priotities."
3013,Stéfanos Frangos,"January 14, 2016",5,"Simply Superb What a great App. Let's me do things the way I want to. I Especially like the personalisation that it creates, allowing me to input information and reminders the way I want to."
3014,Patricia Gabriel,"April 20, 2015",5,Keeps me sane! I use to make paper lists but this works so much better. I am able to postpone tasks and they eventually get done because I don't lose that paper list
3015,Giuseppe De Maso Gentile,"January 14, 2015",4,A good GTD classic Perfect for light/medium activity. But needs some cosmetic and functional update versus more recent software. 1 day only sync is still acceptable in free version.
3016,Lindy Bolzern,"June 21, 2015",5,"Ellarbee Pro's worth every penny and I've only had it a week, it's got all the features you wish Free had. It was a great app for free, now it's perfect. Thanks!"
3017,Ken Millard,"May 12, 2015",1,Won't  authenticate Can't set up for the first time.  Just stalls out when I try to log in.  Tried several times.  Uninstalling.
3018,Eddie Borrero,"August 11, 2015",4,"Moooo! Good App but...It would be great if a highlight/check-off features are integrated into this App. With that, it would make this App awesome. That's the only reason I rated 🌟🌟🌟🌟s. Great job guys."
3019,Brian McGuirk,"September 24, 2015",5,Most useful app This is the app that I use every day. The only thing I use more is email.
3020,Wayne Hyde,"November 26, 2015",5,Best money spent Looked through several apps over months trying to find a task app that fit all my needs for a good price. This is that app. Enough customization with plenty of features. Perfect for multi users and fits all my needs.
3021,Lonnie Lee,"January 6, 2015",5,Very Useful App Excellent way to stay organized for the new year.  Love the ability to create tabs for lists. Use on desktop too but wish I could sync across all my devices.
3022,Lizzie Robinson,"January 15, 2015",4,I love lists Using the free version of the app and love it. At last I can keep up to date with my lists of things to do. Will be updating to the pro version soon

3035,Peter DeGoede,"February 10, 2015",4,Love RTM app pretty good. A little hard to navigate. I would love a one touch way to mark complete such as swiping
3036,JP Cabrales,"December 18, 2014",5,"Not just milk! I don't have to forget anything. Very easy to use and has the features I need. There are promising task list apps that have appeared (they even have free features that's premium with RTM), but this is still the best task list app... For now."
3037,Neha Chawla,"May 3, 2015",4,Great app... Easy way to remember things that need to be done at a later point of time. Love the fact that has different classes for Personal n work...
3038,David Robin,"February 15, 2015",5,"Best To-App I have tried many, but this one still stays my favourite ! I wish it also had a nested list feature, but it's really great anyway"
3039,Sunita Jennings,"March 9, 2015",3, I like the site but the app isn't that compelling. I end up using the site on my phone more than the app.
3040,A Google user,"March 6, 2016",5,"One of my favorites! This app is the first I download with a new phone. Absolutely indispensable for my husband and I; we constantly use it to updates lists for around the house, work, and groceries."

3043,Yasmin Pitter,"May 1, 2015",4,"RTM Simple, easy to use andand effective. Love the task bar at the side of my Gmail inbox, so I can constantly see what tasks I need to complete whilst working."
3044,Tim Kelly,"December 10, 2015",4," Only feature missing is better prioritization. Would be nice to easily list things as 1, 2, 3, etc. without having to put the numbers in the task title."
3045,Dana Zohri,"February 14, 2015",4,Good But I have a suggestion. This is a very good app and helps people to do things on time. I really liked it. But I have 1 suggestion. Its to remind.  I mean send a notification to do the task. But this app is already good.
3046,Chateen Krueger,"January 5, 2015",5,"Great app Using the paid version. Excellent synchronization among all users and devices. Can't leave home without my phone, especially because I need this app!"
3047,Walter Masnyk,"January 30, 2016",5,It's a very practical tool! I've used it now for several years. Helps me keep track of too many things to do....across all my device.
3048,David Thomas,"June 2, 2015",3,Great! Good reliable stable and dependable. Although when is sub tasks going to be added? Once you start using in web app you can't really go back to the droid app.
3049,A Google user,"December 25, 2014",5,Outlook Tasks Syncd The best solution to sync outlook tasks with Android. The widget is like a ToDo reminder on your home screen helping you manage your day to day and upcoming events
3050,Steve D,"December 30, 2014",5,Outstanding! Sync's on all my devices. Easy to use. I like the ability for multiple tags on a task.
3051,Kev O'Neill,"February 2, 2016",5,Does the job... Only limitations found are due to mobile format or me using the free versions
3052,Allison Edrington,"April 24, 2015",5, There are a few browser based options i wish were included in the mobile version to make task creation smoother. But it's still an excellent app and they are frequently improving it's performance.
3053,Sean Dent,"April 2, 2015",2,No notifications? And a lot more difficult to upgrade than most playstore apps
3054,Jacky Tustain,"December 18, 2014",5,"Great little app. Great little app, really easy to use and useful. Just have to remember to use it. ;)"
3055,Jigar Patel,"February 14, 2015",4,Good but can be simplified The default interface can be simplified so as to not enter many details and the current one can be made optional for power users
3056,Cynthia Seyler,"September 24, 2015",5,"Convenient It's handy to have all your lists & reminders in one place - and that place is in your pocket. I've used RtM for at least 5 years, and for something free it's outstanding."
3057,Yichao Yu,"February 18, 2015",1,Buggy 1. The widgets can only be added after reboot 2. Stop syncing and widgets stop working every week (reinstall solves the issue)
3058,Lyra Su,"April 11, 2015",5,"good app I normally don't rate apps, but this app is really to get my life organized. Thank you so much for the invention."

3063,Frank Ballard,"August 9, 2015",5,Continues to out rival otherd I stopped experimenting with other software like this because it is so much better and completely solves all of my list preparation and lists sharing problems
3064,Rick Seenarine,"January 9, 2015",3,It's OK The application is OK and let's you get what you need done... eventually.  The application isn't well built like others which have a better focus on experience and getting things done.  The UI is due for an update also.   Overall it is worth the download if you are an RTM customer.
3065,Vincent Lowe,"June 14, 2015",5,"Helpful Everywhere ...this app helps me on my phone, on my iPad, and on any web browser. I can always keep track of what I need to do or buy. Definitely worth subscription."

3070,Antariksha Pattnaik,"August 2, 2015",4,"Great app for preparing schedule A good app on overall basis. Had there been provision to set time for each task, it would have been a perfect Task planner app."
3071,Kris Rowan,"April 9, 2015",5,"Finally found the app for me! Like most people,  I'm very dependent on my task lists.  RTM is by far the best for me and this app is the most effective and user friendly."
3072,A Google user,"May 5, 2015",5," Best to-do app ever! Very happy to pay. I can capture any task in any context, and process online from my laptop if I want."

I tried Google Keep for a while, and came back to RTM!   RTM is the best task manager ever, with great support for mobile. I love how it can SMS text me when I need it to for a reminder - I don't pay much attention to Android or Apple notifications - but I do respond to texts so that is a killer feature no other tasks manager has.

3601,Ty Walls,"November 10, 2014",5,Great app! Definitely the best and most complete and production-oriented of all of the todo list apps I've tried. Google Keep is overly simplistic. Wunderlist is too slow and expensive. Any.do is goofy. Syncing has been seamless. Well worth the annual fee.
3602,A Google user,"November 28, 2014",4,"Still almost perfect Works very well. Only minor things are missing.

Main problem I have is that you need pro to sync online list to mobile more than once every 24 hrs. I believe the lack of alignment to be the cause of emails about tasks of the day I've already completed, changed to be due weeks or months later, etc. Probably has to do with having to edit the due date of a task after creating it online.The buttons/menus when making a new task are a tad confusing but I should get used to them; right now it's all guess and check."

However the Android app will only sync once every 24 hours. I wouldn't mind this if it wasn't my only reason to go premium.

If you're looking for task manager, you won't find a better one"

I have downloaded and tried about 4 other of the most popular task/ to-do apps and this comes closest to what I want.  I love how straightforward everything is.

4342,A Google user,"May 12, 2014",5,"So simple yet unique. Normally I'm all Google apps just because everything works together pretty well. Everything except task management. Remember the Milk pretty much did everything right. Intuitive, uncluttered and just works. I can't ask for more."
4343,David Gregory,"June 7, 2014",5,Excellent For a free app easy to use and organise. Shame you can only sync once a day but fair enough for free
4344,Trevor Thomas,"May 22, 2014",4,"Simple but Detailed This app is perfect! It's simple and intuitive,  but still detailed and advanced. A must have! Expensive however!"
4345,A Google user,"March 18, 2014",3,"Good app but I'm still leaving No custom reminders per task. I have decided to switch to Todoist... its interface requires less clicks to get things done and feels more intuitive to me, and it supports per-task reminders"
4346,Rob Knowlan,"October 21, 2013",5,"Brilliant tool for the highly distracted Having a reminder is one thing, having a configurable reminder service is a godsend.  I love this tool and I imagine you will too."
4347,Lynne Grow,"December 21, 2013",5,"The more I use it, the more I find myself loving it! I really like breaking the tasks into separate doors and then making lists. No more paper  notes to lose!"
4348,Jay Cairns,"January 10, 2014",5,RTM pro + Evernote = tough to beat Worth the money to get pro version. These folks put some time into getting this system right. Take (not much)  time to learn it and you'll be organized for the long haul.
4349,Andrew Postma,"February 21, 2014",5,Love this app. Have used the paid version for at least 2 years and started using it because it was one of the few to-dos that was on all platforms. I've tried others but I always come back because I like being able to easily access it on my desktop and phone. Highly recommended.
4350,A Google user,"November 18, 2013",5,"Great app! I really enjoy using this app, it really helps me stay on top of things.  Lots of great features."
4351,Bill Carlton,"September 28, 2013",5,"Great app for keeping up with your tasks. If your have reoccurring tasks that have a unique repeating schedule, then this app is for you. It also has an app for most OS's or browsers."
4352,LaRhesa Johnson,"April 27, 2014",3,Not Useful I like the website but the app is useless if you don't have pro due to the lack in syncing.
4353,Arash Sayadi,"October 3, 2013",5,Love it I've been using the app for two years and love it.  I especially love the ability to share tasks.  I use the app on my desktop and check the tasks off or add new ones on my Android tablets and phone.  They all work great.
4354,Matt Waller,"December 6, 2013",5,Great App RTM keeps me organized and focused on my tasks. The app is easy to use and reliable. I highly recommend it.
4355,Monica Chattman,"January 3, 2014",4,Help for a moron I am very unorganized and if I don't use this app....I forget it.  It was cheaper than therapy or a divorce attorney!!!  Woo hoo!
4356,Andre Williams,"December 12, 2013",4,"Useful in many ways. This app helps me remember author whose books I have in mind. I enjoy adding quotes from favorite movies, historians and humanitarians. Nice app, a little difficult to navigate but good."

Areas for improvement: would be great to get notifications through to phone rather than email when tasks are due; would be great if there was a grid view for the week, with start and end times for tasks."
4358,Michael Garrison,"February 18, 2014",2,Too expensive for basic features I cant see my tasks in the app on my phone tonight because I clicked manual sync on the wrong device first. The pro version is way too expensive.
4359,Vanessa Lake,"February 3, 2014",5,Brilliant! I have used RTM for several years now and love it even more on my Nexus 7. The Evernote integration has just made it even better.
4360,Rosie Leithhead,"November 10, 2013",4,"Pretty handy tool, fairly easy to use Good tool.  A little more friendly  interface on the browser and improved HTC app would be good.

4361,Beth Cordi,"April 4, 2014",5,Great  app! This is just the app I needed for all my to-do lists.  Couldn't be happier with it.  Thanks!
4362,Rex Birkinbine,"September 27, 2013",5,Very useful app. I find myself using it more and more because it does keep me from forgetting important and not so important things.
4363,Moises Saldana,"October 5, 2013",3,Works well but a few more features and it will be amazing A reminder in the notifications would be nice for important things. A way to set up goals and mini goals like action method and track progress would be amazing. Putting together this action method and google keep would be the ultimate app.
4364,William Graham,"September 22, 2013",5,"Excellent tool for ""Get Things Done"" great tool for tagging and prioritizing. you can use it to easily sort and search your to do list. it is easy to add and edit lists on the fly. interface is fast and intuitive. integrates reasonably well with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar."

4367,Miyuki Andvik,"October 6, 2013",5,"Love it! The only problem is, now I can't forget things...  It works great on my old android, and love how it's so easy to add tasks."
4368,Devin Solkov,"January 29, 2014",5,"Excellent task managing system Remember the Milk is by far my favorite task management application, due its ease of use on both the hand held, and desktop comuter. It  advantageously takes melds both formats to allow for seemless management of day to day activities, which can be organized by relevance and categorized by type."
4369,Manoj Kumar,"September 21, 2013",5,"Great ui This app has the best UI among all the to do list managers I tried. It's very simple, non cluttered and things are at the right place."
4370,A Google user,"March 4, 2014",4,"Useful, but needs UI work I still use RTM because it is the only service I've found that meets my needs, but the UI could still use a lot of improvement. Specific to the android app, it could greatly benefit from following the Google-recommended design standards so the experience is more lightweight and consistent."
4371,Teropher,"September 15, 2013",1,"Subscription & permissions $25 for only a 1 yr for a reminder list?! Are you out of your ever loving mind? And why does a to-do/reminder list need to know your location or what the name of your WiFi connection is? Thx, but no thx!"
4372,A Google user,"February 13, 2014",3,"Ok But keeps duplicating tasks on my list. It also won't remove completed tasks when I sync across devices. On the plus side, the only android and iOS program I found and they have a website which makes building and maintaining lists easier"
4373,William Barnum,"December 15, 2013",4,"I run my life with this thing I concur with many others here who say the paid app is great, and the free one is OK too.  I now run my life with this thing, and recommend it."
4374,Stephanie Bolton,"December 9, 2013",5,Indispensable! Very helpful app for people who are juggling lots of roles. Is helped me to remember many of the weekly things that I usually forget.
4375,Rob Weeks,"September 24, 2013",5,"Absolutly brilliant I'd be lost without remember the milk! Fantastic app.   One feature I'd like to see is to be able to set ""working days"" on a list, so if I postpone a task on Friday, it moves over to Monday."
4376,Harm Bakker,"September 22, 2013",3,"Could be better Too many clicks needed for the most basic actions.. Devs: Please think about usability. We want an app that saves time ;)    Apart from it it developed well over time, love the widgets."

4378,Andreas Sauerwein,"February 21, 2014",5,"Excellent todo list This todo-list is one of the best apps in store! One advantage is the compatibility to a great number of platforms e.g. iOS, ANDROID and even Blackberry! The widgets for hi-resolution Android tablets could be larger... nevertheles: 5 stars"
4379,Linda Davis,"April 22, 2014",5," Great app.  It really comes in handy not only for a to do list,  but is excellent for staying on top of my groceries now and in the future.   Thank you."
4380,A Google user,"October 16, 2013",3,"Pop-up Really Stinks! I like the app, but the pop-up demanding that I rate the stupid thing really makes it difficult, especially when I can't do anything else on it until I make nice."
4381,Japhy Grant,"September 24, 2013",5,Worth the price The most flexible and intuitive GTD system I know of. It adapts to your style instead of forcing you to follow its.
4382,Jason Forté,"February 24, 2014",5,Great App Great flow between different views. Could do with some work on the location feature - can't pick a precise location.

4385,Stephen Colby,"January 14, 2014",4,"Easy to use Over two years of use I have found RTM works well in the continual accumulation, sorting, scheduling and editing of tasks. The cloud storage saved me when phones quit or got replaced."

4387,David Garner,"September 27, 2013",4,Great app for task list org I use it all the time and honestly don't know how it remembered half of what I need to beforehand. APP is better than Web interface in several ways but both work well together.

4389,A Google user,"October 27, 2013",5,"Works offline and portable across devices RTM runs on Android, iOS, the PC and best of all works offline so I can update my task list on the subway and sync once I have connectivity again. Not sure what I'd do without it."
4390,Zoe Hurtado,"June 2, 2014",4,"Very useful Love this app, use it every day to keep track. Sometimes it does mess up on the repeats, but apart from that it's easy to use & reliable."
4391,Dannon Raith,"October 25, 2013",4,Way of life. This is one of my most important apps. Nothing beats the web interface but its good to be able to have all my lists with on the go.
4392,Avi Cohen,"January 6, 2014",2,"Not useful for biz users Can only sync with one outlook instance so if you have multiple PCs syncing with your exchange server account, this app is not for you.  Also the way it syncs seems like this feature was an after thought.   Otherwise,  this is an okay todo app."
4393,Jeff Stone,"March 16, 2014",5,"Use it every day There are enhancements I'd like to see for the overall service on the web, but the mobile client is very good (only limited by the same things that are limitations in the web version)."
4394,Ellie Vigil,"September 24, 2013",5,"Great product I have the Pro account which I love. I can add tasks from my computer at home, work, or mobile devices and access it anywhere else. I don't have to wait until I have access to the right device and then forget what I needed to enter. The email reminders are very helpful too."
4395,Teal Buchi,"November 13, 2013",1,"Too much for Pro version I'd be okay with paying $4.99 for Pro version of this app. Heck I'd even pay $9.99. But $25 for one year or $48 for the next two years? Heck no. I'll look elsewhere for a different great task manager list app now, thank you."
4396,David Hollister,"March 19, 2014",5,Best to-do list service Remember The Milk is the best to-do list service I've found.  And this app is indispensable for letting me keep track of my lists -- the launcher widget and notifications mean I can't forget about a task that's due.
4397,Eddy Aoeu,"December 6, 2013",4,Well designed I've tried this for a couple of days. So far so good. It has a reminder that run under chrome desktop notification which is one of an useful feature that I like. Expecting the capability for recording/entering actual start and finish datetime.
4398,Matt Irons,"November 2, 2013",4,Does the job well Clean interface. Works as if  on desktop browser. Bummer you can only sync once a day but I respect the notion not everything is free.
4399,bill horton,"December 14, 2013",3," It is OK, if you know what day your going to the store (for example), but a ""WHENEVER"" category would be a nice addition for those of us that need reminders under certain conditions."

4403,John Green,"October 26, 2013",5,Get things done The perfect todo list. A flexible solution which you can tailor to your needs. Fits the GTD technique of David Allen as well as others.

4406,A Google user,"February 15, 2014",3,"Good I'm giving this an average rating only because I haven't found that I need to go to it that often. It has a great layout though, nice interface. I don't have anything bad to say about it. If I use it more, then I'll change my rating."
4407,Steve Simpson,"December 17, 2013",1,Tech Support Just Gave Up Do not purchase this app because if you have issues Tech Support will just give up on you
4408,Kidon Chu,"May 2, 2014",4,"Just works This is THE best todo app I have used. It has been more than a year since I started using this and it just works. I didn't give five star becauae the app does not have ""duplicate task"" feature."
4409,Michael Bates,"January 29, 2014",5,"Need the Pro version to make it worth while Great app,  fills the gaps between outlook and your tablet,  phone etc. Different tags for different types of task and emails to remind you."
4410,Jessica George,"December 12, 2013",4,Great Love this ap. Would give it 5 stars if it could sync with my computer more than once a day.  (Or if the paid version want a monthly subscription since that's how you get more syncs)
4411,maserati sembrati,"November 17, 2013",4,"Evernote integration is working for me. Not too much and not too little. The full function on Android is convenient. I try the new apps that are competitive but keep coming back. I am a tweaker, not a twerker, and RTM assumes whatever position I ask it to."
4412,Adam Kaplan,"November 4, 2013",5,"Great to do app The Android experience is perhaps the best reason to upgrade to a premium RTM  account. MilkSync is a seamless experience, and there is almost zero impact if you have low/no data connection."
4413,Bernard Travers,"May 15, 2014",4,"Good for lists, hasn't changed my life It seems pretty good, but not mind-blowing.  Perhaps I need to use it more actively or with more features for it to be amazing, but for now it's a decent tool for remembering deadlines."
4414,Robert Fitzmaurice,"January 5, 2014",4,Concise GTD tool Moved to this from My life organised. Missed the ability to layer tasks at first but soon got to like the comparative simplicity. Filters are the way to go...
4415,Brennan Griffin,"May 12, 2014",4," It is a pretty, well designed, user friendly to do list app. Others provide similar functionality, but I came back to remember the milk because I'm the end I wanted something seamless, simple, and uncluttered."
4416,Alison Stewart,"February 11, 2014",5,"Simple to use, useful Updating via sms / app / actual keyboard on your computer from the website makes Remember the Milk super convenient. Date selection write ins of ""today"" ""tomorrow"" etc also really handy"

4421,Chip Henderson,"September 24, 2013",5,"Just get it already To do and list apps are extremely personal. RTM can be whatever you want it to be. Super complex or super simple, you decide. Or whatever you like in between. And by the way, paying for the Pro upgrade is totally reasonable considering what you get."
4422,Heidi Bjugstad,"January 31, 2014",4,Helps me keep track I love that I can add tasks and take them with me wherever I go. The app is flexible enough for me to add notes and modify how I view my list - by priority or date due. Happy customer!
4423,A Google user,"February 27, 2014",5,Great for GTD A great way to take your GTD system with you.  Even easier to use than the web site and easier to swipe through than most apps I've used.  Well worth the price with side benefit of supporting a great web site.
4424,Christopher Bruzzi,"January 23, 2014",5,Simply the best I've tried many task management apps and Remember The Milk is hands down the best one out there allowing you to manage your tasks easily both on mobile and the web.

4433,A. Caravarin,"May 13, 2014",3," I love the layout and simplicity, but without an alert feature unless you upgrade this still seems like a note taking app rather than a planner. Still, good for a free app though!"
4434,Eli Szus,"January 13, 2014",4,"Good app I've been using the app now for half a year. This is a really good app, but I would love to see a little more active development on the core of the app - like adding check lists, etc."
4435,A Google user,"October 4, 2013",5,Good app for those who lost braincells in the 70's I use the free version and find it a great tool for just about any task I'm doing.  Its easy to use and east to modify any list you make.
4436,Bret Mosley,"January 16, 2014",5,"If i could only add one app to my phone, this would be it. I feel like RTM was made for me. I use it for everything from grocery shopping to song lyrics. Thanks for this killer-est of apps."

4451,Jesse Davis,"March 31, 2014",5, This app has been great when used with a pro account. The syncing works great and having shared lists is so very useful. Would work well without a pro account if used exclusively on a single device.

4460,A Google user,"October 2, 2013",4,More widget types I really could use a this week widget.  I want to see what's coming up without seeing every single task.  Then you get 5 stars
4461,Mohammed Ismail Ansari,"June 5, 2014",5,"Suits me Works for me as the closest replacement to Any.Do, minus the Widgets in free version. Neat interface, fast startup, etc. The only let down is it needs premium account for sync (more than once in 24 hours) and widgets."
4462,SM Wong,"April 30, 2014",2," Good reminder for tracking  of repeating tasks, but limited by no notification of tasks & once a day manual sync, otherwise this should deserve a 5 star app"

5169,A Google user,"July 13, 2013",5,"Powerful,  solid but a tad clunky There are prettier and slicker todo lists out there but RTM just about manages to hang on to me because the synch is solid and it has most of the features I want. Sub-projects and data portability being the main exceptions."
5170,A Google user,"June 20, 2013",4,Long time user I love RTM. I've used it for years. My only complaint is that you can only sync once a day unless you go pro.
5171,Gene Koo,"August 20, 2013",3,"Good, but UI needs tweaking Works well, but checking off done items is strangely cumbersome -- instead of checking a box or swiping, you have to click on the item and then mark done. (Maybe I'm missing something)."
5172,Doug H,"June 10, 2013",4,"Pretty good Best Outlook Task sync app I could find. Often easier to update on the phone even if I'm sitting in front of the pc. Still, could be fewer taps, eg. Add new task + button should go to full edit mode."

5176,Phil Townes,"June 14, 2013",4,Great productivity app Switched to RTM after Astrid announced they'd been acquired by Yahoo. Would be five stars if you could sync mo more than once a day without having to pay $25 a year.
5177,Annette Long,"June 12, 2013",4," I love this app.  Only two things would make it better for me:  being able to link it with Google calendar and being able to list tasks more than a week in advance.  (Remember the Milk may already have these options, but I haven't been able to find them.)"
5178,A Google user,"June 10, 2013",3,"App is good, but why is the site so bad? Seriously, everyone has been demanding the option to check of tasks from the daily overview for years. Why can't you manage this simple change?"
5179,A Google user,"July 10, 2013",1,Free version unusable They locked down the free version so much it's unusable. I paid for the pro version one year...but twenty five bucks for one year of a to-do app is ridiculous

5183,Andre White,"August 11, 2013",4, OK well thought out. Annoying that you have to upgrade to get reminder alerts which is the whole point of this app. Good attempt though.
5184,Artsy Mommas,"July 18, 2013",4,Its growing on me. I do like this app. It is simple and straight forward but some aspects are not super intuitive. I also feel limited with free version but may upgrade since it does function well as a simple to do list.

It was a solid product before but has really come into its own with the new apps, plus the integration with evernote.

5192,John Martinez,"June 23, 2013",3,"Going Downhill Every time they update this app, the user interface gets  ”fancier” and less usable, as if the developer is more interested in showing off his latest Android trick than actually improving usability. Try some free grocery list apps before paying for a subscription to this..."
5193,Kevin Cosgrove,"August 8, 2013",4,"Best Android to-do list I've found with a web interface. I wish reminders could be configured to include late tasks.

Of all the task management apps I have trialed and use over the past few years this one is by far the most diverse with it ability to detail and note track your tasks to meet your needs.

5200,Mark Sharman,"August 2, 2013",5,Great app! I use RTM as a GTD tool and it is without doubt the best tool I've found for the job. The cross platform support and the advanced search functions make it perfect for GTD on the go.

5550,Chuck Greb,"May 24, 2013",3,New style feels less like Android I have been a pro subscriber for 3 years. I am a huge fan of the service but the new interface not so much. It feels less intuitive as an Android user. The Action Bar pattern is broken and the title font is hard to read. Overall the UI/UX just seems more complex without adding value.

As major set back for tablet computing, must go back to laptop. Inexcusable.  Worse/Imbecile is removing long press functionality to perform an edit from view.  Now you must tear off from the row, select edit from task detail.  One extra click.  Two cases where a time saving tool now wastes more time. If this were the 18th century, your Usability Expert would be sent to Australia. Just teasing."
5654,A Google user,"April 28, 2013",1," Was great! And then got the update. Hate it. It worked fine, why did you change it? UX is terrible! Looking for replacement for RTM immediately!"
5655,A Google user,"April 29, 2013",2,New Android app. is a step backwards I dislike the new Android app.  It lost a lot of streamlining.
5656,A Google user,"May 6, 2013",5,"Great! Great program & app.  I resisted due to dumb name & icon, but now use it regularly."
5657,A Google user,"May 1, 2013",5,"Best app ever for productivity Remember the milk have everything one could ask for creating task lists or keeping track of projects, especially if you use their premium services. Definitely a must have for Android."
5658,John Philip,"April 30, 2013",5,Terrific! I don't think existing users are giving the new update a chance. It has the perfect blend of simplicity and just enough information to avoid feature bloat!
5659,A Google user,"April 29, 2013",1,Need update crashescrashes Doesn't work. Please fix
5660,Steve Jones,"April 27, 2013",5,New app is superb. Easy to use with loads of functionality.
5661,Ryan Stull,"June 18, 2013",5,"Awesome Very useful, well with the money, the best feature is the automatic syncing between all of your devices"
5662,Claire Stewart,"April 25, 2013",2,"You ruined it I loved this app, so handy although it had some things to add like sub-tasking. This new update however is ridiculous. It's harder to read in that odd font, I can't rock it as easily which is the whole point of the app. I was a 4 out of 5 before and now it's 2 at best. So disappointed."
5663,A Google user,"May 5, 2013",4,Essential kit Recent changes has caused some head scratching. Getting used to new interface as i've yet to use anything better.
5664,Stuart Midgley,"April 24, 2013",5,Fantastic new update No need to look anywhere else for a top class task manager. RTM gets a long overdue overhaul and nails it on every count. Thank you  RTM!
5665,A Google user,"April 26, 2013",5,"Great App! I was using wunderlist for sometime, but the smart bar and the ease of creating tasks with due dates in RTM is unmatched.  This app gives you that ability in a very clean and intuitive interface.  Great work!"
5666,A Google user,"April 26, 2013",2,Syncing broken Push sync broken in new version. Only reason I went Pro.
5667,Jason Yeager,"April 24, 2013",1,Almost had me.. $25 per year for pro? No. Make it a one time purchase and I'll bite. I'll stay with Notif Pro in the meantime.
5668,Barbara van Wezel,"April 26, 2013",5,Fantastic UI Thanks for adding the side menu - it is much easier to navigate through my tasks now. Great app especially for its sharing functionality!

5670,A Google user,"April 26, 2013",4,Great app but ... IMHO pro version is fairly expensive! I uninstalled in favor of Tasks and free Google Keep.

The desktop widgets are super convenient and the app is speedy.  Some people seem unhappy that these guys want to get paid for their awesome service. $2 a month is crazy cheap for a ubiquitous task manager that CORRECTLY syncs across different platforms and devices and doesn't shovel ads to me.
5678,Matt Galloway,"April 10, 2013",4,"Great features! Scheduling tasks by calendar is makes it really easy to manage, anticipate and reschedule. Syncing through all devices also makes task management more convenient. Once a day syncing is occasionally a worry, but upgrade may not be worth the cost, at least for me."
5679,Shane Poole,"March 28, 2013",4,"Useful I wish you could set a time for the reminders to pop up on your device, several times. Ideally, I'd like it if I could set it  to come up twice a day, but I cannot seem to do this. Other than that, this app is very convenient, if you have purchased the premium version."
5680,A Google user,"April 8, 2013",1,New update is terrible Chews through battery life at alarming rates. Phone can be idle for six hours (left in car while I am at work) and lose 80% just due to this app. Verizon Galaxy S3

Their clarly doing something right!!!"
5682,A Google user,"January 7, 2018",4, It is a great app that I use daily in my work. Only drawback is that the buttons to create or complete a task are small for my big fingers. A button scale option would  make it 5 stars.
5683,Scott Mosher,"April 5, 2013",4,"RTM is an everywhere to-do list The ability for multiple devices/platforms to share the same list(s) means much more flexibility.  Too bad some of the best features require a paying account, but otherwise no complaints!"
5684,Danica Maupoissant,"March 28, 2013",5,So handy I love the ability to create custom lists for each thing on my mind. Really takes a load off trying to remember everything in an increasingly busy and hectic world.

""Remember the Milk"" not only reminds me to keep the frig stocked, it continually saves me from certain death, a la suffocation by Post-It piles. Keeping the fridge stocked is no small task, either. Those cats drink a lot of milk."
5686,John Campbell,"April 21, 2013",1,Great idea Looks Fred but charges to sync. Too expensive.
5687,David Inglis,"April 3, 2013",3,"Useful app The app is excellent, although I am a little disappointed at only being able to sync once a day.   Other than that good job!"
5688,Amron Harper,"April 1, 2013",5,"Works great! I think better integration with google calendars would make it that much better. Like, it would be great if you could include time of day that the task will be or should be done. Or, if you could see the actual tasks due through google calendar. But, it's still a 5 stars as it is."
5689,A Google user,"April 14, 2013",5,Wonderful app I find this app very useful! The ability to e-mail things to do to it is very helpful...  Keep up the great work
5690,Dave Edmunds,"April 19, 2013",4,Great App Couldn't do without it. Free version is fine but for business use the paid for works best.  Still a bit pricey!

5693,Dan Kaplan,"April 4, 2013",5,"Excellent cross platform sync I'm a new user, but I appreciate the availability of my lists in all locations on all platforms. Look forward to future releases and website upgrades."
5694,A Google user,"April 22, 2013",4,"Works well, especially for new tasks entry I use RtM regularly, to organize my individual work. The app is more convenient than the website for recording new tasks--quickly and accurately tagged--during calls and meetings."

Love that timing can be relative (tomorrow) or precise (April 19 @ 3 pm) or even never for items you want to capture but not make a to-do yet.  Would like to support.financially, but not sure I need more than one daily sync (used so far only to mass load lists on web portal via computer keyboard using cut and paste), so going to $2.50/mo seems a stretch so far."
5696,Nicole Nohl,"March 29, 2013",5,Thank you This app is remarkable to keeping me organized and focused. It is so helpful to record activities on my phone and they appear on my computer! I also come from a dairy farming family so the title of this program is fantastic!
5697,A Google user,"April 9, 2013",5,Great app! Easy access to all those RTM features lacking in the Astrid sync. I'm no longer jealous of the iPhone version!
5698,Miriam Thorne,"April 5, 2013",5,"Great little app -wish there was something in between free & $25/year Simple to use, not overloaded with features. Especially like the task cloud. A pulls like to pay something but $25/year is a bit steep..."
5699,Denise Norris,"April 8, 2013",3,"Boo on pro I think there should be at least one widget available on free! I understand wanting money, it's a good app but I won't pay every year. Make it one time and I'm there!"
5700,A Google user,"April 3, 2013",4,Could be free! Makes no sense to pay to use widgets or sync more than one time a day!
5701,A Google user,"April 4, 2013",4,Use It Every Day Good task list program.  I like that it syncs with all my devices.  I wish that you could prioritize tasks both by importance and by the order they need to be accomplished.

There are different time management methodologies including the popular Getting Things Done (GTD) system and the highly effective Franklin-Covey system. Neither of these are implemented directly.

6042,Chris Gilstrap,"January 5, 2013",5,Works great! The title's almost the whole review. I love RTM. My only gripe with the app is that there's a confirmation tap to mark something complete. I'd prefer to just tap and be done.
6043,Christina Holub,"January 26, 2013",5,"Keeps me organized! Simply put- This is the checklist I've been searching for. It's organized just the way I think and works well. The syncing could be improved between devices, but still very much worth it!"

I enter reminders on my Android phone, my iPod Touch, or on the website, and they all get synched together. Synching is fast, and it has always worked flawlessly for me.  I love the tagging feature too. If you use GTD or the Fly Lady system, this app will work with them."
6045,Keri Adams,"January 16, 2013",1,Useless unless you buy pro I want to be able to sync my tasks between desktop and phone.   But to do so you need to upgrade to pro.

6047,Mark White,"February 13, 2013",5,"Very helpful and syncs with Outlook tasks I've tried several organizers with Droid and this is the best.  Easy to use and I recommend the Pro version, which syncs with Outlook tasks.  I haven't seen other organizers that do this."
6048,Andrew McGuire,"February 11, 2013",4,"Bloatware Both the RTM website and App are excellent, and so it's frustrating to see them doing lame money-grabbing moves by including masses of widgets which HAVE NO FUNCTION other than to get you to upgrade your account.  5.28MB for a to-do list is horrid."
6049,A Google user,"September 24, 2012",5,"Easily the best to-do list out there I've experimented for tests with to-do lists, and RTM is the best.  Clean interface, easy to use, but feature-rich too. The free version is probably all you need but the pro is reasonably priced and has a few power features.  Great app and works great with the website."
6050,A Google user,"October 30, 2012",4,"24hr synch is draconian I love the application and supporting website,  but it is difficult to work around the 24hr timer for mobile synch. Even 4-6 hours would be acceptable"

Truly though, RTM is versatile enough that you can implement whatever system best fits your projects and preferences.

6060,Dorian Oddi,"January 26, 2013",5,Best task program by far I have tried almost all the task program including the popular 2do program but none of them match RTM. You can quickly tag you're tasks in a way you can't do with any other program and it allows me to stay super productive
6061,A Google user,"September 18, 2012",4,Creates Efficiency in Life Ok I'm a believer.  The sync capability and multi platform accessibility has made this app critical for daily life organization.  The $25 upkeep fee is high compared to the going rate but I actually think it will be worth it if they keep up the development pace.
6062,A Google user,"September 14, 2012",5,Great for free but There's no way I'm paying for the pro at that cost. Total greed.

6067,A Google user,"October 1, 2012",5,"One of the best Having tried more than my fair share of to-do apps, this one really hits the mark. The PRO version enables synching with Outlook Tasks as well as Google, and the best feature in my opinion is the user-friendly weekly planner that you can print out."

6187,A Google user,"September 22, 2012",3,"What is the point of this app? I just installed it and tried it out but sorry, I just don't get it. Firstly, what can it do that built-in smartphone to-do apps can't do? Secondly, this app is extremely limited in what it can do unless you pay $25 a year for the full service. Not sure how this got rated so highly."

Slight differences in event creation & update between the mobile & desktop versions take a little time to adjust to.

6851,A Google user,"June 9, 2012",5,"Does What I Need Simple and reliable this does just what I need. My tasks get synched to all the platforms and places I want, allowing me to focus on getting them done rather than the tool I use to track them."
6852,A Google user,"June 22, 2012",4," The app, and website for that matter, are both non-intuitive.  It shouldn't take several days for computer-savvy people to figure out the sharing."
6853,A Google user,"August 7, 2012",5,"Excellent org. tool I started new job with lots of tasks to keep track of.  I needed a new system, something better than just a calendar.  RTM is just what i was looking for.  Its easy to use, links with gmail, ipad, smart phone very well.  Its going to be very helpful."
6854,A Google user,"June 15, 2012",4,Good Product Like simplicity for daily to do's.  Best current compromise for my needs. Needs subtask capability. Repeat also needs expiration date.
6855,A Google user,"July 16, 2012",5,Excellent GTD app! This app couldn't be better. So simple...worth every penny of the pro account!
6856,A Google user,"July 14, 2012",5,Great! Great app but i have a problem with the widgets. If i set a widget to a specific list sometimes after a reboot the widget is completely blank.
6857,A Google user,"June 25, 2012",1,"Way too pricey Good app, but at $25( a year) it is massively over priced. Take that to $5 and you would have 10 times the number of pro users"

6883,A Google user,"August 18, 2012",4,Does What I Expect It To Do This app helps me to keep track of my to-dos that I put on Remember the Milk. It does everything I expected it do.
6884,A Google user,"June 15, 2012",5,Best task app I've been using RTM for a while and its definitely worth using... The pro account is worth purchasing if you are serious about managing tasks.
6885,A Google user,"August 17, 2012",1,Useless App is completely useless with only one sync per day.
6886,A Google user,"June 25, 2012",5,"Works for me I use it to remember things I need to do, but also to keep track of medications. I like that it syncs up online."
6887,A Google user,"June 13, 2012",4,"Great apps, but... The apps are well designed and I was willing to pay monthly, but trying to force me onto a yearly subscription is likely to see me going elsewhere."
6888,A Google user,"June 10, 2012",5,"Extremely useful Fantastic app, website is very easy to use, links well with outlook, I LOVE the shortcuts to individual lists (they call them badges)"
6889,A Google user,"June 28, 2012",5," Why pay on market for something thats free on app store, rubbish!"

I can use it to track work throughout the team from my mobile as well as desktop. Really excellent. Would be perfect if the mobile app allowed you to filter view by list and use priorities in the same way as online but I'm splitting hairs. Wouldn't be without it.
7366,A Google user,"February 27, 2012",5,Great App Just the core task mgmt needs. Great to have access on pc and phone. Not pleased that they hide the fact that you have to upgrade to get synching more than a couple of times a day
7367,A Google user,"March 13, 2012",3,"Works Web interface is just okay and not very intuitive. This app seems good but once-a-day sync is very limiting in free version.  Would love sync with Google tasks, too."
7368,A Google user,"January 22, 2012",5,Rtm rules Extremely happy with the mobile version of rtm. Beautiful on the tablet (10.1) and even seems I some ways better than web version.  Doesn't get any better as far as I'm concerned.
7369,A Google user,"January 18, 2012",4,"Effective, but could be better It works well and keeps on sync. The complete button for tasks should be much bigger as it was in previous versions. Also, it would be great if RTM finally added subtasks."
7370,A Google user,"April 26, 2012",5,"Excellent Really well thought through piece of software,  one of the best I encountered. I only wish there was a blackberry version for my hapless blackberry friends. Or maybe be I should just not be friends with them."
7371,A Google user,"January 16, 2012",4,"Don't forget the milk A great app for list makers. Some functions are not real intuitive to use, but for daily lists and reminders it's the best simplest thing I've found.::"
7372,A Google user,"February 2, 2012",4,"Overall - great ... but I miss the two big buttons for complete and postpone from the last version. Too fiddly to do these now, and also to save when editing a task. Pro user though, couldn't live without it."

You can get astrid tasks, gtasks, or any of a long list of other reminder applications that have more functionality for free and I doubt a single other one that even charges would charge over $2 and as once only price. Clearly designed for the gullible."
7374,A Google user,"January 3, 2012",4,"Previous versions were better It is annoying that  I need to login every time  Iget into RTM,evrn if it was few minutes ago. The widget does not update with latest tasks and shows the old ones that were already closed. I use it with galaxy i9100"
7375,A Google user,"March 26, 2012",1,Very limiting Not too user friendly. Basic reminders need paid pro account to check out.

I use it for work across laptop, desktop, android smart phone and ipad.  I share lists with people who work with me too. The android and ipad format are different from each other but both very good, in fact better than the web based format.    2 useful additions would be drag and drop multiple items from 1 list to another.  And please,  the ability to have sub tasks would be very useful. Very surprised that an other wise excellent app does not have this feature."
7377,A Google user,"April 8, 2012",5,"Best task list This is the best task list out there. Love the prioritizing, tag, n location features. Just wish it could sync tasks Google calendar, but not even Google tasks do that so this is the best."
7378,A Google user,"January 2, 2012",3,"Not so good. Obviously a given-up business idea. Service is quite basic, whether you pay or not."
7379,A Google user,"January 11, 2012",3,Too expensive. Great app. Just plain too expensive for the most useful features (ie reminders).  Wish there were a $5 version that did require an online account and gave the other pro features.
7380,A Google user,"December 28, 2011",3,"Feels unpolished. Don't like the fact that you can only sync once with the site, even with a Pro subscription. I find Any.Do to be a more user friendly app."
7381,A Google user,"April 27, 2012",3,"Good app, but limited functionality This would be a great app, but RTM made the decision to cripple it to force people to buy their overpriced subscription service.  I would be happy to pay for the app.but the annual fee it's too much."
7382,A Google user,"January 18, 2012",2,Tags problem Spaces within a tag are considered as seperate words. Its what  I am frustrated with... Else great
7383,A Google user,"January 16, 2012",4,"Very good Batch operations make things so much easier, but if you have a lot to tags or long tag names, the latest versions will eat a lot of vertical real estate per task for them."
7384,A Google user,"January 19, 2012",4,"Almost Perfect Useful! Too bad no phone hour/minute reminder for free accounts for free accounts. Sometimes, too many clicks to edit and modify tasks."
7385,A Google user,"February 3, 2012",5,Great family app Its simple enough for a family and their little children to use.  Would like to have more advance features so I can use it for projects at work (I have some tech illiterate team members).
7386,A Google user,"February 2, 2012",3,"Useful app Useful & immed accessible via widget, better than Tasks on Outlook/Touchdown which I have. Pleasing interface. However the controls are not well laid/thought out and not intuitive. Needs more work. Will continue to use. David"
7387,A Google user,"February 4, 2012",5,"(almost) perfect Perfect app for organising your life. A few (very) minor things missing (like a proper map to create new locations). Regardless, it's the best app+service in this category. Smooth, fast and reliable."
7388,A Google user,"January 5, 2012",1,"Useless Forces you to sign up for account to use the app = app cant work offline! .. I'm better off with ""tasks n todos"" app."
7389,A Google user,"January 4, 2012",3,"$25!! Would have been a 5 star app if it weren't for the pro upgrade being a $25 annual subscription. What the hell? Just sell it for a few bucks on the market, you'd be much more successful. I'd wager not one person has been stupid enough to pay for this."

Had enough with creating accounts for apps that I am not sure will be used for long so forget it. Some reviews mentioned widgets and reminders are not free. Wanted to do comparisons between this, Tasks n Todos and Taskos but I guess I can save some effort."
7391,A Google user,"April 23, 2012",4,"Almost perfect But it often forgets the folder that you set it to open to, and I need completed tasks to be alphabetical, while other lists ordered by date/priority. Well worth checking out, particularly the Smart List function."
7392,A Google user,"March 13, 2012",4,"Effective & not over complicated. Some other task list apps have so many options and junk on the screen that they are too annoying to use quickly. This one is basic and to the point, with function prioritized over flash."
7393,A Google user,"January 5, 2012",1,Sucks There are lots of free alternatives with more features on market. Wasted my 25$
7394,A Google user,"March 1, 2012",5,"I love RTM This Android application is one I couldn't live without.  I have used RTM for years but this application takes it to a new level of usability.  The widgets make it so easy to get to those items that I use all of the time.  If you need a great to do list app, start here."
7395,A Google user,"March 2, 2012",3,Useful but can be confusing. I am trying to use RTM over multiple devices which can be confusing and difficult especially with only 1 sync a day. Not yet convinced it is worth upgrading.
7396,A Google user,"March 3, 2012",4,Great The paid service is a rip off. However just the free app by itself is worth it.   Simple and we'll designed. My life seems much more organised now.
7397,A Google user,"March 6, 2012",5,"I love it! It sent my to-do list to my email -which is great for people like me who forget to open the app to check my daily list. So, I got the alert on my cell. You can check off your dones or postpone items on your list, or color code your priorities!"
7398,A Google user,"January 9, 2012",4," Very slick and easy to use. The widgets are a little cluttered though, there's really no need to show the date of each task."
7399,A Google user,"December 24, 2011",1, You could have said that Sync is compulsory before I wasted my bandwidth downloading this app. I don't want to sign up with yet another data miner.
7400,A Google user,"December 30, 2011",1,"Too limited demo! Paying without having tested exactly how the reminders work? No thanks! Demo is nice, but make it time limited fully functional! This is a lite version, not a demo."
7401,A Google user,"January 15, 2012",4,"Simple, functional Love this app! Very simple to use, keeps my life in order. I do wish there was a bit more available in the free version (widgets in particular) but understand limiting some features to the premium version."
7402,A Google user,"April 3, 2012",1,"Sync limitation is bad They chose to restrict the wrong feature, i might stop using RTM because i cant see my tasks in my phone, next allowed sync is tomorrow..."
7403,A Google user,"January 21, 2012",4,"UI update Thought the previous UI was more intuitive. Sometimes have trouble with the small buttons in the upper left. Like the new home screen, though."
7404,A Google user,"January 19, 2012",3,3 star average. Restrictions mean it's only worth 1 star.  BUT it's worth 5 stars if you go pro. The ability to notify you when you're near a location assigned to a task is great.
7405,A Google user,"January 23, 2012",4, Older versions made it easier to bump tasks. Now the menu path to defer a task is cumbersome
7406,A Google user,"January 5, 2012",5,"Great, stable app I've tried them all: Google Tasks, Springpad, Jorte. I keep coming back to this one. Powerful, easy to use and great sync with Gmail and Google Calendar."
7407,A Google user,"January 20, 2012",4,"Pricy, but good. RTM is a solid performer. The pro service is kind of expensive for what it is, but it does what it's supposed to do."
7408,A Google user,"March 8, 2012",3,Good app does what it says Good app functions well but way too expensive to go pro and google tasks is free so I might switch. Google tasks also has many third party applications and widgets to manage your tasks and it is free with real time synchronization.
7409,A Google user,"December 18, 2013",3,"Doesn't auto-sync Love this online, but the app stinks. Apparently you can only sync once a day?? What's the point of a mobile app that isn't synchronous with the full version? Oh, wait, you get real syncing with the pro version. Which costs $25 a year?? Seriously?  No, thanks."
7410,A Google user,"February 9, 2012",2,Crippled Great idea but only for 'pro' users who have subscribed at 25USD per year. can only sync to web service once every 24 hours. Useless until you pay unless you only use on one device!
7411,A Google user,"January 7, 2012",5," Very good app. Keeps you up to date and links with outlook with only a couple of sync problems you have to sort every month, or so but 10/10"
7412,A Google user,"December 23, 2011",1,RTM developers please read this. All the features that should be in the free version are pro only... eg. Reminders.... what free task manager can't remind you without paying? Only rtm... and the price to pay is outrageous.. $25? Oh wait yearly...
7413,A Google user,"January 17, 2012",5,"Great app I have pro version so that I can access my stuff on any platform, including my home Outlook.  It has all the features I need and is ridiculously simple.  Best task manager."
7414,A Google user,"January 5, 2012",4,"Versatile and quick! Once I figured out how to enter and/or create labels and tags directly in the text box when adding a task, this app became a great time saver. Would recommend applying list labels and smart tags right away whenever new tasks are added! Would be 5 stars if the widgets were free."
7415,A Google user,"January 17, 2012",5,"Keeps my life in order As a working mom, it is easy to forget all the things that need doing. This app helps me remember my todos, shopping and packing lists, and does it with ease. Love it."
7416,A Google user,"January 26, 2012",4,"Very nice Not sure why I need the $25/ year web portion, the phone app does just fine. Not the most complex ""to do"" app but that's what's nice about it, useful but not overly complicated."
7417,A Google user,"February 21, 2012",4,Useful app I found the interface a bit confusing but I'm now starting to get used it and I'm finding it a very useful app (since I've had it I've not once forgotten the milk!). For me if it could link reminders to emails sent it would be even better.
7418,A Google user,"March 7, 2012",5,"Good For Business & Personal I use RTM in sync with the premium version of tne web application. Despite the quirky name, I find this app more suited to managing a myriad of work and personal tasks than Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar or, Google Notes"

I helped Beta test their first iPhone app. And I've been using the Android app for 2 years now ...  The website version is outstanding and I always have it open while on the computer. And the Android app is pretty much spot on too ... I'd be lost without it!   The only suggestion I can make is for a Mac desktop version. Now that I'm travelling I spend a lot of time offline. ..luckily I have the Android app for those times though :)
7420,A Google user,"February 26, 2012",3,"Useful Good for a free app. Don't like the fact that you can't even see what the widget looks like....SUCKS. Membership fee ($25) to go ""pro"" is bull... its not buying the app but paying a fee on their site to use their services."
7421,A Google user,"January 14, 2012",4,"Works great on Galaxy Nexus Very capable, but a bit expensive for the yearly subscription if you don't need it all. Home screen widget is very useful."

7426,A Google user,"January 29, 2012",5,"Nice interface Great update. I always found RTM handy, but the new app update cleaned up some of the annoyances. Quickly able to get to lists."
7427,A Google user,"March 24, 2012",1,"Great advertising to suck you in. If a reminder program makes you pay for the privilege of testing its reminders, then there is a chance the rest of it isn't much good either.   thanks for not much.   makes a mockery of the whole star rating thing.      Cheers."
7428,A Google user,"January 3, 2012",5, Tried all kinds of note apps with or without reminders.  By far my favorite note app.  I really like having tags as well as lists.  Well thought out.

Remember the Milk allows me to create any number of lists for work, school, home and personal tasks. I sync it to Google Calendar as well as use the app on my phone.
