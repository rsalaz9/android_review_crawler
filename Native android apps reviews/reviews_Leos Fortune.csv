I thought it would be a boring game and wondered if it was worth the price but I trusted the reviews and it actually was very good! Certainly one of my top favorite mobile games on the Play Store. It's super challenging and would keep you on your toes. The graphics and sound are amazing and the story line is quite good and kinda reminds you of a life lesson.
1,jorge Paniagua,"March 30, 2020",5," The last comment I saw said that for Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus it does not work that properly, I have been playing this game since I have a Samsung A50 and it worked fantastic, now I have the S10 Plus and It is still working incredibly, I have no problems with controlling Leo, it's amazing"

3,Subba Lakshmi,"February 16, 2020",4," Very very good game, nice experience but the only issue is I think price to value is not ok, it has very limited content compared to its price. It would be better if you add more content to it or lower the price."
4,Aman Nagpal,"March 20, 2020",5, The only draw bag for thesegame is the levels are very less and for buying these game at a 450 rupes in not worth it. It is too cost to buy But overall game performance is good.

14,Jennifer Venkat,"March 12, 2020",5," Very nice game, makes me think and is challenging 😇"
15,Rufis Samadzade,"January 25, 2020",1," It was a very nice game but screen size is not appropriate Galaxy S10 Android10 and it is stretched. The first touched buttons it did not react then I found out it reacts when you push 5mm to the right, and this is for all touches. In other words buttons are not aligned with places you touch."
16,Ivan Paul,"January 25, 2020",5," Amazing game with good gameplay. Good story, but very small that I finished it in a very short span. One of my favorite Android games."
17,Amir Safari,"January 25, 2020",1, Great game but it keeps freezing and closing sometimes by it self or when loading the game main menu becomes a black screen and the touch is not calibrated when i want click on a mission e.g mission 1 you have to click on mission 2 to play mission 1 but it does not effect the gameplay
18,Danial Abdullah,"January 25, 2020",3, Please put in option to fit s8 display. Black back at the left and right is just not acceptable. And maybe option to run at higher fps.
19,wasim shah,"April 6, 2020",5," Very adventurous game, but please update more stages."

This is why phone games are all getting a bit pants; either you can never own the game and have to continue paying ridiculous amounts, or you do buy the game and it becomes redundant. Poor show. I'll stick to consoles I think."

However, when installing on my S10+, none of the buttons work and the screen ratio was weird. For those with the same problem, go into: Settings >> Full Screen Apps >> Scroll down to Leo's Fortune >> Change Auto to Full Screen. After this, the buttons work much better and the screen ratio is almost perfect. Certainly much more playable/enjoyable. Hope this helps anyone else :)"

26,Johan van Staden,"March 28, 2020",4," Super fun, and interesting levels. Challenging but not frustrating. Still compatible after all these years."

It's a very challenging game, but I think it's all worth it at the end! The story is very lovely. Old fashioned, but lovely. The reson I deducted one star is there is a cog at level 10 that doesn't have a purpose. Wonder why it's there. If there ever is a pillow shaped as Leo floating, I will buy it! If who ever made this game see this, why not consider it an opportunity? Best 5.53(tax) spent ever."

Worth the money in gameplay, but not in time, but does try to make it up with end-game challenges. Besides that, however, the game is super fun. Cute, great graphics, amazing storyline, just the right amount of a challenge, it's fun for every age! I do all in all recommend this game, you won't regret it!"
31,Jung Hyun Noh,"November 4, 2018",3," I love the graphics in this game. They are phenomenal. The storyline is great and well. One disappointing thing is that there are only 20 levels. But the controls are horrible, they don't work well at all. That is one major con for to this game. I wouldn't recommend it for a jaw dropping 5 dollars. ...Full ReviewI love the graphics in this game. They are phenomenal. The storyline is great and well.

But it requires a certain screen ratio... so it will work on your old galaxy S7 but anything without that screen ratio will not work (a discrepancy between the placement of the buttons and the visuals of them )Sad that I would need to dust off my old phone just to play it. Sorry it won't happen: (

36,Andrew Cunningham,"May 29, 2019",4," I love this game, and I personally believe it's worth the price. A simple, but great story, and fantastic music and graphics. To add, there's even a level of replay ability to earn perfect scores on levels, and speedruns. I highly recommend!"

I love this game the visuals are stunning and I just hope to get another game like this very soon from this developer I have been waiting since the 1st game was released for a sequel it's that great & amazing!"
38,Simon Wolstencroft,"October 5, 2019",4," Nice game, I find it hard to control on a phone. I was under the impression it was an escape style game when it purchased it but it's more about being able to control Leo through the mazes. Frustrating for a 47 year old but still a great little game and nice graphics."
39,Concord Gaming,"November 4, 2019",5," Love this game, runs smoothly on all devices I have tried, and offers great gameplay and an engaging story. Would recommend ☆☆☆☆☆"
40,Tina Claypoole,"November 24, 2019",1, I can not get the game to go past the first level. It just starts over. I paid for this game and I would like to continue on with it. Please fix!
41,Isaac Sumner,"January 11, 2019",5," Kirby-Mario is an amazing game! Seriously, this game delivers a polished experience that is on par with Mario or Sonic game. This game has an excellent look and feel. Most importantly the controls are actually good. You can't say that for many phone platformers."
42,Blue McKone,"August 30, 2019",5, This game is Amazing! The challenges get harder with each level and the game is free! Other then when you buy the game but there is no in game items you need to buy like all the others! reccomend this game completly

44,Mayes Jam,"September 21, 2019",5," I've beaten this game on my phone and ps4. Absolutely fantastic! Top quality visuals, great and fun physics, interesting puzzles and levels, voice acting and pin point touch screen controls. It's always a joy to play this game! I hope a 2nd one comes out."
45,Tim Larson,"September 26, 2018",5," Amazing game. This is what mobile gaming needs more of. Sadly gems like this are rare in the age of pay 2 win, micro transaction BS. This game deserves our financial support so we get more games like it."
46,Frank Smith,"October 15, 2018",1," Game is way too short. For a game that costs $4.99, 20 short levels is way too short and easy. I was expecting a lot more after watching the trailer and reading the reviews. Great concept but not worth the money."
47,Stanley Strickland,"September 30, 2019",4, Certain buttons is not working on my note 10 plus. I uninstalled it and tried reinstalling it and still have the same issues. I've beating this game a few times but its sucks that it isn't working now.
48,anuj vakharia,"May 24, 2019",5," Good game overall, stunning graphics, good storyline, loveable character and innovative game mechanics. Worth the buy! Would be nice if the app recieved regular updates (not that there's any issue wjth the current version)"
49,A Google user,"December 15, 2018",5, It's an amazing game but I just wish the animations for each button was faster so that I can for example restart the level faster without having to wait for the options to finish popping up.
50,A Google user,"November 5, 2018",4," Absolutely astonishing game! Wonderful graphics, smooth gameplay. Totally worth the money. One star less because the resolution of the menu should be updated."
51,Sergiu Stoian,"March 25, 2019",5," Great game... Graphics are impressive, and the Hardcore mode run is quite a challenge that keeps you trying again and again even after you finish the game once."
52,John Mota,"April 7, 2019",1, The game needs to be updated. I recently got the new Galaxy s10+ but the resolution on the game needs to be fixed and I also can't play or go to settings. Please fix this and I will gladly review 5 star again after I get to play successfully

You make a slight mistake due to the sloppy controls, die, respawn, then have to open the menu to restart. This game needs an option (preferably when you start a level) to automatically restart on death.  If you're like me and really want to get full ranking on a level before moving on to the next, this isn't your game."
215,T Brown,"December 26, 2016",5,Nexus 6p running 7.0 Nougat Please give this game Android 7.0 Nougat support. The game is only a black screen with audio playback on my Nexus 6p. PLEASE UPDATE I WANT TO PLAY.                    EDIT: Thanks alot for supporting Android 7.0 it finally works!

The amount paid up front for this game is worth it totally. Absolutely 
beautiful, detailed worlds to move through, the graphics are awesome and 
interesting to look at. Leo the puffball is hilarious and so realistic. 
Unlimited lives, no big deal if you die, you just pop back. My kids and I 
have had lots of laughs at all the silly ways we try to make a move and get 
killed. It sounds morbid, but bc he's a puffball it's just funny. The 
gameplay is fantastic, not boring at all and not overly difficult where it 
isn't enjoyable to play. Love his deep Spanish accent too! The best part of 
all is being able to play and enjoy a game without constantly being hounded 
to spend money! Thank You!"
217,Sonu Kashyap,"January 1, 2018",3, This game is very good but only thing which I don't like.. there is no option to turn off game sound. If you want to enjoy songs with this game on your mobile. It won't work even as a paid version.
218,Abhash Chatterjee,"May 19, 2017",5," Awesome Game. But the game is easy to complete. Only 20 levels. I finished the game in just 2 days. For 300 bucks, one would expect more levels. Although earning all stars in every level is very difficult. Nevertheless​, hope sequel comes out for this. Its a great game."

I'm on wifi, great connection, but the download is always paused, and I have to wait a long time, as in an entire night for the download to finish. This has never happened with any other of my apps or games. I will rate it higher if this is fixed."

...Full ReviewThis game has the most gorgeous graphics from start to finish, the music 
and sound effects are also excellent. The game is a real joy to play, a 
little on the easy side if you want to rush through the twenty four levels 
taking advantage of the unlimited lives and restart points, which are never 
far from where you die, but to get all the stars and complete the game 
properly will take much longer than the couple of hours it takes to rush 
through. The game also has a really nice storyline which plays out between 
the levels, again with terrific graphics, which are in black and white. The 
puzzles are fairly easy, but still good fun to work out. All in all, a 
brilliant and clever platform game, and one of the best I have ever 
played... As a note to the developers of Leo's Fortune, I would suggest 
lives were not infinite, but limited at the start of each level with extra 
lives earned by collecting practically everything to be found in the level. 
The puzzles could be harder and more devious, requiring a bit more effort 
to work them out, and maybe a load of hidden extras requiring a lot more 
searching, like in the Donkey Kong games. One more thing, if you are not 
already doing so, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make either another Leo game, or 
something similar... 9.95 / 10"
221,sherry pfeil,"March 20, 2018",5," Awesome game, fun, addictive, challenging with great graphics. Makes a great one time purchase lots of game play for the price compared to freemium games! Totally worth the $5, love Leo and his little laugh.."
222,Laurie Sand,"March 14, 2018",5," Lighthearted, great graphics, interesting puzzles. Somewhat difficult to play on my Note 5 phone screen (which is pretty big), probably better suited to a tablet."
223,Mary Tee,"November 6, 2019",4, Yeh...yeh...the graphics are good but trying to save a game or changing sound level...well good luck. Finally finished the game. Good physics but should be able to save game at current location rather than being forced to restart the entire level.
224,N. D. C.,"February 11, 2018",5," I absolutely LOVE this game. No words can describe it. The beautiful graphics and challenge make it the best platformed for Android, period. Plus, the hint of voice acting is also a nice touch."
225,Andrews Dean,"July 1, 2017",5, The game is worth paying for. The graphics are so stunning and voice over is nice too. Some of the levels are real brain cracker and I really enjoy solving the puzzles while finding my way out. Highly recommended!
226,Lane,"November 14, 2017",2, I've had this game a few weeks now and it's about to get uninstalled. I've completed three levels in a few weeks. Three levels. You try and try then you just have to leave the app because the level is so annoying. Oh well.
227,Jishnu Kaiwar,"November 25, 2017",4," Loved everything, though would like an option to play on mute so I can listen to music while slogging levels, also, more levels would be nice :)"
228,Michael Brayshaw,"February 28, 2017",5, Really enjoyed so far. Beautiful graphics and clever physics based puzzles. Could do with an option to increase the size of touch based control for left and right. It's a bit too sensitive I think.
229,S U,"March 19, 2017",1," It doesn't download all the levels. After paying for this stupid game, I can't get my money's worth. Even some of the levels on the second and third stage don't load anymore. This is a scam"
230,Ed Richardson,"August 2, 2019",4," Great, beautiful, fun! Works brilliantly on Shield TV... (Edit) I removed a star because it is all over too soon. Too short for the price tag, you are pretty much paying for the graphics and polish. Solid and beautiful game but way to short."
231,Márton László Wankó,"January 19, 2017",5, Played it on the PS4 -  loved it. Love it on mobile as well but the controls aren't as good as wish they were. Still worth every cent.
232,A Google user,"September 17, 2017",5, This game is very addicting and its incredible. The graphics and the controls work very well. This game is definitely worth the money. The last level is kind of hard but fun. Im so glad that I found this game.😺😺😺😻😻😻
233,Eric Hughes,"April 30, 2017",5," In my opinion, the greatest game on Android currently. I hope the developers continue to put out new and similar games."

242,Mark F.,"May 15, 2018",5," Great but when you pause the game and return to it later in the day, it's 
gone back to the Main Menu and you have lost your place in the game 😕"

Personally, I liked the game play as well as the character. Unfortunately, the game was repeptitive and it seemed to get difficult only by increasing the number of spikes and be artisric about the way they are implemented in the adventure.

It also benefits from creative level designs that blend elements of DKC, Sonic The Hedgehog, as well as elegantly implemented puzzles. But perhaps it's greatest achievement is its innovative controls. There are no fixed positions for on screen buttons. This eliminates the usual frustrations associated with playing this type of game on a touch screen."

The graphics remind me of ps4, yep I said it, they are that good. I feel guilty that I bought this on sale because the devs deserve a lot more for this. Well done. I will look into other titles you have made for sure. If you haven't got this yet, get it now. Thanks again devs. EDIT: I couldn't find any other titles. Is this the only one you have made?"
525,Arktria,"March 8, 2017",5," More people should totally have this game, its addicting and challenging. It keeps your brain occupied and happy. One thing though, can you make an option for instead of slide up and hold we could tap and hold? I tend to do that and then forget I have to swipe up so please do that!"

My only complaint is that the only reason to play some of the bonus levels, or find the golden cogs is for the achievements. You could easily skip a third of the game or more if you are only interested in the main story. I didn't bother with half of the side levels once I realized there is no point."

That's before we get to gameplay. You are Leo who is looking for his fortune.

Great graphics, excellent controls, and a well constructed level design show off a great amount of polish.  On the downside is the incredible shortness. The game can be completed between 2 or 3 hours. Those minutes are a great experience, but don't expect longevity in its 20 levels. Replay value is in acquiring additional stars which is greatly difficult for some levels."

I recommend this game to anyone looking for something different."
530,Christian Mendoza,"December 21, 2014",5,Very hard but very fun and beautiful I love getting 3 starts in every level. What makes this game great if the ability to get 1 start at a time instated of having to get it at once. Giving this game more replay and a bit more challenging. If you don't care about the stars the game is till a fun little platform

Leo's Fortune is a AAA platformer that feels like it was made for touch screen devices, and nothing was really sacrificed to accomplish this.  The story is told through Leo's mutterings to himself during gameplay and a few short cut scenes between the four sections of the game. The developers did a good job of crafting an immersive and intriguing story without it getting in the way of the gameplay too much. Something essential for mobile gaming.  The game is easy to pick up and play by anyone, and has no learning curves. I never felt frustrated by the controls, and the level design is smart and intuitive. You get the hang of gliding through the gorgeous environments fairly quickly.  I really can't say enough good things about this game. If you're looking for a fun, modern platformer for your phone and tablet, I can't recommend this highly enough."

Adventure games are supposed to be exciting but this seems to be more of a strategy game rather than adventure. It seems to be missing something that would make it more exciting. Not sure what though... Maybe it's the eerieness and the slow pace of the game and that there aren't any enemies to conquer or avoid with the scenes.
638,Mark Messiha,"November 2, 2014",5,Great game worth the cost I can't tell you how nice it is to play a game that in no way advertises to you. I know the price is a little higher compared to much of the play store but I think its worth it for a fun game that doesn't bombard you with ads.
639,UTR LIVE,"December 28, 2014",5,I just played the game trough without stopping once Truly a very good game great graphics great game play very difficult but I ended up loving this game. Just got done with the castle of illusion great game also these two have been my favorite phone apps in a long time thank you
640,Ben Cook,"July 25, 2015",5,Great Game Only issue is my thumbs getting sore from rubbing the screen so much. They have on-screen buttons to solve this problem but it isn't as fun for me. Still great look and great physics. Love playing it.

The 3D graphics, music, controls, challenges etc. Looks amazing on my Note 4's 2K screen! Please keep updating with more levels! Can't put it down! Got it on sale for 99 cents and I think it's worth more. Love this game!"

I can't get over how stunning the visuals are. The game is always running at a silky 60fps, and never did it stutter, pause or skip a frame. If more games were like this one, in that you pay and play, then everything would be better in the mobile sphere. No IAP nonsense. I doff my hat to the developer(s) of this game.

Likeable protagonist. Works well with touch controls. My only gripe is that this game relies a lot on trial and error. Instead of seeing upcoming pitfalls, spikes, and the like, you just kind of have to run into them to know they're there. Fortunately, there are many checkpoints, so this minor complaint doesn't aggravate. Everything else about the game is very good. Easily 5 stars."

If I were to suggest one thing, it'd be a Hardcore mode: Death = level reset. It'd make the quest for a no-deaths run a little faster."

649,Vic Anand,"January 11, 2017",2,"Great game, difficult controls Let me start by saying that I love this game and have played it all the way through to the end. On my PC. The game itself is wonderful, but I find the controls on a touchscreen to be quite difficult to work with. This game was much more enjoyable on a PC with a keyboard."
650,Francisco Navarrete,"January 8, 2015",2,Ok Well you know what it's a really good game. I just hate how choppy it is when I try to speed up. It's annoying and it's making me a refund...
651,Hayden Schaffner,"November 27, 2015",4,Fantastic game. Unique graphics. Interesting story line. Somewhat difficult puzzles that are fun to solve. Overall great game. The only critique I have it that the controls are a bit stiff and sometimes unresponsive. Love the game though! Well worth the  $
652,Cassandra Grote,"November 7, 2014",3," Puzzles get annoying, I did end up watching the walkthrough I just wanted more from the game. The lesson is amazing though. It's very fun but tiring doing the same old things."
653,Stewart C. Alastair,"December 21, 2015",5,Crazy Graphics! Real brain teaser. I waste way too much time playing this game. I'm really really glad this is NOT a pay as you play app. One price for a great game.
654,Thomas Aucott,"September 15, 2015",5,Beautiful & Unique play + art style. This game really is an amazing example of design and coding. My hat comes off to the company that developed this game. I originally saw it on steam and thought that id get it on my phone. Well done!
655,A Google user,"October 6, 2015",5,Xperia Z1 no problem Plays very smooth and looks the same. I really like platform games and this side scrolling one is good so far. Shame it takes so long to find games like this on here. Glad I did.
656,Kelvin Arnold,"January 7, 2016",5," Immersing graphic, good story, had no problem at all when download and run this app. But why people complaining this good game anyway? Is because their internet connection that fail thier download or they have not enough ram to run this game?"

But the gameplay itself is the tired, collect coins platforming that's been overdone. The controls are annoyingly slippery & floaty, that you find yourself unable to stop your character from overshooting platforms. Puzzles are simplistic at best, the platforming is far more difficult. I especially hated the ramp sections, they've prevented me from finishing the game so far."
660,Arttu Juntunen,"February 10, 2016",5,"What graphics! I was a bit hesitant to buy this came because it seemed a bit expensive, but after playing it for a while i can say its worth the money. The visuals are great and the atmosphere is very captivating. The level design is good too."
661,Kostas Andrianos,"January 21, 2016",3,"Too difficult OK it is awesome, I love the story, the soundtrack and all but it is ridiculously difficult and drives me mad. You finish a level in 7 minutes and to get a star you have to finish it in 3, which is impossible. I just wanna meet the person who got three stars on everything"

718,Daniel Thompson,"December 28, 2015",5,"Perfect tablet game Lovely world and graphics, good voice acting and story, the puzzles are sublime and the difficulty increases as the game progresses. The music is a delight and the controls are excellent. Can't fault this game in any way."
719,Artie Albano,"September 11, 2015",5,"Beautiful to behold One of the nicest looking and well thought games. Leo has a great personality and sense of humor too. Levels can be very difficult though.. I can overlook that ,as this is a brilliant game."

723,Grant A.,"January 15, 2015",5,"Very good game It's been awhile since I've played a game this good. Gameplay is fun and challenging. Graphics are amazing. The only thing I don't like about the game, is that there is no mute button. That's the only thing I don't like."
724,Heather Spiers,"February 22, 2016",3, I actually really enjoyed this game. They lost two stars for not bothering to give you a mute option. I really can't imagine why they would do that. The times to complete levels in order to get a star are on the short side.
725,Pulin Agrawal,"January 1, 2016",4,a treat very well made game. unique gameplay only problem is that controls are not adjustable. it feels odd for me to control direction with left thumb I realized I played better with the reverse configuration. also the left right control's sensitivity is not adjustable

This game is just mediocre in terms of difficulty. The graphics is stellar though. While the music is okay, the tracks are very short. This game is nowhere near as good as the ones like : Machinarium, Limbo, The Room etc(these are vastly superior). I feel like 5 bucks is too much money to spend on this one. I wish if I could get my money back."
727,Alexandr Deliu,"March 5, 2016",2,"It's good The only reason i put 2 stars its because there are no more levels, i liked the game, but 5$ for only 20levels its not serious ! Add more levels !!!"

The graphics are great and stunning. The music and effects are awesome too. This game would need a controller for better maneuverability. The onscreen controls are not consistent and it frustrates you most of the times (by not giving you the swing you expecting). This game requires several retries to finish them with a perfect score. I have given up trying to win the bonus levels, they are extremely difficult. And the ACT 3 and 4 have high level of difficulty in completing within the time-frame and without losing lives. Despite it, it deserves a 5*"

806,Ganna Koval,"October 21, 2015",5," Would recommend to others.  Awesome game with a bit of a back story to the game, laced with mystery. My two biggest problems was that it takes only a day to complete the entire game, and it seems pricy, $3 seems more reasonable."
807,DARPAN GANGULI,"July 17, 2015",5,Worth the price!! You could completely rule out any skepticism regarding the purchase of this game. The gameplay on my Galaxy S6 is too good and the rendered graphic quality  left me in complete awe of the devs. Kudos!
808,Umer Sohail,"January 3, 2016",1,I hate it Because act 4 dosent work and I want my money back! Fraud!
809,Harry Ahmad,"November 5, 2014",5,"So much fun ..im never addicted to any android games since angry bird n piano tiles, but this one is so amusing to play."
810,Bogdan Stanciu,"December 24, 2014",3,"Cool game with completely unreasonable battery usage First downloaded on a one plus one and played for 10 minutes. an hour later and my battery had dropped had 50% (even though i had closed the app properly). Verified across moto g, and a touchpad running android. I don't know why it needs to run in background after i quit the game, but no bueno"
811,Harisha Kumar K,"January 7, 2015",5,"Superb Game Awesome story, graphics but little difficult. It increases stress rather than relieving stress. I face problems with Google play achievements."
812,Aaron Garner,"January 15, 2015",5,"Loved the game It seemed short tho. I wish there were more levels, more deception and betrayal. I would love it so much more!"
813,Cori,"December 25, 2014",4," It's like a weird mixture of Zoombinis and Sonic. The graphics are wonderful and beautiful. Very easy to control, but it's a short game and the story line isn't all that interesting."
814,Joseph Calabria,"February 2, 2015",5,Engrossing gameplay and amazing graphics. Very exciting and detailed worlds with amazing colours. The game is definitely worth its price tag ($3.49 CAD on sale) and is something that should be tried by anyone. Great mobile game.
815,James Tindale,"July 18, 2015",5,"Beautiful game This is the best game I've played for a long time, on any platform.   Graphically it looks stunning, the story is good, but most importantly the gameplay is fantastic and the difficulty curve is just about right.  The challenge of doing rack level without losing a life also adds good replayability ."
816,Karar Kaif Khan anan,"April 28, 2016",5,Excellent graphics and challenging Not every game is as like as it is. Graphics is good. Not addicted type! That's a major plus point. And little bit tricky which get you excited to solve those puzzle more and more. Overall nice game.
817,Srikanth N,"November 28, 2014",4,"Best Adventure themed game. The concept is very good, loved playing it. Loved the character. Wish the game was lengthy, as I was able to complete it in only 5 hours :(. Hope you release same kind of games.  👍"
818,Andres Velasquez,"April 28, 2017",5, Love it. Only thing i dont like is that i cant enable the buttons use in my Ascend Mate 7... Everything else is perfect...great story. Wondeful graphics!! :)
819,Noor Mahomed Essa,"August 16, 2015",3,Good but not worth the money Is don't have much levels and after you finished the game you don't really want to play it again. The story is great but in the end it is just not worth the buy
820,SupremoWill SW,"September 16, 2016",5,"This game is awesome Very good graphics. Excelente environment.  Good story, good puzzles wao very impressed with this game. I recommend, it's smooth, no lags.. depend of your device of course, but it's very easy to play , awesome game"
821,Karim,"September 20, 2016",2,"Dont waste your money Yes it does have nice graphics and sound, but the controls are very annoying."
822,Jerowin Tinawin,"January 13, 2016",5,"Amazing! Great user interface, controls aren't complex, and especially great background design on each levels. Best parts are the challenges to get the 3 stars. In short, worth the pay and fun story line."
823,Rico Boogie,"June 10, 2015",4,"Excellent graphics. This game is fun to play and a good way to pass the time while on the subway but it desperately needs an option to turn off, or at the very least, reduce the in-game music and SFX. It's really annoying that I can't listen to my music while playing."
824,Gy F,"February 28, 2015",5,A fun game Needs more levels and a little better controls. Love solving new puzzles getting a higher score on every level not so much. Still a great game
825,Jani Miettinen,"March 3, 2016",3,"Controls are the enemy I would like to love this game, but I just cannot get used to the controls. Why there is no option to switch the controls to opposite sides?"
826,Steph,"May 29, 2016",3,"Issue with controller The controller doesn't work properly, 4 times on 5 you die because controller doesn't respond properly to swipe or stop working in the middle of a movement, cancelling it. Very frustrating. Should be fixed."

I really like that Leo can touch spikes lightly without dying. That said I'd have preferred to play it on PC with keyboard or gamepad and a less zoomed in camera. I've often died simply because camera doesn't allow me to react to new dangers as I see them and instead I have to rely on memorisation, which is probably fine for this type of game, but a bit more leeway to react would have been nice."
828,Holly Taylor,"May 31, 2015",5,"Beautiful game, lovely story to go with it. Super cute game. I'm even picky about the quality of games I play and this one is refreshingly clean and the graphics are very nice.  Runs smoothly on my Galaxy S5. Give it a try!"
829,Giorgos Angelis,"August 25, 2015",5,"Awesome This is one of the best mobile games I have ever played. If you are hesitant about paying for this game, let me tell you, it is worth it."

The graphics are wonderful. I'm taking away a star because  there's now button to turn off or turn down the audio. That's insane. Most low quality games have this option. This game costs actual money. There should be some sort of sound option. I don't like having to adjust my phone's sound for one game.  I took away two stars because I can't save my place on the game. That is a major problem. I am on stage 1, level 4. So far I've started playing three or four times and got interrupted or called away and had to start over. I'm kind of over it. There should be a way to pause and save the game right where you're at. Even if I simply pause the game and switch to a different app without closing this app, after a little while, it makes me start over. No one wants that in a game like this."
832,Vaibhav Singh,"June 22, 2015",4,Samsung galaxy S6 Edge A great game with amazing graphics. Also a bit challenging at times. If there were more levels it would have been better.
833,Pratyush Panda,"December 24, 2014",5,Can't stop playing Great game with immersing graphics and a story that will make you never want to put your phone down. Very addicting.
834,suresh cherungottil,"January 23, 2015",5,"Good Game !!!!! Hints at some tricky situations would have been helpful. Instead of stolen gold being dropped on the way,  stolen booty hidden at various landmarks would make the game more challenging."

836,JJ Hollsy,"July 10, 2016",5,"Amazing The graphics are great, the music suits every level, I love the puzzles you have to solve, and every aspect of the game is perfect. I have become quite addicted to the game and find it more than worth the small price I bought it for. This game is amazing."
837,Kristy Koeneman,"January 6, 2016",5,"Awesome game! I splurged and got this game. I LOVE it!!!!!! So much fun. My only tiny complaint is is skipped the tutorial by accident, so I had to switch controls. Amazing game, otherwise. I'm addicted."
838,marcia delreal,"June 3, 2015",5,"Awesome. I passed by this game a couple times because of the price, then one day I decided to go for it. Man, am I so glad I did. So very addictive, the graphics are great and at the story line is adorable."

So, you have to keep redoing the same, boring, stupid parts that are just exhausting.  Perhaps whoever coded this could consult with someone like the folks who wrote Skyrim so they can learn how to code save routines.  This game is nauseatingly repetitious at best.  It's perfect for people who aren't familiar with how really professionally coded games are written, but it doesn't fly with me.  I've long held that most game developers today have a secret disdain for their players and this game only fortifies that belief for me.  This game is a great example of how we in the U.S. have become accepting of slip shod quality and just don't care anymore."
842,A Google user,"December 28, 2015",2,"I hate one major thing in the game I hate the fact that you can not stop the music. When you play, you have to hear their own loud and annoying music instead of your own. Awful decision on the developer side"
843,Alasdair Grant,"January 6, 2015",5,"Super fun Game is not too hard, characters are adorable. 2/3 of the way through campaign and never felt like quitting."
844,Caia Bixby,"February 13, 2016",5,Beautiful and Challenging Quirky and unique character with a beautiful art style and a simple but immersive story. Gameplay is challenging but not so difficult that it's discouraging.

847,Josué Nduwayo,"December 26, 2015",4,"Almost perfect The gameplay is beyond perfection. In my opinion, the only con to this title is the lack of sound controls.... Please see to this long coming issue, thanks!"
848,Shivam Bist,"December 3, 2016",5,"Download paused For playing the second stage it requires additional content to download. It shows no internet connection even though I'm connected to wifi, and it always show the ""download paused ""notification whenever I open the game..please fix it"

Well the game is nice and funny to play, but why do you NOT offer the option to turn the sound off? ANY other game has that option! I would like to listen to what I want on my own phone, not to your silly background theme/ sound fx"
853,Johnson Khalkho,"December 30, 2015",5,Amazing graphics... Graphics is amazing.. Best 2d game.. But who played games like  linbo (pc) this game is much much easy to play.. I compleate it in just 2 days..

863,Amer Khaznadar,"April 8, 2015",5," This game is great, and not only by mobile/tablet standards. My only nitpick is that the music loops are very short so they get boring quickly. Played on a SHIELD tablet with a controller."

866,Imre Olajos,"January 5, 2015",5,Beautiful puzzler Essentially a non-violent puzzle-solver and platformer that is beautifully rendered. Appeals to kids and adults alike. Plays equally well on touchscreens and on Android TV. Kudos to the developers!
867,Joseph Waters,"January 28, 2018",5," I absolutely adored this game! The graphics are top-notch, the story is great and sounds like it was written by a high-class author, the gameplay is great for it being limited, and it's just so fun for it being only $5! Well done! You deserve a gold star, not just 5 stars from me!"
868,James Chanler,"February 1, 2016",5, Maybe the best Android game I've ever played. Amazing platformer. The controls are simple and the level design is great. I was sad when I finished this game because I didn't want to put it down.
869,Manas Das,"September 22, 2015",5," Very addictive game. First time I saw it, felt like such a simple game. But it grows more and more interesting with each level. And each level is different. Levels are short so that you don't get bored. A perfect game."
870,Edgar Torres,"June 5, 2016",5,"One of the best android games. Wonderful game, wort every penny, also you may spend a few dollars but won't need to spend anymore on jewels like ""free games"" you won't get ads, and it's fun, easy to play, some puzzles are very hard but it just take a few seconds before and you can keep trying again"

910,Charlie Kay,"August 1, 2015",5,"Phenomenal Title This game is probably one of the best tablet titles I have ever played. It's exciting, artistic, simple, and doesn't rely on adds or freemium additions! It's well worth the price and I highly recommend it - you'll fall in love with the sweet story and the gorgeous world."
911,violette creel,"December 19, 2015",3,It's pretty but I'm stuck on one level... Seriously!?! I've been playing the game for a while and its fun and all but it's just so frustrating sometimes!
912,Mrutyunjaya Jena,"September 8, 2015",5, Love this Game.....Great graphics and tricky puzzles. The controls are also very simple and it's fun to play. What made it special for me was when I started playing this game I had the exact same mustache as leo does. So it was like I was part of that adventure for real.
913,Josh L,"May 20, 2015",5,High quality graphics and gameplay! If I were to say any one thing about this game it would be that the pictures lie... The actual gameplay is way better than the pictures show!!!!!
914,Colton Porky,"February 5, 2015",5," Best mobile game I've ever played - the graphics, voice acting, music, story and, of course, gameplay are all top notch. Definitely worth buying; while on sale, it's a steal."
915,John Van Ham,"January 24, 2015",5,"Great fun, no stress! Charming and funny and a bit silly too with great graphics and simple (so far) puzzles. Bit like a platform game with puzzles along the way and far more flow."

929,Bailey Kubesh,"December 27, 2014",4,"Amazing I really thoroughly enjoyed the game. It was outstanding. The only problem I had with it is it was to short. I wish there were more levels or something. I want more content to it. Otherwise, like I said, it was outstanding"
930,William Volkema,"November 28, 2014",5,Awesome Clever clever game controls are touchy at first buy once you get used to it works great. We need more game like this instead of silly runner games
931,Jodi Middleton,"January 23, 2015",5,Stunning Fun to play and amazing to look at. Plus a good story as well. Very well thought out levels to boot. The best part is... No pay to win!
932,Parichaya Chatterji,"December 14, 2014",4,"Great game. I didn't mind paying about S$5 for this, because of the awesome graphics and great gameplay. But I feel a bit cheated in that it's a short game, I finished it (the  main story) in about 2 days. They should have added more stories in this game for that amount of money."
933,Ken Williams,"June 3, 2015",4," Beautiful graphics, supportive music, somewhat challenging gameplay, and a quaint story.

However, the game does not take too long to complete, and other than trying to achieve perfect or better statistics, ongoing playtime isn't incentivized. In sum, I feel it a wonderful little game that really shows investment in production, but probably should be priced slightly lower."
934,Asm Ifti,"September 26, 2016",5,"A vastly entertaining game full of wonderful mysteries Love the graphics, love the levels, love the mysterious twists and critical and puzzling obstacles, absolutely love the game. No doubt a 100% worth the money :)"

As everyone says the graphics are awesome. Really gorgeous looking levels and character model that show off the capability of mobile devices. When you can have a game look this good and still run @ close to 60 FPS, you have a good mobile game.   The soundtrack fits and adds depth. At no point have I felt annoyed by the soundtrack and muted the game so I could listen to my music while playing.    Gameplay is solid. At the games core Leo's Fortune is a physics based platformer with puzzles thrown in. Feels like Sonic the Hedgehog and World of Goo mixed together (in a good way). This is a game that could only exist as a mobile game and I like how the developers took advantage of this fact rather than trying to make the game something that would have been better if it was on PC.  Generous checkpoint system and faster paced gameplay are great for casual players. Global score (level time) and completion stars add replay value for purist and speed-runners.    Cons?  -24 levels @ 5 to 6 minutes each (1st playthrough) makes for a shorter game.  -Puzzles not hard enough? True. But this is a speed-running game. -Requires full attention and both hands"
937,Timothy Mattson,"December 9, 2014",5,Great Game Smooth fluid gameplay is a huge plus.  This is one of the few games out there where the developers actually cared about making it play well.
938,Teena Rossiter,"January 11, 2015",5,"Awesome game!! Best game yet!!  Challenging, but not impossible.  The graphics are beautiful.  It was so entertaining that I was disappointed when I completed all of the levels."
939,Mehdi Hosseyni,"March 1, 2015",4,"AMAZING... Super awesome fun game, with great visuals. Definitely worth the buy. But please optimise for android 5.0, its quite slow and lags a bit."
940,MasterSzz,"September 5, 2016",5,"Very fun game. very fun game although it does tend to get a bit tough and you can die alot, still very challenging and fun, especially challenging on hard-core mode, if not impossible."
941,Johan Andresen,"March 25, 2015",4,"Great game, but... The game itself is extremely good,but it annoys me that you can't disable the sound, as I often listen to music while playing."
942,Edlu79,"January 10, 2019",5," Este juego me encanto tiene exelentes gráficos y una banda sonora exelente, valió la pena comprarlo ojalá agregarán más niveles para seguir con la diversión pero bueno me encanto este grandioso juego se los recomiendo muuuuuuuuuucho :)"

945,Alec Joy,"April 5, 2015",5,"Excellent title This is a great mobile platformer that really raises the bar for mobile games on the whole. I've sunk many many hours in to this one, decent enough story, good mechanics and great reward system. Can't wait to start hardcore mode."
946,Garen Nerses,"April 28, 2015",5,"This game.. Didn't have high expectations for this game at first but bought it anyway because it looked nice and was 80% off but I'm very glad I did. Its well polished, kills time, has a rather interesting story to it and its lots of fun. Would recommend."
947,Frosty4217,"January 6, 2016",5," This game can be intense, puzzling and collective. This game lasted a reasonable time and had a great story behind it and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars."
948,John Headley,"July 25, 2015",5,"Possibly the best game on Android Visually stunning, great story, great game play, and generally awesome all around. It's challenging in some aspects but still easy enough and very fun to play. Probably my favorite android game!"
949,Ismael Sebastian Perez,"July 23, 2015",4,"Finally decided to purchase! Been looking at this game for awhile and finally decided to get it. I'm genuinely surprised. It's just a fun platformer with a good pace to it. Not to fast and not to slow, with simple enough controls."
950,Tom Cavins,"December 10, 2014",5,"Amazing Playing on my nexus 6. Looks incredible, super fun platformer. 5 bucks is a steal. I would have paid ten for this game."

952,Dia do Chá,"November 25, 2015",4,"The game is very good but... I can't control the sounds of the game. I like the sounds but I don't like the background sound, I can't turn it off without turning everything off."

1056,Mohit Nautiyal,"August 10, 2016",5,"Awesome! But Just wow! What a game. But hey, what were you thinking when you designed the rules for hardcore. All stages without dying? How many people do you think will ever be able to do that, apart from a few of your game testers, if any."

Well worth it. In response to the one star Musselwhite comment about closing the game... It's not obvious but actually well done: you have to swipe from the right edge to get the home,  back and applications buttons. If you are on a phone with no physical home button, you can be at a loss if you don't know how to access these functions as you are used to in other apps."

4747,Anthony Escobedo,"July 15, 2014",5,One of the best games ever Definitely deserves five stars. The graphics are amazing and the story is exciting. I love solving the puzzles and racing around as a giant puff ball! I did notice the background glitches on certain areas. Other than that its perfect :-)

However, the charm hides a darker side: dank, mechanical underground puzzles shift the feel of the game to a more depressing tone, but not enough to change your overall impression of the game. It's sweet, fun, and very unique. The physics are functional and the puzzles are approachable without being too easy. In short: enjoy!"
4749,Mike Tran,"July 12, 2014",5,"Among the best I rarely pay for games, and my gut feeling was right on Leo's Fortune. Superbly smooth controls, beautiful graphics, fun voice for Leo, and really, that trailer! The effort these devs put into their trailer is indicative of the hard work they put into this game. Watch it, buy it, enjoy!"

We play on the HP Slate21 (desktop size tablet) and have tons of fun exploring Leo's saga. Our 6 yr/old finds it challenging but comes back time & time again to succeed. (YouTube level cheats help out!) The soundtrack makes for a calm backdrop, and the game-play encourages (demands) pauses and the use of timing so that speed is not always favorable. Worth the 5 bucks."
4751,Jerry Woods,"July 26, 2014",5,Awesome! Really impressive game. Very worth the price! Was a little worried about buying a $5 app but the ratings were high and I am glad I took the chance! *side note* Game was a tad sluggish until I switched to button controls. Now smooth gameplay with no issues.

At this price, it's never going to match console platformers for length, but what you do get is good value for money. As well as being well presented and quite funny, it also provides a decent challenge. And if you suck at platform games as much as I do, you'll be glad to know it's very forgiving when it comes to putting you back in the game when you die; you won't find yourself right at the start of the level or anything like that.   There are also no in-app purchases, so pay once and you get the whole game. No micro-transaction rip-offs here.   Oh, and it's compatible with the Moga Pro Power (in HID mode) and probably other controllers, so you don't have to rely on touch controls."
4753,Jon Pyne,"September 14, 2014",5,"Great game, no IAP rubbish A lovely little game that will have you ripping your hair out at times. Don't give in! Don't throw your phone under a train! It is all possible. And no in-app purchase crap. Support this developer!"

What sets it apart, besides the lush graphics and fun (but not annoying) sound effects, is the system for controlling your character on screen. Most games are over simplified or major fails, this game is the exception. While it is definitely easier to play on a tablet, even the screen on my Samsung S4 mini is totally adequate, and Leo's Fortune is fun in short bursts on the bus & longer sessions on the plane."

Not too long but good variety, and lots of replayability as I've enjoyed getting the extra stars. The game has a surprisingly good little story, too."
4756,Sean Ellis,"October 16, 2014",5,"Great game, but kind of short Game looks amazing visually, perferms well, and has an actual story line. Challenging problem and puzzle solving. I was able to beat all levels relatively quickly though. Unless you strive for all stars and accomplishments it will be short lived"

Nevertheless there is gamepad support, which no doubt enhances the experience even further for those with the option. The game itself is highly enjoyable, with well designed levels and gorgeous visuals. It runs super smoothly without overworking my device unnecessarily, so seems well optimised. Well worth the £2.99 asking price."
4758,Bobby Jones,"August 24, 2014",5,"Great story, great game play I couldn't put this game down. The story, the graphics, the voice acting, everything is engaging.

I VERY rarely pay for any apps on my device, let alone a game and I never pay more then $2. That being said, however, after playing this game I think it's easily worth $15 - $20. The graphics are not only beautiful but creative and well thought out. The game play is flawless (practically unheard of on a touch screen game). The user hints dropped by the main character are perfect. This game stacks up against the big dogs for the consoles. This developer deserves all the praise possible because they have done the impossible. Please for the love of God keep making games, I will buy them all!"

4817,Shane Walsh,"July 22, 2014",4,"Nice platformer A very nice platformer. I've only played the first level but I have a feeling things are going to get very difficult! The scenery is beautifully done, also and the physics work a charm."
4818,Tyler Seale,"July 13, 2014",5,"Best game in a while Leo's Fortune has it all.  High production values, challenging puzzles, great graphics and well done voice acting. Anybody on the fence should definitely pull the trigger. This is the best Android game so far for 2014."

The story is there for those who want it, but not constantly interrupting gameplay for those who dont. It looks beautiful and unique, and has plenty of different areas to go through.

Also i think its almost impossible to finish a stage with a 3 stars because 1st its really diffucult to not die  atleast once in a stage. Also the 3rd star "" time finish"" is almost impossible, i tried my best in many stages but still the best score i got was approx 1 min more than whats needed to get the star. Thanks"

5036,Luke Passantino,"July 16, 2014",3,"Solid, but nothing exceptional. Once you get past the gorgeous graphics and high production values you are left with a fairly conventional platformer.

The default touch controls (which I used for my playthrough) work well enough but are imprecise. Which can very quickly cause frustration when you are trying to achieve a three star rating on the levels. The game is also entirely too short for its price. I have no qualms paying for premium games, I much prefer it over the horrible freemium model, but this left me feeling a bit ripped off."

6368,Solal Bauer,"July 11, 2014",5,"Love it! This game is really well designed, and the storyline is great too. The character is cute and delightful and the challenges are set at just the right level to be hard but not annoying. Would recommend to everyone."
6369,Montadhar Al-shaya,"July 27, 2015",5,I can't describe this game Great story great gameplay plz add a dlc or just update the game add more levels this game just deserve 1m$ whatever you do I'll support your work
6370,Brian Morales,"February 21, 2015",1,Waste of money Its really boring and dumb. They should make it free because it sucks.
6371,A Google user,"May 17, 2017",3, The game is simply one of the best games that I have every played. But the app constantly crashes on the Moto G5 running Android 7.0 Nougat
6372,Vyas Chady,"August 23, 2015",3,"I bought it can't download. I downloaded much bigger games very quickly, it reached 7% both times and I get an error and it stopped. Then I had to download another big app and it downloaded fine, then tried Leos again and again 7℅ took ages and stopped again, tried 4 times. I guess I will try again later."
6373,A Google user,"January 21, 2015",5," Everything about the game is awesome. Got me stick to my phone for days, so addictive. Graphics, story, various challenges and easy of controlling is superb. No in app purchases, forcing you to pay in order to finish the game. Here you pay only once and enjoy ad free game."
6374,Sean Fishlock,"December 24, 2014",4,"Nice graphics, innovative gameplay Can get a little repetitive.  Would give 5 stars if Unmechanical want such a better platformer puzzler."
6375,J Kelly,"May 13, 2015",4,Great but short Easy to beat. Even the last level.... Flew through the game in less than a week.  The only knock was how short it is.
6376,Setyo Budi Utomo,"June 8, 2017",5," Graphic and gameplay is amazing. But i have some problem with the control. Sometimes i get lost control for leo's moving. But, for all its great game. Please make new sequel for this game"

6378,Alex Semine,"July 13, 2014",5,"I don't normally pay for content But when I do, it's amazing. After playing the cracked version, I gotta say, it made me want to make this donation to the team. Fantastic job!"
6379,A B,"August 12, 2015",1,"Error 905 & now error 194 Wow you have chewed up over a gig of data from me trying to download this.

Tried the 905 error fix now getti g 194..this is almost funny if it wasnt so hopeless."
6380,Andrés Felipe Pabón Luna,"July 28, 2015",3," I bought this due to recommendations from several trustworthy sources. My reaction to it, though, was rather ""meh"". It's got a very nice graphic design, and it can be funny at times; but the gameplay is just run of the mill. Not bad, just very, very average."
6381,dhiraj wadhwani,"December 31, 2014",1,Download keeps pausing Can't play because download keeps pausing at the same point... Pls fix!
6382,Philip Lucas,"May 25, 2015",2,Boooriiing. The graphics are nice but the gameplay has frack-all to do with the story. Its like they made a side scroller then copy and pasted a moustache on the blob character and made up some extensive unrelated backstory to make the game appear like it is worth spending money on.
6383,Dav Clark,"August 2, 2015",4,"Sonic reboot Decent, though I lost interest at a certain point when jumps became too fussy. That kind of thing's not as fun on a touch screen!"
6384,Scott,"September 21, 2014",5,short but sweet It looks and plays great on my tablet and it was very fun. My frustration playing this game was surprisingly enjoyable. I hope a “Leo's Fortune 2” is in the works.
6385,Xafe Mode,"July 16, 2014",3,"Its way to short The game is realy short, and the jumps in difficulty are outrageous,  I died over 3 times as many time on the final level as I did on any other level, I do not feel it was worth my 5 dollars. The gameplay was hood and innovative,  but i beat it in like 4 hours, and it has almost no replay value."
6386,to delete,"April 1, 2015",1,"Simply Overpriced I am not going to pay £4 for a game which has less gameplay than that of free ones. The mechanics are terrible, over used and overly simple"
6387,Candy Royalle,"September 2, 2017",5, One of the best games I ever played. In fact probably my favourite! It makes other games feel so second rate. Make another one!
6388,Alex Turpin,"July 20, 2014",4,"Cool game Cool game, love the graffics. Kids enjoyed it too. Kept us giggling. Marked down a star because its over priced for what it is"
6389,Kent Jeppesen,"January 18, 2015",1,"Kills my battery The game is only OK but it won't shut down properly on my phone, I would have to restart my phone every time I played it otherwise it would kill my battery in a few hours. I ended up uninstalling for that reason."
6390,Madeleine Pearl,"December 26, 2014",1,"Won't play keeps crashing This game looks great,it looks beautiful and the little story intro plays through just fine,but then it crashes after the intro and tutorial bit and never gets to actual gameplay"
6391,Zeenat Benjamin,"January 7, 2015",4," Great game, but drains the battery like anything. Also, it randomly starts playing the game sounds in the middle of the night, WHICH is really creepy."
6392,William Macuch,"September 23, 2014",4,"Great Visuals, Good Gameplay, Too Short The game looks gorgeous and plays quite well. However, it benefits in no way from touch controls and a controller would make it way easier. It's fairly short and only offers replay-ability if you're interested in speed running."
6393,Jeff King,"July 15, 2014",5,Very charming and playable platformer Great production values draw you in but don't get in the way of a very well designed game with a hint of Sonic. Simple puzzles are also part of the mix so its not just about mastering the physics of manipulating Leo. Lovely game that is worthy of your time and money.
6394,Jorge Valencia,"January 4, 2015",5,It's awesome! Played it on my sister's tablet and I instantly fell in love. Great story and game play.

The game is buteful (if you have a phone or tablet that can support the amazing graphics like the s4, s5 m8, nexus5, nexus7, htc one. all big flagship phones) the story line is really good. In my experience I would recommend ANYONE this game! It's super fun and I hope too see a 2nd one."
