App is updated, but still get the same message. Google tells me it my router, and the devices have to be closer. I can set the device right next to the router and still get the same message. Troubleshooting help from Google has never helped either."

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the home app and factory reset the smart clock several times but it can't seem to connect. There really isn't any trouble shooting information I can't find.

Chromecast is been there for a while now and it's one of the basic need for the users and I didn't find any setting. Please add this feature ASAP, if this feature is there I will change to 5 🌟. If it is already there ease let me know how to just cast only the video but not the audio. Thanks in advance. On April 25th: I didn't get any useful information with the link provided by Google."

It just needs to stay on the wifi i set & my chromecast needs a reliable plug for the power cord. Just design a tini latch. A 10 year old can do it, but i've seed Google Home app drive people completely crazy, attempt to uninstall google & toss the home speaker back in the box. Tip. If it doesn't find your device go to settings & try to ""remove devices"" from the home then delete saved wifi. Start again"

This app feels as bad as it did over a year ago - which closely mimics Google home in general. The only meaningful updates I ever see to the Google home experience these days are when voice recognition for various commands breaks for a week or so. What is going on Google?"
6,Frank Catrine,"April 24, 2020",2," No grouping, cannot create rooms, difficult to use. It took me 2 minutes to set up a light group with Ana, on Alexa. With Google home there is no option.

Also, every single audio group should be saved in a file listing sound and sync settings per device. That way when I cast to ""Home Audio"" it might be a little more lively, and when I cast to ""Bedroom Audio"" the defaults might be subtle. The fact that all of this equipment only seems to use the last known sound level is mind-blowingly dumb for smart gear."
11,Bill Perez,"April 25, 2020",1, Can't find a way to mirror my tablet or phone screens. won't connect to either of my chrome cast devices. before was nice and easy when I use the Chromecast app now I can't use the Chromecast devices I have which I've had for many years so now I can't return them or use them.
12,Ajith Mohan,"April 25, 2020",2," It would be nice to change ok/hey google detection to something else. It's bothersome to say hey google everytime you want to change the music or volume etc. It's a bothersome phrase for repeated ""frequent"" use. Something simpler would do better."
13,Donny Fernando,"April 24, 2020",1," I think the developer team should fix this major issue about the disconnected device. I have google mini nest and now it keeps disconnected, i tried to reboot all the devices, the apps as well, and now i couldn't even set the speaker. Please fix it ASAP"
14,Coletane Lopez,"April 22, 2020",3," These days my Google Nest Mini, have really been annoying me. I feel like throwing it out the window. It doesn't do what I asked for, or it, or even if I asked to play a certain song on music apps. Not happy about ball these days with this AT ALL!!"
15,Edwin Rivera,"April 24, 2020",5," Overall has been great. For once, I can project most things on my phone it's awesome. On the other hand there are movies on other videos on YouTube that are not projected on the tv."
16,Loz B,"April 24, 2020",2, Chromecast now not working on this app since last update. Doesn't even recognise it exists. Otherwise it's ok but the whole 'home' and 'rooms' thing is poorly planned and more confusing than just having a list.
17,Jaman,"April 25, 2020",1, The interface is unintuitive and adding new devices usually doesn't work. It's a joke how this is a multi billion dollar company's best attempt at synchronizing devices in a home.
18,Steve Chapman,"April 23, 2020",2, Speaker groups are flakey as hell. Woe betide you if you try to Bluetooth output from a Google home speaker to another better speaker as you'll only get popping sounds and broken audio. It's been like that for almost 2 years without any signs of a fix.
19,Rachel Galea,"April 26, 2020",1, The screen mirroring stopped functioning altogether. I reset the app. It seems like the function has been removed. Looking at other reviews with the same issue.
20,druid,"April 25, 2020",3, Did you guys pushout an update to Chromecast? Suddenly my TV won't pay the sound. The video can be seen but the audio come from my phone. Was perfectly fine till last night. What did you guys do?
21,Don Woodley,"April 24, 2020",1," After last update lights & smart plugs are coming up as offline even if I uninstall & reinstall through kasa to google home they still won't work on mobile. Wife hasn't done latest update yet, it still works ok on her mobile."
22,The Budder King,"April 22, 2020",1, Very IMPORTANT application that is always glitchy. Should be a huge focus of Google resources if they are selling us smart devices. I shouldn't have to click in the app for half an hour to HOPEFULLY make changes to a Max speaker.
23,ryleek burgess,"April 23, 2020",1, App is a hit or miss it works the first time and after that nothing. I have many Google devices that I can't sync with the app or use for example Netflix or Spotify because they aren't visible on the Google home app.
24,Mario Santos,"April 23, 2020",1," Garbage. Why does Google make you download an extra app to connect your Chromecast? Just make the option available on a web browser instead of forcing people to download another app. And even then, it's a nightmare to setup."
25,Dana Swaney,"April 23, 2020",2," I don't understand why it is so difficult to add a device to different piece of Equipment. Also it only allows me to add one device not 2, a example Garage Door 1 but not Garage 2. I have found this with my cameras also"
26,"Vermithrax, Dracarys","April 26, 2020",3, The instructions for changing the assistants voice is great to bad there is absolutely no way to change it. Other than that I have no problem with this app

28,Robert Hansen,"April 22, 2020",4, I've had issues trying to configure certain items to this app. I have two Chromecast devices and I had a hard time configuring II Chromecast so anyway I don't know how much longer I'm going to use this app.

34,Boss Boots,"April 23, 2020",4, I love this app it seems like every thing I buy that's Bluetooth or smart whatever can be linked to Google home and then I can do a whole bunch more things. Everything becomes 10x's better once I link it to Google home mind blowing 🤯🤯🤯💯💯💯

Would have been useful if frequent commands were in the main screen of the app as shortcuts. I stead, the way it is now, I have to click on the mic, wait till it initializes, and then tap it. Very inefficient. Another problem is, routines are only voice activated. You can't use a timer as it's trigger. Due to those issues, I use this app only to turn off TV and cast my screen. Other than that, I don't find the app useful."

Sometimes features I enjoy and get used to are removed without replacement or notice. In particular the ability to play youtube videos over audio devices or speaker groups was removed suddenly, presumably this is to force you to use youtube music, which unfortunately doesn't have the content that youtube has. They also don't allow you to use your home speakers as surround sound for your Chromecast, so you would have to buy some other set of speakers for that. I would also like multiple speakers to access the same schedule, instead of different alarms bound to individual speakers, and they aren't bound to a calendar like I would expect. Imagine having to roam around your house trying to figure out which one has the alarm you set, and hoping that another speaker doesn't hear you ask and decide to take precedence."

Googles developers are failing us dramatically guys and girls. The graphical user interface on the Google Home app is horrendous. At a glance without knowing any better you probably think that its cool until a friend comes along pulls out his phone and shows you his official Amazon Echo app, then it quickly dawns on you just how bad our Google Home app is. The day you have a play about on the official Amazon smart home app you will quickly realise just how easy it is to navigate and how unbelievably easy it is to configure and setup everything. The day you have a play about with it you can straight away tell that either Google has been neglecting us for some time or Amazon has been doing everything right like listening to its community, and acting on feedback. I can only assume after using the Amazon smart home app that Amazons developers stem from a home automation background because their app is spot on. Aside from the shoddy interface on this Google Home app, it often seems like Googles Google Home developers are often tampering with something on the back end on their servers, because all us Google Home users ever seem to get from Google AI is "" I can't reach this device, that device or another right now "", even though you devices are still fully functional via their corresponding manufacturers apps, meaning they still have full physical network connectivity and communications with the internet."

545,Lee Thomas,"April 16, 2020",5, Bought this to connect my Disney app... But likely to use for many things. Was very very easy to plug in and set up. Ethernet port on the plug is good touch keeping cable down and tidy
546,Loren Witzel,"February 21, 2020",1, Rebooting doesn't help. Home group no longer works. Device control randomly drops devices and it is impossible to add them back. Speakers can't be controlled from the app. It gets worse every day. Nobody listens to feedback. Junk.
547,Jaelynn Plummer,"February 24, 2020",1," I don't understand why it is so hard to locate the MAC address when my phone is already connected to the google home mini. I need the MAC address to be able to use the wifi at school, so I can't say this has been a helpful experience 😂"
548,A Google user,"March 7, 2020",1," This app is worthless and confusing, every time I change my wifi password I have to use this app to reset my chromecast and there is no easy easy to do that, the app is confusing and not straight forward at all and im not computer illiterate."
549,Reese,"March 26, 2020",1, It's pretty glitchy with Spotify. And if someone else in the house has Bluetooth then they can take over whatever device you have connected... I'm not sure how but it gets pretty irritating. Also the app is oversimplified and doesn't show tasks that are happening
550,Cheri,"March 28, 2020",1, I bought a new Chromecast and I cannot connect to it at all no matter what I try. I've always had a good experience with these devices up until now. Until they fix the bugs dont try to use this app.
551,Mr Toad,"April 1, 2020",2, You updated it and now its less user friendly. The main screen is baffling to look at and navigate. Had to look up how to screen mirror as I couldnt find the option.
552,Cheyenne Oliveira,"April 5, 2020",1, My Chromecast device just stopped working on my TV. I've already tried everything and nothing seems to work. I couldn't get any help from the assistance.

558,Eric Williams,"February 20, 2020",1," Won't cast nest camera to Chromecast. They're on the same WiFi and Google account. UPDATE: None of Google's suggestions work. The error states to use the same as it's listed, which doesn't work either."

562,Katie Martin,"March 6, 2020",4," This app is pretty simple until you get yourself mixed up, but that was my fault. I just don't know why we have to download the Google home and Google WiFi. And the speeds are out of this world. Thanks to you. Google."
563,Emmett Jennings,"March 6, 2020",1, Absolutely useless app. Since when is a home a room and vice versa!? Most confusing instructions of any app I've installed. Alexa identified the device I attempted to activate within seconds. The Google home mini was a Christmas present. I wish I had re-gifted it!
564,Jay Petacat,"March 13, 2020",3," Basic functionality is okay. It does not support Android's dark theme, which is jarring in a dark room. I'd also like to have the ability to add switches for devices to my home screen."
565,Muddy Gupps,"March 22, 2020",1, To many hours wasted. Im buying regular old alarm clock. Should not have to use wifi. I have plenty of Data. Should be bluetooth compatible or be able to set up via wifi hotspot. Very disapointed and a big waste of time and money. I dont even want to leave one star honestly.
566,breeding pool,"March 23, 2020",3, Overall it's pretty ok. But my favorite thing is when I wanna make a device group then its says that it cant communicate with google and to wait a few moments then after I wait a few moments and try over and over again it still doesnt work. Absolutley love it:)
567,Robert Stauffer,"March 24, 2020",1, Control (play/paise) of any app through Chromecast no longer works. Since you have to use your phone to control Chromecast it essentially makes it unusable. I guess I'll be looking at purchasing an iPhone and Apple TV in the future.
568,Ray Acker,"March 25, 2020",5," Great app, works as described. I wish it was a little more powerful though. I'm a network engineer and work like to have a little more info listed. Maybe an advanced tab?"
569,Yvonne Stockwell,"March 29, 2020",1, I have tried to get help with disconnecting my AP isolation. There is not info on website that I have found. I have been on hold with Direct TV for 1 hour so far hoping they can help.

573,travis carver,"April 15, 2020",1, I have to delete the app and reinstall every time i need to use it. It consistently forgets my device i need it for. Its an absolute shame because its a very useful app when it works.
574,Danny McManus,"April 20, 2020",1, It doesn't let you put the subtitles (for Deaf viewers) on TV when casting from the phone... Can you please fix this issue. Thanks.
575,Jenelle Love,"April 22, 2020",1, Horrible connection issues and unable to cast my screen anymore with any of my accounts. It's been an ongoing battle so finally just bought a new TV. Will NEVER use this app again
576,tokyo joe,"March 24, 2020",3," the recent update stopped my ability to say ""turn off"" when music is playing. now it's hit and miss with ""turn off radio"" and ""turn off alarms"". sometimes I'm told it cannot reach Philips Hue so I have to repeat it."
577,loolyou 1,"April 15, 2020",1," It's a really bad app and device, just wasted 200 riyals on stupid garage. Doesn't work at all. What a wast of time and money. Unrecommended to buy."
578,Robert Greenhouse,"February 21, 2020",3, I don't like pretexted questions and answers. It's like it doesn't want to answer anything outside of those questions. Nothing about setting Pandora as default song player! Can't copy your link to paste in browser.
579,Ethan Eu,"February 22, 2020",1," Using my pixel XL phone, can't link services because no web page is displayed, only the faded out screen which keeps on waiting forever.

I wasted 2 hours on this yesterday. Another today I follow the directions but you u say to do, is not on my phone. Also Why do you want personal information? What does that have to do with mirroring my phone. In Europe they changed the laws, google & facebook have to pay them for the info. That will never happen here, too easy to pay off DC."
582,Timothy Sweeney,"March 17, 2020",3," It works I good, but hard to set up, needs easier ways to link devices, and if you need a better help area, alot of options that can go wrong which left me trying to figure out what went wrong with my device."
583,Natalie Jones,"March 17, 2020",2," Cannot get my google to connect with my smart light. I have two and the basement google is fine. The upstairs one cannot locate the smart bulb.

584,Kareem D,"March 25, 2020",4, The app is nice but definitely could be better. Needs more options for customizating with harmony hub remotes. Getting routines to run smoothly with custom commands can be tricky sometimes. Overall an easy app to use.
585,Victoria Margaret,"April 2, 2020",5, Confusing at first glance but once you look through what it offers becomes second nature. Have it linked to my chromecast and display advertisments on a tv for potential customers to see.
586,Omar Arevalo,"April 5, 2020",3," Works but app design is not appealing. Looks outdated and bland. Google doesn't appear to have much interest in their smart home department, thinking about switching to the other smart home voice assistant."
587,Mark Fainshtein,"April 9, 2020",2, Not intuitive at all. Go learn from homekit or alexa. I use it for few years now and still have a hard time to find things.
588,Jaylee Figueroa,"April 14, 2020",5, So so I have a Google homebig TV and I used it on this app and it's super easy and super fun and so you can just watch anything you want Netflix Disney plusand YouTube it's so fun and creative and it's so just amazing and I liked it so much
589,Johannes Bader,"April 22, 2020",1, Only use it because chromcast isnt working properly and i have to open this App then it works (sometimes) Controling lights works so bad that its easier to just flip the lightswitch yourself.
590,Miss Rich,"April 20, 2020",1, App is saying that it recognizes my device but it won't cast to my screen from my phone or my laptop. It doesn't even show up as an option to select anymore.
591,C Johnson,"April 19, 2020",3," I'm still not able to use all Next devices using the Home app. The older devices, eg, Next Thermostat works with home, but the Yale lock only works on the Nest app"
592,Raphael Rars,"April 18, 2020",1, Really terrible. Got a hub max and simple requests like play a specific playlist or calling someone causes crashes... even the call volume is terrible. Not worth the money.
593,"Guy Zandler BSN, RN","February 28, 2020",2, I have asked it for certain songs. Some songs work and others just go to other songs. I would also like to cast Netflix or Hulu from my phone or cast YouTube videos. To this point I just get a black screen and only get the audio.
594,hussain abdullah,"March 8, 2020",2," Glitchy, I've been trying to add my duo but it never seems to work. Additionally I cannot even teach it to recognize my voice it just tries to connect to wifi and says no devices found. Can you guys help me?"
595,Brett Govero,"March 20, 2020",5," Most convenient multimedia device/app I've ever owned. Seamlessly switch between rooms while playing the same song... Sync 3 speakers together at once.. (Home, Chromecast, Nest) It has made life easier whenever it comes to picking songs out and making timers and lists."
596,Mark Johnstone,"March 29, 2020",4," Pretty good, except for: no dark mode, no way to tell from the main screen if something is currently on (fan, heater etc.), no widgets."
597,Karen M Bellamy,"March 31, 2020",1, Very difficult to setup Google Nest Mini. The application continuously requires you to start each step over. The damn device is next to the phone and it keeps restating please install Google home. Whereas Google home is preinstalled.
598,Sonny Morales,"April 2, 2020",5, It is an enjoyable ability to be able to use the casting feature. Very useful tool. Especially for educational purposes. Thank you Google.

600,Guillaume Morat,"April 11, 2020",4," Pretty decent app overall, do the job, nice design and UI. One minor complaint : for my Xiaomi camera there is no On / Off button on the app even though I can do it by voice. Please add such buttons"

606,Douglas Giere,"March 1, 2020",4," It's great! It would be awesome to see a setting for your lights that you could change the scene/theme of them from this app, instead of having to rely on the main device app."
607,Rompas Stell,"February 20, 2020",2, App assumed which Google account to use and now i can't even get it to see the Chromecast. I have used Chromecast in multiple households and never had a problem until I was forced to use this stupid app. Huzzah technology.
608,Not Yourbusiness,"February 22, 2020",1," I really hate this device, part of the problem is my android account which I made a gmail for and forgot the password for and the amount of obstacles google is putting me through to reset both the chromecast device and my phone are ridiculous."
609,Swanand Wagh,"March 3, 2020",1, The app is no good. I am not able to update the password on my chromcast. Nothing is user friendly with this app. Very badly created app. I am a computer science professional and I can't get my chromecast updated with new password.
610,Владимир Юхименко,"March 7, 2020",4," Using Chromecast 2 - it's ok and very easy to setup for te first time.

611,Ismail Muda,"March 14, 2020",1, Very bad connection with TV after 1 year using chromecast. Only the first year very good. Google give lifetime warranty. But only after one year keep having problems. Need to reset chrome cast to factory reset then only can use again.

621,Sina T,"March 21, 2020",2, For all the amazing things the Google Home and Assistant ecosystem offers it still amazed me that in 2020 we do not have Group Video casting. We have group audio casting but not group video casting. I've been asking for this for about 3 years. Come-on!

624,Antony Brophy,"March 12, 2020",5, I love this app. It helps me out all my smart devices onto one app and then since it goes through Google I can use my Google assistant to control them. I really love it. One bummer is that a few streaming platforms can't be controlled or linked
625,Gael Le Sann,"March 16, 2020",1, Terrible! Every once in a while it stops working. My chromecast device is 3 years old and is always the same. It just stops working and i have to spend hours trying to fix it. Are you not supporting it anymore????

627,Glenn Bathgate,"March 30, 2020",4, Good app. Could have more features and the ability to view a current streaming service and perform all functions not just play and pause.
628,Nadine Richardson,"April 6, 2020",1, It was working until now I reset my Google home mini and I tried to set it up again it popped up but when I pressed yes to set it up it didn't do anything the only thing I could do is press skip
629,George Cappuccio,"April 8, 2020",3, Works fine except for giving anyone else on the network control of your Chromecast. Need to be able to turn this off.
630,Jane Woodward,"April 8, 2020",4, Easy to use app. A must have with a chrome cast. Just wish the control to fast forward was a 30 second increment button rather than a slide scale.

650,Peter Saunders,"March 27, 2020",1, Google seems to have distanced themselves from this product. They are no longer offering any support and appear to not be intelligent enough to be able to fix the problems that so many people are experiencing with Chromecast.
651,Randy Dutch,"March 20, 2020",2, March 20th. I reboot my internet service and i reset my chromecast still nothing.

654,Tony Cook,"March 12, 2020",1," I can't configure my chromecast, it refuses to switch the WiFi to the chromecast configuration node and eventually just times out. Since this is all I want from it, it's a complete failure"
655,Christopher Brei,"March 15, 2020",4, Its a good app and does well connecting different smart devices into one location. The the options for each device and the capabilities home offers could vastly be better. Smart lights have a huge rsnge kf festires home and assistsnt cant touch. Alexa has googme beat ten fold because of this
656,David Turinetti,"March 29, 2020",2, I continue to use this out of necessity. Still no dark mode and the UI is still surprisingly clunky and not as intuitive as I've come to expect from other Google/Alphabet apps/services.

672,Me Ki,"March 4, 2020",3," Great tracking app. No way one can get rid of ""keep you activity"", minimal option is 3 month. The choice ""don't keep"" is just not present. 3 month converts to 3 stars)) As they say here: It could be worst!"

704,Benji Zorella,"March 18, 2020",3, This app has the potential to be amaaaaazing but falls short. Where are the long hold quick gestures? Where are the widgets to control every aspect of my phone rather than going into the app? 5 stars for both those options.

848,Babs,"March 1, 2020",4, It's pretty easy to use. But it doesn't find devices without you actually having to set them up. Also it'd be nice to know what they support and it's hard to link other home hubs together
849,Jean Kinkaid,"March 8, 2020",2, Unfortunately it falls over at the first hurdle. I use a Chromebook and whilst it will install and generally run OK there's messages popping up saying I can't install Assistant on this 4 month old Chromebook. So how do I get Assistant to run and finalise the setup?

855,Tim Charron,"March 11, 2020",1, This is probably a fine app if there were any useful instructions how to use it. All it ever does is play Ritchie Havens music on my living room speakers.
856,Andromeda Jones,"March 18, 2020",5," Can control all of my mini homes, I can even control my Spotify from my Fitbit while playing on the homes. This helps me choose where in the house to play music. Links most of our smart technology to my phone."

858,Jon Lough,"March 22, 2020",1, Would be cool if my phone connected to it without all the stars lining up. I can connect about 10 percent of the time with no rhyme or reason. Could just be my phone though.
859,Bilge Karuc,"March 20, 2020",1, App doesn't complate chromcast setup also there ia no option to link the devices I already setup but deleted from room. It's very bad and not user friendly. Google is f**d up this time. It's vey annoying.

875,Samuel Tomelty,"April 24, 2020",1, Terrible. Have a latest model Chromecast pro and a 2019 galaxy tab and it has stopped casting with this app. Are Google releasing their own line of tabs and they're bombing the competition? Or is there a new Chromecast device coming out? Either way screw you

913,Nick Zahorchak,"March 18, 2020",2, Rarely understands basic commands. Gives no assistance in helping user understand what commands it needs to understand. Stops operating devices on a whim. All issues are blamed on the connected devices not on Home lacking adaptability or capable learning.
914,Nathan Sergent,"March 22, 2020",5, I love home and all its facilities. Shame there isn't widget access on my pixel 2 though. I could do with that rapid access to functionality for lights etc. Is it just old pixel phones that don't have this or is it something pixel phones could do with across the board?

Since I originally set this routine, I have added several bulbs. Any time I add the new bulbs, I go into the routine and add an action to the new bulb(s), and then save the routine, all with no issues. Recently, I added several bulbs and wanted to incorporate them with this routine. As I went in and set them to turn off during the bedtime routine the app is telling me that my changes couldn't be saved and to try again. I thought it may be because of the new bulbs so I took them out of the routine but it still won't save the routine. I even tried removing all of the actions from the routine and it still gives me the same error message. I have no idea what to do at this point and am very frustrated with the whole situation."

I have 4 Chromecast audio devices in my home and have made 3 groups. When I try to change the volume a first time, it works well, but when I open the app again to quickly change the volume of a certain Chromecast device or group, it takes a lot of time to connect to the device, or the app just freezes and I need to forcefully kill it and restart it. Then it works again (for a short time) until I switch my screen off. Also when you're in the detail view of a group, to adjust the volume of just one speaker in the group, it works the first time. But once the phone has been in sleep mode (screen off for a while) and you switch on the screen again, moving the sliders of individual speakers have no effect any more, until you switch back to the group, wait some seconds so the app reconnects to the Chromecast and tap the ""individual volumes"" button again. This problem is not phone or home related as it exists on all my phones (all Samsung Galaxies but different models and Android versions). Also tested it in two different homes. So I'm sure it's app or os related. Must be something with Standby that cuts the wifi connection I suppose.

I used to do the mirror by tapping the icon at the right bottom corner, but this icon disappears after the new update in November 2019. Now this Home app becomes useless for me. Further to my above query, I spent a few hours of tapping around the new version of Home app. By patience and luck, I have found the way to mirror my Samsung tab screen to tv. It takes four steps/taps after opening the Home app. After connection, the mirroring work as well as the old version. So my review, after wasting a few hours of my busy time, is: The Chrome mirroring a tablet screen to television work well if you know how to connect it. However, the user instructions/guidelines are lacking, no where to be found (for this simple turning on, it takes 4 steps/taps, can you imagine it); In this respect, the new version of Google Home is not user friendly. It would worth 5 stars if the developer could be more customer considerate."

There's just one snafu that stops me from rating it 5 stars: the alarm. The Spotify-paired alarm is by far my most-used feature. I use it to wake up to songs I like every day.

It serves me well and does everything I expected it to do based on their television commercials. I will say two things. First, my home, like many homes, does not have a low voltage doorbell so the concept of using the existing doorbell wiring was not available. Instead, I purchased a small transformer (you know the small black cubes that plug into the wall and have a long small cord) and used that to power my nest. It was perfect. Second, Google needs to make a PIP type app for smart TVs and for computer monitors so we can see what is happening at the door. The only way I can see the Nest camera view is by my cell phone or by a lot of switching sources nonsense on my TV. I do not have the option, at all, when working on my computer."

I use this a lot on Alexa and since very basic component of all computing I did not even think to check if supported. Come on Google make this available! Thank you for response.. Once the feature is added I will update my review and will be able to recommend it over Alexa. Until then I unfortunately can not."

Initially seemed to work fine, and I added/linked to other apps Hue, Arlo etc. It didn't put everything in the correct rooms, but that wasn't difficult to sortout. The Ability to use the one app to control different systems was great, I no longer had to remember which device was in which app. Since then the App is beginning to get annoying. If you want say just one light on in a room it's multiple pages to navigate to. The Camera link works sometimes but not always, so I still end up going to the native apps. HOWEVER, the worst part since the first install is it will not update devices from the linked system. Add a light bulb to Hue, or a smart plug to any other 'linked' system, and then Google Home will not update and include that device/light or whatever. Move or rename a device and you have to update it in native apps and Google Home."

The problem is after updating the software i can no longer do it. The update broke it. After casting my screen the tv goes dark and gives chromecast errors saying the connection has ended."
2952,Scott Fowler,"December 17, 2019",1, Recent update is awful. I used to just be able to say play my sleep playlist and it would work perfectly. Now it's 'ok here are some songs' that have nothing to do with anything. It doesn't see my library anymore. It won't work no matter what I try and it's super annoying.

3355,X Beckstead,"February 5, 2020",1, the app doesn't allow you to add your TV to speaker group. The problem is probably because Google needs to update the cast app for the tv. A work around is AirAudio but your phone will need to be rooted.

3359,Tech Support,"November 8, 2019",1, Global snooze button not available for one of my accounts and support can't figure out why. No technical people to resolve. Also the latest version hides the trash icon in the menu so it's very difficult to delete videos quickly! 3 or 4 clicks per video. Bad design!
3360,Joseph Labrada,"November 19, 2019",4, Sometimes frustrating and sometimes everything goes smoothly what's most annoying is when Google says I'm still learning and you know that's a lie because they don't update the CPU so you get a lot of I can't help you with that or I'm still learning.

Occasional issues with controlling devices, casting device media, and missing some helpful tools. I really, REALLY wish you could set your Chromecast video's output to a cast-enabled speaker (at least Google Homes).

Doing so did not help. I am about to try factory resetting my Nest Router and then deleting and recreating my Home."
3368,Justin Espagnol,"February 20, 2020",4, Good app. Could be a little more user friendly or provide some first user tips/suggestions on how to set up your home. Dark mode would be great!
3369,Chip Brush,"December 13, 2019",4, Works pretty well. I am having to spend more time fixing/repairing my current config and bridges between hubs to control devices and routines than I'd thought. Things break occasionally and are harder to troubleshoot and repair than should be necessary.
3370,Josh Fox,"December 17, 2019",1," Hardly works.. Never understands and resets after being in for a few minutes... Newest update had ruined everything. When I ask it to play what I usually play for music, it has totally changed and doesn't play the right stuff.... I'm throwing it away and switching to Alexa.... Thanks for NOTHING!!!"
3371,Andrew Nelson,"December 20, 2019",1, For a product pushed so hard by Google you would this it would work flawlessly at this point. Customizing a a routine is full of bugs. Click one option two others change. Using the home app to cast to others speakers it constantly looses connection and volume and play options are lost.
3372,Jorge Rivera,"December 31, 2019",4, The interface is pretty good. Can get a bit cluttered at times and hard to find exactly what you are looking for in terms of deeper settings. For the majority though everything is presented nicely on the main tab. I can control all my Assistant enabled devices easily.

3374,Sabrina L,"January 2, 2020",3," Works great, HOWEVER, I can't seem to get Netflix to cast either on Hub or Chomecast... Web searches and forums suggest I should be able to??? currently only able to do it with Hulu, Disney+, Spotify, etc. Everything but Netflix? What is the problem?"
3375,Nathan James,"December 19, 2019",2," Great, except that so much of the time, it doesn't understand simple commands, and you've got to either repeat them multiple times, or say it I Dionne long winded way that's shower than walking over and picking up the tennis for the device you're trying to control."
3376,Kevin D,"December 25, 2019",4," Works decently. I have noticed that the more devices you have on a wifi signal (phones, PC's, tablets, wall plugs, Alexa's, etc) the more likely the app will not be able to connect to Chromecast devices. Still a good app though."
3377,Samie,"December 27, 2019",5," I really love how easily accessible things are with this app, but suddenly it stopped reading my device (light) so I unlinked the device and tried to link it back up n Google keeps crashing and preventing it...

3379,D Blatnik,"December 21, 2019",4," The new version of the app needs work. Okay. After uninstalling and reinstalling... It works. The migration feature from my old phone (also Android) didn't work quite right. Something needs work, it just isn't only this app."
3380,James Luciano,"January 1, 2020",1," Many buttons in the app do nothing when I click them. Reinstalls don't help. Tried using my friend's Iphone 6, more setting worked but I couldn't connect to my xbox. A talking speaker is kinda useless, even if it was free, just because this app is horrendous and doesn't work."
3381,T S,"December 29, 2019",1, One big mess. Groups of lights don't work. Can't remove linked devices. Bunch of ghost devices linger around and can't do anything with them. Each device should have a clear option to delete it. Where do you create and remove groups.
3382,Edwin Chikhani,"January 1, 2020",1, No proper support for issues related to device connectivity and feature settings. Users are left at their own Demise to configure the application and its connections and features. Google support is very poor in that regards. I am returning back my speakers.
3383,Lydia McCord,"January 7, 2020",5," It helps me find out things quickly. I just wish it was more personable. I wish I could say ""thank you google"" instead of ""google thank you"" idk its silly but yea. I love how it knows exactly what your telling it to do when you search for things to play or to watch."
3384,Sharyn George,"January 7, 2020",3, It is lacking some basic support. When asked to add items to my shopping list it often creates 2 items instead of 1. i.e. garlic aioli dressing. garlic is added and aioli dressing is added instead of the 1 item as requested. I have tried asking in different ways without success.
3385,Shuburn,"January 11, 2020",2," I agree with a lot of the criticism here. Personally... linking to LG ThinQ doesn't work, lots of people have this problem. If the devs can't be bothered with fixing communications with 3rd party apps, then I see no reason giving Home a higher rating. Please solve this!"
3386,Aaron H,"January 10, 2020",3, Most of the time I am unable to cast audio from this app to my devices. They are all connected and visible. It says my device may not be compatible for casting. I'm using a pixel 4 and a Google account. How much more compatible can I get?
3387,Jeff,"January 22, 2020",2," The app works well, however if I'm going to be turning lights off at bedtime, it would be very nice to have a dark version so I'm not blinded as soon as the app is the only light source in the room. Dark version, skins or themes will earn 5 stars."
3388,Bree Bennett,"January 21, 2020",1," Great, but quirky. The latest issue I had is that the ""call home"" button that allows a person to call a home speaker or Nest from their phone and is supposed to be available in the app is nowhere to be found. Please help!"

3409,Julie Brandon,"November 23, 2019",2, Google Home/Nest Speaker Groups seems to have broken rather badly in this update. Old groups don't work. Can create new one but they don't work either and most of the time they don't show up in the app or quickly disappear. No amount of rebooting phones or speakers or clearing app data fixes it.

3411,John Averill,"December 8, 2019",2, Screen casting now sucks. It's like google have made it as hard as possible to simply screen your device. Back in the day you would just click the top left menu and then cast screen. Everytime I try now it's an absolute mission getting it going.

Why is night mode not supported within this app? When you are watching a movie at night and want to adjust the volume of your chromecast you are blasted with the white screen 4. Maybe it is just me but the layers upon layers of menus and settings for this app is frustrating at times, it seems overly complicated compared to Android OS settings menu. For example, I have 3 smart lights in my living room, it took me forever to find out that when I click on my living room lights, I have to then click on the room name again to then adjust the individual lights, too many layers of settings within this app for a company that has done such and outstanding job with settings on Chrome Browser, Android OS, gmail etc."

3622,Rick Dugger,"January 2, 2020",1," Thanks for disabling my lights. I can't wait for a good self hosted assistant to come out.

3628,Colin Kawaguchi Cecil,"January 6, 2020",1," Very buggy, unintuitive design, set up makes very little sense, and has to be repeated about once a month or everything stops working. Setting up multiple rooms in one home is basically impossible to get functional."

It appears to me instead of paying a thousand more dollars on five or six other products, I might just have to get rid of my entire setup to get Amazon products."

And, if I can post information to a Google Sheet using my voice, should I not also be able to connect the Google Sheet to do a mail-merge function with my voice as well? And, if I can do all that with my Google Home device and a Google Sheet, should I not also be able to incorporate a LinkedIn API key code and get content uploaded into LinkedIn Groups - all initiated by speaking to a Google Home device that runs a Google Sheet?

3764,Soumitra Banerjee,"December 13, 2019",3, It's not very logical and takes a while to figure things out. Doesn't look like I can add routine to turn certain lights on. It seems routines are mainly to play music or TV.

3769,Zuri Alexandria Jernigan,"January 12, 2020",3, I love the app overall but it is very random on how easy it is for me to connect to my chromecast. My internet connection is fine but sometimes it just doesn't have the option to cast.

3846,Ivan Vallee,"November 25, 2019",3," My home speaker disconnected from internet after many months and to re-connect through the app following logic has been painful. Still no success, Try later. Followed Google assistance and rebooted WiFi then reconnected through App."
3847,Michael Garcia,"November 26, 2019",3, Does a lot well like operate and be compatible with a lot of smart things. But still not that intuitive and things it seems to recognize to use with routines it doesn't. Love all the voices though.
3848,Lanny KIM,"November 24, 2019",5," Best part, is the continuous software aided improvement on existing devices. Google Home has never been prettier and convenient especially with Chromecast. Yet to try other devices but already consumed by the simplicity and hands free and high definition services of Chromecast."

3850,glenn smit,"December 4, 2019",5," Absolutely awesome app easy to use, compatible with all my bulbs including hue bridge, can set timers and much more with my Google home mini and scheduled music/ lights etc I recommend this app for 100 % functionality and 100% ease of use too."
3851,Brett Bristow,"December 7, 2019",4, Over the years to Google Home app has seen major improvements. The most recent update fixed many bugs but I would still like to see improvements in navigation and functionality & quick access to Google Assistant settings.
3852,Jeff Hortian,"December 5, 2019",5," Finally A Native App, I put in feedback like a year ago in regards to wanting native apps like iOS does. I'm glad to see Google has taken feedback in regards to developing native apps such as this. I would highly recommend so far it seems very useful."
3853,Ndee Jim,"December 10, 2019",3," Too bad that playing on multiple speakers require you to define speaker groups. While I walk from room to room, I'd simply like the speaker in that room to what I was already listening to."
3854,Morene McNulty,"December 13, 2019",2, Could be so much better. Things work sporadically. When they work it is great. When none or part of the lights turn off or won't turn on it loses its pricey usefulness.
3855,Steven Puccini,"December 16, 2019",1," Constant issues with any device not made by Google, even the GE bulbs that come Google Home ready don't connect to the app, the moment I connected a Home mini I had to factory reset all my existing ""smart"" devices and re install them."
3856,YManCyberDude,"December 29, 2019",1, The only things it can seem to do is tell you the time & weather. Anything else it refers you to provide more info in the app with no real way or option of doing that. Nothing of what I've seen of Alexa. Kinda useless.
3857,Wanda Smith,"December 25, 2019",5, Google home keeps getting better and better. Being able to use different devices with voice control is so helpful. having an easy and quick set up is so appreciated.
3858,Alexandra Amico,"December 31, 2019",4," Good. Enjoying asking basics like weather, alarms, play music etc. Although I can't change music directly from the Spotify app or Pandora app. I have to use the Google home app and am limited to either verbal or minor controls on the app."
3859,Matthew Smith,"December 31, 2019",3," App has few functions, and the instructions are unclear and cover few relevant subjects. The speakers can do a few basic functions. Outside of doing basic internet searches I would not recommend it."
3860,Chris C,"December 25, 2019",5," Only issue is that I have two emails, and only one email has subscriptions linked. Apparently i can only connect one email to my nest device.

3863,Vic Ochoa,"December 23, 2019",5," The app does what it suppose to do. It is very straightforward and easy to use. The items basically connect to the app by themselves. It is not complicated, just follow a few basic instructions and everything gets connected. Simple!"
3864,Deb Matresky,"January 7, 2020",4," I like the app well enough just wish you could delete things or change things more easily. Just a button saying delete or maybe rename, maybe there is and I haven't found it Other than that it works fine for our home."
3865,AC Williams,"January 12, 2020",5," Ever since i got the app, I could listen to the music i enjoy, and change the things that play on the tv. I just wish the added disney plus to mini so i could change that, but other then that, this app and product is amazing"
3866,Sierra Smith,"January 13, 2020",1," More than half of the buttons within the app are unclickable. I cannot click the button to connect my roku, I cannot click the button to manage the accounts I have connected to my Google home mini. This app sucks."
3867,Meghna S,"January 24, 2020",1," There are no WiFi settings available in this stupid app. So everytime I move house, I am not able to connect my Google home mini to a new WiFi and the only solution is to reinstall the app from scratch. Absolutely terrible"
3868,Oisín Flynn,"January 25, 2020",3," Decent but urgently needs an option to do routines based on dawn and dusk times! What's the point in having light ""automation"" when you constantly have to manually alter when the light comes on!"

3887,Jin Young You,"November 13, 2019",3, Routinely glitchy. Doesn't work when it should. No amount of troubleshooting works until it does. Just have to be patient while tech improves but for money you invest the wasted time grates.

3891,Lurocks 1970,"November 21, 2019",1, You have to connect to location to use device? You can use the software to pair bluetooth with device.

3894,Martin Rogalski,"November 25, 2019",1, If i could leave less stars I would. Screen mirroring doesn't work 99% of the time. So infuriating. Other apps can find device but Google home can't for its own Google product. And no in not doing anything wrong Such a simple thing and you guys truly f##ked it.
3895,Mitzi Rivers Singleton,"November 30, 2019",4, Overall I enjoy this device but when I ask it to connect to my phone it says it cannot and give me information or disconnect at any given time I sincerely hope that you will fix this issue that I have thank you
3896,Stephen Feyrer,"December 8, 2019",1, Very disappointing. This experience is so poor that it can only be described as a sales pitch for 🍎. Could not send to Chromecast Audio from my phone library or play Audiable audio books. Complete waste of time and unusable.
3897,Amul Kumar,"December 8, 2019",3," Poor/nonexistent security management tools. Cannot control Chrome tabs playing ""supported"" websites like Netflix. Voice activated messaging is incredibly dysfunctional due to the number of contacts that I have."
3898,Matt Napoli,"December 21, 2019",3, They make it impossible to move devices so it makes you delete your account and re-setup everything. It has an option to move devices but its broken. It's been an ongoing problem since July but still haven't figured it out.

This is why I have refused to offer advice here, because I'm being a real bastard. Apologies. I did rate this very highly though. And yes, this app had a dramatic, positive and lasting impact on my life by curing my stupidity and redirecting my cancer into my saliva so I can spit it out. This app was in English, the one true language and didn't have disruptive ads. The app has a special place in my heart, ok"
3901,OddsFiche Official,"December 22, 2019",1, It was working just fine. Now it doesn't recognize anything. Pretty useless now. I've tried everything to reconnect it with my phone to the Chromecast and nothing.

3910,Tom Wright,"January 13, 2020",3," Good and bad I find it confusing , but I usually get it to work. Google should make some YouTube videos on this, and more on the theory of how it works, so people can work with it an not against it."
3911,Rachel Ni Dhubhghaill,"January 10, 2020",3, Still working out inconsistencies. Sometimes it opens automatically when chromecast is on and sometimes not. Sometimes I can rewind on my phone as well as volume change and sometimes only volume change appears.
3912,Sean,"January 19, 2020",2, This app used to conglomerate all the media you had coming into your phone very neatly and in an easy to use way. It also acted as a great Chromecast remote. It stopped doing all of that at some point.
3913,N R,"January 31, 2020",1, I keep having trouble with this app. it'll cast one image and then nothing else works.

3936,Alfredo Granado,"November 26, 2019",1, This os an clear demonstration of how fragmented Google is. Nothing works fine. Google is great to make things more complicated than should be. Google assistant is a meh and Google home is just not ready yet.

3942,Liamm Scribbins,"January 4, 2020",5, It is cool because you can ask it what the weather is like and it already knows location. You can ask it all sorts of things like to play your fave songs. You also can ask it intresting questions and it answers with a intresting and long answer

3974,Craig Snelling,"November 16, 2019",3," Generally a nice platform when everything syncs up. My issue is that my TV keeps discinnecting even though the app indicates it's still synced. So really good when working, some recent issues."
3975,John Wibrow,"November 22, 2019",1," no longer able to access BBC iplayer, itv player ect, now a useless app. The Google home app no longer has a means of accessing the above apps. I can cast by accessing the apps directly and cast to my TV."
3976,Jeff Kumanga,"November 24, 2019",1," This was a 4-star app just a few months ago. Recently, it can't recognize what I'm saying, changes its own settings, deletes programmed commands, and just hangs for no reason after being given a command. What happened Google?"

3981,Sarah Myers,"December 2, 2019",1, What should be a smooth set up isn't. The Google mesh says it knows I have multiple wifi points but will only establish connection with one. Set up won't work either in this app. Won't go back without completely leaving the setup.
3982,Edsel Hall,"December 8, 2019",2," The app keeps disconnecting from the speakers in both rooms. And it's a hassle to link the TV. It works then it doesn't. When it does work, it's a great app."

3984,nikhil Singoori,"December 10, 2019",5, App is good. But I want to just suggest that as future is completely IOT so why cant work on update such that our room appliances can be controlled according to whether condition by this app since we can control our appliances by same app and google home.

4002,Leo Coyle,"January 23, 2020",2, Does what is needed (eventually) but I found that setting up my google home device using a chromebook and this app was more than a little frustrating- it takes several attempts to get it to recognise a wifi router.

4086,John Davis,"December 30, 2019",5, Bought one. Now have 4. One in each important room. It's like having live Wikipedia and with Spotify it's just wonderful. I kind of wish that all the different ones would work together. That's very unlikely.
4087,Jack Hansen,"December 28, 2019",4, Generally useful and bug-free. My only minor complaint is the interface can sometimes be a little counter-intuitive - navigation of settings for individual Home products can be sometimes fiddly. Great app though aside from this.
4088,J Jay,"December 29, 2019",4, Had a few glitches where it wasn't doing anything nor responding properly. Had to unplug it to get it to work properly. Other then that I love my Google home. Awesome xmas gift.

4091,PerryJames,"January 16, 2020",2, It understands commands about 45% of the time. I can never delete old roommates it can tell the difference between myself and my boyfriend. It answers to everyone the minis crash often etc
4092,vivi.,"January 24, 2020",3, Overall very good but for some unknown reason news play after an alarm rings. I did not set this up and it stresses me out. Please fix this problem. Thank you.
4093,Christopher Marek,"January 27, 2020",4," It's good, it works as advertised. Would be great if they'd stop dropping useful features.. but, I guess that's tandem to asking Google to stop breathing."
4094,Carina Moreland,"February 1, 2020",2," To change wifi networks is impossible. When you actually Google how to change it, the directions aren't accurate"
4095,Kerry Copper,"January 29, 2020",4," Great app, could do with a few tweeks in the routine area but all in all, does it thing"

4104,David English,"January 17, 2020",1, This app is a joke.. Having 10 of these devices in my home and no matter what you do 1 or 2 of them are always offline or something stupid... The app seems to be designed around having 1 or 2 units max...
4105,Blair Kissel,"December 26, 2019",1, My Google Home Minis keep showing as unavailable. I have factory reset the mini and reinstalled the home app multiple times but it always shows as unavailable. This app is buggy and rarely connects properly to my devices.

4109,Monica Murphy,"November 3, 2019",1, This app used to be pretty user friendly. It seems like with every update this app gets worse and worse. Everytime it updates I have to delete and re-add my chromecast... E V E R Y T I M E !

4115,chris pascual,"November 20, 2019",2," Don't know who's to blame, i cant cast any resolution lower than 1080p on my chromecast. Why google didn't include this option? Yeah highres is good but not for us folks with data limits."

4118,Eric Pieters,"November 24, 2019",4," This app is giving you the basic controls of all your devices in an easy overview. Also from here you can setup your Google mini so you can make your devices smart! Good job Google! You want to make speaker groups, here you can do it!"
4119,Trennis Dumas,"November 28, 2019",5," I don't know how long I've had this device in my drawer, but I couldn't stream on my old roku devices a new channel that I wanted and this works even better."
4120,Nick,"December 1, 2019",1," For such an incredible product, your app is the most confusing useless thing that I know of. Google devices have no clue what is what where they are or who they are talking to."

4127,Greg Moritz,"December 22, 2019",2, I can't log out when I need to. Integrating Nest with Google Home after migration is a nightmare. What do they say about 'if it ain't broke'?
4128,Jacob Andersen,"December 21, 2019",5, My family loves our Google home. We have an Alexa in our vacation home and it never understands exactly what we're trying to say like Google does. I don't know why Google doesn't out sell Alexa 10 to 1.

4132,Tiffany Lyles,"December 25, 2019",5, Is that is a brilliant design and unbelievably resourceful. I really enjoy using it and simple to use and understand. Couldn't imagine my life without it before. How did I ever live before. Thank you to the designers and whomever had the brilliant idea to do so.
4133,Jerry Woodard,"January 1, 2020",5, This is work seamless for me. All lights thermostat cameras Google Home speaker Chromecast all sync well together. All is on the same network and I have repeaters throughout the house. Excellent app.
4134,Jakob S. B. Kristensen,"December 22, 2019",2," I only use one Chromecast in one room, so miss the simplicity of the older versions of chromecast. Home has only made it more difficult to use it for me (and I experience much more connection issues than before)."
4135,Kc Cassidy,"December 28, 2019",2, the only thing I use this for is weather and it can't get the accurate forecast. There was a snow storm that everyone knew was coming except my Google home that said it would just be flurries instead of the 1-4 inches that is actually expected
4136,Lloyd Cameron-Lewis,"January 2, 2020",2, It's extraordinary for the simple things it won't do. While the screen Google Home hub allows me to have a convo via my nest doorbell the mini's won't. I understand Ring/Alexa are way more developed.
4137,Cynthia Yvonne,"December 27, 2019",1, Thanks for the reply but I have uninstalled and reinstalled this app a few times. I have also rebooted my chromecast device. Still getting the message to dpwnload the app but my phone recognizes it as installed.
4138,Corey Decareau,"January 7, 2020",3," Works well for the most part. It randomly disconnects from my phone while changing songs, so until that's fixed I'm giving it three stars."
4139,Jessie huck,"January 7, 2020",5, It's nice to have one app to control all IOT devices. And I have a lot. Also you can provide input and control your Google assistant. This app works well and is evolving all the time.
4140,tassaron muffin,"January 8, 2020",4, It's improved a lot over the years! Just needs a few more options (better routine management for instance) and support for dark mode.
4141,Tommye Mayer,"January 9, 2020",1," Underwhelmed. I find no simple way to proctively add deviced, like a smart lightbulb. GoogleHome should let me search for smart devices. The way I do with bluetooth. I widhGoogle Home were bluetooth enabled. It's a wa-[ay more user-friendly medium"
4142,Edward Palomo,"January 12, 2020",2, Unintuitive and full of glitches. Linking accounts takes multiple attempts and fails far too often. Combined with the lack of support from Google themselves I'm left wondering if I choose to back the wrong smart home system.
4143,Crim313,"January 8, 2020",1, Doesn't work. Won't let me click on option to add equipment to it when it says I can. Have followed every step on the support page without any help from Google.
4144,Terry La Tunguley,"January 14, 2020",5," Simple and easy to use yes, but I clearly see room for some improvements! There should be a few more standard options to operate your connected Google devices. AAAAA++++-"
4145,Jacob Morales,"January 16, 2020",4, Great functionality! Just wish there were more practical applications. This seems to be for business and silicon valley types. Need more google search capabilities for college students like myself.

4162,Burt Dalton,"November 7, 2019",2, How do I add a room? Google has always been very user friendly but every time it updraft it gets worse until they get the bugs out months later. Google is slowly becoming another Microsoft noooooo please go back to simplicity and user friendlyness
4163,Cory Clifford,"November 17, 2019",3," I have a good amount of google devices, including nest. I don't care much that I have to switch between the two apps to get the full capability of the nest products.

4166,James Hammes,"November 22, 2019",5, It was working great then all of a sudden routines disappeared Now when I say the keyword it takes me to the Internet. Due to an update to google assistant it now works great! Thanks
4167,Kerry Taylor,"November 23, 2019",2," The app constantly updates. When ph detects an update, chrome cast cant connect. This is pathetic considering it should run chrome.cast regardless of updates. Too many updates! Every week nearly."
4168,Nikki McNamara,"December 3, 2019",3," Changing my rating after recent changes made groups and routines using the 'adjust lights etc' now broken. A workaround is to set up routines using each step command,but it is obviously a step by step fix and not seamless operation."
4169,Travis Whiteley,"November 29, 2019",1," Confusing, not at all user friendly. Assumes what's best in our home instead of letting me decide what i want or don't want. My son has a Google home that I don't use but because I'm on the same wifi if I say hey Google to my phone his speaker answers. I don't want connected to his speaker!"
4170,Alex Kulakov,"December 7, 2019",1," Works very inconsistently. Speaker groups frequently missing. Media screen shows nothing is playing, while it's not. Play Music constantly loses connection with Chromecast speaker. Etc etc"

4174,Babu Vignesh,"December 15, 2019",1, Screen mirroring functionality has bug with microphone permissions since two years but no fix done till today. Unless there is a resolution control for screencast feature we are not able to use it in India with daily data
4175,Joseph Haim,"December 13, 2019",1, Why cant I remove a device or services. Everytime I tree to unlink it wont let me. Cant even add new services anymore. Unreal how difficult and tedious it is to get help from google. There is no customer service
4176,Angal Life,"December 13, 2019",5," This app is amazing! You can say ""Hey Google turn off the lights and it does so. You done have to do anything for yourself just ask something to Google and BAM! it does so"

Too bad that there isn't smth to replace it."
4181,Linda Russell,"December 29, 2019",4, The signal/icon to cast is intermittent. Even after turning off the phone the signal/icon reappears only intermittently. The chromecast is clearly connected and ready on the television.
4182,Steven Hardcastle,"December 25, 2019",4, Really good for having all your smart home devices in one place. It can be a little tricky with the multiple sub-setting's to work out and only gives you basic control over most things.
4183,James R. Brayshaw,"December 29, 2019",4," Mostly used for fun questions, weather updates, some music play and a few phone calls. The Assistant doesn't hear us 100%of the time."

4188,Jamie Pollard,"February 1, 2020",3, Not a nice experience. Everything seems difficult and I can never find what I want. There seems to be a million menus and I never know if I'm in the right one for what I am looking for so I just give up and use another service for what I want to do.

4218,Brent Crenshaw,"November 23, 2019",3, It should be a great app but there are parts that are so frustrating. Some home app don't connect (heos didn't work forever). Some things won't go into rooms correctly. Needs work.

4223,Michael Zudyk,"December 2, 2019",2, I use this app to cast my phone to my nvidia shield. The dev's keep changing how the home app casts to my device. Every time it takes me a week to figure it out. This sux so hard!
4224,Holly Weitze,"December 3, 2019",3," Mostly good. Half the time there is a glitch when I open this app that immediately closes it down and it takes a while to get it to open back up. Other than that, works well."
4225,Shubhang,"December 8, 2019",2," The location on my Nest mini device doesn't seem to get updated despite updating the location in the settings. Tried restarting the device and all. I did try reinstalling the app as well, doesn't work"

4229,Josh Scott,"December 24, 2019",4, I enjoy google as an assistant. I have also used Alexa as well. I enjoy google more but the Home app seems more complicated then the Alexa app. I really think the google app could improve.
4230,Lakisha S,"December 28, 2019",4, Its It's not bad but it does lag or abruptly stops the current program from streaming . And if Google does see this pls don't ask if I upgrade the app because I did and it still does what I described above. Thanks.

4236,Daniel Learmonth,"December 30, 2019",4," Could do with more in-depth control over things, as well as easier access to automations, but generally very good and reliable."
4237,Lynn Voglmaier,"December 31, 2019",2, Works great when it works. But most days it does not see speakers and or groups. Very frustrating. Get it right google!
4238,Mike McGill,"December 25, 2019",4," Really enjoying my experience with this app. Ran into the odd glitch, which seems to work out in revisions. I do miss chromecast audio and the powersupply with wired ethernet cable. Please bring back chromecast audio."
4239,Caledoz,"January 5, 2020",4, Could not communicate with your Google home mini. It worked fine before the update now it's useless. Udate: It is now working but I had to factory reset and re install.
4240,Matt Fries,"December 28, 2019",5," I have the nest thermostat, nest wifi, home max and google mini. This app is a perfect companion for all the devices. Never any issues connecting to any of the devices and a lot easier than checking each individual app."
4241,Czausaun Jones,"December 29, 2019",4, The app is great with Google Services and products (chromecast and YouTube specifically). I haven't had much success with using 3rd party devices and my assistant (smart bulb).
4242,Tommy Miller,"January 13, 2020",2, Right now I am having great difficulty in moving a Google mini from my main room downstairs to my bedroom upstairs. The app doesn't even recognize it and I am getting very very frustrated.
4243,Aron Sutopo,"January 13, 2020",4, Great app! Use this daily basis exceptionally the routines. However it now starts to use other routines which I never set up and it never uses my own routines anymore. Really annoying
4244,David,"January 13, 2020",4," Really good but, like many Google apps, some settings are hard to locate. As others have mentioned, removal of option to reset Chromecast is a step backwards."
4245,Michael Keleher,"January 8, 2020",1," Frustrating to no end, extremely user unfriendly. Dictatorial, and lacks decent instructions. Too many options, adding app can take up 4 to 10 times before successful, if you are lucky. Fascism at it worst!!!"
4246,Rich T,"January 10, 2020",3," It would be better if it had fast forward capabilities. It has a rewind 30 seconds when casting a video, it would be nice to go forward 30 seconds."
4247,Mike,"January 13, 2020",3," Love this app but when oh when am I going to be able to sync my Google Calendar, and set alarms/reminders from my phone or tablet? Come on Google, get your finger out 😙"
4248,THAKSHAN RAY,"January 18, 2020",2, 1 . Quality of the video sharing should improve 2 . Led full screen is not appearing 3 . Sharing range should increase ( connectivity ) 4 . Mobile Screen off option while playing video needed

4250,Aarti Dingore,"January 21, 2020",1, The application says that it cannot connect to the internet even when you have a stable connection. Couldn't do anything further as the app couldn't connect to the internet...

Why can't Assistant interact with Google's own major products like Gmail, or Search?! If you're neutering it because you're so concerned with having a smooth pre-vetted experience, why do half of the videos in my top stories have nothing to do with the headline, but seem to just be whatever video some news site happened to have on the same page as an article? Seems to be Google's MO: great tech with inexplicable unforced errors!"

4275,Simon Greer,"November 23, 2019",3, Quite disappointing. Device order is set by the app alphabetically and makes it painful to access frequently used rooms/devices. Update: Some more improvement..device notification can be used to open device to control media at last!
4276,margie troy,"November 15, 2019",2," This is so difficult to figure out. There are way too many times that I'm told ""I'm sorry, I don't know how to do that"".

Main negative is the clunky interface for individual lights where there is a brightness setting and a separate colour setting. If a colour is set, the brightness seems irrelevant as it seems you can change the intensity of the light with the colour but it only works with white light. There is also no settings for scheduling or rotating through colours like the Lenovo software has."
4281,Carlos Gonzalez,"December 6, 2019",1," Frustrating experience, not connecting to Google home, so practically useless. Not sure if it's the app or the piece of junk of ""smart"" speaker that keeps having issues and glitches and have to hard reset it every week"
4282,Weegie Marie Vaughn,"December 29, 2019",3, It seems system would be more sophisticated and knowledgeable. Be able to distinguish certain wirds such as should and when. Jut certain very minute things. I'm often disappointed with reply and ability of system.

4285,Michael Renninger,"December 29, 2019",4, This app is making progress but the Google home needs to add few more features... 1 is a timer option to turn off or on lights. (Ie turn off light in 30 minutes. )
