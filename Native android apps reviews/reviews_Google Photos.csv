And also the best part is, it gives you a flash back of years ago with cute titles. But one thing I didn't like that there's no privacy to hide the photos, anybody can excess the photos and videos without any lock. Any which ways the app is awesome."

Sometimes I take a picture with my phone, then going to the Google photos and cannot find the very last picture I took one moment ago. A very frustrating experience to even find a photo you literally just took, all while some photos from who the hell knows when are sitting right in front of you and you do not want to view. this app makes me want to smash my phone against the wall. 0 stars!"
2,Bob Corso,"April 20, 2020",3," A Great App but with sone major flaws. It forces all photos to be cataloged by date thus offering little flexibility in making albums.

It forces all photos to be cataloged by date thus offering little flexibility in making albums. I have had to change the dates on hundreds of photos to get them where I want them. There is also no way to 'collapse' timelines or albums, or create sub-catagories (like the email folders in gmail) therefore forcing you to scroll through hundreds of albums and thousands of pictures. It would be nice to have the location name on the photos much like Apple does."

I ran out of storage space (couldn't send or receive emails for a bit) and saw that the main thing using storage was this app. I deleted ~60% of my backed up photos (which I had to back up on a USB because Google automatically deletes photos off your devices too) and turned off sync. What do I see 2 weeks later? All my ""deleted"" photos are back and new photos are still being backed up despite me telling it not to. This is criminal."

It really is the best gallery I have ever used. My complaint is that you cannot do a mass download.

The app I had on my other phone was much better! Here are the main reasons: (1) The photos are not in ABC order in the album just randomly placed where you have to scroll all over to find it (2) The number of images you have in an album is not shown (3) When you export files from another source it doesn't keep the same name for most of them. Why? (4) You are not given the option of changing the name of the photo is you chose to. DITCH THE SCREEN MESSAGE! F- grade given!
6,Dax Talbert,"April 23, 2020",5," Love how intuitive Google Photos app is.

It takes all the monotonous organization like: option to fix pics orientation, will show you if you have duplicate pics, and you get more group&sort options than gallery or my files!). Google photo app will suggest the items previously listed and you decide whether or not you want to allow changes (sometime I think a pic looks better upside downüßêü§î). I didnt quite understand the high quality vs original resolution back up, but I'll continue reading."

Pictures also randomly upload into my cloud or categorize themselves, and I don't know how, when, or why, so when I want to see a particular pic, need to do some hunting.

Since the last 4 updates I can not always edit photos in the app. This is a serious issue for me as I use it frequently each day. The dreaded circle of death arrives when I press Save. The editing and saving processes are inconsistent and either freeze, slow down or fail to work. At other times they may work as designed. This is enormousley frustrating so i'm going to be examining other photo apps. Hoping to find a more consistently performing app."

If you go through Facebook, it's hard to find such an old picture, since everything is sorted by date. If you go through Google photos, it gives you can option to share directly to Facebook as a new post, but not as a profile picture. That's why there should be a option to ""promote"" pictures to most recent, so that they are easier to find."
10,Terasha Miller,"April 19, 2020",5," I love the fact that you can catagorize you pictures by the names of the person in them.

You're unable to select files, move them to selected folders and archive them in one go. You need to create your selection again after each action. Also, it's impossible to know if the photos in the main directory are saved in the albums, unless you open the albums themselves. As a photo management app it doesn't do the job. This app should be developed based on the great functionalities of the Gmail."

Whilst taking pictures somehow it can glitch and make the pictures corrupted and inaccessible. Not only this but I cannot delete said corrupted pictures for some reason or have to go to lengths to do so. I also second the shuffling of photos sometimes. Apart from those issues it's decent.

Perfect way to store and organize photos without any hassle by doing pretty much nothing outside of uploading them to cloud.

Take that as you may. There's a lot of other smart functions within the app. Video playback could be better."

Even after switching to my Razer Phone 2, I've continued to use this app consistently for years. Unfortunately, something appears to have gone wrong in one of the most recent updates. Albums simply do not save, nor do photos properly delete. I've tried to troubleshoot, but the only solution I've found is to revert the app to the factory version. The downside is, you're stuck with the 2000 file limit for albums."

395,Kitty K,"April 3, 2020",1, This is by far the worst set up I have ever had in a gallery. I have never had so many problems and complicated things in a gallery! I just want to open up my gallery and see my pictures not see them scattered around everywhere.
396,Sara Mendez,"April 20, 2020",5," Love google photos!! Some of my favorites include the videos, collages, and albums that are automatically created with pictures uploaded from my phone. I also like when memories pop up! This is a great app!!"
397,Rosa Wang,"April 18, 2020",5," So much storage, easy to share photos (you can make albums that multiple people can add to), facial recognition makes it so easy to find photos! Also fun stuff, like automatically making animations with photo bursts, and showing you photos from ""on this day 3 years ago""."
398,Carlos C,"April 17, 2020",5," So easy to use. I take a picture, then I can share it on any platform instantly. They are safely stored in the cloud. And they are easy to look for later. I can search by date, or place, by the names of the faces, or any tags I add. So Great, I Love It!"

400,Natasha Gerasimopoulos,"April 19, 2020",1, I think Google photos has gone down hill. I use to love it. Right when u went on u could select if you wanted comfortable view ECT.

401,Christine Gilbert,"April 5, 2020",5," As ""that person"" who typically had 9k photos taking up space on her phone for fear of not having quick access, I especially appreciate this app. It gives me peace of mind knowing all of my photos are automatically backed up and are easily accessible right next to the other Google Apps I use daily."
402,Sohan Mondal,"April 4, 2020",1," I have just updated my application and now I am unable to save the changes in my photos.

So Google Photos is absolutely exceptional."
414,Tera‚Ä¢Kyota,"April 24, 2020",3," This app has been alright until the recent update. I've noticed that none of my images are backing up (it only says that it's preparing to back up the photos). If this were fixed, the app would be better."

548,Tony _,"April 11, 2020",1," Needs improvement, can not remove photos from system albums like places, screenshots etc without deleting the photos. There should also be an easy way to encrypt and Hide photos. Archiving them is not good enough."
549,„ÅØ„Å™„Å≥–ΩŒ±Œ∑Œ±–≤i,"April 11, 2020",4," The app is great and saves me tons of space on my phone, the only thing I'd comment on is that if I scroll through my (much) older photos, they appear pixelated, blurry and just sit there loading."

556,Razvan Georgescu,"April 9, 2020",3," It is a good app. The only issue I have is that my Galaxy S10+ saves screenshots in DCIM/Screenshots folder and I can't exclude this folder from auto-backup. Also, deleting photos from google back-up also deletes photos from device and there is no option to change that."
557,Brian Bohlke,"April 17, 2020",5, Phenomenal. I have never had an issue gathering my photos and sorting them in any manner I would prefer. I love that you can share galleries and have a partner to share all of a certain person or persons photos too. All in all a wonderful application.

570,Kerry Dollak,"April 6, 2020",2," This app is not very user friendly. It asks me to archive photos, that I would much rather just delete, and there is no option to do that. If they are gone from my phone, than I want them gone in Google Photos. They are definitly not in sync with each other."
571,tony jones,"April 4, 2020",3, I find it hard to put pictures where I want them without them being in multiple different places. I have pictures I share with people and some I don't but besides archiving them they always end up in multiple places.

748,srinivasan v,"April 16, 2020",2, auto backup data limit should be increased from 30 mb to around at least 100mb or 150mb bcos one photo size is nearly 3-4mb ... only 10-12 photos can be backup up ... plz provide increase update ... thank you How-to know the total number of photos in my google photos ... !
749,Archishman Sarkar,"April 16, 2020",1," Worst experience....even after I checked the option of backup over cellular data, it says waiting for WiFi. At times it automatically backups over cellular data. This app just acts according to its will."
750,Lizzie Perez,"April 4, 2020",4," I lost photos once too many times thinking they had been ""automatically"" saved to my photos. It's a horrible feeling knowing those memories where never shaved or shared and are lost forever."
751,wesley quinn,"April 24, 2020",5, Super useful. However would request two things. 1. The ai to recognize comics/drawing and puts it in the groups of people/pets. 2. the ability to hide certain photos.
752,Queen Beautiful,"April 14, 2020",5," I üòç this app ! It's very user friendly and secure. It keeps you updated with every special feature., It allows you to share photos with whoever you choose üòä. All in all I'd say it's a must have."
753,Lauren Duchesne,"April 16, 2020",1," This new update is awful. It's hard to navigate and being that I use the pixel, my only real option. When I take a screenshot it doesn't even show up in the screenshot folder."
754,Bernadette Ferreira,"April 2, 2020",5," Sooo greatful for this app. Lost my phone,but luckily all my photos was backed up on Google Photos. Useful photo editing software also available in the app. User friendly interface. üíØ"
755,megha gupta,"April 17, 2020",1, Earlier I was able to delete pics from device memory. But after update if I am deleting pics from camera the same pics are getting deleted from the other folders as well. It's really annoying after update.

757,Ed Cleary,"April 4, 2020",5, Used it for years. Very handy to back up photos and to help clear space on my phone. It's so nice having all my photos from years ago in a place I can search.
758,Jorge Restrepo,"April 7, 2020",4," It's an excellent app, works good and useful. I will give my 5 stars if I can lock the pictures for each folder I mean for secure of the users when they are showing the pictures to their friends or people."

760,Francisco Mendez,"April 9, 2020",5, Updates on Google Photo app are constant and I appreciate their efforts. I have always counted on this app to keep my images and photos safe and they have always delivered the proper source to do so.
761,Joe Prentice,"April 11, 2020",2, Won't let me just pick and send. Above the picture it shows a picture I don't want to send. To send to 3 or 4 people have to create group and then delete because I won't probably send as a group again. Have to contact people to see if they got right photo.
762,Timothy Hamilton,"April 15, 2020",3," Great app, except for lacking view-only sharing , you can only share with editing permissions at this time. Microsoft's Onedrive allows for both types of sharing, which is more versatile"
763,Wesley Will,"April 17, 2020",1," I don't WANT all the Google automatic b.s. !! I just want to see the bloody freaking flipping pictures I take and store on MY DEVICE and not some ruddy security nightmare of a ""cloud."" I would rate it ZERO STARS if that was an option."

768,Zeeshan Rahat,"April 10, 2020",1," The photos sync with google cloud feature is sluggish and bugy (3/10 times) and when deleting lots of photos, it takes a while for the photos to go into bin, just freaking send those selected photos to bin instantly on phone and sync that data with google cloud later on."
769,Troy Blessing,"April 15, 2020",2, Bad update: Used to work fine but ever since the new update it drains the battery more than normal even when phone screen isn't on. Plus it won't load my cloud saved images when I reset the app....please fix
770,DemiThinks Simple,"April 12, 2020",5, I have had it for a very long time and it is just so helpful and useful! I love how organized it is. It separates camera roll from other things! It's really simple to use as well! 10/10 would reccomend.

773,Joseph Leocadio,"April 7, 2020",4, Google Photos is such a reliable app. Not too much fluff and the features are useful. I would suggest a more feature rich editing function as well as real video editing--free.
774,Carla Macasio,"April 24, 2020",3," Very useful to back up photos, but there should be an option to pause or cancel the upload after you start it without having to uninstall (then reinstall) the app again."
775,Rajeev Radhakrishnan Menon,"April 4, 2020",2," Extremely slow upload even though the internet has very good speed. This is in OnePlus 7, android 10. Past 4 hrs it is unable to upload a 400 mb file! Strange... This was not an issue earlier"
776,Sophia Morgan,"April 14, 2020",2, I have been deleting photos to ensure I do not pass the 15GB of storage given to me. It is a bit overwhelming to be getting so many emails about reaching storage limits.
777,Luddy Harrison,"April 1, 2020",5," Great app. No doubt this gives Google a wealth of image data, but the advantage of having photos so well backed up to the cloud is overwhelming."
778,Andy,"April 12, 2020",1, Photos not synchronizing losing photo memories that I'll never be able to get back. In general very disappointed with google lately. Not to mention google voice can't follow simple instructions anymore
779,Arcade On Drive,"April 11, 2020",5," Quite useful and helpful app. Saves lot of space on mobile. What I like about it the most is the smooth manner media is uplaoded online and we are informed about it, with the likely GB space that can be vacated on mobile. Five starer indeed."
780,Israel Casasola,"March 28, 2020",3," It needs to be available for Android TV. Watching my pictures on the big screen makes all the sense in the world. And, no, Chromecast isn't a good alternative."
781,Natalie Moore,"April 6, 2020",4," I loved the little videos Google makes using my photos, it's really clever. The edits of my pics aren't always great. they're usually too bright and the colour is off. But it's good to have that option"
782,Joseph Valentine,"April 7, 2020",5," It's a great app. Recently I upgraded to Android 10, after that it takes bit longer to delete photos using the app. Everything else works perfectly fine.. Please do fix the problem..."

784,SHROOMY,"April 4, 2020",1," The app is fine otherwise and does it's job, however it's inexcusable for there to only be one single order of organising photos, that being newest -> oldest. I should be able to organise my photos by filename, for instance."
785,Sai charan Devarapalli,"April 4, 2020",4," Very useful. If you have lost all your photos due to some reasons, this app brings back those photos. Only if you have accessed google photos when you have shot those your photos will be back by google photos. Thank you."
786,Steve Johannes,"April 6, 2020",1," All I can access is my recently added camera photos for when I want to share them on Facebook. There is no way of accessing my total gallery. Maybe not the fault of Google. If you are associated with Facebook, ALL your executives should die horrible, painful, and slow deaths!!!!!!!!!!!"

789,Sandra Martinez,"April 13, 2020",1, I used to LOVE this app. Sadly with the new updates something keeps going wrong!! It wont let me edit photos and it wont let me update people/pet albums. I hope it gets resolved fast.
790,River Braithwaite,"April 19, 2020",1," Getting worse and worse over the years as options are striped away. An increasing trend from Google, who in trying to make their apps 'moron safe' are making them totally useless to anyone else. Bindingly obvious functionality missing."
791,Ryan March,"April 20, 2020",5, I love this app. I have lost so many pictures on my old phones. Even pictures of my daughter's birth. So I love that I don't have to worry about my pictures.

792,Duncan Taylor,"April 22, 2020",2, Fine app but now backup an issue due to Google's 15gb limit - which when I signed up many moons ago was promised as unlimited. Sigh. App does what you want although tries to sell me picture books which is unhelpful.

800,Joel Bouchard,"March 31, 2020",2, Functionnality is good but I would like to be able to force a folder instead of looking in whole phone for photo. This makes impossible to manage photo by folder (and maybe hide some personnal documents).

862,Mark Herbert,"April 22, 2020",5, Great app and saved me a ton of storage on my phone. The recommendations they have in this app are impressive and is much better designed than my phones built-in gallery.
863,Sharon Taylor,"April 14, 2020",4, Very glad I can access my photos and use them for screen saver. Only thing I don't like is I have some identical and I would like to get rid of those that are alike.
864,Dr. Nidhi Maheshwari,"April 14, 2020",2, The photos are blurred... They are not clear at all.... And it may take more than a half hour to make one photo clear..... Everything is gud hereüëç but this bothered me.. üòè
865,Baban Gorai,"April 18, 2020",2," If I ejected SD Card, after mounting my photos are not showing which are already saved in my card . Google photos trying to loading the photos and backed up photos shows, which are already saved in my card."
866,Carolyn Normand,"April 24, 2020",1," It's rubbish. Most of the photos it wants to archive I want to bin, but there is no option to allow me to do that. Also I don't want it to have any stars for this, but I have to give it one!"
867,Marius Mihai,"April 8, 2020",3," Fairly good app, somewhat buggy in recognizing faces or editing photos (sometimes hangs while doing a simple edit) and, not lastly, draining alot of battery while keeping the power phone awake for apparently no reason"
868,Maynframe Outlaw,"April 10, 2020",4," Every time I check out this app, I am astonished at just how many pictures I have accumulated over the years! I would never have been able to keep track of all of them without this site."
869,Laura Morris,"April 12, 2020",5, I love watching my photos on my television. The only negative thing I could possibly say is I wish they would go through every picture before they start showing some twice
870,CW Stockly,"April 11, 2020",5, The easiest and best multifunctional photo app that also happens to be free. I could not have created a more satisfying set of solutions.
871,Noisu Wan,"March 28, 2020",3," Please add some features like fast forward and previous etc,when im watching movie in google photos it's hard to fast forward because it's only have pause and resume. Hope you will notice this :)))"

874,1st things First,"April 3, 2020",4, Just basically that the continuous options and suggestions even ideas shown to me opened my mind at times that it allowed me to use more creativity. And easy to manage.
875,Laura Smoley,"April 2, 2020",3," I was hoping that when it backed up my photos and then deleted them all from my phone without letting me choose which ones to delete, that it would at least retain my folder system and organization. Unfortunately it organized 2000 photos into a huge mess."
876,Akhilesh Rathiya,"April 3, 2020",2, One major probelm is that there is no privacy in sharing. Everyone can see if link was get to wrong people. Google must include that selected google account can see photos. By adding their account gmail address.
877,Kavita Pandey,"April 8, 2020",1, It is showing device photos as well so its difficult to delete photos from Google Photos only. Also when I delete photos from App it got deleted from device as well. Google photos should keep separate actions for App only.
878,Bulma Briefs,"April 18, 2020",4, The one thing I don't like is how the videos I have in my photos are low quality. Can the quality be updated to high quality to get a better look at my old videos?

883,A Google user,"April 5, 2020",5, I like the app on iOS version you run out of storage space fast and I like making videos with Google photos I can easily get all my photos from one place instead of installing Google photos on my iPad unlimited storage space
884,Shavon Morris,"March 31, 2020",5, This app is always been my go to. Photos r beautiful and if u have a photo that needs lighting fixed it does it for you among edits. And photos always backed up for space on devices.
885,Cari Cruse,"April 8, 2020",2," Where did the icon go that indicated each photo that's been backed up?? Stupid app continually shows ""1 item left"" but I don't know which one because you removed the backed up cloud indicator. Really frustrating."

890,Will Nolan,"April 6, 2020",1," App was great, now it's very slow and I can't select a pic from the motion pics. Everytime now it says, trouble exporting image. Now I have to spend time moving to Samsung pic app."

892,Pi,"April 9, 2020",1," The usefullness of this app has decreased for years, now it doesn't even seem to sync with my Pixel Slate... Why are all the google products seeming to not work well with each other anymore?"
893,Ibukunmi Adekunle,"April 22, 2020",1, My Google photos have been sending error messages on closing unexpectedly and have been unable to make use of it for Months now. My phone is Infinix note 5 I hope this can be fixed soon.

896,Gentjan Dida,"April 7, 2020",1, Photos don't upload from phone to storage. And if it does it uploads 5 photos a day. I am paying for 200gb and for last 3 years i used only 26 gb as photos don't upload. Speaking to their team not very helpful.
897,Harshita Narayan,"April 15, 2020",1," You've clearly given the option of making a movie, but I have tried like hunderd of times to make it work but there's always one item left. It never works."
898,Jennifer Wisooker,"April 16, 2020",5, Great!! Have had a few little issues with the app stopping or having errors when moving photos to different albums. But overall I love this app!
899,Krishna Roy,"April 5, 2020",4, Great app... But they can improve it by adding a vault feature in it to hide some personal photos or atlest by adding password feature in archived photos so that other cannot access anyone's archived photos...
900,Liz Grigorian,"April 17, 2020",2," New update is flawed. Anytime I try to edit or apply a filter, it just sits and thinks forever until I hit the back button."
901,Melissa Clapp,"April 11, 2020",4, I like it a lot in almost every way.but one thing I don't like is how complicated it is to use the photos from archive to use my social media so I can make my art
902,Januarius Dorleku,"April 13, 2020",5," I really like it, it works like magic, all my files that I have deleted came back to my storage, because of back up.And that's good."

904,Cynthia Miranov,"April 11, 2020",5, I love having my photos backed up for to changing phones because they don't last like they should. Loosing your phone doesn't mean loosing your photos or contacts thanks to having a Google account. Thanks Google
905,AKANKSHA SHARMA,"April 17, 2020",4," Better than any other photo viewerüëçüèª, still am having a bit to say, make an view ""all videos"" option in the album cuz it becomes easy to search for any .üòä"
906,Raj Raj,"April 4, 2020",4, Great app! It's integration with YT is amazing! Thanks for such a great app! Suggest enhancement: looking at a pic it should tell which album(s) it's part of.
907,Cari Duncan,"April 11, 2020",5," Freaking love this app and how it makes collages, animations, then and nows, and I can search many different people, places, things, animals, whatever!!"
908,MICHAEL RUMBAUGH,"April 14, 2020",3," This app would be a lot better if your pictures didn't dissapear on a regular basis. Not clear or easy to reclaim them once they're gone either.

Not clear or easy to reclaim them once they're gone either. Also, does not work well with Facebook. When creating your story in FB, cannot access all of the pictures available in Google Photos even if you mark them as favorites or add them to albums, leaving you without any access to a lot of your most important pictures."
909,W2,"April 17, 2020",5, Gives me options for organization. Couldn't ask for a better gallery. I always use the features for cropping and rotating.
910,Moses Dadzie,"April 21, 2020",4, This app is nice. I luv de picture editing but they should add more effect . Video editing is very poor. Try and improve on that. Thank you
911,Chris Carreira,"April 11, 2020",2," This app was better when Pixel phones had unlimited full quality picture and video uploads. It was way too easy for Google to steal this away after spending nearly $1,000 on a very subpar Pixel 4 XL..."
912,Shamaun Shamim Mukit,"April 23, 2020",1, Recently I'm not able to see the clicks I've just taken. Gallery is not updating the recent pictures I've taken and taking almost a day to refresh.
913,A Google user,"April 13, 2020",4, Great experience of using this app. Following features will make the app more efficient. 1. Own Security Lock Feature to Protect it 2. Option to delete duplicate photos & videos 3. Dark theme
914,Jan Gesmundo,"April 15, 2020",5, This is one if not the best photo organizer app! I just wish it has the ability to sort the folders according to how the user finds it more easy.
915,Paul Pini,"April 10, 2020",1," Shows pictures all in a cluster, seems to constantly keep changing appearance you start getting use to one way then it gets changed then it's back to being confusing ,hate it !"

918,Jan Beuth,"April 11, 2020",2, Was always super happy with it but since recently half of the pictures I take just disappear or have black bars in them. Already lost a couple of gorgeous pictures without a reason...
919,Spade Mann,"April 22, 2020",5, Backs up your photos to the cloud. Great way to keep your stuff backup and accessible across devices. I enjoy using it.
920,Sanku Kayal,"April 20, 2020",3, The app is good but photos are not loaded in albums created by the user . That's a very frustrating feature . Otherwise the app is well organised with editting features.

924,Max Green,"April 13, 2020",3," This app totally made my day, free storage and all that, but just one problem. How can I download multiple photos/videos. I can only save one at a time."
925,Max Threlfall,"March 29, 2020",4, A great app with great features. However if you clear the space on your photos. You can't access them on other apps from the Google cloud? Seems like a step back to me.

941,Nikki Goudeau,"April 17, 2020",5, Best photo app EVER! Does a lot of things I want/need to do without my assistance. Offers great suggestions. Can't think of a single thing to make it better. Probably the only app I've EVER called perfect. Amazing job Google Photos ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

Plus SO. SLOW. It's a pity this is the native app for photos backup in Android. Only redeeming factor is the Memories.

""very few"". First thing: I had the WORST time syncing things so that they would show up on my computer/desktop, from my phone. When I realised they weren't syncing, there were over 5000 photos to sync (I take a lot, and edit a lot). So then I try to sync them. For the life of me, I can't get them to sync over. So... I start searching. Seems like a few people (that I could find) had the same problem. The fix? I had to shut off my wi-fi, turn on the sync over data option, go back in, then it starts syncing, so I turn the wi-fi on again... it goes for about 250-350 photos... so I think... cool - it's working. NOPE. It goes back to the ""preparing backup"" spinning circle of death. So then I do the same thing. And it works again. Then it gets stuck again. So far I think I've done it about 12 or 15 times... and I still have over 2100 photos to do. So - THAT'S annoying. Second... I have to agree with someone else here, on their low review. WHY, when you delete a phone from Google Photos, does it delete on the stock photo app of the phone as well. Oh and I dislike the editing feature as well - it's very limited.

There's lots of easy editing options and RAW capable. Link sharing is an excellent way to distribute or share content with clients.

It's pretty universally compatible, I use it across phones, tablets, and laptops with no issues what do ever. I highly recommend Google photos."

2408,Amber Duplechain,"March 13, 2020",5, I like the way this app saves all your photos. I love that it can make videos and slide shows on its own. It's edited videos without me even selecting that option. I just opened the app and there was a brand new video with music and everything! I loved it too!

3027,Bryce Painter,"February 28, 2020",3, I really like Google photos overall but their privacy could use some help. In order to hide photos you have to archive them. But even when you do that they still show up in albums and in the camera folder. No true way to hide photos you don't want to show your friends.

3302,A. Maze,"March 23, 2020",5," Wonderful. Everything I record goes here, for free. You can archive old files to make more room. Anything beyond the space Google photos provides is unnecessary in my opinion. A person has more than enough time to transfer their files somewhere else if needed."
3303,Akshay Viruss,"March 17, 2020",5," Other than wishing the paid space was cheaper and it would have higher resolution photos for free storage, it's simply brilliant. The search and facial recognition are scary good. Copying text from image works really well 90% of the time. Uploading photos is also quite fast."
3304,Boomer Mayo,"March 18, 2020",1, This is the worst photo app I have ever tried to use. There are always greyed out pics that don't show up. It is never able to move photos from one Album to another. The slideshow option has absolutely no settings to adjust. Garbage.
3305,Mae E.,"March 16, 2020",1," Sometimes will only show last month's pictures and some from 2018. Everything in between is missing. If I restart my phone and wait for it to ""load"" sometimes everything will show. But after 10 minutes it goes back to only a few images loading."
3306,Gentle G Hines,"February 29, 2020",1, I cropped a picture in Google photos and it automatically deleted the original. I wanted the original and the cropped portion. They should give you the option to delete a cropped photo instead of automatically deleting it themselves. This makes me very angry üò† & disappointed with the application.
3307,Akshita Saxena,"April 2, 2020",5, An awesome app where all your photos and videos can be saved. It does not require much space and can be used to restore items from gallery and save space on your phone .

3450,Emaline D,"March 16, 2020",4," I love it, it's great at keeping my stuff organized. It's just sometimes it'll save a picture I just downloaded and say it's from 2003. I even have one that says I downloaded it in 1968, and I'm pretty sure Google photos didn't even exist during that time."

Although I have unlimited mobile internet, and upload usually works, way too often I get the silly message ""will upload when on WiFi"" - upload on mobile and in roaming is enabled, ofc. BTW, why is Snapseed not part of this app?"

3751,Paul Montoya,"February 21, 2020",5," Great app for keeping pictures in one place. No matter how many phones had pictures, they will be sent to whatever new cell phone you have, as long as you keep your gmail account."
3752,James Dunn,"February 14, 2020",5," All around if you trust Google with the private things in your life, then this is an exceptional app for you and it works quite well for myself. They give you a tremendous amount of space in the cloud to work with and to help preserve your fondest memories!"

3760,JT Sidibe,"March 10, 2020",1, I'm not sure what happened but this app is no longer user friendly. A large number of my photos do not show and/or take a long time to load. Safe to say I am currently looking for another storage app. Any suggestions are welcome
3761,Future Music,"March 11, 2020",5, Super great app... No app can take its place. This app gives you unlimited storage and access from anywhere. Like after uploading on phone you can go and log in on the PC and access it from there too.
3762,David Hamm,"March 19, 2020",4, Im not a techy so is kept giving me error messages. I went to my local boost Mobile store and had to do a factory reset and that didnt work. It too me over an hour and a half to get everything back working!
3763,Kajal Gala,"March 14, 2020",2, The photo once uploaded gets deleted if I delete it from my storage. I've lost many pictures. Pls fix this. There should be an option to organise the pictures. All the pictures are viewed at same place. It would be better if I could organise the pictures.
3764,Jaune Arc,"March 17, 2020",2, This app is broken beyond comprehension. It backs up the incorrect photos refuses to move photos from the download folder (it only copies to the folder you wish to move them too and you can't delete the version in the download folder) amongst many other issues.
3765,Joshua Scalf,"March 17, 2020",5," This app works great for sharing photos, across platforms. I use my cameras, my phone, computer, and email. It gives me peace of mind to know that my images are safe from hardware failure."

3768,Alma Veronica Rodriguez,"February 13, 2020",5," Been using it for ever!! I love that it organizes albums, categorizes everything and everyone. I love that you can edit and just do about anything for one app. It's always a must have. One stop shop for anything photos."
3769,lucas ulibarri,"March 18, 2020",5, This is a great app! I love the feature that Google Photos asks you if you'd like to free up space on your device by deleting the photos that have been successfully saved in the Google Library.
3770,Donna Garland,"April 20, 2020",3, This app is very hard to upload and get into it makes things quite difficult to access.
3771,Danny Rodriguez,"March 25, 2020",5, The app backups all the photos at a remarkable speed so I don't stress if photos are safe from deletion. The other feature that I really like is the 'Free Up Space'. It clears up my phone's gallery while having the pictures already in the cloud.
3772,Michael Hernandez,"March 23, 2020",5, app is all I use for photos. We've already had a really big size 2 phones for a couple of years now. I cannot figure out for the life of me why you still have all the options at the top of the phone. It would make more sense to have everything at the bottom
3773,Michael Hernandez,"March 29, 2020",5, Love this app! They organize all the pictures in a very efficient way so users can easily search for these. I also like the assistant! I've had had lovely memories thanks to it!
3774,Ray bird,"March 27, 2020",5, A great way to back up photos and videos. Especially if you happen to break your devices because you have a clumsy yet beautiful wife. You can transfer and load all your backed up photos to new devices.
3775,Javier Sanchez,"March 5, 2020",5," I love the organization, simplicity, and usability. From time to time the app will select a random photo to enhance, which is a pretty cool surprise on random days."

3777,Oluwatobi Rapheal,"March 6, 2020",3, I have some problems with this app. It no longer group pictures by face. And what is the point in achiving a picture when it won't be protected by a password or something. More privacy is needed please. And fix the face grouping.

3813,C K1,"March 21, 2020",5," The facial recognition is spot on. The automated gifs, collages, short films with sound are perfect. But the absolute best feature of the Google Photos app is being able to organize all the different faces into its own app. Genius!!!"
3814,Brandon Sammons,"March 21, 2020",5," I love it. Keeps everything backed up, unlimited storage! Only thing I would want fixed/added is a way to force a photo of a person in their ""people and pets"" album to help the system learn what to look for."
3815,Anthony L,"March 21, 2020",2, I find the app hard to use and more complicated than the old app. It was much easier when the photos would be saved to Google drive automatically. Now it is much harder and takes a lot more steps to save the photos to Drive.

3870,Becky Simmons,"March 15, 2020",1," Google, you're $hit. How about letting Android users limit the cache size of the app, like iOS users. Photos continue to clog my phone. When I delete data, it just re-downloads everything in a couple of days. This is makes for a horrible experience."

3878,Autumn Dowse,"March 26, 2020",3, Love this app. Although when you choose unlimited free storage you'd expect it to be unlimited and free but it's not. You get a certain amount and then they want you to pay like 1.99 for an extra gb unless I'm misunderstanding something.

4533,Jessie Brooks,"March 25, 2020",3, What happened to the folders in settings that you could upload? It's also stuck on uploading photos when things have been uploaded. The app is choosing on its own what to upload and what not to upload.
