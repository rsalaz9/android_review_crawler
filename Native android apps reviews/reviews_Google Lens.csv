So in such case a need the take a lot of effort to r the Lens to pick the right object or ""bug"" to be specific and then return the search item. Ofcourse once it finds it the data is useful.

6,Lauren Ramirez,"April 22, 2020",5," This app gets my 5 stars because it ended my decade-long search for a painting used at the doors of a bakery that I went to as a child.

For some reason, it suddenly switched from displaying the translated text as an overlay to making you manually select the text you want to translate (and for some reason it seems very reluctant to select more than a few characters at a time). It also will now only show the translation in another app, instead of just showing a real time translation in the camera app."

Occasionally the sign will state the name of the property, size of the availability, maybe a website or an email. It would be great if Google Lens could recognize a hyperlink or email if that exists. Or if there was an option to run a Google search based on the information captured that 'might' take me to the property webpage. Thx"

Performs as expected & continuously produces correct results, w/an acceptable amount of frustrating results. Example, A simple image search of a NBA basketball is answered with images of President Donald Trump, it is possible the President's orange skin color from spray tanning is what threw Google image search off its game. We keep coming back looking for the correct answers to our image questions and some laughable results too."

Or results completely unrelated to the item being searched. If I could make any suggestions it would be that you add an Auto capture feature once the camera focuses.

The Google search engine is already so robust that even if an exact image match is not found one can usually still find what they are looking for. Lens just throws it's hands up and says it didn't find anything. Then it wants you to send feed back on what you were searching for. Then it expects you to hang about for who knows how looking for a response.

I was initially amazed when the app correctly ID'd the part on the first scan. The app even listed some on-line retailers for the part. I wanted to see if I could get it from Amazon, so I switched to the Amazon app. When I tried going back to the Lens app, it didn't show up in the list of recent apps, so I had to reopen the Lens app and rescan the part. My first scan must have been very lucky because this second attempt took many scans to finally get back to my initial result. For some strange reason, Google Lens does not show up in the list of previous apps, which is a pain when you need to switch between Lens and another app. Also, scanning the same thing multiple times produced very inconsistent results from scan to scan."

Maybe I am somewhat ignorant but when two or three dots appear and I am still waiting for a different item to be identified, if I tap the screen it seems to select a random, if not the most recent, dot. Next, the rest disappear or they remain and move around when I try to get a better view of a certain object, even whilst the other dots are in the frame and this causes them to become unrecognizable.

But overall it is an excellent and marvellous app, perhaps one of the best applications developed by Google LLC. If you need a smart app on your smartphone then it's the perfect one. Finally I will finish with a request to Google to add some more scientific updates on the application.(Like capability of identification of elements or minerals.)üòé"

Not once had it ever been successful. Even famous paintings haven't worked. I decided to stop wasting my time with it and uninstalled it.

I really like that it gives you an array of possibilities when the sample photographed doesn't represent its ""species,"" or sometimes its ""genus"" very well.

I find it uniquely nifty. It seems to effectively use some form of AI coupled with the vast store of data and images that Google has, and it usually does a superb job of identifying, for example, unknown plants, objects, text and products that it is shown and delivering information and reference links on same. Potentially a time-saving companion for anyone - e.g., student , busy householder, teacher, office worker.üëç"

I submit the screenshot close-up to Lens, not a cropped image. Google Lens accuracy has been excellent thus far. Thank you app developers for enabling satisfaction of my curiosity.

3950,Luis Fernando Interiano Hern√°ndez,"January 30, 2019",4," It's accurate most of the time but sometimes it doesn't work as intended, for example, you use Lens on a very common plant and the result comes out as a different plant. I'd say this kind of results happen less than 5% of the time."
3951,Davit Kurtanidze,"July 10, 2019",5, This is an excellent app. I think it will be useful to be able to switch to a simple ocr instead of searching the words. Because sometimes it gives completely wrong words in my native language. It is easier to correct the wrong characters than whole words
3952,Abhinay Mane,"May 15, 2019",5, This version of lens is really amazing... The older version was helpful but this one does process way to fa's leading you to very accutate links and object identification... I have scanned insane items n almost always it showed me exactly what I was looking at... Superb job
3953,Dhrithi Maria,"April 22, 2019",5," Really great!! I'm so happy with this app. Since it was basically not supported by Android 7 version, I was unable to install it. But now it has been approved and it works excellently on my phone. Thanks for the wonderful service Google!!"

3965,Mark Lee,"June 28, 2019",5, This is far and away the most Interesting and useful app I have ever installed on my android smartphone. There are a lot of things I believed I knew their identification but was surprised to find the correct answers. We depend on local folklore far too heavily rather than being correct.
3966,Vishal Gharat,"July 25, 2019",5," This app is awesome...i m suggesting one query and hoping to work. suggestion: if i go to any shopping mart and i want to search anything using text then is it possible. example: if i put text as ""Bourbon"" in Google lens app and this text should be searched on objects it gets on lens"
3967,Vitaliy M,"August 17, 2019",5," The app is something I have waited for a long long time! It doesn't work precisely, but if you learn how to use it, you'll get pretty nice results. Good job, Google! Keep enhance the app, it will be one of the most popular in near future!"

3992,ANKUR DUBEY,"August 9, 2019",5, another milestone with this app. everything is just good in this app. only thing should be considered that the zooming should be available in Google lens. so that written text can be scanned which is slight far from the cam. rest is all best. thanks and hopefully it will be considered.

4007,Short arm Fishing,"February 24, 2019",4, This app is helpful trying to figure out something you have no idea what it is. take a picture and it pulls everything it can find out about it. it's not extremely accurate at times but just take a picture again at a better angle and it'll find something for you.
4008,Jason Tracy,"May 7, 2019",4, I find this app to be pretty awesome and quite useful. I'm only rating it 4 stars right now because of the inaccuracy however that's just due to it being new. Over time it will get better.
4009,Bithue Gobien,"November 21, 2018",5, This is an ammmazing app which helps me a lot by saving time. Now I don't have to type long paragraphs. Just put the phone camera on your written paragraph and it's copied. Just paste it where you want.
4010,nicholas decarie,"May 31, 2019",5, This app is one of the most useful apps ever developed by Google. I am an Anglophone living in a francophone province. I love the translation feature because it makes interacting with my government easier for me when I can translate letters on the fly.
4011,Winston Zhao,"June 20, 2019",5," Google Lens is very useful ij my daily life from searching up food to translating text. I hope they integrate this to the Google Assistant ""Whats on My Screen"" feature, that would be very useful. Also, I think food search should go under Dining, not Auto."
4012,Philip Wright,"July 14, 2019",5, This app is essentially witchcraft. It can see into my mind and uses runes of magical origin to determine what it is I am searching for through the camera obscura of my mobile telephone. It is at once incredible as it is terrible in its power. Use sparingly and always wear gloves.

4014,Suman Roy,"August 4, 2019",5," Results are relatable, but need to improve more. And new facility should be provided. Like when we scan a phone no., it should be directly copied in clipboard. So that, we can use it for different purposes. Thank You"

4034,Fusion Developer,"May 20, 2019",5," Notice the option ""google search result"" directly under image. This app should be on every phone. If you see a weird bug, plant, animal and want to know what it is, this app may identify it. It is much faster than asking people."

4062,Malinda Allen,"October 24, 2018",2, Tried identifying several common houseplants including spider plants and rubber plants. The results were all over the map. Google lens couldn't identify a single one. It offered a bunch of weird suggestions instead. You can tell this feature was an afterthought. Uninstalling.
4063,Appleton Mccool,"May 2, 2019",4," Love it! Seeing usefull information come up is great a wonderful throw back to goggles I think it was. Has some issues but I think they are niche. I look forward to the day it catches more cosplay so I can quickly find it's anime, game or what."

4066,James Love,"March 3, 2019",5," I use this a lot for converting photos of documents, signs and notes (even handwritten) to text. It is important to make sure that the document is level and as well exposed as possible. It is a great work aid."
4067,Amy Onaca,"November 27, 2018",5," I have been waiting for an app like this to come along for years and now finally we have one and it is amazing! It works so well and is so easy to use, all you have to do is point at something and tap the screen, I definitely recommend trying it!"
4068,Clare Lockhart,"June 21, 2019",5, Ive never rated 5stars on anything. This is a first. You have to kind of train it but it gets there! It has helped emmensly with identification of the garden plants. Much needed when moved into house with mature garden and you really dont want to kill anything.
4069,Matt White,"July 6, 2019",5," Google lens has correctly identified several plants, animals and products. Sometimes it's off but not that often. It seems to be getting more adept on a weekly to monthly basis."
4070,* Richardson *,"July 8, 2019",1," All this app will do is present a window that says, Lens Thanks for updating. Lens will be available soon. Please try again later. ___ [OK] I click ""OK"" and the app closes. How can we fix this Goog?"

4073,Neels Van Greune,"August 19, 2019",5," Works well on most products and obstacles, would be awsome if you can build in the color spectrum for comparison on invisible products used in surfaces, it will be great for quality insurance etc. Good job by the way. üëçY combinator."
4074,Luna,"August 16, 2019",5," I use Google Lens mostly for plant identification, and honestly it's faster, more accurate and has alongside it extensive information. So far it's been loads better than any other photo identification app I've had before, some even had to pay a monthly fee for."

4078,Greg Kim,"August 29, 2019",5," This app translate books articles, digitize any printed texts, hand written text is hit or miss, but an amazing app. Searching for similar item is utterly useless, but understandably it is a difficult task.

4079,Eduard Pech,"September 3, 2019",1," ""Device not compatible with this version."" Samsung tablet with Oreo 8.1 here. Now I wonder, is that too new or too old? You never know with Google these days. They should really make a new Pixel store for all apps exclusively for Pixels."

4098,Len Martin,"May 13, 2019",5, Amazing... It just occurred to me that it would be awesome to extend the capability of lens to not only identify images but to also identify audio samples. Not meaning music. I'm well aware of that feature.
4099,Akash Singh,"May 1, 2019",5, best smart camera app I've ever used. beautiful experience using this google app and it would help you a lot if you are a very busy person and dont have much time to read the whole document and find out the meaning of each and every word in the documents.üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
4100,aishwarya anand,"May 15, 2019",3, I was focusing on a cloth moth and it didn't gave the right result. Instead it showed some snails species. Kindly get this fixed a little bit more accurately. Otherwise many times it did perform the right way. Keep it improving. Thank You Regards Aishwarya Anand
4101,Rajshekhar Mukherjee,"December 27, 2018",3, Sometimes the app is quite helpful. The text selection feature is very helpful. But the photo identification feature needs more improvement. It's not much reliable and accurate.
4102,Jason,"February 3, 2019",4, The translations aren't as good as the old Google app. Not as easy to use as that app. It did correctly identify some random plants. Which was pretty surprising.
4103,Audrey Delgado,"June 14, 2019",5," I really love this app, here is a suggestion, I love to go antiquing and it would be helpful if we could have an antique database to check if we found something of value or something along those lines"

4108,Trista Thofson,"July 17, 2019",5," Useful and accurate to identify most plants. Although it's not flawless, lens is very facinating to use on many different things. I wish I could find sources of downloaded images a little quicker though."
4109,Golfing Huntington Beach,"August 1, 2019",5," when it works which is in my opinion 85% of the time as to relevance, its awesome has saved me money shopping when I was only looking for ratings saved 20$ on. 45$ item that I was simply looking for reviews pretty cool."
4110,Carly Mora,"September 7, 2019",4," This is the best plant ID app I've found. Works extremely well with an isolated sample, especially with any fruit or flowers. Testing it at the nursery I work at I'd say it's about 75% - 80% accurate and I'm sure that will continue to improve."

4133,Ankur Mathur,"November 30, 2018",5," Gr8 app, saves a lot of time just by analyzing images. Saving a contact is so easy from a physical business card. And so is searching for any product on search. So easy and seamless"
4134,Simon Spoor,"November 10, 2018",5, Works very well. Those people complaining that it doesn't have a problem with their phone ie if you have old hardware it often fails to resolve the image. Works perfect on S9+. Great app.
4135,Rajat Sharma,"March 2, 2019",5," this is good, but it could have been better if results are displayed according to country region and place to be more specific where the search is made from. like currency of nation search initiated, local results for local products in local currency."

4336,Mary Rathbone,"April 20, 2020",5, Fabulous and very helpful.
4337,A Google user,"December 26, 2018",5," This is another high quality, next-gen feature that one gets to expect from Google ! Keep going Google ! But it becomes very useful only when one uses it as it is meant to be."
4338,Pak Ho Wong,"April 15, 2019",1," Thanks for showing ""Thanks for updating. Lens will be available soon."" for 6 months!! I bet the developers think people actually enjoy reading the thank you message more than using the app. üôÉ"
4339,A Google user,"December 9, 2018",4," Super nice, not always accurate, but still cool nonetheless. It does have trouble with backpacks and clothes though, but usually works for food and plants"
4340,Troy Baker,"April 5, 2019",5," I'm surprised, great app. usually I use image reverse application much difference. this one seems to be very accurate and on so far.. I just started using it so thumbs up to Google for another great application."

4343,Michael Stiffler,"April 28, 2019",5," I use this a lot to copy text from computer screens, typed or handwritten notes, to insert into my notes/documents. Only suggestion would be to add a banding box to select what you want lens to process."
4344,PaulEngineer 18,"January 12, 2019",4," Great app, but need some more development! There is some problems recognising some photos and searching results of the specific item does not match with image, a fact that needs improvement"
4345,Ankit Bawa,"May 19, 2019",4, Good tried it only 2 times to just see if it works and it gave me the perfect result for the Barcode i scanned but didnt show anything for the second time when I check by clicking products picüì∑... But overall good app üì≤
4346,Paul Amor,"September 13, 2018",2, it would be nice if Google could come up with an app that does everything including things like QR codes and barcodes which this doesn't appear to do. Why should I have to open multiple apps to do different things?
4347,Doug McClean,"May 25, 2019",5, This app worked great when my wife and I were shopping for some house plants. We were able to research most of the plants without even needing to look at the labels.
4348,A Google user,"January 16, 2019",4, It is very helpful and convenient to serch for things. I request google to please add more features into it. THANKYOU for this because i was searching for this kind of app from 3 to 4 years back.
4349,Steve Barnett,"May 17, 2019",5," This is an amazing App. Give it a try, you will be amazed at how good it is. You don't have to wonder what things are anymore. Just point and click then see how good this app is. Five stars from me."
4350,Akash chirakadavil,"April 4, 2019",5, if you are preparing for an exam and you don't know the answer for a particular question in question paper just show it to your lens .it'll find you the best and simplest ans in the internet üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç.its been a great use for preparing for the my exam

4354,Jeffery P Hodges,"July 16, 2019",5, I use Google Lens all the time. It is very helpful in identifying things you don't know how to describe and it works pretty good too; probably about 90% accurate.
4355,Jenny Black,"August 9, 2019",3, Google Lens only brings up items I'm searching for about 1/3 of the time (give or take). The eBay app has a photo search option that works great if you're searching for the price of specific products.
4356,Thief Of Hearts,"September 11, 2019",1," Doesn't work at all! All it says is thanks for updating. Len's will be available soon. Please try again later. What a trash app, doesn't even work on Google photos anymore like it use to."
4357,Dawn Blair,"October 3, 2019",1," Just installed Google Lens and tried to open it but just gives me an error ""Thanks for updating. Lens will be available soon. Please try again later."" Is it a known issue? Are there any plans on fixing this?"

4365,Aaduu Khan,"April 15, 2020",5, so useful and very good App.
4366,matthew burno,"September 27, 2018",4, its nice and all but they should make this a standalone smart camera app for taking photos with auto selection of what it is to help take fast quick pics and use the google now one for the shopping scanning etc.
4367,Yogendra Sahu,"May 14, 2019",4, app is pretty useful and better than searching about something without knowing anything about it specially for translation of text But it would have been great if it could read handwriting like a pro.
4368,Merijn Hofland,"March 27, 2019",3," was great but now bot working anymore on OnePlus 6 (also checked with colleague) It crashes after clean install. setting the rights manually, the app starts but only shows rotating circle. No camera view."
4369,Michael Bigelow,"February 21, 2019",5," Amazing app! I take a lot of photos and sometimes I forget where one is taken, this app helps me figure it out most of the time."
4370,ForFoxSake,"May 11, 2019",5, Am impressed. Its very accurate and even when it gets something wrong is still very close and helpful. Learns from it too. The most fun App Google do I think.
4371,Cinos Ruddertail,"November 14, 2018",1," Doesn't recognise most things. It works for things with text on them, sometimes, in English... But anything else seems to be a random guess."
4372,priyanka bhattacharjee,"May 8, 2019",4, Its a decent experience so far so good I'll say. The results came back pretty much accurate to what I was searching for everytime except for a few misses.
4373,Francis Koji Okuaki,"October 24, 2018",1," Doesn't work on me. I use Asus Zenfone5 2018. It gets stuck on looking for results. I just wanna copy paste the text, but nevermind I'll just type it."
4374,Anti Johnny,"October 8, 2019",1," it didn't do anything except ""thanks for updating, lens will be available soon"" Update: 10/8/19 reinstalled, it still won't open and just says it will be available soon. Ridiculous. -2 stars"
4375,James Noble Montgomery,"December 5, 2018",3, The app seems like a good idea. Tested for a bit and was pleased with the results. But having uninstall the app my phone appears to think it's still active and in my phone.
4376,Matt Mc Elhenny,"May 14, 2019",4," Was really great, recent updates have reduced original bar code results and shows items that have similar color with stripes instead of translation. Room for improvement."
4377,A Google user,"April 1, 2019",5, This app has so much technology built into it. I use it for everything. Take a pic and it tells you what it is. Take a pic and it copies the words and turns them into links or something you can copy. Best app ever.
4378,phoenix flick,"April 3, 2019",5, Great product/idea. Sometimes bit laggy to identify object because of dull photo or less information about product. Although quite good in identifying QR code and other information. Takes bit more time in daily uses. Great üòÉ
4379,Jonathan Jose,"October 22, 2018",1," After the latest update I am not able to copy the text from the photos that I click , I am only able to search them. Please fix it ASAP!"
4380,Harry Thompson,"September 24, 2018",5," Very cool idea but it doesn't really work with math. But works very well with spelling vocab. Also very good with homework besides math, just basic math like 2 + 4 works."
4381,Tony Stewart,"March 12, 2019",5," 95% of the time this app is right on the money. No doubt, I highly recommend it because it saves me a lot of time helps me find what I'm looking for for very quickly."
4382,Ricey,"May 30, 2019",1," this app is so parasitic that each time I remove it uninstalled it from my phone it automatically reinstalls. this app is useless to me I do not want it, it eats up storage. if I uninstall it, it should NOT reinstall itself. is Google that desperate to collect my data to violate my privacy. üò°üò†üò§"
4383,Pavan,"June 6, 2019",5, God sent app. makes taking text from images so very easy. thank you to the creators of this app. very very accurate. rarely slips that too when the image is not clear.
4384,Darsh Soni,"June 13, 2019",5," ‚Ä¢ Most useful application from Google. ‚Ä¢ Also the selected text can be recognised with it's exact meaning in any language that you prefer. so, Thumbs up üëç for Google. Thank you Team Google."
4385,Akhilesh Mishra,"August 27, 2019",3, Experience is still not good. Distance not clear that upto what distance lens can read. I tried some name with... dots and that directed me to some not relevent website.. I think that happend due to dots between the name
4386,Joshua Berger,"July 8, 2019",5," In two years this app is going to be amazing.. This technology is fantastic. In its current state it already has some use, and I'm excited to see where the developers will take it"
4387,Jeff Simpson,"July 22, 2019",5, This is likely the most useful app i've used for a very long time. It works seamlessly and so fast. The translate option is truly remarkable - get it!
4388,Corey Bottoms,"September 8, 2019",5," Pretty neat app, does a good job at keeping you informed on your surroundings, helps you to know what your looking at without having to run and ask someone, its good to ba able to help yourself when you can"
4389,Selina Deschamps,"September 8, 2019",4, This is really well made. You can translate things using your camera or even from screenshots. It can detect different kinds of animals and their breeds. So useful ~
4390,Kush Patel,"November 2, 2019",5, Very nice app and it is very useful
4391,vansh rautela,"November 25, 2019",4, Excellent work of Google lens

4400,Ionu≈£ Damaschin,"May 26, 2019",5," It's great at identifying plants, even if the plant you're looking for might not be the first suggestion. It's also nice that it can read QR codes."
4401,Mark van der Spoel,"November 10, 2018",5, Tbh it's not flawless. But the AI will learn more and more. The fact that you can determine what's on a picture or aiming the lens app at something and learn what it is is just awesome.
4402,Sumitava Pachal,"May 9, 2019",5," It works great. sometimes due to colour and texture variation, some results might be confusing but it gives more or less correct information 8/10 times."
4403,Redundis,"October 6, 2019",3," After a year, I checked the app out again. The app behaves like goggles, for the most part. Allows you to load images up in it now. Still it seems like this app was shoved down our throats when goggles worked just fine."
4404,Rich Ball,"April 22, 2019",1," Since updating my Nokia 6.1 to Android 9, any time I try to launch Lens it just says, ""Thanks for updating. Lens will be available soon"". It's been months, and no amount of reinstalling seems to fix it üòí"
4405,Arman Afridi,"February 28, 2019",4," well, the over all experience is good. But you gotta improve the functionality. Like, add the image search option with it or add more language"
4406,Ben Liebrand,"September 12, 2019",5," This is a great app and found it very useful. It would even be better if it had the ability to capture tabular data so it could be pasted into Google Sheets. Hopefully, this will be as feature in the near future."
4407,ridhaa shukor,"January 25, 2019",5," i love that it can be used in my reading, to translate any word that I don't know. although I prefer it to automatically shows the meaning/info."
4408,Alexander Irigoyen,"December 30, 2018",4," Lens is a great app for a quick search, but i would suggest an update to the ""animal and plant search"" since I mostly use the app for that. Beyond that, a good job."
4409,Matthew Warren,"November 25, 2018",5, Super cool app and amazing idea. Keeps getting better and better and the more we all use it and share our feedback the better it will get.
4410,A Google user,"February 25, 2019",5," It is a superb app. It gave me 99 to 100% accurate results. I recommend users to download this app rather than going for other search by image apps. Good work, keep it up! üòÄüëçüëçüëç"
4411,Jeffe Homes,"April 28, 2019",3, it doesn't have results for quite a bit of things ive tried searching but the results it has shown are helpful... my suggestion for this app would be to add a rock mineral and gemstone suggest/info/identity feature and i would be using it daily :)
4412,Auril Mazken,"March 10, 2019",5," Best app for searching by image and photo ever! I believe you will do it better further. For example, you can add scanning of screen like in Now."
4413,aswani divi,"April 11, 2019",3, I had taken a snapshot of water bottle. my intention is to search for water bottles like that. instead of showing results for ideal word which is there on bottle.
4414,Isabella Lacourrege,"June 12, 2019",3," Not always accurate, but when it is its very accurate with brand and style of an object. Just needs to learn more with feedback given."
4415,satya prakash kumar,"June 20, 2019",5," This is really helpful. Only if I could use search similar images on google, it could have been more helpful. I really need that feature to counter fake news which is spread everyday."
4416,Vaishant Sah,"July 8, 2019",5," This app is i guess a big step towards the future! I mean shiw it anything and the results are relevant. I have tried it with some mineral bottle bar code, a report card. This is a big step towards future!"
4417,Saruk Ahammed,"July 10, 2019",5, very very useful app. I like it very much. When I do not know the name of anything that time this app help me very much. Thanks to Google to launch such an app.
4418,Roy Danby,"August 1, 2019",4," it is accurate more times than not in my experience, althoigh that being said it was mainly at fairly well known statues and monuments. i find it very useful to get more information about paintings or landmarks etc."
4419,S Anand,"August 25, 2019",3, App is really fine and workin excellent. But developer must add a feature to take the pic properly and then read the text. So that it may work better. Thanks to Goggle Lens Developer ....
4420,Ritchie Heys,"August 27, 2019",5, I would like to say that's the app I have just put on and tried I have found it very easy to use . Knowing that I am not good at reading. I find it it really helpful in my shopping.
4421,Dom Greco,"August 23, 2019",3, I like this app that anyting that I take a picture of it gives me the information or the prices but you guys still have to improve on this app on the accuracy a whatever I point my camera at but keep up the awesome work I know you can do it

4424,Mama Ray,"October 1, 2019",1, The second I open the app it captures whatever my phone is pointing at with no option other than to back out and try again. Never thought I'd say this but Bixby does it better in this case.
4425,Lisa Miller,"October 1, 2019",5," I bought a phone which was intended to be sold in a country with a different language.

I received an update notification in that language but could not read the details. I took a screenshot and opened that in Lens and it was translated for me quickly. I also enjoy doing the same thing with foreign language memes I find on social media. When out and about and I see a plant or a bird I can't identify, I can usually take a pic of it and Lens can help me with that as well. Love this useful app!"
4426,Ayush Gautam,"October 6, 2019",1, Google usually do it apparently this time they could've done better. I used it for regular household items to check its use but couldn't get much out of it. App needs considerate time to develop. Happy stone age:)
4427,Meilinda Laraswati,"October 30, 2019",5, This app is advantageous for detecting the translation of other languages. Thanks

4443,Daniel van Heerden,"January 12, 2019",5, Cool app. Would be even better if there was a overlay of the matching areas to make the decisions for what it comes up with.
4444,A Google user,"March 30, 2019",4, it doesn't have the things which we need. For example it can't scan bar codes. needs more improvements. and know the price of clothes
4445,VJ Joseph,"May 19, 2019",5," I can easily use it to copy paste text from books into word documents without even typing, by using this to copy and pasting it in Google Keep. It saves me lot of typing time. Thank you Google."
4446,Tallawah Vixen,"May 5, 2019",5," This is just a 'first impressions' more than an actual review. I pointed my camera at three items and was shown three accurate pictures of what the items were. It does what it says on the tin, so it will stay on my phone for now."

4451,Brian Murphy,"September 21, 2018",3," It's alright. Goggles seemed to work better. I feel if you are going to replace a app, it should at the least work as well or better than the previous one."
4452,Durand Victor,"March 18, 2019",5," simply awesome app, especially for insta scan the content of a printed document, find brands or exact models of furniture and products with insane speed and accuracy."
4453,Anon Amous,"May 2, 2019",1," Google deleted my ""spam-ware"" review. Why can't they delete ""google lens"" from my phone? why is this even here? did it piggyback seriptciously on another app? Hey Zuckerbot. ""google"" privacy, and freedom of choice."
4454,Takeshi Hiraoka,"January 13, 2019",1, I can focus on the camera app just fine but lens can't seem to focus very well at all. Even when it does focus QR code reading is very hot or miss. Majority of the time it misses. Super frustrating.
4455,David Mitchell,"June 19, 2019",3, cant always be 100 percent accurate whatever information I do get from Google lens I kind of try to take with a grain of salt pretty cool feature though if they can guarantee 100% accuracy and that would be amazing

4597,R R,"October 23, 2019",4, Good filtering. Photos were detailed enough for me to find a close match to my item of 9 card slots + 1 zipped coin holder + 3 side slots + 2 hidden notes slots ... extremely hard to find match.
4598,Shawn Coldren,"October 25, 2019",5," Cool app. I've just started using this app, but so far the coolest feature to me is, you take a picture of anything, and it allows you to shop for it and things similar. A++"

4622,David Vermeulen,"February 22, 2019",5, love it. hooe it gets even better as user base grows. the UI could do with some more work like sync it with a users search history and related users
4623,Zeeshan Ashraf,"October 14, 2018",1, This app is not working on my Nokia 7 plus and I don't know why üò£ really disappointing. Google LCC Please fix this problem or somebody other help me to fix it. Thanks.
4624,Clean Psy,"April 4, 2019",5, Nice application but you should put more languages and enable the assistant to open with voice command. But defenatly the lens app is on of the top application to have in your smartphone.
4625,John Thome,"September 20, 2018",1," This app sucks. It doesn't work for anything and I like goggles better. I tried barcodes, bugs and other stuff I find at work and it could recognize anything."

4632,Giselle Schneider,"June 16, 2019",1, I scanned a heart necklace and got results for pendants NOTHING like what I scanned. I tried it multiple times until all I got were rosaries. Then I tried to scan a holiday candlebra and a television with no results
4633,Jewel S,"July 17, 2019",3, i just wanted to know whether the app really works..it is not accurate..i also had a similar idea that such an should be there.. because there are many things that we see and don't know it. this is just great.

4635,Tim McAuley,"July 27, 2019",1, Not exactly sure what it's supposed to do. I took a picture of a Wendell Willkie pin and it didn't come close. I tried several other objects and it just got crappier with each try.

4669,Darian Velasquez,"May 17, 2019",5, this app is great. the one issue i have is sometimes the information given does not match the photo taken ie with some plants and flowers.
4670,WeCo W,"May 15, 2019",5," Knowing the technology ""under the hood"" of the app, it's impressive to see how fast the neural network works in recognising the visual patterns."
4671,Guillaume Panot,"May 19, 2019",1, Great app idea but poor detection in general compare to other apps. Even a Google image reverse is better. I was thinking they use the same or very similar API but maybe different algorithm behind.
4672,Dave Carr,"February 6, 2019",5," THIS IS AWESOME!!!! I used it to find products, enter tracking numbers for USPS, UPS or FedEx. it even told me what something was."

4678,Shahid Sayyed,"June 2, 2019",1, shows adds/results for only specific partner providers(read bias) . which is the business model.. the Bible for Google. so uninstallation felt the only thing to do. ps. i use duck search and brave browser

4685,Lucy Diengdoh,"August 8, 2019",4," 4 stars for as it's still in it's nascent stage... overall a fantastic product from Google..the fifth star will come when Lens is accurate as Shazam. Nevertheless great work Google...as of now,just gotta keep on grinding!"
4686,Christopher Zhong,"September 19, 2019",1," I'm extremely confused about this app. From the default camera app, I can still use Google Lens regardless of this app is installed. So as far as I'm concerned, this app is useless"
4687,Grant Giorgi,"August 26, 2019",4," Very cool app, point the camera over the main logo ""Coca Cola"" etc and it brings up what you're looking for, awesome, obviously I tested it on a very popular item but still very cool tech."
4688,Luke Strain,"September 2, 2019",5, Highly recommended. If you have a Samsung Galaxy S8 or higher I suggest downloading this app. It is 10X better than Bixby and it actually works. I would give this app more stars if I could.

4691,Jitu Pardhi,"September 28, 2019",5, Man this app is so good. I just wish there was a way to save the picture that I just translated. It would save so much time. Also maybe adding a way to do reverse image search?
4692,Robert Yeomans,"October 7, 2019",1," Don't know what is going on with it, just keeps saying thank you for updating, lens will be available shortly. I've even tried uninstalling it and cleaning it. Liked it and it would be nice to use it again."

4694,Arturo Tinoco Sr,"October 16, 2019",5," Google Lens hardly missed some articles, but it helps to find out what I'm looking for or where it's selling the product I'm aiming and I can use too from my pics album that are on my phone."

4747,Piyush Sachdeva,"August 12, 2019",5," Great app to use, find unknown items, know about new places. Best part is to get text from images and translate them into your language."

4809,MasterFish,"September 24, 2019",5," Great App, it feels great to be a small part of something global and big. I enjoy contributing to Google's machine learning algorithms. I believe, that very soon, AI will make our world a better place. Good job Google and Ray Kurzweil."
4810,A Google user,"October 7, 2019",1, Not accurate at all. It identifies a sweet as a machine! I can't believe that it is developed by Google. It has to be on of the worst app by Google. Uninstalling this app.
