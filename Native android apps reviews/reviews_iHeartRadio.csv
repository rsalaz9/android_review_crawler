App often shuts off sound for no reason. Promos for a free trial of their premium service are annoying. I unwillingly signed up for a 14-day trial when I tried to hit the x to get rid of it and was never able to use it anyway, so I can't comment on the premium service, only the free one."
1,Tricia Ficht,"April 25, 2020",4," I really love iHeart radio. I like being able to save the songs that I like.

IHeart commercials come on, for example ""Here are the top Billy Joel songs you gave a thumbs up to"". Then the commercial will loop endlessly unless I hit stop, then play again. I found a Facebook post going back five years saying this was a problem, with more recent ones as well. Please fix."
3,Steven Daugherty,"April 11, 2020",4," Repeats too many of the same songs over and over even ones with a thumbs down rating.

Also, just because a song gets thumbs up doesnt just mean I want THAT song played over and over, it means I want more songs like it. Do your research on the bands that we like, and find bands that maybe we dont know yet.... new bands, new songs, and new twists are such a positive listening experience. Thx, AND OF COURSE, I ‚ù§ radio!!!"

I have a Samsung S9+, and since the update, podcasts will pause and spin and once it starts playing again, it's some random episode instead of picking up where it paused. Then I have to go back to the list and scroll (a few times because it keeps reloading) to get back to my episode. Then it happens again 10 or so minutes later. I love this app so I hope it can be fixed!"

When I open the app, it just starts playing whatever I was listening to last. That needs to be fixed, that should be an option. Another issue is with the podcasts, a lot of the time when I do want to ""pick up"" where I left off on a podcast, it won't play the podcast at all or starts to play but with no sound. That's very frustrating, especially since I PAY for this app monthly!"

If you want to get into more than basics you can pay for it but what it does is enough. Paying for it gives me some advantages like skipping and many play lists. They have podcasts if you'd rather not listen to music. Now they need some Old Time Radio Shows or Audio Books and it will be a well rounded listening experience.

I don't use it for music, but I don't listen to music often. I think the search function returns items with the keyword in the banner rather than topic, so that could use improvement, and it does crash on me sometimes. Still would suggest you give it a try."
9,Mary Schwartz-Lair,"April 18, 2020",5, Love it but the one thing I don't like is being that you charge people who wants to pick and choose song and you are still limited. That's why I didn't keep the subscription. I did the free trial but it's not worth the money. To me it's not fair price and not every song is available to listen to.

With work being slow and no money to pay for spotify or any other premium apps, turning to iheart radio has been a godsend. Listening to all your favorite radio stations and songs from all gere, passing the time has been easier, not only can you listen to radio stations but it also tells you the name of the song and who its by, so no more searching or guessing the names and artists of songs. Love this app and pretty sure you will to."

Unfortunately, the app seems to want me to listen to different stations. Whenever I listen to my station it plays one song and stops, sometimes two. Then I have to stop what I'm doing and restart it to play the next song and so on. Any other station plays normally song after song until I stop it or change stations. Would have been 5 star all day long with minimal ads."

18,Matt Ross,"April 25, 2020",5," What can I say? 1/2 the price of the others, and plays: the radio, podcasts, any song on the fly, custom playlists, great suggestions, and has it all in HD with great fidelity. 102.5 WDVE and iHeart ""Vinyl Classic Rock"" make the paid subscription worth every penny by themselves. ;-) -=cvisionz=-"
19,Terry Weber,"April 21, 2020",5, I use the app primarily to listen to live radio broadcasts and for podcasts. It seems to to a better job of recovering from dropouts in marginal cell coverage areas on road trips than other similar apps. That actually makes it safer for drivers because it seldom needs manual intervention to recover.

I usually have to unlock my phone and open the app to hit play again. I've removed and installed the app and it worked for about 2 days then it started cutting out again. A suggested fix would be great to continue using iHeart.
21,Cleveland Eason,"April 17, 2020",5," My need for Sirius radio has reduced significantly since the ability to listen to my favorite radio station regardless of physical location. Since it's my favorite radio station, I am also subjected to radio ads, something I do not experience with Sirius."

23,E Christian,"April 23, 2020",5, I love the features that allow you to save songs to a playlist for free. And it's a great outlet for finding new music!! I love this app so far. However as of 4/23/20 the app is not working properly. And may be susceptible to interference from other apps.

27,Paul Mader,"April 24, 2020",5, I have been using iHeartRadio for a long time. I use it for talk radio and political podcasts. It is perfect for all that. I have all my podcasts saved and I can follow who I want. It is really just an easy to use app that I am so thanful for.
28,Dana Collins,"April 10, 2020",5," Great app, have been using it for awhile now. Although recently, I notice the radio stops playing when I close all my apps. Before, the radio would still play in the background, even if I closed out all the apps."

34,Dur'id The Druid,"April 24, 2020",3," A good free app. But I am only giving 3 starts because of a tech problem. The player shuts down every 20 to 30 min, and I don't see any way of adjusting that in the settings. This is not a replacement for radio yet. Though the signal is usually better."
35,Allison Endicott,"April 15, 2020",5, Love the selection of podcasts and stations. Episodes auto adbance if you want to catch up on a podcast. I use the sleep timer all the time since I like to go to bed with noise but then it turns off after an hour.

40,Amelia Guest,"April 12, 2020",2," Declining. This app used to be awesome but as time goes on, it's gone from a few ads to 20 repetitive ads for every song or two. And it's ALWAYS the same ads, every time, over and over. I actually sometimes choose silence over listening to them again."
41,Kyndall Carnes,"April 13, 2020",4, I love this app! I listen to podcasts at work and it's so nice to be able to find what I want to listen to all in the same place. The only thing that I don't like is that when you follow a new podcast it automatically downloads new episodes instead of just giving you the option when you hit follow.
42,Kellie Smith,"April 24, 2020",2," Is was fine. No problems. Now all I hear is ""these are the top 3 songs by......that you thumbed up"" and repeats continually. Commercials repeated, 3 or 4 times in a row. And I have never thumbed up any songs by anyone"

45,D Naples,"April 23, 2020",4," BEST AIO streaming app for radio and podcasts. Free version works fine, but annoying popups' timing and coverage means I visit a lot of S I don't want when my fat fingers try to close them. I'm sure that's by design... Good luck, enjoy!"
46,Stephanie Loyo,"April 13, 2020",2, Great app and use it daily. The ads though are starting to get ridiculous. Please stop pausing my podcast audio to plug an ad only to hear it again at the end of that episode and at the beginning of the next one. Ads alone make me want to stop using the app.

52,Tony Pham,"April 20, 2020",4," I like the app a lot with it's easy to use interface and its huge selection to podcasts but it tends to take up a lot of storage compared to my other apps. Even with the auto download turned off, other than that I'm happy with it."
53,Dane Holo,"April 11, 2020",3," Used to be my favorite free streaming service, mainly because ads were so infrequent (maybe 1 an hour). Now my music is interrupted every few songs. It's getting worse than Pandora with all its ads."

59,Mike Tresham,"April 13, 2020",5, I use iheartradio all the time. I listen in my truck with android auto. It integrates seamlessly w/WAZE. I like the crystal clear digital signal. It prevents weak reception and static on am due to terrain features.
60,Michael Taylor,"April 8, 2020",5, Really freaking great app. I can choose from any artist station and will end up discovering other great artists similar to them. Would definitely recommend for anyone needing a way to listen to music without downloading songs or podcasts heck you can even tune into your preferred radio stations
61,Jesse Sullivan,"April 12, 2020",5," Most stations are great. Pink Floyd should be changed though. Their the dark side of the moon, not top 40 like Spingstein or Melloncamp. They should be paired with symphonic music like November rain, or brain melting guitar solos."

64,Naomi Ah Toon,"April 20, 2020",1, Disappointing because it's forever buffering! Especially in the middle of a good song! Have had to uninstall a few times. It was working well after that then 2 days later same thingüòñ Left it altogether!
65,Bill Neuman,"April 13, 2020",1," No way to pause a live broadcast. Must be stopped and then iheart runs of string of ads. Therefore, when they are having streaming troubles, you get to hear those ads over and over again. Agonizing ap."
66,Samantha Henise,"April 23, 2020",5, iheart radio is so amazing they have it all down to awesome stations and music to live radio to all the wonderful contests!!! Custom radio and songs similar to favorite genres or similar songs its fantastic!! Makes me feel good every time thank you iheart radio üòç
67,Grace Laine,"April 10, 2020",4," very good the only thing I don't like about it is, I have to keep the app open all day in order for it to play and if I close the app the song I was listening to is lost and won't play until next time."
68,Francesca Maria Fernandez Guillen,"April 17, 2020",5," The only thing is....when I look for a SONG.......I want to hear THAT song. Thereafter, I can hear the genre of music. Other than that. I love it. Better than Pandora. üòé"
69,A West,"April 18, 2020",4," It's got so much content, which is awesome! It can be hard navigating and searching to find specific stations or podcast channels though. At least at first. After a month of using it, it's getting easier."
70,kelly martin,"April 24, 2020",1, Since the latest update my music is going in and out stopping when my screen goes off (I've changed my settings to avoid screen timeout). I'm paying for the app and am considering finding a different app.
71,MELISSA Yuchniuk,"April 17, 2020",5, Love the mix tapes that are created based on what I listen to üòÉ. Easy to use and free! The ads are not to invasive although they are slightly repetitive.
72,Ankit Goyal,"April 12, 2020",5, Minimal ads. Free music at shuffle through playlists and dummy radio stations and live radio stations. Also free podcasts! This is the best app to listen and discover music for free. You just need to know what to follow.
73,Angela Williams,"April 13, 2020",3, The app does not stay open when I hit pause. Then when you try and play from where you left off (specifically for podcasts) it does not save your spot. Very annoying
74,Sylvain Thibodeau,"April 11, 2020",4," One of the best radio music app and totally free. For once, a playlist can be selected and it play that style and beat compared to many other app that goes to depressive song after 2 or 3 songs of each playlist."

80,Crystal Jordan,"April 21, 2020",5, iHeart - have monthly subscription l. Love the different genre of music can select from. The radio stations are perfect for easy listening. Plays new releases and keeps music playlist updated.

85,Shaun Davidson,"April 17, 2020",4, The music is the absolute best with nothing disappointing played all day. Only issue is the connection on some days is a little dodgy but I assume that is because of it's popularity and the number of people streaming.
86,Cyndee Schwartz,"April 19, 2020",4, Wish it wasn't so expensive. Loved that they gave us a free 2 week membership during the pandemic üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü. Use it all the time and usually love what plays.

I am older now and yet I am an even BIGGER hopeless Romantic... I am back with IHeart after a few years and I really enjoy the podcasts and talk radio . I think it is a terrific app and it offers anything you might possibly want to listen to.
89,Non ya Business,"April 22, 2020",1," Okay, for real, you're putting too many ads into this app now. I can't listen to my music anymore without an ad interrupting and it's getting annoying as heck. I might as well use YouTube at this point"

95,Jeremy Stickle,"April 13, 2020",5, Love it. It seems like it finds what I'm looking for. It knows my taste in music like it can read my mind. Great app for listening to music in the car.
96,Emily Gowans,"April 21, 2020",4, Love that I can close the app and still have it play. It has a ton of songs just the adds and limited skips suck but I think that can be topped if u buy the premium version.
97,Matt Helton,"April 10, 2020",5," Great app, they have tons of pod casts, and every kind of music that you could ever want to hear. Highly recommended!!!"

Or how to fix it??"

Every song played by these stations was interrupted six or seven times with extremely long buffering. There's no reason for this, especially since I'm getting max reception on my phone.

504,allen herbert,"February 2, 2020",1," After 2 or 3 songs it pauses it self. I have to keep opening it up to un pause. Very inconvenient when I have to keep going inside to put the music on. If it keeps up, I'll just delete this app and download a different music app."
505,Sam Battin,"February 6, 2020",4," Good selection. No way to share or discover playlists. Interface with Amazon needs improvement, you can only open ""artist radio"" rather than songs or playlists, and the ""radio"" never send to play the artist you requested, only artists that the algorithm had decided are similar to the artist."
506,Jordan Gerardine,"February 2, 2020",4," I like the stations , but one thing. If it's on let's say Korn station, it will only play Korn about one song an hour. I would like to hear more of the songs from the band that the station I put on. Other than that it's a great app."
507,DM Picard,"February 16, 2020",4," Music selection is good. Sometimes it strays from the artist station I have selected. Missing some of my favorite podcasts. The ads are terrible. Other than that, its nice to turn on and hear a lot of my favorites."
508,Steven Clark,"March 10, 2020",4, Awesome app it does run in my background when I'm not using it which is a drain on the battery I have to go to settings and force stop. the podcast are good but it's hard to tell what I have listened to and not have listened to when I download a podcast all in all pretty good
509,Christina Cabe,"March 28, 2020",5," Love this app! It's exactly like listening to the radio. Sometimes it's a couple minutes off, but that's only aggravating of you're listening for contest purposes."
510,Steve Northrup,"April 6, 2020",3," It's OK but the stupid notifications are incessant. üòí I don't listen to all the pop music iHeart pushes, so the notifications are a PITA üöΩ. I've tried to block notifications but the PITA notifications persist üòï."
511,Deborah Martin,"April 11, 2020",4," Able to listen to my local stations through this app, no other app allows me to listen to what's going on in my area! Does have minor interruptions but not prolonged. Thank youü§ó"
512,Ron Miller,"April 16, 2020",5, Enjoy the music except when they slip in a song or band that is not in my normal music..
513,Michelle Pereira,"April 18, 2020",4," Great variety of current and older music, classics in every genre"
514,Charlie Maximum,"April 16, 2020",5, Need more different song rather than play some then repeating. New music everyday no repeats ever
515,Nelly Estrella,"April 10, 2020",5," Awesome, really enjoy my music which in return, makes my day so much relaxed in these difficult times ."
516,Alvin Woods,"April 17, 2020",5, Minimal ads. Love the sleep timer. Great sound.
517,Shawn Gibson,"April 14, 2020",1, You cant mute adds I get you cant skip unless you pay but damn let me mute it makes me want to get rid of it the adds are long and annoying
518,Alexandria Harrison,"April 16, 2020",5, This app is great for listening to your favorite radio stations. You could even discover new ones.
519,Valerie McDowell,"April 20, 2020",5, Great.I just wish it didn't have to get a trial for unlimited skips.
520,Jeff Wright,"April 22, 2020",1, When the program I listen to goes on a break I am treated to a repeating loop of obnoxious ads!
521,Tommy Miller,"April 24, 2020",5, It's very nice to listen to good music from the 1950s and 1960s without the annoyance of commercials.
522,Frank Farkas,"February 1, 2020",4, Awesome quality. Needs more variety of songs and albums played from artists. It seems as though for instance pantera station plays only a handful of their songs over and over. Example pantera plays drag the water over and over but never heard their arise song yet.
523,Tasheena Davis,"February 28, 2020",5, It cuts off constantly. I'm not sure why. It's very annoying and would be great besides that issue. UPDATE: iheartmedia gave me a suggestion and it worked!! This app is fantastic!!! Thanks for assisting me.
524,Richard Spicer,"February 5, 2020",2, Usually work okay. But I'm very tired of having to start playing my radio station every 5 minutes. There is no way I would subscribe and pay for more access if you can't even probably provide the free part of you app.

The media player I use for playing local MP3 files plays just fine through the headphones, but switching to this app without changing anything else may still result in media audio not honoring the proper output."
526,Crystal Washington,"February 11, 2020",3," This actually sucks!! I updated my iHeart and the music continuously stopped after three songs... It messes up my Groove !! I can't run without stopping to check it, I can't clean without running back to restart it ....we just had an update what's the problem"
527,Michael McClimans,"February 5, 2020",2, I use mutiple music streaming services. Each has it's own attributes. I acknowlege the necessity of advertisements. The ads employed here are a bit more intrussive than I like. It seems they've even timed their appearance to cause unintentionally clicking them.
528,Gregg Taylor,"February 16, 2020",5," I listen to a lot of classical music and public radio( MPR NPR) so IHeart Radio has me covered on all levels. Also, I like how they have included popular podcasts on their platforms. I wish they had a function to rate and review such podcasts."
529,Dischord Sedi,"February 29, 2020",5, I have some basic and some extremely weird or rare taste in musick. This app allows me to just hear what I want to hear when I want to hear it. I cannot express how happy this app makes me on a true daily basis! Wish I could give it a 30 star rating.
530,Samantha Holmes,"March 14, 2020",1," Overall, extremely slow and glitchy lately. Any interruption (calls, disconnecting from a Bluetooth device, even shutting down the app) causes a podcast to start from the beginning. Having to constantly figure out where you were in the podcast is incredibly frustrating."
531,Mike Ortiz,"March 14, 2020",5, Love the music but the only thing that happens is when I go back to the same station it seems to go back to the same song it started with which makes me think it's on a loop which defeats the purpose of listening to different music not the same as when I started the station I like.
532,lee eubanks,"March 21, 2020",2," I've had I hear for a long time, but this is the first time I've ever had a problem. My songs end after each song and I have to push play after song ends and it is very annoying. I've looked through every option, not sure how to fix."
533,Gregory Davis Jr.,"March 30, 2020",4," Good stations, easy interface. Only problem is that sometimes it has a habit of buffering on certain platforms, but I can live with it!"
534,MacQ,"April 5, 2020",5," I love gospel music. Soon as I uploaded iHeart on my phone and saw Tasha Cobb Radio, I tap on it, save it on my playlist, and kicked back with the volume on high listening to all of my favorite gospel songs! Great app! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüëç"
535,Ben Gamez,"April 8, 2020",2, Has a lot of variety which is great! It doesn't function well. I will be listening to one podcast and then starts playing another podcast on its own. Grrrr
536,Dad L Doit,"April 10, 2020",5," Great radio: oldies, live cricket, talkback, news, I haven't used any radio since downloading iheart, at home, in the car in my caravan. Thanks iheart radio, radio when there is no radio coverage."
537,Timothy H Wells,"April 11, 2020",3, I hate how the long stream of ads overrun radio show content when they FINALLY get back to the show.
538,Ashley Hamilton,"April 8, 2020",1," Free trial ad constantly pops up, very easy to inadvertently accept the offer, extremely difficult to cancel! Not easy to navigate, FAQS just take you in circles, very annoyed with this app!"
539,S W,"April 7, 2020",1, I like the free use for KFI and only KFI 640 AM Los Angeles. No I don't want any subscription. The app forced me to take a trial subscription. I don't want that. How do I take that off? Just ignore it when it expires because I only use the free service?
540,Andre Mendez,"April 7, 2020",4, Great way to listen to radio stations without reception interference. Love it.
541,Desmond Bowman,"April 17, 2020",5, Love this radio station. It gave me back my laugh and happiness when my Sister died.
542,Zean Renee Moran,"April 10, 2020",4," I wish it didn't always bug us about the 7day trial but, it does have awesome music"
543,Justa Me,"April 13, 2020",4, My experience was great except for 100.3 the Bus who regularly gave their stupid station identification antics but not iHeart radio keywords or iHeart contests. Pretty weak if you ask me. I will never tune that staion again
544,Michael Lee,"April 13, 2020",5, Love it; it's the only app I listen to and the podcast are great.

547,Deb Blee,"February 17, 2020",4, Works great and not a data hog. Totally worth the 9.99 per month.... 12/20/19 update streaming is choppy for past month canceling all access. Not worth it PS I already tried to reach out... 2/17/202 glitches seem to be fixed. Not sure if I will pay to upgrade again..
548,Pam Kramer,"January 31, 2020",2, The new update is terrible. The app now requires it to be open when you are listening. What the hey. It was great that I could close and still listen and pause etc. May have to stop using the app because this is probalematic.
549,Erin F,"February 15, 2020",2," Since last update, I have to keep app up to listen to podcasts and radio. I used to be able to clear my screen and it will still run with just the icon on top.. This is very irritating now. Please fix this and get rid of this update"
550,Matt Rose,"February 20, 2020",2, This app has been going downhill over the last 2 years. The same commercials over and over for weeks. When you are done listening and select exit it doesn't shut down. I've had to go into settings and apps to force stop.

552,Hilary Weyant,"March 2, 2020",3, Pretty good overall except playback does not work. Auto downloads don't play. And when I start a podcast and want next episode it starts in opposite order. Doesn't go to next unplayed episode. But still like it better than other podcast players!
553,Mike Rempel,"March 12, 2020",4, this app is great. It's easy to navigate there are tons of radio stations and podcast available. The only thing that needs to be added as when you are following a podcastthat you could search within that follow podcast for individual podcast other than the scrolling
554,L.B. Cre Stephenson,"March 31, 2020",4, Most reliable in playing the artist you request and similar musical sounds. I love it. Just hate the ads. But I understand to Make Money...They Need Ads...So Pay for The Ad Free if You Can Afford It.
555,Joel Tafoya,"April 1, 2020",5," I can take my favorite hometown radio station with me everywhere! Premium users can save music to playback any time, plus all your favorite Podcasts. You need a soundtrack for your life...iHeartRadio can get you there!"
556,Joanna Martinez,"April 15, 2020",3, I love this app. I just don't like how it doesn't remember what you thumbs down a song and plays it again..... Then what's the use of taking your time to thumbs down it and wasting a skip lol just saying
557,Jacquelyne Hollis,"April 15, 2020",5, Love to hear radio stations from other states! Or what ever I'm in the mood for!
558,A Google user,"April 22, 2020",5, I use it for my work outs and to catch up on talk radio podcast.
559,Denise Lange,"April 22, 2020",5, Love the live radio options. I miss phones coming with FM radio installed on them. #OldSchool
560,Jacki Zaugg,"April 21, 2020",4, It lags device a bit sometimes but it supplies good choices in music genre.
561,Rodney Heinrich,"March 10, 2020",5," I have to say that this is my only music app. There was a glitch where ads came up every time I moved my phone from vertical to horizontal or vice versa, but it appears to have been fixed. I love the expansive library of podcasts, as well as some of my favorite radio stations."

564,Mark Pillar,"February 6, 2020",4, I love that you can pick your own songs but the search feature is kind of sketchy. Sometimes you can type in this title of the song and it doesn't exist. Then you can type in the artist and scroll through the album and find that song.
565,Philip Picker,"February 24, 2020",1, Love the convenience of this app but it plays way too many advertisements. Everytime the station pauses purposely or accidentally and even for just a split second it plays some commercial before it will play the station again. Finally tired enough of it to leave a review
566,Janet Luevano,"February 15, 2020",3," I know I pay for a subscription but every time I try to use anything and I mean ANYTHING on this app I am asked to upgrade. Then it won't let me do anything! Playlist, save a song, create one - frustrated!"
567,Y rothberg,"March 4, 2020",5, I always loved the app and it worked well. I travel alot and it was great to take my local radio stations around the world. However of late the app only plays one radio station. The rest don't work. Any advise?
568,Jennifer Campbell,"March 13, 2020",5," I love the 80s songs best and i listen to Lost 80s hits station regularly! This app also has most any song you could think of in almost any decade. I love it so far and as long as it stays great, I will keep the $10 monthly membership to listen to my playlists offline."
569,Bradley Harrell,"March 5, 2020",2," . I understand it's a free app and someone has to pay for it to work but dang the ads are crazy. If you pause a song you get a ad , in the middle of a song ad . WiFi disconnect and re connect ad five minutes pass ad . And it's the same ad"
570,Misty&Jake Hiller,"March 28, 2020",2, App keeps shutting off. I usually play it while Im sleeping. If I dont keep my screen unlocked it wont continue to play all night. It did that for a while but now even if I have my screen on all night it still keeps shutting off. I cant sleep without music üòûüò£
571,Gabby Taylor,"April 11, 2020",3, I absolutely love this app they have all of my favorite songs but what I don't like is that I have to pay to have unlimited skips and be able to listen offline. But other than that it's great.
572,joe sisson,"April 4, 2020",5, Once iHeartRadio got an idea what I like it was off and runnin playing what I like with no need of request. Plays in the background so as to never interrupt anything else I'm doing. Thanks iHeart!

583,Geri Rapp,"March 14, 2020",5, I'm at the gym 5 days out of 7 and some songs can really motivate me. I love that I can play my faves over and over (and over) and stay energized. My only wish is that I could alphabetize the list so it wouldn't take so long to find what I'm looking for.
584,Chrystina Lammers,"March 12, 2020",5," So many options. Podcasts, talk radio, music, news etc. I love it. Only complaint I'd have is on ""my station"" it only plays the same 4 comedians over and over no matter how long I listen or how many different comediens I listen to in the comedy section."
585,Kyle Peltier,"March 24, 2020",3," Used to work well. Now it skips, pauses and cuts out all the time when I play it through car blue tooth. There is no support but many complaints online. Purchase with caution, try free first to see if it works."

596,JezeBella C-S,"February 9, 2020",5, Love the playlists too bad you have to pay for it. It's great but I wouldn't but it. Other than the fact you have to buy it also has too many ads to buy it. But keep up the great work. Works great with my Samsung Active Fitbit love it!! üëçüëç‚ù§
597,Karlynda Pringle,"February 19, 2020",1, I have literally heard the same song 3 times in one hour. I listen because the radio station I like is not in my area but come on between the 10 minute commercials and the same 5 songs over and over again is ridiculous!!!
598,Kristin Mudra,"March 12, 2020",5," The UI is super easy to navigate, the search function is useful across all types of content and brings up results in a way that makes it super easy to find what you are looking for. So far, it seems like a great all-in-one app!"

611,Harold Fisher,"February 28, 2020",3," App changed. Now instead of just hitting the icon for the station I want to listen to, I have to hit the icon then hit the play button. I love it when developers make apps LESS convenient. Would be 5 stars if not for this."
612,Jesus Tobon,"March 2, 2020",1, Trash app for the amount of time it has been on the market. Super buggy sometimes skips episodes on podcasts by itself or just stops audio completely to add to that there are random crashes. The google podcasts app has been a much better alternative.
613,Cody V.,"March 4, 2020",5, Great music streaming for any genre you're in the mood for. Even have podcasts for those who like those. Very short commercials; nothing like normal radio unless you're listening to an actual radio station on the go.
614,Lorraine Martin,"March 3, 2020",5," Thank you iHeart radio so much. I live in a city that once had a jazz station until the early 2000's, we don't now. It's so nice to still be able to find so many jazz channels with iHeart. Thank you."
615,error,"March 3, 2020",2, It'd be a perfect app if it didn't PAUSE randomly and not continue playing unless I close and reopen the app. Very annnoying to deal with when on a long drive somewhere and it just cuts off for no reason despite having a strong connection.
616,Sunshine Krewson,"March 15, 2020",3, I really enjoy your app and one thing that would make it even better is f I could push the thumbs-up or thumbs down symbol on my phone when it's vertical instead of only when it's horizontal. It would make things so much easier and save time. üòä Thank you!
617,john lykins,"March 29, 2020",4," Still learning in's and outs of it. (Hard for us old boomers, ya know üòè) I keep getting a high pitched strange ""UFO"" sound/alert that says it's emitting from 'Fox'/iheart' app. Have to find out how to stop that is annoying as hell."
618,Denise Domascieno,"March 28, 2020",5," I love iHeartRadio mobile app. So easy to listen to what I want to hear, making a station from a song , artist or genre is so easy."
619,William Merry,"April 18, 2020",5, Awesome songs and cool stations to lesson to when you want to get away from everyone
620,Frootloop the Chatot,"April 3, 2020",1, I can't remove my account no matter what I do and their Help section doesn't provide jack-diddly-squat on how to remove it. I haven't needed the app for years and no matter what I do I still get emails that I don't want because it acts like my account is still active.
621,Marsha Thompson,"April 11, 2020",5, So much better and easier than Sirius Radio. Thankyou Iheartradio. Marsha Thompson Okla. Formerly from Ca.
622,Nicholas Suttles,"April 10, 2020",1, App is terrible. It freezes up about every 5 minutes and you have to stop and hit play again. Tune In doesn't do that so I know it's not on my end.
623,Chris Bonafield,"April 13, 2020",5," It's nice, you can pick your genre based on your mood or preference. Makes the work day go quicker."
624,Kevin Moulin,"April 21, 2020",5, Fantastic. Can't get my Sirius to play while working in the yard but this app does
625,Albert Zlenka,"April 18, 2020",5, Works great can listen to radio stations from out of my area for free
626,Chris Haas,"April 15, 2020",5, Has always been reliable for radio but I've even replaced Google podcast with iHeartRadio.
627,Carol Krumpter,"February 18, 2020",1, Was working great then I updated it and it constantly cuts off. I have cleared the cache and have further reached out to you with zero response. The app still cuts off after a few minutes since the update and it is constant.
628,Beverly Farris,"February 5, 2020",5, I just started using iheartradio on my phone. The interface between my phone and TV is amazing. And I love being able to easily set up my station with the thumbs up and down. It is so much better than Pandora. Thanks!
629,Adam Lyons,"February 18, 2020",3," Controls are not user friendly. I think that once an episode is finished, it should go to the next one in line...not jump to the newest release. This, and a few other things, would make it so much easier to navigate."
630,Brandon Stout,"February 26, 2020",2, App sucks. Cuts out and stops playing three to for times for a 3 hour pod cast. Have to restart the whole app and it doesn't save the spot it cuts out. Only gets a second star because its the only way to listen to the podcast.
631,Justin Mappin,"March 4, 2020",4," ***Deleted/Re-installed, App works fine*** Google pixel 3, app crashes every couple minutes, and audio stops randomly. Used to be good, hard to justify listening to the repetitive commercials on an app that doesn't work properly"
632,Michael Stenger,"March 6, 2020",2," Horrible unless you pay. The free version use to have commercials, but they were fairly unobtrusive.. Now they pop on in the middle of the news or during a song, and sometimes an Ad, them 2 minutes of radio, then another Ad."
633,Colby Harris,"March 20, 2020",5, The only thing that I do not like is that it sometimes stops broadcasting after a few minutes once your screen turns itself off. I wish it would stay on until I actually leave/close the app.
634,Antonio Chambers,"March 17, 2020",5, Very good app easy to use. So many stations and music and podcasts to listen to so many options from all over the USA and the music is crystal clear and i can hear local stations and talk shows in my city wherever I go very good app and love the playlists and can create your own library of music
635,David Russo,"March 18, 2020",4," Great options and free, I believe in free airwaves let the advertisements run. Sometimes it's something I like, need or didn't know about... People it is free! I only gave 4 stars because of the delay, I never win contests because of that reason."
636,Lee Peace,"March 11, 2020",1," All tracks, music and podcasts are constantly pausing itself every couple of minutes. It's not because of buffering either. It's been going on for a while. It's either pausing it or closing out the app all together"
637,Joe Eschman,"March 22, 2020",3, They play the same songs over and over. Purchased upgrade think I'd get more variety. I didn't. Same songs as before. But at least the songs don't suck. They play Bohemian Rapsody too damn much.
638,Jason N,"March 29, 2020",3," Works very well in most regards, but you can't download podcasts to your SD card. I have an enormous SD card but very little internal storage. What is the purpose of an SD card if you're not allowed to use it?"
639,Richard Rollo,"April 3, 2020",4, Sometimes it locks up and the station doesn't have sound. A little slow too. But sounds great and I can listen to what I like.
640,Brandon Shimpa,"April 9, 2020",2," Constantly pausing and losing connection when connected to wifi. No its not my wifi messing up. When I turn wifi off then it works flawlessly, but of course then drains my data."
641,Anna Freeman,"April 16, 2020",1, It's annoying that I cant access download podcasts in the app while I am offline. What is the point of downloading them?
642,Tim Lindsey,"April 24, 2020",5," The only app that reliably sinks between mobile, PC and auto."
643,Heidi Fralick,"March 22, 2020",5, I absolutely love my iheart!!!! I have over 300 songs in my playlist and I'm searching for more!!!! I dnt have to listen to ads!! All I have to do is plug in and im loving it!!!
644,Benny Dean,"February 21, 2020",3," One day of using this app and I'm requested to answer the survey about IHeart radio app. How can I do that? So I give response a 3. The Iheart radio has options beyond compare with any other app. Give the Iheart radio a try, you'll like it."
645,Jay Holmes,"February 21, 2020",1," This app doesn't let you turn down the volume of the ads!!! I've never seen something so intrusive. A bold move by the developers, and worth a one star rating and an uninstall. A sincere F you to these guys."
646,Rob Garascia,"February 3, 2020",4, This app is really useful for listening to radio stations when a radio is unavailable. The only negative is that not all the local stations are available. This is probably not the fault of I Heart Radio.
647,effoffinc Incorporated,"February 13, 2020",5," Just a damn good music radio app. I like that I can pick a song or artist and not only will it play what I am looking for, but also plays songs and artist that are similar to what I like listening to. Two thumbs up!!"
648,Tammy Johnson,"February 22, 2020",5, It's not fair that the only way you can skip is if you subscribe and not everyone can afford or they get hacked like myself in dispute with my bank so please can you help people who need it please and thank you. By the way I love this game it's fun challenging and addicting
649,Michael Thompson,"February 26, 2020",5," Plays all the music I grew up listening to, great random list, and tons of podcast choices! I definitely highly recommend anyone looking for an excellent music app whatever your needs may be! Perfect for all my needs!"
650,Kelly Van Vliet,"February 13, 2020",1, Used to perform flawlessly. In recent months has stopped playing without interruption. I've uninstalled & reinstalled without improved performance. Stop pushing for upgrade until you get basic product to work.
651,Justin C.,"March 8, 2020",3," Will give 5 stars when the radio plays all night. Been using for over a year, last two or three weeks it stops about 6 times a night. It shows it's playing but nothing makes any music come back except restarting app."
652,Scott Phelps,"March 22, 2020",5, Upgrading was probably a better ideato make it easier to listen to the things that won't play unless you're at all access I just have to figure out how to do the podcasts on my TV now all the way awesome can't wait to use it on the workout
653,Carleton Copp,"March 31, 2020",2, They have ads you can't adjust volume or turn off no mater what except to remove your battery or listen to the blast for 30 secs. And the icon looks like a sexual act.
654,Darmesha Robinson,"April 10, 2020",4, Easy to use and they have all my favorite podcasts!
655,mike onite,"April 13, 2020",5, Amazing but HAY check Mikey and Bob they are more hilarious than any radio station I ever checked with.
656,Reginald Wilson,"April 11, 2020",5," live outside of the city (Chi) and can't get any RB stations. Thanks to iheart radio I can listen to several RB,hip-hop and gospel stations with no static. I even get to listen to my nephew who's a radio personality in Alabama."
657,Ju K,"April 8, 2020",5, I love this I heart radio! Absolutely the best to be listening to what ever station you wish or listen to a particular artist/ songs... very simple and easy to access MUSICüòòüòé
658,lindsey klee,"April 2, 2020",4, I only wish it would give the option to break the archived episodes of a show into chunks of 100 or possibly by year rather than me going to the beginning from like 2009 and having to scroll 75 times to get to 2012
659,Katie Taylor,"April 20, 2020",4," Had no problems with app, loads of stations to pick from"
660,Brett Fraser,"April 23, 2020",5, Great app lots of variety works well no problems. Good searchable.
661,Kevin Buchanan,"April 20, 2020",5, Use it everyday to listen to the two radio stations I tune into.
662,Mandy Williams,"April 15, 2020",5, Love how they have a southern gospel station... only station I listen too. Thanks IHeart radio!
663,Patrice Wimbley,"April 16, 2020",4," only wish I could listen to my saved songs without having to pay an wish could play the song put in , wished that the lyrics was on the screen also other than that it's great,wish had more offers."

666,Raven Dickerson,"April 7, 2020",5, The radio station that I to helps me fall asleep because I can't fall asleep without sound. It's very useful if you wanna listen to 80s music to üòä
667,JayBob Red,"April 14, 2020",5," Love the southern gospel station WGUS, i heart country classics, and iheart country 90's! Thanks iheart for these stations!"
668,Eric C,"February 28, 2020",1," I like to listen to talk radio. Every 90 seconds or so, the talk is interrupted midsentence for a commercial. I don't mind the occasional interruption, but this app is horrible. Uninstalling."
669,Chris Lewis,"February 27, 2020",2," Experiencing super slow playback when listening to podcasts - one episode will play fine, the next will play 5x slower...and adjusting the playback speed has no effect. It's totally random and happens every day."
670,LRJ,"February 24, 2020",3," Had it about a week and just not impressed. Maybe with more time it will grow on me, but I prefer another music application (one that has its own drawbacks though, which is why I downloaded this app)."
671,Tracey Vogelsang,"March 15, 2020",1," Lately, this app has become very unreliable. I've been using this service for over a decade and have only recently gotten frustrated because it will play for a time and then refuse to load more songs."
672,Sammy Bailey,"April 14, 2020",5, Love the Music !! I am so enjoying what I can Choose !! Been the Best . Very Relaxing ' while I'm having a Shower !! Simply great Thank You xo

674,Walter Stilwell,"April 3, 2020",1," Cuts out, stops mid play to accusing you of recording your paid machine encrypted music file location so when it Jack's up it's just a paper weight unlike Pandora, Spotify Amazon. Buckle and dime you to death."
675,Nathan Cha,"April 10, 2020",5, This is the best raidio app ever! So much playlists. Very very nice! I love it.
676,Hiram Beard,"April 12, 2020",5, I love the slow jams station and just about anything i want too listen too.
677,The Oatmanite,"April 5, 2020",5," It's good I don't know if it's me but when I try to play a game with no sound this app stops working , it might be me I don't have really good internet most of the time ."
678,Cody Watson,"April 13, 2020",5, FM radio stations coming in on your radio poorly? IHeaetRadio is for you. Love podcast? IHeartRadio is for you. Love this app cause I can listen to almost any radio station I used to listen to anywhere.
679,Bill Pekkanen,"April 13, 2020",5, It plays all the song I like. The few that I don't like I give it a thumbs down then skip to the next one.

688,A Google user,"February 25, 2020",1," Was a good way to listen to music until you decided to get political and run the worthless Bloombergs ads, and every 10 minutes no less. It's funny that no one else ads are ever played, but none should be at all."
689,Darryl Whitmore,"March 3, 2020",2," I only listen to podcasts, and now (apparently after an update?) when I open the app it starts playing some music station, which I don't want to hear and I must immediately turn off while I navigate to my podcast. Why do you assault me with this and not allow it to be configured off?"
690,Daisy Colorado,"March 9, 2020",5," Everytime I look for a radio app to play my local station this is the one I go back to. Finding stations is easy and the content is cool, you can see what's playing or recently played to avoid hearing ads or talk shows like I do. Overall good app."
691,George R.,"March 26, 2020",3," Its free, I like it but the sound is a bit echoey and its is not live like on my galaxy s7 edge that has a fm radio which is live, but I have a note 10+ and no headphones jack that means no more fm radio, can you please make it live like on fm radio"
692,Georgette Nichols,"March 27, 2020",3, I still enjoy the music....when it plays. I can't even go up the block without it cutting off. Sit in the house and it cuts off then starts another song. Wow. Ridiculous.
693,Brian Andrews,"April 2, 2020",5," Love it but I really wish I could get 106.5 fm here in mobile , al sports and news talk I guess I'm going to have to find me a new app that does pick it up!"

700,Frank Beachel,"March 6, 2020",5," Outstanding performance, finding everything and more. Have it on all my electronics and even got the upgrade after only about a month of use. Additionally I rarely use my old music list anymore because I use my iheartradio so much. LOVE IT."
701,D L,"February 16, 2020",1, Garbage. Data theft. It doesn't allow you to actually turn off notifications and location. I've turned them off and when analyzing the app it still uses those permissions. Shame on IHeart!
702,Chad Cody,"February 21, 2020",4, Always stops and doesn't play the last 3 to 4 seconds of a song I have to return to my phone to hit play for it to resume or go to the next song most times I have to use a skip to get it to resume.
703,Chris Noel,"February 26, 2020",1," Your Facebook presence really lacks. Has anyone ever looked at the conservative circus posts? The headline is the same redundant ""listen to the conservative circus with James T Harris "" then the actual content description is half a name. Ridiculous. I don't know if I am interested or not based on ha...Full ReviewYour Facebook presence really lacks. Has anyone ever looked at the conservative circus posts? The headline is the same redundant ""listen to the conservative circus with James T Harris "" then the actual content description is half a name. Ridiculous. I don't know if I am interested or not based on half a word or name. Its like a gameshow, pick door number one.. what content do we have here! Such a waste of time.. I just dont click on it because of the app bootup time. Sucks actually."
704,Sam H,"March 5, 2020",2," Used to work beautifully. Now, it cuts off randomly ALL THE TIME. Whatever they did... it's now a JUNK app. I'm looking for something better. Something that actually works."
705,Isabel P Garcia,"March 18, 2020",1, It was great! Till a few days ago. Can someone please tell me why lately it turns off by itself? Ive had all access for over a year and just recently ir turns off buy itself. Why?

707,Jim F,"March 25, 2020",1, I do not want to subscribe to iHeart Radio yet somehow I am now on some kind of automatic payment plan. Very difficult to cancel or find out what is going on. Probably some kind of fine print or miscue. Beware.
708,Joneice Fudge,"March 24, 2020",1, Omg! I tried updating this app over and over! I play my music when I get up for work it will literally play 2 songs then completely stop working ! I had to switch over to pandora I've tried everything iheart isn't it anymore.
709,Binh Nguyen,"March 25, 2020",2," Only 2 stars because this app got very late latency. I haven't measured but maybe 2 minutes latency. When I hear a competition on the radio and want to call in, the competition is already finished."
710,Stephanie Vogel,"March 25, 2020",3," Some podcasts are not playing. When I choose an episode and hit play the episode title flips through several episodes and never starts. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling. That didn't solve the problem. Now, the app wont open at all."
711,crh325,"March 29, 2020",1, Downloaded the app so that I could hopefully listen to the iheart living room concert but after searching for over half an hour and still haven't found it now I am giving up. What's the point in having something like this say it's on the app but not have it searchable.
712,Tony Lucas,"March 31, 2020",2," The Mix tend to play the same artists continually , eg Prince, Huey Lewis , Pat Benetar I no repeat work week would be great because depending on the playlist I hear the same songs each day."
713,june kreis,"April 1, 2020",5," Its wonderful to hear stories that can touch your heart. I am always amazed at how people can tell their stories and bring out so much emotion in me, whether its laughter or tears or just make you think. I truly love hearing all of them. Thank you"

No app should have control over a phone Bluetooth connection...Full ReviewWhat app sucks more than any app has ever sucked before? This one's definitely creeping in on the top 10. When I close the app , it disconnects my phone from its Bluetooth connection. and when I open any other app up, it plays on my phone. No app should have control over a phone Bluetooth connection. I shouldn't have to search and reconnect the Bluetooth after closing your app."
722,Amanda Perrotta,"February 5, 2020",3," With the latest update, I can no longer continue to play music in the background after closing out my apps and this is frustrating. Also, the music keeps stopping in the middle of songs."

724,Jennifer West,"February 6, 2020",4, It a awesome app i reccomend getting it bur the only thing that bothered me is you have to subscibe to play just a song instead of a station. Btw if you get the app listen to why dont we. But ither than that it is a amazing app.
725,Becky Pember,"February 17, 2020",5," AM radio has poor signal quality on all of my radios at home. Using the iHeartRadio app enables me to hear my favorite AM talk radio with crystal clarity!! Rush, Hannity, and James have never sounded better!!"

Please upload 1130 wisn shows quicker. They used to be available within min after a show before moving to iheart Thanks.
740,Kody Leno,"February 29, 2020",1," Terrible app for podcasts. Randomly stalls on the podcast, then forgets where you are. Any time you reopen the app you have to start the podcast over, if it will load at all. Awful, realistically 0 stars."

742,Debbie Voliva,"March 17, 2020",5, Love this App! They play all my favorite songs and even get to listen to live radio stations. It doesn't crash or buffer at all. Streaming is easy and great to listen to. I wouldn't have any other music app.

748,Rusty Rider,"March 19, 2020",4," Absolutely fantastic podcasts!!! I just wish it would work better on Xbox, and Roku. If I could search, and play podcasts, on Xbox/Roku, I'd given 5 stars!!!!"
749,Corey Kaye,"February 6, 2020",2, Latest update now requires me to click a station then click another play button. Genius move to add a second unnecessary step. This is especially helpful when I'm driving and now have to look at the phone to do this.
750,Ldy Ravyn,"February 27, 2020",5, I just love being able to have constant music in my bluetooth headphones and I just ABSOLUTELY LOVE your choice of songs. I have had no problems. Thanks and have an awesome day üôÇ‚úåü§üüíú

Yes I played hot I heart, I also had spotify and paradox too. I paid for spotify also. Never paid for paradox, but I had them first for about five years. I never loved paradox it seem to mainstream, but I like them more than Iheart which I paid for just to check them out and it's all about the money and super mainstream and they bully themselves into everything even my smart car and I hate iheart. Hehehe I heart is for young peeps. Peace out"
756,Thomas Chrysler,"March 10, 2020",2," Cannot advance the song remotely. Bluetooth headphones...nope. Car Bluetooth...nope. If I clear the cache then it works, but I shouldn't have to do that daily to maintain app functionality."
757,John A,"March 26, 2020",5," I was frustrated that this app doesn't always work when I'm outside of the country. The developer replied to my post immediately. Apparently the app is only available inside the US which I did not know. Anyway, thanks for the quick response!"
758,Weston,"March 27, 2020",4," I dig it so far, better than Pandora, my favorite station is out of Detroit called ""Smells like the 90s"" but there are tons to choose from."

760,Mikey Stokes,"April 9, 2020",5, Easy to navigate and great selection of music
761,Rebecca Sage,"April 4, 2020",5, I really only listen to one radio station on this app and the connection is usually more reliable than the radio station's app.
762,Guy Allison,"April 19, 2020",5, I like the varaity the premium version is great can listen to any alblum you want with no interuptions
763,wish you knew,"April 20, 2020",5, I use the waze app for work and iHeartRadio is the perfect pairing for it

765,Daniel Bradford,"April 5, 2020",1, Well since last update now it only plays a couple of hours and then just stops. No crash or close. According to the app its still running it just stops playing music.
766,A Google user,"February 18, 2020",5," Sound quality is great for casual listening. Lately, each song is ending by breaking up as though signal is weak and then the next song is overlapping the previous one as if on a DJ Fader control but, it begins perfectly."
767,Tricia Ensign,"February 15, 2020",5, Love the songs they shuffle through. Matches perfectly with the band i pick! Sleeping with Sirens has got sn AMAZING new album out. The 10$ deal for unlimited skips and listening to ANY song is üíØ percent worth the money
768,Joshua Sturgill,"February 9, 2020",5," Love iheart radio, plays all my favorite songs and interduses me to some new bands. Great way to listen to music. Have used it for a long time and I don't see that changing... Keep up the great work iheart."
769,Kelly C,"February 17, 2020",2, Ads suck and you can't get rid of them did forbid you hit one then a page pops-up that you then have to close Music just starts playing also It would be a much better app if it didn't have nearly as many ads otherwise it's just cluttered
770,rioxis sardonis,"February 27, 2020",1, Having problems this week. The app is constantly stopping and if it does continue to play then it only plays a couple songs before it starts repeating the same song over and over. App that I pay for is currently sucking.
771,David Holt,"February 19, 2020",1, Can't block artists that I don't want to ever listen to. The same songs keep showing up in playlist no matter how many times I thumb them down. Developers must need to force their listeners to hear these songs to make more money.
772,Cathy Clark,"March 8, 2020",5," I am not good with artist names or song titles, but have several favorites in my library that were selected for me by one title from one artist. I love it!"

774,Whatatay T,"March 1, 2020",1, Fake app. Downloaded several podcasts. All turned out to be samples that told me to go to a web page and download their podcast player. I don't need 20 different podcast players on my phone.
775,Shelbi Brown,"March 23, 2020",1," I use the app because it's the only way for me to listen to my favorite morning show from my hometown. But I can't stand the fact that they no longer allow you to listen to the regular commercial breaks, and instead force you to listen to the same clips of the same songs over and over again."
776,Lionel Jenschke,"March 29, 2020",4," Just wish I could skip more without paying extra. The algorithms that pick the music need some work. Until that is improved, more skips would be appreciated."
777,Dennis Bauer,"April 9, 2020",3, I love the app but I don't need to be reminded of the service Everytime I login

786,David Mitchell Mitch,"April 9, 2020",4, Need to improve your WiFi signal. Music still cuts off about every 15 mins and I have too re-key my phone to get it going again.
787,Lalenalena M,"February 7, 2020",1, This so used to be great. Now all it does is cut out and stop playing. It is just frustrating. Going to have to look at something else to stream my radio.
788,Jolie Gaudet,"February 11, 2020",5," I'm very thankful for this app...now I can listen to the radio (mostly ALT 92.3 and 104.1) ...I would use my home radio, but my belongings are all boxed and scattered until I can tackle unpacking necessities and Neatly packing up the rest"

791,Julius Pioroda,"March 3, 2020",5," I like this app since it doesn't not crash Google maps or vise versa. I am able to listen to music and when there's direction instruction, the music volume goes low."
792,Jake Rice,"February 26, 2020",1," I liked this app until now. Every few minutes it's interrupting the program with commercials, causing me to miss important points and driving me crazy."
793,eric bloomstadt,"March 8, 2020",2, App works good. But app starts itself anytime I start any of my cars even when I have shut the app down when i was done. Really irritating ! I'm going to uninstall app when I get done writing this.
794,Soumittatham Chanthapanya,"March 23, 2020",4, When it works it's great. The odd time it's hard to connect to the internet. Great list of pod cast and detects local radio stations.
795,Willette Hurt,"March 24, 2020",3," This app over the last couple of months pauses after 3-4 songs, which is annoying if you're in the middle of an activity causing you to stop and restart it."
796,BjandNico Miller,"April 8, 2020",1, Ads are out of control. Constantly repeating multiple times in a 15 min period.
797,Evan Postier,"April 9, 2020",2," Very poor music selection. For example, you can select an indie-pop artist and iHeartRadio will play music from the middle east after that."

806,Gary Hilton,"March 13, 2020",1," Not very good app. I can not find the podcasts I want. I spent 15 min searching and it never found them. It clearly needs some work. BTW they are podcasts from nationally known journalist from the media outlet "" The Dispatch"""

808,donald nickens,"March 24, 2020",4, The only thing that stops a five star rating is the commercials. They come on a d are repetitive and causes us listeners to miss part of the topic that is being talked about.
809,Shawn Denardo,"March 20, 2020",5," Been only a short time, but the accessibility and walkthrough for start up, was easy and presently accommodating. Looking forward to replacing Pandora in the near future..."
810,Theresa Below,"March 24, 2020",5," I love IHeart Radio it plays all the music I love and it's not loaded down with a bunch of commercial's. There are a couple, but they are'nt a lot like you find on other radio Apps."

814,Will Harwell,"April 8, 2020",1, Stations don't play relevant music to the artist you choose. The app started out at 35.7mb it quickly changed to over 13 gigs without me ever telling it to download anything ever.
815,scott quimby,"April 16, 2020",5, Easy to navigate and the quality is fantastic!

821,Gabe Clouse,"February 3, 2020",5, Minimal commercials You can set it up so that your favorite podcasts download so you can listen if you dont have internet connection and the podcasts download automatically if you turn it on so you dont even have to remember to do it
822,Elaine Fietterer,"February 4, 2020",5, I love iHeart radio! There is always great music to listen to and I live stream it when I'm not in town to listen to it on my home stations. Keep up the great work!!
823,the calibrated cat launcher,"February 7, 2020",4," Love the app and all the choices. My only complaint is when driving, I think when I switch towers, it disconnects and upon reconnection it plays a commercial again."
824,Malcolm Andrews,"February 19, 2020",1, Can't search many radio stations. If I search for French radio stations I expect to see French radio stations not people who se name has French in it. This app in the antithesis of what an internet radio app should be.
825,Rob Douglas,"February 10, 2020",5, So glad I got this app. Can now listen to my favorite station 97.3 FM Brisbane anytime. Great in the car as I now get crystal clear reception all the time & no dropouts in Carparks. Awesome app.

Surely you would learn it's flaws if you did. How about an unmolested section listing what we saved."
827,Jaime McCarthy,"February 9, 2020",4, Good for podcasts. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it doesn't automatically start the next podcast episode when you finish one.
828,Scott Parker,"February 17, 2020",1," Terrible. Randomly quits, fails to play audio, constantly hangs, fails to load due to random errors, have to watch a 30 second ad just to change channels. Blech."
829,Bruce Hellemn,"February 16, 2020",1," This app sucks, I have heard adds on Charlie 97.1 here in Portland saying to download this app so you can listen anywhere but that station is no where on here. When I search 97.1 it gives me stations at that frequency in other cities"
830,Charmaine Marchesi,"March 8, 2020",1," Over the past few months, every time I use this app to play music it stops before the second song is finished. Super annoying and frustrating."

This week they cancelled 3 local shows and fired the whole stations staff in Des Moines IA. I've heard they have done it all over.

I listen to a certain am station when I work and I am forced to stop constantly in order to restart the station. It seems like the station is buffering.

'How could this possibly go wrong?' I thought. Then I opened it up. See, remember when they said it was free to play any song? Well, it's actually the PODCASTS that are free, not the songs. To play whatever song you want, you have to buy either Plus ($4.99 a month) or All Access ($10.99 a month). I guess I'm going back to YT."

When it actually works, it plays a lot of the same songs over & over. I don't always hear what I want. Plus, there's no way to view your song history. So, if I'm listening and want to go back to see the titles of songs I liked, there's no option for it. Honestly, the only reason I downloaded it is because I like having music at night when I sleep and that's not an option with YouTube anymore."

3115,Mike Brubaker,"January 18, 2020",1," Pretty bad. Keeps trying to show ads which causes the app to freeze. When you select a song to play, it plays something else you didn't select. When you try to pause or stop that song from playing, it intermittently keeps playing, and you have to keep pausing or stopping it."
3116,Mark Sternick,"January 18, 2020",3," Adequate music listening. Too many repeats. ""Favorites"" somehow lose favorite status sometimes. Some favorites don't get replayed. I have paid subscription, so no ads! Don't use podcasts at all, so can't rate that feature. Random genre shows up sometimes in spite of favorites and genre preferences."
3117,J Low,"January 18, 2020",5, Awesome app. We live deep in a forest and have no access to active communications of any type. We are able to download music and podcasts once a month when we travel to the nearest town where wifi is available. This app is our 'entertainment.' What a great variety you offer. Thank you!
3118,Kristina Brooks,"January 23, 2020",4, This is my go-to podcast app and i love the variety. Downloads are quick and automatic and the app picks up where you left off when being opened. Minus 1 star because it does not save a reverse listening order and i have to reverse it everytime so i can listen from oldest to newest.
3119,Elizabeth Gibson,"January 3, 2020",3, You can find any song you are looking for! I do not like that your library plays the same songs over and over. You end up skipping multiple songs that have played more than 2 times in a given time period. Songs need to be shuffled better!

3235,tim vanwinkle,"November 27, 2019",5, How about putting the exit button where it used to be. thank you for that I didn't know you could get it off that way but a lot of people get aggravated when you move stuff I'm not exactly computer knowledgeable at all but thanks and iHeartRadio to me is the I best
3236,Desiree Ramirez,"November 22, 2019",2, Ugh I'm annoyed on how much this crashes on my phone and computer at work. Can't listen to a full podcast without it cutting out and then I have to start over and find where I left off. I don't even want to pay for it knowing it will still probably have the same problem.
3237,Cassaundra Bahry,"January 2, 2020",5, I love this radio app it has so many stations to choose from and I love that I also like songs which go to a station that is just my faves which I have liked.

No more static from my regular radio and I can play music that I want to hear and stations that I love. Thank you I heart radio for creating such an amazing app.
3238,Helise St. John,"January 16, 2020",3," Was really nice before it started to mess up! Starts playing two songs at once sometimes. Other times it doesn't play the song it's showing and if you skip it then it corrects itself most of the time, but in turn that uses one of your skips. Rather unfortunate."
3239,Andrew Goggio,"January 30, 2020",3, Would be great if it didn't randomly close and stop playing what you're listening to every 20-30 minutes.
3240,Solomon Dukes,"February 9, 2020",5, It good but too much ads
3241,tonya hope,"January 28, 2020",3, Sometimes I have interrupted white noise and no music. That's why i uninstalled it but i thought I'd give it another chance.

Now it constantly hangs while driving requiring me to press home key for the show to resume. Eventually the app completely hangs showing that's its playing, but isnt. Have to force stop the app."
3253,Kellee Rigdon,"December 3, 2019",2," I love having the option to use this app, and for the most part it's great. But the app constantly stops and I have to restart the station I am listening too or change apps to one that won't stop mid-play."
3254,Raynor Poehls,"December 13, 2019",2, I have given this app over a year to improve. It sucks. Not very easy to navigate. The Bluetooth connection is glitchy. It just randomly stops playing. Then constantly have adds promoting their paid service... No way.

3258,Sheldon Hart,"January 19, 2020",4," Brings in my favourite stations loud and perfectly clear! Thank you! Periodically drops the signal and I have to re-browse to the app on my phone. In all fairness, I have an a non-current app. Updating now...which may be 100% üòä"
3259,SuperBrightside1,"March 15, 2020",4, The overall sound could be more rich. A lot of music on here sounds very flat..... Even conected to a speaker.
3260,Mark Creamer,"December 27, 2019",1," The application is seesom, but the execution is horrible. Whatever watches over your connection to their lot stations will batter you with ads. It is insane. I WILL NEVER USE ROCKET LOANS... EVER (and I am in the market for a refi) because they constantly pop up as the ad du jour."
3261,Linda Evans,"January 27, 2020",1," Used to be great, now it only works for about 1 minute then shuts off for a few min, comes back up again and then after 1 min again shuts off. Over and over until it just doesn't come back on anymore."
3262,Mike Stephenson,"January 13, 2020",1," The app is difficult to manage and shutdown. Moreover, I must have subscribed to this unwittingly and have been charged $4.99 for two months and I just noticed it. I NEVER SUBSCRIBED. The app is comkng off my phone for good."

3274,Robert Villarreal,"January 6, 2020",1, The station's keep turning off. And then sometimes I'll turn back on within a few minutes. Constant. No matter whether I listen to it through Wi-Fi or my network. Very very frustrating!
3275,Thomas Reynolds,"November 25, 2019",2," Works okay. However since last update you you cannot exit this. You can close but it is still on drain battery. :( I found out how to exit on my own. The developer did answer, but it made no sense. I can only asume by their answer they no nothing about android phones."
3276,Marlene Medina,"December 17, 2019",5, I've only listened on the Iheart radio app just recently because of my new job I dont have radio anymore but... I love it! Constant music. I've noticed it keeps me going through the days sitting in an office now days. Its great!
3277,Erica L Thomas,"December 6, 2019",3," I love my iHeartRadio, but lately it has been cutting off during my mornings getting ready for work. It's not my internet connection either.

3291,Alan Brads,"November 21, 2019",5, Solid app. I listen to ESPN radio every night and it works just fine. Occasional bugs where it'll take a minute to start playing. But nothing big. Would recommend for listening to radio. Don't know much about other features
3292,Sonderer,"December 24, 2019",4," few commercials, only 2 problems I have found so far, you cannot pause commercials with headset buttons and if it sits not playing for too long the headset buttons will not allow control of the app through a locked screen like normal."
3293,james white,"December 22, 2019",4," I would give it 5 stars. When listening to podcasts I dont like the fact that it starts a new episode. When I go back to finish the other episode, it shows I've already finished it. So now I have to look at the time when I turn it off so when I go back I can find where I left off."
3294,Michael Kruckvich,"December 18, 2019",3," I love the variety of music options. I just wish the lowest volume setting were a little lower. Currently, it's still a little louder than I'm sometimes comfortable to have playing on my desk at work."
3295,Jonathan Schull,"December 19, 2019",2," I'm just about ready to Uninstall your app. It will only play the station for about 15 minutes before closing out on me. More trouble than it's worth, because I'm a driver, and can't spend time while I'm behind the wheel fussing with the app."

But, I really love that I can enjoy my favorite station 94.9""THE BULL"" even though I'm out of the state. Makes me feel closer to home, even when I'm away from home. I can save my favorite songs to a playlist while listening to my favorite D.J.'s on live radio. Hey Where's the widget??"
3297,Kevin K.,"January 19, 2020",1, I downloaded the app to listen to podcasts only available through iHeart. I'm occasionally in remote places where there is no Wi-Fi or even digital data. without both of those the iHeart app won't open on my phone and I'm unable to listen to the podcast I've had previously downloaded.
3298,Dena Reed,"January 22, 2020",5," Best way to listen to the radio at work, on my phone or home washing dishes. Love iHeartRadio but I don't want to pay for what I can listen to in my car for free.... same reason I won't have SiriusXM because of the fees. Keep it free with ads and I will continue to listen!"
3299,"Mario Sanchez,","January 30, 2020",2, Way too many rerecordings demos live and different versions of songs every version except the original versions plus you play the same songs over and over
3300,Steve Stinson,"January 28, 2020",2, Definitely has a long way to gowhat Play the song that you press on it's not f****** rocket science guys with somebody wants to listen to music and they press on the song they want it should come on not staying the same f****** song

3318,Darren Allen,"January 8, 2020",5," Good, clean sound. And it sounds good on my Bluetooth speakers. This makes my portable CD player, boom box or clock radio look like an old shoe box in the middle of the road...üòÅ"
3319,Bud Tyger,"January 21, 2020",4," I'm new to I heart but its great so far. Update a few weeks, a crazy amount of content. Impressed with the amount of Christian content available! Update : it's been a couple months, it is even better, absolutely love listening to the podcasts !"

Genius, That's simply genius!"
3321,Estefani Ormazabal,"November 26, 2019",2, Everyday around 6:20am the signal goes out and the app doesn't allow me to close. This is a glitch in the app and not my phone as this only happens when I use iheart radio and there's a pattern to the issue.
3322,Claudine Strong,"November 23, 2019",5," OMG, I've been having problems for weeks with interruptions in my service. Been so busy to remember that app needs updating from time to time. I just updated it, problem solved. Loooove the Iheartradio App!üíñüíñüíñ"
3323,Bill Fischer,"December 2, 2019",1, Difficult to exit app. Updated version is even more difficult as you need to go through extra steps to exit app. This is the only app on my Android that does not fully exit/close when you swipe to left. It is annoying to say the least.
3324,Catherine Caballero,"December 5, 2019",1, I loved this app but need to cancel for a bit and u am having the hardest time trying to do it. Once I find where the cancel option is. I will never pay will never pay for this again. Was easy to subscribe but not easy to cancel. Frustrated!!!!
3325,James Anderson,"December 7, 2019",4," Radio-waves. Best streaming radio service I've used so far. Very little buffering if any. Wide variety of choice, and materials means it has something for just about everyone."
3326,Rob Lee,"December 20, 2019",4," I think everything is excellent üëç. I can't imagine anything else more anyone could want. The only thing is that the 90 s station seems to skip and sometimes stop, like it's a shot. So I think that is something for the developers to take care of."
3327,Galaxy Kitty,"January 6, 2020",5," So good! :D It's as good as Spotify but Spotify is still better, but, still, I'm rating this 5 stars. Yay! I'mma keep listening to the radio and music from your app. Once again, rated 5 stars."
3328,Xiulani 4U,"January 14, 2020",4, I'll give it a four because it really is a good app. But the fact you have to pay for certain things is a little hard to deal with. What about the young teenagers who want to listen to music but don't have any money... Overall it's still a great app.
3329,M Z,"January 22, 2020",5," Lots of choices for radio. That's primarily what I use if for. I wish it had a more friendly safe driving mode with fewer options and bigger buttons. Other than that, its great."
3330,Peter Aldrich,"January 22, 2020",2, While listening to this app with earbuds in the volume increases substantially when a commercial comes on. You need to fix this . It feels painful when this happens . There is no reason to blast my ear drums with a loud commercial.
3331,Jim Booth,"January 23, 2020",3, It's good but it's to bad it will only allow one device the upgrade and not your account instead. Plus it should be cheaper than the price they are asking for. It's not like we can burn and store the music on a CD.
3332,Miranda de Haan,"January 19, 2020",4," I like the variety. It would be nice, though, to be able to search for music by title or type. For example, I really enjoy showtunes and musicals, so I would love to be able to search for the specific songs I like, the title of a movie or play, and maybe by the composer."
3333,Karen Hollingsworth,"January 25, 2020",3," Iheart used to be awesome, however it shuts off by itself all the time. Been going on for a few months now and I'm getting really sick of it! If it doesn't get worked out soon I'm going to cancel my prescription and go with another music provider"

3335,Christin Morrison,"January 30, 2020",5, Love the ability to be able to make my own play list based on specific artist or similar.
3336,Wesley Northcutt,"January 22, 2020",4, My only gripe is the fact that I listen to all my songs at once in a long playlist and have to constantly scroll back through all the songs to get back to where I was a option to skip to a letter to make that faster would be awesome
3337,Diane Adams,"February 6, 2020",5," I absolutely Love music, and I heart radio delivers."
3338,Skip Slatton,"March 17, 2020",4, Easy to use but the stream drops out sometjmes.

3345,Sevillain SullyVybez,"February 11, 2020",5, I've had it for months now and it's nice! Wide variety of music
3346,Daddioshiamiagi-san ',"December 2, 2019",3," Overall its a great app. Lots of great music choices. My only issue is that it will just stop playing for awhile, then start again. As soon as it starts doing that, it continually does it."
3347,AJ C,"December 30, 2019",4, Good streaming music. Plays both familiar and introduces you to knew similar music. Areas for improvement: Sometimes it stops playing music for no known reason and even leaving and coming back doesn't fix. I haven't found an option to always self select radio versions
3348,Javon Ransomed,"December 18, 2019",3," Live streams from radio stations pause very frequently for 30 sec. to a few minutes at a time regardless of streaming over wifi or cellular data, both with strong signals. Absent of that, the app is solid."
3349,Bobby Planitzer,"December 18, 2019",5," It's a great app for listening to different stations around the country. I also get to listen to Mikey and Bob pod cast from 96.1 kiss fm everyday, so that's a huge plus in my book!"
3350,Anissa Banks,"February 8, 2020",5, Great music helps the day pass quicket
3351,Paige Moore,"January 9, 2020",5, Love love love. Only thing I wish I could change is the order in which the podcasts are played. It should start with the oldest to the newest but that's MY opinion. Love the app so much!
3352,Chris Elliott,"January 16, 2020",4," I use this app all day to stream radio stations. My one issue with it is when my phone switches from wifi to 4g (and vice versa) or from one wifi network to another the stream stops. I then have to open the app, tap stop and the tap play again to get it going."
3353,James Clapsaddle,"January 20, 2020",4, I enjoy the free version of this app. I did a free subscription weekend back in October of 2019 and like it as well. I am okay with the free version for now. I do not have really much problems with the app. Works good with Android auto.
3354,Jerry Ashburn,"January 2, 2020",3, i would have rated it a 5 but for the past few months the volume will not go high enough. All my volume settings are at max(S7 Samsung phone)-This problem just started a couple of months ago and was fine before.
3355,John Donahue,"January 7, 2020",5, This is a very good app. I use the free version and I have had zero issues out of it and I listen to music everyday. There are not nearly as many ads as other music streaming apps which is great!
3356,Selena's playlist Gonzaaalez,"January 27, 2020",5, Music is my life and this has really helped me come up with ways to come up with my own beats. Not the best at it but definitely better than when I first started.
3357,L Dar,"January 7, 2020",2," Poor functionality and consistency issues. App turns radio station on and off frequently while listening, chock full of commercials and frequently is unresponsive in the drop-down notifications menu of my phone. Once I find a better app, this one will be deleted."
3358,Monique Jackson,"January 28, 2020",5, I love listening to iHeart Radio because i can listen to different radio stations or podcasts. It also saves my favorites.

3360,James McHorris,"January 16, 2020",5, I love this app but It likes to lag and buffer alot. not alot of the music from particular artists that I would want to have on here or you would though would be on here. Application likes to randomly closes its self down while you are listening to music
3361,Colton Watson,"February 3, 2020",1, Cant even download. I downloaded pandora because this wont even download from the play store. Did all play store trouble shooting and comes down to this app being the only one i cant download.
3362,Ashanti Riesssn,"March 4, 2020",5, This app is great you can listen to your favorite music and song's it's truly amazing

3369,Col Pfingst,"February 12, 2020",5, Great but Brisbane stations too much talk
3370,Countess Lovelace,"December 8, 2019",4, Issues with alarm and time zone fixed. Thanks iHeartRadio. But I have been informed that there is no way to turn off vibration on alarm. App is better but still some inconsistencies like it stops working for no apparent reason.
3371,Debra Hering,"December 13, 2019",1, It constantly stops. I have loved this app for years to listen to my talk radio during the day but it runs for 5 minutes and stops. Have to exit and go back in only to have it happen again. I give up. What happened to this great app?
3372,jennifer b,"December 30, 2019",3, Sound app. Lots of commercials and at 1eird times but that is why you get for free and cannot complain. I catch all of my sports radio here and listen to it at work. Multiple stations including podcasts.
3373,yuyu123100,"December 19, 2019",2, This all is not as practical as others. Maybe I'm used to other apps but there are features that i do not like. At least podcasts are uploaded in a timely manner as compared to others.
3374,Wyatt tots,"December 23, 2019",5, Base app was amazing years ago when I first checked it out. But I moved back to what I was use to using (youtube). Came back after a friend showed me they had better playlists since the last time i used app. It's very good and high recommended.
3375,Kevin Gibbson,"December 19, 2019",5, I love a iHeartRadio the mix of music and everything. I just wish that when I went back to the app after pausing or after phone call it would play the same song. How do I fix this problem?
3376,ShaCoria Martin,"December 5, 2019",5, Better than any other radio station app. I don't have to have head phones plugged in to listen to the stations. I can listen to the music out loud. Great experience. Other music options as well.
3377,Tom Randall,"December 21, 2019",1," I was a former listener for 9 years, but the last upgrade you removed the exit button! Could not turn off! Only stop while iheartmedia still used battery power and memory in the background! Had to uninstall your app!"
3378,Curtis Mills,"January 18, 2020",5, Use this app in house and car very rare to use FM - AM any more and it is Free unless you want the extra features like download and personalize a play list but will save your entries so it's simple to get back to your favorite stations or artists been using for over a year now
3379,Russell Epp,"January 18, 2020",5," I've been able to find 99% of the music I've searched for, I'd say that's pretty amazing considering I like a very wide variety of music that you can't find most places. Been using iheart radio for many yrs now and love it!"
3380,Kimya Gee,"January 17, 2020",3, Really like this app because I can listen to the radio at work. But the app started crashing randomly a couple months ago and its great frustrating to have to restart it several times a day. Hope they find a way to fix it.
3381,Michael Campagna,"December 21, 2019",5, First came Sirius and I thought radio was over then there was HD radio. What a disappointment! Then out of left field comes iheartradio! I'm from multiple state and to hear all my favorite stations in one place! Hats off to you iheart! 100% worth the look.
3382,Kim Walton,"January 23, 2020",5, iHeart radio is the only app I use for music. I like a lot of different types of music and I can always count on finding just the right station to match my mood. Thanks iHeart Radio!
3383,Jhenane Joseph,"January 21, 2020",5, Great!! So excited for iheart radio. Boston removed The Breakfast Club from the radio which was upsetting. Iheart radio gives us the option to listen to different stations from different states. Now I only use iHeart to listen to anything.
3384,Justin Jacob,"January 29, 2020",3, Good but plays a lot of songs over and over when there is such a vast amount out there
3385,Journey to MSN-A with Ashley W.,"February 1, 2020",5, All of my favorite crime podcasts are in one spot!!
3386,Sebastian Alejandro Araque Vera,"January 22, 2020",4, I like this app because I'm a sports nut. When I can't watch tv because I'm busy in college; I just plug my head phones and listen to the am radio to hear my LA Clippers or Galaxy play in english or spanish. I don't like all the ads though. Me gusta que el app tiene la stationes en espa√±ol.
3387,Cara Benge,"February 2, 2020",5, I will always choose iHeartRadio over any other music app

3402,Raymond Mah,"January 16, 2020",5," i am changing my rating from 5 to 1 star. for whatever reason i can't change my saved stations anymore. for example i can't change from 80s to 90s. (only in Android Auto, phone is fine) Thanks for helping with my problem, 9.5.1 solved my issue."
3403,RJ,"November 29, 2019",3," Really enjoy the content; however, navigating saved stations requires some patience. How do you expect people to change stations while driving without ending up in the ditch? Please improve navigation & selection of saved stations/podcasts. Thanks!"
3404,T. Jason Mitchell,"December 5, 2019",5," Easy to use, can play in the background while I'm using other apps. Thumbs up a song to hear it more, and thumbs down removed from my play list. And it doesn't drain my battery the way other music apps do. I LOVE IT!"
3405,Chance Mackey,"December 18, 2019",3, Not bad but just need something to play music. Might keep for a little bit tell I find a better app. Definitely not going to give money to maybe find the music I want to listen to.
3406,Jasin Graham,"January 13, 2020",5, Love it you can go and do other things on your phone while music is playing and it won't shut down. There are a few ads but not much the worst part about the ads is it seems to be the same one all day.
3407,Renee Schuyler,"January 13, 2020",5," Just downloaded and opened this app. So far I like the local stations options. Hoping they play well. In response: I did know there are podcasts available, thank you. Really enjoying the music!"

3409,Evan Green,"January 18, 2020",3," Some glitches, well maybe not a glitch but something thst bothers me with podcasts where it autoplays to the most recent after i finish a podcast halfway through the list from months ago. Wish it would just continue down the list."
3410,William Hannah,"January 29, 2020",5, Love this station. Love that I can turn it on and listen to songs I enjoy while doing Anything/Everything without paying Anything. Unlike other services.
3411,Nicole Stone,"January 12, 2020",3, Love the app but there is an AD every time I choose a station or press a button just way too many ADs i see the same AD at least 3 times a day and probably see about 7 ads a day that play for 15 seconds each before you can do anything :(
3412,Bryce Roscoe,"January 31, 2020",5, Been a subscriber for over a year and have not been disappointed! Love the service and highly recommend it over others.

3429,ricardo alvee,"December 20, 2019",1," Ads ads ads, not just on the screen and as soon as you click on anything pop up videos üò°try streaming the app and the station from the web and you'll note the added iheart radio commercials playing at the SAME TIME the stations are."
3430,Gomez Johnson,"January 16, 2020",4, My number one music choice right behind YouTube. Although I pay for the full subscription some options still aren't available. That's why i gave a 4 star. But all other features are awesome.
3431,Juanita Ihaia,"January 25, 2020",5, Sound is clear. I live in a rural area and don't always have access to local radio stations ... This app helped when the fires were at there worst... Thanks for this app...

3450,Dominique Weir,"November 26, 2019",1, App stops playing minutes even seconds after you start listening. Happens every day that I listen to it. Have to start it again lots within the first 10 minutes of listening. Otherwise app is good for listening to.
3451,Jean Boardman,"January 10, 2020",2," The app was working fine until this morning. This morning it literally won't play any music, it starts a song and then skip to the next. Now it won't load any song whatsoever and just keep skipping to the next song."
3452,Hari Singh,"January 20, 2020",5, Love the fact that I can listen to radio stations from the U.S as the Canadian radio stations live to just repeat same stuff all day and no real good talk shows. Not to mention I now have access to lot of podcasts

3454,john payne,"December 18, 2019",1, I'm leaving! Tired of your signal cutting out every few minutes and having to reinitiate a new connection. Can't listen for more than 45 seconds without interuption. Bye!
3455,SB,"December 31, 2019",1, Since november every song is followed by a commercial. All star wars related. So annoying and ruins the experience of listening to the music. Makes me want to switch back to pandora.
3456,Shelton Styles,"January 26, 2020",3," The best way to listen to your favorite radio stations on the go, but the main problem is that it continues to stop itself in every 3rd song. They need to definitely fix that pronto."

3476,Angelfox 2323,"December 23, 2019",4, I love how i can sometimes listen to my music but what makes it drop it down to a four star is cause they keep trying to make me buy the access pack for $5 and only for a month! It gets me angry when i can't listen to some of my music...
3477,Michele M Sepeda,"December 23, 2019",4," I really like the iHeart app. I just wish they would play more songs from any generia. There are tons of songs that don't get played, from all areas of music, just a suggestion more variety please."

3530,Aaron Patterson,"January 23, 2020",5, Great App... This may be my #1 music app ever. I listen to the music on this app everyday. Alarm set to wake me up. I can't find a single thing wrong.
3531,Bobby Wells,"February 23, 2020",5," It's entertaining and easy to use, I love it."
3532,Suzanne Peloquin,"April 17, 2020",5, Love having radio station choices.
3533,Callum Brannen,"December 7, 2019",1," Crashes all the time. Can't access downloaded podcast without a data connection, which defeats the purpose of dowloding. Switching to something else for my podcast needs."
3534,Sarah Allen,"December 25, 2019",5," I love listening to my podcasts, I actually prefer it to Spotify for that purpose. The radio function could use some work though, I would like to listen to my local radio more than anything."
3535,Two Gacha Frens,"December 31, 2019",5," Man, I love this app! I make Branch comics a lot and I always wished Branch had music. Since this app crosses over others, I can pretend I'm in a cheesy music video like Tabbes, minus serenading a toilet."
3536,Deanna McKenzie,"January 7, 2020",1," The app is always stopping. Every single time I listen to something on the radio, doesn't matter the station, it always stops playing and I have to open my phone to relaunch the app. Most annoying."
3537,alby marz,"December 21, 2019",4, Expansive content. Admirable stance on free speech and the access to it. Relaxed user experience. Lacks personalization. Player functions and searching should be easier.
3538,Yolanda Cannon,"January 15, 2020",4, I had to search and download a couple of radio stations due to the fact that heart doesn't offer some fm channels in their list of radio stations choices.... The start up at times is slow .
3539,JoAnn Stump,"January 22, 2020",5, I love Being able to listen to the radio and when the phone rings I can answer and not have to worry about turning the radio down and turning it back up when I am done. I also like I can listen to any type of music depending on my mood.
3540,tom tyloch,"January 23, 2020",4," My only problem is that when your listening to a series of podcasts the autoplay goes from newest to oldest so you have to select each title as it goes or listen to your podcast in reverse order (5,4,3 ect) other that that I love it"
3541,Michael Knight,"January 25, 2020",4, Everything works pretty well. But for some reason the Joe Rogan podcast will not play. It just jumps through all the podcasts and never plays one if you select an episode.
3542,G Maddox,"January 21, 2020",4, The beginning ads will drive you crazy. Not only do you have to listen to opening ads but the ad begins from the beginning again half way through it.
3543,micki607,"January 30, 2020",5, I love this app! I listen to music & podcasts. This is the only podcast app I use.
3544,A Google user,"February 2, 2020",5, I cant always hear exactly what I want but the variety and and limited short ads are worth it for free.

3553,walter scott,"November 29, 2019",3, Not happy with the lack of buffer usage for stops and starts. With Tunein I can pause and with buffering I can pick up where exactly where I left off. With this app I lose all that I missed. Please add that ability in settings!
3554,Sarah Stone,"March 25, 2020",5, Love the stations available!
3555,Daniel Gunter,"April 4, 2020",5, It's amazing that you can just listen to the right fav song

3557,Mike Mullinix,"November 28, 2019",2," Randomly stops for no reason, forcing you to stop what you're doing and push play, and you get the bonus feature if relistening to the same 30 second commercial you heard 3 minutes ago, why would anyone upgrade this"
3558,H N,"December 9, 2019",1, This is a terrible app. Cannot find any station. Cannot load any music genre. I can only listen to one station. Unistalled then re-installed few times but same problems. Dont waste your time.
3559,Emily McArdle,"December 27, 2019",5, LOVE this app! It's way better than Pandora and Spotify(only if u r not paying a subscription). Just a few short advertisements after a couple of songs and when u change the station u use! I dont pay premium and I still LOVE IT!
3560,Roy McGaughey,"January 3, 2020",5," Absolutely LOVE ‚ù§ I HeartRadio , whatever I'm in the mood for I can find it . Thank you for finally giving us what we want when we want it (and it didn't cause the Universe to Implode) !!!"
3561,M H,"December 22, 2019",1," This app has become terrible over the last year. Constantly crashes, it's now completely unusable... uninstalling... What is the advantage to using the app over just using it within a browser? (If any for the user)"
3562,Rick East,"December 28, 2019",3, Lots of content and functionality but often takes a day to get new podcasts on phone. Other streaming services may not have bells and whistles but more reliably.
3563,Shannon Dennis,"January 3, 2020",5, IHeart Radio rocks! I love building stations and listening to the wide variety of artists. Always seem to find a new song to ease the pain of the day...
3564,Chris Hill,"January 13, 2020",5," Really like the simplicity. Just think of a song and go. Some of the recommendations a little off, but still great app. Highly recommend."
3565,me me,"January 21, 2020",5, I enjoy the ability to hear local stations and explore other stations as well. The trial is worth taking to consider purchasing. Love this application
3566,Taylor Moore,"December 29, 2019",4, I find this app really convenient when I can't decide what I want to play. It's something I can easily use while doing chores and it provides me with a lot of options that I didn't realize it had before. Would definitely recommend this app!

3568,Mark Freiberg,"January 15, 2020",1, GARBAGE!! This thing gets worse with every update. It's the only streaming app I have that pauses every time my screen goes dark. It's not my settings - I've checked them all. Uninstalling.
3569,Dakota Logan,"March 16, 2020",5, I like iHeartRadio radio because it has all the songs I like to listen too

3578,A Google user,"December 23, 2019",5, Appreciate this app very much. Listening to the radio while away from home or car. iHeartRadio makes it simple! Best source for Smooth Jazz stations and Podcasts too. Thank you iHeartRadio staff for this great gift.
3579,A Google user,"January 8, 2020",4, Like the comedy stations. Pick one artist and it will replay the whole order over. It's too many songs to keep replaying the same ones over. Right!?!?
3580,Jack Butler,"December 23, 2019",3," Most artists or songs you can think of you can find, unfortunately not all of them are obtainable. Recently for some reason, a lot of the songs and albums I have saved are being removed. I find this extremely annoying."

3583,Earl Kniffle,"January 5, 2020",5," I love the fact that after I play a few artists I like, they build some really good stations for me and I listen to all styles of music. I'm hearing things I would never have found on my own."
3584,Maaimachine DeFrance,"December 26, 2019",5," Love it. Easy to use, easy to set up and simple to work with on a daily basis. This app and a blue tooth headset were the best things to happen to my work day since they invented overtime."
3585,Unity Window & Door,"December 9, 2019",4," Enjoy live radio and many podcasts. Watch your cache and memory, could be easier to manage, my only criticism these days. Just look up how to get into settings to clear it"
3586,Daisy Montalvo,"January 23, 2020",3," Lately this app keeps messing up. I cant even hear one song because it cuts off and claims I have no internet connection, which I do. Please fix this problem!!!!"
3587,Ace Owens,"December 30, 2019",5, Best app to chill to and listen to all different types of music and just have a great time to. The only downside to it is that you can not look up specific songs. In the end it is the best music app you could possibly find.
3588,Ben Dover,"December 30, 2019",2," it's not a podcast player.
