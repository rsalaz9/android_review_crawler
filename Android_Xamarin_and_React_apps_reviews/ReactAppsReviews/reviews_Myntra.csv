I was 40 points away from being an Elite and after the update I was pushed back to 1034 points from being an Elite member in insider. Everyday I'm completing the daily tasks yet the 1034 mark is not increasing. The Myntra Insider grading has a major flaw. I e-mailed the issue thrice yet no response from them. Look into the matter, resolve it and I will get back to the 5 star rating."

15,Enuguri Umadevi,"April 20, 2020",1, It was a worst app among all apps first I thought it was a good app but it is very bad the products are not good and when we try to return the products the money isn't given directly and the money is transferred to the account and it is valid able only for 1 year

46,Akshay De,"March 18, 2020",4, Great app. Works well and is easy to navigate. Good collection of production. One star deducted for adding videos to the product while browsing. The autoplay of the video makes other music apps playing in the background to stop and redirect audio to myntra. It's super annoying but seems easy to fix.

It's a big turn off. I had ordered a product as a Valentine's gift for my girl friend and also requested a gift wrap. However, it wasn't a surprise anymore because you guys kept on sending her sms updates saying your bag of joy containing so and so is arriving at so and so time. I had shared her number so that the delivery can be easy not because you spoil the surprise."

You people have only 1 mode of contact available currently and that is E-Mail, that too you are not handling professionally. I have raised a query/concern few days back and am constantly getting the same drafted message again and again. This simply shows that you are not even reading my mail and just reverting with already drafted messages. The only difference in all mails I am getting is the agent name, rest everything is absolutely same. Totally Disgusting"
71,Bhakti Satre,"February 29, 2020",4, There should be an option to categorize wishlist items. All kind of items in single wishlist makes it tedious to find out wishlisted item. Already takes time to load all items in wishlist. At least it can be categorized to make finding easier.
72,Bala Shobika,"March 7, 2020",5," Very shopping friendly app. Their ""try and buy"" System is very helpful. One suggestion is, u can add question section for buyers.. So that buyers need not have any confusion about Whether the dress has sleeves or not ."

The only reason I use myntra is because the brands it covers, Otherwise the service is really terrible and almost every time dissatisfying. The delivery (at my pincode) is damn slow, while amazon provides faster service (at same pincode). Except that I really hated the slow return process. Another thing to add in the list is the surprising price hikes which bring difference of thousands in a night only. So tired of this that I'll be uninstalling it soon."

The delivery boy said that the card payment failed and i had to pay by Cash but later i got to know that the amount was debited from my account. I registered a compaint but myntra said that style delivery denied about my cash payment and said only card payment was done and they close my complaint.After this i felt that it's not safe to use debit card with myntra.

First they played the return pick game for almost 1 month & now they're playing the same game with refund process. Lost the trust & faith in Myntra support, escalation team & with case manager. This is really unprofessional and unacceptable behaviour. They're not taking this issue seriously. Now I'm afraid to do any shopping with Myntra."

They logged me out of the App after 3 years and then when trying to log in they flashed a wrong password and then locked my account. After a months follow up they are saying that they have suspended my account and can never be logged in again. Totally messed up team and horrible customer support. They have opened up such a good portal but because of poor back end support the complete shopping experience goes on toss. TOTALLY A DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE esp with the team.

The in house brand, Roadster is also not up to the mark as the biggest issue is with the colours. After every wash it gets faded and with in few months you have to discard it as it gets discolored. Roadster is also not having any feedback mechanism."

They show the stuff cheap by giving discounts but once you go to cart their shipping charges and taxes are so much that the total cost crosses the original mrp of that product!! And the customer care is a waste bcs you will just be talking to a macchine all time.

The filters very efficiently narrow down the choices and the 'search by image' feature is spot on too. The app is clutter-free and the colour scheme neat. Although I do have a complaint. In filters, earlier there was an option of selecting multiple choices in the same category, but now you can choose only one. For eg. if I want to choose fabric type as cotton, linen or silk, I can choose only any one of them, and not all."

There is a tax thing which you get to know when you check your cart. Prices are not inclusive of all the taxes. 2. The coupons doesn't apply to their full capacity.

Plus images should be adjustable according to devices. Especially detailed quality image should be uploaded. Options should be more as in choices and varieties. Lots of brand and good quality stuff in the market but very least possibilities here. Since it's India's leading fashion app online, it needs to set the standard itself. Plus it's a globalized economy so i bet your company mist be watching how global online markets be operating worldwide. Need to fix crashes where offers given but the page never shows up via some sorry clause. The offers should be regularly integrated for more marketing and indulgence of customers. Sizes and numbers of stock should be increased for maximum loved or purchased items. Varieties in bag section should be more. The fragrance section need more detailed description as customers cannot figure out via simple words of just items components of the products. Traditional dresses should make more sense. It just seems like the cultural heritage isn't sold as such if the products of Ethnic designs fo not reflect the milti ethnic culture of india. Allow famous styles of different culture to be a part of Ethnic section too. Promote Indian brands and Small scale factories via a section Of unseen products accumulated and distributed by you only. The regional products too have a huge demand if you tap into the correct desires of the customers. And lastly the fashion statements should be raised by allowing a free flow of World wide styles being at par launched or allowed to purchase via your imports from beyond a customers reach at a price affordable for the Indian market. This would change the customary approach of online shopping too. Love your app and happy Selling."

There is an option to include categories, by which the user will be excluding all other categories. The reverse, i.e. the option to exclude a few categories, while leaving all the others included, is unavailable. That will be very helpful when the user might be looking for items not belonging to a few categories. For ex, I'll never buy a pocket square, orna bow tie. So, I would like to exclude these while browsing. Just an example."
