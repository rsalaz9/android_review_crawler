It replaces that with ""you might like this, too"" suggestions... aka ""push ads."" Rendering it almost entirely useless, yet extremely annoying. This, slong with the mass removsl of checkout lines with ""self-check-out"" kiosks, has driven me to give up shopping here. Bye-bye Wally-world."

Walmart doesn't have as wide of a selection as, per say, Amazon or eBay, but the quality and overall performance triumphs that weakness. This app was made with quick-delivery and groceries in mind, so if you're looking to find something other than hobby and work supplies or home appliances and clothes, this wouldn't be the place to look."
2,Kristi Graham,"April 20, 2020",2, It was an awesome app until the latest update (which it forced me to do.) Now I can't sign in because it tells me I don't have an internet connection. Every. Time.

Every. Time. (I absolutely have an internet connection.) I've tried deleting and redownloading the app to no avail. It used to be useful and help me find items throughout the store and make lists. Lol oh well. I guess I'll go back to the demented scavenger hunt that is Walmart lol.

You finally fixed the cart issue, then one day you stopped accepting a card that I've used several times. Initially, therebwas a block that my bank removed and I've had no issues anywhere else. Around this time I was able to make a purchase of a smaller amount, then back to not able to purchase at all. There's no way for me to get help. No support. I guess I'll be ordering from Amazon."

I always get great deals on prices and get price matching at the actual store! You can order items and do free same day pick up which i love as well! Super convenient and easy especially if you have kids or during this pandemic they have made it super easy and convenient. I have used this app for a few years now and have been happy with everything i order."
5,Tim Matthews,"April 24, 2020",1," I consistently used the list feature which allowed me to add items to a shopping list and would tell me exactly where to find each item, sometimes useful for less commonly bought items. Now I have to wander the store aimlessly? Very safety conscious decision during a pandemic walmart!"

You have to type in a very specific search to find the item that you are looking for. It takes a lot of multiple searches and too much time to attempt to shop online to pick up at store. During the coronavirus this is essential especially shopping at a walmart location isn't as ""clean"" as walmart claims. Employees don't wear masks or gloves and have no respect for ""social distancing"" which is our number one defense against catching and spreading the infection. DON'T RISK IT!"
7,Jeremy Beattie,"April 18, 2020",1," Used to be a handy shopping app. Now when you open it you have to dismiss a screen asking if you want to do online shopping, then the main screen is 90% ads instead of features you want to use.

And the main ad rotates, which is way too distracting. Seems like all they care about is forcing ads down your throat instead of a good user experience."

Not only does it tell you what they have, but also if it is in store or online, how many they have, and where to find it, and let's you pay when you check out, and keeps you receipts if you need to return. Only downside is their inventory of fast moving items can't quite keep up, but that is understandable."

When checking out in the Grocery section of this App. Even more problematic: There is only a 1 hour time slot hold time- so "" later "" means never. Once someone has entered checkout and received that nebulous error message, their slot time should be locked-in until they can checkout. Walmart doesn't accept bug reports/feedback within the App. So customer service is non-existant. Old Grocery App fails also."
10,Linh Tran,"April 24, 2020",1," When you look up an item in ""your store"" it'll say available to pick up now but after you purchased it it'll tell you to pick up the next day, and certain item will say available at your store to purchase in store only but when you get to the store they say they never have this items in their store ...Full ReviewWhen you look up an item in ""your store"" it'll say available to pick up now but after you purchased it it'll tell you to pick up the next day, and certain item will say available at your store to purchase in store only but when you get to the store they say they never have this items in their store before.....

When I make changes to the entire order it says something along the lines of having issues and to try again later. When I click save to save a change, it says ""please wait a minute before trying to make changes,""... No clue what that means. I tried using the browser on my MacBook instead of the app and it was just as brutal. 👎👎👎👎👎"

I rescind all complaints over the years; NOT ONE ghoul/chinese firm selling hand sanitizer $13 for 4 TBS. Loyal & faithful to America First. I've become loyal & faithful myself. ;-)"

It helps me help customers find items in the store, and find out if an item they found online is something we carry in store. Also just great to have for ordering products for myself. The grocery app was a lifesaver when my baby was born. Just ordered what I needed and set it for pick up. No need to go inside with a newborn baby, shopping done."

Yes. I checked to make sure that the card number was correct. And I tried to put things in my cart it said weren't in the store, which I know because the store rarely has them anyway. So I was going to order it and pay shipping. But it wasn't available for shipping either. So why even have it on your site? It wasn't available to pick up at any other store either. A"

And the integration with their brick and mortar stores has made the shopping process easier and more cost effective for the customer. I shop Amazon, Cosco, Target, every business. But Walmart is number one overall on price, product availability, and customer satisfaction. I have been impressed by Walmart employees during the covid-19 stressful times. Great job!"
21,Jason Lopez,"April 24, 2020",1," App is so slow it seems unresponsive. The app workedfairly slow before on a premium phone. Now that grocery app is incorporated into this Walmart app, this app seems to hang randomly, just as the stand-alone grocery app did. This is a beta app, at best. It really should be alpha and unreleased."

Doesn't use the store nearest me, despite having manually set that store. If the menu has a set up for ordering specifically for pickup later that day...I couldn't find it. Every time I tried ordering items, anything in my cart was automatically assigned to Delivery, and upcharged accordingly. I'm not interested in learning how to maneuver through an app that at best lets me collect my purchase quicker than my going to get it off the shelves myself."

35,Martin Needom,"April 11, 2020",1, Poorly structured navigation with no ability to filter items for selected store. Default store was in California with no immediate way to know that. Items listed are not what is available in the local store. I found this app to be frustrating and ultimately a waste of time.

38,Christopher A Kelsey,"April 10, 2020",1, Separate it. The new app is junk. Search/filter/etc is all a mess. Not the time to implement new crud with this health crisis going on. Whatever moron decided it was time to release this in the midst of the chaos needs fired. Along with the programmers.

42,Paul Autry,"April 19, 2020",1, Ever since this last update. The app keeps crashing. I have to open it several times before it'll let me use it. I've cleared the cache and have done a hard restart to no avail.
43,Ruth Gilchrist,"April 17, 2020",5," I like the idea of finding what I want, item by item and saving them on a list. When I get ready to buy I transfer them to cart. Easy to do. One problem...no shortcut is put on your screen."
44,Lacey Dixon,"April 19, 2020",3, I do enjoy this app but it is very tricky and you have to really pay attention to what you're buying I've got numerous things I had to return also on the grocery app it was almost impossible to find great value lunch meat for example
45,ALICIA MARIE,"April 23, 2020",1, This was a great app at one point. Now every time I try to check in when picking up my groceries all I get is booted off the app and a message that the app has stopped working. Come on! Y'all gotta do better than this.
46,Rebecca Temple,"April 8, 2020",5," The app is great, I like it. One problem. When the update took place it did not give an icon for the new app and the old icon no longer works. I have to go to the Google play store to open this app."
47,Chris,"April 8, 2020",1," Global Pandemic, unable to checkout because of poor design? Once I FINALLY was able to reserve a pickup time, I was UNABLE to pay for things. Check out, choose payment, prepare order, choose payment and REPEAT! I guess it's off to practice my social distancing in person. This sucks!!"
48,Shannon Young,"April 17, 2020",1," Why did you change the app? The new app is NOT user friendly. Wirh the old app, you could look up stock in your store and it would tell you what isle it's on. During this pandemic, when you want to get in and get out, knowing where to find something is very helpful."

I went to my local Walmart to buy it. The laptop was displayed in the Electronics sector, but was not in stock according to the staff. The app showed the same item in stock at a nearby store, so I bought it via the app. I got the email detailing that they would notify me the pick up time. One hour later, the app tells me that the order was canceled, and if I wanted the laptop I had to pay full price ($100 more). Not satisfied."
50,M. Flint,"April 24, 2020",3," The window is too narrow to read full description of merchandise. Also, there are many items that have been miscategoried so searches bring up truly odd choices at time--GIGO"
51,Dallas Bowman,"April 13, 2020",5, App works great and it makes my shopping experience better regardless if I'm shopping in the stores or purchasing online for pick up in the stores. Offers a lot of valuable resources and options for me.

Numerous returns on products.

What sucks is that various items are mostly in store purchase only so they are really not reducing the amount of people that go into store. I don't care that the other local grocery store takes a week to get my items I will not risk myself going in the store. I will say for electronics I appreciate being able to have my warranty on the app. Also having the pharmacy in the same app is convenient along with having my credit card acct.

257,Jessica Cogswell,"February 6, 2020",3, Update: They have added the save to SD feature again.

The app is much too large to not have that feature.
258,Marcie Allie,"February 16, 2020",4," The only reason i didn't give the app five stars is that I'd like to see them add a cart calculator option like other stores have. It would be SO handy to tally the cart as I go without having to open a separate, independently produced app."
259,Nelly,"February 29, 2020",1, This app was great to use before it updated. Every time I try to use it to scan certain products in store it says either the item is out of stock or error use. Also the fact that they removed what isle the product is in and now it's hard to look for.

348,Sarah Mitchell,"February 13, 2020",1, Trying to get photos printed the app takes 30 min or mite to load them for printing then says checkout error has occured. Super frustrating and tone consuming. The app has been updated not sure why it keeps happening.
349,Allysen,"March 11, 2020",3, Could be better. Everytime I remove something from my saved items or add it to my cart it resets the screen and then I have to go back to saved items and find the next thing. #ANNOYING
350,linda gels,"March 20, 2020",1, App. Worked fine until this year now I continualy get a message that it has stopped. I used to purchase a lot from this app and would like to buy more.
351,Donald Dodson,"April 2, 2020",5, This app makes finding what I need extremely easy. Also helps do everything in store and guides you to the exact aisle.
352,Harold Childers,"April 10, 2020",1, It will not work on my tablet and have an onn with it preinstaled can't use it because it keeps wanting to update but it won't

354,Kiana Williams,"February 9, 2020",2," Some features seem selective. If you want to leave feedback something interrupts the app. If you want to do payment plans on items that accept affirm, it's only certain colors."
355,Alton Hemmings,"February 11, 2020",3, The combination of the store/website and grocery apps have slowed down the features. Takes too long to load either one. Too many steps to navigate through. Walmat Pay feature buried under services.

358,Vicente Agama,"April 4, 2020",5, I can check my receipts and use it for Walmart pay. Helps with finding things in store. Easy to use and saves time.
359,Tristan Haines,"April 9, 2020",5," it makes finding items in the store super easy, never need to find someone to help find something if you have the app."
360,Mary Jack,"April 10, 2020",2, Cant check in. Just takes me to the app which says installed. Frustrating.

363,Dennis Meade,"February 21, 2020",1," The idiots at WM keep adding stupid things like a selection on ""Where would you like to shop - Walmart grocery or Walmart"". Seriously. And the asinine popup when you are in the store welcoming you to the store needs to go. All these things slow down the app, making it useless."

366,Kayla D,"February 17, 2020",1, Reviews are accurate. It doesn't work right. I have an account with walmart it doesn't allow me to sign in and even if I try to make a new one it doesn't let me. My main account I use works from web browser. Sad the app doesnt work

377,Keith Massey,"February 19, 2020",5, Great to use in store and away from store. Price check scanner is very good.... Note . Use it on clearance items and often as not you'll find lower prices than stated.
378,J. Gray,"March 7, 2020",1," App info is not up to date.... In store as I type & info on app vs store is incorrect. App states 6 items are in stock and stock does not have item nor display.

379,MsLow W,"March 26, 2020",4," The app is customer friendly. It's easy to navigate and find what you need. Most items can be picked up or mailed. Also, some items aren't being sent from Walmart which it let's you know."

385,Amy Beatty,"February 6, 2020",5, I love to use it when I'm in the store and find an item I'm curious about. I'll use the bar code scanner to pull it up and read reviews. It will also tell you what aisle an item is in at your store which is very helpful

389,Dave Robinson,"March 4, 2020",2," For a company already so huge that consumer mistrust is justified, it should be extra easy to disable notifications. Nope. And where's the search button for every page? I don't think Walmart is testing these apps very well. I'll just use the browser instead. Uninstalled."

407,Dustin Brooks,"March 7, 2020",1, Hate the new update. Pharmacy and prescription refills are no longer available. App is less functional. The developers (or whoever made the divcisions) should be let go for these useless and regressive application edits.

413,Jerry Preiss,"February 12, 2020",1, Refund/Return interface is a mess. Forget success online. Most of the local store associates were unfamiliar with dealing with on line purchases and just added to the data entry interface mess. I spit on this app.

1208,Mike May,"December 14, 2019",1," Thanks for the vibrating deal notifications at 7am on a Saturday. I would have hated to get to sleep in for once. Also found it impossible to check out with in store pick up. No matter what I do, still tries to ship with a delivery fee. Uninstalling app now."
1209,Michael Morris,"January 12, 2020",5," Won't let me log in. Getting a frustrating loop where I provide my credentials, then I have to prove I'm not a robot. I'm pretty sure I know what a fire hydrant looks like. I even had my dog verify. Edit-- The app is letting me log in now."

1214,Joshua Cook,"January 3, 2020",1," Order was not ready within 8 hours of setting it. Ended up buying the item twice. Just buy your things in the store, this doesn't save time and can cost you.

1215,Rat Packer,"January 14, 2020",5," It says updated Jan 9, 2020. Well now the original icon on screen doesn't work to open the app. Not just mine but my husbands and a friends icon neither. They should correct or post this. Still 5 star shopping though."
1216,Robin Sequira,"January 20, 2020",2," Walmart Pay is too slow. Use an always ready bar code like Target does. The UI is bloated, there's way too many menu items that people rarely use. Baby and wedding registries, for example, are not items accessed daily/weekly."
1217,Lavender,"January 22, 2020",2," The pharmacy app portion is not sending refills I need. About Every other med it's not letting me know they are ready.

1236,DennysAt4am,"November 18, 2019",1," I don't know what you did, but as of right now the app won't even open on 2 different phones by 2 different manufacturers. It's been uninstalled/reinstalled & reboot on both phones."
1237,Steve Kimball,"November 22, 2019",1, I do not like the card as it looks too much like regular capital one card which it makes it confusing to find the right capital one at check out fast. At least you could have givin us a choice of the color or the design of the Walmart card
1238,Vicki Atwell,"December 6, 2019",5, I love the feature where I can scan barcodes on products to check the price when there's no price on the Shelf only thing I wish it had on that end is if it would have a list of what you had recently scanned so you can find it quickly again
1239,Michelle Broeker,"December 11, 2019",3," Love the app. Can keep track of receipt, check prices, and find stuff in the store. The pharmacy part of the app does not seem to be working properly though."

I like being able to scan my receipts in because if I don't have a paper receipt I won't remember to log the purchase into my check book (we all know what that can lead to). And I have my walmart account setup to my spam/ trash email that check a couple times a month. It takes more time for me to pull this app up and load the Walmart Pay than it does to just use my debit card, doesn't save time on my end (I only point this out because that's why they changed it). I will be deleting this app since it will no longer be of use to me."

I turned them off in the app but didn't realize until after my purchase and I had left the store that the app automatically switched a gift card back on as the default payment method.

The only way I found to resolve the issue is to completely remove the gift cards from my account - not an ideal solution."

For example, I went to Walmart last night, spent over $100 but couldn't scan through Walmart pay because you guys were having a temporary error.... I probably could've gotten a few dollars back on my savings catcher but nooooo, because of a technology glitch and the fact that I can't scan my paper receipts any longer there goes that savings... I think we the consumer should have the option to decide, you should make it to where you are allowed to scan paper receipts or do it the way it is now. You have to keep the older generation in mind, for example my mom loved scanning her paper receipts but now she won't even shop at Walmart anymore because the app is too complicated for her to understand.. Make some changes to keep the consumers happy or I will be another that's forced to stop shopping Walmart.."

Many times it can't find a server. 3 times it has force logged me out due to some update, and wants me to go through an 87 step verification of picking stoplights to prove its me, despite having correct password and fingerprint proof. So, instead if holding up the line for 3 hours you have to use another payment method, which now thanks to greed apparently doesn't allow receipts to be submitted to Savings Catcher...

I was told by a Walmart associate to skip the actual website and just use the app instead. I downloaded the app to determine whether the store near my house had something I wanted in stock. It says it did, but the associate looked everywhere and couldn't find the item. I used the app again to locate the same item at a different location, which the app indicated was in stock. In an effort to save myself the hour round-trip across town, I called ahead. After spending nearly 20 minutes on the phone being transferred and put on hold, the associate confirmed that the system said there were 16 in stock. I explained my situation and asked if someone could verify the item was really on the shelf. After a few more minutes on hold, the associate informed me that they didn't actually have any...not on the shelf, nor in the back. On the upside, I saved myself 30+ minutes. On the downside, it seems that the app and system just aren't accurate. Not entirely sure why that's the case, but the lack of accuracy drastically undermines the usefulness of the app, as I can't be assured that what I see is actually what I'd get."

My personal favorite is Walmart Pay, I prefer the self checkouts, so I open the app sign-in in Walmart Pay & using the camera on my phone scan the code on the self checkout screen. It automatically logs in, you can start scanning & bagging your items, once done, it uses your stored encrypted payment info & pays, saves the receipt on your phone in the Walmart app & you leave. You then just hit submit & the receipt it sent to the automated price checker which compares prices of what you bought with local stores for 7 days, if there's a cheaper price it automatically notifies you & adds the difference to a virtual gift card in Walmart Pay. Great, easy, convenient, time saving app! Make life even easier & check out Walmart Grocery app!!!"

But I just got an email saying they are changing the savings catcher so you can't submit paper receipts anymore-it will only work with Walmart pay. WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA?!

I'm not going to give my phone to them-especially to my 16 year old son who will go shopping after school sometimes. What started off as a great idea with great savings always screws the consumer in the end somehow! Hopefully they will be bombarded with complaints and go back to being able to scan the paper receipts

When selecting the original transaction under Purchase History, that transaction's Purchase Details are indeed the details that show.  However, when you then select the option to show or share the receipt facsimile, it shows or shares the return / exchange transaction's receipt facsimile,  rather than the original purchase that you are viewing.  The return / exchange transaction's receipt facsimile is shown or shared, whether you have selected the original purchase or the return / exchange purchase.

Unfortunately, Walmart has decided that the customer must use Walmart Pay and no other alternative to use the Savings Catcher feature. What a mistake!

Secondly when my mom does her shopping she's never going to use Walmart Pay and I'm never going to be able to convince her to. So now my family is missing out on hundreds of savings. This is a great app, but I only used it and shopped at Walmart altogether because of the app's Savings Catcher feature. I no longer have any use for the app and I'm sad to see it go down this way.

It's one thing to push a product or service like paying on your app, but this was stupid and just seems like more of a way to reduce the amount of people using saving catcher. I'll be using my balance and uninstalling. P.S. Why do your hand baskets disappear for months at a time? Are you guys eating them? It wont make me use a basket and spend more. I'll just buy what I can hold or go to Target across the street."

For a shopping app, it is a bit on the confusing side to use, and seems to be trying to cram way too many features into one program. Also, I swear at one time it could show you in/out of stock notices of products at a local store but the last few times I've checked, that information is missing. Maybe I'm just crazy? Also, the Walmart Pay feature that uses the QR code for paying doesn't seem to work on some devices. With the exception of the Pay feature, I don't think this does much of anything that you can't just do on their website, which works good on mobile browsers."

It still accepts receipts the old way but it doesn't show up as submitted receipts. I've lost over a month of potential savings on the updated app. 😡 I'll just shop for the stuff that cost more at Walmart elsewhere since Walmart is no longer paying me back the price difference if I had purchased those items in their store.

This is just ridiculous. I shouldn't have to sit here and jump through hoops to try to get the better deal if they want me to shop at their store.

There is NO need to link your debit/credit card for purchases. The app then prompts me to survey my visit (for a chance at a giftcard) and to submit to Savings Catcher. However, it would be nice if there was a setting for automatic submission everytime without the prompt. The only downside is HAVING to use the Savings Catcher funds with every purchase; I liked building a balance. I can see how having to scan at checkout would be frustrating if someone else does your shopping. The in-store price checker is awesome, I can never find those in Wal-mart. And I recently used the search function to locate the gift tape and batteries at a different store than I normally use. Quick and easy!"

You don't even have to pay using the Walmart Pay, just go to your settings, turn the cards off, scan the QR code at the debit reader, and tell the cashier you want to pay by physical debit/credit/gift card, cash, or check, get your receipt automatically on your phone, send it to Savings Catcher, and your on your way! If you need to make a return, head to the Express Return lane in customer service, go to your purchase history in the app and touch the search bar to scan your item. This will pull up the receipt the item is on. Find and touch Start Return, follow the prompts, scan the QR Code, and the register and service desk associate will do the rest."

I won't be able to use the Walmart Pay until October 29th, I'm really looking forward to that. I'm not a fan of WM online shopping as I like to go in the store, look, feel, smell. examine the items I'm interested in.  Grocery shopping the same, I'm real picky on my fresh veggies and meats so those things I wouldn't be purchasing online anyway. So many have left unfavorable reviews.  I'm hopeful that all those bugs have been worked out by the time it goes live in my area.  Once it does I will up date my review comments and rating.  Fingers crossed I have no issues."

It has been a wonderful app. Since the change to have to use Walmart pay it won't take any of my receipts no one seems to know how to use it I've asked over 5 employees I get a different answer from everyone because nobody understands how to use it. We even tried to use it at the pharmacy counter and they couldn't figure it out either. Very disappointed with this app it tells you what to do it but it won't do it. Also, somebody said that I have to put my charge card on my Walmart pay. I have that on my phone but I am not putting my charge card on my unsecured phone. Us customers who don't want to put our charge cards on a telephone should not be punished for that. I have been a good customer with Walmart for many years and I have used this app and done very well with it. They took something that was easy to use and very rewarding and made it complicated and a nightmare for everyone involved."

Pretty much the only thing it's good to have for is if you want to order something online through walmart & you can track it. ALTHOUGH BEWARE when buying something online through walmart because some of the companys that they allow to sell on their website are not legit. I order a clothing item from a company & when I got it it was no where near my size...in fact the only person it would have fit would be a toddler. I tried to contact the company because on walmarts site the company said that if you have any issues or need to make a return to ""click here"" & they would get you started on the process. That ""click here"" button did nothing. I tried to email them...no email address. So I was out $20. Update: Now they won't even let you scan your paper receipts anymore. They are taking away convenience by taking away options. This app just sucks altogether now. I used to be against buying from Amazon but Walmart is making their competitors look better."

After Installing the app, a notice pops up. Price check scanning app program will no longer work, starting 10-29-18. That's tomorrow! I have shopped a lot at Walmart. I place this review as my commitment to not shop at Walmart again! They have 20+ human checkout lanes, but only two open at any given time. I'll bet they cut a deal with the city saying they will hire X# of cashiers for all the human lanes. Then as soon as the store opens...no cashiers. But There are plenty of managers walking around and 4-5 other workers. They all look at us staying in the line 10 deep and look away like everything is normal. Even at busy times on Weekends. My ice cream and frozen goods are always thawed by the time I get home. I am sure my milk, steaks, and other items spoil faster, because they warm up during the long checkout times. Don't even get me started on the automated checkout lanes. They suck, because the automated robot lady always tells me to place item in bag, even after I do so. The only way to get her to shut up and let me continue, is to pull the bag and place it on the floor. Self checkout takes sssssooooo long, my groceries ruin/melt there too. So, the choice is obvious. No more Wal-mart, as the one I have gone to is mis-managed for customer ease and managed for corporate costs only. Good bye! Over and out Walmart!"

First I am going to delete this app. Then I am going to stop grocery shopping at Walmart. Since I've had this savings catcher account in 2014 my account has been hacked 3 times and the gift card has somehow become unlinked to my account meaning I can submit receipts but till their tier 2 support fixes it I can't access my ""savings"". Savings are really just price matches, which are simply incentives to shop at Walmart instead of shopping around with weekly grocery sale fliers. I have ""saved"" around $570.00 since I started using the app in fall 2014. But, since my savings catcher gift card has been screwed up again since August 1, 2018 and I'm now on the 2nd escalation without it being fixed i absolutely have no trust in Walmarts ability to store any of my payment information electronically. They can't even handle their own gift card! Other functions of the app. I really wish there was a default setting when searching merchandise to limit results to Walmart only. I understand & appreciate they are trying to compete with Amazon. And I do shop Walmarts 3rd parties when looking for some items. But 99.9% of my searches on the Walmart app are for things I want to see if they carry it in store & the price. Finally, it's nice that the app detects which Walmart you are shopping in, but some stores don't have cellular signals inside the store making the feature worthless."

3284,Melissa Taylor,"October 3, 2018",5, I love the find item in store feature. It tells you the isle number where the item is located and if it is in stock. Walmart pay makes checkout a breeze.

I usually pay with cash, but scan the QR code at the register before I begin checkout so that my receipts are stored in the app to make returns easier since there is no longer a way to upload receipts into the app since the Savings Catcher feature was taken away from us. (I've switched to another app for savings/coupons.) I had Walmart Pay configured to pay by gift card only. My gift card balance happened to be zero. In the past, the register display would say that my gift card balance was zero and to pay by alternate means and then I paid with cash. This time, it chose one of the credit cards in my online Walmart account (seems to choose by alphabetical order) and charged my purchase to the credit card WITHOUT my permission. (Like I said, I always have my Walmart Pay set to ""gift cards only."") This needs to be fixed asap or I will not longer use Walmart Pay.

3479,Sandy Atchison,"December 2, 2018",1, This app has been the worst convoluted app ever. I guess Walmart wants to eliminate savings catcher.

I don't like the new change at all, plus my parents don't even have a phone that will work with this new change. Just keep it simple Wal-Mart. If you are going to change it, keep it simple so everyone can use savings catcher.  Such as, why not use a rewards card like other retail/ grocery stores use. A customer could scan their card at the register, lower prices will be automatically found and you can have the option to say yes or no if you want to use your savings or save them for a later time. Plus you could still use them online if you wish.  If people want to still use WalMart pay , fine but give other people something alittle more easy for them to use."

3519,Abi Dannenhoffer,"November 28, 2018",2, It was great until they took away receipt scanning. Now you have to scan at the register. I don't always have my phone on me or out when I'm shopping or checking out. So unfortunate that they changed it; losing money.

3581,Master Yubyub,"September 21, 2018",1," I downloaded the app to use the savings catcher. But, the way they will be changing it sucks. Therefore, I will be removing the app as soon as I spend my saved money. Should have left the scanning feature alone how it is."
3582,andria limburg,"May 12, 2019",2," I've loved it-very helpful, especially when in store. Lately however it won't sort things by aisle location (or even give the aisle), won't check things off, says everything is out of stock, and doesn't acknowledge when you're in store. Almost useless."

Wal-Mart didn't get rid of it they just fixed it so you don't have to carry all those paper receipts or forget to scan them like I did most times. Yayyyy Wal-Mart!! If someone is shopping for you just have that person download the app and give them your log in (if you trust them) so they can scan the QR code at the register to save your receipt and get the savings with the Savings catcher

I send my kids, husband, and other family members to do my shopping at Walmart at times and the app is on my phone not theirs. So sending them is useless now. I can't receive any of my savings now. Totally stupid now. Not only that but now since I have to add their receipts manually now, my purchase history is not even on my account. I believe Walmart has lost a lot of business with their new way. Lot's of thumbs down."

3654,"Guy Zandler BSN, RN","January 19, 2019",5, I'm loving this app. With regards to shopping it makes it as easy to shop through this app as it is with Amazon except it will tell you if the store has the item.

Secondly, because they no longer price match, I'm located in a very rural area, and one of the only stores Savings Catcher tracks is with Dollar General, and most of the time, Dollar General carries smaller versions of everything Walmart has, so it's rarely ever the same UPC.

3805,Mary Blacketer,"December 12, 2018",1, I loved this app before the update. It's so inconvenient to have to use Walmart pay so I can get my money back on savings catcher. Just a cheap way to not lose any money and rip of their customers.

3808,Kimberly Vance,"October 2, 2018",1, Would have gave this app 5 stars but I think its ridiculous that after 10/29/18 you can no longer scan your receipt for Savings Catcher. Will delete the app after that happens. Not everyone wants to use Walmart pay to still be able to benefit from the Savings Catcher 👎
3809,Mariah R,"August 31, 2019",1, The main point of this app is savings catcher. But they broke savings catcher by not letting you scan receipts anymore. It now forces you to use walmart pay which doesn't work if you don't have a gift card or your debit or credit card saved. Edit: and now they broke the dance for later list.

3959,David Walker,"June 3, 2019",2, I downloaded this app mainly so I could send money to family. It's very convenient when there are long lines. The problem is there always seems to be some sort of unexplainable error so the app only works about 10% of the time...

So Walmart stopped price matching now reading other reviews I see savings catcher is gone too. So now what's the use of the App? Walmart just one more company that values the dollar over customers. I guess the Trump tax cuts weren't enough for Walmart to keep the savings catcher. Walmart is really going to put the screws to it's customers when the other Trump tariff's kick in. No one is a valued customer to Walmart anymore. Just money that's all.
3961,Enchil Snoogens,"June 7, 2019",1," discontinued the savings catcher in may 2019 but the damn thing hasn't worked since sept 2018. This app lags, freezes, and is usually over priced on products. I am uninstalling this app. And trying my best to shop everywhere else that's not walmart."
3962,Brittany Ross,"July 17, 2019",3, I hate that when I click on an item to look at reviews and such there is no back button to get back to the whole list of items. Maybe I'm just missing it and you could make it bigger but having to start at the beginning of the list again makes me not want to look anymore.
3963,Brenda Bradford,"July 30, 2019",5," I love it, it makes it easier to get what you want ...and online has more options for what you're looking for vs.in store. The best thing about in store with this app it tells you what aisle your products are on so no running in circles searching!!!!"

3967,Lawrence Merchant,"August 26, 2019",1, There seems to be no search engine. The experience was poor. Too much time to locate the product I wanted. There are product categories. My experience was like wandering around a store when you know what you want but can't find the right shelf.
3968,Michael Billups,"August 29, 2019",3," The amount of time it takes to open, access, and unlock anything in this app is ridiculous.

3986,Cathy Frantz,"November 5, 2018",5, Update. You do not have to link a card to your app. It will ask you to insert card or cash if no card linked. Will not use you balance accrued until you tell the app to. Back to liking this app.
3987,Alma Lesperance,"November 24, 2018",2, I liked the app until i couldn't scan the receipts for the savings catcher. I realize i can do Walmart pay and be able to submit the e receipts to savings catcher but i always pay cash and it make its to complicated to do it through the app.
3988,Bethany Stercho,"November 6, 2018",2, They changed the savings catcher and i am extremely disappointed. I do not like the idea of having it connected to my credit card online. Please just leave it seperate and let me just scan my reciept!

4045,A Google user,"December 9, 2018",1, I'm not happy with this app either.  Can't  enter receipts especially when paid with  cash.  Haven't found an employee  who knows how to redeem my savings especially when I use the scan and go.  Please  change it back.

4049,Heather Marcus,"November 20, 2018",5," I'm really impressed with Walmart's app. My favorite feature is the store map. If I don't know where something is, I appreciate that it has an aisle # and shows me a map of where the item is. Walmart pay is easy to use. Keep it up, Walmart!"
4050,Laura Davis,"April 1, 2019",5, love the ease of going on the app and browsing hundreds of items seeing something i like and then checking out with walmart pay.... or having walmart shop the items and have it all ready for me love love love the ease of navigation also. great app

RIP walmart app"
4055,Jim L.,"May 8, 2019",1," Leave it to Walmart to screw up a good thing. I updated the app about 3 weeks ago and suddenly it started freezing up after a few minutes of use, so I updated it again couple of hours ago. Now I can't even open the darn thing without it freezing up!"

4061,A Google user,"September 19, 2018",1, The lastest update has messed the whole thing up. The pharmacy part of the app doesn't work at all. It keeps giving an error message saying they can't open pharmacy right now. It's only good for checking prices in store.
4062,Phyllis Schultz,"January 13, 2019",1, Savings catcher used to be so easy to use - now I have money on savings catcher and can't figure out how to use it.  Also have no idea how to add additional receipts.  No longer a good thing so now I shop around prices before buying all at Walmart.
4063,Jon Runnels,"December 17, 2018",1, The only reason for the change to the app was to make it impossible to get money back. Nobody is going to remember to scan receipts at the register. And if you forget then you can't scan them off of the paper copy. Uninstalled.
4064,anne slusher,"December 2, 2018",1, i used to love this app especially for the Walmart savers program. But now it will only compare the receipt for price comparison if you use a debit or credit card. It won't even save the receipt. Not worth my time.

4068,Jon Noles,"June 2, 2019",1," The only reason I installed this app was to use savings catcher. Discontinuing that program has freed me from Walmart and now I'm more likely to shop at other grocery stores, so in a way, this app has been a good thing I guess."

4075,Marcus Dugan,"September 24, 2019",5," I mainly use this app to find things that Walmart has in stock.

4131,Phillip Tripp,"January 20, 2019",3," I use it at the store to find something or check prices, but the savings catcher is worthless to me since i usually always get cash back and you cant do that if you use Walmart Pay. I would rather scan my receipts."
4132,Lorrie,"May 16, 2019",4, my mistake on the last post. I accidentally checked the fingerprint option. the app is good when you're in the store and want to price check or locate an item. on line prices are great and pick up in store is convenient.
4133,Hot Mike,"March 3, 2019",5," No issues using this app for paying. One of the best I've used. Receipts are simple to recover and you'll have a complete list of your purchases for tracking buying habits. Kudos, Walmart! 👍🏽"
4134,Rebbecca Fehr,"November 8, 2018",2, I used to love the app and told everyone about it. However now you can't scan your receipt unless you pay with a card using there app. So if your using cash your out of luck to save money.
4135,carmen c,"November 13, 2018",1," Ughhh i used to love savings catcher, but now you apparently have to scan a code in store. Thats the only purpose i had this app honestly. Bring back savings catcher to the app, ain't nobody have time to scan a qr code at check-out.🙄"
4136,R Hudy,"September 23, 2018",1," App was fine when I first installed, but now too many ads, and I will NOT use Walmart Pay to access Savings Catcher. Already started shopping at Sprouts which has better meat and produce. Looks like I'll be shopping elsewhere for other items now as well."
4137,Pamela Hornick,"November 17, 2018",1, Used to like this app until they updated and forced you to use Wal-Mart Pay if you want to use Savings Catcher. I will not attach my debit card to this app. Uninstalled because it takes up too much space on my phone since I used it mainly for Savings Catcher.
4138,Lisa Terrell-Galdamez,"January 12, 2019",3," for the most part it's ok. but savings catcher now can only be used if I use Walmart pay. I can't get cash back using Walmart pay so it's pretty frustrating. also when I know prices down the road are cheaper, savings catcher still doesn't catch it"
4139,Jon Davis Jr,"December 7, 2018",1, App failed to offer receipts for purchases. This is not okay. App is broken. Does not work. No Savings Catcher credit given. No way to verify accuracy of charges.

4141,Mike M,"April 20, 2019",2," Works great. But, runs in the background and kills my battery dead in like 3 hours. No matter how many times I close the app. Will not use because of this. Uninstalling."
4142,Devon Kroener,"January 19, 2019",1," garbage now. Sadly they took away your ability to scan paper reciepts. Now you must ""connect"" at the register with the app, even tho after it says connected still does not submit your reciept to savings catcher. Terrible bean counter decision."
4143,Sam Welch,"November 16, 2018",5," Amazing app. I placed online orders without problems but I mainly use it for the pharmacy. Reliable, fast, private and accurate. Highly recommend. Lots of options."
4144,Mary McNally,"April 4, 2019",5, Fantastic app. I love the price check feature. The only drawback is it keeps changing stores on me. But that's a small price to pay for knowing if something is in stock before I leave the house! Keep up the good work Walmart.
4145,Mary Isborn,"October 18, 2018",3, I used to love this app but all of a sudden I wasn't getting credit for items that were found lower elsewhere. It showed when I looked at the scanned receipts but I didn't get the credit
4146,Courtney Thigpen,"December 2, 2018",1, Used to be an awesome app till they discontinued the receipt scan. You now have to pay at the register using Walmart pay in order to use savings catcher. Walmart doesn't have good service so using Walmart pay is impossible.
4147,A Google user,"November 16, 2018",3, It was perfect before the update. Now you cant manually add the information from the reciept so if the QR reader doesnt work then you cant enter the reciept! Please fix this! The app was so much better before!

4156,Rachel,"November 1, 2018",2, It's WAS a great app. Until they got rid of saving catcher. Walmart pay wouldn't even work after they changed it. No point in using it now....give us the ability to scan our receipts again and I'll redownload it.
4157,Earth Mother!,"June 3, 2019",4," I like this app. Being disabled, this makes it easier for me too shop and than have it delivered to my house. I don't have to work my way thru the crowds or stand in long lines, waiting to check out. This is very convenient for me."

Still won't scan some receipts and still unable to add manually with TC # and date because date format is not working. i have receipts i can't put in because of this. Please fix this asap.
4162,Kristine Hayward,"August 14, 2019",2, Im disappointed as now I cant scan in my reciepts. It does not allow for my full keyboard either so I can add manually.

4164,Wanda Ford,"August 17, 2019",5, I use this app while I'm shopping. It gives me the location of the item. I can also scan the item if I'm unsure of the price. Clearance items are sometimes mispriced. If you scan a $7 item it might scan as $5 or $3.
4165,Alyce Anarchy99,"August 30, 2019",4," Pretty good app. Wish it had the ability to move saved for later or in cart items to a list, and itd be great if you could have the ability to just ""heart"" items to an automatic favorites list. But overall much better than most playstore shopping apps."

4225,Houda D. Pruitt,"August 25, 2019",1," This app is bad, and you should feel bad. None of the advertised functions actually work. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, as this is just reflective of the quality of the in-store experience (which I was hoping to avoid through said app, but to no avail). Thanks for nothing!"
4226,Michelle Andrews,"September 1, 2019",1, New website jumps around too much. Seems to try to assume what I want next. Does not leave me a chance to look at the page that is on the screen. Navigation does not work at the stores near me. (There are 6.) The internet is REALLY BAD inside the stores.
4227,Lori Landry,"September 3, 2019",2," It is nearly impossible to search the site and find what you want. I've searched ""womens shorts"" and ended up with a page full of food, sheets or boys clothes! Seriously. Very very poor search function."
4228,Donna Layton,"September 15, 2019",1," My new tablet from WalMart came with preloaded software. However, when prompted to update the app, it justs goes into a vicious cycle...telling me my device is not compatible with the update. In turn, leaving me unable to use the WalMart app. I have done every suggested option, but to no avail."
4229,Abrie Lee,"September 14, 2019",4," AWESOME, but I don't like that I had to update it, because it took soooooo long, it kept saying that it was 100% loaded, but then it would restart and go back to 0%"
4230,Mark Allen,"September 29, 2019",3, Hi I really like your app but when I was trying to get a $10 gift card for PS4 it said I couldn't get it sent to my email it could only be delivered but all the other PlayStation 4 cards can be sent to your email why can't the $10 one be that's the only problem I have with it
4231,Jet Maki,"October 3, 2019",3," Missing items...anoyed!!! had used them before for a year never a mistake! What changed? Hopefully when I try this again, if order is incorrect this time. No more walmart...online or stores. Really been failing at stores also, all of them"

4242,A Google user,"November 18, 2018",1, Nov 2018- Use to love this app. But with the recent changes to Saving Catcher not allowing me to upload my receipts at home when I have time it's no longer useful. Like many others stated very disappointed please bring back the old versin.
4243,Jolene Delregno,"November 4, 2018",1, I tried using the app today and found out you can't scan the upc you have to type it in now. Why is that and i don't like it. I hope they fix it back to the other way. Then ill give it 5 stars
4244,Robyn Romero,"May 3, 2019",2, Finally figured out it was draining my battery even though it was set to sleep when not being used. This has been happening recently so it must be the last update. Have to delete.
4245,Janice Harper,"November 2, 2018",1, Tried numerous times to add. Slow loading and no it is not my phone. Different to open. Uninstalled and reinstalled several times same problem. Old app had no problems.
4246,Roberto Alvarado,"May 11, 2019",5," new articles should be shown first instead of refurbished stuff. the filter does not do much. everything sold at walmart should appear first and not the other retailers. The ""at your store"" option goes random after touching the store map option"
4247,A Google user,"December 1, 2018",1," Can't submit my receipts to savings catcher anymore, even though I made the switch to Walmart pay.. Can't even use savings catcher anymore.. Might as well just get rid of it all together if people can't use it! Very unhappy and was a loyal Walmart customer..hope it changes back very soon"
4248,Stephanie Jones,"November 4, 2018",2, I don't like that I can no longer scan my receipt. I don't always have my phone with me while shopping. It looks like I'll be missing out on a bunch of savings. I used to enjoy this app but not any longer.
4249,Island Boyz,"March 8, 2019",5," I like the Walmart app cos I am able to save my recipts & see what I bought, it also helps me bugdet my next grocery shopping by estamating, by knowing the price of products on the recipts before hand, other stores don't do that, this is good."
4250,A Google user,"February 18, 2019",1," this app was wonderful, but since Oct 25, it shows none of my receipts and no money back. I scan every receipt and nothing. very disappointed since the new format was released"
4251,Rune master,"November 28, 2018",1, Horrible after the change. Can no longer enter receipts after checking out. Wal-Mart associates aren't able to answer questions about how the app works now. Wal-Mart change the app back!

4255,Jamie Parrish,"March 15, 2019",1," why even call it ""savings catcher""? I hardly ever use it now that you can't submit reciepts. The only good thing about this app is that you can scan items in store and find the price SOMETIME (not always)."

Thankfully each of them got declined, but all the attempted purchases were from Wal-Mart. There is even still stuff sitting in my cart that the thief left in there!! I want to know EXACTLY what happened here, Wal-Mart--what is actually going on with our card information in Wal-Mart Pay?!?"
4257,A Google user,"November 26, 2018",2, Used it primarily for the savings catcher. With the last update they only take the e receipts so you no longer get the rebates on items purchased in the store when they find a lower price. Defeated the whole purpose for me
4258,Trisha Dailey,"November 17, 2018",3," Walmart, you took away the ability to scan paper receipts. Now I won't bother with the app because the Savings Catcher was what I used and I'm not going to hold up a line of people while I get my phone out, bring up the app and scan a code at the register (when I actually remember to do so)."
4259,A Google user,"March 9, 2019",1," My account was deleted due to a complaint that you can't use savings catcher with grocery pickup!! Now all my reciepts saved in the system are gone. Poor customer servive on the phone, wanted to continue transfering me to different departments to try and resolve their mistake."
4260,m h,"April 8, 2019",1, app was working fine til the update. Now it keeps closing. I've sent reports but continue to have this issue even when reinstalling. Also when shopping there are alot of repeat items shown & items in my store are not up to date.
4261,Josh Me,"November 9, 2018",1," Wal-Mart changed is so you can no longer scan receipts for savings catcher, but receipts still have at code and say you can scan them with savings catcher and Wal-Mart pay is broken.Way to waste my time and others! Wish"
4262,Becky Reed,"December 20, 2018",1, I would give it a 5 star if I could actually scan my receipts when I get home. One of the reasons why I got the app in the first place. I am only keeping the app to look up certain items that my store might not have.
4263,Harmoni Davis,"April 22, 2019",2," I use to love this app but lately I have been unable to sign in, it keeps asking me to verify after i log in, and having me pick pictures over and over and over. I don't have time to play around with this. I'm trying to buy groceries."
4264,Kevin Jacques,"February 1, 2019",1," can not scan QR code or pin code, it's been this way since you cobbled everything together in one app, please fix this ! savings catcher is absolutely worthless if it doesn't work! update 2/1/19 this POS APP still doesn't work!"
4265,Gayle Hendricksen,"December 8, 2018",2," Since the update, any receipts submitted have not been reviewed. I get no savings rewards. Contacted Walmart with no response. Frustrating. If not fixed, I will uninstall as it's not worth the time."
4266,Bruce Cash,"December 6, 2018",1, Slowest app ever... It takes the patience of a saint to use this horrible app. Took all the resources of my Android so that I really couldn't use any apps and drained my battery to boot. Just uninstalled .. don't waste your time
4267,Tiffany Smith,"November 21, 2018",1," was using this all the time when i didnt have to link my card. Now that they changed savings catcher, I will no longer be using this app. NOT linking my card to something/an app that keeps getting hacked!!"

4273,Scooter Daniel,"October 10, 2019",1, I look at products in the Walmart app and then ads for those products appear in other non-Walmart apps with links back to Walmart. Great app if you want to have your Walmart viewing history appear in multiple apps. Some helpful features if you don't mind the Big Brother tracking.
4274,Heather Vieira,"October 24, 2019",5," I love this app, i use it everytime im in walmart.

First of all its complete garbage that Walmart doesn't accept any electronic pay app but theirs and then when I tried to use it it didn't work. Lastly after leaving the store I received a receipt for the person's purchase behind me so my account information was open and readily available to be charged for her purchase. Luckily she used cash because I believe had she noticed she could have charged my card for her purchase. Extremely upset, never using this app again."

4320,Ms. Swain,"August 2, 2019",1, I downloaded the app for photos. It took over 30 minutes for only 6 pictures of my album to purchase prints from to upload. I waited longer for my remaining images to upload which never happened. App does not work for me. Uninstalling.

I get a company has to increase profits but this is stupid. On average i spend about $200. a week at walmart to save maybe $1.00 on the fake sales you find elsewhere. With the new updates i can only pay with walmart pay to submit a receipt to savings catcher. Your app doesn't support the same account on more than 1 device. Which means i have to be there or my wife can't use the app/savings catcher. Now instead of increasing profit you lose $200 on sales because she will just go to another store if i am not there. Each time i am not there, she goes elsewhere. Here is a suggestion, stop putting the cart before the horse put it back so you can scan receipts. You are inconveniencing your company out of sales."

Unless I can get cameras to catch it
4410,Clyde Davis,"October 31, 2018",1, I used to use the app all the time and save the money for Christmas presents. The recent change makes that impossible. I removed the app. There is a Frys/Kroger right next door. Saves me gas.
4411,Julie C,"January 12, 2019",5," absolutely love this ,Having the convenience of doing my shopping at home and on the go. the customer service representative was so helpful and the whole ordeal has been an amazing experience I will absolutely continue to do this from now on!"
4412,mintiskies,"September 16, 2018",5, AWESOME! And you can even find people's lists! Great app! Deals for your local store and it's just too much for me to handle. It's awesome!
4413,Kristy Joyner,"November 3, 2018",5, Very convenient. I'm use to a paper receipt so when I walk away (from self check out) without a receipt I feel like I did something wrong.
4414,OlBoy Ben,"January 14, 2019",3, Overall a good app. Very beneficial. Could use a simpler interface for returns though. Maybe add layaway as an option when that returns. And lastly make delivering to the store and store pick up less difficult.
4415,Joshua Jones,"November 2, 2018",1, The app was great until they eliminated the ability to scan a receipt in the Savings Catcher feature. We pay in cash and don't share an account when using cards.
4416,Tracy McLellan,"April 7, 2019",1, garbage. can't get past the security features making you check images to verify that you're not a robot. went thorugh it 20 + times. very frustrating.
4417,Karl Werner,"March 23, 2019",1, used to be an excellent app. for ages we ordered medicine. the scanning feature was impressive. now we can not connect to pharmacy. what happened? you tried your low compensation sceme for IT as well? that does not work right now🤣
4418,Cristal Salazar,"May 21, 2019",1, I keep having issues when trying to log in to the app. I put in my info and then it has me choose images that have a specific item in it after I do that it ends up saying error logging you in. what do I do?
4419,A Google user,"March 11, 2019",3," it takes forever to download, it took 30 min just for it to download whenever it says installing its like it doesn't want to and it takes forever, but other than that its great 👍"
4420,Brian Ebel,"November 4, 2018",1, With the updated saving catcher system one hiccup will crash the system and deny you the chance to add a receipt or be able to pay if you decide to use the pay portion without having your credit cards on you.
4421,Larry Parlet,"December 22, 2018",1, worked great until November 2018. Now I cannot get my savings catcher money out or submit my new receipts for additional rewards. Store personal very nice but they don't have any idea why it does not work. Starting to shop elsewhere for groceries. Rosaures is the best option so far.
4422,Michelle Roberts,"October 30, 2018",2," I liked the savings catcher. Now, with the changes, it's worthless. All it did was make it more difficult use. I'm not going to remember to use this app every time I go to Walmart. It was better before."

4429,Tim Rees,"June 23, 2019",1, Definitely not a fan of this app isnt very friendly if your making a wedding registry especially since the cashier's dont know how to take it off the registry so know we will probably habe a bunch of duplicates target still has the actual scanner an way easier to use
4430,Outdoor Dude,"July 4, 2019",3, I'm unable to sign in to my account. I keep getting error. BUT I have no trouble signing in thru the website. I have tried deleting data/cache and uninstalling/reinstalling the app but no go.
4431,Michelle Plymale,"July 25, 2019",5," So easy to use and the option to set the store location you're shopping in as ""my store"" makes searching for products while in store such a breeze, giving the aisle locations of what you're looking for saves time and energy."
4432,Brenda Caputo,"September 19, 2019",2, This app worked fine at first now everytime I use it it will freeze up. I have to go out of the app and go back in wth. And a lot of stuff is out of stock for a long long time.
4433,Lavern Swinton,"September 27, 2019",1, I have a new Samsung S10 and installed the app to login my account. My login reads error and prohibits me from continuing.

4440,Dell Higgins,"January 4, 2019",1, Not worth it. They've complicated the savings catcher feature which is the only reason I installed the app. Now it's a pain.

4453,Savhannah Vigil,"December 26, 2018",3, I'm ok with the update. I don't like how it makes you pay thru your phone in order to accept the reciept. or the fact that it asks me to submit and confirm the reciept. doubling on work
4454,Shawn Rivas,"March 21, 2019",1, i am also deleating the app once savings catcher is gone. there's no use for the app otherwise. Walmart does not have the lowest prices on everything all the time either.

4457,Catherine Travis,"November 13, 2018",1, I absolutely hate the way Savings Catcher was changed.  I am uninstalling the App- forcing users to pay with Wal Mart pay is unacceptable -people use different methods of payment at different times.  cash/debit/credit

Scenario: in app i clicked on item of choice ... said one price and available for pick up if i went to a particular Walmart store. So i clicked on it for pick up. It came up with a significantly higher price and required shipping charge. At this point i decided to go to the store and work this out. Wrong! If i can't get 1 item using the app that says it is in stock and available for pick up tell me why i would give them a multi item grocery list!!! My last comment to the manager was this: ""all i heard was a number of excuses from you. An apology would have helped immensely. I'm deleting the Walmart app."""
4516,Chris Cote,"March 14, 2019",1," Stupid App. After several dozen attempts to login, the ""I am not a bot"" and pic the pictures that match a particular code word, keeps giving me.. Can't log you in Error. It's useless... you can't access it!"
4517,Debbie Gordon,"November 14, 2018",1," What has happened to Savings Catcher?  I can't install the new app because I don't have a phone that will accept it.  I have money in the old savings catcher and don't know how to get it out.  This is ridiculous, I want the old way back."
4518,Tara Tolbert,"February 11, 2019",1," the new way you have to use and enter receipts is time consuming, the people waiting in line to checkout don't like to wait. if you forget to enter your receipt you cant do it later. thats why im deleting my app."

4520,Tj Murphy,"January 7, 2019",1, i can't update my credit card info in saving catcher. if i don't have my phone to use walmart pay i can't submit a receipt into saving catcher. the app is no where as good as it used to be.
4521,Jean Clark,"November 1, 2018",5, Much easier and faster than going to the store. Plus I love that I can scan for a price since the shelves are never marked!
4522,Aram Porrata,"April 29, 2019",1, the app Is great does everything I need it to. only thing that pisses me off is that every time I go on my phone the advertisement always pop up constantly its very Annoying. just because of that I'm deleting this app.
4523,iam savedme,"April 24, 2019",2, I keep trying to upload my photos but it gets almost all the way to the end and then says error. I just want to have my photos printed and mailed to me

4525,Alyssa Puryear,"March 14, 2019",1," Savings Catcher EPIC FAIL!!! Can no longer just take a picture of receipt thru app. Have to have a smart phone, and a credit/debit card saved thru Walmart Pay to use savings catcher. Can only redeem savings at register with all the above. NOT HAPPY"
4526,Sandy Seas,"January 22, 2019",5, Love this app. Sometimes inventory doesn't update though. I like to know what's available before I shop because I want to get in and get out. Don't want to have someone go in the back and find product; that's only criticism.
4527,John Clingingsmith Jr,"March 3, 2019",1," If zero stars was an option that's what it would get. I download the APP in the store and after the 20th time of trying to answer I'm not a robot with pictures I gave up and uninstalled. Employees couldn't help either, junk!"

4530,Jess McDonald,"February 7, 2019",4," I love using this when I find unexpected deals and a great comparison tool I use when shopping for things on here and Amazon. One annoying thing now is when I use Walmart Pay at a store, I can't turn off using gift cards when I have more than one."
4531,Rachel Jerger,"November 16, 2018",1, This app used to be great. I loved the savings catcher. I dont use Wal-Mart pay everytime I shop. I want the ability to scan my receipts when I dont use Wal-Mart pay. Very unsatisfied with this update.

One week I had to just check out without using SC. The cashier did not know what to do. A few weeks later the same problem occurred. Finally a manager came along and assisted me and the cashier, who did not even pay attention to what is being done, finally the manager and I figured it out and I was able to use my savings towards my purchase. But, it was applied to the wrong debit/credit card.  I wanted it applied to Visa/TCF not Mastercard/Harris.  Not to mention, this held up the check out line considerably too long.  People behind me were NOT happy with the delay.  I was shopping at the WalMart in Elk Grove Village, Illinois on Meacham and Nerge roads.     I am not at all happy with this new way of using Savings Catcher."

4538,Cassandra Kemp,"June 29, 2019",5, My favorite feature is the receipt keeper. Scan the receipt and it shows you the items you bought as well as the protection plans you purchase. You can also access those protection plans and make claims thru the app.
4539,ThePotatoGod_-,"July 14, 2019",4," I do wish the app would allow customers to see what section an item is, but other than that, i have no complaints. Walmart Pay is super quick, receipts are easy to access, and item finder... gets the job done!"

4542,Alexis Reinbolt,"September 11, 2019",1, It says there are things stocked in stores that aren't or things at very different prices. It becomes frustrating when you go into a store to get something and it isn't the same. I wish they would keep the app more updated if they are going to use it.

It took 3 people's help to to get past the robot screen. Then it won't let me change my card and finally kicked me out. Back to the robot screen.
4612,Hahdom,"January 15, 2019",1, Completely unable to use the app as intended. Every time i open Wal-Mart Pay the app freezes my phone. Since they changed to being unable to scan receipts I now have no way to enter for the price matching.

4623,Hannah Spencer,"November 14, 2018",1, I think the change to the walmart catcher was the worst choice ever.

4645,Dianne Allison,"July 8, 2019",2, tried to make a list for pick up at local Wal-Mart and items I know are on the shelves are not on the app. Which makes the app useless to me as far as the pick up service goes. I may keep it for price checking but not sure yet.

4721,Fiona,"May 3, 2019",2, got the Walmart app for the pharmacy so that I didn't have to wait in line but half the time I got a call from the pharmacy telling me my prescription ready. The app does not say it's ready so I have to stand in line anyway. this app needs to be fixed or there's no point in having it.
4722,Tracy Scott,"December 6, 2018",1," App crashes on my phone; haven't been able to enter receipts since Savings Catcher was updated. I'm guessing that instead of terminating the program, Walmart has made the app impossible to use so they save money."

I guess the Walton family needed to add to their billions of dollars. 65ish dollars is a lot to me. this happened during their change. when you couldn't scan your receipts anymore. Now they tell me I don't even have an account but yet whenever I press on the Walmart icon my account comes up saying hello Kimberly. So what is going on do these people do not know what they're doing or what"
4726,Shara Jo Huff,"October 9, 2018",2, I loved this app until they announced that the savings catcher will only allow receipts from Walmart pay purchases...i can't use that form of payment EVERY SINGLE time I make a purchase.
4727,Dennis Hawthorne,"November 12, 2018",3," I generally only use the app for the savings catcher. Pretty upset I can no longer scan my receipts in. I refuse to attach my bank card for Walmart pay, and thats the only way to submit reciepts now."

4730,Tashie Williams,"March 19, 2019",1, I'm upset because the app won't verify me. I keep getting captcha images and always fails to verify me. It is very frustrating and upsetting since I use the app to do all of my Walmart shopping and use my card.
4731,Isabel R,"April 27, 2019",3," The creators instituted an in app capcha to login that loops endlessly giving ""incorrect"" results. My guess the screen is not large enough to show all the squares. They need to rethink it"

4733,Pammy Denise,"November 25, 2018",2," The app doesn't seem to have a way to search for Events registry like the website does, only wedding and baby registries which is pretty idiotic if you ask me. Probably going to uninstall soon."

4741,Alex Long,"June 8, 2019",1," This app is completely useless. I cannot sign in to even make a purchase.

Currently angry with this useless app because I cannot even use it for the reason I downloaded it- to make a purchase!"
4742,Matthew Ray,"May 8, 2019",2, App is ok. But the 25 different Captcha sign in is annoying. This app is more secure than most banking app. So it gets 2 stars till Walmart updates to a modern login
4743,A Google user,"December 6, 2018",1, This app USED to be great until they made it so savings catcher only works if you pay for your purchase with the app. Thanks a lot Walmart 🙄 I only keep it because half their items don't have prices on the shelves

4748,Supercollector16,"April 7, 2019",1, Keeps saying username and password are wrong. Makes me go through 10 captchas each time. Login works just fine on the website. Walmart needs to get this fixed.

4811,Amanda Shank,"August 7, 2019",1, Lock feature disappeared and it makes you call. Customer service is of zero help. I have placed 5 calls and uninstalled this app twice. Still not working. Fix this issue. Fraud happens so this now leaves our accounts unprotected from thieves.

4843,Leah Quackenbush,"December 2, 2018",1, Loved it until they changed so you have to use walmart pay for savings catcher. I refuse to sign up for walmart pay and i assume that is why they changed it - so folks who arent ok with using Walmart pay will lose out. Fail.
4844,Ralph Collins,"January 15, 2019",2, when they changed the saver app I can not understand scan while checking out. holding up the line trying to scan at the store and not scan at home with the receipt was much easier.

Cashiers and Customer Service reps don't know how it works and cannot make corrections to ad my receipts that were rejected. I am boycotting WalMart until they change their system back to allow us to pay with cash or with any credit card, and scan in our receipts. Other customers get mad when we hold up the line trying to.make it work."
4847,Miss Zee,"December 16, 2018",3," Use to love app. Changed the savings catcher to only giving you by saving your bank card info, without your pryor knowledge even. Not happy about this, so no more Savings Catcher for me."
4848,Kiki Will,"May 19, 2019",2, Great for price check! Now that Savings Catcher is discontinued and the stores have replaced the checkout lines with Scan and Go stations I no longer have the need for the app.
4849,Jean Minton Minton,"November 7, 2018",1, I can't get the app to work on my phone .It says submit and the universal code is put in but the date doesn't work and keeps saying update the app to submit. This stinks.
4850,David Macias,"April 3, 2019",5, Its been very enjoyable. I have health issues and have trouble getting around. And I reall dont like shopping. This app makes shopping easy!😀
4851,Marcia Rine,"March 19, 2019",1," I was perfectly okay using this app with the Savings Catcher. Now they are taking it away. As soon as soon Savings Catcher is gone, I am done with this app."
4852,Jen P.,"February 8, 2019",1, It used to be a great app but now you're forced to use a bank account or credit card through the app. So now you CAN NOT pay for your goods with cash!? Ridiculous! Uninstalling
4853,Victor Ulloa,"January 30, 2019",1," store check in doesn't work, and scanning at the pickup tower doesn't work either, i tried my phone at every angle. what a bad app design, took hours to pick up an Ethernet cable smh, i was ready to buy it instore instead of waiting."

4856,Loni Atton,"November 1, 2018",1, What happened to the Savings Catcher now not being able to add receipts?!     The submit receipts button has disappeared!  So are we forced to use the Walmart Pay in order to benefit from Savings Catcher?   11/1/18   Samsung Galaxy S9+

4882,A Google user,"October 12, 2018",1," Them getting rid of the ""scan receipt"" feature for the savings catcher is a terrible idea. They are forcing people to use walmart pay in order to use the saving catcher. So much for putting customers first."
4883,LaTiffany Bass,"October 30, 2018",1, Wal mart please listen to the many upset customers regarding the change to savings catcher. Please change it back. I like being able to choose how I pay for things and still get my savings. If this change never happens then I really don't need this app. It's just taking up space in my phone.
4884,Robert McDonald,"October 30, 2018",1," Took out savings catcher renderig the app useless. Scanning at a register confuses employees, holds up the lines while they search for help only to give up and direct you to self checkout."
4885,Hollie Stratton,"April 19, 2019",2, I liked this app until i started getting random ads on my phone when I'm not on this app. Ad's are expected but its fustating when your trying to do something else not related to Walmart.
4886,michael standish,"December 19, 2018",1, this apps loads all purchases from you store to the app based on your credit card so if you install it today you can see what was bought last month. This could be handy lol 1 star for creepy historical info so what I drink too much Monster totally busted
4887,John Pile,"March 29, 2019",2, 1. It keeps the walmart pay app open after you check out and pay.  It should close automatically when you get a received receipt.  2.  It wont let you cancel an initiated express return.  I still use the app but I am careful about the walmart pay part.
4888,Candido Haslup,"December 25, 2018",1, don't like the new saving catcher it need to go back to the old way . I like my savings to build-up with the new way you can't build it up
4889,Jennifer Vasquez,"March 10, 2019",1, This app sucks since it was changed. can not use my wm card on it. lost all my savings catcher savings and none are ever given ANYWHERE since the change. not user friendly. hard to navigate.

4891,Aquarius,"January 28, 2019",4, I like online site better.cause the search engine is way better. The only good thing about the app.is you can scan items to see the price of a item.

4898,K rulez,"November 9, 2018",2, Walmart changed the app for savings catcher. Can no longer pay cash and upload receipts. Must pay with app. Totally a bad idea. I pay with cash. Not fond of having my payment methods online but they force you now.
4899,Amber Smith,"November 11, 2018",2, I used to love this app especially the Savings Catcher. But now you can't scan your paper receipts to receive savings when you spent cash.

4901,Hannah Stripling,"March 17, 2019",2, I hate the way savings catcher works. it is a piano to have to open the pay during checkout just to use the savings catcher. it has also been glitchy.
4902,Lex Todd,"January 20, 2019",5, Really enjoy this app. Can scan barcodes in store to check prices. Even tell me which racks / shelves to find the products I search for! Really makes shopping at Walmart a pleasure!

4917,Jesse Taber,"August 30, 2019",2, I love this app other than the fact the tc# cant be manual typed in. My camera on my phone doesn't work well. So now its impossible for me to add my receipts.

4957,Canyousay Itsjustaname,"September 21, 2018",1," The app is mildly useful. However, even after turning off notifications and logging out of my account, it still pops up ads. Very annoying."
4958,Darrin Whaley,"October 4, 2018",1, It was okay until we were told that we're not going to be using the savings catcher anymore unless you use Walmart pay. Now it sucks. I will be on installing it on the 28th.
4959,Christine Silvis,"December 31, 2018",1," All I want is the pharmacy app, but I have to get the whole store app to get the pharmacy. It's advertised as a pharmacy app which is deceptive advertising. Just the pharmacy part would be a much smaller sized app and more useful by more people."
4960,A Google user,"December 1, 2018",5, Awesome very good deals and everything is better on the app because they have more cooler stuff than the store indeed download it if you are lazy or don't want to go to the store or something like that lol

These prescriptions are not interchangeable as my new Walmart is in Paris, TN and the old Walmart I used is in Lockport,  IL. Any help you can give to switch it back to my new Walmart would be appreciated. And yes,  my store is set to Paris, TN in the app. I emailed the website people a week ago and still no answer from them."
4962,kathy goldsmith,"November 5, 2018",1, Was good now useless for anyone that doesn't have a Walmart credit card. Without warning at all they dropped the scan in receipt option so if you use cash or your bank card its useless
4963,Andrew Murley,"November 6, 2018",2, Change the savings catcher feature back to the way it was and I will reinstall. This app is completely useless to me the way it is now.

I even checked in and turned on the GPS like it stated before arriving. I asked the lady if she was alerted that I arrived because a car pulled up after me and received his groceries before me. She stated that he called when he arrived. The app stated to not call and that an associate was on the way to give me my groceries. I'm not sure if this was a miss by the staff or the app, but I did want to report this so it could be investigated and not happen again. This was not a quick pickup as advertised. I would rather the app work as design, but to be honest I dont trust it. Unfortunately I am going to have to call every time just to make sure someone knows to bring the groceries out."
5003,Amanda Glover,"May 23, 2019",5, It can be a pretty reliable resource!!! Especially when you are in a hurry and most of the time I have to be in a hurry so this app has become my best friend.

5079,irma s,"July 22, 2019",1, everytime i scan an item. It would give me an error message or it would say it there out of stock. when im holding it in my hands.
5080,Sharon Blum,"August 9, 2019",1, Extremely slow & keep getting misdirected on search requests. Spend way too much time trying to get out of endless loops on what should be an easy one step process.
5081,Gina Williams,"August 21, 2019",5, I use this app for the Walmart 2 Walmart express money services. It has been a HUGE time saver and eliminates the use of 3 feet of printer paper. I even save a dollar on the sending fees in some stores! It's a win win!
5082,Donald Tracy,"August 30, 2019",1, I think it is BS to have to update app to use on my phone it took over 50 minutes to up date the choice to update should be my choice and not forced to do so the old app was working great l but a lot from Walmart both online and in the store l am not a happy camper

I get my order in the mail today it is dropped off by a moving truck not by a fed ex truck. my movie is damaged. I call them about this we cant have the protection plan movie to be replaced and told I'm welcome.
5192,Tiffany Howell,"July 19, 2019",1, I tried this app and I will tell you it doesn't make it faster. I still waited 30 minutes in line and waited for the employee to do all the processing that normally happens with a return. This app isn't worth the space on your phone.
5193,paul Baker,"August 3, 2019",2, latest update runs really slow bits per second are 0 then jumps upto 244 or so bits per a second. something really wrong there. funny enough the update says it increases performance. lol

5318,AD Van,"January 26, 2019",2," In store availability is not accurate. Frequently out of stock in the store when the app shows plenty available. App is only good for ordering online, don't rely on it to be accurate in store."
5319,DWAYNE RAWLINGS,"November 13, 2018",2, I Loved the app before they changed the savings catcher function. I use cash for most purchases.
5320,Crystal Leisure,"October 30, 2018",1, Loved this app until they got rid of being able to scan reciept at my convenience. It's useless to me now...uninstall!!
5321,Big Mac,"November 4, 2018",2," They changed the savings catcher and now you can't submit paper receipts, you have to do it in the store now, which is horribly inconvenient"
5322,Katie W.,"March 14, 2019",1, login verification doesn't work. I had to verify pictures like 100 times and it still won't let me in.
5323,Courtney DeLollis,"November 1, 2018",1, App used to be great til they took away the option to scan your receipts. Convenience and ease of use is gone for shopping in store
5324,Kay Kay,"April 28, 2019",1," Is this true? You guys are discontinuing saving catcher on May 14th🤔🤔 This is gonna suck. .Now how can we save? This was one of the best features on the app. If this happens on May 14th, I'm going to uninstall this app"
5325,ReiRei Robertson,"October 14, 2018",5, Great helpful easier way of convience for daily routine to be faster and less stressful then saving money and more rewards using this app.
5326,David Stransky,"December 12, 2018",1, Total pain in the ass. App constantly pops up wanting you to open it all the time. More than likely going to uninstall it.
5327,E,"October 31, 2018",2, This was a great app for savings catcher now they force you to pay through the app to use savings catcher. Well now might as well just shop amazon
5328,Tim Liebrock,"November 1, 2018",1, Keeps saying no network connection even though I have full wifi and data. Cleared the cache and restarted to no avail.
5329,Curtis Densmore,"October 14, 2018",1," App is misleading. It will display that a product is in stock, but they mean that it WILL be in stock on a future date. ""In stock"" means presently, right now. One more reason to loathe Walmart."
5330,Rick Rick,"April 22, 2019",1," Used 17% battery overnight. Notifications, haven't opened app in ages. Latest version clearly has a problem."
5331,Mike Johns,"May 26, 2019",5, this is the perfect app it lets you find what you are looking for before you go running all over town love it everyone should have this app
5332,A Google user,"October 29, 2018",5, I loved it for the savings catcher but I don't know why you guys got rid of that and now the only way to submit receipts is if you use Walmart Pay.
5333,Christopher Figueras,"May 6, 2019",1, The app does have really nice things...2 day shipping is amazing!!! BUT!! the taxes and nearly 6$ shipping costs for 1 item is ridiculous!!! The other vendors on the app do it for free..plus this app keeps shutting down my phone!!!
5334,Tonya Zuniga,"November 12, 2018",3, I wish that it would go back the way it was so we can scan our own receipt I like it better that way. I don't like the new way at ALL.
5335,Elissa Miller,"April 25, 2019",1, latest update is eating my battery even when I am not using it. Turned off background data and it is still eating battery. 15% on my last charge. why?
5336,Andrew Wingert,"November 2, 2018",4, Loved this app up until Oct. 29 when you took away the ability to scan a receipt. Not everyone is able to use Walmart Pay
5337,Jo Ann Beatty,"November 5, 2018",1," Savings catcher is now useless. I'm an associate and custo.er and Walmart has now found a way to screw most is customers out of saving money and ""living better."" No more ad matching, no more saving money."
5338,serenity Rush,"November 8, 2018",1, I don't like the app since the savings catcher changed. It's absolutely ridiculous that I have to use walmart pay during a purchase to submit receipts now.
5339,Amanda Vinson,"March 13, 2019",2, Walmart Pay hasn't worked since February. Contacted them about it and they kept sending me to different departments. Gave up. Hoping they fix it so i can start using it again.
5340,Rebekah Rogers,"October 15, 2018",5," If you shop at Walmart, definitely download this app!! If you use fetch rewards, it makes it so easy to load your gift card(s) to your Walmart pay and use it at checkout."
5341,Aventis Stravari,"November 29, 2018",1," Can't add protection plan. Was going to spend extra for it but if can't even add it when I'm only a few days in the purchase, which is stated on the website I can, then this plan is useless."
5342,mindy engle,"December 12, 2018",2, Use to love this app but with the new saving catcher its horrible you have to use Walmart pay to use the savings catcher unlike before when you could scan your paper receipt.
5343,Tracey Dye,"October 25, 2018",1, Was a good app but they are taking away the paper recept add part and the only way to add a recept is if you use the walmart pay will be uninstaling at the end of October
5344,tammi bailey,"March 13, 2019",1, Can not get the bar code scanner to work on this app. I was really excited to use this app until I got to walmart only to find the bar code scanner would not work for me.
5345,Shelly Harrison,"November 4, 2018",1, I don't like the new way the saving catcher is doing this. So how do you enter your receipt? What about the people that don't have phones and the app? It was much easier the other way.
5346,Cindy Marie,"November 21, 2018",2," It doesn't let me sign in. A message pops up saying ""Error signing in try again""! I'll rate it positively when this is fixed."
5347,Jeniffer Derry,"September 19, 2018",3," It's okay. But fix the Savings Catcher. Says you found lower prices, but then I check and doesn't show what you found."
5348,Jetta Smith,"November 13, 2018",1," Taking away the ability to enter paper receipts is ridiculous. If someone owes me 20 bucks, I'm not running to the bank to deposit it just so I can get my receipt entered!"
5349,Brenda Whit,"November 21, 2018",2, It's not capturing my receipts. All of my Nov receipts are not there. It hasn't captured any since Oct. Please fix it!
5350,Jennifer Miceli,"December 31, 2018",1," Why make Walmart Pay the exclusive way to submit savings catcher receipts? I can never get the app to load in store, so I'm unable to launch Walmart pay, and therefore cannot utilize savings catcher. Terrible change."
5351,Steven Dawson,"January 7, 2019",2," Does not always give quantity of items. Sometimes quantity is wrong, and the store is actually out of product. Might as well remove the phone numbers as the 3 locations I called today kept ringing... no matter the extension."
5352,Ray Smith,"June 4, 2019",1," The app worked fine until it randomly logged me out, and now it won't let me log back in. The app is useless now."
5353,Ashley McDaniel,"June 15, 2019",1, Waste of my time since there is no more savings catcher. And pop up ads everytime i use my phone from downloading your app. DONE.
5354,Joseph Geiger,"July 5, 2019",5, After a long time of making people search the entire store for everything you finally have a great Walmart shopping app where we can find everything in as long as it takes to key it into the app. Our Okeechobee store also has the new layout. Thank you Walmart.
5355,June Bailey,"July 5, 2019",4, dont need. the popups were a problem. a lot of times when i was in the middle of something important.
5356,Olivia Bishop,"July 5, 2019",1," real problem! everything says ""photo not available"" and won't load please fix! can't see anything!"
5357,Heidi Hooper,"July 30, 2019",4, The app is good but Photos take a long time to upload. I like that I can print and mail them from my phone though.
5358,Mama St Clair,"July 26, 2019",1," Its takes up a massive amount of storage and is sooooo slow. I hate this app! Make it functional and take up less space and I'll reinstall it. For now, it isn't worth it."
5359,Alex MacGregor,"July 10, 2019",2, this app is so slow to open on my phone and it glitches and crashes a lot. no other app does this! it can be convenient over the mobile website bit it's such a hassle

5364,Buster Brown,"September 6, 2019",3," Used to use the app all the time because I am an employee but after updating to android 10 everything that uses the camera no longer works. No Walmart pay, no price checks, no scanning codes."
5365,Robert Cassman,"September 7, 2019",4, Good app. Suggestion: give us the ability to reorder our shopping list by location. You already give us what aisle it's in. But it would be great if the app reorders it for us based on what aisle it's in.
5366,Muhammad Hanif,"September 11, 2019",3, With latest update it always get stuck when you are in Walmart store and try to use. When try to place order online it always pick some garbage in email and phone that's not even in your profile.
5367,Doreen Cianci,"September 13, 2019",5, Excellent! Just discovered the ability to scan receipts that can be accessed if needed through your purchase history!!! No more hunting for receipts.

5444,Heather Taylor,"November 21, 2018",1, Black Friday shopping was horrible. My cart would never load for me to pay. By the time it loaded everything was out of stock. Very upset and disappointed. If you are going to promote online shopping then make sure your system can support it.

Their Walmart Pay feature takes forever to open on my phone due to poor connectivity in their stores. There is no wifi and poor signal to any tower while inside.

5585,Helen Franks,"October 29, 2018",2," Really Walmart pay being the exclusive way to submit a receipt! This was one of the big perks about the app, was being able to scan my receipts in. I sometimes get money off my card and using Walmart pay you can't do that."

5599,Timeka Bolden,"June 30, 2019",4, They just need to work on making the pictures match up with the actual price and not put the lowest price range and show a high value item. It deceives the consumer.
5600,Jerry N,"July 3, 2019",1," I down loaded the Wal-Mart app back when you could scan receipts for the savings catcher, now that they have done away with that method, the app is useless to me."

Walmart just wanted to know what you were buying so they could make a knock off. they aren't fooling anyone and their brand is trash. id rather pay more locally and only go to Walmart if nothing else is open. which is never anymore since our Walmart closes at 10. Walmart is a generation, at best, of going the way of TG&Y, Woolworths and Kmart, and it couldn't have happened to a greedier group of inheritors. Sam Walton would be ashamed."

5842,Robert J,"August 19, 2019",1, app was great but to use it with my assoicate discount i have to have a payment method so i cant just use cash???? should have a cash selection.....
5843,Robert Vandiver,"September 4, 2019",2, Make the item's clickable in cart and ordered item's so people can save as favorites. And put a slider of related items for comparison.

5897,Miss Tiff,"July 13, 2019",4, The app is user friendly and convenient. The only thing I'd change is incorporating or combining Walmart Grocery with this app so that the user isn't directed/has to have a separate app installed.
5898,Toyah S.,"August 3, 2019",1, I love the idea of the app but it never works. Esp when im in the actual store. very slow .

We use up to 3-4 types of payments at the store So most of them are not allowed on the app like food stamps and cash.
