1,Ray yacub,"April 8, 2020",3," While the app allows customization of burgers, I feel like the fries are left out. Personally, I love well done fries, but in this case it's not an option. Nor is a option to ask for condiments"
2,Casey Spivey,"April 19, 2020",3," The CC scanner didn't work for me. Not that big a deal, though."
3,Russ,"April 16, 2020",5," Easy, no fluff, worked great."
4,Marc vachon,"April 17, 2020",1, This app is horrible you should be embarrassed you can't even do anything everything you put in the app keeps crashing tells you to try again later literally it's worthless
5,L G,"April 17, 2020",5, Quick and simple
6,Jonathen Woodman,"April 14, 2020",5," Simple app, perfect!"
7,HW P,"April 12, 2020",4, This app needs comments section.

I've never had their food before, so I decided to give them a try. I ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger and regular fry. I'm in LOVE with their food! Their homemade fries reminded me of my Dad's growing up as a kid. My burger melted in my mouth. I'm drooling just writing about it LOL I highly recommend 5 Guys Burgers and Fries. Thank you for making my dinner yesterday, you're very much appreciated!"
9,D.J. Brien,"February 26, 2020",1," Cant apply a gift card and pay the remaining balance with a credit card. And once the gift card was applied, I wasn't able to use it in the store. Not rocket science to set this up. Look at any other app."
10,Rodney Stowell,"March 31, 2020",4," Works well, would be nice to be able to notify on app when getting curb side."
11,Stephen Jurczak,"January 23, 2020",1," Used to work fine, but now no matter what credit card I use I receive an error stating that my billing address was incorrect, so the order doesn't go through. Meanwhile, I get a spending alert that my credit card was just charged the full amount."
12,Corey Haynes,"January 26, 2020",3, Everything was great except it wouldn't let me apply a small gift card balance towards my bill that didn't have enough funds to cover the entire bill. I now have 2 gifts cards with a little money on each.
13,chad meysenburg,"November 22, 2019",1, This app doesn't allow you to order. When you submit your payment it doesn't accept it. Then later it charges your card numerous times without ever submitting your order to the selected location. If you use this app make sure you check your bank account.
14,Ron Miller,"March 12, 2020",1," Error message preventing me from using the app. ""There was an error processing your request. Please try again later."""
15,Christopher Larter,"January 28, 2020",1, Unable to place my pickup order now. They've removed the ability to order a fountain drink.
16,Nick Soave,"November 9, 2018",3," Seems like a good app, but there is no way to add textual details to customize your order like to ask for light salt on the fries or two bottom buns due to a sesame seed aversion. There are options for no bun, but that's not what I want. Unfortunately that's a deal-breaker for me."
17,Maria Garcia Zapata,"February 16, 2019",3, Love the app & the ease of ordering ahead of time. My only issue is that there seems to be no rewards program which every other place offers. I was under the impression that there was with app use guess five guys hasn't quite caught up yet.
18,Jeffrey P. Joyce,"March 21, 2020",5, This app is really fun and I've enjoyed playing all the different scratchers.
19,Zachary Gross,"July 10, 2019",1, non-operational. i think i was able to successfully order one (maybe two times) out of a dozen attempts. usually the order ends in some error and after 3 errors you are stuck with an error that said you tried to order too many times. but i guess its a good menu...
20,Tony Tabb,"May 15, 2019",4, It's a great app but you can't order milkshakes on here you also can't tell them to make the fries before you get there since you have to drive 10 minutes to get to them. An area for special instructions would be nice.
21,Wayne Thomas,"November 27, 2019",1," This app sucks. The moment you sign in, your giving a choice to order pick up only never showing the deals or specials. They don't even honor veterans day!"

Bad credit card entry? Network problem? Problem with my specific restaurant's location? So i have no idea whether the problem is temporary or if i should expect it to work in a future attempt Why should i keep it installed?"
23,Mike Jones,"March 11, 2020",1, I shouldn't have to scan my card everytime I order. Annoying
24,Kieley Burkey,"February 28, 2019",2, Found one key thing that kills it for me. Can't split-pay. This means I can't use my gift card unless I want to buy stuff worth less than what's on the card. I can't use the entire balance then pay the rest on my debit/credit card. Please fix.
25,Alaina Leighton,"November 18, 2018",1," Everytime I order through the app, my order is never ready in the time frame that it gives me.

26,S Young,"October 7, 2019",3," App's very good - if you can use it. Worked great on my Moto X with Android 7, but not compatible with Moto G6 with Android 9"
27,Tom Castello,"June 22, 2019",2, Terrible time estimates. I usually add 2 to 3 times the estimated time for food pickup. App works great othet than timr estimate which isnt even close to accurate.
28,Patrick Keefe,"August 30, 2019",5, Easy to use. Can easily customize my order. Saves me time so my meal is ready each time I get there. Could not eat there and finish during my lunch break without it. Thanks!
29,Brian Cotton,"December 20, 2019",1, Uninspired waste of a download. No discounts or insentives for downloading. No heart.
30,Devin Brezgiel,"January 21, 2019",1," I tried to order some food with this app, the app told my the order could not be placed but charged my card 3 time. Now it's taking several days and a lot of phone calls and I still haven't gotten the $45 back.. don't use this app"
31,Todd Hamilton,"December 5, 2019",1," APP ORDERS ARE NEVER READY WHEN YOU GO TO PICK IT UP. Either the app sucks, or you wierd burger making does. 6 times I habe ordered using the app and its never been ready. They wont start it until you get there and ask for it."
32,LA Butler,"January 5, 2019",1," app doesn't work anymore, period. nothing but errors on everything that u tap on"
33,Darrin Peters,"November 4, 2019",3," I don't understand why they wait to drop the fries everytime you order from the app, I order to be in and out not wait the time it takes to make the burger. I call ahead usually but sometimes they don't answer. They should make it a button when you check out."
34,George F,"November 2, 2019",1, Tried to place an order but the app would not accept ccard payment. Checked ccard info several times. Five Guys app is totally useless
35,Retselom,"February 18, 2019",1," With location service turned on it will show nearest location to be the next town over, happened multiple times on pixel 3 xl running stock android (duh)"

38,Jarrod Kuriger,"June 12, 2019",4," All in all great app. One little niggle is it always gives estimated time of 7 minutes, regardless of current orders."
39,jamey hindall,"June 18, 2019",5, best burger in town app works awesome when you click regular or lite or extra they actually do what u say every time I have used the app they got it right it deserves a 6 *
40,April Tarwater,"July 28, 2019",1," I strongly discourage anyone from using the app. It told me the closest store was 10 minutes away, I went ahead and ordered from that store, I then followed the gps link in the app that took me to a place that did not exist.

I then called the store to find out where they were and they were 30 minutes away from me. I have no complaints with the food itself"
41,Nicholas Pate,"September 26, 2018",1, What kind of idiot developer doesn't understand that there needs to be a way to split payments or else people won't be able to use their gift cards when the balance gets small? How infuriating.
42,A Google user,"October 14, 2018",1, Tried to order but said the store was closed and it wasn't. App doesn't work if you don't update the info properly
43,aGregory Newton,"July 7, 2019",2, when making a order the app gets stuck at 1 location and will not update your location
44,D. T.,"April 17, 2020",1, Not a very well made app. They keep marking my order as complete and I still end up waiting 30+ minutes before it is really ready. What's the point in having an order status if it is always wrong.
45,Eric Moffat,"May 8, 2019",1, never works. always get error at last step.
46,Poody Plays,"June 6, 2019",2, Very minimal app with no nutrition facts or rewards.
47,Frank Borgman,"April 17, 2020",1, Keeps crashing. The order may or may not go thru. Go shop elsewhere.
48,R Br,"April 7, 2020",1, Placed order and did not receive all items ordered. They did not provide refund.
49,Denise K Mason,"April 23, 2020",1, App keeps crashing any won't let me place an order.
50,Gerald Kimbley,"March 13, 2020",1, I clicked on the 5 Guys that was 2 miles from me and ordered. The app sent to the wrong 5 Guys and I couldn't cancel the order. I had to drive 13 miles away. Why would the app do that? It should automatically default to the one closest to you. It couldn't even send me to the 5 Guys that I chose.
51,sasha pierce,"February 23, 2020",1, Said that I wasn't connected to the internet and wouldn't let me review my order. I find it easier to just go to the website and order there. Its quicker and works better than the app itself.
52,Andy Ocampo,"April 18, 2020",5, Five Guys are one of the best burger I have ever eaten.
53,codemonkey,"April 17, 2020",1, Kept crashing for no reason

55,Brandon Kronstedt,"January 15, 2019",1, credit card not supported at this location is not my problem
56,Frank Kotarski,"May 25, 2019",2," Their ordering system must be down. Couldn't place an order after trying three times on both the app and their site, with a different obscure error message each time. Five Guys definitely needs to invest in QA and stop faking reviews."
57,Kiliko Steinmetz,"May 28, 2019",1," They don't actually make anything until after you get there. This app is next to useless if your trying to save time.

ABSOLUTELY REDICULOUS. Get it together!"
58,Samantha Fisher,"June 14, 2019",1, this app is horrible... put in my zip code and the location it gave me said it was 4 miles away turned out to be 7 milea away by the time i got there the burgers were cold the fries were soggy. I have never been let down by five guys the way i was lwt down tonight...

The whole point is to kick your order over to door dash, so save a step and go through doordash's app if you're so inclined.

65,Justin Szul,"October 13, 2019",5, Works fine for me.. Not sure why so many negative reviews..
66,D. Brent Walton,"December 27, 2018",1, The app offers no perks. At least their competition offers a frequent buyer program.
67,damon gurule,"December 8, 2018",1, Me and my girl ate here and got so sick from food . Would have went to hospital if I had health insurance. And the app sucks too.
68,Thomas Leary,"August 1, 2019",1, changed my default location elsewhere... and i cant pickup where I am. defeats the whole purpose of the app...
69,A Google user,"September 28, 2018",2," No option to pay on site. Also, the whole point of ordering ahead is to have your food ready when you arrive. They don't actually make your fries or shakes until you show up. Completely defeating the point."

71,sue Lomeli,"November 8, 2018",5," Great food, wonderful staff"
72,Samantha Handwerk,"December 27, 2018",5, Love being able to order and pay on the app and then just pick up my food.
73,Brian Levine,"June 13, 2019",1," Every time I use the app it takes over a half hour to get my food. They know how to take orders, but the people on the stores don't know what to do with them. The whole thing is a terrible experience."
74,Letitia Young,"May 17, 2019",5, Great App easy to use

Thanks to a policy of not making the fries until you are in the store, you have to wait no matter what.  Don't use the app? You're going to wait. Use the app? You're going to wait. While you may wait marginally less time using the app, to me it's splitting hairs.   I really don't see the point of this app thanks the to the ""Fresh fries"" policy. Odd that they would let the burgers loiter in a bag but not the fries.  It is Five Guys Burgers right? Not Five Guys Fries? Oh well off to delete this app."

144,Caran Martin,"December 18, 2017",4," I love the food and being able to order while I'm still at work. There is one issue with them having a different order number in the store than the online order confirmation  has. They have your name on it, but call out the number - a number you don't know."

They don't drop the fries until you get there, and in my case I waited 20 minutes longer because they never cooked the fries and just forgot about me. People who technically ordered after me were getting their complete order and leaving. This seems to be a trend with this app. In their defense they did try to make it right by offering free food. Still irritating."
146,Rob Napier,"December 18, 2017",4," The stores have a policy of not making your fries until you arrive, to ensure freshness.  This is a quality measure no doubt, however defeating the time savings by the mobile ordering.  It would be nice if the app had an option to make my fries NOW or WHEN I ARRIVE5"
147,Gregg,"April 24, 2018",3," Have to wait to have fries cooked every time, what's the point of app and 
speed when have to wait 5 minutes for fries. Understand freshness but user 
can accept being on time or if late on cold french fries. Anyway Five Guys 
has good burgers and fries."
148,Ryan Freeman,"May 19, 2018",4," The app does exactly what it should. No extra screens, no fluff, no ads. 
Login, order, pay and go. Very convenient and very easy. Only 4 stars 
instead of 5 because it does not allow you to place your order then pay in 
cash when you pick it up."
149,A Google user,"June 14, 2018",1," The app is pointless! Maybe it's just the location I go to, but I STILL 
have to wait in line despite already ordering. Then I have to wait even 
longer for the fries to come out. What's the point of ordering on here if I 
can't skip the line???"
150,A Google user,"April 19, 2018",2," The food is fantastic. The app, while it works, is pointless since they 
don't make the food until you check in at the register. Why bother ordering 
ahead of you have to wait anyway?"
151,Expressive Pets,"June 2, 2018",5," I love this app. Easy to use. Pay in the app. You can save your orders for 
fast re-orders. The fries and shakes are served fresh made, AFTER you 
arrive for pick up! 🍔❤️ Ideal for people that travel, find 5Guys 
ANYWHERE!!!!!!"
152,Notch Johnson,"January 29, 2018",4, Great app!  Love the way they treat you special when you order online and pick it up! Just wish they would let you add items on the side... or extra bacon.   But they'll always hook you up when you get there!
153,David Cook,"March 26, 2018",1," Pointless! I ordered ahead with this app, and they wouldn't ""drop the fries"" (which is all I ordered) until I showed up."

304,Sarah Bryant,"October 3, 2017",5, Easy to use. Super easy to navigate. My favorite part is that it stores your previous orders so I don't have to enter each item every time we order from here. We order the same thing every time any how so just 2 clicks n dinners ordered.
305,Giamo Lao,"October 25, 2017",5," Only improvement I could suggest is that my store in Lebanon, PA doesn't have an option for milkshakes yet but they serve them. Not sure if milkshakes aren't available for online order at any store but if they were that'd be great! Food is great"
306,Cathie Miller,"June 22, 2017",2," Sadly, my food is ready but now it's cold. Really doesn't help to order via the app when they don't have a quick way to pay, or three shake ready when you get there. So now I get to enjoy my cold hitfog. Nevermind. B"
307,Shannon Evans,"July 15, 2017",5," It's already paid for, so I just run in with a $1 tip. My burger is always hot, fresh, and ready to go! The guys at Elmwood recognize me now, because I always order the same thing. (The trick is to never order fries or a drink. You don't need the carbs, and water is healthier too!)"
308,Bradley O'Connell,"July 5, 2017",4," Great app, you can pay with it, only gripes are that there are no special instructions and that they don't have the fries ready with your order. Also they should have more specific times than 15 minute intervals"
309,Liz Smith,"October 30, 2017",2, I could not order my food on the full site so I tried the app. It was a waste to download concidering I still couldn't place an order with the app. It will pull up the list of burgers but says that there is an error when I select one.

I'm just trying to figure out the exact amount my lunch will be after tax before I commit to it.
310,Robert F. Jobin Jr.,"November 29, 2017",4, This app got much better now that it supports ordering breakfast. Finding a store is still annoying if you're trying to find one near work but you are far away from there when searching.
311,Luke Ercanbrack,"October 13, 2017",3, I have to put my card number in each time I order even though I choose the option  to keep the card on file. The card scanner does nothing. I have to enter card info in manually. App worked better 2 versions ago.

I used the app. Went in, waited for my fries, they were having trouble making for some reason. Got home, burger was not what I ordered. I ordered a hamburger with all the fixin's... I got some soggy (too soggy to eat, bread) double patty burger with nothing but jalapenos, pickles, tomatoes, mayo (I think)... yeah. Just sucked. Terrible first experience. This happen to anybody else? I mean, for that price... it should be flawless. We're not in LA afterall... just Baytown. C'mon y'all! Disappointing."
313,Robert Hall,"September 17, 2017",2," When trying to add grilled anything, (onions, mushrooms, green peppers, jalapenos) it says regular is unavailable. You can't add them if you try to change it to lite, or extra either. Fix this and I'll change my review and rating."
314,Neil Caton,"September 16, 2017",2," The app does a good job of letting you order, but just sent an order to Norwalk as the ""closest store"" when I was 100ft from the store in Stamford 10 miles away. All location services are on, the app just can't manage itself or warn the user that it's deviating from what is normally done."
315,Nik Dillman,"July 27, 2017",5," Love the app, makes ordering easy for me since I'm Deaf and I don't always want to write my order down, now I can order, customize and pay for my food in the app and just show up at store and grab my food.  Love it!!"
316,Michelle Moirai,"October 16, 2017",5, Super easy to use. Placed my order. Payed for it in-app. Drive to the location and picked up my food. Could not have been any easier process.
317,Steven Degraziano,"November 18, 2017",1," Horrible app. Order from one location, it goes to a different location, automatically bill your card so you're stuck. Deleted it after one order"
318,Aj Vicknair,"November 21, 2017",5, Easy to use. The only thing missing is gift cards on the app.. Give me a gift card qr code or something
319,John Edinger,"May 14, 2017",3, It's great to order your food but you still need to go to the order window to tell them your here. I waited for 6 orders after my order to get my food. Might as well go to the register first.
320,Andrew Price,"August 3, 2017",1, What happened to being able to pay by app... defeats the whole purpose of ordering ahead of time
321,Amy Arensberg,"June 2, 2017",1, The app used to be great. Now you have to stand in line to pay instead of paying through the app. Kind of defeats the purpose of using the app.
322,Blauqkween,"May 16, 2017",5," Easy to order, saves your favs to reorder. Only change I would make is card should be universal for any 5 Guys."
323,Linda Yurche,"August 17, 2017",3," Great food, flexible ordering, but the app forgets my info every. frackin. time. Too frustrating!!"
324,Powdered-Toast Man,"June 6, 2017",3, I was hoping it would have promotions or coupons like the McDonald's app but it doesn't. Still convenient to order through the app though
325,Matt Brown,"May 28, 2017",5," Easy to use, clear info. Able to quickly order and see my order status. Definitely one of the best restaurant apps."
326,Nycris,"May 22, 2017",3," First time trying it, got a cheeseburger but the cook forgot both cheese and burger patties, got a new one pretty fast but still wasted time walking back, burgers really good."
327,Edwin Arriaza,"September 1, 2017",5, Be ready to pick it up in 8 minutes and you will have no problem. Nothing better than the interface. Simplicity at its finest. A checklist of the menu with the amount.   5 starz for 5 guyz
328,Danielle Geremia,"May 31, 2017",5, Best burgers in our little town! I'm gonna get fat lol :-D
329,Paulo Dos Santos,"July 13, 2017",4, Best thing I've downloaded got my food instantly after paying just wish you could pay from app as well
330,A Google user,"July 15, 2017",5, I love Five Guys burgers & fries the only thing is its a little expensive but if i could i would eat their burgers & fries all the time
331,Brandon Younger,"June 20, 2017",2, Order again should give you the option to change to location by default or they should at least let you cancel an order that was just placed.
332,Nob Odii,"July 10, 2017",1," Paypal promises to protect my money when shopping online. You promise to grill me a burger. I want to pay with paypal, not trust burger jockeys to store my card info on an app. Give me paypal options please."
333,Kristyle 78,"October 28, 2017",5," This app is AMAZING! I have used it twice so far and will continue to us. I would suggest adding an ""instructions"" section to include how you would like something cooked but other than that, this app is great! Thanks! :)"
334,Mike Phillips,"October 19, 2017",2," The app works well. It doesn't accept Android Pay! I don't like giving my credit card information to apps, especially with so many companies being hacked these days."
335,A Google user,"May 14, 2017",4, Good app. Easy to use. Wish could select more pickup times then just every 15 minutes.
336,Bruce Fleming,"June 30, 2017",2," Doesn't provide quicker service. Could have ordered in store, had it, and been on my way. Boooooo"
337,Hope-Leen'da Chambliss,"June 22, 2017",4, I like it better than before but a check in feature would make it great - like when you're about 5 minutes away. Seamless delivery.
338,Bruce Larson,"September 18, 2017",5, A simple order app for convenience...  There is nothing to get wrong.  I have a 5 guys in my neighborhood. this app is awesome i order my food walk to the store and it's hot and ready when I get there.
339,phill0676,"May 15, 2017",3, Be careful to verify the store it auto picks for you... I was within sight of the store I wanted and it placed the order 3 miles away 😕

347,John Tilton,"July 21, 2017",1," this used to work great, order while I'm walking to my car at work, have my food 10 minutes later when I arrive at my local five guys. Now the app can't find any location near me at all and it's become totally useless."
348,Derrick Southerland,"May 22, 2017",5, Super responsive app! All app devs should treat this speed as the gold standard.
349,Amanda Hutton,"July 7, 2017",3, Loved this app till it said there was no stores near my location which there obviously is cuz its right down the street....
350,Meng Pan,"November 14, 2017",5, This app is technically the official give guys app (partnered with olo). I had ordered several times and works great!
351,Burt johnson,"October 26, 2017",4, They forgot my beacon on my beacon cheeseburger... so I ended up with just a cheeseburger but paid for a beacon cheeseburger.   Too late once you get home!

356,Tudor Payson,"October 18, 2017",2," Often sends orders to the wrong store, ""nearest store"" function useless."

358,B Young,"August 23, 2017",4, My food was supposed to be ready at 442pm. It was not ready until 503pm. I had to wait several minutes when I was hoping to walk in and out with my food. I do like the app though.
359,Shawn Bisco,"September 6, 2017",5, Love their shakes! Dip your frys in too! Best fry and shake combo around!
360,A Google user,"May 23, 2017",3, This app is good but it needs to give an option to pay in person at the store

362,Santos Halpar,"November 4, 2017",2, It never saves the payment option I've put in multiple times who h is incredibly annoying but other than that it works fine.

366,Tina Tomasso,"November 14, 2017",4," This is a great app, it would be better if I could update my credit card in my profile, rather than at the point of ordering."
367,Kierre Brooks,"June 17, 2017",2, Poor communication between the app and the restaurant....
368,incognito Awesome,"November 28, 2017",1, Pointless app no faster then going in.....
369,Allemansrätten42 !,"September 9, 2017",3, There is no way to cancel or edit an order once its sent.
370,Jason Williams,"July 18, 2017",4, They really need to add some way to request condiments on the side. Other than that this would be a five star app
371,Leonard Harrison,"September 22, 2017",5, Easy peasy to use. Nice they are trying to speed service up
372,Christopher Utset,"June 6, 2017",5, Great app but it needs a no salt option for French fries.
373,Chris Racine,"November 15, 2017",4, Gift cards are a pain to use on the app
374,matt w,"November 2, 2017",4," Glitches seem to have been fixed,  working great now"

Never used another app for fast food this one works. Only one thing! Will be better  if they explain what is Cajun fries or regular fries. It will help to know what to order"
467,Scott Kiefer,"April 1, 2017",1, On app does not store credit card info correct. It erases the 0 from the front of #'s and won't process. Liked better before new update. If it won't work it's completely worthless!! way to go five guys stop people from ordering on your app
468,Adey Berhanu,"April 21, 2017",3, The app itself is great. Its easy to use and convenient. Maybe it's just my location but when I go to pick up my order I always have to wait like 15 extra min. That is a lot when your trying to make it on your lunch break.
469,Rob Murray,"March 23, 2017",1, Made order on app money charged to my bank account. Drove to the location. They didn't get the order. Even with proof they would give my refund or food. Horrible service.

Now (4 days later) there is a $130.32 hold on my account for 6 pending orders.  This is causing all kinds of problems now, and should not have happened.  There is not even anyone I can call to try and sort this out!  I will NEVER USE THIS APP again!!"
473,Amy Bache Herring,"January 5, 2017",5,"Love the food,  love the app! Such a time saver! It couldn't be easier.  The only thing I would like to do is be able to add the tip."
474,Stephanie Lee,"February 19, 2017",4," I love this app, just wish there was an option to notify the restaurant you've arrived. Waiting behind 5+ people in line to verify you've arrived is painful."
475,A Google user,"February 12, 2017",3, Disappointed in the new app. Doesn't allow plan ahead ordering. When you order you better be within 8 minutes of the store. It doesn't allow for later planned pick-up .
476,Steven D'Andrea,"December 8, 2016",1,"Can't pay with Card? Used to be able to, but with the latest update it doesn't seem to let you pay with your card... At least this was the case for me. There's no option anywhere... Other than that the app has always been great, but they need to add card payment again asap."
477,Rowe Palmer,"December 15, 2016",3, Didn't give me a payment option... I placed a large order for coworkers and myself... Every one had their own cards so I had to eat the bill and collect cash... A cash on pick up option would be awesome...

479,Amanda Lee,"April 22, 2017",5, This app is the only way I order my food any more.  When I arrive I can take it to go or eat there.  LOVE THIS APP!
480,Brian Wiedeke,"December 22, 2016",1,Update to the app sucks App worked fine before and you broke it. Said I placed the order but the store didn't get it. Get it together or lose my business.
481,Bethany Miller,"January 28, 2017",5," Obviously the burgers and fries (particularly the amount of them!!) can't be beat. I find the app easy to use. I think they just added the ability to re-order previous orders, which I like because we're creatures of habit. No complaints with the app."
482,Alex Romero,"December 14, 2016",3,"This app really improved, but.. This app improved with the latest upgrade but still lacks some important information such as indicating which are the ""all the way ingredients""."
483,Angela Jackson,"December 8, 2016",1, Waited 15 min once I got to restaurant for my order because the app did not tell me I needed to let restaurant know I was there to begin fixing my fries. App is pointless if I still have to wait for my food once I arrive.
484,David B,"January 14, 2017",5,"Highly recommended I wish every app work as well as this one! I am a customer of Five Guys and usually order online at home. Was out doing errands, and downloaded the app. Once I signed in it already had all my favorites and information. Made a few adjustments and submitted. No complaints"

486,Jennifer Gleaves,"February 23, 2017",5," Fast download. Extremely easy to navigate and order.

They even call to confirm your order once you place it so make sure your number is out in correctly lol"
487,Stacie Teer,"January 23, 2017",3, Two times in a row I asked for extra cheese and didn't receive it. Clerk behind desk never spoke but expected me to speak and seemed annoyed to be helping me. 530pm 1/23/17 foreign person

489,Dennie Williams,"February 28, 2017",2, I open the app and tells me there is no locations near me.um we eat there all the time. I go to map and I see no five guys. So this app is useless if I can't even get it to know where it's locations are.

492,Peg Fugleberg,"April 9, 2017",4, I would give a 5 but hate that they don't start the fries till you show up? So WHY order on their app a head of time?
493,wicked me,"February 28, 2017",3, Said my order would be ready in 8 minutes. I get there 25 minutes after I placed order and still had to wait 10 minutes. What's the point of ordering ahead of time to pick up if it's going to take 35 minutes to get. This was supposed to make my wait time shorter.
494,Joshua Lewis,"January 24, 2017",1, It's just a easy way top order no coupon codes or good deals for having the app underlying pointless

After I ordered, the app did that the food would be ready in 9 minutes and I was 15 minutes away. When I got to the restaurant, I waited for my order to be called. After the rest of my party of 6 people went through the line and got their food, I went to the order counter, asked about my order, they printed a receipt with an order number and that's when they started making my burgers. So, even though I had ordered and paid 15 minutes before everyone that showed up 20 minutes later, my order wasn't placed until I went to the line. Ridiculous."
497,REGINALD BELLAMY,"April 14, 2017",2, Since the  new updates the app no longer allows you to pay online with card would  like the option to pay online. Food is great now improve the app.
498,Jacqueline Lowe,"January 8, 2017",5,"One suggestion though! Would like to suggest you add a moment where specific instructions can be put, or the option to get things on the side!"
499,Lawrence Williams,"December 15, 2016",4,"Works great but local store not used to it yet I love the convenience of using this app but the local staff doesn't always recognize how to look for a ""web order""."
500,A Google user,"December 27, 2016",3,"Good update but needs continued refinement I like this workflow, but I feel the smaller font without the icons makes it harder for the list selection. Also it would be nice to be able to ask for toppings on the side."

502,David L Barnes,"April 15, 2017",4," Nice & simple app to order great burgers & fries! I only wish I could order no-salt fries. There is no comment field for the fries. If you like to eat around noon, you need this app to beat the line."

The hamburgers ended up being ready 15 minutes after ordering and they would not give me the fries in the order until 30 minutes after I ordered it. People who came in after me and waited in the line got their food before me. It took 30 minutes to get my food and the burgers where cold but the app said the order was completed 8 minutes after I placed it which was not true. Another negitive point is the app doesn't tell them when you arrive like other chain fast food places apps. Basically the app leads to longer waits and cold food.
507,Lindsey Beeney,"February 14, 2017",2, Why doesn't it accept gift cards or pay cash option? That would make this app better if I could pay with something other than a credit card.
508,Edwond Wilson,"January 4, 2017",5,"Great app Galaxy S7 Easy to use and straight to the point. Would be nice if they had a field for special prep instructions, but I can understand why they dont."
509,Pat Dempsey,"March 30, 2017",3, Clingy storing credit cards. Is red yes or is gray yes? Why not use green and red?
510,A Google user,"February 27, 2017",5, This app is super easy to use. I love that you can save orders incase you are craving something different or want to easily load up your favorite combo.
511,John Kang,"March 16, 2017",2, This doesn't select the nearest store for you and i ordered from store that is 25 minutes from where I was and there was no option to cancel even right after you submit. Had to drive almost an hour to get a hamburger

513,Tagonn's Let's Plays,"March 10, 2017",5, They as far as I know of have the best burgers recommend going there to eat and the App allows you to place an order while you sit at your table.

521,Matt G,"March 30, 2017",1, What's the point? The store will not begin making your order until you arrive there so why bother spending any time on this app?
522,heather Black,"February 25, 2017",5, Very convenient to orders on the App.  I'm a mom of a toddler so talking on the phone is sometimes a challenge.  Orders are always right and staff is very friendly
523,John E,"December 10, 2016",5,"Great app This is smooth and concise. Good interface. You just need to show what ""all the way"" includes, I didn't see that at this version."
524,Michael Heinrich,"January 25, 2017",3, 1. Needs default phone number & other phone numbers stored in settings so don't have to input for every order.  2. Should note stores with milkshake options with an icon so we don't need to click every stores menu.
525,Joshua Mack,"December 5, 2016",5,Love the redesign! The redesign makes the app so much easier to use.
526,andrea sanchez,"January 9, 2017",5,Nice! I really like the update. Much better interface and I like that can ask for extra pickles when I place my order instead of asking when I get there.

And yes it's true. The second you place your order, the app charges your credit card, and tells you when it will be ready. Just go to the restaurant, go past the line to the cashier, tell him or her you placed a ""Web order,"" and they know immediately.  Your order will be waiting for you, except for the fries, as the restaurant insists that the be as fresh as possible; not waiting around getting cold.  But since there are usually fresh fries already being made, there's no wait for them,  either.  Just download the app and use it to save time and enjoy a great meal!  Just one issue though: If you need to update or change your credit card (payment method), you first have to go to fiveguys,com, sign in (there's nothing that says ""sign in,"" but you will find that option under ""Sign Up""). From your account page, remove y our credit card. There is no way to add a new one in, or to edit existing card info, i.e. update expiration date.  The only way to add your card - again - is when you place an order using the app, it will ask for your card number at check-out.  It's easier to type on the larger Website, but hey, what can I say?"

It is in very poor taste that Five Guys thought their user base didn't deserve an explanation for why they suddenly needed such unrestricted access to our devices & information. At the time of this review, the only explanation provided (if you could call it that) was: ""Support for new in-restaurant technologies"".

I'v tried a handful of the chain restaurant apps, and this one is my favorite. Simple and straightforward to place an order. I'm holding on to the 5th star until the order timing in the store is improved. It seems to be a best effort approach. As far as I can tell, my order just gets in line with everyone else at the store. I think that is great. Just give me a status. Tell me my order has been received. Tell me when it will be ready. The 10 minutes I spent waiting in the store on Friday are understandable, but I would have much rather spent that time doing something else. I was not entirely sure my order was being prepared. Still a great app that I will continue to use."
811,Dan Eagen,"June 7, 2014",2,Its ok It is full featured but requires a credit card. I pay cash so this app is worthless to me.

I wish it would just default to my online login, let me set my location and not try to find it every goddamned time.    HOWEVER.  The online ordering - by home PC or via my cell phone carrier- was so streamlined and seamless! And quick! After you've submitted your order, it says it will be ready for pickup in 10 minutes. I'm about that far away, and it's ready to go when I get there. The menu was easy, adding extras to a burger was everything you would want - click a topping, then it asks you: regular, light or extra? For each one. I only give this 3 stars because there's no need for the app. Online ordering works better than any ordering app I've used across the board.   The app for this sucks. I'm glad I don't need it."

However, I wish you didn't have to enter a credit card in order to order online, I wish it would allow cash pick ups.  Especially since sometimes I have cash on me and don't feel like charging anything.  Also, when I save an order as a favorite, next time I'm in the app I can't actually access favorites.  Will give 5 stars when this is something that can be done."
908,Mark Alston,"October 4, 2013",4,Saved orders While the app tells you you can save an order to quickly reorder it later there is no way to actually do so.  You can look at your past orders total cost but not simply reorder it.  Please get this feature working as we almost always order the exact same thing every time.

When I arrived to the restaurant, and let them know I was there, they informed me that not only had the ticket not printed on their end until my arrival, but that the app had also changed my ready time to 40 mins passed my requested time. They said they run Ingo this all the time, and recommend ordering from their website (at least until the app is better).  So we got to stand around and wait for our entire order to be made."
910,Darryl Thompson Powell,"May 4, 2013",3,"No explanation for 'All the way' One of the topping options is 'All the way' but no explanation to what is included. Plus for the veggie it automatically generated some toppings for me. So when I selected all the way and didn't delete the toppings it auto-filled, they didn't make my order so I still had to wait!"
911,A Google user,"June 15, 2013",5,"Simple App for A Simple &Delicious Burger It's easy to use, but I'm not a person who has the need to special order a burger.

912,Zacharie McClain,"February 3, 2014",4,"Easy ordering, no cash option The app works really great (Galaxy S4) and ordering was fairly intuitive.

Nope.  For the first several times I started up the app, it would crash with a server certificate problem. After finally getting past that,  it had trouble locating a restaurant in my area. Finally, it would crash and force close every time I tried to add something to my bag. By the time I gave up and uninstalled it, I would have spent far less time by just driving to the restaurant and ordering at the counter in the first place. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Uninstalled."

1054,A Google user,"June 10, 2012",5,"Delightful time saver—perfectly done When I'm out and about, I pull up this app, select my usual order from favorites, and the shop has it waiting for me when I get there.  Five Guys took the time/resources to build the infrastructure and do the employee training so that the whole thing works like a charm every time.  BRAVO!"
1055,A Google user,"February 20, 2012",4,"Works Well. The app works well, and for those uninitiated, the burgers do too! Only thing preventing 5 stars is a post-order time estimate.

1056,A Google user,"December 30, 2011",4,Good intentions We waited and then asked how we would know if our order was ready. They said we had to confirm the order first. what is the purpose if we have to wait in a line?? is the credit card info not a good enough confirmation?
1057,A Google user,"April 20, 2011",5,"Fantastic Don't listen to reviews saying you can't see the menu. You CAN. Create an account, select your store, login and its all right there. Works great on Xoom as well which is a great plus! 5 stars for the app. 10 stars for the food!"
1058,A Google user,"June 6, 2012",5,"Galaxy Nexus - I used it almost every time we go there and love it.  The store gets busy, but I walk right up and got our food.  They wait until you arrive to drop fresh hot fries into the bag. One of my top apps!"

I would give this app full stars if it had a complete selection of the options that are available in store, as well as the option to pay cash at the store.

1060,A Google user,"November 26, 2011",5,"Great app Idiots, call and order if u want to pay with cash. Can u imagine how many fake orders would be sent with this app, without CC. Stop bitching"
1061,A Google user,"May 18, 2011",5,"*participating* locations This is a great app for ordering burgers when I'm in a hurry. To those dinging it for not having their store in the app - check their website - it says ""participating"" locations and offers you the ability to search for stores near you that participate."
1062,A Google user,"June 14, 2012",4,"Great, but favs suck Love the flexibility and convenience. Only downer is u can't copy your favorite order from one store to another. Otherwise works well"
1063,A Google user,"March 7, 2012",5,"Great app I agree with previous suggestion of as post estimate time. The ready time only works if there's no traffic related issues, and they aren't inundated with orders. But other than that, it's a great app."
1064,A Google user,"May 27, 2012",3,"Needs a bit of tweeking. Works MOST of the time. it also bases its taxes from the city your area code belongs to, not from the pick up locations city. So I would like to see that changed."
1065,A Google user,"January 20, 2012",5,AWESOME Great for when im at work! I can order and by the time i get there its ready for pickup! And you pay on the app so you just walk on and grab your bag fill your drink and leave!
1066,A Google user,"April 13, 2012",3,Update for plain orders Doesn't allow for plain orders. I get to the restaurant and they say my order is incomplete because I didn't add toppings. I don't want toppings.
1067,A Google user,"April 19, 2011",5,Awesome! Just when you though Five Guys burgers couldn't get any better...BAM! This app comes along!

It transmits to and from the server with EVERYTHING you do (and freezes while it does so), such as getting a list of toppings everytime you try to order an item.  This ends up taking so long that you might as well just go there and order in person and wait.  The smart thing to do would be to put all toppings in a single file and transmit it once when the app starts.  Then, when you complete your order, transmit it ONCE to the server instead of continuously ad hoc.  I only gave it two stars because it actually works...eventually."
1069,A Google user,"November 30, 2011",1,This App is a scam!!!!! Every Time you order using this APP you get a charge 0f $1.00 for your trouble. It makes a hell of a lot more sense to call and place the order. I am very unhappy that I wasn't made aware that I was going to be charged for using the APP each time.
1070,A Google user,"June 3, 2011",3,"Somewhat rocky experience I submitted an order for immediate pickup and arrived at the restaurant about 20 minutes later. They hadn't even begun making my order, so I ended up waiting about three minutes to flag down an employee, then another six or seven waiting for my food to be made."
1071,A Google user,"December 7, 2011",5, Awesome app! Simple and easy to use. Shows the closest with all info. Long lines? Order w/ the app and bypass them all!!!
1072,A Google user,"March 2, 2012",3,"It's O K..... The app functions fine but you can only pay with a credit card, which I guess is fine unless you want to pay with cash."
1073,A Google user,"October 18, 2011",5,Love this app! I literally can't think of anything else I want this app to do except deliver the food to me or work with other restaurants. Flawless!
1074,A Google user,"December 15, 2011",5,"What every resturaunt should do! This is awesome! Log in, see the nearest store. Place an order, review it, pay automatically, then get GPS directions! Well designed, easy to use."
1075,A Google user,"September 21, 2011",4,Easy to use! Love how easy it is to use. Just wish they have a button for xtra items like for mayo or mustard. Other then that great!
1076,A Google user,"December 30, 2011",5,Fixed Times Can't get the hours to work in my area so it won't let me do anything. Worked the next day awesome!

1078,A Google user,"October 28, 2011",5,Yes!! Oh hell yea!  What else can I say?   A heart attack in a bag. LoL.   I LOVE THE FOOD!!!!
1079,A Google user,"January 21, 2012",4,Works perfectly! Two suggestions: Give the ability to manually enter time of pickup instead of drop down choices and have a section for special instructions/requests. Great app otherwise!
1080,A Google user,"December 27, 2011",3,Add gift card payment I want to use my gift cards instead of my credit card. Also let the user put in their zipcode instead of using gps.
1081,A Google user,"July 14, 2011",5," I agree!Absolutely awesome app! Every, and I mean Every restaurant that does any kind of takeout should have an app like and as well designed as this!"

1108,A Google user,"October 3, 2011",3,3 Stars for Five Guys Not too expensive but I would rather have a bigger burger for the price.  In & Out is a better value.
1109,A Google user,"October 16, 2011",5,Great app. Easy to use. I like the app and the food! :)
1110,A Google user,"October 30, 2011",1, No phone #. We drove 10 min. In the car and we got there before we could finish ordering. Would be WAY better to be able to call.

1160,A Google user,"March 13, 2011",3,"Missing a few key things... This app is missing 2 key things. 1. The ability to call up saved orders (you can call them up online when you're signed in, but not on the app) and 2. The ability to modify toppings (lite, regular, extra) as you can on the website. For now, I'll stick to their mobile we page."
1161,A Google user,"May 5, 2011",3," Should add a skip gps ability at the start of app. Also, didnt have the five guys I was looking for making this useless."
1162,A Google user,"November 17, 2012",1,The app is not the problem. The crappy rating is because of crappy Five Guys policy where they won't make your fries until after you arrive to pick up your order.
1163,A Google user,"July 7, 2011",3, App is a little buggy. When order is placed it hangs up on sending order for a long time and then reports an unspecified system error. HTC Speedy.
1164,A Google user,"April 22, 2011",3," Great app if you eat 5guys. Directions need choice of navigation or map tho. Too bad their burgers and fries, suuu-Uck! *Gag*"

1177,A Google user,"June 27, 2011",5, Does exactly what it was designed to do. I love just walking past the register right to the pick up area. Food is ready and am on my way again. Great!

1250,A Google user,"May 4, 2011",5," Used it today for the first time, worked great! Highly recommended, order was ready at the time I designated"
1251,A Google user,"September 6, 2011",4,decent app should be able to choose time after order is placed and be able to view and change favorites before choosing a time of pick up. great app otherwise!
1252,A Google user,"April 22, 2011",5, It does what it says it will do. I placed order and it was ready when I got there.
