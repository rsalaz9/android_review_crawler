Lot of other weather apps bombard you with all unnessary information all at once, and it can make looking for what you need at that moment hard to find (and unpleasant to look at). For example, opening the Timeline shows detailed information about current weather conditions, and directly under that a ""card"" that shows conditions for the rest of the day graphically. Below that is another card that does the same for tomorrow in a clear and concise format. And rather than clutter the charts to show forecasts for each hour even though the temperature might be the same for the entire period -- that end up forcing you to scroll to see the rest of the day -- these chart summarize the period in a way only shows when there are increases or decreases, letting you see both the trends clearly. Brilliant! Even Dark Sky involved a lot of scrolling to see a single day's forecast (and only showed data every 2 hours anyway). Finally, the developer is extremely responsive and committed to future development of the app. So glad I found my new weather app. And great widgets too!"

Not too much clutter either. Rain forecast always shows ""heavy"" rain even when it's drizzle, both for current conditions and forecast. Not sure if that's a bug or it's coming from the weather provider"

I would say there are two things I would like to see changed. First, I would like to see the radar integrated into the app directly instead of redirected to a webpage. Second, I don't care for the bottom navigation bar. I do like bottom navigation, but I do not like the up and down scroll inside the bottom navigation. I feel that it is difficult to swipe correctly."

I like the design, but it has taken a bit of getting used to. The developer was very responsive when I emailed him questions regarding Dark Sky going away and it sounds like he has a good plan to keep his app high quality and reliable. Radar needs improvement but he acknowledged that and sounds like he has a plan for it. Location searching needs to show the state a town is in so I can get weather for correct town."

It is very easy to read the temperature as well as the feel like temperature, along with forecast details. The widgets are very clean and the developer of the app is very helpful with helping resolve certain bugs in the app with regular updates."

The data source is horrible. The data source says it is heavily raining. Actually, the sun is shining with about 50% cloud cover. I will keep the app and keep my annual subscription because I appreciate what what you are attempting to accomplish. Unfortunately, I must use a different app for accurate weather data. UPDATE: Changed my rating to 5 stars. More accurate than I 1st believed."

10,Victor Valencia,"April 21, 2020",5, Very good weather app. Layout is different from other apps. Notification alerts are really appreciated when rain and snow is on the way. Edit: Developer responded to my comments about the app . I appreciate the quick response to my suggestion and I have added a star to my review.

Hands down, AW is it. The same hyperlocal API, up to the minute notifications and forecasts delivered in plain and friendly English. Extremely active developer (Bardi) who's responsive and helpful. If you're a weather hound (and even if you're not, tbh) don't even think about it; upgrade for £4 a year for the widgets and notifications. Best 1.1p a day you'll spend."
14,Jennifer Silver,"April 18, 2020",5, Great app. I was having minor display issues with the widget and contacted support. Within the hour the developer responded and stayed in touch until the issue was resolved - an update with the fix was released in a matter of days!
15,Ari W.,"April 20, 2020",5," Appy Weather is beautiful, clear and helpful. Everything is well-presented, making it fun to check the forecast and current conditions. The developer is engaged and updates the app regularly. Highly recommended!"
16,David Rhodes,"April 21, 2020",5," One of the best looking weather apps with fantastic looking, well executed widgets. The developer is quick to respond to inquiries. Took me about 15 minutes to buy the $3.99 annual subscription for the added content."
17,Pete R,"April 12, 2020",5," Happy so far...looking to replace Dark Sky Initially, I was concerned with what would happen w/the app once Dark Sky is deactivated on Android.

This app looks good but it's getting uninstalled. Why? I like to access my weather through a widget.

19,ethan elson,"April 16, 2020",5, This is the most accurate and personal weather app I've tried yet. I highly recommend that you give it a try. It has lots of detail in an easy to understand format and there are not really any ads even in the free version!
20,David Dambra,"April 23, 2020",5," Seems like a nice app! As others have said, would be nice to have radar integrated into the app instead of bring directed to a web page. Other than that great job!"
21,Ken Mullet,"April 15, 2020",5, Looks like a very promising replacement for Dark Sky. The developer is actively working on improvements and has been very responsive to questions I've had. Thanks!
22,Thomas DeLucia,"April 11, 2020",5, I like the simple and easy to use design. Developer is making an effort to continuously improve and I'm happy to support! Great option if you are leaving Dark Sky
23,NAFEES RAKIB,"April 23, 2020",4," The most pleasing weatherapp I've ever used! Even in the free version, the way it shows adds, doesn't ruin the experience at all! Love the design!"
24,Rob Ropson,"April 14, 2020",5," I needed a Dark Sky replacement and Appt Weather is the best one. The widgets are great, the interface is minimalistic while providing a lot of info, and it gets frequent updates. Awesome app"

I've upgraded to support them and the radar feature is disappointing. It doesn't show it natively in the app, instead it loads a web page. And there's no way to play the radar sequence like in other apps (weather pro, weather underground,). So yeah, it's good. But it needs work."
26,Liam Gandelsman,"April 16, 2020",4," Really good app, seems to be the best dark sky replacement. Interface is a bit confusing but has potential. Excited to see where this app goes!!"

The use of cards is a good use of some Material Design-ish elements while having its own personality. Highly recommend trying it out. What I'd love to see added is some kind of upcoming precipitation graph - perhaps a way to bring the ""Later"" graphs into widget form. I like to litter my home screen with my favorite pieces of my weather app(s), and this is definitely now in my arsenal."
28,Harry Barnes,"April 12, 2020",5," Used to use Dark Sky? Use this instead. Dark Sky app closes July 2020, API is open until end of 2021. Great app design, well worded and good developer. Would be good to customise report times."

Regardless, Appy Weather is definitely a contender in the space. Some of the results I get are just plain wrong, and I do think the hourly interface is a bit strange, but I got used to it."

This will eventually have a negative effect on apps like Appy Weather, but it is my understanding this will start occurring in 2021. So if you like Dark Sky, after June, you will need an app like Appy Weather to access it. Hoping they can work something out to be able to keep accessing Dark Sky data. Or maybe come up with another way to keep going beyond 2021."

IMO precipitation chances and temperature should both be visible always or very easy to switch between. The UI buttons for choosing different locations and choosing different metrics are also very hard to accurately hit, and swiping more often than not triggers the navigation gestures."

That being said once there is any prediction required, especially in the immediate future this app does not perform. For instance, the app will tell me it is going to start raining in 15 minutes, but there is not a cloud in the sky. I might end up cancelling my subscription if this apps accuracy isn't improved. What good is a weather app if it can't predict the weather?"

However, it only offers a very high level idea of what the weather is and is expected to be. It lacks critical information such as expected snowfall accumulation.

Pretty much the best weather app I have ever used.

49,Mike Fata,"April 14, 2020",5, Happy to help these guys out now that the Dark Sky app is leaving. Looking forward to see where they go with content providers after Dark Sky turns off their data.
50,Lexington Tribu,"February 26, 2020",4," I really like the app and the way that it gives you weather information. It's simplistic and has minimalistic widgets. The only thing that is a negative critique, is the fact that there is no inbuilt radar. It is irritating to have to be redirected out of the app for radar info and updates."
51,Mack Rich,"April 16, 2020",5, Great design and weather data -- clean and clear. Helpful widget for upcoming weather.

59,Matthew Berger,"April 11, 2020",5," Really cool and well organized weather app, so far really loving it. Interested to see what weather API the app will switch to after Dark Sky becomes iOS only (boo!), but I'm know I'll stick along for the ride."

67,Mothusi Lehata,"April 10, 2020",5, I really just paid for a weather app lol. But is was totally worth it though. I do wish there was more customisation for the widgets. I love the layout of the app.
68,Ben Shirley,"April 2, 2020",3, Ok but I wish it had a better graph data type view. Also wish the timeline could be more compact and timeline data is sometimes less useful not always showing high for the day.

70,Scott R,"February 29, 2020",1, Purchased/subscribed to this app just to unlock the widgets and they don't work. Play store won't let me refund even though I purchased it just a few minutes ago. If you want a widget this is not the app for you - spend your money elsewhere.

73,JP Angelone,"April 2, 2020",5, Found this app looking for a dark sky alternative as dark sky is dropping support for Android. I sent the developer a quick question and he got right back to me. I have subscribed to it to get the extras. Overall very happy with the application. Does everything I need.
74,George Sutton,"April 4, 2020",5, The app has many helpful options and the developer has provided quick response to my request for information. I strongly recommend this app for your weather needs.

77,Ryan McConville,"April 3, 2020",1, I've paid for the subscription but it keeps telling me to upgrade. I can't use the widgets. I've given the developer money for nothing in return.
78,Life of Aedan,"April 7, 2020",5," I got this app after hearing about the shut down of Dark Sky. I wish the developer the best luck in finding new APIs. I love this app already, and wish it the best with corporate greed Apple."

It would be great if there was an option to switch. Edit: thanks for the quick reply. The other options would be great too in addition to roboto.

97,Mark Jacobson,"January 28, 2020",5," I have used a number of weather apps, and Appy Weather is now my favorite, given it's easy to get information, utilization on Dark Sky data, and the excellent visual layout. I run it on android 9 and it works very well on my phone. Highly recommended."
98,Anthony Walker,"February 4, 2020",4, Great app. The only annoying thing to me is that the 1x2 widget is not precisely centered in Lawnchair. Can't say if it also persists in the other launchers. Would be nice if that could be fixed!
99,Haythem Gataa,"April 3, 2020",5," Love it! Minimal UI, great UX. But I suggest adding more weather providers, dark sky's data is not accurate in my location. Also, not sure how Apple buying Dark Sky will affect the API"

I don't see any battery drain either which is a big factor for weather apps that alert in real time.

The usual information I want to see is clearly available straightaway. It gets my location right with no problems. At the touch of one finger I can see the weather for the next few days and it is represented in a clear manner.

The weather information is stated in a straight to the point manner, so it is quick and easy to digest. Very user friendly weather app."
108,James Robertson,"January 2, 2020",5, I was a Weather Timeline fan for years and struggled to find a suitable replacement. I am very happy to have found this app. I would describe it as having a similar feel to WT but the developer has ensured it's longevity by adopting a subscription model (which is where WT failed).

I'm not sure how you convinced Google to give you the award for app of the year, but I definitely would have voted for a different weather app. I have since uninstalled this app due to its incorrect information that it provided. I gave it a try, but I will stick to my Google Assistant. BTW, I did give the app permission to use my location. So that's not an excuse"
132,Urvish Maniyar,"December 13, 2019",5," Fantastic app! Really beautiful and clean interface, detailed forecast and weather in different modes(street, area, city). I'm using this app for 2 weeks and already it is my primary weather app. Good Job devs, keep doing great work!!"
133,Elton John Sander,"December 10, 2019",5," Very good app, what really calls my attention is the minimal design. I really like the big bold numbers, as the icons and rounded corners as well. Still can't decide what theme is my favorite: light or dark."
134,Piers Whiting,"January 2, 2020",5," This is a really nice user friendly weather app. Bardi the dev responded immediately to my original comment, so the fifth star and a donation. I then saw that he'd done Ruff, so I've downloaded that too. Both save to SD card which is an added bonus. (And he's in the UK...)"
135,Rajit Ramasamy,"December 9, 2019",5, Love this app. It is very simple and easy to use. It gives you a more detailed outline of the weather from daily to hours and a timeline. I love the widgets too. Definitely recomend this app. Thank you
136,Tyler Day,"January 13, 2020",5," Very simplistic and easy to use. More accurate than any other weather app. Instead of telling me the conditions of the town I'm in or near, it's very precise down to the street I'm on."
137,Vitor Pose Martinez,"November 6, 2019",4," Appy is great, I tested all the editors choice weather apps and this is by far the best. I have to cap my rating at 4 stars though as Dark Sky support/accuracy is really bad out of a few countries. So the app is great but the info it provides is not."
138,Chris Barnes,"January 23, 2020",5," Great looking app. It performs well. Wish it had more widget features such as transparency and a streaming weather update feature like stock tickers. Overall, highly satisfied with the experience."
139,Amanda Lawson,"January 21, 2020",5," This is a fantastic weather app. Not only is it rich with data like their other app, Dark Skies which it's also awesome), it presents your weather in a meaningful, narrative way. Def my favorite!"
140,Simon Anderson-Dry,"December 10, 2019",4, Can only give 4 stars because when you first add a widget to the home screen its invisible. You have to wait for a few minutes before the data shows but its disconcerting and not obvious that you need to wait.
141,Troy Colby,"December 23, 2019",2," Purchased the app for the radar. Only to see the radar does not have playability. If you want to see the future, you have to put the date and time into the radar. A rather useless feature."
142,Winju Vighnesh,"December 21, 2019",5," Beautiful weather app, the design is very modern with a simplistic approach which is very refreshing! The developer is very prompt in taking in the feedback and getting the issues resolved."
143,Daniel G,"January 14, 2020",1," It's ok, definitely not worth a subscription fee for a widget and the so called other features available. I would have bought the app but a subscription fee for a weather app is just greedy."
144,Séan Brazier,"December 18, 2019",5," Excellent app, dev really responsive and helpful. I've got a bit of a weather app addiction, and this one is very well designed, and really stylish. Well worth your money."
145,Jacob P Mathai,"January 27, 2020",5," The best weather app till date, very easy to understand but sad that only the paid version has alerts or notifications"
146,Jeff Bauder,"December 18, 2019",3," The concept of the weather app is great, but I can't give it a higher score until there are more choices of weather providers. Dark sky is highly unreliable in sparcely populated areas of the US such as the Midwest."
147,Steve Clement,"January 23, 2020",5, So the widget disappearing problem seems to be fixed. I appreciate the continuous hard work put into it. It's one of the best apps on my entire phone. Thanks!
148,eo cow,"January 21, 2020",5, This is a great clean weather app. Ads are non-intrusive (don't think I have even seen one yet) and the design is great. Would recommend!
149,jeremy bultron,"March 18, 2020",3, The review notification is annoying.
150,Bob R,"December 13, 2019",4, Comparing weather prediction with what I see out my window has been spot on. Can't get better than that. Would like to see a little more work on the radar. But this is by far the best weather app I've found.
151,Austin Frost,"December 25, 2019",5," This is very helpful, it is very accurate,it is very windy where I live and this app can know the speed of the wind,HIGHLY recommended"
152,Ramon Renault,"January 20, 2020",4, I like the design. Sadly Dark sky is very inaccurate in most of EU. Would be great to have other weather data providers to choose from.
153,Babak G,"December 8, 2019",5, Happy with the purchase and worth the few Euros. More personable than many of the weather apps out there. Honestly for the product you get the price is more than fair
154,paul harmsworth,"December 14, 2019",5," Just installed, testing at the moment, but looking like a great app..update, it working well haven't had any problems, seems to be spot on with weather ..i now giving 5 stars"
155,Andris Dinsbergs,"December 15, 2019",5," Super well thought out user experience. Minimal , so you're presented with the info most needed and customisable for any detailed info needed. The widgets are also a just as well designed."
156,K Spoor,"January 7, 2020",5," After using the free version for just over a day - bought the subscription without hesitation. Really like the data source, Dark Sky as a weather predictor."
157,B Lacasse,"April 10, 2020",4, Like it so far. What happens though when Dark Sky is an Apple product and this can't use them any longer???
158,Paul Howard,"December 22, 2019",4, Great UI design. Very intuitive and informative. I use the radar a lot on other apps. Not 5 stars because radar is only stationary. Would be perfect if radar function was equivalent to other apps.
159,robin tanner,"January 19, 2020",5," I didn't think I'd find a better weather app, but this is more detailed than any other. I opted to subscribe yearly for it almost immediately"
160,Rich Borkovec,"December 4, 2019",5," Great app with plenty of free features. It looks great, has easy to use controls, and the price per year isn't too bad at all."
161,Nick Jenkinson,"December 9, 2019",5, Really like this app. Have returned to it after a break and it has improved markedly. All the information you would want is there.
162,Dominik Machek,"December 19, 2019",5," Slick. Simple. Love the paid app. Radar, wind direction and speed for all of you boaters and sail sports. So worth it! Perfect!"
163,Matt Hogg,"December 21, 2019",4, The descriptive weather info is a welcome improvement over the data points that most weather apps provide. I only wish the radar functionality was more robust.
164,Ara Wagoner,"January 21, 2020",5," Great layout and lovely dark theme. I like the way that locations are displayed (my home is near WDW, so I set my default location to The Magic Kingdom)"
165,Vivek Tiwari,"November 7, 2019",5," Gorgeous design, minimalistic, lots of white space and still delivers the same amount of information as some of the detailed cluttered apps. And a very responsive dev."
166,Mihir Pancholi,"November 25, 2019",4," It has lots of creative concepts, Loved it ! ☺️ Worth it for premium purchase 👍🏻. But it is struggling with animation effects not smooth enough and data refresh time also slow 🧐."
167,Abilas Sathiya,"December 9, 2019",5, Solid weather app. Been looking for a weather app with a simple breakdown using natural language for awhile. Some things I'd like to see added are more weather sources and widget options (5x1 widget please).
168,Raj Maan,"December 14, 2019",5, This app is so good. It makes sense of the weather in a way anyone can understand. I quickly signed up for the premium for a minimal cost.
169,Lana Makdisi,"December 9, 2019",5, This app actually makes me want to check the weather. Been my daily driver for months and it continues to impress & get better with each update. Highly recommended!
170,Sushi Cat,"December 11, 2019",5, This app is GREAT!! All the weather predictions are RIGHT and I am so happy for this!! I introduced the app to all my friends! :)
171,Anneke Stagg,"January 8, 2020",5," Love this weather app. Beautifully designed and built, it provides exactly the information I'm seeking each day."
172,Elaine Robinson,"December 11, 2019",5," So far this app has been very accurate, which in itself came as a surprise, and I just love the graphics, really enjoy using"
173,Forrest Robertson,"December 11, 2019",5," Great product and great service by the developer when reporting bugs. Love, love, love it!!"
174,Toni Borysik,"January 19, 2020",2," Bit meh tbh particularly the widgets which have very limited scope for personalisation + mine don't update anymore, bit poor for £4/year subscription. There are many better free alternatives imo."
175,Dirk Wetzel,"January 24, 2020",1, The weather forecast for my area is almost always wrong. Right now it's says heavy rain and absolutely no rain anywhere. Switching back to AccuWeather.
176,Sarat Bikkina,"January 17, 2020",5, App has worked well and the developer seems to push out bug fixes at a pretty fast pace which is a good sign.
177,Marin Keser,"December 14, 2019",5," The best out there. Simple, sleek and precise. Just to add allergies/pollen alert, it would be the best app ever."
178,Jeffrey Malm,"December 29, 2019",5," Fantastic weather app. Just the information I need, in a well designed, easy to use and understand format. 5 stars."
179,Richard Grinnell,"January 20, 2020",5," I really like this weather app, well worth the cost. Everything is organized in an easy to navigate to what you want to see."

181,Pete Killingley,"December 10, 2019",5," Great developer feedback, I made a suggested change and it was live by the end of the same day! Great and helpful app."
182,Beakers Cool,"December 20, 2019",5," Best weather app on the Play Store, beautifully presented with detailed information just a tap away, well worth the subscription"
183,Péter Csizmadia,"December 19, 2019",5," Cool app, and the most accurate in Costa Rica by my experience. Also is nice to have a weather app which uses non scientific language."
184,Jai Ritter,"December 13, 2019",5, It has a really clean UI and quite accurate. I have a few weather apps and this is definitely up there.
185,Jeremy Clemens-Mierau,"December 22, 2019",5, The app is a beautiful piece of design. Every competing weather app is a disgusting beast by comparison. Dev is responsive too.
186,Nicole Soulard,"December 18, 2019",5, This app is buttery smooth and the developer is responsive and quick to fix any bugs. Highly recommend! Amazing weather app and well worth the subscription cost!
187,Javi,"December 20, 2019",5," Love the app just wish it'd use my location chosen in app for notifications and not current location as I don't have gps on. Any way to fix this? Other than that love it, thanks!"
188,Dan Pritchett,"December 12, 2019",5, I've been a long time fan of DarkSky so I was curious if this app would add value. It's absolutely a better way to view DarkSky data.
189,Frode,"January 19, 2020",2," Widgets unreliable. After update, widgets not working at all. Subscription automatically, why? There are better free alternatives out there!"
190,Luiz Alberto Camilo,"November 20, 2019",3," Very Nice app, but it consumes 20% of my battery on a daily basis.... Too much for what its supposed to do.... Uninstalling"
191,Geoffrey.R Hsu,"December 9, 2019",5, Great app with good design. The attention to the details worth every penny.
192,Theone6AAAAAAA,"December 19, 2019",2," Highly complex and confusing navigation, difficult and time consuming to find data easy to get ""lost"". Very plain widgets."
193,Steven Silvers,"December 11, 2019",5, This app has the best UX out of any weather app hands down and the free version covers all basic functionality you would want out of a weather app.
194,Ali Shams,"December 9, 2019",5," A great weather app. Simple design, user-friendly, accurate and very useful. Would definitely recommend it!"
195,Pete Thompson,"November 10, 2019",5," Well done, this app is so refreshing when you compare to more traditional weather apps. I upgraded to pro version straight off the bat."
196,Matthew Sheridan,"December 23, 2019",4, Very simple ugi and information accurate I would give it 5 stars if radar was able to show movement of storm systems not just a static display
197,Robert Vulic,"November 11, 2019",5, Very nice looking weather app with correct weather forecast. Developer is very communicative and constantly updates app with new things and bug fixes.
198,Russell Poole,"December 20, 2019",5," I reached out and they got right back to me about where to find light style widgets (in settings, instead of separately in the widget screen) Putting the temperature on the notification bar is worth the sub alone"
199,Ali Arab,"January 7, 2020",5, Very clean interface and easy . It shows the accurate location.
200,Stephanie Marie,"December 10, 2019",5, This is my new favorite weather app! I love the minimalist layout and the timeline format.
201,Tyrone Evans,"December 22, 2019",5," Galaxy S10 user, wow what a great weather app, consistent, provides daily and weekly logs. Nice interface to boot."
202,Darko Bulatovic,"December 21, 2019",5," If you are looking for light widgets after last update, just go into Settings, scroll down to widgets, and then change the Foreground colour to Light. It's now configurable in-app."
203,Diego A. Bell,"January 24, 2020",4," Good app, widget is a bit glitchy at times. Wish there were other styles as well for the widget."
204,Epiclifery Active,"November 15, 2019",4," A good app with decent Animations and performance, Though more Details about Weather can be added like in Accu Weather. Satellite View should also make debut on this."
205,Brian Grenier,"December 26, 2019",4," Why is it forecasting rain when temps are -8f??! Nice clean look, but still, rain? Something is wrong!"
206,Christopher Jensen,"December 6, 2019",5," Fantastic look, all the weather info I want, beautiful widgets and quick responses from the developer. 5 stars all day long"
207,Ege .Bilican,"January 18, 2020",4," Hi, I am unable to see more than the initial screen. Gps is enabled but the app gets stuck in loading screen. Samsung s8, city: istanbul/turkey Edit: started working now"

210,Santino P-H,"January 29, 2020",5," Love the aesthetic, well presented information and excellent range of widgets"
211,Troy Amiet,"December 3, 2019",1, Why would I pay when it doesn't have data (ie live radar) for Australia!! Should make it clear what is available and where before you pay then find out!!
212,Diane Todd,"January 8, 2020",5," Nice, clean, easy to follow. Could use a better radar."

222,Johnny Green,"December 9, 2019",5," THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT, ACCURATE AND NO ADDS. I DISCRIBED APPY WEATHER AS ONE OF THE BEST OUT THERE IN THE PLAY STORE. I ALSO GOT THE PAID PRO VERSION.

Coming from iOS to Android I was absolutely spoiled by Carrot weather's real time precipitation accuracy. I live in tornado alley so I rely heavily on my weather app's predictions, especially at night. I've only downloaded the app a bit ago and went ahead and upgraded to premium features, so we will see how well it all works. The reviews reflect positive involvement of the developer which is a great first step in all good apps."

When I found out Dark Sky will no longer be supported on Android I started searching weather apps and did not know Appy Weather is available on Android.

For me Appy Weather is the most accurate easiest to understand and even a bit fun to look at vs all the other weather apps. 5 stars!"

As I already am subscribed to dark skies though, I am a bit upset widgets are behind the subscription paywall. Widgets are quite vital to my needs as well as the temperature in the status bar.

269,Scott Conner,"February 25, 2020",2, Don't really like the fact that you have to upgrade to the premium app to see the radar and the fonts need to be in more Styles if you're going to let me pick too many free apps for the weather out there to choose from to have to pay even if it is only 399 a year

Appt Weather is really the only one that makes this simple. I get two notifications a day with a readable explanation of how the coming day is different from the previous one, and what to prepare for.

Other popular weather apps, including those on the Editor’s Choice list, are available for older versions of Android. Unfortunately Appy Weather is not. According to Google's Android Distribution chart,16.9% of users are still running Marshmallow. Furthermore, 19.2% users are still running Nougat. Considering these numbers, why would the developer make Appy only available for Oreo and above? By doing this, the developer has lost a combined userbase of 36.1% from Marshmallow and Nougat alone. This also includes potential in-app purchases as well."
