0,Khadija Afroze,"March 20, 2019",1, The app is designed really poorly. There was a promo for the first order that it refused to accept because it wanted me to login when I was already logged in. Restarted the app and it wouldn't let me check out as it couldn't validate the basket.
1,Tyler Horst,"March 28, 2020",1," Curry Up is great but do not use this app for orders. The app just sends your order to Doordash, but then when there was a problem with the order on Doordash's end, they didn't even have a record of my order.

The app just sends your order to Doordash, but then when there was a problem with the order on Doordash's end, they didn't even have a record of my order. My order was marked delivered but nobody ever even picked it up. Curry Up is great but you should just call in your order instead or go directly through Doordash."

Their app is poorly designed (keyboard blocks next) and they don't have delivery. And once you've ordered, you cannot cancel through the app and the phone number leads to someplace where you hear one ring and then you get disconnected. This is a scam, do not use this app."
3,Lisa Hanslip,"April 27, 2019",1, infuriating...argh! wouldn't accept coupon code for 1st order w app...would only let me check out without code...wasted 35 minutes trying to get it to work!
4,Doug Montgomery,"June 8, 2019",5, App worked well for me. Was able to successfuly use coupon code for 1st time discount
5,Josh Dorn,"March 29, 2020",1," I'll echo what everyone else is saying, don't waste your time. Extremely user unfriendly, poorly designed. I doubt they had any intention of actually giving people the coupon, just hoping that everyone gets frustrated and orders food from them instead. Pissing off your customers is a terrible busine...Full ReviewI'll echo what everyone else is saying, don't waste your time. Extremely user unfriendly, poorly designed. I doubt they had any intention of actually giving people the coupon, just hoping that everyone gets frustrated and orders food from them instead. Pissing off your customers is a terrible business model. I'm taking my money elsewhere."
