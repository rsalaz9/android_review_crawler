2,somil patni,"June 2, 2019",5, First impression... It's an excellent app and does what it says. Edit : Would love to have following three options that will go a long way in making this a top app: 1. Ability to crop or adjust photos 2. Ability to add videos 3. Some more filters please

to locate the pictures in the movies but here's the problem, for me tho 
pictures change too quickly and there is no way to adjust this, I want to 
be able to select the duration the pictures are displayed, I emailed the
