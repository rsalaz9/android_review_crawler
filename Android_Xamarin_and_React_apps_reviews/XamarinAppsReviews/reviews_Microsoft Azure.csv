Drawback includes limited support for actually controlling these resources. I would say use this app for checking the status of your Azure resources on the go. Hopefully future updates will add greater controlling capabilities.

Despite of successfully providing organization username and password and authenticating with Microsoft Authenticator App with code or even approve button, it simply doesn't login. Keep asking organization credentials again and then code and then again credentials and then code and again... Endless... This was never the case earlier.dont know what has changed. App is now useless since I can't login"
2,Larry Webb,"March 14, 2020",5," Microsoft Azure is the perfect platform used for many purposes including storage, database evaluation, and networking. I have had a positive experience with Azure and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't necessarily have the principal to buy the resources that Azure offers."
3,Avery Chua,"April 18, 2020",5, Good first experience so far. Easy to use and fast in speed. I move my SAP Business One to Azure from Newtek One. So much faster and economical than Newtek One.
4,Jovany Espinoza,"February 23, 2020",4," Portal functionality is very limited. Unless you memorize the commands to create resources, this application can merely be used for tracking and monitoring your resources. Room for improvement."
5,Cla Oijas,"April 11, 2020",4, Useful for alerts and see a quick status of your services. What would be really nice is too have also a cost dashboard.
6,Kris Deb,"March 10, 2020",2," Not much to do tbh. Useful for control the VMs and nothing else... I wish I had AAD, Intune, identity Protection, Azure Security Center, Sentinel dashboards minimum. At this state it's not Azure app, it's rather Azure VM list."
7,Nicholas Rogoff,"April 17, 2020",5, Great app. Works very well and allows me to manage my Azure environment very quickly
8,Jon Thwaites,"February 7, 2020",1," Completely pointless, I was expecting this to allow me to perform some administrative tasks on our tenantcy. It needs some serious work and features added for it to be worth installing."
9,Luk√°≈° Josai,"March 19, 2020",2," I am very disappointed, the UI sucks, there is no darkmode, you cant add or remove resources and the information available is sparse at best."
10,Ashraf Khan,"March 23, 2020",4, Amazing App. I would have given it 5 stars if only it showed me my Azure Credit Balance when I open the app
11,R S,"March 8, 2020",1, I cant acces AZURE DEVOPS board from this app. It seems the devop service is not integrated with Azure cloud. I wish there was a mobile app for Azure Devops boarfs.
12,Jeffrey Ingle,"March 5, 2020",4, All the extensions and add ons to gather up any and all system and file apps is amazing.I am impressed.

23,Andrew Madrigallos,"March 9, 2020",1," Useless app, information are useless, just stick to web."
24,Mike Surcouf,"November 11, 2019",1, This app doesn't seem to work if MFA is enabled.and device compliance is requested. The login shows Device Authentication Required - DeviceId -DeviceAltSecId claims are null Other apps such as Office 365 app seem to work with MFA and conditional access just fine

If i am running out of space somewhere, if i need to trigger a house keeping job. How does my Work Items queue look. What action do i need to take. Are there any pressure points building up in any of my architectures. What can i do now and what do i have to do in the office. What SDK is there to drive this app so i am always connected. What youtube vids are there to lever this tool - none."
26,Tim Brien,"January 31, 2020",5, Combining this app with the RD Client on a DeX mounted Samsung phone eliminates the need to carry a laptop!
27,Ivan Porta,"January 4, 2020",5, I use this app to manage my web applications instead of using the web portal. It has a friendly UI and offers many useful features.
28,Osarenmwinda Ohuimumwen,"January 4, 2020",5, The application is easily accessible and fast to deploy VMs.
29,Tuomas Hietanen,"January 17, 2020",1," Couldn't even add a firewall rule to a VM. Considering that Azure Portal website is buggy on mobile and cannot do it either, that is where you'd need this software."
30,K K,"October 31, 2019",5," Love it, saved my life a couple of times, was able to restart webapps while having dinner."
31,ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒöŒøœÖœÅŒøœçŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÇ,"January 7, 2020",5, A very nice and essential app offers a good look inside the vast amount of information in the Azure cloud.
32,Teja Swaroop Bezawada,"January 19, 2020",4, UI can be improved along with adding more features. Content refresh is a big concern with this app.
33,Bennett Cookson,"December 29, 2019",5, Handy for managing servers when away from computer and I find it much easier for simple tasks than full website.
34,Imran Muhammad,"January 8, 2020",5, One suggestion : Recent resources section should get cleared if the resources have been terminated. I had deleted VM but still showing in recent resources....
35,James Hinojosa,"March 12, 2020",5, Easy to use on mobile devices!
36,Bryan Smith,"March 27, 2020",5, Great app for Azure Admin on the go!
37,◊û◊®◊ì◊õ◊ô ◊ê◊ú◊™◊®,"January 4, 2020",1, Shows nothing but general resource information. I'd expect at least a liitle bit of information beyond resource name and ID. I can't even see the money spent for this month.
38,ssc134,"January 21, 2020",4, Fingerprint unlock feature doesn't work. And the app takes frustrating long to respond even on a decent device processor and a decent network speed.

Obviously, this app wasn't made to do everything the web interface does, nor should it, but I think something like costs is a good metric to have, and doesn't require user input so that should make the feature simpler to implement. Thank you for the great app üëç"
67,Miloslav Pawlica,"December 29, 2019",1," Useless, as most of new invetions from MS. Interface is poor, nothing interesting except starting stopping VM. When I try to run cloud shell, my device will crash. Even using Azure over desktop is pain."
68,Tam√°s G√°bor Szab√≥,"September 6, 2019",1," The name of the application is awfully misleading.

So glad I've chosen Azure. I can remote desktop into my VM from wherever I am, and even use my the Azure's built in RDC on my android tablet when out and about and it's just as if I'm sat in front of a high end workstation. Really love it."
75,Vishal Patil,"January 27, 2020",5, Great app to control azure resources !

78,Peter Wishart,"January 4, 2019",1, Doesn't work on my Samsung S7 with Oreo. I have just installed. It can't seem to start. Just shows the swirling circle like it is trying to connect. No interaction or messages. I gave up after 15 mins of waiting.
79,Sean Lyttle,"December 4, 2018",3," This app was so useful, but the latest updates has broken it on my OnePlus6. It just sits on its opening loading screen and refuses to proceed. No settings or options, just useless no. Please fix it quick!"
80,Bryan Ponnwitz,"May 21, 2019",2," This app might be good for some basic monitoring, but that's about it. I wasn't even able to change the time span for monitoring. It's basically next to worthless for doing anything other than that."
81,Will Westrop,"October 20, 2019",1," Incredibly limited. There is no access to logs, no monitoring of containers, no access to cost information, no ability to create new resources - it's pretty much just a read-only view of your subscription (and a very limited subset at that)"

369,A Google user,"April 15, 2018",3," Please add cost and billing features or the dashboard as a rendered view, otherwise ok."
370,Michal Kvasnicka,"April 4, 2018",5, Well done...!!!
371,Trent Robertson,"March 23, 2018",1," I can't figure out the purpose of this app. I can't even see a snapshot of the available backups, or settings or anything."
372,Yusto Omondi,"March 26, 2018",5, This is a great win for Azure users... And having the command line as well is great!
373,Casper Nielsen,"March 26, 2018",5, Thanks
374,James B,"May 16, 2018",2," Content can not be downloaded.... being able to actually watch shows seems 
kind of important. Installed the app to watch ""Adam Ruins Everything"". 
Apparently he ruined this app because it doesn't work. Back to youtube."
375,William Schutt,"March 6, 2018",5, You can do almost everything you can in the web portal.
376,kailash ravuri,"February 20, 2018",3, App is good for quick look at the status of your apps. But search and filter functionality needs to added at every level for now filter is only given to Resource Group level. Better use it on WiFi If you have lots of apps then it eats your data brutally.
377,Sean Kibbee,"February 21, 2018",3, Nice app for viewing basic things. Wish the online portal supported mobile better or this app did everything the web does. Can't see billing as far as I can tell so that's disappointing.
378,RAJAT VASHISHTHA,"February 15, 2018",3, Overall app is good but i don't know why i cant open cloud shell on my device it says oops with some very long number type id and closes??

383,Ashwani Kumar Singh,"April 7, 2018",5, Awesome application
384,A Google user,"December 28, 2017",5, Perfect for monitoring status of Azure services while on the road... Not as full featured as web based interface but handy and usefully none the less.
385,j3224 p,"December 31, 2017",5, Great for a mobile version. Nice to be able to turn IaaS on and of on the go.

391,Janaka Dissanayake,"December 14, 2017",4, Helps me monitor and occasionally manage my Azure infrastructure through mobile. I am really happy about the cloud PowerShell integration with the app. Hope the developers would add a mighty TAB button somewhere near the keyboard to make it more user friendly.
392,Jeff Nall,"December 14, 2017",4," Outstanding, except notifications arent working for me.  If you have things hosted in Azure, install this app now.  You need it."
393,Naveen Yadav,"December 4, 2017",5, Why not include a widget to shut down and start  a VM
394,Jaydeep Ranipa,"December 13, 2017",2, Not very Rich app. It's just a monitoring app. You cant create anything.

I would like to customize the metrics to show me info for the past hour (not just the past 24 hours or whatever the default is) also, like the website I can add additional measurements to the metrics such as CPU, memory, IO on top of DTUs."
401,Karay Akar,"November 3, 2017",5," Excellent app, that would be nice if we can see billing also."
402,Francis Cristallo,"November 21, 2017",2, So limited it's almost useless

404,Graham Harper,"October 20, 2017",4," Pleased to see some significant improvements. Looks to be very useful for monitoring the basic health of my Azure installations. Still has some interesting bugs and issues, but it's reassuring to see that the development team is responsive."

409,Joey Brakefield,"October 17, 2017",4, This app is great! All that's needed is the ability to switch tenants if the identity has access to multiple just like in the web portal.
410,A Google user,"October 15, 2017",2, The new version is crashing when you scroll fast in a huge list.

417,Srikanth Popuri,"October 5, 2017",2, Does not meet the expectations. Helpful only to deallocate vms and to start the existing vms. This App can't even create or delete resource groups. UI sometimes stuck and not user friendly.
418,Paul Keeney,"October 5, 2017",4, Great app to review resources but needs more control of resources built in

441,Paul Li,"June 21, 2017",1, Abusive permissions. Was working fine before now wants access to identity. Unacceptable
442,Mark Bell,"June 11, 2017",5, Love it. Love being able to check status of machines and drives on the go. Wish there was a quick view mode to get an overview of all resources' statuses without ha ing to click around.

446,alex lim,"May 26, 2017",5, Great work! App is fast and responsive. Has the common info in place which is all good. One enhancement would be to filter by powered on VMs. Or be able to see VM status from the list.
