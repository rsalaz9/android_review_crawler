0,Jade Guess,"January 7, 2020",5, I have never had issues with the app. They have even started including the seasonal grill items. Makes ordering from the grill easy.

7,David Moore,"August 13, 2015",4,"Great App! Only problem is that on Android it has a section for Special Instructions, but they don't get passed on to Deli.  I asked the Deli and they said that feature isn't supported and wasn't supposed to be in the app."
8,David Vijay R,"January 7, 2016",5,Excellent app Tried it for the first time today. Worked great. I see that there's no option to select oatmeal. It would be great if you guys can add it.
