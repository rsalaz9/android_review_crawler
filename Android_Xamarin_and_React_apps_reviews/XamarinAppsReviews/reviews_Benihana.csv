0,Patricia Sathre,"January 21, 2020",1, I went to the benihana's in Mall of America and I didn't get all I ordered on 1/13/20. I won't be returning to that place to soon.
1,Tiffany Harris,"October 25, 2019",5," I went to Benihana FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME last year!!!! I haven't been to a Japanese restaurant before, it was my Aunt's birthday. I ate sushi food and drink, and I loved it. Maybe I can come back EVEN MORE!!!!🔥💥🔥💞💞💞💞💞💞👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤗😊♥️♥️♥️♥️"
2,Brian Knopp,"April 19, 2019",1, bad rating due to restaurant giving me an incomplete order on my first visit. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER WHEN YOU PICK UP.
3,M Downey,"March 22, 2019",1, doesn't do anything!

in Alpharetta GA was unaware that this app was around and told me that my 
food could not be delivered. There needs to be communication to all the 
individual Benihana franchises so they know what is going on! Also you need 
to add the mustard sauce as an option to pick from as it is not there... it 
would be nice to have a note section to leave a personal note to the chief, 
such as temperature of meat or food allergy."
6,Christy Jones,"September 6, 2018",1, Doesn't even recognize the Benihana in Honolulu. Says it doesn't exist. That sucks.
7,Jeffrey Lobdell,"March 7, 2018",3," Would be nice if it had the options you have when ordering to go in person. Would also be nice if you could enter gift card information for payment, it would prevent me from having to actually wait there in person. Makes the app worthless."

They replaced the old giner containers with ones the size of thimbles to cut cost.  They charge $0.50 for just one in a to go order.  If  I sat in the restaurant I'd get all I want. The manager would rather fight over that then have happy customer.  Please avoid that location.

10,yamel hernandez,"February 11, 2018",2," Second time I ordered, portions were smaller and soup was missing plus no sauce added or forks. Not doing this again"
11,apes valdez,"January 31, 2018",1, For paying 50 dollars you would think they would deliver the complete meal you ordered. Ridiculous.
12,ramireztx361,"February 19, 2019",5, great
