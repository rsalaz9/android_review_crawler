And afterwards when I tend to choose paste, than its behave like paste special and the data arent in comformity with formats, fonts or colors. Sometimes its not possible even use the function an average and I suppose to calculate it mannually or set the formula like this = (A+B+C) /3. Whats that? Driving me crazy."

I love the Google software. For the most part, its seemless simplicity is an ingenious unique selling proposition. Google sheets for mobile, however, has an Achilles heel. When editing a textbox, if the user scrolls down, you lose all text. There is no way to retrieve it again. After having this happen to a paragraph I was trying to write for the seventh time, I gave up. Fix this and the review will be changed."
3,Max Howard-Evans,"April 29, 2020",1," Way too much space taken up by padding and unhideable top/bottom areas.

You should be able to hide all of this to maximise screen space, especially at resolutions of 1080p and upwards. It makes it so much harder to use well. Cell options are split randomly between lower row and top menu. Can't set formatting for columns if cells have no data, which again makes this less productive."

I waited patiently to be fixed with the new update as I've seen also many complaints from many users. But seems like it's being ignored by the authorized people of this app. I will reconsider to change my rating and review once this problem will be taken serious and fixed by the owners of this app."
5,Matt N,"April 3, 2020",1, The fact that the google play version doesn't mirror the functionality of the web version makes for a very frustrating user experience. They should be identical user experiences. At this time here is no reason to use this over the web version.

They should be identical user experiences. At this time here is no reason to use this over the web version. I would prefer to use the play version to at least feel like there's some advantage to owning a chromebook.

This is rediculous not being able to use a web version on phone. As soon as I download the app, I will uninstall it cause I don't use it"
7,Rogier Dikkes,"April 14, 2020",1," Getting forced to use the app instead of the webpage is a choice, but when you make this choice the app has to at least have all features the webpage has. In my case I cannot add any text in the cells. The keyboard never comes up. Poor experience for something that is so old and should be mature."
8,Kanji Watada,"April 15, 2020",1," It's very slow. Opening a sheet is painful. It's very slow. Making a sheet available offline doesn't appear to do anything. It's very slow. Sometimes it doesn't sync changes. It's very slow. Even with fast internet, 100+ Mbps, pages take a long time to load. It's very slow."

There's nothing wing with the internet connection as all other online apps are working just fine. Google sheets on my desktop PC is also working fine.

I don't have access to a computer 90% of the time I'm using sheets, if I had access to a computer I wouldn't be making or using spreadsheets from my phone. If the app ever gets better functionality, to the level of the web app, then I'd give it 5 stars. But until then, it's far too gutted and I'm tempted to pay for office 365."
12,Mike P,"April 7, 2020",2, This Android phone app is good for viewing your sheets from Google Drive and that's it. It's clunky and terrible to use from your phone. I can't count the number of times I've tried to make a simple edit on my phone only to thrown it down in frustration and pull my laptop out.
13,WR II,"March 1, 2020",4," Works great and regularly receives updates. However, I think something is wrong with the latest update concerning downloading a sheet and sending one.

It seems to corrupt and wont open and also tells me that there's an incomplete upload but my internet connection is good. Please fix and I will change this to 5 stars."
14,Mayank Pratap Singh,"March 15, 2020",1," I am working on a shared file. Since past 2 days whenever i try to open it through the app, i keep getting a weird error saying 'Unable to open document. Check your internet connection, then try again."" My internet is working perfectly. At least give a proper error so that i can fix it."

It has also the option of basic excel file editing, so one can do minor editing. However if you need to do some serious excel work, you should check other applications. Otherwise this application is good enough for checking excel or spreadsheet file."
16,John Macdonald,"March 14, 2020",2," Reasonable app. BUT, the Sheets file is not saved as an Excel compatible spreadsheet (no file extension). My fault for assuming it was. It needs to be, and can be exported as another file type. Apparently the format is TSV, tab separated values. Not even CSV. Painful. At least the support is good."
17,Cassey Nicole,"February 21, 2020",2," Good app, but I just opened it up to update my budget that I have on there, and it refreshed and showed me what my budget looked like, like 3 or 4 weeks ago. All the work I've put into it since, gone. Really wish this would get fixed, as this isn't the first time of this happening to me."
18,Eric Tam,"March 14, 2020",1," Will not open Sheet using the Google Sheets app. Keep getting a ""Unable to Open the Document""... ""Check your internet connection, then try again."" But I am connected to the Internet, and the Sheet works fine on my laptop, and desktop PC. Extremely frustrating."
19,Nick Lott,"April 18, 2020",3," Fine but it does not allow you to open downloaded files (""This file is not available offline"" etc) which seems like a major bug for a mobile phone app because presumably most people aren't actually creating complex spreadsheets on phone, only viewing them."
20,Aloysius,"March 3, 2020",1," I use google sheets quite often to keep track of the current events that my friends and family shares and i have dark mode enabled, but few days later, dark mode was somehow disabled and effects were lost on google sheets but other apps are fine, google sheets should have supported darkmode but it j...Full ReviewI use google sheets quite often to keep track of the current events that my friends and family shares and i have dark mode enabled, but few days later, dark mode was somehow disabled and effects were lost on google sheets but other apps are fine, google sheets should have supported darkmode but it just lost effects of it somehow, even other google services except for gmail, google play store and google chrome."

The chrome based browser app has always been better and now I can't get that to launch with this horrible android app installed. I was hoping that 2 years after adding android to chrome you would see android apps with better desktop capability and only the opposite has occured (shoving poor, touch-friendly, feature-poor android apps on chromeOS)."
22,Nova Kat,"March 4, 2020",3," Works pretty good but one of the biggest flaws with this app is that it does not allow you to adjust the headers and footers, and so far from my testing it removes any header and footer info already set otherwise I'd probably give it 5 stars but to me this is a large flaw in the app."

JUST please keep improving 💕!!! Oh👨💦please make image/drawing stick to cell(s) and maybe some stickers should be available...thanks! Phone view would be better if the upper horizontal ABC and left vertical 123(cell addresses) will be slimmer to give more space on the contents😅.
24,Saleh Aweek,"April 16, 2020",4, There some important features missing such as linked cells(there are workarounds) the ability to lock adding new tabs for some users and other stuff but there are lots of great points that are no where else! Great app for sure

Which is very annoying to me to change again in numerical keyboard.. Please solve this issue.."
26,The lesser lights,"April 12, 2020",3," Great app for excel spreadsheets, to view and edit them. Sadly, it does not stay open for long in the background so you have to keep re opening it. Great tool for business owners."
27,Majd Haj,"April 11, 2020",1," All in all it's pretty decent, but I can't insert a line break inside a cell in a convenient manner, which is surprisingly absurd for an app like this"
28,Dave Lucero,"April 26, 2020",5, I love the layout of the spreadsheets and Google Sheets is user friendly.
29,Christopher Neville,"March 3, 2020",4," Overall, I really like the app. However, over the past several weeks have noticed that it crashes very often which has made it unusable. I am disappointed about that, but trust that the issues will be resolved soon."
30,Jim Boling,"February 20, 2020",5," What's the deal with the constant ""All x files are now available offline"" message? It sits there looping that message. Last time I restarted my phone and it quit for a while. Now it is at it again."
31,Блэгъожъ Джанэр,"April 30, 2020",5, I love this app. But why do you still have old Turkish currency (YTL) on app? There is no such mistake on web app. Please consider this in your update.
32,Chris Bolton,"April 29, 2020",5," Love this little spreadsheet prog, it does all I need - on my phone!"
33,Victoria McKoy Griffin,"February 21, 2020",2, This app still needs the ability to create Named Ranges in the app and to move tabs much more easily. And something is NOT right with the paste function. A regular copy/paste of a formula should not paste only the values.
34,Jennifer Ifeyinwa Mordi,"March 17, 2020",1," Everyone is complaining about the same issue but nothing has been done about it, keeps popping up error messages when trying to open doc. Saving error check internet connection and there's nothing wrong with the connection"
35,Mr B-61,"April 6, 2020",2, After last update I'm unable to modify any file. Can view but that is all. Update. Its happening again. Same problem.
36,Evangelist Pulipaka,"March 19, 2020",1," Worst app Hours of work just gone in a second Don't keep your important data in this, you'll face problem for sure. One fine morning when you wake up and see that all your data is missing all of sudden No help from Google support Gonna uninstall now"
37,Avinash Gautam,"April 20, 2020",5, Google as usual comes up with such a subtle and smooth solution to most of such issues that it is just not possible to praise it at that level.
38,Hamza Sheikh,"April 18, 2020",5, Most user friendly application which allows me to use my data from anywhere allows you to see sheets offline as well if you don't have wifi or data.. Work can be done from anywhere..
39,Antoine Raffoul,"April 14, 2020",4," Good but can be improved by adding few functions concerning formatting and making it easy to export spreadsheets... All in all, good instrument for light jobs...AR... 👍"
40,Yaseen Abdul Razzaq,"April 17, 2020",4, This app should work it's way for a replacement of Microsoft excel on pc and for that it still has a long way to go
41,heena attar,"April 26, 2020",5, Google Sheets are Far better than so called MS Excel. You can also easily do edits in your mobile. Atleast for me this is a life saver in this lockdown time.
42,Daryl Ng,"April 5, 2020",1," ""Network error occurred"" for days whenever i need to access the sheet. Everyone else can access it but me, and my internet services and wifi are working well"
43,0,"April 11, 2020",1," [Better alternative: Excel] Too many desktop features missing such as sorting A-Z, colours are different. Does not sum or automatically valculate numbers or create pivot tables. Very clunky to use despite Samsung stylus with hover and click feature."
44,Jay Kalio,"February 24, 2020",4," Luv this app!! Works perfectly on all my mobile devices. Updating docs while on the go via my Pixel 2 and then continued were I left off with my Samsung Tab A or laptop. Thanks and please, keep improving it :)"
45,art4lumley,"March 24, 2020",1, It logged me out and I can't log back in to get the information that I have on this app.. there is no customer support line to help with the issues.. so I'm locked out and stuck with all my information inside there that I need..
46,Ms. Fixit,"April 5, 2020",5," Thank you so much for restoring functionality. This is my favorite app for accounting, Great continued improvements. Thank you!!!"
47,David Boyd,"April 9, 2020",4, Really useful but seems to get stick making sheets available offline. Notification is visible for hours sometimes despite being on good wifi and only way to get rid of it is to Force Stop the app
48,Maddineni Venkat,"April 14, 2020",1, It showing google spreadsheets stops working...it shows corrupted
49,Deepan Atr,"March 8, 2020",1," Google sheets now not get opening throws error like A network error has occured.Please make sure that you are connected to the Internet. But im able to complaint this via my Internet, when try to open Sheets but shows network connection error."
50,Pricila Motha,"April 25, 2020",3," I can't work on my android , why won't this page open?"
51,Oron Feinerman,"April 12, 2020",1," Pretty much useless. No cut/copy/paste for cells, data entry is unintuitive, overall lacking in functionality compared to desktop web version."

54,Bharat Rajpurohit,"February 27, 2020",5," Hey , Google sheet for mobile , this app is very nice but in Google Excel sheet I can't see after 851 rows. for the next row like after 851+ Rows it's now showing in this app so if it possible please give us new update for same."
55,Chandan Kumar Pandey,"April 13, 2020",1, Verrry baad..It's made for mobile but it's of no use i am not able to edit a cell just because it has more than 1 line in it. I am not able to take my cursor there. It again come back to station of word.
56,Anitha Ashok,"April 18, 2020",1, Unable to install in my android mobile phone. It tries to unzip a file but the process eventually fails.
57,John Montana,"March 11, 2020",2, Copy and paste does not preserve formulas. Makes it very difficult to edit or create new spreadsheets. Works well for viewing existing spreadsheets.
58,Jacob Potyraj,"March 26, 2020",1, Filters just don't work. Only thing that worked was sorting from a->z or z->a and then there was no way to return it to the original configuration. Legs and slow. Terrible to work on.
59,Dan Koen,"April 9, 2020",4," I'm so glad I purchased OfficeSuite Pro/PDF Extra/PhotoSuite works seamlessly with Microsoft Office an Google Docs/Drive/Photos, Not sure if it's compatible with Sheets yet."
60,Lori Bean,"March 16, 2020",3, I use Google sheets online and on the app. But for some reason I can't figure out how to enter text (words) on the app. No problem online.
61,Elenin meija,"April 10, 2020",1, This is the worst the more you use it the worse its gets and it keeps glitching a lot. I would not recommend at all. Its horrible
62,Daniel B,"April 18, 2020",5, For a mobile app they have managed to cram a lot of features in and make it a desktop-like experience. Very good!
63,Vishwanath Pandey,"February 23, 2020",4, Very useful app in all respect. It's a must for every senseful user for maintaining almost all sorts of records.One should use it frequently without any hesitation.
64,SUBRATA SARKAR,"February 23, 2020",5, It's very helpful for daily use. But some of the questions still unknown to me viz how to change size of cell & row & save the file. Thank you. Waiting for your answer.
65,Yingjie Li,"March 29, 2020",1, Google sheets is probably the worst google app apart from maybe Google Meet. It is so hard to use and always freezes. I recommend you not get this app and try Microsoft Excel instead.
66,Jacob Mowrey,"April 8, 2020",1, All I know about this application is that it was used not very long ago to copy all my contacts and export out of my phone and Google account all together
67,rohit deshmukh,"February 27, 2020",3, Google sheets does not support a password protected file. It does not open synced Microsoft Excel password protected file which makes it not so user friendly. Google try to fix this issue.
68,David Simon,"February 29, 2020",2, Can't use alt+enter on Microsoft foldable Bluetooth keyboard to make a new line in a cell. I had to switch to Microsoft Excel to have that work properly.

73,Fahim Ferdous,"March 21, 2020",3, Sometime it crashes disgustingly while including pictures or open a heavy file to attach photo.... It should be solved...🤗 But still a good app to record your data through Google Drive & Gmail😊 It helps me a lot😌
74,jaimin rupani,"April 4, 2020",3, Google sheet is not allowing to open password protected excel files which is very strange. Apart from that useful application.

76,Mohan Nair,"March 6, 2020",5," Nice app. Only you should learn first to use as this is not as simple as other app, especially formulas. Once learnt, it is very much useful...i enjoyed it...excellent"
77,tommm,"March 12, 2020",4," Works great. Although i hope this could be something like the ""ported"" desktop version instead of just a more simplified mobile version."
78,Jobin Agnel,"March 30, 2020",4," Unable to find Pivot table. Thanx google to make an amazing app like this. This app is perfrct for all requirements, but, I didnt find an option to do pivot table for my data.. if there is an option, pleasse help"

83,bessie freelancen,"March 26, 2020",3," The apps offered by Google no longer optimized on my device are being disabled. Why the change? Beats me! That being said, I will no longer sacrifice my battery/device health for anyone's benefit but my own."
84,Derek A,"February 29, 2020",1, How come it's still so buggy? Copy & paste on a single cell really messes up the whole sheet! Unusable. No stars for this app...
85,Jenevive Sapungay,"April 24, 2020",3, I've been trying to add a file to my homescreen. Tried it several times but it didn't work. Unsure if it's a bug on my phone or on the app itself.

91,sooraj kdas,"February 28, 2020",4," Very good app. Easy to use. But Google sheets consider numbers with coma as a word. Like 1,23,456 . 23,34,456"

93,Jinggo Improso,"March 4, 2020",1, is it just me or it really is impossible to delete individual cells in this app? You can only delete rows or columns but NOT CELLS!

243,Nepeta Leijon,"February 3, 2020",2," Colour choices are extremely limited. You can't add custom colours, and the app only shows 10 of the custom colors in your spreadsheet. It is impossible to even input a specific hex code with the app."
244,Kseniya G.,"February 6, 2020",2," What does ""bug fixes and performance improvements"" mean? Every update has that description. So many apps get worse with updates, so I would like to know what has changed in the latest version, and not just get a blah blah blah description ."

262,Rick Traveler Smith,"December 2, 2019",1, What's the point of clicking Make Available Offline if you still need a network to open the files? That is highly contradictory and misleading.

263,Abhinav Satpathi,"January 14, 2020",5," Google sheets very helpful to create some notes, letters, applications, circulars & etc. Most important thing in this app features like internet to connected so it's through another mobile or laptop to login your email id and show your documents in laptop.

269,Jordan Harris,"December 10, 2019",4, Really enjoy this app. User friendly. Able to share with others to make changes to important spreads. Question though. Is there ever going to be a widget to view an already existing sheet on your phone's homepage without having to go into the app itself?
270,Atharva Deolalikar,"December 13, 2019",1," Absolutely disappointed First of all, excel file is directly opened by default excel handler (google sheets).

286,Praveen Sappali,"January 5, 2020",1, Too many bugs. Gets crashed and auto closed after small amount of data. Done too many unistallations and reinstall. Cleared cache. Nothing works. It's only for user's with low data management.
287,Josh Vogler,"January 25, 2020",1," Decided to go full-time with Google sheets. Since last update, literally nothing works. Continually says network error no matter what. This happens with all the time with Google apps, they just push broken updates."

968,April Barlow,"May 30, 2019",5, I love this app. The design is so simple to use. It's easy to edit and change sheets. One thing I hope they add is the ability to size cells through pixel number so I can make them all nice and even.

She was using Excel, but I told her, ""We need to get you into the Sheets"". She misinterpreted what I meant by that and we ended up multiplying like rabbits with calculators on my uncle's tie-dye futon.
