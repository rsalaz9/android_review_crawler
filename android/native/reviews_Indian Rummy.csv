0,Ravivarma G,"April 11, 2020",5," First thing I love here, no need to register, doesn't need any information about us. We can join with our friends by using random code. That's I love lot. Simple and neat. Some suggestions: chat environment may be added in future. Create point table. Increase multiplayer. Draw options may be added."
1,santosh mule,"April 18, 2020",5, Superb game but sometimes there comes an network issue in both the mobiles which we want to play ......but the app is superb and functions are also too good ..those who are installing this app no need to worry ....this app have safety too.but plzzzz check what's the network problem..
2,Sundararaman Gopalan,"April 25, 2020",5," Very nice game to play...very well suited for playing with friends without any online payment...no chip...no payment required. you can play with your family and friends. Very nice. If you can add 6 players, it would be great."
