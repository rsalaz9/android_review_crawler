I love that the canvas is boundless, or if I set an art board size, I can draw past the edge. I like setting ""finger action"" to ""nudge"". Now I can quickly draw with the stylus and immediately make an adjustment with my finger, without having to select a different tool. I'm impressed!"

That means storyboards, wireframe sketches, etc. The two killer features that I found in another app were an infinite canvas and the ability to export clean scalable visuals. I haven't found that again anywhere else until I found this app. That other app was quite buggy and slow, but this operates very smoothly and with added features that make creating storyboards much more convenient. I only just installed it today, and already upgraded, but I'm excited to see how this improves my daily experience."
2,nick founride,"April 26, 2020",5, This is one of the best drawing app out there the only problem is that it is limited for Windows users. I would without a doubt pay for a full version (even if it was a bit more expensive no subscription). I hope that they bring all of the IOS features to this platform.

Sketch with pencil, switch to pen, and it automatically draws on top. The fill and airbrush tools fall in-between. Sure, you can manually use any tool on any layer, or change layer order, but for working up concepts quickly, the automatic setting is a dream. The fast select/dupe/scale/rotate is a major help for working up variations. Great application!"

Adjust line width, opacity or something else, close the menu and then try rotating the circle tool selection. 100/100 times instead of rotating the tools I will instantly start changing value of whatever setting you last changed. And there's no way to undo it, you have to guess what the value was that you changed..."

There are a few issues that plague this app. One of them is that while drawing, menus keep popping up causing me to accidentally select and change settings. While trying to change pen settings, such as the opacity, the size of the pen will be changed, this of course is very frustrating. Lastly, the Fill tool is not a good replacement for a bucket tool."
6,sam a,"April 24, 2020",3, It's ok with a few one interesting features. But expensive. Everyone hates subscription plans on play store including me. I'd rather have a one time fee that gives me access to all features including brushes. Autodesk and adobe are pretty good substitute.
7,Kate Hudson,"March 15, 2020",5," Love this app. I use it for calligraphy and lettering. It's easy to use, and the line smoothing and ability to nudge or drag existing lines is great.

Like another reviewer, I find occasionally that leaning the side of my hand on the tablet inadvertently does some other action. I'd like to see the same features as on iOS, so good to see that is in development. I'd really like a pen that emulates brush lettering, with thin upstrokes and thick down strokes. Any chance of developing one please?"

Also the ability to dock the tools to either sides of the app. But above all please give us a better way of getting straight lines. That should have been added to the app from the beginning.

As a marketeer I communicate visually and Concepts has become my go to tool for taking meeting notes, (so excited by prospect of PDF import and would love a text tool), kicking up diagrams and designs. I've found the colour picker super cool but for brand guidelines would like the ability to add specific colours and have a quick way to pick them from some type of Swatch. Overall a great tool that I'd recommend"

11,Areeba Yaqoob,"April 15, 2020",1," This app is crashing all time whenever I use to draw something it never shows me what I am drawing and when I press the back button, the screen turns black. I can't draw a single line🤨"

13,Abigail De Vera,"April 14, 2020",3," Covers the basics, but I wish the iOS features were also here like creating basic shapes. This app is better in iOS and that's unfortunate for a such a capable app. Will those features be in Android? We'll never know."
14,Reonia Mathew,"April 14, 2020",5, It's a really really nice app I've been looking for one like this for so long!! I recently lost my stylus but even just using this on my phone with my fingers is just great. I use it for everything now.
15,Breanne Aullman,"April 23, 2020",4," I really love this app, but do wish it had a few more features (more brushes, line/shape tools, fill tool). But i am really enjoying it."
16,Checkie Dator,"March 27, 2020",4," This app is really good for drawing! I really enjoy making art. But the only reason why I rate this a 4 is because everytime I save an art project, the drawing becomes sideways and I can't save the drawing with a straight format."
17,gokul gupta,"February 19, 2020",5," great for architects,, when are you going to add the precision and scalling features in the android version (they are there in the ios version)? it's a great app for android one of the only good one out there. but the android app is way behind the apple version ."
18,Alex Alvarado,"April 12, 2020",5," Definetely the best drawing app for my Pixel Book. Given Chrome OS's curren't situation, Concepts is the app that runs the best compared to any other app and provides the most features."
19,Jeff Dragonette,"March 24, 2020",4, So far so good 👌 however I do wish purchases were cross platform IE I purchased the essentials upgrade for $9.99 through the Google play store for my Galaxy note 10+ and if I want that same upgrade for my laptop to use it in conjunction with my huion tablet i will have to purchase it again 😡.
20,Haydn Gomez,"April 21, 2020",4, The best design app I have found for drawing directly on a tablet due to nib and pressure accuracy with an S-pen. Simple but effective tool's where other apps feel ' full-featured' but imprecise.
21,Steve Layton,"March 10, 2020",4, Lots of potential. I'd like to see a better cost structure as a casual user who still enjoys flexibility of brushes. It's almost feature rich enough to use over autodesk sketchbook .
22,Dan Noyb,"March 2, 2020",2, Lots of help on how to draw but could find nothing about how to use the app. Gave up taping things on the screen trying to get past the select pen size wheel in the upper left corner. 😔
23,ElectricSpaghetti,"March 26, 2020",5, I love the infinite stretching canvas so much! I'm glad because usually my concepts are too big or i want to add more so this is perfect! Considering premium already and I only downloaded this app like a moment ago!
24,Alfred Arreguin,"April 25, 2020",4, Many great things to say about this app. Just know for now if you want a sketch app this is best so far. And they are getting better.
25,geobese,"April 7, 2020",4," love using this on my PC but on the phone app, there is no sign in option so i can't sync my drawings to look at them in my phone :-("
26,Tegan Norris,"March 18, 2020",5, I love this app it is simple to use and no complicated sign in just put your email in and draw also great for doing homework it has gridded pages to do scratch work on I've had great experiences with this app and I hope that this review will help
27,Chole Mota,"March 16, 2020",2, I kinda got to fidget around but after 3 minutes it didn't work anymore it said everything was on purchase but the colors and organization was fine just needs to improve..
28,TaraBama Tv,"April 9, 2020",2, Its a good app but sometimes it wouldnt let me draw and kept saying go pro over and over so i uninstaled it and tried again and it still didnt work
29,Ainu Faisal,"April 1, 2020",1," I cant draw anything, the line doesn't appear until i change the canvas position 😂 Update 1: no option for that 🙈"
30,LGBT IDDQD,"April 27, 2020",4, It would be the perfect app with Spen support (button for erasing a stroke or others) and rulers/solid shapes.
31,Arts And Creatives Ltd,"February 21, 2020",5," I Love it, as sketching is what I do, this apps is AMAZING for artist, architects, design etc."
32,Sk Lor,"April 9, 2020",4," Everything are fine, except no sinple select function for free version."

46,Misha Ponomarenko,"February 12, 2020",5," Love the app so far. Use Pro version. Of course, Apple version is more advanced and has more cool features, and this one still has long way to go but so far I'm happy with it and anxiously wait for new cool features. This app motivates me to sketch more."

Another thing, is that it feels like a finished art program, and the eraser is broken. Thank you, and sorry I couldn't fit more in."

That's the price you should pay for a one time full access, not a month. I'd rather have ads for this price. I mean, you don't even offer a trial to see if the full features are worth it. You can't even move anything"

Using for D&D map making where a grid and rustic map background colour are a boon. Missing the 'straight edge' aspects of Autodesk but with the selector tool where you can pretty much redo your line in every way it helps with the natural 'hand drawn' finish of a great map/layout. Still a noob with this app and would like (if not there) a way to copy/paste or transfer between layers as i'm alway forgetting to switch and have to delete/redo on the correct layer (EDIT found it, it's in the import image menu - Doh). Would like to see atmo brushes for hatching, rubble general stuff but realise this is far to specific to fantasy map or such like use. Love the infinite canvas, but would like a print view (not restricted) to show how it will look when printed to A4, A3 etc just for scale. All in all i cannot complain and am loving this app more each time I use it. Not a fan of subscriptions as i'm a sketch when you have time person so will never subscribe, having said that you get what you need (assumed as not really specified what more you get) with the paid version. Would like to see cloud save for cross platform/devise use but not a must as only have one pen related device! Good work guys!"

One I use it on a Samsung tab S 4 and it works great for the most part however for some reason the slice tool lags in place behind my pen almost every time i use it. Two my brother has an Ipad pro and it seems to have more features, some of which i was surprised where missing on the android version and was (if im being honest) not surprised where on his Ipad. On a rather good note i switched to this app from what i was using because it allows me to import pictures alter them then re-upload them to Google drive(with the essentials pack) which i love and is great, i love the tool wheel and how i lets me set the tools i use the most, i freaking love the color wheel and could just play with it for hours, although it took be awhile to find a shade of red because it looked different on the color when than when i drew with it. One and Two are my only major gripes, but i really do like this software and will bump up my rating when one of those two get patched."

I'm using both for some reasons and paid exact amount for the same PRO features on both versions, but it's shame that android one's PRO feature has nothing at all: I can't control texture scale or brush/tools feature alike ipad ones.

Really reignited my love of drawing. I have most of the one time paid components on both my Android devices and my Surface Go. Still five stars but I do wish the Android/Windows versions matched up with the Apple iOS version a bit more. I keep seeing hundreds of tutorials for the ipad that don't quite fit with the features of the Android/Windows versions. I especially want to try out the water color paint mixing option that seem to be available on iOS. Hopefully soon!

There's no way to rename the current artwork. Exported svg doesn't keep the variable line width when importing to Illustrator. No symmetry tools, only reflecting existing traits. Compared to Infinite Painter (which is cheaper), it lacks many features. Hopefully they will make this app at least as good as their iOS one."

74,Nucleus Rhyme,"December 7, 2019",2," An okay drawing app pushing to sell the user premium features. But app of the year 2019? Not really. It is in no way distinguishable from 20 other drawing apps, all with their own small plus and minuses. And no, it won't make your mid-range phone into an iPad with its average optimizations."
75,Derek Troyer,"December 30, 2019",2," This app could be great for design/ drawing, but everything I tried to do required purchasing the paid version. Very little is available with the free version. Using it never became intuitive to me. Too bad."

77,Veena Prasad,"November 13, 2019",4," The app would've been perfect if there were more brushes. It has unlimited canvas space, color pallette recommendation, great stabilizer, the wheel, quality, smooth design. Everything is great. But, without much brushes, it'll stay a basic app. Sad."
78,Anna Drake,"December 14, 2019",4, It's great! I feel comfortable with it! You can zoom as much as you like there are no limits! I like this app but there are lack of tools and brushes so I won't give the last star.

I do some inking of my pencil drawings, I also need to finalize my sketches with Inkscape. Developers answered my question about the app behavior in exporting SVG, see below. It suits perfectly my needs (but artists who works with stylus pressure and dynamic brushes should be aware that it will not be retained in the SVG). The app focus on freehand sketching, so no bezier curve tool and precise node/path edition. But excellent in what it does and the best current option I found on Android to do vectorial drawing with a pleasant drawing experience. Looking forward to the app evolution !"
