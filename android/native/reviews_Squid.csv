I use squid for school and all features I need is there. From drawing shapes to make table and easy way to add photos, I think upgrading to premium is a must. But the only thing that I think needs to be upgraded is the way to scroll the page is slow I don't know it's repairable or not but I dont like the way it comes out as boxy first then it becomes normal. But overall the apps is good"
1,Gergely Ap√°thy,"April 24, 2020",4," squid is the best option we have, period.

But in some cases, it could be su much better. -utilise the s-pen as best as possible (other optimalization stuff) -let us have favourite pens and colours so we can browse trough them with the s-pen button for a much quicker switch -it sometimes feels a bit off, Samsung notes gives a much better writing experience for me, idk how to put this in useful terms -overall redesign with night mode? (this just my opinion, far from a must do)"
2,Ridderz 333,"April 23, 2020",5," Love this app! Been using it for revision notes at university.

I think it has good potential. To be quite honest, the design and look of the app feels kinda old and really clunky. I feel like the app just looks kinda blah. But in top of that there's a lot of functionality, just in wrong places. You provide extremely niche templates and ruling. But you only provide one pen and highlighter! Very frustrating, add in some sort of calligraphy pen or something flourishy. Something to get people creative."
4,Sandy Bryant,"April 21, 2020",5," The best I've used for importing PDFs which you want to annotate. Fully utilizes the Google Stylus variable pressure/line thickness function.

I often use Squid to make PDF presentations, and my slide advancer (Kensington with USB) does not advance ""slides."" I have to press the page advance <> icons manually. Would really appreciate the ability to fully-present without having to go to the screen to go to the next slide."

What i love most is the infinity board which allows me to just keep on drawing and brainstorm + zoom in with 2 fingers. Im on the paid version. What i would suggest to add is more friendly ways to access the tools. Its ok, but can be improved. Tqs!"
6,Yusuf Abu Shamsi,"April 24, 2020",3, I like this app. Probably the best for android hence I paid for the subscription. But not having sync to Google drive or One drive is one of it downfall. At least that is the most common cloud. The amount of pen type can also be improved.
7,Matthew Wilson,"April 19, 2020",4," The one thing I would like to see improvement in is the shape tool. The circle tool makes the circle in a box, and doesn't track right. If it was a select the center, drag to edge thing, it'd be more accurate. Also, the snap to a shape feature on Notability is super nice."
8,Sathappan Somasundaram,"April 24, 2020",5, One of the best noyebook apps i have used. Tons of different options to choose from. I really liked being able to choose my paper size and type.
9,Quang Nguyen,"April 22, 2020",3," Good note taking app, but few modern utilities. Need a lot of quality of life additions."
10,Tasnad Kernetzky,"April 24, 2020",5," Perfect app. Pricing is quite high though, if you opt for the subscription way."

I am using it on a Pixel Slate tablet and it is very convenient that I can write notes and edit PDF files. I would have given it 5 stars but the integration with Dropbox is a bit clunky. I cannot share my notes in the Dropox and Drive folders I share with my students.
13,Some Man,"April 23, 2020",5, Two requests: 1. Add a dotted line pen. 2. I'd like a black background option. Thanks!
14,Jeff C,"April 26, 2020",5," The best app for drawing, writing, note taking , etc. I wish Squid was available for iOS. I would pay big money for it."

The palm rejection is way ahead of other apps, even Google's own Google Keep, which is shocking to me. What would really help it to pull ahead is a dark theme and a redesigned interface that makes quicker access to all the tools."
16,Hibist Siyoum,"April 2, 2020",3," Honestly I really like it, it is better than a lot of the options out there.

The only two problems I have with it is that I have to zoom in to max to write with the stylus I have (adonit snap) other wise it there are gaps. Also the fact that importing PDF isn't free bummer but it's okay. But writing experience on a PNG is kind of really sad. Over all just writing notes I really like it."
17,Amy Kim,"April 17, 2020",5, Love this app. Works great with my stylus and has been great at keeping my life organized. Thank you!!!

Being able to save preset pen sizes and colours would be fantastic. An option to set default conditions for read-only like ""fit width"" or double tap to fit width, would be very useful when going back over notes and switching between writing and reading notes in different view ""modes"". Finally, in read-only, being able to tap RHS of screen to go to next page and LHS to go back would be gr8."

20,Vanessa Pena,"April 23, 2020",5," My favorite! I use this more than Microsoft. I recommend it to all my family, friend, & coworkers."

One, there isn't an option to sync to onedrive or googledrive. Huge issue for me, considering I really wanted a way to store all my notes in college. Two, I hate the organization of this app. I can't make folders or subfolders or color coding. Three, I hate the fact that I can't type notes as well. Sometimes I want to handwrite but other times I don't. I hope they update soon."

Backing up and restoring from cloud services does work, however it is much more complicated than some thing like one-note. This makes using Squid on multiple devices a hassle. Squid makes up for this by being the smoothest, most responsive note-taker I've used on any device! One-note for android is glitchy and all the others are slow or feature-poor. PDFs are a Breeze to write over too, great for homework!"

27,R K,"April 6, 2020",4," The app is great but it has a few cons. I'd like to see some updates and more features considering the fact you pay a montly fee for the premium version. I'd recommend adding more text editting tools (e.g. bold, underline text) and an option for organising notebooks in different subcategories."

Not being able to rotate a page or doc really sucks. I went around this by locking my laptop orientation while in tablet mode. A built in doc rotation would be really useful instead of having to crop something then rotating it because i want the whole thing rotated. PLEASE ADD A DARK MODE PLEASE.

Because these two functions make GoodNotes 5 still be the best PDF annotating app ever. Furthermore, the highlighter should make words and sentences look clearer, not fade. Thus, the highlighter should not overlay on the texts. Is this a glitch? Or just something the developers haven't realise it. Regards."

I really suffered from a lag between touching the screen and an actual response, it made handwriting almost impossible. But in Squid such a lag is not noticeable, I just set a scale to 1000% and used my laptop as a paper notepad, loosing only a small amount of speed (but I guess it's due to my laptop and a pen itself, but not the software) I really like this app and appreciate your work, thank you guys P. S. I miss a calender option"
37,Atom's Sister,"April 20, 2020",5," I love this app, If Develop can upload file on cloud.I think for the Best. Thank you!!"
38,Charlie Lindler,"April 20, 2020",4, Great writing app. Would love to see some support for UML but love this app.
39,Elliot Jenner,"March 24, 2020",1," Presentation mode is mentioned everywhere in the help but not how to actually turn it on or use it. I have looked everywhere and I cannot find anything other than settings for it, which are just for enabling and automatically starting. I have no idea how to actually use it. Here is not a link."
40,yap yu hang,"April 17, 2020",5," This app is pretty nice. Somehow, scrolling seem a bit laggy and also lack some feature like copy picture from another app and paste directly into the page.

While writing with the pen, sometimes the it just stops writing and then the writting that I did 5 seconds ago appears. If not it just leaves a dotted mark sometime rather than writing what I want it to write. A fix would be helpful given that I'm paid for the premium features."
42,Shohrat Shankar,"April 15, 2020",5, It's a good app. The writing is smooth and fluid using my Stylus on Chromebook Pro. The best part is the ability to import PDF and annotate it. Have been using this for a few years now and very happy.
43,mike crawford,"April 7, 2020",3," good but not great, It is lacking syncing across devices and I have had to reinstall it a couple time and lost all the past files I had created. The ability to use my S-Pen to write is very nice and it is very intuitive to use."
44,Bernard Brincat,"March 20, 2020",4, What Squid does it does really well. There are a few badly-needed tweaks which can make this program really great. One thing I miss is having a few pen presets rather having to adjust with sliders. The developer seems to be actively welcoming suggestions so I'm keeping fingers crossed.
45,SHOURYA JAIN,"April 24, 2020",3, allow more fluent hand writting and add an option to quickly the matter over the screen.

47,Kevin Nault,"March 16, 2020",4," An all-around great annotation program. I use this program to take preparatory and mid-hearing notes when I'm in court, and to annotate PDFs when I review documents. I used to use Inkredible (from memory), but Squid works infinitely more smoothly with my HP Chromebook X2."
48,Robin Bell,"April 7, 2020",5," great app for taking notes. Well worth paying the subscription to import and annotate PDFs. I only wish I could search note titles, now that I'm using it more and have lots of notes."
49,Antonio Ore≈°koviƒá,"April 12, 2020",5, Simple but powerful tool for making all the meeting notes and plans forward. Paid version is definitely worth of money. Stylus response is also very good. Recommend everyone who keeps daily notes.
50,Fawaz A,"April 22, 2020",5," Exellent app, i recommend only to link it with an account so you can see same notes in all of your devices."
51,Jeffrey Goh,"April 25, 2020",3," Just still need some minor enhancement, when attach PDF, still can't rotate after insert, the rest working fine. I love this app. Would like to know when Squid can solve this issue?"
52,blauer wurm,"April 15, 2020",3," It's just another note app. I would have given it a higher rating if there was an option for a one time purchase, but it's subscription based. There needs to be folder within folder option."
53,An√© de Kock,"March 5, 2020",5," This app has been such a help with university work. It allows me to have all of my notes, summaries and more with me wherever I go. It's super functional with the ability to import .pdf files and insert photos. One of the best investments I've made so far in regards to my studies."
54,Stefano Carn√†,"April 13, 2020",4," Very useful app, but the lack of some specific features makes it not completed yet. Anyway, in my opinion, it's one of the best app to make notes using the stylus."
55,Carson Osmond,"March 29, 2020",5," Love this app. I've used it around a year for school. I'd have no problem recommending the subscription version of this app. The extra features are well worth the cost, in my opinion."
56,Mohamad Faizul Yahya,"April 15, 2020",5, Squid is very reliable program and I use it a lot for my hall lecture . The software is stable and runs very fluid on my samsung 2016 tab A. Keep up the good work guys. I have used it since 2014.
57,Eddie Murphy,"April 4, 2020",2, Looks like a great app to start. The feature that it is missing most is palm rejection. Completely unusable without it. Surely this module could be bought in from someone!!
58,Joseph McLean,"April 10, 2020",5," Perfect for math distance learning. I can emulate my document camera function , record my lesson using Screencastify, and export a PDF of my notes so my students can access them. Perfect for my needs."
59,Rachel Ang,"April 17, 2020",4," The best note taking app I've used so far, over both android and apple! Some features on my wishlist for this app though are for further integration with education apps like google classroom, and of course mass import and export of pdf please!"
60,Nath√°lia C.,"April 1, 2020",4, I'd give it five stars if it had the option of rotating things like text and selected marks. It's a important feature that stops me from loving this app.
61,Alex Pinnock,"March 1, 2020",5," As an investigator, this app changes everything! I can take handwritten notes, add a photograph, save it all to a PDF and forward it to my client instantly. Perfect for recording statements, collecting evidence and organising thoughts."
62,fischeai,"April 7, 2020",4, Great for note taking and marking up PDFs. Wish there was more seamless integration with Google Drive and an option to create custom templates.
63,Paul Hampshire,"April 6, 2020",4," Great app but it would be easier to use if there was an online manual, taking clips does not seem to work for me so I have to use a snipping tool."
64,Esther Friedman,"March 5, 2020",3," It is useful in creating PDFs and sharing. It is not very efficiant to work with the editing tools, adjusting size or changing pages order. But it still allowes to work on PDFs where some other apps don't."
65,Mohammed Alkulaib,"March 11, 2020",5," Easy to use PDF annotations for my work, it's really really helpful and straight forward. I wish it also has a desktop app that works together with the mobile app."
66,Mark Jackson,"March 5, 2020",4," Very good handwriting editing experience on my Galaxy S Tab 3, better than the Samsung Notes app. I would like to be able to search my notes using OCR on the handwriting. Then I would give 5 stars."
67,Marco Li,"March 30, 2020",4," It is not easy to flip page in viewing mode when using a large screen device, it's better to have more ways to view a pdf"
68,Donna Rice,"April 9, 2020",3," If the designers could incorporate more writing implements i.e. calligraphy pens (these are superb in Samsung Notes) then I would give this 5 stars. So it's good, but could be brilliant."
69,Kah Ying Chong,"March 13, 2020",4," Nice app, looks great, gets the job done. Subscribed to be able to make notes on my pdf files. Wish there were more types of pens and a convert to text option though!"

71,Leviathan Sol,"April 12, 2020",5, I run multplie D&D games and Squid has helped me manage my notes and use less paper. I was going through pads of post-its and note books like crazy. Now I can still feel like I am writing while saving on paper goods.
72,Paula Quissack,"February 29, 2020",4," Awesome tool to replace paper. I use it as my notebook in college and it works. I just wish it had more options pen options. And also, the writing was more precise."

Would rate 4/5 if this bug was fixed. I wish there was a way to write on single pages while switching between pages as if in infinite size mode.

It's great as it is but if the developers for some reason see this and want to improve it a little, then I do have a few tiny nit pics. 1st. The selection too is nice but it only selects in a square. On one note you can select in any with weird shake you want. This makes it easier to omit things that would normally be in the square. Add that as an additional feature, just like the eraser. I love what you did with it. On one note, you only had the stroke erase. Which make 0 made it hard to erase little bits. I would love to be able to square select and free select. Both are useful 2nd. Additional folders. One note didn't have this and to my knowledge this doesn't really either. Just like one sub folder I think. 3rd. PDF export view. This feature would capture the screen or maybe a selection and export a PDF. Would be very nice. I do a lot of math on this and I would like to export my one equation to ask a teacher. Currently I have to copy, open a new page, paste and then export. I do not expect these to ever come to be real but if they do, Great!

One, a PDF search function so that I can search for typed keywords. The second improvement would be to separate the pen and highlighter. I take a lot of notes on pdfs a lot and I am constantly switching back and forth. Why can't the three major stylus functions be on the primary menu (pen, highlighter, & eraser)?"

However, many critical features that could make this the perfect note-taking app for chrome os are missing. For instance, you cannot scroll continuously through pages of pdfs, and you can't have more than one note open at once (for instance, marking up a pdf textbook and taking notes at the same time). The app also does not have access to local files on the computer, although I have read that this is an issue with android apps in chrome os. Squid does not support syncing to other devices or to Google drive. I have also been experiencing some crashing while working on larger notes. Otherwise, out of all the mediocre/broken ways of taking notes and drawing on chrome os that I have tried so far, this is the least mediocre/broken"

Taking notes with an active pen is really easy and practical. The interface is really nice and simple. Also a fair price for premium options which really are usefull. The fact that pdfs are exported without being splitted into a4 format (or any format for that matter) is really nice, something that can't be done in onenote for example. Some functions, however, could be better. It would be nice to import PDF files within a note so that you can annotate the PDF file (instead of importing PDF pages seperately as a new page). Also, it would also be nice to have some more figures that you can draw besides the line, square and circle (for example, 2d or 3d axis, triangle, arrows, dotted line etc.) and the option of filling a figure with a certain color. Another thing that can be better are the sync options, OneDrive or GoogleDrive are currently not supported for example."

I use the Samsung galaxy Tab A 10.1 with S Pen (which I highly recommend as a cheaper work/school tablet), and the stylus support with button and finger tools allows me to never really worry about switching between tools, as it's all contained in one hand.There would definitely be a benefit if they allowed multiple device syncing, which they don't have yet. This hasn't held me back at all, though, so 5 stars right now! I do highly recommend upgrading to the premium if you plan on using this for class or work like I do.

Should not have half the screen disappear. No, it's not the tablet. I use One Note by Microsoft, and I have none of these issues. Honestly not worth it.   I would recommend One Note, which is free and writes smoothly (plus you have access to all your notes on the web for free), or Xodo, which lets you highlight pdf's (I imported a 2000 page document, no issues scrolling entire document), also can add text, draw, and more. Going back to that, should have never left. Figured a paid app would be better than a free one, I was wrong. Really would like a refund."

Tons of different paper options as well. The only thing I wish it did better was straight lines and shapes. As a physics major, I do alot of diagramming, and would ideally like straight lines. In order to make straight lines or perfect shapes, you have to entirely select a different tool, then switch back to the regular pen. And even then you can only choose between two shapes and straight lines. I wish this were a) more seamless or atleast b) provided more options (like circles instead of just elliptical objects), or parabolas (or even better graph plotting!), or maybe just stars and stuff. But that's really the only complaint I have with it. Everything else is awesome."

Fantastic for making handwritten university class notes on the fly. I love all the different page options, templates, and sizes. The default page settings is a productivity booster. I personally upload the files as pdf's to Google Drive to have access to them from all my devices. I just *star the notes I still need to upload. This app has allowed me to go completely paperless as a student."

I would LOVE to see nested folders or simple features like duplicate page in note, duplicate note in folder, and full screen in Samsung DEX. I get occasional problems where lifting my palms off the screen will scroll the note to the other side of no man's land, which is frustrating. The scrolling and zooming in general is also a bit clunky, but overall this is a great notetaking app."

The developers seem dedicated to their product and seem to take feedback from end-users very well.

Who could have thought that you have to pay on a monthly basis to use ONE of the additional papers! There others around the corner that do much more and at a far more sensible price!
451,maryann carcamo,"January 17, 2019",5, I like the app it's good for taking notes. I use it for PowerPoint lectures. Easy to download has a writing tool and highlighter. Things I wish it had: 1. the ability to record lectures. 2. a more pigmented highlighter the color looks wispy and faint. but it does the job and I'm happy!

I changed my rating to 1 star after their response to a big problem. The text feature is incompatible with their page setups, as well as on the letter, legal, etc. page sizing options. All of your text that you entered in the text box will appear on one line.There's nothing you can do about it. It's ridiculous though. You can't read the text either because it will tell you it's ""out of bounds"" and this is after you just spent all that time entering your notes. Now your notes and time are gone. If they aren't worried about their text feature working, why is it in the description or part of the app at all? They're just advertising features that they know it doesn't have? Oh well, guess your focus is on the buck you got from me, right? Now we really know your ""#1 Priority""! Glad I didn't pay for a year. What a scam! BEWARE OF THESE PEOPLE AND THIS APP!!!"

Anyway, I've been compiling a list of features I want from Squid, in a Squid note (for irony or something). But for this review, I'd like to suggest that the devs of Squid try downloading INKredible, the leading competitor for handwritten notes (on Android at least; idk for iOS). There are a lot of similarities and differences, and pros and cons for each, but ultimately I chose to keep Squid. It wasn't an easy choice though, and I hope for Squid to improve to a point where it /would/ be an easy choice. That is, for Squid to implement all the ""pros"" without adding any of the ""cons"" of its competitor."

552,Ivan Pacheco,"January 13, 2020",3, It is seriously lacking dark mode.
553,Gaehl Hutchinson,"June 2, 2019",4, I like the app overall. the templates with the pro edition are great.

The app works great on each device and has default setting so you are able to open a note and it is the same set up as the last. You are able to restore notes from one device to another however, if you restore it erases the current device notes. I have contacted Squid asking if they have the sync feature but unfortunatly no. Hope they add this feature."

We don't write naturally with our hand up in the air but that's the only way I can use a stylus with this app and that is not enjoyable.

Even lost work because of that. Existing sync option further unsatisfactory because they use their own file format.

Alas I came across the Squid after a bit of frantic searching. I wished I could speak to some developer about what kind of a Note taking app I wanted as a student who can't carry books wherever he went. I dare say that I no longer miss my SNote.

564,Dan Thoma,"September 24, 2018",5," This is actually a great app and I bought the paid version. Pressure sensitivity, easy to change thickness, color, good templates, intuitive. If you have a stylus, it's the note taking app to have. IMO."

632,Johannes Palmer,"November 17, 2018",5, The ability to annotate pdf documents is really useful. I like the large range of note paper and natural feel of the writing action. The experience is as close to a real writing experience as I've ever have with an app.
633,John Matteson,"May 23, 2019",4," Yearly fee? Not happy about that but I've been using it for a month now and it really is an incredible app. I'm able to do just about anything, it's easy to access and easy to organize. The pen and paper options are great, paper templates for pretty much any occasion."
634,A Google user,"March 16, 2019",4, App is simple and has just enough features to be useful to the average person. Overall I like it.   My only question is:   Are there plans to add Hyperlink functionality to the software? I would like to be able to include links in the notes that I take. I would be willing to pay for it.
635,Muhammad Kamran,"September 22, 2018",4," Loving the features, however using this on an Tab S4 the ink comes out wrinkled not smooth. Also the selection of tools is tedious. Imagine doing math on this making tons of mistakes opening closing a drawer isn't efficient. Support for the a pen button would be amazing."
636,Jon Brodsky,"February 14, 2019",5," easily the best handwritten note app for my note 8. I hate other apps that force me to type, and the paper sizing here makes it easy to practice zettelkasten. only improvements I'd want would be the ability to tag and wiki link notes, but this does what I need without those."
637,Mushtaq Shaikh,"June 12, 2019",3," nice app ,was using it for 2 to 3 years but developers not adding basic features similar to Samsung notes or Notability, GoodNotes4,Noteshelf2 like apps. plz add at least Zoom in window if possible, other feature like handwriting to text conversion, global text search, multiple tabs, etc.,"
638,Christea van Zyl,"July 23, 2019",4," Amazing application. Great for me as a student. Just a pity that you need the premium to have the option to highlight, etc. Also wish more fonts came with the premium purchase. Overall very happy with the purchase."
639,Monade,"September 17, 2019",4," I really like all functions how I can manage pdf files in this app. But hope that I could find certain words by searching in the pdf files ( kinda like ctrl+f).ü§îü§îü§î This would help Squid users a lot!!! Other than that, everything is nice."
640,Min Min,"November 13, 2019",5, Nice to use but will be nicer if have more fonts for typing and more pen types for writing. Overall is okayy :)
641,Ronald Gunther,"October 30, 2018",5, Using this app on the TabS4 with a stylist and I absoulutly love the hand written note taking capabilities. The app has a great selection of paper back ground to choose from and inserting pages is a snap. Best app on my tablet!
642,Kira Smith,"November 9, 2018",5, this app has become very important to my work. being able to import pdfs and write on them has been a godsend! thank you so much for making this app! I just wish there was a faster way to switch between documents.
643,Aecel Acu√±a,"November 6, 2018",2, I uninstalled it the very second I saw you had to buy the premium version just to add text. You have to pay money... to write decent text... in a notebook app. Frankly it's insulting when there are dozens of other options. Go elsewhere people.
644,Cheryl Segal,"April 13, 2019",1, Was great until it started crashing in the last week when trying to open. Now I can't open it at all. Considered uninstalling and installing again but then I'd lose what I have saved in there.
645,Chris Davis,"September 9, 2019",1, Did not backup and all my notes are lost. I subscribed $10 a year to have the dropbox backup feature and it failed. Don't make the same mistake I did. Use an actual notebook or notepads. Or google notes - automatically saves notes to cloud for free.
646,anurag rai,"April 2, 2020",5, Hi... Please add option to Bold the text... It helps a lot while making notes...
647,Mike Burrell,"March 26, 2019",4," It's a wonderful note-taker, there is no question about that. I gave it 4 stars because it is not inter-device capable, i.e. it doesn't sync (but, admittedly, feel a touch guilty about not giving it 5 stars)."
648,A Google user,"September 5, 2019",3," I used this app few days now for taking lecture notes. This are my observations: (1) bad synchronization (2) no full screen m mode, so my wrist sometimes accidentally press back /home buttons. Overall good app still need some polishing though."
649,Mike Davis,"October 10, 2018",5," Great app for school. You can organize every class in its own folder. My only gripe is that when you add something to a previous note, it changes the date to when you made the change. Otherwise, it's great for class."
650,Ryan Johnson,"September 16, 2018",5," I love this app for note-taking with my Pixelbook. Infinite pages are awesome. Marking up a multi-page PDF is also hard to find in a notes app, but Squid makes it super easy, and it works great."
651,AJ Clarke,"November 5, 2018",4," Only thing keeping this rating from a 5 star is often times on my Pixelbook, when I zoom the screen will go black and take a second before coming back up. I have to close the app and reopen when this happens because the pen will then have significant lag"
652,Annastasia Webster,"March 25, 2019",5," I use this app all the time. I love that I can take notes in my own handwriting electronically and, with the paid version, have them automatically backed up to Dropbox so I can access my notes from any internet-connected device."
653,Alex Fairclough,"June 20, 2019",5," Excellent note taking app, delivers the features I'd hoped existed on Android before purchasing a tablet. PDF import works excellently. Captures my hand writing accurately & legibly on my Samsung Tab S3. Button gestures make for a smooth user experience."
654,ChURG !,"September 3, 2019",4," Two main issues tht letme down 1) Pop-up window mode is not working properly in NOTE 9.Whatever i write, moves slightly upwards. 2) No widget where i can use a Note directly on home screen for writing. App must be opened, which is not convenient for me."
655,Daniel,"September 9, 2019",2," Looks interesting. Could use a free trial period to test all features. Doesnt work properly on my Lenovo Yoga Book. It can't tell the difference between the pen and my hand, which is kinda annoying."
656,Hal Weber,"September 10, 2019",5, I use Squid on my Chromebook Plus V2 to teach my math class. Students can follow along with their own notes page that is identical to the PDF I can cast to screen at the front of class. I can keep all of my classes separated by course and unit. It's great!
657,Minerva Wasserman,"September 17, 2018",5, Its the best note taking app I have found for handwritten notes on a tablet. I use it for everything. The importing PDF feature is especially nice for taking notes in class.
658,Jim Douglass,"November 29, 2018",4," App works very well, except for portability. Positively the app does almost everything I want it to do and works as advertised. Negatively, the integration with google drive is poor which means what I do in Squid stays on one device."
659,Jimmy Tebbs,"September 16, 2018",1, I paid for pdf markup to test it and it isn't very good. I'd request a refund since I couldn't try it first but there is no function for that! One star will have to suffice!
660,Aaron Toderash,"April 20, 2019",4," Great app, very intuitive. The one feature I would change apps for is full screen. When using this app on a Note 8 in landscape view the extra screen real estate taken up by the controls is significant."
661,Didit Mehta Pariadi,"July 24, 2019",4," flexible and easy to use, intiutive menu and features. the capability to import pdf is a big plus. some improvement can be made like predefined pen size, auto switch between write and erase, and the option for text mode input."
662,Larry G,"November 14, 2019",4," Low-latency ink is really nice but often cuts out, so I have to disable it."
663,John Fletcher,"November 18, 2018",5, Great for working on pdf files and when using the Samsung pen great for taking notes and highlighting sections. Didn't really appreciate how good it is until I started using it regularly.
664,Fork Swing,"April 17, 2019",4," Works pretty good for note 9, good for sketching and writing your thoughts. I love the Infinite zoom out feature, its like I have one Page with everything I need and it looks like a great overall picture."
665,Brett Koger,"April 8, 2019",4, [Updated] This is my favorite note taking app. I would give it 5 stars but it doens't have Google Drive Cloud Backup intergration. Only Dropbox and box are available. It also does not sync well between devices.
666,A Google user,"October 17, 2018",5," A very useful app to quickly jot down notes in meetings. I use it on Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and the stylus makes it even more easy keep up with the pace of speaker."
667,Austin Lewellen,"September 16, 2019",4, great app. I use it for note taking in school. I ended up purchasing the subscription because it became more convenient to upload pdf's. I would give 5 stars if it were free for all options.
668,Simon Cox,"September 28, 2019",3," Good general app but one issue. I can understand the some features you have to buy, I baulk at paying a subscription though, but basic functionality that you can get on other note takers basic applications needs to be included."
669,Cherise Moore,"October 12, 2019",1," Requires premium for everything I want to do. I guess you can probably doodle for free, but that's about all. Premium is a subscription, not a purchase. Not worth it based on all I've been able to see..."
670,Furul Miah,"November 7, 2019",3," Good app, could do with arrows in the tool pack and may be a magnified import pictures, and take pictures"
671,Chris,"February 4, 2020",3, THE CHECKERBOARDING. WHYYYYYYYYY
672,Franki Maybe,"May 8, 2019",5," excellent as is, the free version is perfectly acceptable, but also the only note taking app i found thats actually worth paying for. the only subscription i have and absolutely worth 10 bucks a year."
673,Josh Friesen,"March 13, 2019",4," Very happy with it. Wish you could buy the templates you wanted, not have to subscribe. Won't be subscribing, likely would have bought a few. Works great!"
674,Administrator On-Call,"May 24, 2019",4," Got this app for work. It does everything I need it to except for one thing: I'd love it if I could insert multiple PDF files to a ""note"" at one time. Make things faster..."
675,Jesse David,"June 13, 2019",5," Love this app but after the last update it deleted all of my files for school! Hundreds of hours of note taking down the drain:( Update!:Looking at, I believe it was the fault of a new chromeos update, the update changed the location of my squid files!"
676,Nathan Campbell,"September 25, 2018",4, there is a few glitches here and there but for the mkst part it works well; I would like to see this app being updated more often sk the latency lag is less likely to happen.
677,Rudy Turner,"November 4, 2018",4," Excellent app. Would like to see a more robust tool menu to make transition between erase, select and write quicker. Would also like to be able to scroll with 1 finger instead of erasing."
678,Becky Carter,"November 17, 2019",4," works really well, love the option to import pdf's. Wish you Could nest folders."
679,Paul Erlenwein,"April 27, 2019",4," Very nice app, definitely worth it's subscription fee. I'd really love to be able to cut from pdfs though - that's a very important feature simply missing in this app."
680,Benjamin Yu,"November 1, 2018",3, There are a lot of times I feel like the app is not fluid ot what I need it for such as easy jpeg or pdf writing. It's possible that the premium features have this unlocked but so possibly a trial version maybe? Great App though!
681,stealingthesun,"November 15, 2018",5," This is an incredibly useful app for my Chromebook. Handwriting my notes has never been so satisfying--and, I can still doodle on my pages (this app is a very good double for a drawing one as well!)"
682,Jose Espinoza,"April 10, 2019",5, Great app so far. Been using it alot to take notes and not need to take a notebook anywhere I go now. using it on a Samsung tab A. Would be nice to have a feature where we can permanently rotate a PDF...
683,Olly The Old,"October 29, 2018",5," Fantastic for notetaking, general writing. I use it extensively on my galaxy tab for character sheets. Being able to manipulate and interact with what you've written in previous sessions is invaluable."
684,serhat can,"November 27, 2018",5," Very easy to use and adapt to. However capabilities could be more, for example a zoom out box to inrease noting space for small parts of a text would give much more possibility for note taking."
685,AJ Alvero,"May 20, 2019",1," No way to organize notes - this feature was requested six years ago in their website. That's right - six years ago. The app layout is not optimized for Chrome OS yet (see Evernote). Until then, I'm keeping this 1 star rating."
686,Rich Siciliano,"March 4, 2019",5," I'm not crazy about subscriptions, but this app is the only one with the features I need. Great for designing furniture and cabinets on graph paper."
687,Diya Parelkar,"August 4, 2019",2," waste app.. all the cool and important features are paid.. without the premium package you can only write,erase and select..moreover there is only one type of brush available where you can adjust the pressure and size... Didn't find it much helpful..."
688,kerenskable,"October 1, 2019",1, I wanted to buy writing on pdf and the toolpack. It was not made clear that I could only get toolpack on squid premium. So now I've wasted 4.79 because I cant highlight on a pdf. What a total rip- off. Also the squid website is totally unhelpful and you cant even search it.
689,Amine Bouguergouh,"November 9, 2019",4," Great app for taking notes, however the Gdrive autosync/restore that isn't available is a deal breaker"
690,Chris Petrula,"May 22, 2019",5, Awesome. I tried almost all of the similar apps and this is by far the best in terms of ease of use and functionality. It's extremely responsive with no lag between pen and render.
691,Con Vex,"February 17, 2019",2, The interface and everything is great but the writings are not smooth when you zoom in on them. They look like made out of straight lines rather than smooth curves.
692,Arel Cordero,"November 21, 2018",2," Useful app, but it has issues backing up notes and I lost months of notes. Active stylus works better than other apps like Google Keep. It's nice to annotate PDFs but tedious to read them! :-/"
693,Garip tatoo,"September 11, 2019",1," Unfortunately I have to use this app because there is no other choice. I'm pissed off for developer because the app does not have any subordinate function for this app. The free apps or the simplest apps have this feature, but this app does not. What is still very bad, developer wants that the user ...Full ReviewUnfortunately I have to use this app because there is no other choice. I'm pissed off for developer because the app does not have any subordinate function for this app. The free apps or the simplest apps have this feature, but this app does not. What is still very bad, developer wants that the user must vote for subordinate function. What shoud that? all universities are open now, when do you want to bring this function? end of study year?"
694,Amy Mitchell,"October 21, 2019",5," Love this app so far! I use this to store all of my music for the many choruses I'm in. I have them all in separate folders, and I can mark my music as well. (I have the paid version of the app)"
695,Amanda Toronto,"May 6, 2019",4, Good app. I like that it allows me to sign things and send without needing to print. Still think it could be quicker with downloading and saving things.
696,A Google user,"October 8, 2018",5," Super useful for saving money on textbooks for classes. I still get to highlight and take notes to my heart's content, but I avoid the costs of traditional college textbooks. Win-win."
697,Dania Ismadi,"February 14, 2019",4," Everything is great but could you make the scrolling, panning and zooming in and out within the page smoother? It lags quite a bit!"
698,Jongho Lee,"September 25, 2018",5," Does as advertised. Works well and the ability to insert pdf into the notes is a thumbs up for me. However, I wish they could have added backup to Google Drives."
699,Nimisha Tayal,"September 29, 2018",5, It is really helpful for annotating PDFs and is a good note taking app. I think it is definitely worth a dollar a month for the expanded features.
700,GIGA STORE,"April 8, 2019",2," to access eraser tool is not smart. we should switch many times between eraser and pen. the best way, both should be separated with one click access. now i am looking for another one in playstore."
701,Trina Taylor,"December 14, 2018",5," This was amazing. I turned my instructor's PowerPoints into PDFs and then took class notes right on the slides with my tablet. Absolutely the best for relating my notes to the relevant class material. No, more paper notebooks for me."
702,patrick knowles,"November 8, 2018",2," This app is fantastic, but it doesn't support backup to Google Drive which I think is a MAJOR downfall. Otherwise it would be a 5 star app. *Sidenote* S-Pen support is fantastic"
703,Mixx Milkz,"August 7, 2019",4," I use this app for note taking. It is easy to use with MediaPad M5. On the other hand, when Iscaled the objects, It might be a little bit hard to scale it."
704,Fatima Marhoon,"August 29, 2019",4," Great app, but it would be nice if you can add a presetting pens option, it would make note taking much smoother. It would also be nice if you can add google drive and an export location in addition to dropbox and box"
705,Momao-92,"August 31, 2019",5," It is very useful. I would recommed it, but keep your notes to a4 if you are planning to print them later because with an ""infinite"" note is difficult to predict how it falls on the page. üëç"
706,Victoria Triglia,"September 13, 2019",4, I really like the way it is set up and the features it has. The only complaint I have is that I cannot open more than one document at a time. So I cant mark a pdf file and take notes on another document at the same time (that I know of).
707,adam daly,"February 1, 2019",5," makes my work and home projects so much easier. take a pic of a wall, write dimensions on it, add next wall next to it. unlimited sheet size is brilliant and the export to pdf is amazing. fantastic app!"
708,Giacomo Vischio,"December 10, 2018",3," Great app. One of the most useful app for taking notes. Just one fault: it doesn't have multi-devices sync, not even with the Premium pack"
709,shinebrighterthananyone,"February 18, 2019",3, It's good! Would love to set the opening page to one of the notebooks I created instead of showing the recent notes. Also would love to have more drawing options /tools.
710,Dan Waggoner,"October 20, 2018",5, Have had this for years but bought a S3 with the S Pen and takes it to a whole new level. It is like having a huge piece of paper with a lot of colored pens to take notes. Outstanding
711,Bobbi Van Riet,"February 26, 2019",1," Sorry but as a writer there is simply no sense in having an app I can't save my work in and access from another device. If this option were available, I'd give Squid 5 stars as I loved everything else about this app ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
712,Ryan Hill,"March 22, 2019",3," Nice for taking notes, but lacks text recognition and sometimes lags significantly. I would also appreciate having the ability to clean up shapes and diagrams."
713,John Drazan,"June 17, 2019",5," great note app. only suggestion is to add the ability to draw ""filled"" shapes. also, it would be great to be able to draw arrows."
714,Michael Luigi Manzano,"August 25, 2019",4, This is what i am looking for! Only 2 things i needed for this app: 1. Sync from my android device to my windows laptop. 2. Set transparency of paper so i can trace my drawing on top of it on the next page.
715,Jesse Clark,"October 27, 2019",5, Great writing app. Very easy to take notes. I use an S-pen when I use this app and it's fantastic. This app has changed the way I do homework and taking notes.
716,Mushahid Khan,"February 23, 2020",5, good app...but it should have much more brush options
717,Paolo Mazzetti,"February 7, 2019",4," Please add a squid extention so I can send notes and people with squid can delete/modify things, not possible if the note is a pdf. Please add the possibility of choosing pages with fixed point in order to make perfect parallel or perpendicular lines"
718,A Google user,"September 21, 2018",5," I'm having problem with the paper. Everyday I always study about math and circuit topics, and i needed paper to use as scratching paper.Using paper as a scratch is consuming a lot.So I decided to search for this app and it has everything i need , everything bro!"
719,Margie Savage,"April 17, 2019",1, Worked when I first installed it but hasn't been opening images for annotation for several months now. A bit disappointed. It has potential if it worked as it did when I first installed it.
720,Emmanuel Tamarez,"February 18, 2019",5," Using squid with my samsung chrome book pro has been truly a pleasure to work with. I am able to open PDF's, sign documents and take notes all in one app. I would recommend its best use is with a stylus."
721,John L,"April 12, 2019",4," The writing experience is amazing, but the inability to have subfolders is a big drawback. I like how lecturenotes allows you to have subfolders and organize notes better."
722,Mariusz Przybytek,"April 18, 2019",5," Great for working with PDFed books. Love it for jotting my notes, adding photos, scribbling and drawing. I wish there was a choice of pens, pencils amd brushes."
723,My Phone,"May 17, 2019",5, Love using it with my Huawei Mate 20 X and M Pen. The only additional feature I'd like to see is a fullscreen mode that hides the menu bars (and ideally the android notification bar as well).
724,Joshua Olivarez,"May 13, 2019",4," Best notes on Chromebook! I use it with split screen to take notes on Khan Academy. The add-ons are kind of expensive, but over all it's a good app."
725,Perry Griffin,"July 8, 2019",5," Favorite handwritten note app by a million miles. Not without some fine tuning or wanted features, but I stopped trying out other apps after I tried this. (gimme color backgrounds in all page formats T.T )"
726,Chelsia Chan,"August 31, 2019",5, Super awesome note taking app. It captures your handwriting so effortlessly and accurately. 100% as though as you are writing on the paper. If only it is available on windows 10 too!
727,Alexandra Peters,"September 3, 2019",4," Great app for university note-taking on powerpoints! Would give a 5 star review if you could type next to pdf as well as write on them. My only complaint. But few other pdf note-taking apps for chromebook, so I'll take it!"
728,Katherine Myers,"August 31, 2019",5," I use Squid everyday and love it! For lists and schedules it's the best. No problems, just a smooth working app that does what it's supposed to do."
729,gopalan velunni,"March 3, 2020",1, All nice thing are on premium üò≠
730,Lex Moga,"October 25, 2018",5," Excellent app for studying. I was struggling with reading my books but now i can just download them into squid and read them. It also allows you to mark, highlight and mark on the key points. Thnx"
731,Kaan,"January 10, 2019",5, Amazingly convenient to sync with Dropbox and export pdfs there. Really responsive to strokes. Minimalistic but offer everything you need if you intend to replace your notebook with your tablet-pen.
732,Russell Smiley,"September 21, 2018",5," This is the best sketching and note taking app I've found. Perhaps some extra pen styles would be good for sketching diagrams, but I also get the minimalist focus on simple, effective note taking."
733,alexander torkelsen,"September 9, 2019",2," Completely unable to subscribe to the premium features of this app. Tried several payment methods but none of them worked. Looks like a good app, but too bad i'm not able to use the features I need because of the app not allowing me to pay!"
734,Roger Sharp,"November 15, 2019",3," This is a good useful app, well done! But why would I pay when one note is free?"
735,Daad Bassel,"March 8, 2019",4, It's a great app I always use it to take notes I just wish they'd add more features to it like a recorder and also add more varieties to the type of files that I can upload
736,Jessica Hill,"October 22, 2018",5, I love the lined paper design. This is the most satisfactory note app I've tried in regards to the feel. I hope to see more widget options in the future
737,Diane ODonnell,"March 1, 2019",5," LOVE IT for taking notes on blank documents and PDF's! Easy to use for editing, and organizing files. Everything I need."
738,A Google user,"January 5, 2019",5," Works Great! As an adjuster this app has allowed me to go paperless. No more printing out estimates. I just download PDF's, mark up as needed and save. Love it!"
739,Storm,"January 11, 2019",5, Probably the best hand writing app for notes on Android. Wish it had better support for typing so I didnt have to use two apps though. Also having a subcategory to the notebooks would be lovely.
740,Alex Soustek,"December 3, 2018",4," Very solid note taking app, love the different kinds of paper. Wishing there were some shapes that we're free to use (boxes, lines/arrows, circle)"
741,Andy Eyre,"September 22, 2018",5, Absolutely fantastic on my Pixelbook (+Pen)! My go to note taking and journal writing and an essential tool for my academic studies! The ability to upload PDFs and then to make notes on the pen is amazing!
742,A Google user,"September 16, 2018",5," Its a very nice app, really help me with every kind of anotation. I would like to see a directory sistem. Instead of see my documents i could see the directories, something like that."
743,Jules Fishwick,"September 17, 2018",5," I love this app, I use it on my pixelbook and my phone to take class notes and highlight our pdf readings for classes. it's just what I was looking for!"
744,Shaun Morgan,"December 31, 2018",5, Since getting my note I have been looking for the best writing app for notes and doing homework. This is awesome with the paid feature of .pdf import. I have tried about a dozen apps and prefer Squid.
745,Fernanda Lomel√≠,"April 24, 2019",5," I love this app, is very useful. My only complaint would be the text box, it would be better to add text directly to the page and not through a text box."
746,C SUN,"February 15, 2019",5," Squid is super useful for editing PDFs. You can mock them up in various colors, various pen widths, etc. There is no pen lag--couldn't be happier :)"
747,Laserbean 00001,"April 26, 2019",5, Love it. i almost never use paper now. Can you make it so we can permanently buy a background? instead of subscribing to premium just to get one background.
748,Kevin McGerty,"May 23, 2019",2," Unreliable now a few times -- files fail to save to pdfs, which makes the utility essentially useless for me. If this happens again I will have to find another application to use."
749,A Google user,"March 14, 2019",4, One of the best note taking apps. Definitely 5 stars if they add Google Drive as a cloud storage option and the ability to hide the dock on a Chromebook when taking a note.
750,Jesus Remorosa,"February 6, 2019",5," I've tried several handwritten notes app. Squid gives me more flexibility and ease of use. I just hope there will be more templates available in the future,."
751,Ethan Hamilton,"February 2, 2019",5, This is a beautiful app that allows me to take all of my notes and do my assignments in one place. Subscription is super cheap too and is easily worth the investment.
752,HARMINDER GILL,"March 7, 2019",4," Useful app, integrates well with stylus usage. Cloud storage, gesture navigation and the ability to change the colour of your paper would make it better!"
753,Paul Hohmann,"September 23, 2019",3," A fine app except for one thing: I'm not interested in subscribing for functionality that should be included in a basic application. A one time reasonable purchase, sure."
754,Ragƒ±p G√ºrlek,"September 28, 2019",5, The app is great. The only major flaw is lack of ability to view the notes on my dekstop. I have to export and send to my desktop if I need a note.
755,Amy Miller,"May 21, 2019",4," awesome note taking app, just wish I was also able to upload as a word doc and PowerPoint. I have to keep converting the format. Otherwise, nice app."
756,A Google user,"March 28, 2019",5, Really good for taking notes and/or drawing and sketching on the galaxy s4 tablet. I have only used the free version so far as well.

This way I can show my learners exactly how to do their problems step-by-step. It is just the best whiteboard casting app I've tried! I started out on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10, using only my finger, but I now use a Galaxy Tab S4. What a great experience writing with stylus and erasing with my finger! Thank you for the greatest teaching app!"
758,Damon Singh,"November 25, 2018",4, Please add the ability to change page background color from white to other shades. (the current templates vary in line patterns but not line/background color)
759,Swapan Mukherjee,"January 17, 2019",2, The funniest thing is that the title bar of a note is at the bottom of each note. So inconvenient! The Header is at the Footer level! Lol!
760,Brian Cruz,"April 3, 2019",5, Absolutely love the app. Use it on the daily for my job. Only knock is not having the notes readily available via cloud but thats a minor issue for me
761,Henry Nguyen,"December 19, 2018",5," Great handwriting app. I use it quite often recently. It would be great if the app have ""create folder"" function so that I can organize my note in different folders."
762,Nadie qwq,"October 1, 2019",3, Good app overall. Easy to export files in different formats. A pity you have to switch between the pen and the eraser using a single button.
763,Ben Allchin,"March 16, 2019",4, Really good app to make notes on pdfs. Would be great if it included being able to make notes on Word docs (bit annoying having to convert everything to pdf first)
764,Tina Newman,"May 12, 2019",5," The most important thing is it is SO easy to use. You don't have to be a computer genius to use it. nice format, simple changes... love it!"
765,Antti Ver√§j√§nkorva,"March 10, 2019",5," awesome app for writing with s-pen. can't survive without it. extra bonus, it doesn't have stupid notifications about stuff you don't care anyway."
766,Ed Holtby,"December 20, 2018",4," So far so good. Would be better if there were more options for exporting different levels of image quality, to help manage pdf size."
767,Ely Vargas L,"January 11, 2019",5," using this for college, I love it! I do wish you can swipe through the pages of the notebook. but it's done so well! Thank you!"
768,Megan Blank,"January 6, 2019",4, App is great for marking up pdfs. It is a little difficult to write words on and when scrolling you have to use two fingers or you make marks.
769,Pablo Urz√∫a,"May 4, 2019",5, Really nice app. Can you make an option to disable the two finger scroll option. Sometimes im writing and with the side part of my hand i scroll the page by mistake.
770,Renais Nisbett,"February 6, 2019",5," This is a great app, especially for phablets like the Samsung Galaxy Note series. I would recommend this app to those who have decided to root their device and run a ASOP Rom."
771,Richard Yen,"October 12, 2018",5," Pretty much the best Free handwriting app, and believe me I've tried them all. This is prolly the first time I've thought about buying the an apps full version."
772,Mohammad Nazmus Sakib,"January 19, 2019",5, Excellent app with a of functions. You can erase with finger tip. That's very handy. It's the best among all available handwriting apps. Highly recommend it.
773,Erica Franke,"November 18, 2018",5," the best note taking app out there. It's barebones, but it WORKS. the low-latency ink is a game changer."
774,A Google user,"November 3, 2018",4, It's a nice app with a lot of features that include letting the user take pics and add PDFs. I would give 5 start if I could add folders.
775,Beth English,"October 24, 2018",5, This app is great for making lecture notes. Its made my 3rd year so much easier! I wish I had had it from the start of my degree! Cannot recommend it enough
776,William Scheidegger,"June 14, 2019",1, I can't believe there has been a feature request open for literally years to get palm rejection added. This is a total deal breaker and it is now uninstalled.
777,David Lucas,"September 12, 2019",2," Happy to consider paying for an upgrade, however the subscription model is not something I'd would consider and since there is no other option, I'll uninstall."
778,Austin Gray,"September 12, 2019",4, This app has great support for handwritten notes and a great pdf import system. The text notes are definitely lacking thought. Adding think like links in text would go a long way
779,Stacey Waters,"January 15, 2019",5, Paid for the premium version (cost of two Starbucks trips) and now I can mark pdf student assignments just like on a paper copy using the Google pixel pen and send a PDF as feedback. Very happy.
780,Jose Martinez,"December 21, 2018",3," I'm really enjoying this app so far but when I start writing towards the right edge in portrait, there's major latency with where I'm writing and where the words actually appear"
781,Jeremy,"February 11, 2019",3, Freeze on Pixelbook.  I experience freeze for several seconds in every 1 or 2 mins. I'm using the latest version of chrome os. Please fix it ASAP.
782,Jaime Matamala,"April 1, 2019",4, Great app. Get it job done. I would like more sharing and organizing capabilities to the notes taken. Major development in common apps integration should be done
783,Jeff Kime,"December 17, 2018",5, great note app for my chromebook. love the ability to mark up pdf documents and images. Love the ability to mark up computer generated forms like it was paper.
784,Ashley Williams,"November 7, 2018",2, It's annoying not being able to rotate pages. No copy of pasting when docs are imported and tools are limited compared to a free desk doodling app.
785,Jonathan Wilding,"August 7, 2019",5, I love that you can print really easily! It would be nice if there was an option for lined paper with the standard margins.
786,Claudia Werckle,"September 25, 2019",5," Versatile and worth the little bit each month for PDF importing if you need to take notes on PDF regularly. Great options for backgrounds, colors, etc."
787,Gabriel Ortiz,"October 29, 2019",4, I like this app because of the Pixelbook Pen and so far it has stayed true to this mission. I look forward to more updates that support the Pixelpen.
788,Jacqueline Davis,"September 25, 2018",3," It's good, but the subscription feature just to get other important tools you just might need to use is a turnoff for me."
789,John Hee Park,"February 27, 2019",4, Great app! It needs finger/hand scrolling for PDF viewing though. Scrolling through pages pressing the arrow buttons every time is inconvenient.
790,LMNTRIX TYSON,"January 1, 2019",5, I loved it. But I'm unhappy with its one feature( synch ur data to the google drive) that is only for premium membership.
791,Bevan Noronha,"November 16, 2018",5," Amazing app for taking notes, and upgrading it is so economical and beneficial for me, since I am a university student. Loving it."
792,Hend Alsaleh,"March 16, 2019",5," easy, good number of options, good range of colors and easy transfer. love how you can add pdf as pages into a document and vice virsa"
793,Daniel Clarke,"November 19, 2018",4," This is a terrific tool, but a few basic features are needed: rotate graphics, background fade, and custom pen colour."
794,Arnaud A,"June 26, 2019",4," great app, would be perfect with better features to sort out notes, as well as larger integration of cloud services (box and dropbox are not enough)"
795,Kris Hudson-Lee,"July 13, 2019",2," So much amazing potential totally and utterly killed for me by the lack of sync with Google Drive. I want to love and use it, but I'll be sticking with s-note for now."
796,Nizam Mohamed,"September 11, 2019",4, Productive software but still could use some improvements. I like that you can vote on feature requests but I don't see any of the ones I'm interested in being implemented.
797,Peter Balazs,"October 20, 2019",4," Great app but it could be more stylus-friendly. Could you add some new features like: long press + move = scroll the page, double tap + move up / double tap + move down = zoom? Rotation?"
798,Sam Norman,"October 25, 2019",5," Great app to jot down quick notes, plan out paper ideas, and make reading annotations. Been using it for 3+ years now, and will continue to use this great product!"
799,Oren Yahud,"January 13, 2020",5," Very convenient, great UI"
800,Georg Mayer,"April 20, 2019",4," for sure the best pen-app | found. could offer faster and simpler way to change from peu to eraser to select etc, e. g. a configurable tool bar. Thank you for a great product!"
801,Hagai Ofer,"December 11, 2018",4," Nice app , could use more option for coloring shapes and tools like ruller and compas for arches. But simple to use app and does the job pretty well."
802,Clive Roberts,"November 11, 2018",4," Overall functional. It would be useful if the developer would consider introducing note ""tags"" and ""Google Drive"" storage."
803,A Google user,"February 26, 2019",5, Easy to use and stable application. Make drawings using freehand or shape tools. Optional grid screens make proportional sketches easy.
804,PuroClean Lethbridge,"May 2, 2019",5, Since using this app on my tablet... I've hardly had to use a piece of paper. Great app... fits the bill for what I need.
805,Harry Gaffney,"March 8, 2019",3, I would prefer it if there was some way to access our notes online instead of exporting as a PDF and searching through your files to find them.
806,D. Karin Meyer,"September 19, 2019",3," So far, really like this ( when I obtain a stylus will be workable). I t seems a bit harsh to charge for a realistic eraser and to add typing."
807,Sanath Gowda,"September 26, 2019",2," Chromecast doesn't work and subscription model is too expensive for basic features, it should have been one time fees. Ui can improve for taking notes."
808,Sean Lowther,"October 24, 2019",5," Brilliant app for taking Notes and making Notes on pdfs. Would benefit from a feature of importing PowerPoints directly rather than saving them as pdfs first, but can't really fault the app at all"
809,Udez,"October 30, 2019",4, All it's missing are more pen options and multi-device synchronization
810,HARSHAL BANE,"April 18, 2020",3, Although Good.But plz make the import pdf's free plz it is a necessity for the app.Or else it would be good now it is only ok
811,Benjamin Sage,"November 6, 2018",5, Great app for writing notes and drawing. Pixelbook Pen support works great. Text input tool could definitely be improved.
812,Brian Haker,"February 22, 2019",5," Write with stylus, done, no need for ""save"" Pity no sub folders, would've been greatest since slice bread. Also longer pages would've been great. Love it though"
813,joseph samman,"December 3, 2018",5, Great app paired with an s-pen. I take notes for all of my classes and I've saved a ton of paper by importing PDFs and note taking right on the device!
814,K Nagarjuna Reddy,"July 18, 2019",5, Awesome. User Friendly. pdf editor/ exporting / attaching images / page backdrop/are the highlights of this app. Loving to write more.Thank U Squid Team for the wonderful app.
815,Skyler Jessee,"September 11, 2019",4," A pretty basic note taking app, which makes it easy to use, especially with the great stylus support."
816,J. H. Louie n√©e Purdin,"September 18, 2019",4, This is a nice tool for notetaking. I just wish it made it easier to break down an imported pdf into smaller bits.
817,bhargav blaze,"October 23, 2019",1, Why is this app not optimised for my s pen?? Samsung galaxy Tab s6 is the only premium android tablet available.... why r you guys not supporting my s pen?

818,Sorawij T,"October 19, 2019",5, Almost perfect. Should have add the feature to open multiple files at the same time. The rest works very fine.
819,Abhishek More,"January 8, 2020",5, Best app for taking short notes and save in pdf format. Wonderful app
820,Vasileios Agathangelidis,"October 24, 2018",2, Everything that needs payment in this app is for free in the app called xodo docs. We will not pay for importing a pdf !!!! We are android users and not apple sheep consumers!!!
821,Daniel Bordner,"May 25, 2019",5, Love it on my Samsung Chromebook pro! on my Pixel 2 phone and pixel c tablet it is just good. The Chromebook has a nice special stylist that is absolutely amazing for this app.
822,Arne Puschmann,"March 3, 2019",4," Best app for Galaxy devices regarding handwriting by far. it's lacking essential feature like live synchronization and editing remote documents, though."
823,Pete T.,"January 28, 2019",4, Great Application! I really enjoyed using it. Squid runs very fast and smoothly. 1 Star is missing because of no multi device synchronization
824,Henrique Perroni,"April 3, 2019",4, It needs the option to export a range of pages as well as specific pages by number (image and pdf).
825,Rebecca Dwyer,"November 12, 2018",5," Did what I needed it to do! No app shutdowns, very easy to use, and easily share and upload edited files to utilise on other devices as needed!"

829,Anusha Prasad,"March 8, 2020",2, It is a really good app but mostly everything thing is premium

831,Connor Chen,"July 29, 2019",5, Lag issue got explained. Got no solution for that yet since it's issue from Google's side. Overall it's a really great note taking app.
832,Patrick Poe,"January 15, 2019",5, Pay for the full version. I think its worth it. My kids use it even more than I do. Best way to keep them quiet and peaceful out in public.
833,Robert Jean,"March 26, 2019",1, Can't even try out the markup features of pdf files.. The developer must have provided full featured app atleast for a few days for potential buyers decide before purchasing it..
834,PamalaW,"January 31, 2019",3, I got this on my Kindle Fire and paid for the premium before realizing I can't sync to my phone.. and even have to pay for it separately if I want it on both devices.. sigh                                RE: their response:  BUT you could provide a code to unlock it

836,Forbes 58,"October 29, 2018",5, Wharf a great app much better than carrying a note pad and pen since I had an operation in my mouth to remove my cancerous tounge my speech is awful so finding this saves buying note pads and pens it's really easy to use thank you squid
837,Zamir Zahran,"May 28, 2019",1, Visually appealing - yes But mostly useless. Unless you buy the app which has good features. I would recommend other apps such as Onenote by Microsoft instead!
838,Brett Markman,"September 4, 2019",1," 3rd time installing /uninstalling. Moving on to other options. Pixelbook 4Mb, no tabs open. Not able to draw anything using finger or 2 styluses that I have.Have about 15 extensions."

850,kenan ozbay,"May 21, 2019",1, I paid money for it to upgrade before it was subscription but they wouldn't home that. Don't spend your money on it. Not worth it anyway!
851,Darwin Reyes,"November 1, 2018",2, I found it a bit deceiving. It said I could use it to Mark up PDFs but it didn't say only in the upgraded version. I deleted it right away.

854,Kevin H,"September 23, 2018",4, Really cheap for the whole package and great for taking notes! The stylus system just isn't that optimized yet so the writing is a little off.
855,Harrison Hennessy,"September 27, 2018",5, Most useful notetaking app I've tried. Brilliant interface and PDF import function if you pay for the subscription which is worth it. Fantastic.
856,Mark Kudron,"March 8, 2019",4, My favorite of all the note taking and PDF readers that allow me to mark up documents. Wish it could sync across devices

858,A Google user,"December 13, 2018",4," Please, add an option to add voice memos and web links to notes. Would be very usefull during lectures to leave some voice memos for myself."
859,mike genova,"March 7, 2019",5, I am an electrical Engineering student and I do all my homework on a tablet with squid. it works really well and can also be used for taking notes in class. i tried all the other note taking apps and this one is the best for school purposes.

870,Caleb Khaw,"September 24, 2019",5," Would love it even more if I could preview it on my desktop without having to extract PDF and if it allowed me to sync instead of a 6 hour backup interval. Lastly, please give us google drive support!"

874,Pierre Boniface,"May 12, 2019",4," I'm interested but s-note still seam to be the king of note taking. But if you were to add shape recognition, charts and maybe a basic pop-up calculator, my and probably many other s-pen users money would soon be in your pocket."
875,Johan van der Vyver,"May 4, 2019",4," Works very well, but lacks a few key features one would have expected, e.g. search capability."
876,Abhinav Garg,"December 4, 2018",5, Please make the feature of marking pdf in full screen mode and palm rejection feature. Otherwise everything is awesome about this app.

I don't use a pen and literally just draw with my finger. You can also drop images in if you're not a strong artist.

1644,Piotr,"April 27, 2020",1, They do not allow you to use a proper eraser unless you pay. Free eraser remove parts of drawing instead of area you touch so you need to start that parts drawing again from the beginning. Fortunately many good apps out there allow that without being forced to pay for basic features.

I used Squid on both a Tab S6 tablet and a Note 10 plus, but the notes don't sync, which makes this app useless to me.

The developers made the case for how a subscription model helps them put time into making this app better but there's been nothing added to make that compelling, it's all just more background skins.

I'm able to easily organize my notes into notebooks, add pages to my notes, and even change whether I'm writing with notebook paper lines, graph paper, or plane white. And did I mention you can change the colors and thickness of the ink? Now, I'm not a fan of subscribing to things - the freemium version of Squid will do almost everything you need for notetaking, and I'm very happy with it. I did some in-app purchases for typing on the screen and adding shapes, and those have been worthwhile and affordable. --- Update: I now also have the app on my phone, and alas there is no way to sync the notes from my phone and my Chromebook. However, both my phone and Chromebook automatically backup my notes to Dropbox every day as PDF's, and it's easy to export the really important notes to specific folders in my Google Drive (and other online platforms) as needed. Plus you can't beat the control for line thickness, color, and page background. Granted, you get even better backgrounds (including daily planner) if you sign up for premium, and I can't afford that. But with a few in-app purchases you can get PDF and JPG import, which will them provide any background you could possibly want. I actually use the app to take photos and then draw sketches over the photos. Once the sketch is done, I copy the lines over to a plain white background, and voila - a nice cartoon image. Do if you're looking for a versatile and dependable notes app with automatic backup, I think this may be your best bet."

I said yes.. then palm rejection worked.. I also see options for input which says finger or active pen.... thanks a lot team for introducing this feature.... this is what I thought was one of the drawback previously... now the squidnotes application is excellent with this feature..... 5 stars for this app... even if there is 5 more stars, I would like to give..

UPDATE: After using this app for almost 2 years now, I must say that this is still my app of choice for taking notes in school. Nice colors, for smooth writing and prints fantastically. The biggest problem with other apps is their inability to provide a straightforward way to get notes into PDF properly for printing purposes. Squid is the way to go for taking notes in school, writing assignments and printing.  Only thing I would change in this app is a way to save my notes to the SD card. After almost 2 years, I am running out of space on the pre-installed storage. Also, the lack of a way to export an entire notebook means that I have to manually export each note as PDF to copy that notebook to my long-term storage. That is very tedious but looks like I have no other way to save my notes and free-up space.  My advice for newbies is to export your notes daily or weekly and at the end of a semester delete the notebook to save space. You will thank me later.  Thank the developers for a very useful note-taking app."

No collaboration, no ability to rearrange notes within a notebook, and most importantly, NO SYNC. This is almost laughable! What powerful note taking app doesn't sync? Doing manual backups and restorations is not only archaic, it is a major liability. How easy is it to lose an entire year of work by accidentally resorting an incorrect backup? Come on guys, this is a no brainer. UPDATE: I dropped from three stars to two stars. I have lost numerous documents because of the lack of syncing options. Also, there has been more than enough time for Squid to update their app to allow automatic syncing. While I understand you can set an automatic cloud update, this is still not helpful because you have to manually restore a backup EVERY SINGLE TIME you use a different device. It is ridiculous."

The strokes with the Pixel Pen are pressure sensitive to increase and decrease the thickness too. You have to pay a couple bucks for the rest of the templates, but it's not a bad price for an app. You can increase page size and change the dimensions to that of different paper standards, add lines or grids, and export to pdf, jpeg, or png. You can also add multiple pages to a single note and organize notes into different notebooks. Works with just a finger too! Lastly, (and I like this feature a lot), you can import pdfs. Great for doing homework right on the assignment. Feature request: add layers for additional drawing tools.

I'm definitely able to use this to get work done and for the most part it stays out of my way. I will mention, since sometimes the devs read these, that I find the UI to be a bit clunky at times. For instance, I am often transfering between different modes (pencil, highlight, etc) and each transfer takes two button presses followed by a menu-clearing action. I really feel like this should be doable in a single action. Additionally, I am often times switching between different colors/thicknesses or have things that I am copying and pasting regularly. Two very useful features would be (a) color/line-thickness presets for both shapes and writing, and (b) a 'palette' where figures I have drawn can be saved for later use. A walk through of (b) would be: i. I draw a figure and decide to save it for later ii. I highlight the figure and touch button 'add-to-palette', adding the highlighted figure. iii. Later, I want to reuse my figure. I select the palette icon which presents a dropdown of thumbnail icons of each figure. iv. I select one figure and it pastes to the screen"

There are, however, a few features that I wish could be added/modified. It would be nice if you could erase specific areas of something you've written or drawn, instead of erasing everything that I wrote/drew prior to lifting my pen (ex: cursive). I also wish that it were an option to turn handwriting into text and be able to convert it into a Google Doc for easier edits later on. I love handwriting notes because I feel like I can retain the information better, but sometimes, I like the look of typed notes better and I don't always have time to type my notse after writing them. Lastly, it would be really nice to be able to multitask while using the app. I often watch lecture videos and read my electronic textbooks on my Google Pixelbook while taking notes on the screen, and only being able to do one or the other in tablet mode is not very efficient.

Subscriptive services is one of the reasons I no longer use microsoft products, I would simply like to buy my software outright. That being said, given the quality of software, I wouldn't be apposed to paying for premium content. EDIT: Read their reasoning on the website and can't really say I blame them. I would argue that I paid $50 before for far less useful software and I would gladly pay upwards of that for Squid, but I suppose markets change, yeah, oh well. If there's a suggestion box, add notebook covers to the UI in recent notes, so that I don't have to open the hamburger menu to sort."

This app includes support for PDF markup, pressure-sensitive styli, images, geometry (rectangles, loops & lines), selection tool, infinite canvas, and tons of other options. My only wish was that this also came on the Windows Store so I could view/sync my notes on my computer. The premium version is easily worth five times the price they charge. Notes never become blurry thanks to the vector-based build. It would be nice if it were possible to pin toolbars (like the color and tool picker) open so that changing ink color‚Äîor switching between the pen and selection tool‚Äîare just one tap away.

to give iOS apps like GoodNotes/Notability/NoteShelf a run even Xodo for 
Android, maybe consider a one-time purchase cost. I'm not paying $10 - $12 
per year for full functionality when I also own an iPad with these paid 
apps that functions well. I was hoping to not have to purchase an iPad Mini 
and was hopeful that I could purchase a smaller Android tablet to keep in 
my purse and use your app. Unfortunately, that idea has worn away with the 
monthly fee to use the app. If you offered your app for $10 straight, I 
would buy it. But $10 - $12 per year? No. Other than that, this app really

set of backgrounds to use. If you want to use more or import your own, you 
can't just upgrade to a one off premium version. You have to purchase a 
monthly subscription which is just not worth it. This one money making 
measure for me limits the usefulness of this app. I have purchased the 
tools upgrade for ¬£2.89. This lets me use all the tools (highlighter, etc.)

having to wait a long time for those pages to lead, which makes me miss 
some of the notes I want to take down. This is very important to me as 
university classes are very fast paced and profs don't wait for anyone. One 
suggestion would be to have the option to flatten the document as you 
import it onto the app. I personally don't care to have my pages be 
flattened, as I won't be needing to export text or images from my pdfs. I 
understand that some people might still need their content to be separable, 
so I think adding the option to flatten your pdf is better than making it 
the default. Please address this issue this app is extremely helpful 
otherwise."

that I could import and export PDF's. Other programs had other features 
that I wanted, but did not need. For example, Squid did not zoom, but that 
really did not matter because I did not need it. Still others handled 
drawings better or had more robust file management, but these were usually 
coupled with intolerably slow Handwriting rendering. Squid had the features 
that I needed and worked fine at high resolution. I have used Squid as my 
Handwriting program for several months and I have grown to like it quite a

rather than a thumbnail & MOST OF ALL, (5) a textbox where can wrap text & 
adjust the size & shape of the entry. This problem with the textbox going 
off in one line ad infinitum is a fault at needs to be corrected.

2138,Lorenzo Rovati,"May 11, 2018",4," It isn't perfect, but it offers a lot of cool things, and with a few bucks

okay app until I upgraded to premium. It now allows me to take my quizzes,

over them. Couple this with a screen recording app, and I hope to greatly 
expand my reach as an educator (woe be unto my students). Also, couple this 
with a document scaning app, and now you can scan/import meeting handouts, 
add notes/write over them, and squid will save it as 1 file. It is a great 
way to actually digitize meeting notes and keep your office from getting 
over cluttered with handouts. As a note taking app, the writing reconition 
is very good (just set your s pen button to the eraser); however, I have 
not tried out using pressure sensitivity to adjust writing thickness."

the latency and made it feel exactly like writing on paper, only better. If 
you have a pixelbook, get the pen and then get this app. And by the way, 
the premium subscription is worth it just to be able to have stationary 
like engineering pads (which I use every day)."

much and i am sure that squid team will keep on latest and improved updates

2146,Erin Dunlap,"May 11, 2018",3," Love the options for page layouts and how similar it is to writing with pen 
to paper, but the fact I can't use the same account on multiple devices is 
having me look elsewhere. I write notes on my Chromebook then want the 
ability to view those notes on my Android."
2147,Yoshi,"May 8, 2018",5," One of the best in whole lot. Very good and simple design and work 
flawlessly on my tab s3. Only issue is that there is no sync option between 
devices and we need this for sure like if I need to sync between my tab and 
note devices or with my chrome laptop etc. Rest is great"
2148,A Google user,"April 30, 2018",5," An incredible app. It is very quick and stable. Even at ""infinite pages"" it 
maintains a fast load. I just wish there was a sync function like a sign-in 
to a personal account so that when using other devices the notes are 
available. Besides that I am very satisfied!"
2149,Chris Allen,"June 3, 2018",3," Great for taking handwritten notes, but convoluted syncing and no Google 
Drive support hobble this otherwise useful app. If they added multi device 
syncing and more 'one tap' controls on tablets this would be a must have."
2150,Brandon Ray,"June 4, 2018",5," I use this as a teacher on a Samsung Chromebook Plus with an S-Pen. It 
works great for what I need it for, and it is lag free which puts it ahead

this would easily be a 5-star resource. Please add this feature!!!"

tool."

Stylus works extremely well (though performance sometimes dips when CPU is throttled due to heat, e.g. during some charging).    PDF functionality does need a bit of refinement:  1) It would be nice to have ways to scroll between pages without pressing the (rather small) arrow buttons in the UI.        2) Import/export functionality currently flattens annotations and destroys ToC/bookmark functionality. I'd *really* like to be able to move between the Squid app and my desktop PDF app without losing the ability to navigate between chapters/bookmarks, and it would be nice too to be able to manipulate the markup I generate in Squid on the desktop (and to preserve annotations made on the desktop such as post-it style comments)         3) The automatic PDF cloud export is better in theory than practice -- if you change a Squid note's name, you'll have to manually go in and delete the old PDF, and export attempts fail far too often (ditto database backups)."
2161,Alexander Corbitt,"April 18, 2018",5," I love this app with my Chromebook! I use it for general note taking and

HOWEVER, developers, it's been a very long time already since u first came out, it's time u add these feature already: Please, augment the pen selection - now there is only 1 pen style. Most every other similar app has that. The color match feature is so critical that you're missing. The writing needs to be smoother as well. Right now it is very choppy, perhaps because it is vector based. Also, subfolder/directory ability, to be able to organize better.   02/14/18  Update I think it's time you integrate these critical things I've asked for for months. We're paying for this app you know, and I can't remember when you had the last meaningful upgraded. I still think it's a great app but next time I write a review I'm am going to give this app a 2-star rating and will definitely stop paying for it if there is no improvement as there are other apps out there now compete very well with this"

First is a rotate feature for objects/text written and drawn. Kinda essential to a note taking app in my opinion. The second is a magnifying/grouping feature that gives a more natural feel to handwriting for people who write big like myself.

Other than those missing features, it's a great app that I use almost daily."
2310,Lucas Bateman,"February 8, 2018",5, A great app for note taking especially if your notes are in pdf. $10 a year is more than fair for the level of organization this app allows. Handwriting looks a little off but that is my only complaint.

( hexagon, Pentagon, all direction arrow) 3. Table feature with column and row. 4. Add video file with supportive extension. (it can make notes more alive)  Finding some bugs like: 1. When i do zoom in, i could not write on exact location, mean that if i try to write after zoom in, stroke is delievered at different place.  2. Every time zoom in and out working with slight delay which is annoying.  Overall experience is best. Thank you Squid. üòÄ"

And I must say, the writing experience is the closest thing to actually using pencil/pen on paper of a number of popular apps I tested; even better then Samsung's own S Note. The Squid app, which used to be called Papyrus, has near zero latency when writing or drawing. And when comparing Squid to other apps such as Autodesk SketchBook and Wacom's Bamboo Paper on my Note 4, Squid wins hands down. The latency in the other apps is very noticeable, when coming from a Squid writing/drawing session. I use a Staedtler Noris Digital Samsung Pencil, which is sold on Amazon for $19.99."

I'm pretty sure my classmates are all really grateful that I can easily turn my notes into a pdf that I can email to them too.  Lots of customization in how the pen works (I've found that 0.3 without pressure sensitivity works best for me).  I love the zoom feature.  It's really nice when you want to write small notes about something but you don't want to take up a whole line. I paid the few extra bucks for the ""premium"" upgrade, which if I remember correctly included the highlighter option, which is quite nice as well.  The premium package also has a bunch of other page templates like graph paper and stuff which I'll probably never use, but I'm sure would be super handy for someone else.  Honestly, I think my only complaints is that the highlighter doesn't look right... but that could just be that I haven't played around with the settings enough.  I've also had a couple crashes, but I've never lost anything and it's pretty rare and doesn't even take long to restart the app. I definitely recommend this app if you have a tablet with a stylus.  EDIT:  I can't believe I forgot to mention my absolute favorite feature!  THE UNDO BUTTON! I use it so often that I've actually found myself reaching for it when I make a mistake on actual paper!  The eraser is really nice too because it can get rid of an entire penstroke at once (though you can swap so that it only erases what you want too).  And I use the lasso tool a ton when I want to move things around, or copy and paste diagrams and stuff.  Honestly, I love how clean I can make my notes with this app (and how easy it is to do so)!"

It worked very well with my Samsung Chromebook Pro as an Android app. My handwriting wasn't what I hoped it would be, and I struggle with the keyboard on the back of the Pro, but I think it would improve with use of the app. Unfortunately, the author wants a monthly ongoing fee for the app, or you use the ""basic"" edition. This would be a great $4 or even $5 app - but they want $1/mo or $10/year. In its basic form, there are other great apps that do as well, if not better, and are also free. The free version is fine, but again, so are others that have features this one charges for.

2336,Roslyn Sanby,"March 13, 2018",5, I love the way this app allows me to make notes on pdfs and saves it even when I'm offline. One suggestion I have is to have scrollable pdf pages - ie: not have to click arrows to go to the next page but rather scroll from one page to the next.

I use this for marking up landscape drawings with edits for the drafting team. I also use it for responding to questions from contractors. In this, it works well - it's very well synced with dropbox, Google Drive, and any other way you like to share. A few simple problems, however, are VERY frustrating. 1. From my experience and research, you cannot erase part of highlighted areas (which I used frequently). It is an all or nothing delete. 2.  With no confirmation for closing a file, I sometimes bump the back button and the file closes. Auto saving keeps me from losing the file, but I also lose the option for undoing. Not huge, but definitely frustrating. Add a confirmation screen for exiting and the problem is gone. More to come..."

A really nice feature is the ability to import a pdf, sign it with my S-Pen, and export it as a flattened version suitable for sharing.  No more need for those silly signing apps, none of which ever did that great of a job."

My professor lectures a million miles an hour so this has been a savior! Also, there are tons of awesome layouts to help organize or personalize anything! Would only suggest a little more ability to organize folders & how things are put in them. Maybe a ""folder within a folder"" feature to separate different aspects of the subject."

2477,Reece Eagle,"December 1, 2017",3," Decent app. My only complaint would be that you can not create your own backgrounds. For teaching, it would be great if I could set lesson plan templates as my background."
2478,A Google user,"December 3, 2017",4," I love this app. Use it all the time, i'd give it 5 stars but the color of the app is ugly. We should be able to change the theme of the app. Picky yes but appearance does count.   I still love still app and still waiting on a color change! Please? I'm begging for color option for this app!"
2479,Ank Raj,"November 16, 2017",5, It is quite literally why I still own an Android Samsung Galaxy Note Pro. The only question is when are you guys planning to make a version for Windows 10. I'm sure that people will go crazy over the likes of HP Spectre 360 and other similar 2 in 1 Convertible Laptops.
2480,Rowan,"January 18, 2018",5," Wish I could give 4.5... great for now taking, however I wish I didn't have to go to a different app to type notes. If you could integrate a basic type box for when hand writing just doesn't cut it,  it would be great.  And maybe flow chart tools????"
2481,A Google user,"November 13, 2017",4," Hands down the best writing and note taking app that I have come across on android. Use it with active pen on Samsung note tablet and it works great for my daily lecture and homework needs as a college student. Only thing missing is the ability to type. Otherwise, nearly perfect!"

It'd be great if i could embed a web link and create video icon when pasting youtube link that i could just tab snd heading to web browser right away."
2484,Ryan M,"November 13, 2017",5, Best note taking app for the S-pen. Allows you to completely ignore touch. Vector based with smooth inking. Keeps things simple. Missing sync. That is my only complaint.
2485,Jeremiah Glover,"December 3, 2017",5," This app is fantastic. It has multiple paper templates, excellent palm rejection if you have a stylus, and importing PDFs is a breeze with the premium subscription.   Worth it."
2486,Wuttimak .J,"December 8, 2017",4, Please approve. When i need to type on the paper. It is not easy to set the line up. Please do not make the pop up for type. Just give us to type on paper directly. The othe is very good for now.
2487,A Google user,"November 14, 2017",4," Using with my new Pixelbook.  It's certainly the best app available, but not perfect.  The tools in the UI should be quicker to access and get rid of the drop down menu.  The drop down adds significantly more time to switching tools."
2488,Joe Nance,"October 30, 2017",5, Very powerful tool. A tablet is incomplete and ineffective  without  it.
2489,Matt Hummel,"November 20, 2017",5," I pay for the features when it was papyrus, pay for the subscription when it's now squid. It's not really worth the cost unless you take a lot of notes or do a lot of pdf edits."
2490,Brandon Steed,"December 6, 2017",2, No multi-device sync. No direct Google Drive backup option. (Box and Dropbox native support only... Really?) Palm recognition is abysmal. Has a Pen only mode you'll have to use to avoid screwing up drawings so it's at least got that over OneNote.

2512,Rob Moore,"January 16, 2018",5, Absolutely perfect UI. If you'd asked me what exact UX I wanted from a simple note-taking app I couldn't have told you before using this. Great job.

However I would like some features added. The first feature would be to have folders within the note books. For example have a circuits note book and some folders in there, one for class notes, one for homework, and one for practice. This would greatly enhance the app and would definitely make it 5/5.  Another feature that I would love to see is to have a ""night mode"" where the background is black and the lines in the paper white so it's easier to write and not shed too much light in the room if it's during a presentation with the lights turned off.  Another feature I would love to see would be top add different backgrounds. Finally I would love to have the option to add pages in a pdf, not just at the end but between pages so I can take more explicit notes.  All this features would make this app be on top for a long time.  However, even without them this app is amazing."

It's a very powerful vector drawing tool, with an extremely simple but powerful interface. If you have some text you've hand-written, you can then go and select parts of it, then change the size, or the color, or the brush stroke thickness, or even duplicate it several times then slightly modify each one, rather than having to write something from scratch several times.   And since it's vector-based rather than rasterised, there's no quality loss to writing/drawing something at one size, and then later resizing it, or dragging it around the place, etc. <3  Basically, it's a really fantastic app. I'm very happy that I stumbled upon it however many years ago when I first got a tablet with a built-in stylus, and it has served me well ever since.    Probably the one feature that it's """"""missing"""""" (and I say that in the sense that I have absolutely no expectation of it being a feature) would be being able to choose custom typefaces / write with a monospaced font (and beyond that, being able to write syntax-highlighted code....) -- it's a very specific use-case :)"

However this app could use some minor tweeks to make it comparable to platforms like evernote.  If the creators of squid do not intend to make this app to wholesome, by updating the app to add features such as typing word documents and organizational tools like sub-folders. Squid should expect that users will want to  combine their notes with the other material on a platform that provides these details. The app does allow for exporting or backing up documents using drop-box or box, but there is no easy way to quickly upload to other platforms like onedrive or the google cloud.   This app is great if you're just trying to jot down some stuff on a touchscreen device. However if you intend to use it as your primary tool for school or work, the app needs some help before it can provide as a good platform for all of your work."

Unlike most apps, this requires a subscription to use different backgrounds, as though that were some great feature. The question is, unlike play store apps, I don't know that my subscription can be used across devices and OS upgrades and changes. I had a subscription at one time, but that disappeared when I reset my phone. What's the problem with using the play store normally, offering an upgrade, and let me use it on my devices. After all, we're just talking about extra backgrounds."

There is no latency in regards to pen input. The pen chooser is quick and intuitive, but there is room for improvement. I purchased all the premium features and among them my favorites are the highlighter and PDF import. Premium paper patterns are only available as a subscription service. The cloud backup (also premium) implements Dropbox or Box as the backup service, which works fairly well as a backup tool. However, I would like a cloud sync feature (like Dropbox on the PC or like Google Drive) so that my notes automatically sync across devices. Right now, it works more like a backup service then a sync service even though it uses Dropbox. Your changes on one device will not sync to the other device, you have to do this manually by restoring from a backup and saving a backup."

If the following could be fixed, it would be one of the best apps on the Play Store:  1 - Please add continuous scroll for PDFs, like in Adobe Reader / Foxit.  2 - If you add continuous scroll, please allow PDFs to still be editable in continuous scroll! 3 - Please allow default widths to be applicable to imported pdfs, whether in portrait or landscape; it's a huge pain to have to continuously zoom in or out for every page of a document I'm reading / scrolling through.  4 - Please enable full screen with no toolbar up top; maybe a single finger tap could call up or hide the toolbar, like in many other apps? 5 - please enable inverted dark theme for text / white background! For example, if I'm reading and annotating a screenplay, especially at night or on an AMOLED display, it would be great to be able to make the white PDF background black.

I think it is definitely a developing app, with a lot of room for improvement, but most people would find it useful and user friendly.  A couple freatures I would like to see is the ability to have notebooks within notebooks (for better note storage) and a close-up mode similar to snote or inkredible (I like taking notes on letter sized paper, which is a little frustrating with this app.  The infinite page works well though).

2842,Timothy Boudwin,"May 22, 2017",4, I love this app.  It's very easy to quickly draw in scale and easy to share the notes and sketches by email.  I do with that there was a way to rotate the drawings.

2913,Thomas Regan,"April 7, 2017",5, I use it on my Galaxy Note and find them an excellent combination. I looked for a zoom feature where a page I zoomed opened at same zoom settings and it was added. Developers listen to users feedback and act on it quickly which is great to see. Simply the best

I use Squid for technical DIY concept drawings and features I mention would make the app a lot better for this purpose. Selection is also imprecise at times - it's really hard to select a line even when you zoom in very close - several taps are necessary. Oh and automatic synchronization/backup across multiple devices is badly needed."
2922,Ray Haigh,"March 21, 2017",4," As this is a subscription service you would expect significant upgrades each year to compensate for the premium price being charged. On some things, as pointed out by many people, there is real room for improvement. A good app with potential."

This is a bloody note taking app, let me just buy the damn thing.  Edit: Versioning lets the user pay for the app on their own terms and when they want to pay. If you keep designing a great product, people will keep buying newer versions. It's essentially the same thing as a subscription, just much less aggravating. It's just another bill to pay this way, and since you deal with bills as a developer you can respect not giving people another bill."

In the past I gave this app a 5 star review saying all it needed was a writing input zone (something I know many many other users would agree with). I am extremely disappointed to see it still hasn't been added as a feature, especially as users have been requesting it for such a long time. It would make writing in this app much much much easier. Something like what lecture notes and notability have in this regards would go a long way. Also having endless scrolling for your pages (again like lecture notes and notability) rather than having to press between pages would be nice as well as it would be quicker to check past lines of works when doing long equations and such. Add these two features (preferably as one time pay features seeing as they feel like key features to every other good writing app) and this review would instantly be changed to five stars."
2986,Leah Lifton,"February 20, 2017",3," Disappointed in how many features require a subscription... Even the highlighter pen tool.

Highlighting can't lock into a straight line, text entry/annotation is clumsy, changing between colours is time consuming. Not at all practical for the amount of annotating I need to do on my documents. I honestly can't understand how making a decent pdf annotator is so hard. Cancelling my subscription. Am close to giving up on finding a decent pdf annotator for Android. The developers of this app should check out GoodNotes for ipad, which I would give a solid four stars."

2989,A Google user,"February 20, 2017",4, Very good app. I use it as my note taking book at university with the Samsung tab A6. It only could improve if it had tools like drawing 2D/3D axes for math and other things that simplify our lives as students -- not just squares and circles .
2990,Matthew Funk,"February 15, 2017",5, Dropbox backup works well now! the new pdf import style is nice. What would be nice is having a page spacing tool like one note. As well as a auto correct shape tool like one note as well. All in all a very useful app!
2991,A Google user,"February 14, 2017",5, I use this app for taking notes at University. It is the perfect app and I love how everything looks. I use it with my spen and I love the fact that I can erase with my finger instead of switching to eraser everytime. Please keep up the good work.
2992,Adam Staubitz,"February 19, 2017",4, Pretty awesome note taking/sketching app. l just wish it synced across devices and you could change the orientation of PDF's and then it would be perfect.
2993,Joshua Chen,"March 4, 2017",3, It triggers wifi everytime I launch the app. May be the only problem of the app but if you fix this (and probably add a cloud saving feature) it's going to be the best note-taking app ever.

If anybody finds this to be in bad taste, I will change it to a 5 star to reflect my actual opinion of the app. First a quick review. This app is fantastic. I use it for taking notes in university. I use it to jot down video game ideas. I use it to doodle when I'm not paying attention to a lecture.  The free version is everything you need to take sufficient notes although I've payed for a few tools to enhance the experience; well worth it. If i had ONE wish, it would be that notes would have tags and be searchable by the tags so that we could search for notes by the content. Titles just aren't enough for me to remember everything the notes contain.   Adding compatibility with multi-window on galaxy tablets would be awesome too so that I could read a pdf textbook and take notes simultaneously. Anyway, thanks for saving me from wasting paper and pencils and erasers. Keep up the good work."

In fact the last couple times it crashed , it then immediately asked me to rate it. Ironic? Second , it can't sync. So if you have it on your phone and your tablet you can't update notes across the two. It does have a backup function to Dropbox which is at least some comfort. Third , I wish it integrated better with Windows so I could edit and better work with my notes from my laptop. Otherwise , it's simple and personal. I originally looked at lecture notes , but it was way too complicated for what I was looking for. For simple handwriting notes and PDFs. It's great. I highly recommend it to corporate trainers , because you can put all your lesson materials in it and you don't have to lug around a big program binder."

It's like having a legal pad in front of you on my Galaxy Note Pro units. If you have a stylus on your tablet you need squid.

Also when you first start the app all the thumbnails are visible instead of the last folder you are in.

Been using the Premium (though NON subscription) version of this app for about 8 months now.  It's generally been great!  The only things that have been a little tedious is that the Cloud based sync using Box can be a little on the slow side when you have an increasing number of files .   Also when you have a large ongoing (""infinity"") sized document, strolling can be a little on the slower side as the document when fully sized & takes a few moments to get reconfigured / repopulate with each swipe. With the kind of docs I create, that can delay things when editing & looking for a section.  Some people have expressed concern about the subscription model being 'enforced' on them. Personally I don't have a problem with developers going subscription & would have upgraded to it if it offered more features than simply a few paper styles that I didn't really have a need for or if I didn't already purchase all the Premium add ons.  But as I purchased all the Premium add ons separately last year (which I believe is / was still an option now ), I didn't yet see the value in going subscription. Time will tell if this changes."

Plus, what happened to the ability to insert pages before/after? I'm not sure the direction it's headed will bring on new customers...  Previous review: I use this app every day to take class notes. It's everything i could ask for. The online forums are a good tool to provide feedback and it's nice to see where the developers plan on taking things. I'd love to see the ability to reorder pages in the future, but from what i can gather that is already in the works. Would also love the ability to backup to Google Drive instead of dropbox, and select tools straight from the ribbon instead of having to go into a dropdown list. Great job, love this app!"

It's pretty good for a ""toy"" app, but nowhere near as capable as Lecture Notes. No problem... I like to support independent developers, and thought the app had potential. But now the developers have gotten greedy, and have moved to a subscription model (for both new and existing customers)  to lock you into paying their living expenses from year to year. In fact they've posted a long article online trying to rationalize their feeling of entitlement... It reminds me of McDonalds workers who complain that they can't raise a family on the salary they're being paid.  Save yourself the coin and frustration and just buy Lecture Notes.

Updates are intuitive and frequent. However, they charge for features that should have been included in the free version for basic functionality. I bought the extra features, like eraser, geometry tools, and pdf import/export, before they brought in subscription (they let me keep it). These things are amazing and a huge step in the right dir from OneNote (which is abs trash, but I digress) but are overpriced by being priced in the first place. These devs are doing so much right.   I appreciate what you guys do but you can do it even better.  Edit: just read their article and I can see why they brought in subscription. It's ok guys. I know you really want to work on making it better all the time. I'm just not going to pay for a subscription ever cuz student Oh and my opinion about a lot of this has changed after seeing the price. I will consider getting premium if they add amazing features"
3622,George Pycik,"March 1, 2016",1,"You're ruining it I don't like being teased with new features that unnecessarily must be purchased through subscription.

If that and the cloud backup feature are solved, I would give 5 stars.  Used to love it.  But the premium features that I paid for no longer work.  The cloud backup service stopped working over a year ago.  The automated response from the devs is ""We're very busy, but thanks for writing"".  I've gotten two regarding this issue.  Then, the pdf import - the best part of the program - stopped working and hasn't worked for weeks now.  I got another automated response stating how overworked their devs are.  Granted I've only spend $8 on these features, they now render all my previous work with this program moot as the replacement program I must now find will be incompatible with my history.  Try the program for free, but I wouldn't pay for any of the added features."
3627,George,"February 23, 2016",3,"Very expensive I like the app and would've bought it, but it's too expensive. And this new subscription model is nonsense. Just make it ‚Ç¨1.99 for all features unlocked."
3628,Scott Simpson,"February 28, 2016",1,5 to 1 this is not a service! Subscription fees for a note taking app are a joke when you only update the app with new features once every few months. Actually provide a service before trying to charge like one!

The feature that Squid has that no other note app has is the most amazing pressure sensitive writing! It blows many art apps out of the water. A joy to use. As a note app it falls in with S Note, Bamboo and Keep except that I wish Squid had Keep's reminders and maybe a brush and shader from Bamboo. Reminders though are the main missing thing for me (except sync between mobile and desktop version.) You can star notes and categorize them, import photos, mark up pdfs. I wish more features came free but at least the purchases are one-time. This app is also awesome on a Surface."

I really liked the idea of being able to write with my finger on a tablet, as I have a condition that makes gripping a pencil very difficult. However, Papyrus randomly closes the note I'm working on and returns to the home screen without saving my work. I lose work, sometimes a lot. An auto-save feature would be nice, so the note would save itself every certain number of minutes. They should fix this random closing issue. It's making me want to find another notetaking program.  Also, when .pdfs are exported, small objects like periods get lost in the process. When working on math problems, decimals are always omitted during .pdf export."

It seems that in Edit Mode, there is no ""tool"" for scrolling pages (ie. when zoomed with my tablet in landscape orientation)?  So it seems that I have to switch back and forth every time I want to make a mark and then scroll to another page (yeah, I see the prev/next page arrows, but I want to scroll while zoomed, tablet in landscape with keyboard).

A must for any Samsung Note device.  PDF support is a great addition.  The option to turn on/off the pressure sensitivity for Samsung S-Pen is helpful if you find the pressure sensitivity of the Note 5 an issue.  I was able to take a few pictures of products on my Note 5, bring the pictures into a note then draw a few comments on the pictures and type / write some additional comments, PDF the entire note and email (or text it) to a few people.  It may not have the organizational abilities of OneNote or Evernote, but it writes smoothly on Note devices and you can incorporate pictures and PDFs into an endless paper where you cannot do this as easily in other apps."

Unfortunately, the automatic backup and pdf functions (""premium"" features for which I have paid) no longer work once you have accumulated a decent number of notes. Several fixes to this problem have been suggested by users on the Squid feedback website - such as incremental backups - but there is no indication of a plan to implement any solution.  So, if you just want to use it for a few doodles, it's great. But if you actually want something that you can count on, look somewhere else until they fix this issue.

I use it to keep charts to manage my diabetes, for notes at client locations and for lists. I have two of the three paid plugins and wow, they are great.  The thing is, there is no way to duplicate documents. In other words, no Save As feature, and this is a killer. I do hope they add it soon. Another thing that is really needed is access to the same docs over multiple devices. I understand this second feature is a lot to ask for, but sometimes I have one device but not the other and not being able to get at my stuff harshes my app buzz. I will definitely recommend this to others. If you have a tablet with a pen, this is the app you've been waiting for."

I like Squid better then the in-built S-Note. (If you are using Note 8, you can download the improve S-Note).   Other handwritting Apps each have their strenghts and weaknesses, but for me Squid  stands out from the best. I    hope they do improve the software. For instance, I like INKredible which wins out on the smoothness of its handwritting and the background template.       Wishlist:   1. Page template e.,g. Diary Template (similar to INKredible)  2. Ability to copy from Samsung clipboard (ie. to select from web site and paste)  3. Smooth handwritting  4. Tool Pallette easily available rather then going into a sub-menu. 5. I choose the A4 papersize. However, when you zoom-in-out. It changes  your choose papersize from A4 to infinite, which is very naughty. 6. I can't insert a page before page one. 8. Everything I add a new page, I have to keep changing the page setting e.g. size to A4 and blank page. Why can't it default to what I want?. 9. Add image, give you lots of ways to add an image, but wish there was a dedicated 'add image from camera'."

Sometimes you just want to write something down quickly without navigating through multiple screens, logging into an account or generating a unique format document like a checklist. Squid is perfect when you need paper and don't have any but you have your smart phone. Its interface is sexy and highly intuitive. I've been looking for something like this for a while. Papyrus came close but it wasn't as sleek and the pages were hard to keep sized correctly. This redesign, complete with the coolest logo ever, make me smile. I hope Squid doesn't try to compete with other note apps by adding more and more distracting features over time. This app is worth way more than it's premium package price in its current state."

Love the touch sensitivity built into the stylus of the note. Differentiating stylus input from finger input is so great. I can draw with the stylus, and if needed, zoom in with my fingers, draw a marquee around an object it with my finger to select it, and then scale, copy, move or delete with no tool chagning. I bought all the add-on's after the free trial period without even hesitating. They're all  extremely useful. Although, to be fair, a little expensive. In most cases, it's easy to manipulate images from other apps through sharing and/or opening into squid/papyrus.    The Bad: Editing text... aweful. Some bugginess on the widgets loosing their names in a folder for shortcuts and infinite screen size creates issues where the screen stops recognizing finger inputs at the system level, not application level. The backup features NEEDS to be able to use the same file on multiple devices.   I would replace this with notibility if I could for the improved text, backup, and cloud features."

4013,Anam Baloch,"September 22, 2015",4,A few new features Can you add a magnifier like in iOS notability  app so we don't have to zoom in and out to write on the pages. Also a hand tool would be nice so you can scroll with one finger. And scrolling up and down  instead of sideways on imported documents and PDFs would do wonders.

It did the job it was supposed to. It wasn't perfect- the toolbar is really crampt and you can't edit page order- but it did it's job. Recently, this app has been screwing up. It keeps crashing and when I open the note again all of it's contents are deleted. This has now happened 3 times, but because I've invested so much money in the in app purchases (which are overpriced considering they're standard features in similar apps) I feel like I have to keep using it. Hopefully they fix everything and make it worth my money, but since nothing (besides the name) has changed in the two years I've been using it, I highly doubt it."

4380,Luke,"June 1, 2015",5,Awesome Great app! Just need to work on the back up function. It gives me an error when I try to back up or export my notes
4381,A Google user,"April 18, 2015",4,"Good App Its a great app, I prefer it instead of S-Note, It would be great if it hat a better text tool with auto-wrap and a hand formula recognizer like the S-Note."
4382,Rafa≈Ç Miko≈Çajczak,"May 13, 2015",5,"Awesome, my favourite now! Beats all the samsung stock apps. Simple note taking as it should be. Love the finger-erasing feature, so easy and natural."
4383,Nasser Darwish,"June 14, 2015",5,Almost as good as it seems If this isn't as good as Xournal is probably due to these type of touchscreens. But on Android tablets I think that this is the best choice.

4385,Luigi Tiburzi,"July 4, 2015",4,"Excellent The app is excellent in writing and reading, it treats the pdf in a perfect way and is definitely worth the price. The only minor thing to be added is the possibility to scroll pages when editing PDFs. By the way, great piece of software!"
4386,Sheila R.,"May 17, 2015",5,Very Big Help - and so Easy After many tries with other apps I finally found one I can keep on home screen and in a second write down a phone number or name.

The best part is being able to assign a name to my note quickly for easy reference later. My preferences are still set when it is opened - now waiting for it to work with Android Wear - any chance of that coming soon?
4387,Alexander Perel,"May 6, 2015",3,"Not bad at all... With improvement potential Using the app daily, very efficient albeit not the cheapest. Suggestions: increase hierarchy like OneNote  (notebook/section/note), auto-wrap-selection,  page preview/scroll in multi - pages notes. Otherwise great!"
4388,Bonnie Johnson,"June 20, 2015",5,"You make me feel like dancing! This app is why I purchased the Samsung Note 4. I am a visual learner. I work with children who cannot yet read or speak. Together we draw out our plan using this app. It is great to be on the same page with them, literally."
4389,Chris Ong,"April 6, 2015",4,"Great app Flexible, does a good job of making notes.  Not liking much the back up option though."
4390,Claude Joseph,"May 5, 2015",5,"Best app for pdf annotations Used to use notability on iPad, this is even better with differentiation between finger and s-pen on a samsung."
4391,Andres Perez,"April 13, 2015",4,"Great note-taking app Best application I have used for taking notes so far, though it could use a few more features for organizing notes within the app. Also adding an option to delete or add pages in between other pages, and an option to add margins would be great."
4392,Brian Scott,"June 24, 2015",5,Just the thing for a quick note. Use it all the time for post codes shopping list and anything else I need to remember but don't  need to keep long term. Great
4393,Jason N,"July 3, 2015",2,"Cannot redeem purchases Bought the tool where you can edit pdf documents, after factory resetting my tablet I was not able to redeem my purchases so it feels like I just threw my money down the drain"
4394,Mark Ruff,"June 11, 2015",4," A page count for multi-page notes and ability to jump between pages would be helpful for larger pdfs. Also, if the zoom lock could apply to all pages it would sa ve time. Otherwise a fantastic app for note taking, especially over pdfs!"
4395,Anthony Bowyer,"May 19, 2015",5,Great App I use Papyrus with my portable printer because I can output a note as a png file. This gives better print quality than Snote which is my favourite note taking app. But Papyrus comes a very close second and works well with the Spen.
4396,Kevin Rooney,"April 10, 2015",5,"Elegant, Simple & Fun to Use Simulates writing on real paper while also providing Some nice amenities such as backup and PDF markup. The infinite paper and high detail graphics make you feel unlimited . Overall a great app"

4403,Chris Deligan,"May 19, 2015",4,"Suggestions The app if fantastic!!! It will make it incredible, If we can modify the text box. I mean, when you write text you cannot modify the box thus the text is static and you have insert new lines if you want to fix the text in the document."
4404,Juan Flores,"April 27, 2015",4,"Very nice app, but... Very nice app, works great with the galaxy note 10.1 tablet and the spen.   Though, for the backup locations, should add Google Drive as an option. I just bought the backup option, not expensive, but not worth it to me if the Google Drive is not an option. I gave it 4 start because of this."

4406,Michael Ramsey,"June 23, 2015",4,Arrrrrgh! Please add the ability to pin a note to the home screen. Users have been asking for this for years. This feature would allow Papyrus to be the perfect replacement app for S-Note/Action Memo. GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT! PLEASE!!!
4407,lukman hakim,"June 16, 2015",1," actually I love it, but It should added a ""search"" file function, its is very difficult to find note/file that I'm looking for, please add search function and I will give 5 stars"

4412,Mark Jacobs,"June 21, 2015",5,Great Note App I like this app because it makes note taking very easy.  I have separate note books and can add pages as needed.   I think this would be great for speech note cards.   Using it on a galaxy note 4.

Unlike S note, the pdf feature correctly imports all LaTeX math correctly (dropping minus signs and Greek letters at random is not acceptable!). I'm also very impressed with the handwriting -- it looks smooth and accurately reflects my paper-and-pencil handwriting. The Dropbox integration ensures I have access to all of my notes on every device. I tested several note-taking programs before choosing Papyrus and found I always missed the ""finger swipe to erase"" function.  I will happily pay for the pdf and Dropbox features when my free trial is over.  This app is excellent!"
4530,Blou White,"March 4, 2015",5,"Love it Since I am loving this app I do recommend it to others. Since Nov. 11- 2014 I am really happy with this app. I look forward to the day when they also add audio recording and palm rejection in future updates. For those of you who want to know, this app works perfectly on Samsung Note 2 and Note Pro"

I'm studying Electrical Engineering and keyboards can't replicate our work. So it's either paper or this app! Papyrus is extremely intuitive and doesn't distract you from the material, yet it has every required feature for great note taking. S note's inferface is horrible compared to how fluid papyrus is. It's worth paying for the features because they're doing an amazing job changing how people take notes. Welcome to the future."
4532,Andreas Kristiansen,"March 21, 2015",5,Easy to use Great app! Very intuitive and easy to use and has most basic functions you need. It's a little pricey for the extra functions though.

If I want ""Fit width"" on page 18, the setting should stay there on page 19.  Second, using two fingers allows you to move around a page, which is great. It would be even better, if you could swipe to the next page too, rather than having to press a button to do that.  Other than that, the app is really excellent. Adding these features would make it perfect, in my view."

However, there is an issue with the responsiveness of the touchscreen that occurs intermittently on my tablet, where it will stop recognizing my finger when I try to erase strokes. I have dealt with this by turning off and back on the display, which will fix the problem for a while. I have also noticed that the S Pen will occasionally write things about a centimeter away from the point where the pen is applied on-screen. I'm not sure if these problems are due to my tablet or the application, but other than that, this app is highly recommendable.   One suggestion for future development could be to include a feature where automatic syncing to the cloud is done only to files that have been updated/ written on since the last synchronization (instead of uploading all files to the cloud each time)."

Couple suggestions: (1) I wish the tool picker were permanently expandable so I could switch tools with one tap instead of two or three. This would be very helpful for quick notetaking in lecture settings. (2) I also wish two finger double taps were customizable so that, instead of zooming, it could toggle between the pen and the eraser or something along those lines. Customization is good, but not yet at 100%, even with premium features."

What could be improved?  It needs an easier way to zoom the pages, like a default zoom level you can select for the document. Also, the default edit setting shouldn't be a writing tool. I should have to select when I want a screen press to write something. Default should be one-finger moves the page. It needs a quick page select feature at the bottom of the screen as well as a little indicator telling me I'm on page x of xx. Lastly, an intelligent highlight assist is needed - other apps sense the line of text and keep you on it, while Papyrus essentially has a draw function requiring impeccable accuracy to highlight."

The infinite page size (which I'm still almost infinitely less than using completely) let's me not stop mid thought to add a page or move text over. The lasso (copy/paste) tool is scarily good at moving only what I want (gets entire shapes/letters without bordering shapes/letters or cutting in half), and for resizing. I'm assuming it uses vectors but whatever it is makes resizing selections stay just as clear and sharp. And unlike other apps it doesn't have any pause between drawing and seeing it on the screen. I used lecture notes before this and loved it except for the speed (even using all the tweaks the author suggested). And I didn't know infinite page size was a possibility. The only thing I can think of wanting is more shapes, like an arrow. But that's easy to just draw and copy/paste."

I love being able to sign pdfs and email them without having to print/sign/scan, or add picture of signature manually.  All in all, the perfect compliment to the Samsung Note Tablets.  *Using 12.2 Pro myself after Note 3 was too small for real note taking*"

I can't get it to make a note without the words being massive across the screen - trying to make notes on the lines is impossible, coz it just makes dots instead of the intended letters. Deleted!"

This app lost me hundreds of dollars, and, except for my keenness of mind, could have ended in the death of myself. I used this app for mission-critical, real-time note-taking for medication and dosage management, since it was the only one with support for the stylus on the Note 3 and skeumorphic paper. The app glitched and deleted three days worth of notes (which are lists of numbers for me, including times and dosages), and replaced them with no warning with notes from three days ago. If I had trusted the app and not had the intuition that 'these numbers are wrong', harm could have resulted. LESSON: NEVER USE NON-CERTIFIED 'CONSUMER'-GRADE TRASH FOR MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.  Negative ten, and the first review I have ever posted -- and ever intend to. I've never had an app that nearly let me die before. It's like a anaesthesia timer that counts two minutes per minute."

I have talked numerous people into downloading it, and they all love it for notes. However I am very reluctant to shell out over $10.00 for the extras. I really don't know why there are three separate updates. I'm no business major but it seems logical that if you made a ""pro"" version, bundled all the updates into one, and cut it down in price to say...$1.99-$3.99 you would get a LOT more purchases, and in the long run... $$$   Or at least have a trial to where we can try out the updates so we know if it's worth all that money. Thanks for the basic part of it. Please consider all the ones who are begging for more affordable updates. Do that and it's 5 stars all the way. You're close, you're so close....                                                          Update!   11/29/14 I love how this had a sale on the upgrades. I purchased a couple of them when they did. The only one I haven't is cloud storage because I don't need it. Also they added a trial period which is great! I use this app all the time and couldn't be without it.

Nothing offers such a well design app for note taking. This is the only one left installed. Operation is learnt in about 5 mins.  No nonsense design means you can open new or add to existing organised notes or notebooks with very few selections.  I'm using it in the context of an IT support department so I need to get going in the time it takes to pick the phone up and say 'hello'.  Writing tools are easily changable as you go with 'extras' little more than the cost of a similar paper notepad. Editing facilities are excellent with erasing / box drag select sections.  When done notes can be sent to the cloud in a couple of taps to access from anywhere to whoever selected.
4990,Jeff Hutcheson,"October 25, 2014",4,Closest thing to Notability I love Notability on the iPad. This is the closest app I have found to it. It needs a few more things to measure up but it is a very good app. Probably the best Android note taking and pdf annotating app I have found.

I particularly like the ability to import pictures or clips of the contract documents which I mark up and send to subcontractors.  It improves my productivity as well as keeps me organized.    Like many of the other reviews, the only con I see is that you can't insert pages into PDF files.  My work-around on this is that I leave a little extra room on my meeting minutes so I can jot down notes during the meetings."

Image adding is very useful, especially with the embedded crop and resize.  However, it would be perfect if the pictures could be moved or resized as well after pasting it.

Some other apps (like INKredible) have a text box set in the lower part of the screen where you write in a higher zoom and it updates the real ""sheet"" in normal scale.

5236,A Google user,"September 15, 2014",5,Best handwriting more app I absolutely love this app with my Galaxy Note 10.1. By far the best app for taking hand written notes. The cloud backup to Dropbox and pdf annotation are also a life saver for me. Definitely need a proper wacom stylus to take full advantage of the software.
5237,Mansoor Anwar,"September 7, 2014",1,Dubious How dare this app assume the role of default app for opening pdfs and then throw up an in app purchase for that functionality.  It clearly seems that you are trying to trick users into purchasing.
5238,Valeriy Beketov,"September 24, 2014",5," Work perfect for me. But it would be cool, if you can sort pages inside book (change their order, copy/cut them to another book, etc)."
5239,Glen Solomon,"September 14, 2014",4,Great Product I like everything about this product except the file management.   I would recommend it and will struggle with the FM until they improve it.
5240,Jonnathan Nascimento,"September 8, 2014",4,"It's OK Very nice alternative to s notes. But it needs to be more adsjutable. Less clicks more development. And why the pan screen gets transparent when moving the page? If they fix it, this app will be perfect for me."
5241,BJ Reeder,"September 24, 2014",1,"No cloud sync Love the note taking capability and s pen integration but without cloud sync I'll look elsewhere.  If they add that and the ability to delete a page and reorder pages, I'm their customer for life."
5242,Jim bison,"September 7, 2014",5,"The beat goes on!! This is one of the best App's for very Quick notes it looks like a 3x5 card, for out side sales its the best. I like better then S. Note. Thank you for this free App."
5243,Christian Bolliger,"September 18, 2014",4,"Very good - folders? It's a very good app. Since i discovered papyrus i didn't use SNote anymore. But the opportunity to make folders would be very very usefull. So please, implement this! After that, the app would be perfect :)"

5249,Omar Nada,"September 16, 2014",4,Pretty good app It will be better if there was palm recognition and a better version to ease typing instead of moving the page every time the screen is full(good notes has that feature)
5250,Nick Pontrelli,"September 4, 2014",5,"Just like writing on paper. If you have a Galaxy S5 (or any phone that had increased touch sensitivity), turn on the Increase Touch Sensitivity and you can use a regular lead #2 pencil and write on the screen as if you were writing on paper."

I''ve found S Note to be pretty annoying because the pages are ridiculously small and I would have to have countless pages just for one lecture of notes. Whereas, with infinite scrolling, I can keep on going uninterrupted, or I can add another page if the topic changes or if I just feel that it's getting too long.  This would be 5 stars if the S pen wrote more smoothly on the app. It writes well enough, but for someone who is OCD it gets rather irritating. Could this please be fixed? The S pen, writes amazingly well on the S Note application, but it feels a bit jerky on this application."

I'm in college and use lecturenotes because the custom tools and ability to save pens makes taking notes in class a breeze. It also lacks the ability lecture has with organization (keywords, indexing, and search) it's almost there, but needs some fine tuning. A really good app though and I did pay for all the additional features. If you need a basic note taking app and don't require a lot of extras or intense organization this is the one for you.

5344,Jose Rovira,"September 1, 2014",4,Awesome app for school note taking. This app is awesome for taking notes with the spen on the note 10.1. I just wish the premium features hadn't been so expensive. But they do work beautifully. Needs to sync across devices for 5 stars.
5345,Allen Randall,"August 9, 2014",5,Papyrus Great app for note taking. Page control is a little awkward but notebooks are very useful
5346,Rick Gilliland,"July 22, 2014",5,"One of the best! This is one of my most used apps!  The one feature I would love to see is the ability to snap to the background grid and finer control over that grid.  Otherwise, three thumbs up!"
5347,Luv Mysemi,"July 22, 2014",2,Was OK til trial expired Won't let me do anything now so Uninstalling since I can get better notes for free.
5348,Krzysztof Jr. Franek,"August 29, 2014",5,Great note taking I use it every day on my galaxy note for work and private topics. The option to edit and move lines flexibly makes a great improvement compared to traditional note taking with pen and paper.
5349,Angel Harrell,"August 15, 2014",5,"Perfect for signing stuff Well if you have a stylus. But it helped me ditch the print, scan, fax routine. Especially for documents that don't accept Adobe signatures"
5350,David Bermeo,"August 13, 2014",5,"Excellent app! Purchased the tools and pdf import add ons and it became my only note taking app for school. Although pdf import should allow to create new page, this is the best way of taking notes! !"
5351,Brent,"July 29, 2014",5,"The best There's really nothing else like it. I use it to import PDF blueprints and mark them up for changes, or highlighting, etc. Great for contractors!!"
5352,Becca Kae,"August 14, 2014",5,"I use it for jotting down quick notes... and lists. Works great! I use the stylus that's built into my phone to write, and then my finger tip to erase... slick! :D"

5356,Paula Sarkis,"August 4, 2014",4,Great app It is a great app. I use it to take notes on pdf files. However I would like to request an update. It would be awesome if you can include an option to add a page into my imported pdf. Sometimes the notes won't fit in 1 page. It would be nice to add 1 page.
5357,Miranda Shuba,"September 3, 2014",1,No good It wont let me write anything! Uninstalling!

5362,A Google user,"July 25, 2014",3,"It's ok This app is ok but the reason I'm uninstalling is because it is to difficult to erase notes, I mean you can hit the undo button but that only removes one letter at a time. When you want to remove the entire note at once it's like a three steps process"
5363,Iqbal Ahmed,"September 4, 2014",5,Very gud app. Found it better than note. Very easy n extremely responsive. Also eraser is brilliant
5364,Erkan Doƒüantimur,"August 29, 2014",4,"Great but.. I would to be able to type the text and see it in the page directly, instead of typing it in a box and then getting it into the document."
5365,Isabel K,"September 1, 2014",5, This app is very handy and good to take notes on. The writing is perfect for note taking and the opinion to change the colour is good for identifying different things.
5366,Gareth Buxton,"August 12, 2014",5, Papyrus is what Samsung should have provided with the galaxy note phone/tablets .  It's quick and easy to use and allows backups to dropbox/box.
5367,Wang Jim,"August 11, 2014",3,"Video voice are needed Would give four star if the app has posted or calender function, five stars if voice, video, and location can be inserted"

Gets really clunky when you need to switch regularly. * No scroll by swiping, and no continuous page display  * Page navigation is done by either hitting the forward or back key , or pressing the page number and spinning through all the pages - takes forever on a large document  * Phone app freezes on large PDFs  *Zoom level doesn't hold when you change pages  * Pasting text from other apps doesn't wrap the text - just sticks it in as one long line Lecturenotes has a bigger learning curve but provides all of this and lots more, so I've adopted that as may primary note taking app."

A nice clean, uncluttered interface and good, useful functionality. One of the things that is important to me is the ability to easily annotate PDFs. Papyrus is the way to go--it does cost extra for that and several other tools I want, but for the ability to do something I really need to do it is well worth it. I didn't think I would use the 'add-image' function, but it turns out to be very handy and again easy to use. Thanks."
5486,Nand Patel,"June 7, 2014",5,"Better than all the others Even though you have to buy some add one, this app is the best. I can import and EXPORT in pdf format. So no proprietary export be like the others. This is better than snote in the sense that it won't screw up the import of pdf and make it unreadable."

5488,Kingka ji,"June 9, 2014",5,"Very nice I'm a artist and I find not only is it a good note app but sketch app as well,  I would love to see a painter app from you. Also simplicity of the interface makes it better in terms of sketchbook pro interface"
5489,Obi Jawn,"June 22, 2014",2,7in It feels clunky on the 7inch screen and makes it hard to use. Probably a good app on a bigger screen
5490,Nicodemos Damianou,"June 21, 2014",4,Needs one thing One thing missing to go on 5 stars: Auto scroll page when reaching the edge. Otherwise it gets too disruptive.
5491,David Mejia,"June 9, 2014",4,"Feels natural Just downloaded it. I need a stylus but so far I am very impressed with the design and layout. It reminds me of an app Google would make, and that's a good thing."
5492,Abhilash Kavuru,"June 15, 2014",4,"Really good but needs a few more features really great interface and paper design. Best PDF writer on market right now. also love the organization.

To be clear, I use a Galaxy Note 10.1 - and with that form factor in mind (i.e., an active pen), it's fantastic for note taking.  It also works very well as an ebook - provided you load them in as PDFs.  It could use some features to round out its usability - but I mean this in the sense of MS Office needing improvements, not NeoOffice - that is to say: the tool is complete as is and very good, but obviously it's not perfect.  If you're looking for an all-purpose handwriting app, I HIGHLY recommend getting it."
5495,freeforall tousez,"July 18, 2014",4,"good app but minor bug and missing feature zooming out a lot then drawing somewhere on the bottom left only end up with a very big pdf (size, not space wise), and there no direct way to export to local storage (sd), i end up having to exporting to dropbox then export to sd from there"
5496,Bill Anderson,"July 3, 2014",5,"Papyrus has them all beat! Greate app! I use it every day in meetings to take notes, less disruptive than typing.  I do wish you could search handwritten notes for specific words, like SNote."

5498,Jim Douthwright,"June 16, 2014",5,Love it Best note taking app I have used.  All notes are backed up on dropbox as a back up file and as a pdf file.  Easy to organize notes in different files.

5500,Marthinus Bosman,"July 17, 2014",4,"Great but too slow This is the best handwritten note-taking app I could find, but even with a stylus, it's still too slow to actually use for in-class note-taking, unfortunately."
5501,David Contreni,"July 4, 2014",3,"Unfortunately, not for a Tegra Note 7 Update/mod to my original review.  The pressure sensing feature of the Tegra Note 7 is not supported.  Enabling pressure sensitivity requires enabling active pen which causes all sorts of trouble on the Tegra Note 7.  Too bad--I'd give it five stars if it worked."

5503,Siddhartha Goswami,"June 7, 2014",1,No palm rejection It is of no use without palm rejection. How can any note-taking app call itself note-taking without a palm rejection feature ?
5504,Kent D.,"June 8, 2014",4,Save the trees! Great tool for note taking.  I rarely use an actual note pad since I downloaded this app.
