Each time I have to search the account by name to be able view their videos, rather than if I were to simply click 'Following', which in reality has no real value on the app."
1,A Google user,"April 18, 2020",2, No improvement that I see. Still a very crappy app! I hate the new home page in the app! Give the user the ability to decide what is on the home page or what screen the app opens with! Stop forcing me to use an app the way you want!! Not a very good app. The app doesn't seem to be getting better!
2,Link Letter,"April 24, 2020",4, The app is better than viewing thr website from an internet browser as it seems the videos stream much better from the app. The only downside of the app presently is it doesn't connect to the messages service. But other than that its very good and stable.
3,Mike Swindler,"April 20, 2020",1," New updates? Ha. Why did you remove the possibility of casting to devices other than Chromecast?! It was dodgy, but still useful. I was hoping an update would fix or add features not remove existing ones!! Very disappointing."
4,Todd Schreiner,"April 16, 2020",1," It used to be a good app, but not it just crashes everytime I open it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and it still crashes when I try to log in. Not good. Better using the web browser."
5,Daniel Brinkman,"April 24, 2020",5," High quality, artistic, and creative content. Most importantly, the lack of invasive ads. I hope more people can support this platform and put their content on here!"
6,Paul Bushe,"April 16, 2020",2, Still can't purchase movies through the app. Needs a massive upgrade in that area. Also vimeo needs to get onto platforms like PlayStation and Xbox. Also a search button would be useful.
7,Gregory Chan,"April 5, 2020",5," Easy to use. My account was frozen (automated flag) and someone cleared it within 24 hours. Very easy to use and publish to other sites (YouTube).

My account was frozen (automated flag) and someone cleared it within 24 hours. Very easy to use and publish to other sites (YouTube). No ads on the video. Simple interface to tweak settings for the video (thumbnails, other details on the player). Using this to publish church sermons. Using NCH video editing software to edit and creat .mp4 file."
8,Rares Serban,"April 19, 2020",1," Support email is fake: ""... like you sent a direct email to an address we are not actively monitoring..."" No way to contact for bugs or issues. Shame on you!"

I find this incredibly destructive to my organised way of working."
10,Coke Horner,"April 19, 2020",5, Vimeo is extremely reliable and efficient and is a powerful tool that can be used to reach millions of viewers. I am absolutely satisfied using this app!
11,Ethan Concepcion,"April 10, 2020",1, One of the worst apps for streaming. I only use because it's where my courses materials are. There's no way to minimize videos or just play sound.

There's no way to minimize videos or just play sound. No fast forward or rewind other than manually clicking and hoping it's a good spot. I don't even understand why they made this app with so many other competitors successfully implementing better features
12,Adrian Pinnock,"April 21, 2020",4, I use Vimeo to upload the videos we host on our work website. It's been a great experience for the last 4 months no draw backs to the mobile app. What is there is easy to use and accessible.
13,Shrirang Deshmukh,"April 22, 2020",5, The filter seems to be a bit of an issue. For example if I search for allo allo then I wont get any.
14,John F. Hampton Jr.,"February 15, 2020",5," I love the app as far as being able to keep up with videos let my friends put out.

I do however hate the fact that it will not use picture and picture and show on top of other apps in the app permissions. This is a blatant shortcoming of the app. That's why I gave it four stars instead of five. I am editing my review to give the app five stars. Previously, I could only see two lines of any comment or replies to comments and now it is showing the full comment, So I'm giving it five stars."
15,Audrea Lott,"March 4, 2020",2," Good quality videos, but really challenging to navigate the app; if I exit a video it goes all the way to the beginning of the list and I have search and work my way back to the video.

There's no ""continue watching"" feature. Watched videos don't show up in my history. My feed has unwanted material, suggestions, staff picks that outnumber items from accts I'm following. Would love to be able to set up a playlist and determine what order videos will be played, especially when watching series."

You look at a video in Chrome, go to use the active Chromecast symbol, get a message to download the Vimeo app to cast via Chromcast. Guess what, the cast won't go past the Vimeo splash screen. Won't play. But you're spyware recognised without asking both my *and all the other* gmail accounts on logged in devices. For prospective users - beware. For the Devs, not worry I one star - misleading spyware"
17,RobertPayne556,"April 18, 2020",5," The amounts of upload video space should be increased, and longer videos should be supported, other than that however the app is excellent."
18,Paul Shenkyr,"April 26, 2020",1," No background audio play. This is a standard feature on YouTube, Twitch, etc. Will update review when app does"
19,Jeff B,"March 2, 2020",2, The app and service are good in concept but the execution isn't that great.

The standard play/pause buttons (such as on bluetooth headphones) don't work with the app. The time indicator at the bottom of the screen is cut off on the bottom right. It's difficult to multi-task and I'm always worried I'll lose my progress if moving to a different app. Also used Vimeo for a password protected livestream from my workplace and the stream would either stop or prompt me for the password every few minutes. I typically avoid Vimeo when I can but some Patreon creators use it.
20,Sameer Qumsiyeh,"April 18, 2020",3, Why the app doesn't have the same Analytics features as the website? Please give us the ability to see detailed analytics.

It look like your account has been disabled due to a violation of Vimeo's term of service"" why? I haven't done anything yet."
25,S. Willis,"April 19, 2020",5, I give Vimeo a great rating. This app never fail to deliver a numerous of great content. Allows you never to miss an important message from the work place.
26,M F,"March 26, 2020",1, Horrible UX. everything is spread out everywhere so even when I am following a specific channel I can't find all of my purchases or figure out how to make new ones. it's like there's 20 different steps you have to do for any little thing you want to do it's not just in one place.

I use this website an app to follow only one channel and yet I can never find anything. I've even had purchases lost all together! If it wasn't for this one channel I would never use this app.
27,Romeo Portillo,"April 21, 2020",1," Will not let me cancel subscription! Been trying for days now, and I've tried everything"
28,Bagha Shams,"April 20, 2020",1," What's the point of this app? It can't play even Vimeo videos! When I try to open a video in a website to this app, it says to open it back in the browser. Seriously, what's the point of this app?"
29,qhawe luthuli,"April 23, 2020",5," Great content, very arty and edgy creative stuff available and in really good quality. I enjoy it loads."

35,Eisa Mahussain,"April 16, 2020",2, Casting doesn't work well at all. Adding videos with password from a link to your watch later and then casting it also doesn't work well/at all.
36,Christy L.,"March 29, 2020",3," I had a little trouble activating the Vimeo app on my Roku. That's why I I took away 2 stars, if I hadn't experienced that difficulty I would have given 5 stars! Please make it easier to activate the app on Roku."
37,Sylar Brackins,"April 6, 2020",5, So far it's great this isn't related but I would like to know if anymore Hyperdimension Neptunia has been released in America yet asides from the first season I'm using speech to text so that's why there might be mistakes in this I don't know though.
38,Agustina C,"February 29, 2020",2," It's a good video playing app, but you can't just play something in the back ground. You can't access on demand videos, which is the only reason I downloaded the app anyway. You still have to use the browser for access to on demand content"
39,TheComicChild,"April 26, 2020",5, Very fun to use. Lots of tools to figureout.
40,Nam Ki,"April 14, 2020",3," During live a lot of time I am not able to chat. It's so frustrating, no matter how much I log in- log out..."
41,Angel Troncoso Garcia,"March 31, 2020",3, Needs picture-in-picture to allow multi-tasking usage like other video apps. Notification controls should be more robust and granular. In general this is a functional app that is missing useful features.
42,Tommy Schnoor,"April 17, 2020",1, Why can't I cast to my Roku TV? I have a Vimeo account and my Roku TV is activated my account.
43,RavencLOEY,"February 6, 2020",2," Why can't I view the subtitles when I'm using the app? It's only available when I watched with my browser. Online and offline videos on the app won't show me the subtitles, please help me fix this issue ASAP, thank you"

I do not care about my own profile! I am not creating my own content! I want recommendations, history, a superior watch later system, and a list of people im subscribed to, not uplaoad, people subscribed to me, and a horrible search system. I want to see a service that can replace YouTube; right now, Vimeo is not it."
50,Angela Martin,"April 4, 2020",5, Vimeo is easy to use. The quality is excellent. Sometimes searching takes a little longer to find exactly what I'm looking for but it isn't that bad. I do recommend this app.
51,Rudraksh Pathak,"March 14, 2020",3, Why is there no option to easily control video quality? A good app for watching videos. The content selection is what makes it different from YouTube. The data rate while watching videos is a bit high.
52,Don H,"March 18, 2020",1, Can't cast video's that are password protected? I can watch the videos in the app but can't view them on my tv. Also the controls are gone when you're casting other videos and looking for a follow up video. Not intuitive and messy content.
53,Christian Bara,"April 7, 2020",4, The search result automatically goes back to the top after pressing back button which is annoying. Please fix this issue.
54,Jameel Siddiq,"April 17, 2020",5, Installed for a video purchase but have since watched free content as well. The download option for offline viewing is a good plus.
55,Levirries,"February 17, 2020",3," I love the interface design and overall useability, but I have two gripes presently. One, the search indexing is a bit slow; two, I can't zoom in on some cinemascope videos on my 18:9 phone."
56,Danielle Rice,"February 7, 2020",5," Horrific... Nothing would stream or play, paying $288.00 yearlg for a totally useless app. Tried to unsubscribe, as to get refunded and you cannot unsubscribe once you apply for thr free trial, your paid in full. I give this app and its services -5 stars."
57,Sherab Rabzyor Yolmo,"February 18, 2020",3," It's all good, but I wish the controls were the same as YouTube. Also, if there was a way to share our videos on Instagram stories that would be great."

60,Greg Gory,"February 29, 2020",2, The interface of this app has needed a lot of work for quite a while now. I mainly use it out of necessity for various Patreon accounts I am a patron of.
61,Kimberley Platt,"March 24, 2020",5," The features and benefits that I am very fond of is the ease of use of the app and my activity on a wide variety of devices (phone, computer and television streaming device)."
62,"Paul Sybrandy, MBA","April 13, 2020",4, Love the app. Wish there was a PIP option like YouTube but perhaps in the future. Adding that future would definitely change my four stars to five stars.

65,Hans Neervoort,"February 29, 2020",2," Chromecast fails very often. It'll show the logo on the TV, say it's connected and playing, but the video doesn't show. Also, autoplay doesn't work."
66,harry appiah,"February 28, 2020",5," It's a nice app, except that downloaded videos cannot be stored on local storage. Try to include that feature in subsequent updates. Thumbs up."
67,Ryan Harris,"March 14, 2020",2," Content is great but the app is poor, it doesn't do everything the website version can do meaning it is basically pointless. The UI is fiddly and frustrating to use."
68,Karma Gunz,"April 11, 2020",3," Good app but could be improved in so many ways. No fast forward keys, dark theme. Buggy app and the buffering time is crazy."
69,Danny Bobrer,"March 2, 2020",5, Enjoy winter seasons I really enjoyed that I'm starting to get at the ripe age and I noticed that a lot of these things are happening to me thank you for the scriptures the help me to understand I knew they was there I just didn't put them together that way thank you brother
70,AnnaArendelle Lover21,"March 3, 2020",4," A MUCH less restrictive version of YouTube Things like Miniplayer are missing. Otherwise, I HIGHLY reccomend giving this one a shot if you'd like to watch things online like I do."
71,Rajib Kumar,"April 5, 2020",3, In YouTube we can make several playlists according to our need. But here user can't make any playlists to save videos which is a big inconvenience.

82,Paul Smith,"February 24, 2020",1, Just doesn't respond or load videos. Actually for me Vimeo is a poor performer everywhere. Most times I never get to see the video.
83,Caleb Morrell,"March 16, 2020",3," Video quality is amazing, but app design and layout is confusing and not intuitive. Could probably use a redesign."

97,Кирилл Костенков,"March 7, 2020",1, Insta app displayed that I can screencast video in full version of the app. Unfortunately full app can't do it because video has link-only access.

There is no functionality to disable seeing ""Vimeo Staff Picks"" from your feed.  If you're the type of person who is signing up merely to watch one or two channels, be prepared to have to slog through a wasteland of picks you have no interest in, but Vimeo has determined you most definitely MUST SEE.  By forcing consumers to scroll through videos that Vimeo deems worthy, they are trying to control your visual experience and narrative.  No one cares that these videos are hand selected by ""humans"".  Let the viewer control their experience, and that includes electing to opt in or opt out of Staff Picks.  Until that changes, I do not recommend Vimeo to other users.  In fact, I would actively encourage users away from the platform.  When you can't control what you see, then rest assured someone else is trying to control you."

What happened was that I was flagged by adding the link to the original source of music that was used in my video. In editing mode, I copied and pasted the link in the discription box. Beside it, it says that, quote on quote, ""but links are ok"". I did this because I do not want to be plagiarizing the music used in my video. But the automated system flagged it as a spam. I don't use Vimeo and would rather prefer YouTube instead, but we needed to use Vimeo in order to embedded on to Behance. And on Behance is where we post our assignments for our Intro to Digital Media and Digial Films courses (that I am currently taking). But with my Vimeo account locked and unable to post any videos, I am surely to fall behind my fellow peers. I can make other accounts, but I am concerned that those account may get flagged as a ""spam"" as well. Anyways, onto the actual review 3 star rating: This type of media platform is very similar to YouTube. So I'm giving this an okay rating because I do not have any past problems with this app/website. Easy to use. Easy to summit videos onto your Behance page. Why it is a 3 star rating: Unlike YouTube, this has an automatic report system, meaning, actual people do not report your video, but the bots do. This can work in some cases, but most do not. And another thing that I would like to mention is that they do NOT give you any WARNINGS. That is the biggest difference between YouTube and Vimeo. YouTube gives you 3 strikes for your behaviour and 3 more for the content of your channel. On Vimeo on the other hand, does not have this type of system. No warnings, no strikes, nothing. And you would have to wait for an ACTUAL person that works at Vimeo to mannually unflag your account. As of today, my account is currently under ""review"" and I have to wait 3 business days to get a message."

699,Mark Wood,"July 29, 2019",2, App is nice but seens to be one major flaw; when casting to chromecast it won't display captions. A major flaw if you want to watch videos in other languages. Would be 5 stars is they can fix this.
700,Deborah Hubbard,"November 13, 2019",5, So thankful for Video! Love using this and the ease of using as well. Thank you Video!!

719,Shawn Cushnie,"September 17, 2019",5," I love it right now! The app works, and I have nothing negative to say so far with my experience using the app and watching the videos and buying on demand content."

723,Keoki Johnston,"January 26, 2019",1," It's like YouTube but really really really really useless. content doesn't load (video links on patreon don't work) channels seem to not exist that should, the interface sucks, the app is just bad. just watch YouTube."

726,Hector A Diaz,"October 29, 2018",5, Its great. Only thing I would like to see added would be the ability to create video playlists. As is possible with YouTube.
727,Dino Brown,"November 6, 2018",3, I like Vimeo. However this mobile app needs to have the ability to switch the account to team accounts. Also the review page could use some work.
728,Iliana Moya,"October 16, 2018",5," When I first downloaded the app I taught it would be one more of does apps that give you stupid videos but man I taught wrong! It is super informative, weird and cool as hell! Call it two chains if you like cuz it's all at the same damn time!"
729,Carina Johnson,"April 28, 2019",5, so far I love this app. Not all crummy with adult content so my kids are allowed to have it (until that changes of course). Picture quality is amazing as well as sound. Great app

734,Marcella Cumberbatch,"June 8, 2019",5," I am SO HAPPY that Vimeo provides a place where we can post or find videos which otherwise we probably wouldn't be able to... AND, the fact that we can download videos FOR FREE to be able to watch with no internet/WiFi, is FANTASTIC😀"

I can't even get through the first screen where it wants all of your personal information. I dont want to give you my email, I dont want to give you my Facebook, I just want to watch quality content on your platform, and the app just freezes every time I try to skip the opening screen so it's entirely unusable. It makes me sad because the desktop version of the website is so good and is such a good competitor to YouTube, but the app won't even function from the get-go and the mobile set is almost literally unusable."

746,Margie Woodfield,"October 20, 2019",4, The main reason i prefer Vimeo is because i have been told that the captions/sub-titles are more accurate than you-tube especially when listening to podcasts from other cultures where the speaker has a strong accent

That was my education from 1945 Saturday morning to teenage where wolf etc and paid 15 dollars a week. But one day almost 65 Hollywood I avoided because mental illness would not survive the long hours and terrific high and sleepless excitment but i did actually teach myself to write grade 9 0r not and now funny writing is starting to be better at least give indicators to that effect but it took many years of putting up with failure.

If I could manage videos in more ways than changing titles and default privacy settings, the app would be remotely useful. As it is, it's pretty much worthless and you may as well just use the website in your browser. Vimeo, please... give us a way of robustly managing our videos on the go!!"

Now I can't see the videos in my feed as previously and now it's totally unintuitive to use.

Keep the MY FEED below RECENT VIDEOS in vertical scroll mode just like before.

one day because I had closed the application, everything is totally fine.

it is quite difficult to find interesting videos. The ones you see are 
mostly selected manually I think. The second one is that the Chromecast 
functionallity is more or less broken. It is almost impossible to watch 
three or more videos in a row without the Chromecast crashing."
5359,Cyb3r A1i3n,"July 18, 2018",4," Great content! Would rate five stars if there was a button that would let 
me select the video quality. Most of the time I'm getting resolutions lower 
than 720p when I can watch 1080p videos on other apps."

5363,Excel U,"July 21, 2018",4," This is a wonderful application, my only complaint is that you cannot chose 
your stream resolution on the app, when you can do so online on your mobile 
web browser?? What is this?? Otherwise amazing content as always!"
5364,Dovid Jubiler,"July 16, 2018",4," A good open platform for both posting and viewing. More relaxed policy than 
YouTube. Aimed at social networking, there's no real viewing history and 
lacks finer functions like 10 second navigation buttons. Over all, I've 
enjoyed this app."

Vimeo will not support you and you cannot upgrade to pro if needed. Even if you want to cancel the subscription to upgrade play store will not completely delete the subscription until it has end...Full ReviewDO NOT BUY THE SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE PLAY STORE!!!!!!!! IT IS NOT THE SAME AS THE VIMEO SUBSCRIPTION!! Vimeo will not support you and you cannot upgrade to pro if needed. Even if you want to cancel the subscription to upgrade play store will not completely delete the subscription until it has ended and your account will be stuck. Opening a completely new account will be the only option which if you are a business is NOT AN OPTION. Beware!

woodlanders)."

5911,Jeremiah Akers,"April 15, 2018",1," This app is complete trash. Trying to navigate to purchased videos is like 
trying catch raccoons in the nude using only your feet. It's even worse

YouTube needs to see a psychiatrist."
5912,A Google user,"April 27, 2018",5," There is no attempt to silence voices that don't line up exactly with the

5919,FIRST LAST,"July 23, 2018",4," Love it. Especially for Offline Watching WITHOUT paid membership, like

I wrote support, and they responded that they do not support this.  Why would you put it in the app if you know it doesn't work and you don't support it?

Well, this is not possible on Vimeo Android. How the heck am I supposed to find the correct spot on the playbar of a 3-hour doc on a 5-inch phone. It's ridiculous.  But correct me if I'm wrong. I visited the help page and there were only shortcut instructions for desktop users. When you spend money on a platform, you expect from it some basic features.

It doesn't have annoying youtubers and content less videos on it. It is a place WOR budding creators to spread their euphoric content. What sucjs about vimeo is there is no option in the app to adjust streaming quality. I want that back. Everyone does. There's no gain in removing it for the company or the users. We want that back.

There's no way to buy premium content from app, only reason I installed app is to view some rental video, also it doens't remember history.  No option to go forward like YouTube or prime video"

I can do this on a computer in higher resolution playback, so why block it on Android?? There's no history of what videos you watched or were watching and it loses where you are in a video half the time of you have to leave the app, so you have to start over and find your spot again where you left of. . . Also would be nice to have the ability to change playback speed, isn't that common on any other video playback app now?"
6626,jeff hafer,"January 7, 2018",1, Its 2018 and this is probably the only app that doesn't allow you to turn off autoplay.  Pathetic.  Refuse to go pro (subscription) until they hire pros to fix the app.

6836,Joseph,"December 14, 2017",5," When I think of Vimeo, I think of two things: Great, original content, and hardcore nudity. YouTube hates both! So Vimeo the real MVP"

When the video is hours long it is difficult to fastforward 1 minute or 2. But the app is great and its contents are great. 👍
6958,Zeynep Çelik,"November 20, 2017",3," Great app, there are always super interesting cinematic things to watch. The video quality, however, is really bad which makes the experience not as pleasant as it could be."

6964,Alice Blackwell,"November 29, 2017",3," This app would be a lot better if the user could browse and search without having to stop the video, and instead of having the 'up next' be from the search results, have the 'up next' be made up of similar videos"
6965,Nicholas Brooks,"November 24, 2017",1, YouTube is much better on this app there is no videos and the only good thing about this is you don't need YouTube red to make offline videos if there are good videos on this when I check back on this app I will rate this better.

It's really refreshing to see a lot unique videos not found much elsewhere. Vimeo has been around a bit for awhile, and I've found some real gems of art work, filmography, and beauty throughout the videos here - this segways into: I really hope the submission standards (which I will be honest don't know a whole lot about as I am more consumer status when it comes to video streaming) don't someday become so onerous as to push out non-mainstream artists. Please keep it so that quiet artists and shy brilliance can keep peeking out in the videos I find here. Thx for all the views :)"

7713,PVTY KERRY,"August 7, 2017",5, Vimeo is amazing because of how much freedom I get on it. Not trying to sell just create and vimeo allows me do it for passion and not money. I appreciate that. YouTube is necessary but it's trash
7714,Pankaj Bhoir,"August 15, 2017",2," It's very sad that despite being one of the best and unique website, you qre not able to convert that into app. And irony is that you are not working on user feedbacks."

7720,pete2 bec2,"August 18, 2017",5," Surprisingly good. I wasn't sure if would like it, but the content is excellent and the app is very nicely behaved. Smooth, instant, full screen and the sound on my stereo speakers is super clear."
7721,Devon Waldron,"August 28, 2017",4, Nice quality app for streaming video and exploring content on Vimeo.  Only real complaint is that casting video frequently causes the video to play back slowly or to be out of sync with the audio.

7729,Edmer Buen,"August 5, 2017",4," It would be nice if you guys can add a feature to sort the videos. Something like ""Most Watched, or ""Newest Videos"". Other than that this app has a great UX design."
7730,Nick Dahlen,"August 3, 2017",4," I love the app, it helps tremendously with remember songs or trading ideas. The only down side is the 500mb cap on free users. Start a YouTube channel it's free"
7731,A Google user,"August 15, 2017",3," I like it. The short problem here is that we need some payments. At least pay us when we get 500 followers. And at 50,000 can we get a Vimeo Award? Can it be physical though?"
7732,A Google user,"August 16, 2017",5, Don't know much or use much. What I do use works well thank you.

As a creator it allows direct payment for content which is great. However, Vimeo's phone application does a great disservice to this goal.   Poor buffering over chromecast, no ability to close your phone while playing a video. This and other issues discussed throughout this review section leave the consumer asking why do I use this platform? The app itself sadly lags behind competitors. Currently there is a shift towards increased consumption of content over mobile devises, faults with an app like those experienced here will eventually hurt the platforms bottom line."
7939,David Griffin,"July 11, 2017",4, Good platform. But it really needs the community aspect fixed. This is what made it better than YouTube... That and superior video quality. The only icky part is the slowness the files load and play.

Their only existence on this planet is to take what use to be free for 5 to 8 years and make a profit. Just like Vevo was invented solely for the purpose of putting ads on YouTube.

A tribute a reminder to NEVER FORGET about the men and women who have and still r fighting and dieing every day and see feel and face horrors that we can't even imagine. We need to always ALWAYS remember why we have the freedoms that we do and how we have been able to have them. Thank you Wes O'Donnell for reminding us and to NEVER FORGET or to just become complacent and take it for granted, but ALWAYS REMEMBER that it comes because of a tremendous and SELFLESS and way to oftentimes SACRIFICE.

8220,Katie Nunez,"May 10, 2017",4," Vimeo is becoming my go-to app for the videos in my life! Sleek, easy to use and the perfect place to showcase your creativity. The Android app offers no lag, super fast uploads and a great video management dashboard. With ❤️ from the Windy City."
8221,Lord of Ruin,"June 15, 2017",3," Currently the app does not include the ability to choose the thumbnail, which is annoying. Plus, when uploading a video, I would like to be able to decide which part of the video I'm interested in. We could do with a start and end slider. Anyway, other than this, all seems okay. Thanks."

The interface is vastly improved from the long standing original one but it would be nice to see some of the little conveniences of the YouTube app make an appearance in the vimeo app as it feels a bit clunky as of now.

Its quality over quantity, so if you're looking for inspiration from professional filmmakers and companies rather than amateur vloggers and lolcats try this (no offence, YouTube!). And unlike YT it allows you to save videos for offline play, saving you tonnes of mobile data usage!"
8458,Youtuber MOMO,"March 26, 2017",5, It's good for what I need but simple because downloaded videos can't able to move to the phone memory it's like YouTube that's the only thing I didn't like it please take my feedback as a request not as my order and be useful to others
8459,Puru,"March 29, 2017",5," I love Vimeo over YouTube just because of the quality of the content and the maturity of the community is much greater than the latter. No bullshit cat videos, only high quality content is available here. Also,NO ADS. If you want to make good use of your time , get this over YouTube."
8460,orlando l,"April 29, 2017",5, I love the site/app.  I'm a video editor so it works well for me to showcase my work. I  also get see what other folks are doing and keep up with current events.  So Vimeo works for me well.  It will work for you too!
8461,A Google user,"March 23, 2017",5, Offline videos and no need for profiles make Vimeo the finest video app on the market. Only lacking option is a proper dark theme.
8462,Kelvin Peralta,"March 9, 2017",4, App needs Visual improvements as well as performance improvements. Freezes when scrolling thru videos after a while. Lacks the ability to see other videos by Author like on iOS. Please make this app better.

8465,Amiruddin Adzhar,"March 22, 2017",3," Hi. I always like to save offline videos on my phone for videos that i like to watch again but everytime I restart my phone, i have to re-download those videos cause it went missing."
8466,Christopher Lew Kum Hoi,"March 27, 2017",4, Great app for any project! Easy to use but would love some more of the options available on the desktop site for the app (URL for private link and thumbnail)
8467,Edgar Bergadà,"May 2, 2017",5, Amazing and diverse content of awesome videos full of artistic talent of many levels and for so many different likes. Full of gems not so hidden but easy to spot anytime.

8469,TheMagician832,"April 3, 2017",5," I haven't had any trouble with Vimeo. When i needed help, which isn't often, they resolve the problem quickly. The videos are high quality in out put."
8470,Christopher Christian Sanchez,"June 3, 2017",4,Very Useful But... It is as good as Youtube but it eats up a lot of space. I hope this can be adjusted to lower picture definition so that it will be easier to load offline and use smaller space.
8471,Patrick Montgomery,"March 21, 2017",3, App is great but are you guys planning on adding Xbox One or PS4 console support? When I try to cast it says it will only cast to Google Cast... what up with that?
8472,Stefan Eduard,"April 15, 2017",3, How is a site that is all about Hd videos make an app that doesnt let you watch Hd. Or am I just blind and cant find the HD button?
8473,Rishab Chitroda,"April 9, 2017",1, It takes for ever to load videos. And keeps buffering. Tried it every time and the same result.  The content is so good but sadly the app doesn't do justice to it.
8474,Raven Joyce,"March 16, 2017",1, Bull crap. I've tried to watch several movies and nothing just the previews and a still screen of streaming nothing. A waste of time.
8475,Juan Rodriguez,"April 15, 2017",5, One of the last good video apps. A last view of how YouTube and various other video sites used to be. The quality regardless of pretentiousness is worth it.
8476,Sadaf Muskan,"March 10, 2017",5, I love you vimeo app........ this is the best app😙😙😙....... bcoz I don't upload my videos on YouTube😔😔 bcoz it copyright music😔but I'll upload all videos on vimeo😀😍❤
8477,Lucas Sebastian,"April 19, 2017",5," to time ago, there was vimeo app and it was just too bad, but now with this investee performance and design he is amazing. My congratulations to all involved. :)"
8478,Jason May,"May 6, 2017",1," It was working great, now I can't open a video. All I get is ""unable to load"" message"
8479,Victoria Thompson,"April 13, 2017",5, It's so outdated I can't watch any of the videos on my tablet. I have to use my computer.
