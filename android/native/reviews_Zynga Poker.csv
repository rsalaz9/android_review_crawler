Since I started depositing to get the extra features toy have to pay for, the game doesnt work properly if you dont deposit in a few days.

Every other hand is a straight and its designed to get you to buy more chips. They use bots to win when going all in with 10/7. What real player does that? Very disappointed. 4.29.2020 - Just wanting to say that this game is absolutely set up. I've played over 150,000 hands and when you can predict the next card, you know it's a sham. I'm so happy I sold my stock in Zynga. Even the admin only respond to the 5 star reviews. No wonder the company is struggling."

Higher the league lesser the fun in playing. I know there are option to report such behaviour. But it really annoys you at times. Makers needs to come up with some solution as to how to get rid of these malicious play.

But when you start playing regularly, you will start losing for sure and get less winning hands and lose money. You will play more to win but they won't give winning hands and you continue to lose. That's how they trick you into buying chips. I get only 2-3 max winning hands winning hands in a tournament. Never going to buy chips. Installing this rubbish now."

7,Berkeley Hall,"April 21, 2020",2, I think your analytics are screwed up. I've never seen more suited flops and trip flops than I ever have in 30 years of playing this game.

Sit at a table for 1.0 1.5 hrs and there be at least 4 split pots or more. So yeah your game ain't as hot as you think. I still play it. But overall 2.5 because of frustration from watching people win on impossible long odds of the trip flops or suited flops.

I have won a few real life tournaments and this pretty close to the casino. There are still a lot of bad players playing. The go all in because they don't know how to play but they normally don't win a tournament. I wish they had the massive 300 player tournaments but I love this app.

11,Ezra Anglo,"April 28, 2020",1," Your ads are annoying now, everytime I enter and leave a table, there is a 5 seconds app, even after spinning with ad, it gives me another ad. Its not like this before. I know its not much but im even a vip 1. I was thinking of topping up for this but this gives me seconds thoughts"
12,Jeremy Prunty,"April 22, 2020",1," I used to love playing this until people started readin my cards and see what i had before i played them. I am done playin this game. Until you have better defense against hackers and cheaters, i will never play this nor recommend it to anyone i care about or play real life poker with!!"

All in all a really good app"
15,mike budiansky,"April 27, 2020",1," The game freezes inexplicably. All is good until I go play a tournament. I can't make it a hand without it freezing. I've lost 2 tournaments without placing a bet (other than blinds). Unless you like frustration, don't waste your time or $ here."
16,Raquel Allen,"April 29, 2020",4, Sometimes I lose too much and sometimes I WIN BIG. The thrill of the ride. It would be great if I could search for a user by name or email or account ID to add them as a friend. Also referrals should automatically become friends.
17,Angel salerno,"April 28, 2020",5, Best poker game out there! But the transfering of chips is out of control... Also people are saying there are workers out there meaning people that work on this poker site are coming and taking chips...in other words it's fixed.. I sure hope not!!
18,christian Baker,"April 29, 2020",1," Rigged. If you're playing well, you'll get cards that're stacked. If you have a few poor hands and don't get a lucky bluff that results in a W, you'll lose 90%+ of hands until you stop playing for X amount of hours/possibly a day. Absolutely BS."
19,TrAnCe AdDiCt,"April 26, 2020",3, Some of my poker buddies seem to be able to play 25-50b blind tables yet mine only goes up to 10-20b why is this? Also it would be nice to add a chip banking feature to bank chips on the table after winning them so we dont lose them all.....
20,Destiny Rogers-Wihongi,"April 28, 2020",1, I no longer play and an contemplating whether our not I should uninstall. The game is terrible since adding pop up ads. You use to have a choice but now you're bombarded with the same ad every minute. Used to be such a good game.
21,Kool Klown,"April 28, 2020",1, Every time I get in all need one card and never get it but went ever other need they get it. Like just before I got QK and he had JJ i need Q or K for the win. The hand before hand the person had K 10 I had A9 the flop was 2 9 K and after the was an Ace The the last card was K
22,Dorlas Collett,"April 28, 2020",3, I like the game but the bonus spin u say if u buy you get more I paid and I like getting gold but I spend 50 and it barely gives you anything I was very upset and to advance you have to get a certain amount of wins I don't have time to play all day long sorry
23,Neeraj Doorgiah,"April 28, 2020",2, Hving problm in the game .....too much glitch....wen pressing on video to get 500000 it does not work well...it doesnot load the video...its basically videos of coin masters......plus spin n win never give higher bonus only double the bonus every time .

Once you buy chip from Zynga then they will remove watch video offer so you can not get 10mil free chips anymore. They give u free spin for every 3 hrs but it is not enough for player, so beaware. It doesnt matter how good u are u can not beat Zynga computer game, they can control you by push to buy chip again and again."
26,Jainil Mehta,"April 18, 2020",1," The game takes ages to connect and load, the hands are lagging and i am out of the game because of that. The new update has just screwed the gaming experience. 100% deleting it and switching to other app. Cannot give 0 stars"
27,drilon alimi,"April 28, 2020",5," I think its good game bot the past team its not fear, Zynga takes a lot of tax about our money, and its not fear because some profiles they dont take chance to win but to lose somowen can win with pair 22 and somen lost with AA"

29,John Lowe,"April 18, 2020",4, Game is okay but with any game like this you get too many premium hands which doesn't help when your opponents know this and tend to call you with anything.

If they are winning at that rate something is wrong. I was dealt the exact same hand 4 times , an algorithm problem. All of these online games are having similar problems but the bottom line is they are free except that eventually you will lose and want to buy more chips. This app is better than most. Make your own assessment after you play. Even live games are no bargain."
31,Nidhi Verma,"April 18, 2020",5, The game is good . But I am facing issues from last two days. I am from India and no one in my family can play on the app as it hangs throughout. It's basically not working. Kindly help

34,Samantha Rutter,"April 23, 2020",3, Would be better if you could actually win real money. And cards was shuffled between hands. To many times 2 or more players have had same hand
35,Marcia Nachreiner,"April 29, 2020",1, Not enjoying this game. You made chages that opened it up to a whole different culture of players. Bingos and bots and cheaters who are passing money to their friends by folding

The patterns of losing hands become as predictable as the true odds of pulling each hand. Which ruins the fun of the game... In the end...you're guaranteed to lose.....whatever hand you have.....and 90% chance it will be on the river.. As long as you don't want to win....or care about a fair chance to win...its fun.... For a little while. If their goal is to get you to spend real money...this is a MAJOR flaw.

51,David Mikhael Roque,"April 26, 2020",1," They put bots that will surely win. Not in all games but in a lot of it. They do this to make real players eventually lose chips and buy from them.

I notice there have been multiple times individual’s text in different Languages leaving others at the same table out. One advantage of playing at a table is the social environment.

Extremely frustrating to win to only have the computer take it when I leave the table. Now, after posting this review, I can no longer log into my account."

This game introduced me to Texas holdem which I find very fun. But one issue is the tipping bug which needs to be fixed (chips are not deducted when you tip the dealer).

188,Grant Thomas,"March 22, 2020",5, I think this game is really good it gets you to play with people world wide and you need to have a good thinking head on to think what you are going to do next I would really recommend this game but be careful if you are thinking of going gambling in real life don't want to waste all your money.

190,David Phillips,"March 28, 2020",3," It's a pretty decent game, and fun enough to waste some time through the day. I rate 3 stars because it seems like it makes you lose on the river an awful lot. If you want to waste time then get it."
191,irma shahini,"April 12, 2020",2, Hii. I found this game interesting but it's not allowing me to connect it with my Facebook profile giving the same display as: this content isn't available right now. Disappointed.
192,Markyboy Formilleza,"April 15, 2020",1, This is app game. Is very awful. You suspend account without reason. This is not recommended as many players are bots and your acct. Can be hacked easily. Players dont accept friends as they can manipulate your acct. Admin dont care when you report malicious things going on.
193,Free1 Leads,"April 16, 2020",1, Very sad Zinga Poker downgraded the graphics and made access to avatars even more difficult all before correcting serious software kinks. Over all serious fail in the attempt to evolve the game. Mean while zings still promoting hack play by gifting points for knocking players out. Very poor for.

199,Jeremy Petersen,"April 14, 2020",4," I wish the free spins had higher payouts, especially when using 50 Zynga coins. I have had very low payouts numerous times and feel it could be adjusted to have higher payouts when using your zynga coins."

204,Tai Theguy,"March 24, 2020",3," Game functions great. But odds are NOT random. Just look at ppls high hands vs hands played. Royals, quads, straight flushes are handed out like candy.

219,Hellrider 7s,"March 23, 2020",3, just one real request. would like to play this game in vertical mode. that will make it more intuitive and easier to play with one hand. it would also be better to have that as an option in the settings since some people might still prefer the landscape mode.

291,Isaac Almanza,"March 23, 2020",5, Awesome and addicting!! But sometimes frustrating when it doesn't pay out the true winner (a pair does not beat a full house) it's happened on a few occasions and I lost somewhat big.

297,Austin Bush,"March 22, 2020",3, Only thing missing is skill based matchmaking.. Randoms betting all in on the first hand of a tournament is a fine example of what i dont like to see.
298,Carol Meekins,"April 11, 2020",1, Tired of re-installing just to he able to play. Stop with the special play if you cant code it right!

Zynga, you should be ashamed of creating such an application where you cannot add a friend using their Zynga ID if you haven't logged in using Facebook. Does the ID make any sense at all then? Every single app allows Guest Users to add friends. You should have atleast provided an option to login using Google Play Games, but I guess your ego overweighs your sense of judgement. WORST APP EVER. GIVING 1 STAR BECAUSE I CAN'T GIVE 0."

312,nikhil tarkase,"April 17, 2020",5, Purchased chips for once. Now zynga has blocked all the adds from which i can earn chips. Wantedly giving bad beat so that i should purchase chips again. But i will never purchase it again.

339,Byron Begley,"March 29, 2020",4, Good game. However you really need to add the option to create a table where you can play with just your friends. This would make this game by far the best out there.

414,J Merritt,"March 19, 2020",5, Plenty of chips to get you started winning. Dont get to excited and move up to fast because the river will drown you. Take it easy & you can play for free all you want. And fold at least half your hands. Playing all the Q3 & J4 you are dealt will cost you.
415,A Google user,"April 18, 2020",3, Great game. Shame some of the features have stopped working despite me troubleshooting them

Are the stats they show as your winning % real..No they are not..challenged zynga to prove fair play..they could not meet the challenge.proof enough is the best hand gets beaten on the river 90% of the time..the more chips you have the chances of you winning go down..so dodgy

I started playing it once again, starting on December 22, 2019. While playing, I’ve been knocked out of winning hands many many times. I reported these incidents to Zynga. I was told by them, that they would investigate this matter, and get back to me. I was very confident that they would see what hands were actually manipulated by bots or hackers. Zynga informed me that they would investigate this matter and get back to me. I still haven’t heard any response back from Zynga of the results of that investigation. As of today, I’ve lost a total of $19,000.00 US dollars in two weeks playing this game. in addition to being knocked out of winning hands. While playing games where I knew I had the winning hand, when I attempted to to raise my bet by putting all my chips in the game, I would get knocked out of the entire game, and lose all those chips. This isn’t an isolated incident. It’s happen so many times, that I lost count. Then last night around 10:45pm, I purchased $500.00 worth of chips, I went in the high stakes poker room where I play. I was in that room for two hands, and made two small bets. After winning the last bet. I looked at my table chip count and it disappeared, as well as all the players from that room. Then I checked to see my chip reserve, and they were all gone. As said above. Every suspicious incident that I observed, I reported it to Zynga. I must of sent 50 incidents. And I have not received one response from Zynga for any of my complaints. All I get is an automated email that they will investigate the matter. I am not saying that I didn’t lose any of my chips. I didn’t lose my chips by bad beats or losing hands. I’m very observant of my chips, and my wins and losses. A majority of them were lost through cheating, using bots or hackers. This is unacceptable, how Zynga allows their players lose their chips by cheaters. And they do absolutely nothing about it. I don’t mind losing chips, if I legitimately lose the hand. But I don’t want to lose by bots, cheaters or hackers. I don’t understand how Zynga ignored everyone of my complaints. Are they just going to ignore that I lost $19,000 in A two week period, without doing an audit of my account to find out how most of my chips were stolen ? I am requesting to speak with Zyngas fraud department, or a manager. Do you think it’s fair that I got scammed on Zynga, and I should just forget it? Is that how Zynga operates because there a large corporation, and they just don’t care how they make their revenue? That’s not only immoral, it’s also totally unethical. It’s also possibly a crime, if they are aware that hackers and bots are cheating their players, and Zynga is allowing it by not investigating players complaints. They have the technology to investigate these matters. EDIT: Zynga does absolutely nothing about bots, hackers, or other ways their customers are scammed. Actually when Zynga customers lose their chips by scammers. Zynga customers actually buy more chips from them, and that brings in tons of revenue for their corporation. So the the more bots, and scammers who are infested all the over the Zynga poker network, the better for their pockets. So All the BS that they promote about their customers safety, security, and how they are so concerned about their customers having a pleasant experience on Zynga are pure lies. ITS ALL ABOUT BRINGING IN MORE REVENUE FOR ZYNGA."

1264,lanita hollinhead,"January 24, 2020",1, Update: Emailed support 1-24-2020. It's says I've emailed an inactive address so it appears the address stated is not up to date. App won't open any longer so it's useless. Back to 5 star rating once I receive assistance to fix this issue.
1265,Jeffrey Mezeske,"February 10, 2020",1, Never ever buy anything on their app. Once you do you cannot watch an ad for free chips. It just disappears.
1266,Zeqa Demiri,"April 10, 2020",4," I think this game is so addicted, but worst lose sometime with two pairs, straight low..."
1267,A Google user,"February 14, 2020",5, pleasant players . Balanced Dealing! Good game Thank you. Got to treat me better. Stop beating with River card. Thank you.
1268,kingcuke,"February 24, 2020",4," Came with phone, ez 2 play, lots of bonuses & free chips allows one to play free. Emailed free chips no longer work, opens in Play Store. Minus a star for annoyance."
1269,John Inkenbrandt,"December 18, 2019",5," Pretty good for a free site. However there are a few more ads with the latest update. No complaints otherwise. The longer I play,thebetter I like it."
1270,Steve Southard,"January 14, 2020",1, Game is terribly unfair. I've been playing for several weeks and almost every time I have a good hand someone else has a better one (way over 90% of the time - no one is that unlucky).
1271,Hannah Fry,"February 13, 2020",5," Love the app but I can not get in to my account, I have two Facebook which I donot play, and another account same email of course with 180 million and cannot get in to it. Can you assist"
1272,Daniel Edmunds,"February 23, 2020",5, Hi I've seen a few people saying they have lost chips for no reason even if u win feels like u still lost I had same problem I contacted them and they said If u have strength meter on u lose 10% of all winnings surely if u no how to play u don't need it
1273,Kevin Montgomery,"February 5, 2020",3, I'd rate it higher if there weren't so many ads I had to wait out to be able to play.
1274,Heather Croke,"April 10, 2020",1, I cannot log into the game from Facebook
1275,Gavan Ericson,"March 8, 2020",1, Never had ads in it until now. Lost all playability if every time I want to change tables I gotta watch a damn ad.
1276,Johnson David,"March 24, 2020",1," Cheap chips means crazy betting. Not for serious players. Too many ads, site locks up, goes down or slow to load."
1277,Jim Thomas,"December 20, 2019",1," When you play, you can have a winning hand and they will award the pot to someone else! There are many times t Zynga awards equal hands or even a lower hand to your opponent, this is all in a way to lose your money & buy chips!!! I've never & will never reccomend the game to anyone!!!!"
1278,Sandra Shepherd,"January 4, 2020",4," My only issue with this game, it loves to knock me out during the most critical time. Just as i had an A high flush.... Bam, it quits on me and i get... Oops, And you know the rest"

1281,Rob O,"April 19, 2020",5," Such fun, tried 2 other poker apps and like this one the most!"
1282,GreyGrimlee,"February 20, 2020",4, I'd give it 5 stars but people with to much cash just sit at tables and just out bid everyone. If I may suggest limit how much money someone can sit on at the lower dollar tables. To many people sitting on 40m-60m on the 5k-10k tables
1283,XRP MO,"December 13, 2019",5," The best poker app out there there's no scheme to get you to buy chip if you lose all your chip it's very easy to get free chips 500,000 at a time the gameplay is smooth the only drawback I see is that there is no rush (fast fold) poker."
1284,Maree Teetee,"March 15, 2020",5, Awesome game and the social aspect too

Wish u guys would let us have better conversations without having to act on hand sooner. But all in al 2 thumbs up. I was wondering if u guys can let us see the amount that was in the pot even after it was paid to winner. Slot of times I wish I could remember how much I just lost or the other player just won but instead the game deals the next hand so quick (which I love but..) I find myself thinking of previous hand the the total cash that was at play... Thanks
1286,Susan Spoolstra,"January 9, 2020",5, I have been down loading this for a couple of days. It's been down loading for 2hrs today. I have been playing Zynga Poker for a very long time. Now I can't play. It's a very good game.
1287,Chetan Taunk,"January 16, 2020",3, I upgraded to the new version and lost all my previous tickets Gold and the money . Why is it so. Dont feel like playing it anymore. Can u pls give some clarification.
1288,Jennifer Baker,"January 28, 2020",1, Terrible. Played it once. Updated it and now it won't load. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Done! I can go play other poker games and have no problem. Don't waste your time with this one.
1289,Keith Miller,"March 19, 2020",5, I Love the game. I was a black diamond player on Myspace. Played mafia wars from the beginning followed it to Facebook to the end.
1290,Shayla Tracey's Random World,"February 25, 2020",4, Its anamazing game however my only issue is you cant search up friends instead you'd have to have played a game with that person to b friends other than that its an amazing game

1295,Tamya Hayward,"January 23, 2020",1," Rigged game, just pisses you off because its sets you up to lose if you don't spend real money. Don't bother unless you just want to be pissed off. Uninstalling until you all fix it."
1296,Leon Lovell,"February 2, 2020",1, There is better games out there. This game is hacked to the max try it for your self you will see they make you lose tney want you to buy chips that's why

They try to buy you out of chip hoping you get frustrated with folding and bet beyond your means. Then you might have quad tens but the crooks will have quad queens. How does that happen on a game bragging their cards are dealt out randomly?? Moreover why is Zynga pretending nothing is wrong,will not respond to people's email showing proof I believe. I have seen them,profiles opened to insane stats screenshots,..etc. Why indeed?"
1298,Phil Buckingham,"December 21, 2019",1, I use to love this but since the last upgrade it no longer plays . Very disappointed after spending money on it. If only there was an option for no star's
1299,Paul Rankin,"March 28, 2020",4, Good highs but bad lows.over the years I get spells were I get a good run then the plug is pulled and no matter how good my hand is I always get stuffed
1300,Spiros Koutelidas,"January 28, 2020",1, Pre drawn hands quite often lead to straight s and flushes or flushes and full houses in the same table. It happens once in ten hands which is ridiculus. No realism at all here and no random drawn cards. Useless.
1301,Vincent Thomas,"January 31, 2020",1, Can't play as guest. I just wanted to test this game without giving my Facebook information but there's no way to play as a guest even though the option is there. Terrible scam app and extremely disappointed.

1304,A Google user,"December 16, 2019",5, can you please make UNFRIEND settings from the previously accepted friends? Some of them are so annoying that whenever you are in the game they are inviting multiple times even they were rejected. It so disturbing when you are playing ..they keep popping out in the screeen.
1305,DANIEL HUOT,"March 25, 2020",5, The game is good and you should play it to with your friends and family. People like to play the game in there room. The best game ever. Thank you ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya.
1306,Jason Hubbell,"December 22, 2019",1, Fun game....although their bonus spin is bull.....I screenshot two of the same bonus spins with different payouts completely and questioned them about it and they told me I'm wrong and my screenshot doesn't prove anything.
1307,Eric Bewley,"January 16, 2020",5," Excellent all the way around. Lots of free chips, low prices, online or offline play, play with friends or random players, great graphics, not inundated with popups to buy more chips."
1308,Jeremiah Dupriest,"December 3, 2019",1," Very unrealistic. Info states realistic card dealings, what a joke. While no indication that it favors A certain player the hands that are dealt are very unrealistic when compared to the real game."
1309,Katlyn Lemay,"January 31, 2020",1," It wont let me open my challenges, I've uninstalled the game and nothing has worked since the last update....never had problems before Also I have paid for chips its ridiculous that there are 10x more ads then there used to be."

1312,Hollie Barnes,"February 7, 2020",4, Would of been 5 but it would loose connection halfway through a game funny enough on good hands to then it would reconnect and fold me out of the game on the bright side they are generous with chips

Since I last emailed you I'm totally disgusted with your app . Now no matter what I play turns into a losing hand. Besides you raised the ante so high none of my friends want to play anymore.

I often see people with no hand winning against a full house for example. Myself had a full house and lost everything against a high card. You should review you internal calculations in the app. It's not fun when you know you have a good hand , bet a lot, and lose to a hand inferior to yours ... Other than this totally recommend it.

You allow way too many people with multiple accounts to play and get away with cheating others. A player with multiple accounts playing on the same table more than always has a better advantage because it can dictate the amount of the pot and outcome as well.

2813,Angel Snowflakes,"November 10, 2019",1, I never minded the ads before until they actually began to pop up WHILE I was playing. My cards were automatically folded the other day because of an add and I lost my bet. This is really stupid to be honest. It makes you lose money on purpose.

With all the abuse hurled on there and the completely arbitrary decisions that make no sense for rhyme nor reason on hand wins is not worth the bother of starting all over again. I wouldn't recommend it as an app if only to pass on and find something better. Is a pity because it's actually one of the more user friendly layouts ☹
2821,Clancy Henderson,"December 6, 2019",1, This game is rigged. They have scenarios that add drama and keep the chip count going up and down. It's confirmed after researching it they don't offer a fair shuffle for players. Game play is easy it's clear I just have a problem with preconceived scenarios instead of randomized card play

Let me say what I see. These algorithms play with the players. They make the player incapable of being confident, by being able to see the losses and wins early on, then hope the players become desperate in order to lose all chip count as the game progesses. And, even more so as you progress through the leagues, stopping you from gaining any momentum; unless you're willing to lose a lot, if not all, in hopes for a restart buy-in with real money via credit/debit card. If I really wanted to pay I'd be at a casino, who don't rely on the tactics you do. Dishing out all the most desperate hands, making you lose 81% of the time. You bet and your best hands lose to terrible hands, because ""luck"" is the game. Have and ACE and KING of the same suit? (Say Spades) Watch as a ""2"" of diamonds gains 4 cards of its suit throughout the flop till the river. (Multiple times in a row) However, if you fold a terrible hand it wins on table. Have a high card, but a terrible kicker? Watch as your terrible kicker gains trips or quads, &/or both have trips after folding. (Multiple times) And, I can tell you that I've seen recycled hands in an odd rotation (Multiple times), repeating the same hands in various ways, sometimes exact, repeatedly failing. (Creating more frustration.) Then how many times do you need to fold a hand to see it will be won the next flop to river? You'll have a high card paired, but see two of the same number besides it on table, creating a trip possibility, making you scare to play aggressively. (Again multiple times) You see, I like the game, but with it being rigged, I know a lot of the fun is gone. There's also the problem with you all knowing it's highly hackable. How are we to know if it's the game, or a player working for the game or against? Why play a game where you're preordained to lose most hands? Tip the dealer? If a player catches such in casinos... The game's over. (Illegally without security...) In any other game it's based off of experience. I can't gain experience if I'm cheated. These things happen repeatedly throughout days &/or hours. With a 5% chance of winning. Also, it would be a lot better playing the game if allowed to play with people of your caliber if granted a chance. Especially, if you only have a certain amount in your account, you have no trophies, and you want to play in tournaments. Not everyone wants to pay-to-play. For those that wish to gain experience, let them please. Yet, I know you owners/creators know all this. So, seeing such disadvantages you're either negligent, &/or just don't care."

You get Friend Gifts every 24 hrs down to the second and you ONLY get to collect gifts from 10 friends all other gifts go in a bank which sucks. You literally have to keep a time record of when you get your friend gifts. They should reset the timer everyday to a specfic time like 6:00am. That way everyone knows they can collect once every 24 hrs. starting at 6am regardless of what time you collected the previous day.

You can purchase chips from packages of different sizes but I will guarantee you the program is set up to make sure you will never ever win enough to exceed the chip amount purchased. .

Pre set hands are already made(Deck is not shuffled)and handed out to players with no bias so expect to see godly hands and unlikely results. Its poker but where bluffing and betting is more a guessing game rather than a smart move or a show of player skill. Because of this, the app encourages poor poker play and shoves on the river. This app discourages playing your opponent, instead playing the pre set hand."

If you ever play the spin and win game where only 3 players, most likely the win amount will be the lesser amount (ie,, 5m buy in, 10m is the amount won for the winner, giving zynga a 5m gain regardless),not fair play. I suspect also, that there are some programs in place to play zynga poker where its zynga system that your playing against."

3508,Steven Swift,"May 31, 2019",1, I deleted this game due to losing on the river everytime since I paid money for some chips. Nothing like runner runner everytime! Definitely not random like it says... misleading and unfair for sure. Too bad too due to the fact it does have good features but its only wanting your money...

So you can play as much as you want at the lower stakes tables, max buy in of 10,000$. They increase to max buy ins of 40,000$, 80,000$, 200,000$, and so forth. The Sit N Go tournaments are good too."
3510,Jim P,"May 9, 2019",1, if your not paying for chips you will not win . you could have a great flop and even a good turn . then go all in and the river always helps the other guy . the WPT side is a joke . Rigged . I really enjoyed this app until it started showing a negative pattern . deleted .

I can't tell you how many times I've gotten pocket Ks, Qs, or As and been beaten by someone holding 2,5. Theres no reality to the game. It is so random that no one plays with any logical betting patterns. People just bet and get lucky often enough that it works. I've done it. I've gone into a room, went all in over and over, and went from $3k to $127 mil. That should not be possible. Make the game more realistic. You can get on a streak and win over and over. It makes no sense. Make it truly random instead of loading hands. A big part of poker is considering the odds of winning. That just can't be done with this game. If you like real poker, this isnt the game for you. I'm not sure where a good one is, but this isn't it. For some reason, they want you to spend real money on fake money. Why? What idiot would do this. Just take your real money to a casino and blow it there. At least you'll have a real chance of getting some back. Plus, this game is designed to make money. So you will literally lose every penny you spend just so you can spend more."
3513,MidNightToker7,"May 26, 2019",4, I absolutely love this game.

Other wise love the game, very fun!"
3642,NorseViking84,"December 26, 2018",4," It's not too bad for a poker game. I'm not particularly good at poker, so maybe I'm not having the best experience I could, but I'll try to push that bias aside and say I think it's a pretty good game for what it's worth. No complaints as far as controls or anything else goes."
3643,Eli H,"September 19, 2018",1, Typical Zynga garbage. You can't find your friends unless you're both on Facebook and you can't create a private table.

3703,Kaj Jewell,"October 14, 2018",5, Everything's great about the game. If you don't know how to play you will definitely learn. Only thing that can be a pain is if somebody just likes to prolong each and by not playing until the time Runs Out.
3704,Daniel Macculloch,"January 24, 2019",1," Using 700 mg of data, absolutely ridiculous. After researching, it appears that Zynga collects so much data on you that they can't store it all - so they just keep it on your phone. If they were clever they would sell the storage too!"

3777,David Askin,"February 24, 2019",1," The game has the cleanest poker format, however it is set up so that the newest players most often end up with the best hands. It's also designed to try to force you to buy chips at some point. It's a cheap tactic."
3778,carl anthony caral,"June 7, 2019",1, i deleted my previous post of 4 stars because your game kept on quitting unexpectedly especially when i'm in the middle of the game. it also happened several times that i can't see my cards in spin n win because it's all blotted in black. i've lost 3 games with a 5m bet.

3782,Duane Cox,"April 6, 2019",1, Geat game playing fun. i love playing poker. The reason I gave this app 1 star is because for the last 2 months I do not have the ability to watch ads for the 100000 free chips. I am always redirected to the main page.

3785,Diana Saenz,"May 2, 2019",5, Smooth and consistent. My only complaint is that we are not allowed to personalize our avatars. After a while you get to know other players by their own avatar. With Zinga there are only a dozen faces that everyone can choose from. Boring!

3947,Nat Betts,"July 28, 2019",4, enjoy the game loads... but... if you have to leave the table it would be nice to be able to share your chips equally amongst the other players... or at least have that as an option... just sayin
3948,Clint Kitchen,"September 13, 2019",1, Seriously the worst game to play it's all rigged to take your money and you can only win when you put money into the game. I hope it gets so many bad reviews that it gets removed from Google play store!!!! Nothing good to say about this game at all!
3949,SAJ AV,"June 18, 2019",1, Most rediculous one out there. After a point you will never win however good hand you may have. A completely random call for all in will fell in place for a straight or a flush for your opponent. I mean its pretty much rigged that it make sure you will nvr win.
3950,David Black,"June 28, 2019",1, The game is ruined by BOTS. I have been playing this game for years and never has it been so bad. Its mainly designed for you to watch adds and buy chips if you want to win. No more free fun. Very disappointing!
3951,Aaron Bean,"June 29, 2019",3, It would be nice to be able to find people that are not your friends And to be able to view all tables on one page and just scroll down and the farther you scroll down the bigger the stakes are And when you find a table you want to play you just click on an empty seat

3954,some other legate,"August 12, 2019",3," game was fine, the players were the problem. its hard to find a serious game people just bluff every hand. you either play along and risk losing all your chips or you keep going to new tables till you find a good game which takes forever."

And they say to contact them well the only way they tell me fo contact them is through the game which i cant get to so whatever. I normally dont do reviews either but since they waisted my time already. Dont play there games they will ban you for nothing.
4040,Damian Smith,"October 1, 2019",5, Way better than world poker tour. It's not just a real life money stealing game like WPT. You can actually play tournaments consistently and if you lose all chips you can watch short ads to get a ton back. And there's so much more. This beats WPT every day of the week
4041,John Johnson,"November 11, 2019",5, I like the graphics love the game i just wish time was faster so people can't slow play. Alot of fun

4049,A Google user,"October 12, 2018",4," Good game, but the scenery gets boring and dealer... Just minimal complaints, but over all it's great. Just turn your notifications off and it won't bug you all the time."
4050,James Schoolcraft,"October 4, 2018",5, Winning cards seem to go to the people who are on the most frequent. Needs to be a little more balanced just what I think but it passes time if I was playing with my real money I would take it somewhere else sorry
4051,bri mfc,"February 5, 2019",1, every time i opened a gold safe at the beginning i got between 5 and 10 million chips so i decided to save all of my tickets and open a ton at once. each one i opened gave me less than 1 million. this happened on two separate devices with two separate accounts. Very unfair.
4052,A Google user,"November 17, 2018",4, I wish fast play was a tad bit slower. I wish the signal for the hand being over was a little more pronounced cuz wen I'm not in a hand I kind of watch TV or just not paying attention and sometimes I miss new hand starting
4053,Ronald Plante,"February 27, 2019",3, always fun to play Zynga Poker. the only thing that seems to be a problem is the computer picks who it wants to win constantly. need to make it more random.

4057,Gina Wells,"May 2, 2019",4," I really enjoy the quick play. As as a transplant from wsop,there are a few confusing things, such as the gifts from other players and bonus gifts that states will arrive shortly but not clear where to look for them. Overall, I recommend."
4058,Shakeel Patel,"October 28, 2018",3, The game is very addictive until you run out of money. I am disappointed in the fact my rewards option is disabled and I cannot spend my tickets on anything. Other then that really fun to play
4059,casey cornaire,"December 9, 2018",3," Game is fun, not sure about bonus. It is very inconsistent. I get more on a mismatch bar then I get with 3 dogs, 7's, or cherries. No rhyme or reason behind it but the game is pretty fun otherwise"

4064,Damian Deegan,"February 24, 2019",2, I have played this game for last 5years. where it says you could a mega prize on the slot machine. you will never win more than 10% if that. I have tried for 5 years. Its rigged.
4065,Nathan Delaplain-Zook,"May 21, 2019",5, Recently poorly reviewed this game due to everyone catching on me. Upon the poor review something in the game changed and now no one catches on me. Thank you for fixing your game Zynga. 63m-5.5b in 1 day. 6/5 would HIGHLY recommend this game to a friend or a loved one.
4066,Dave Harden,"March 17, 2019",2, No. Don't like it. UI is difficult to follow and the pace of playing is too fast.

4067,A Google user,"October 2, 2018",3, Almost every time I log in and go to play it sends me to a empty table I have to log out and back in to get to a table with opponents other than that the game is very nice graphics are real nice and its fun

4069,Ami R,"September 24, 2018",5," Simple. A good game for past time. But if the money can be exchanged to real cash, it would attract more people in the world. Just a small suggestion. Overall, a good game to play. Thanks developer."
4070,Ray Reavis,"August 27, 2019",1, Any game that hides or buries the way to exit full screen gets deleted and gets a one star rating. So here ya go. Seems like it was a pretty good game but it's not good enough for me to allow it yo hijack my phone.
4071,Chad Cockrell,"August 17, 2019",5," Favorite poker app out. Great in game experience. However does lack talk in game, not many people do. Perhaps they need to create a faster way to type, due to fast gameplay. Just my opinion. Overall cant complain, as I said best poker app out in my opinon."

Hands down design is great and so many ways to hit the tables. Great tournament style poker. VIP is great aswell. Only issue I have is the only way to buy chips is going through Google which is horrible. I will not use google pay or wallet let alone google again after they closed account and wont give me my money that was on the account. Ask for me to verify myself and bank car which I did and did over 100+ times just be told the same thing everytime.

4074,CocoPlayz !,"July 6, 2019",5, I really enjoy this game! It has options on what you want to bid and how fast your time goes by. It also gives you lots of options to earn chips. This is a great game to use your time on.
4075,Stephen Holtzclaw,"November 24, 2019",1, The standard online poker with idiots going all in on 3/8 offsuit and hitting it. Not worth the time. When you run out of chips you're prompted to buy more with real cash immediately. Can you not just play free poker anymore? Uninstalled.

Why do you feel it is neccessary to manipulate the game? All players are of different skill levels & by you cheating to let inferior players with inferior hands get just the cards they need to win doesn't bode them well if they decide to play live games. You are guilty of cheating here & quite possibly will cause some to lose real money in real games. You should be ashamed of not running a straight game!
4077,Jeff Parks,"November 2, 2019",1, I've been a customer for a long time and I'm about to uninstall the app cause it never fells either I get cheated when me and another player have the same hand and you always give the pot to the other player or I have a winning hand like a straight and you give it to a player with three of a kind

4081,Rams The one,"April 1, 2019",5, I have played zynga poker for quite a few years on different accounts and it is the best poker game for me I have tried most of the others but this is by far the best and to the people who made this just continue to make the experience more diverse and this will continue to be the best poker game.

4084,Benjamin Chen,"May 23, 2019",1," ever since i spent a bit on this game i started to win a little at the start, then i lost all my hands even with the strongest hole cards, this whole app is well organised and made to keep those who spend money to continue doing so. 1 star"
4085,Raymond O'Connor,"March 9, 2019",5, Excellent app. If someone complains about zynga poker they just play dumb. I have a suggestion... Make an option where players can kick someone off a table. If a person gets 5 kicks then he is kicked off.
4086,mathieu carbonneau,"January 23, 2019",1," Was fun at first but then you start noticing that game is rigged with bots betting on crazy hands and landing straits, flushes and boats against all odds. I left wsop for this reason, this app is the same. RIP Zynga!"
4087,Sherry Bombard,"November 20, 2018",2, Sometimes very slow. Graphics boring and cant send gifts to some players. If you run out of coins cant play anymore unless buy coins. Other pocker games give you ways to get more coins without purchasing.
4088,Shane Masta,"April 29, 2019",4," great game. but more description and detail on the suit pairing would have been helpful. as well as helpful tips for beginners, since they do not know the game at all. over all, super fun!"
4089,Steve Drinkall,"April 29, 2019",4, Excellent game and Spin & Win is SUPER COOL. Would be 5 🌟 if Spin & Win would hit more than just double the ante on a regular basis. Give the winner more for winning... Gnome Saying. I love the free spins too and NO ADVERTISEMENTS!!!! AWESOME!

4091,Lily Vlogs,"October 14, 2018",3," The only thing I don't like about this game is it doesn't let you know what you have in your hand, unlike other poker games. It's hard for beginners that don't know all the hand ranks, especially when it goes so fast. Other than that, it's a great game!"
4092,DarlineImsoreal Holston,"September 30, 2018",5, It would be super if we were able to get any amount of money we want from the gifts from friends. I have over 520 gifts but can only get about 10 a day. And it is barely enough too get in a descent game with. Why let them build up like that
4093,36 25,"October 4, 2018",3," Was great until they added a bar that tells you your options every time it's your turn, blocking the view of the cards on the table, making the game unplayable"

4141,John Gist,"October 21, 2018",4," Nice to play real people. Cannot sense any bias. Wish more people would learn to play and not go all in on every hand. Most play well, but tonight was disappointing."
4142,Emile Durkeheim,"May 7, 2019",1, I got a vague message saying my account was banned because it was hacked and to contact customer service. I couldn't contact them because I boycott FB and couldn't contact through the app. Leaves me no choice but to uninstall the game and make sure that I stay away from Zynga products.

4144,brody maxwell,"December 25, 2018",1, just retried this game after several years of not playing and its so laggy it skips turns for me. ended up losing a ton of coins simply because id bet and it would freeze until ive skipped my next turn and dropping me from the game. happens almost every time.
4145,A Google user,"March 21, 2019",1, Well guess I am going to uninstall this app. To many problems here lately. Still doesn't want to open up and load. And when it does it freezes in the middle of a hand. I have tried talking to them about it and still no results. 😕😡😕
4146,Greta Rodriguez,"June 3, 2019",2, Gets a connectivity error. Plays ok on the PC with WiFi but problems there as well. Nothing wrong with the WiFi as I play all sorts of other games just fine. This one though is hit and miss.

4148,Carl Wofford,"July 17, 2019",1, I loved the game until the fake accounts took over the whole game and Zynga can't figure it out. lost too many levels. it is a bad joke. I will never buy another cbip.

4152,J Coleman,"August 18, 2019",1, great at first win win win but after awhile you can't win a game if your life depended on it no matter what cards are in your hands so be prepared to purchase chips had this on and off throughout the years throughout the upgrades and nothing changes #ripoff #uninstalled #waste of time...
4153,Hakuna Matata,"June 16, 2019",1," at first i didn't believe reviews about bots but just now while playing, it's all over 1M stakes leaving the table all at the same time with numbers as names. Might as well just play offline poker. So never spend again on this game."
4154,ALBERT BRISSON,"October 12, 2019",1, Long losing streaks even if playing conservative. To many winners on junk hands (to many off suit 2/3 or 3/8 hand winning on a all in bet). I've played and watched a lot of poker and the card play here doesnt happen in real life.

Once you have no more chips to play and are desperately to keep playing you have no choice but to use your hard earned money to purchase their playing chips."
4156,Mark Ash,"June 27, 2019",1, This game is rigged. Beware. The software is developed so that you need to pay to play on. The challenges are ridiculous so that it is impossible to achieve them. There are much better poker games available.
4157,Darren N,"September 28, 2019",3, App is great. The send people gift/ emoticons that only some people can receive is stupid. People with a trophy send all kinds of negative stuff and know they can't receive anything back. Creates poor sportsmanship. Remove the send to individual feature or open it for everyone.

4174,A Google user,"February 22, 2019",5," The improvements are great, I only have one qualm. Which is that when two or more people have a showdown it doesn't allow all parties to see what each player had unless they win."
4175,Michael Sutherland,"October 8, 2018",5, Great app but i keep having a glitch happen to me where i can not see my challenges or claim the rewards/tokens. Specificaly on a monday when the league week ends. Other than that its great.
4176,A Google user,"October 4, 2018",5, It's pretty nice. The variety of what hands you have is pretty nice. I like that you can tip the dealer also. It's a nice plus to make it more realistic. It would be better if you could tip dealers in tournaments
4177,Nick Wilson,"December 12, 2018",5, The app doesn't suck my tablet battery dry. Graphics are good. I would like to see everyone's cards when they call. We pay to see them... even if it is fake money. I'll update if they fix it.
4178,hayden welch,"November 20, 2018",1," Every time you play in sit and go the connection drops in and out making it unplayable. There's nothing wrong with my phone connection it is the app, very frustrating"

4180,Alex Strat,"June 3, 2019",5, Amazing game. Be cautious when you think that you have the nuts. That's what makes this game extremely fun. They seem to pit nuts together in the same round. Once you get used to that then you can really enjoy the action.
4181,Alvaro Barrera,"November 30, 2018",3, Controls are great except it's hard to do smaller raises which gets frustrating over time. Also it would be 5 stars if you could just play heads up or private lobby with friends only.
4182,Jonathan Deckard,"October 18, 2018",3," If you like ridiculously bad beats, first hand all ins, and bingo players, this app is for you. The sit-n-gos are quick, and they can be fun, but it's not realisic poker."

4188,Salman Ravji,"March 18, 2019",5," Started playing in the year 2008 via facebook, it's already been a decade playing poker and since it came out as an app on the phone the experience is truly amazing. Such sophisticated graphics can only made by zynga comparatively to the other poker games app."
4189,justin hartsock,"April 6, 2019",1, worst poker game on internet. hands are fake. its ok to waist time but deffinetly not worth buying any extras thru app. More than 80 percent of the time trips or better are required to win hand. multiple times i have had a full house or a straight get beat.

4198,T Bone,"June 13, 2019",5," super fun game. good prices and when gaming at work or out and about, kills the time. only downside is that it kills the battery. still though, i would recommend it to any and everyone."
4199,Mark Koval,"September 17, 2019",3, 3/5 because they ceased updates to windows on desktop. Also they don't pretend to reflect real probabilities. It seems many hands are scripted to make the game artificially more exciting. Still fun and addictive.

4203,A wayne Licht,"September 24, 2019",5," Iots of players go all in automaticly to win points, something needs to be corrected in order for real poker players to enjoy the game.

4227,Steve Swanson,"March 12, 2019",3, fun if you can take a break between bad beats and return later. watch out for the river card. its a killer. cant pass out drinks because everyone has a trophy on their table. no room for a drink.

4231,Rich,"October 27, 2018",2, Tickets are broken. Bots clearly used to clean you out. Free spin is the only way to get chips. Starts off giving you heaps. Then cuts you off encouraging you to buy. Bit of a con at the best
4232,EA 2 wheels,"September 12, 2018",4, First poker app i downloaded and im enjoying it alot. I would how ever recommend a learner class where they take you through a rough tutorial on the game and some helpful hits to look out for in a game. Great app. Having fun

4236,Ashley Harris,"May 30, 2019",4, overall love it. Wish there were more options to play with friends like tournaments (Sit and Go and Sit and Win) and also the bet/raise feature could be much easier to use the bar is not very precise.
4237,Ali,"August 29, 2019",4, Addictive but sometimes it's slow. And the rewards are not sent though. Lucy bonus spins get stuck and just keep on spinning. Frustrating when you are trying to collect the the bonuses.

4239,Daniel Fields,"June 24, 2019",5, honestly a really awesome game. best poker game I've played. I just think it would be cool if you had a collection type of thing. something similar to pokerist or wsop. I think it would be a cool addition to an already amazing app.
4240,Im Foad,"July 7, 2019",1, I just changed my 5 star rating to 1 as I lost 1.5b in one hand bcz of a simple bug in the app. my hand was the winner but it picked another player as winner . there is no account enquiry or customer service or email to complain. (reply) I did send emails no respond just auto reply .

4349,Tim Stram,"October 24, 2019",1, People cheat at this game somehow. They can't see your cards but they play multiple accounts at 1 table. You see them swapping chips when you go to pick a new table. Sucks when you're at a table vs 5 hands all controlled by 1 person

4371,A Google user,"March 30, 2019",3, game is set up to try to make u spend money on chips and if u don't your stats fall way down. I had this problem before and hoped it was fixed. until then I will be deleting my application and discontinuing my membership

4377,Tom Caluneo,"June 5, 2019",1, it's set up to just have you keep buying chips... much better poker sites to play on than this one.. but if you just want to piss money away going all in to catch runner runner every hand then it's a great app lol

4381,John-Luke Haley,"July 19, 2019",5," I love this game, I'm a billionaire at last!! It's a bit expensive to buy chips though, that's the only gripe I have. I mean, I'd actually buy lots if it was cheaper but because its not, I don't buy any!"
4382,Ryan Paul Chon,"August 31, 2019",4, Can be frustrating at times. Some hands are clearly set up to favour certain players to make for a dramatic result thus creating imbalances. I wish that was not the case otherwise this would probably be the best poker app ever.

4385,The NeverWas,"October 9, 2019",5, Great game! Smooth play. Plenty of game options. You do get some loose players but smart players can cash big on thier mistakes. Always new people to play with millions online every day. Best free only poker avalable.

4419,Shane Rutherford,"October 6, 2018",5, I like it better than all the advertising and stuff popping up in your face like it was before. they sort of got away from the game now you're back playing the game.

4421,michael wilkins,"January 27, 2019",5, its fun as fun can be and it gives you ways to get free chips if you don't have enough to play so you are always able to play. It's the best Texas holdem app and game ever made.

4463,Scott Punshon,"June 15, 2019",1, this game is a joke it never changes they only ask for review when you win but when you don't leave a positive response they rip your chip's straight away on the river card with unbelievable odds on them hands coming out I've been beat with 4 of a kind 7 times now with straight flushes joke
4464,tony ryng,"February 22, 2019",3," enjoyable but some of the leagues are a joke, 1 hour after starting i joined to find 84 people had already won 10 billion or more. that does not seem right to me not in an hour."
4465,MAJOR REACTIONs,"January 7, 2019",1," Terrible game, game play is rigged. If you have the worst hand DON'T fold go all in. You'll beat everyone at the table as the river will ALWAYS help the worst hand!! Nothing like the real game. Wouldn't recommend."
4466,A Google user,"November 1, 2019",5," I really like this game alot! Fun, fun, FUNN! I still like this game after months of playing Zinga Poker. The only complaint I have is the ""oops. Zinga poker quit unexpectedly"". Way too many times."
4467,A Google user,"September 20, 2018",1, This is the worst poker game I've ever played. The cards are not randomly selected. Amazing how always the same play happens. When you think you have a really strong hand and always someone has a better hand. Avoid this fake game!!!
4468,Naeem Baqir,"May 6, 2019",1, This game is prefabricated. first they make you win than gradually make you loose and even than you spend your money Play this game only for fun and do not spend your valuable money.

More of a comfortable poker experience than WSOP because there are less inexperienced players who get thier thrill by going 'All in' every hand. Dealing feels more fair since there's less events that contradict the flop rate that favour the event hand wins.

Folds prematurely before time is up) Good work ZYNGA!"

4505,Doom Guy,"March 27, 2019",1, Half of the games start with someone going all in before any cards have been played. The pacing of the game is too fast.

4574,Arın O.,"February 4, 2019",3, it's a good game but you should do something about the people who play on low blind tables and bet all-in every hand. Lost countless money because of them. Not fun.
4575,George Aldrich,"June 23, 2019",5, very chaledging and fun I've been playing this game for 2years. it's still the best game that i've ever played.now I've played it for over 3 years and I still enjoy it.
4576,Micheal Couch,"May 5, 2019",4, overall its what i expected it to be. only thing is i would i like an easier way to add friends who dont use facebook and play the game as a guest.
4577,A Google user,"March 24, 2019",4, The Spin and play feature is obviously rigged. It lands on the minimum 9 out of 10 times consistently. I am searching for a new poker ap.

4581,Nicolae Surdu,"May 2, 2019",1," The game incentives are to go ""All in"" all the time until it pays. As long as you always reward winnings without penalising losing, this game will be a joke."
4582,Jason Sarazin,"September 24, 2018",3, You need to show both hands when it gets to a show down. If the cards get called down after the river im paying to see their cards but it won't show.
4583,Lucas Burkhardt,"December 5, 2018",5, Best holdem for your phone. Only downside is people wait in lobbies too long so you buy in to a table where everyone has obviously been at for a long time.
4584,James Szczygiel,"April 18, 2019",1, your game is garbage. you need to fix your algorithm. theres no way 3 people on the same table are going to get full houses... this is why i keep deleting the app.
4585,A Google user,"April 6, 2019",5, The most important thing about zynga poker is that this game has been set for who will win .. the second thing some players know what cards are on the table ... I've spent a lot of money on buying chips ... Not up to 1 hours clean while play and confirm will lose..
4586,A Google user,"March 15, 2019",3," At times they wont let you win if you dont spend money or they are after my stats. Had the same problem with most poker apps. They just dont like it when u win,so the buttons freeze up."

Game play is good when you get away from the blind all in every hand kiddies but it's getting uninstalled for one single reason.

They make it a hard to reach Goal to get away from childish kiddie trolls. Have fun. Cya.
4601,Ivery Mitchell,"June 19, 2019",5, Great game! I just wish that if you win the tournament mode; you get the payout plus your buy-in back! You pay 10 mil to play and the payout is 20 mil.....makes it kinda worthless!

4621,Jesse the Florist,"December 31, 2018",5, good game but the cards should be more random. I have seen improvement over time. still a good game.
4622,A Google user,"January 18, 2019",1, This app keeps coming up every time I open up anything. I opened it up one time to see what it was and then uninstalled. Do not open it up not even once. It will haunt you forever and forever.
4623,Brian comer,"November 28, 2018",4, Sometimes can be great game . other times when people play to slow .it gets boring boringn and are you actually playing against other people and not a machine

4626,Ahmed D.,"September 18, 2018",1, I play poker normally and have done well. The algorithm used here is not realistic and pushed you to spend money. It's a scam. Be very careful
4627,A. U'd,"May 19, 2019",3, it crashes plus it clearly has patterns.... it lets u earn for some period especially if u play after some days but then phases come when every hand tends to collaps constantly..... good game though to judge ur bluffing skills 👍
4628,Robert Hostler,"July 29, 2019",4," mostly quick games with different type hands to play, spin to win or pick cash amount you want too play! ads are a pain,but get chips for watching. all ok for free!"
4629,Kaiji Itō,"June 3, 2019",1, Too unrealistic! 100% pre-arranged scenarios where you are supposed to go broke when the guy hits the one outer. Done with this game.
4630,Sergio R.,"May 8, 2019",5," Fun casual play. Some of the hands dealt feel a bit pre-made. Wish cards felt more random. Would like to see more social options, maybe a player made league or tournament."

4642,Bryan Chow,"June 6, 2019",1," Rigged and stupid. You get nice hands but the cards dealt by dealer are always not in your favor, unless you keep raising the stakes. For those who pay or invest in this game, save your money. Outcome will always be scripted and controlled."

4647,Dakota Knapp,"September 6, 2019",1, Ever since an update where they introduced random ads this game has been in the toilet. The random ads are cancer and for whatever reason the game runs a lot worse now.
4648,Clint Brown,"August 19, 2019",2," Like the game but would really like to see stats for flops seen and win percentage at showdown. I believe the current win percentage reflects total hands dealt, instead of hands played."
4649,Donald Morgan,"August 31, 2019",4, I just love this apps. Cards is more realistic with the game not co siding with any player...jus because you holding a pair of aces doesnt mean instant win like most apps.

4807,Bozking Pierce,"September 21, 2019",5," What would make this game even better is having the flush card's available on mobile friendly phones. Requesting is available online, why not on mobile too? Just asking because I enjoy both mobile and online."

Oh no wait, the abusive people playing, sending gifts and when confronted gets to the cheap talk, although not standing a chance. Then they report you. They pick the fight and cry for help. Most players are sore loser, who couldn't take the defeat and then show status in a flash. This decreases the fun, entertainment and even the authenticity of Poker. Its a gentleman game, not for such low lifes, who can't even dignify self anywhere."
4836,Lance Ifuku,"April 18, 2019",5," Yes I'm sick at home and I can play this game all day long. I like it because it has incentives to work for, many different type of games. watch your buying chips....Enjoy it thank you."

4838,Sanjoy Gohain,"December 8, 2018",1, The game is designed to give you bad beats and make you tilted so that you end up buying chips. If you love the beautiful game poker don't download this insult to the game. Read all the reviews. They all say the same thing.

4842,G W,"September 17, 2018",1," Haven't played in a couple of years because it sucked but thought I would try it again but it still sucks. I highly doubt any proper poker players play this game, it's rigged for a start."

4920,Ken H,"December 22, 2019",5," Fun game, fair enough to win 💰💰💰"
4921,William Ericson,"December 22, 2019",1, You won't open your app So I can play and lose my streak Still can't open this app
4922,Shelley Gage,"January 16, 2020",5," Fun game, no troubles"
4923,Frank Weist,"February 26, 2020",5, I like the different games and challenges.
4924,Samona Kennedy,"March 5, 2020",5, Adventurous and Fun. Never a Dull Moment.
4925,A Google user,"September 28, 2018",4," It's a card game .. you some.. lose most. When losing, sure I'm sad. When winning, it's GREAT, and I'm HAPPY... It's also GREAT that it's free and you offer videos to build up your play money... and the daily challenges ARE challenging. Soo, yes, it's FUN."
4926,Graham Smith,"April 22, 2019",5," Nice UI, plenty of free chips, wide range of table stakes. Doesn't force you to pay real money to stay in the game."
4927,A Google user,"March 22, 2019",5, it seems a lot of players just let that time go down every hand. it seem like you should fix that.
4928,Martik Panosian,"September 21, 2018",1, It doesn't even install for me. Tried several times. All failed. Downloaded almost to the end and then some error appears.
4929,E L,"March 18, 2019",1, Rigged algorithms to induce bad beats makes it unplayable.... not to mention tables are full of donks that go all in with crappy hands. Tip - never purchase chips. This app is a money hungry one.
4930,Harry Parsons,"May 8, 2019",4," I like the game but it's really irritating that ""your buddy... is online"" comes up multiple times."
4931,A Google user,"March 4, 2019",4," great graphics, atmosphere and gaming setup with great HD colors you get plenty of chips free to play, and its addicting....alotta fun..do it..."
4932,A Google user,"June 27, 2019",3, I loved this game but got rather disappointed when I reached lvl 300 n said I couldn't lvl up anymore. so now u av to either scrape through on pennies or buy chips to get anything decent
4933,Melinda Walsh,"July 30, 2019",2, I enjoy the game BUT it takes days and days to accumulate enough points to play challenges..that means leaving and playing other games...
4934,A Google user,"December 26, 2018",1, this game is so rigged. don't play it. they let u win then what ever hand you have. you will lose and lose and lose. its unbelievable. I lost 60 billion. every table you go to. it's like they have a switch and it's your turn to lose. I see it over and over again.
4935,Julie Wilson,"September 20, 2018",2, Used to love this game but now it lags nearly every hand so i end up missing hands and losing tournaments. Used my 4g and wifi and does it with both so its not my network..annoying!!
4936,Kelly Martinez,"December 2, 2018",1, This game says its completely random in game play with their algorithm but its completely opposite. Don't waste your time or money!
4937,Andy Klown,"May 18, 2019",1, this game is so badly rigged for players with high rankings. if your a lower rank on a table. the cards will always go on favour of the higher ranked player
4938,A Google user,"November 7, 2018",3, Having problems running on my Mate 29 Pro. High sound distorsions. I have to completely turn off the sound.
4939,Brandie Lynn,"March 7, 2019",5," I love this game. It gets quite intense sometimes lol. Overall it has great gameplay, it's easy to use, and it has plenty of challenges to keep things fun."
4940,Reynaldo Teves,"July 2, 2019",5," its fair, fun and entertaining. good game. sometimes, it favors the players with small stack of chips. the game however is.so controlled not free wheeling."
4941,A Google user,"January 5, 2019",5, really good game and good graphics and meet new friends from all of the world.. and I love playing cards of any kind
4942,Peter Crawley,"February 4, 2019",5, Excellent clear graphics playing on fast keeps you busy and good play is rewarded. More diverse challenges and higher bonuses could be looked at but overall 5 stars
4943,Pelebeituo Sanch,"February 3, 2019",1, This game is just a set up game apps where the company used their team or bots to extort money from the player.I just bought 10$ chips today and was playing and lose everythjng from 4bots against me.useless game.
4944,Stephanie Johnson,"January 9, 2020",5, I love this game. it has a way of getting you relaxed and excited at the same time
4945,Brian Whichard,"November 13, 2018",5," It's cool. Much better and accurate to actual holdem compared to wsop. No omaha tho which sucks, but it's still good. Also like the tournament better and the actual ability to stretch out a better buy in per table per blind compared to wsop yet again."
4946,Dean Donoghue,"October 6, 2018",5," Much easier to use than a lot of other versions,and a lot more to do as in side games and rewards"
4947,Naimesh G,"November 23, 2018",1, Very poor game. Visuals at worst. Everything is blurry and design looks amateur. Poker heat is doing better on multi player and graphics
4948,Jeannine Ary,"December 27, 2018",4," Fun poker game. Seems more like bingo than real poker, even at higher stakes. Strange poker algorithm, I got quads 2 hands in a row. Fun to play around on."
4949,Rick Beyer,"September 25, 2018",5, Lots of great interactions with players. Need to be able to turn off all the buddy notications tho.
4950,Nico Vincent Ih,"April 16, 2019",4, Nice game so far however few improvements can be made and more events can be initiated. Looking forward for this.
4951,bert catacutan,"January 6, 2019",4, i spent a lots from this but always lost for nothing the system is not so good and also spinning. very small anount of winning chips. never get the highest paid .
4952,Mahyunan Deris,"March 11, 2019",3, Fun...but it happen many time when double pair loose to single pair..the team better checked on this issue. others all great.
4953,A Google user,"February 8, 2019",4," Fun game. If u play conservatively, easy to level up and grow your bankroll. Been playin for years and still enjoy it."
4954,Nancy Dubel,"June 7, 2019",5, very Addicting game! it is like playing at a real poker table! it is nice to play with other people not against a computer! I highly recommend playing!
4955,Oliver Quipse,"June 4, 2019",1," I tried to use my FB account to log in. but, then, after I uploaded my profile picture, my account was under review by FB. Now, I can't even log in my account on my phone and messenger. I'm worried that my account has been hacked!!!!!"
4956,Alistair Coward,"June 26, 2019",3, love this game ...but recently game keeps freezing n When it catches up missed my turn had many many winning hands folded because of this fault ...sort out zynga ... not happy
4957,Eric Pool,"July 8, 2019",5," No glitches so far. I just get tired of how many times they try to get you to buy chips. If I need chips, I will get them. Don't need them shoved down my throat."
4958,Theodore Slater,"August 29, 2019",5, amazing game to play with my friends and family members to have some fun with them as I play this game it could be better if you would update a alot quickly and a like better than it does now
4959,Keith D,"August 4, 2019",4," good game but like a lot of online games, it is some snarky player who sometimes take the fun out of it."
4960,Joey Gambino,"October 8, 2019",2, It won't let me log in anymore an last week it wouldn't give me my winnings from a 500 million challenge sit and go and I had a challenge boost I took second place and should have received my winnings but I never did and now I can't log in
4961,Tim Graham,"October 10, 2019",1, The ads when you try to log out are ridiculous. Can't believe you need advertising plus you take money off people for chips for a game that you can't actually win money on. Greed is repulsive
4962,Jonathan Jay Abrantes,"October 14, 2019",5, Enjoy to play with some friends and players all over the world at any given time. Just one trouble thing i always feel difficuties bout the Raise bar level that need to address with!
4963,The SCP Foundation Official Horror Music,"October 23, 2019",3, i love this game played for quite some time like 2010 would have given 5 stars but you got rid of the low stakes tables now im limited to what i can play on it now :(
4964,Will Reno,"October 29, 2019",4, Game play is great table selection could be better... Over all great game been playing for a few years and have seen lots of changes some good some bad
4965,William Jones,"November 5, 2019",5, Very entertaining. Diverse community to play with. FUN.
4966,Kyle Parish,"November 14, 2019",1, Lost many games when i had best hand. Not consistent on hi cards splitting the winning pot
4967,Jimmy Hunter,"January 18, 2020",5, Fun Free game for poker players. I give it A+
4968,KEITH HAGEMAN,"February 3, 2020",5, I THINK IT'S A GREAT WAY TO CONSTRUCTIVELY USE MY TIME AND IT'S GREAT PRACTICE.
4969,Lajuane Moore,"April 11, 2020",3, Like this game but I had to uninstall because of the glitches
4970,Lyle Sonnenberg,"February 5, 2020",4, Fast play and fun

4973,Mulia Herni,"April 20, 2020",5, Good table n..new version
4974,Elsie Tagaloa,"January 24, 2019",4, it's excellent.. until you reach lvl 250 then everything stops! I had to delete the game. Hopefully when I want to download it again it is continuing... 😒😒
4975,A Google user,"November 9, 2018",1, What the hell happened to the Reward button. Cant see how many tickets I have.. Please fix as the app's already RIGGED.. Still cant claim the Rewards.. Why have the challenges but can't claim??..
4976,Derrick Rhodes,"April 14, 2019",4," very comfortable game to play, competition is good background should be more exciting noise in the background overall great game to play"
4977,A Google user,"March 21, 2019",5, I enjoy the game it is a great pasttime for me. It is nice to meet different people and be able to chat with them as well.
4978,Amanda Rose,"April 23, 2019",5, i love it! wish there were more ways to get chips but other than that its super addicting and fun.
4979,A Google user,"March 3, 2019",4, Pre turn buttons are in a bad spot. Easy to accidentally call due to mistimed tap. Be nice if a new card game was added
4980,Patrick B,"March 15, 2019",1," too busy interface, seems like you're playing against bots given the speed. way too much junk in the interface, uninstalled."
4981,James Schubert,"May 8, 2019",1," After 2 weeks of good play my account was banned witout warning or explination. the only options to contact support were via facebook which i don't use. Terrible experience, guess since I didnt buy any chipss with cash they're happy to jusst ban someone."
4982,Stefan S,"December 12, 2018",1," This game has to be the worst poker game around. The hands dealt are fake, there is no spirit of card manship.. Purely a money fleecing, poorly constructed app that brings the game it is meant to represent in to disrepute. Not worth any stars"
4983,A Google user,"January 12, 2019",1," too many fixes. sure half the opponents are computerised and when you get a fantastic hand, they have just the one better."
4984,A Google user,"December 5, 2018",4," A little more time to read explanation when ""jackpot"" pops up on your player. New to this technology."
4985,A Google user,"October 1, 2018",5, Brill game had it installed for years comes with me with every phone upgrade but the winners tax can take the mick sometimes and frustrating but will always play it best poker game I have found
4986,Yoli Brown,"December 4, 2018",5, I love playing whenever I have some free time however if you get distracted u could make a bad move it happens to often so I recommend playing when u have the time don't rush
4987,Arif T,"January 17, 2019",5, good game but can you set a feature to allow profile pic without using facebook?. Guest users should be able to load their own pics.
4988,Lindy Hynes,"April 13, 2019",1, It's the dumbest game ever. every game that you plays their is like two or three players that got the same hand you can't win any chips at the tables or when you takes your free spends.
4989,james casal,"May 11, 2019",5, Had an issue when I created an account. customer support helped out right away. no pop up or ads like other games.
4990,Chris English,"September 24, 2018",5, Having more fun and not as bothered by ads or as pushed to spend money like on other poker apps. This is my favourite one!
4991,A Google user,"October 2, 2018",5, By far this the best site to play on. It's fair and reasonable play. I've been playing for five years. This is the one LOVE to play.
4992,Jeff Byland,"October 17, 2018",5, Veryfast pace. Also betting from phone app is not smooth. If i dont bet correctly and quickly i often am passed by or only make a minimum bet.
4993,Kendra Blain,"March 20, 2019",4, Game is great. Banners across the top of the screen every time a buddy is online playing is extremely annoying.
4994,Debbie Wickes,"December 17, 2018",5, Love this game ! I like using the meter bar ! Like the fast pace. Awesome game !
4995,lisamcorkle,"April 27, 2019",5," fun, they give you lots of chips to keep playing. No ads is a plus!"
4996,sebastian simanjuntak,"May 14, 2019",1," great no more beginners luck. change policy? I'm glad was wrong. now after level 19, dipping again. i was dealt same card in 10 hands... 😃😃😃"
4997,Marv Ellis rivers,"November 29, 2018",5, Really fun so far. And the sit and go's can be intense! I like this better than the WSOP game that I just deleted. Definite keeper!!
4998,Azlizan Jasli,"May 22, 2019",5, win or lose..its just a game..for me this game can make me feel how the way I have play in the real poker..i hope they can make more sales promotion for buy-in the chips..and still 5star because i really enjoyed this game..
4999,Kuldeep Gaurav,"June 9, 2019",2," Network problem began 3 months into the game. My net speed is same as before when it ran smoothly, i checked it just to make sure, kindly fix it."
5000,A Google user,"March 15, 2019",5, Great game play. i like being able to do WPT. i wish itd give me back my left over change when the slow internet boots me off a tournament. Idk how theyd incorporate that. itd be nice though. Great interface!
5001,Charles Bailey,"October 21, 2018",1, How in the hell can 40 gold coins only bring in 6 million in chips. Also it says fair play and yet when you play with lower lvl ppl they always win. My opinion obviously no one at Zynga has actually played Texas Hold'em. Deleting acct.
5002,Robert Coram,"September 21, 2018",5," Finding tables is short and simple. Each hand is fairly quick, but offers enough time to decide bets."
5003,John Geddes,"December 10, 2018",1, Games a fix soon as u buy any bundle you lose all the time so you buy more even with pocket aces or even a full house you always lose. Better off being robbed from a drug addict probably more honest than this mob
5004,Michael Poole,"December 23, 2018",5," hey Zynga I just finished my league for the week and did not recieve my 55 tickets, can you please add those to my account. thank you Great game as long as you can stay away from the blind betters.

If you have a Weekley poker night or just like the game, you will have fun and sharpen your skills at the same time."
5005,BUGZ BUNNY,"September 13, 2018",1, How come everytime a developer updates an app they don't test it before they give it to the public and we have to go through this garbage of non connectivity why !?!
5006,JR2016,"December 4, 2018",2," Was a Great poker app, easy and clean until they wiped out the money I earned. I worked hard to earn it and then they updated and wiped it out. Such BS...going to uninstall."
5007,Emmeric Wong,"March 29, 2019",1, So much for fair game. If a player has a higher stack in sit n go it's always a sure win for him whenever the other player shoves.
5008,sharon gayle,"May 30, 2019",5, love playing this game like the new features! and as its a while since I played last I'm enjoying climbing back up the leagues.
5009,smash1k1,"May 28, 2019",1," Game is at least hacked, probably rigged too. More than once I've gone all in on a good hand...game or hack folds my hand. This app should be called Zynga really crappy poker..lol"
5010,William Coats,"June 9, 2019",1," Every single tournament without fail will have 1st round, before flop, all-inners or someone who bets the minimum every single round for no reason. Not worth the time you'll never get a decent game."
5011,Terri Pitts,"June 8, 2019",1, bonus chips have shrunk considerably in the last 9 years. also trophies are missing. it's the spin when you get your bonus chips are way below par y'all need to fix this
5012,Zack Hurt,"June 11, 2019",1, Do not download if you enjoy poker. This game is very very fixed and once you get a certain amount of money it doesn't let you win anymore. Absolute joke
5013,Wayne Bickerton,"August 29, 2019",3, The game is rigged. There is ALWAYS a lucky seat that cant lose until a mew player joins the table. Many times I have lost with pocket aces to someone with a 2.
5014,Trevor Mccall,"September 16, 2019",4, Great addicting game only flaw is in the sit and go when the wheel gets spun to see what your going to win. IT ALWAYS LANDS ON THE 2 SMALLEST AMOUNT EVERYTIME!!
5015,Addison Adams,"June 20, 2019",5, I really like playing this game. other games are so tight with the chips you'd think it was real money or something. ... Thank you for an enjoyable experience. ..!;^)
5016,My Business,"September 20, 2019",4, 4 star because I'm not fully satisfied due lots of cheaters and hackers. They use wall hacks. They can see through all cards on the table.
5017,Matthew Beven,"June 29, 2019",5," Just updated, there was slight issue on table but I logged out before updating due to failure of my current ISP from following the Tmobile and FCT conditions stated."
5018,Cenk Gökçe,"October 20, 2019",1, aren't more graphics possible? instead of popping up staff? also change of controls are not correct. when i try to pre check sometimes i call big amounts. this is same for years. do something zynga
5019,Nathan Andrews,"July 4, 2019",1," definition of pay to win. if you sit at a table with someone who just purchased anything through the game, you will lose. the game will make them win."

5021,Jake Dehoedt,"October 1, 2019",1," Rigged, you only get good hands if you buy chips and they reward the players who go all in with better hands.They have started putting in ads too... won't be playing anymore."
5022,Brian Heyne,"October 24, 2019",3," The game is fun but there is no more 400 tables since the update, wont be playing as much, it was more fun with less money"
5023,Paul D,"October 2, 2019",2, Playing game regularly past 3 wks now and the game lags a few seconds so much making me lose millions of chips and auto fold on hands that I could of won. Tried everything to fix it why the lag?
5024,Peter Benson,"November 7, 2019",1, They deactivated my account without explanation a day after I made a purchase in their app. There's no way to contact customer support without an account. Not an appropriate way to treat customers.
5025,Rajibur Rahman,"September 13, 2019",4, The app is great and feels good to play zynga poker. But they don't distribute carda randomly. They claim fair game but it is not. They play with your mind nicely.
5026,Amanda garty,"November 13, 2019",1, Not happy as I cant log in to facebook or create an account as it comes up with error
5027,Eric S,"September 28, 2019",1, lost my money more then once. also does not run on my large display android 1920x1080 display. crashes every time I try to open it.

5029,Kevin S,"October 7, 2019",4," Easy to learn, hard to master. Some times it makes mistakes and calls cards that aren't on the board. But, still fun."
5030,Tou Moua,"December 10, 2019",2, Another time wasted which doesn't represent poker statistics.
5031,jared stuhltrager,"October 24, 2019",3, These days they are literally allowing ads that hijack your screen and try to trick you into downloading something which puts a damper on the play that is normally decent

5033,Clayton Thompson,"November 1, 2019",1, Worst game. The game still chips from you every hand you play out of your bank. You won't notice it too it is too late.

5040,Hector Rivera Atiles,"March 28, 2019",1, Don't bother playing because it falls short of real entertainment. It's riddled with bots & your winnings will only wane away from the constant hackers.
5041,A Google user,"November 25, 2018",5, The daily challenges are where the money is and daily challenges are easy to navigate you to the best tables.

5044,Najlaa Kimball,"January 21, 2019",2, The game does not respond to selections during poker time. I have kicked of games do to freezing in the middle.
5045,ThSAWistheLAW WC,"October 10, 2018",2, This app is 100% all about trying to get you to buy more chips. Understandable from a business standpoint. But to me it is more frustrating than it is fun.
5046,Julian Rachev,"December 10, 2018",3," Good design, but unreal hands. Too much manipulating games. Often an algorithm decide who to win."
5047,A Google user,"March 15, 2019",4," great game ,.... but every once in a while it will not give you your coins from the free spins but i love it im hooked"
5048,Shelly Habberfield,"July 15, 2019",1, sucks. they took away my video spins three times now and said theyre testing it out on people. Sounds unfair to me. also won $66 million yesterday and now this morning its only $15. hate this game anymore. they have no desire ti fix anything for their players
5049,Nasz Syarul,"February 15, 2020",3, Too long to open the apps!

5053,Jamie Stewart,"December 6, 2018",4, Good time killer but is set up by challenges geared towards depleting your chips. To wit keeping you buying chips. There are always some that just cannot spend wisely. Site should send chronic spenders a warning of over spending and possible need for counseling.
5054,Ali ElDorado,"February 8, 2019",5," Always loved this game, been playing many years. Never had any problems with the game. Thanks Zynga!"
5055,A Google user,"October 24, 2018",4, I have downloaded and undownloaded a few different poker games for the phone.... Easy to get chips only downsides are that it's hard to quickly and accurately raise and you can't have custom photos
5056,Vijay Boopathy,"December 11, 2018",1, Please stop vibrating the device. It should not be your default setting. We r coming to play pleasure. You are pressuring with the vibration and noise.
5057,A Google user,"November 1, 2018",5, I have been playing for about 4 years now. I can not wait until you all start incorporating the ability to win real cash prizes like some gambling web sites. Keep up the good work.
5058,Dave Coombs,"November 8, 2018",1," Too many ads! Clearly you have to buy chips before you will catch a break and win a few hands, not free game play"
5059,A Google user,"April 6, 2019",4, would like to have a little more time on each turn but understand why they have the time limit to keep the game moving. Along with the blind increases.
5060,William Proffitt,"December 23, 2018",1, Rigged to encourage players to pay money. Too many bad beats and when you get them they throw pay to play micro transactions at you. They shouldnt be allowed to charge for virtual chips like this.
5061,Adam John George Collins,"April 5, 2019",1, The rules to this are not fully correct. For example I had A—7 and my opponent has A—6 we would split the pot. This is not right.
5062,A Google user,"December 30, 2018",4, I love playing on zynga poker but when there is a problem with the app there is no response when trying to contact.
5063,douglas perez,"October 29, 2018",5, Great game...the key is finding a $$$ level you feel comfortable with and leaving when your ahead that round

5070,Black Templar,"June 3, 2019",5, good fun poker game.....quite expensive buying the chips using real money....and the challenges quickly become either unachievable or require you to spend real money....WSOP is also a good fun game
5071,Ichambancigmail Radjasawariasissy,"July 12, 2019",5, This is most Excellent in design and very good User Interface of a Poker Games I have ever played. You all Android user have to try and play this 'Zinga Hold Em' in Your Smartphones.
5072,Jeremy Baybayan,"June 6, 2019",5, The sit down tournaments and also spin and go tournaments are fun. The live games are awesome too. Great poker app. only suggestion is maybe swap out the dealer once in a while. She keeps dealing bad beats.
5073,IGCuber,"June 25, 2019",5," Fun and additive, but in a good way. Play for 5 minutes or 5 hours. Great game!"

5076,Ugo Freda,"July 24, 2019",1, algorithm is screwed up... too many big hands show for the player who calls.. almost 90% of the time. unrealistic.
5077,Juan P. Jordan,"August 18, 2019",5," Great app to learn how to play and have free fun. But if you want to become serious about poker, you need to play with real money"
5078,Math Is Truth,"October 28, 2019",3, The will be better if ot was not rigged at certain moments. There are times I have no winning hands after 16 playing hands. It ridiculous.

5096,Julz S,"December 31, 2018",4, Pretty decent poker game. Doesn't pay correctly on the free spins. Other than that it's not a bad game.

5098,roger gibbs,"August 26, 2019",2," excellent poker if it. was not as geared up to pay to play. if it was a bit fairer I would give it 5 🌟 s I have changed my mind cos zynga seem to have changed the rules. Again today a full house beat a flush, don't know what is happening with the game 😕😕😕😕"
5099,Bill Havlik,"May 21, 2019",4, fun game..but they dont show all the hands that stay would be nice to view cards of all that have stayed in the pot... to see if your opponent was bluffing or not
5100,Damian Johnson,"December 17, 2018",1," Horrible payouts , spent real money on this game and very quickly just went away even after winning big hands payouts just disappeared so quickly . Not recommended"
5101,Christopher Dunn,"August 21, 2019",1, You are better off flipping coins. This app is the worst app on google play. Never spend money as an engineer already came clean about how Zynga operates. The cards are not randomly chosen. They admitted it. This is not poker. This is a tattered effigy of poker.
5102,Deon Bennett,"April 18, 2019",3, The only negative thing I will say is the game seems to favor the chip leader. Otherwise it's the best poker game out there!

Does not change the fact that this is very poor attempt by Zynga. you call your spin n win fast paced ? no its slow, sluggish and boring. i suppose the poor graphics in Zynga poker does not help but having WPT in background wont save that."
5109,gaz woodfine,"May 9, 2019",1, kicked from the game for no reason tried to log in to find my account suspended and when trying to contact support it doesn't work I loved the game now its ridiculous

5120,Lori Owens,"February 14, 2019",3, still a good game but its been awhile since i have played and the game is quite a bit different than it was before. still a good game though.
5121,Lulu Harris,"October 22, 2018",5, Love this game... taught me how to play poker. Really excited when I win but slightly addictive. Would recommend to my friends.

5123,Michael Fussell,"April 12, 2019",1, ads have gotten so bad and bonus spins have gotten so low its unplayable. i would buy chips fro. time to time but not anymore
5124,mark white,"November 16, 2018",2, This site says that it monitors bot and cheaters. It clearly does not. If you spend money here you are going to have to spend regularly. This site is all about taking your money and does nothing to insure fair play. If you file a complaint you will lose even faster.
5125,Inoke M,"March 10, 2019",1, This is the biggest cheating app ever! The cards are not random. They're delt specifically for someone to win. Complete rip off especially if you put money in it! Don't download this POS app!

5129,A Google user,"April 6, 2019",5, you need to put more chip gift packs like the ones on facebook should be same value we should be able to load our own pictures to use as our identifiers not the same old avatars😉...otherwise love the game and totall addicted
5130,Michael Coleman-Berry,"January 4, 2019",5," This has been the only online poker app I have used. Love the new changes, only thing I miss is the shoot out."
5131,A Google user,"December 8, 2018",1, If you like this game it's because you don't know how to play poker. Creates hands designed to bust players so they'll buy more chips. So bad it's funny.
5132,Candee,"March 22, 2019",2," Every day it shuts down several times. Every day, I have to uninstall and install again, then it works. When it's working, it's a lot of fun."

5148,Albert Zee,"October 25, 2019",1," good app, problem is that whole game is rigged to make users to buy more chips after certain time .....that means, after time you have no chance to win any hand"
5149,Laura Clinton,"October 14, 2019",5," I love to play, but the bully players who go all in on every hand before the flop are really aggravating."

5163,Funny Times,"May 24, 2019",1, Zynga needs to be shunned for the thievery they run bots. Scripts have no part in poker. Zynga a big middle finger. They have been around for ten years and the highest level is 300. Really a sorriest game on Google's platform.
5164,Phillip Camick,"February 21, 2019",5, great setup. good starting chips and they seem to pair you with similarly leveled opponents instead of throwing noobs in with sharks. free daily spin is great!

5174,James A,"January 19, 2019",1, Game is Obviously Rigged to get you to spend money on chips out of irritation. Clever marketing but still a scam. World Series Of Poker is way better and fair. You still get those all in donkey's but at least it's not rigged.

5188,Gregory Borrelli,"August 3, 2019",5, Game is mostly realistic up's and down's sometimes it's a bit much... But the app itself is top notch you can find friends easily And set up rooms all in all it's a good time

5190,Thomas Frechette,"September 29, 2019",1, I was banned for absolutely no reason. No way to contact them and ask why. Never violated any of the terms EVER. Probably banned for not buying chips with my debit card. Always logged in as a guest. Think it's offensive they don't even tell you what you are banned for.
5191,Steve Taylor,"September 22, 2019",2," Some games are not equal has certain players get full house's thee and four times Una's many hand's am considering deleting the game altogether, don't mind losing but thirty-two million in five hand's is a joke."
5192,Anthony gatt,"June 30, 2019",1," App don't work properly, Ripped me off with payments & when I go tip it doesn't work most of the time. It slowly reduces your money so you have to buy."
5193,Rimantas Ri,"September 28, 2019",5," It's a great game! If you don't have real cards and chips, then go playing this, but of course, you need to know the rules of Texas Hold'em poker."
5194,Peter Ashford,"July 9, 2019",4, pretty good game. players from beginners to the more experienced are pretty good too.

5197,Sonny Nguyen,"October 31, 2019",1, Played this game for years and the recent update they took out the small low buy-in table is ridiculous. Will uninstall until it's fixed or reverted.
5198,derick jenkins,"September 17, 2019",4, My only issue is it glitches and freezes up occasionally. Often causing me to time out and fold my hand. Its pretty annoying

5213,Andrew sorichetti,"May 21, 2019",4," Great app all around. Unfortunately, I have recently lost 50M in chips due to connection loss. For this, I give Zynga a 4 on their app."
5214,A Google user,"March 2, 2019",2," To the app developers, As a Zynga Poker user for more than 3 years. I believe that everyone should be allowed to put any Pictures as a profile without the need of signing to any Social Media. 😁 Thank You."
5215,Maen Zubaydi,"January 3, 2019",1," Got a notification to update the app so I did, the new version took away all my 10 million chips and stats and gave me 80,000 with a msg saying ""here's 80k chips on the house"". Oh thanks Zynga for the sneaky trade.. uninstalled immediately."
5216,Sid Madon,"April 21, 2019",3," Great poker game Please make crads different colors. Spades and Clubs look the same at a glance. How about Heart red. Diamond blue, Club green, Spade black, or something like that."

Not one decent winning hand. Not a winning had at all discounted the bluffs. Stupid game they neex to fix the odds. What a pos. And to add to it the game robs you. When I do win I receive my chips then all of a sudden some disappear right before my eyes. Not only does the game f u with the odds they steal your chips as well!"
5221,Paulose Varughese,"January 18, 2019",5, good poker game. good way to hone your game against real players. most players don't fold enough so end up losing all their chips.
5222,Chris DiDonna,"May 7, 2019",1," Do not spend any money, you will lose it fast no matter what cards you have. Also you will play against bots"

5224,Sam Winlym,"November 7, 2018",1, I like only the old version Zynga Poker Classic which I can't play any longer. I hope if the game developer makes it possbile to it play again (the older version).

5227,Robert Tika,"July 25, 2019",5, Very intelligent game but some players play too slow and they should be eliminated from the table so others can continue playing like professional Poker players.
5228,William Anderson,"May 6, 2019",1, this game is sucks so bad dude im telling you all u got to do is be the guy with the most chips and the rest is yours downloaded and played every table i played the guy with the most chips always won a hand in some type of way played five tables back to back and it happen each time

5237,Weslie Unruh,"May 4, 2019",4, love the game. been playin zynga fer at least 5-6 years now. have tried others but they are not the same.
5238,A Google user,"March 9, 2019",3," Awesome fun to play when it dropped, lately there's a lot of bots in lobbies, its injured gameplay pretty badly but it hasn't killed it yet."
5239,SAMUEL AFFLICK,"May 31, 2019",4, I am enjoying the game I just think spin games are rigged for your not to win a lot. Always the lower limit of payouts
