Reminds me of PCs in the 1990s. Typing is also a nightmare, it'll often lag and not show anything you've typed, only to suddenly all appear as if a ghost is in your phone. I use the Samsung browser now. Not perfect, but it's not broken like Chrome."

I echo the same complaints as other reviewers in regards to ads popping up when I click on content that I would like to read and more disturbing when I don't touch my phone at all.

Now out of nowhere my credit card is showing up for in-app purchases when I never did any more than type it into eBay. Connecting accounts by default like this is a HORRIBLE idea. If someone ever managed to hack my account they could drain my college savings fund and I'd be up a creek because it's debit not credit. I managed to fix this by going to settings but sharing sensitive, dangerous bank information by default without an opt-in is very dangerous. #dontBeEvil. P.S.

Since all of my passwords ect. were saved, I can't seem to remember what they were when going onto another browser!! It's a bit inconvenient.."

Why would you want Home and Search on the bottom but not the one function that you use almost every few seconds? You might as well just get rid of the bottom bar at that point. I don't want to go back to having to activate one handed mode or use both hands to do a basic function that was perfectly fine where it was. You didn't even put anything else down there. It's just more empty space now. Very very very silly change.
