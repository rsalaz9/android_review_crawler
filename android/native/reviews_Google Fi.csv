Fi Support is responsive, efficient and easy to contact via the app. The cell service itself is where the problem lies. Most of the 'unlimited' data is wasted through constant updates (for other paid Google services) and phone resets (initiated per Fi support). It's not uncommon to lose or barely be able to get LTE signal at times, even in metro areas. I regret leaving Verizon and plan to return asap!"
1,Martin Brown,"April 30, 2020",3," This is really just a way for google to monetize Google voice/Hangouts. Found a much cheaper phone plan, but now if i opt out I lose my google voice #.

Found a much cheaper phone plan, but now if i opt out I lose my google voice #. They're still charging me the basic rate even though I'm no longer using the service. The good thing about google voice is that you can integrate it into any phone service, so technically you can keep the same # forever. Is a phone # worth $20/month? Hmmmmmm...."

I am so livid right now....."

SUPPOSEDLY it picks between wifi and cell for the best quality call. It always chooses cell data for extra charges. Also, Internet speed is half the speed of a local sim when I do a speed test. UPDATE. Generic response. It NEVER uses wifi calling bc I was told it selects the best connection. Which is ALWAYS sim and not wifi. Even though I have no prob with Skype"

If you're figuring it out, just go to their website instead of this. Just at a glance, looks a lot better than other carrier apps to deal with your account, but when I wanted to uninstall it, my phone (Pixel 4) assumed it was a factory app and didn't let me uninstall. This makes no sense to me and now I can only disable this app."
5,Jasmin Afanador,"April 24, 2020",4, I love Google Fi! Just activated my new Google Pixel today after being with Google Fi for a long while. Setting up the SIM FREE activation and copying everything from my old phone was so simple it's mind-blowing. Hopefully after a few days on my new Pixel 3a I'll be coming back to give 5 stars.
6,Anthony Bear,"April 30, 2020",2," Having trouble with eSIM. Will not click through, keeps telling me to insert SIM card. Will edit and update review once i can use the service. Update: followed your instruction, still no good. I need a human to help."
7,CeeCee,"April 26, 2020",2," I experienced many issues from the start, signal wasn't reliable, extended delays when placing a call even when I had a full signal, I loved the idea, plan price and features if it had worked properly ;("
8,Paul's Email,"April 28, 2020",1," Can't delete app, no longer use this service. Only disable is available. Obtrusive! Customer service is 100% useless over my 2 years of use. Just left for T-Mobile. This service is garbage and over-priced too."
9,Nate N,"May 1, 2020",1," Painful phone service. Dropped calls, people can't hear me, bad quality. I have to spend hours on work calls all day in many areas. Not very reliable and not great price compared to some of the $30/unlimited 3rd party cell plans available now."
10,kit Otto,"April 30, 2020",2, esim randomly disappears and it's not always easy to download. Being without phone or text on several occasions without an explanation for why or any pattern isn't really acceptable.

Google Fi does not provide data on Korea ""officially,"" but it works very well. So it made me save money from paying two data service for American and Korean services. I did have some issues with bill last month, but their feedback was fast and nice."
12,Bob Dupuy,"April 27, 2020",5," Just switched 2 Pixel 2XL phones from Verizon. Switchover was easy as pie. Too early to tell about costs, but it knocks the ball out of the park compared with Verizon performance and it will be WAY WAY cheaper."
13,Randy McQuay,"April 24, 2020",5, Exceptional. Easy to setup and billing is straightforward. All will excellent features and very fair price.

I use quite a bit of data and my phone bills always seem to be quite High. However I woke up this morning to discover that my phone bill was going to be quite low because you taking this pandemic into consideration as far as people staying connected. And I find myself this morning wanting to give you guys a big thank you. I recently lost my job. So thank you.

I hardly ever receive an active call. I have missed many important calls while abroad bc there was no sound, or connection dropped. If they dont leave a message you never know who called bc when abroad they use a local service for your calls and a different number for ever call. So the calls say Nigeria, but it may be from USA. So i give 3 stars."

Calls are often dropped and service is limited in a lot of places compared to Verizon. Idk what's happening to Google but I'm highly disappointed and will be switching back to Verizon in the near future."
18,Seen Enkidu,"April 29, 2020",5," I'm glad I switched to Google-Fi 😍 Great service 👍 Save money 💰 No hassle 😇 Manage your plan, account, payment, and get help from customer support though the app 🤓 Thanks Google ✨"

Neither a Samsung S9+ or Apple 11 are compatible. Only simple texts to one person at a time are included. Shame. (I contacted Fi support twice before I wrote this review. They're answers were cryptic. No fine print on their website saying MMS is paid data)"

My phone got number got ported wrong and I was having insane difficulties calling people and it took a long time to resolve I couldn't even use the ease I'm on my pixel like they said so I have to use a regular sim but my employer that I work for which is a hospital in my town can't even call me. Extra billing charges and more!

I was constantly repeating myself so the other person could attempt to hear me. Unable to use data simultaneously in 2020 while on a call is a joke. I was instructed to make network specific changes before EVERY CALL in order to use data while on a call. So when I received a call, I had no luck. Overall terrible as a provider. Left after four months of constant struggles."

Nothing worked. Not worth jumping through all these hoops to get a simple activation done."

Very frustrating it took 11 days to identity the problem (eSIM mgr app) and consumed many hours of my time throughout. Hopefully an isolated experience."

Those meet the requirements listed on the Google Fi website to work with AT&T & T-mobile. Given that, will the Honor 8X (JSN-L23) work on Google Fi? You might want to update the Honor 8X listing."

It all started with a device protection claim where they sent me a phone that overheated on the first charge to the point it shutdown. After that experience, I have returned the damaged phone they sent me and have been trying to recover the charge of my canceled claim. My case has involved over ten different customer service reps, 6-7 phone calls, and dozens of emails, and they still can't refund the correct amount to my credit card that the Google Fi support personnel agree should be refunded. Instead other unknown and unspecified Google Fi charges appear on my credit card. They even escalated my issue to their engineering team, which took A MONTH to get get a response back from, and STILL, incorrect and unexplained charges appeared on my card, and no correct refund. And now, with the intervention of engineering, my bill/statements on the Google Fi site are modified and wrong where previously at least my statements were correct. Google Fi is just not capable of getting this right. I give up. I'm cancelling my account and contesting the incorrect charges with my credit card company. Quite simply, this has been, with no exaggeration, the worst customer service experience I've had in my entire life. I find it interesting that they do not show reviews or allow new reviews to be written in the mobile Play Store."

I live/work in a major metro, on every call I can hear others (usually) but they say I'm dropping out. On a road trip across the country just forget about using your phone. Even if a call gets through as soon as the tower gets far enough away and finally switches you will lose a good 30 seconds of the conversation IF it doesn't disconnect on you first.

Their response? THEY CANCELLED THE ORDER!!! ' I've been with Google Fi since they were Project Fi...but this is worst customer experience I've had with ANY B2C company in the last 12 months!!! Again, phone service is fine...but customer service is abysmal!!!

Fi combines multiple networks into one virtual network, which I assume improves coverage. I haven't seen any issues with coverage. Fi works seamlessly on my Pixel 3. Fi works through Gmail on a computer too, which is really nice. Fi customer support is great, which is surprising because Google historically has had poor customer support. Google says Fi has good international coverage, although I haven't had a chance to test that out. Fi allows international calls, with extra fees, although I rarely place international calls. The Fi Android app is fine too. Usable, though it may not have every feature the website has. I haven't had to use it too often, which is probably a good thing."

If you are using and iPhone, all your issues are much worse and far more frustrating. Unreliable service and poor customer support: Your service will completely drop for days, weeks or months. The customer support team will tell you they cannot control for intermittent connectivity issues outside the U.S. Well, I've gone weeks without service with Fi while my work phone and my roommate--who has the same phone, in the same location, and also a Fi user--have no issues. It's also not likely a phone-specific issue because this is my third phone (I've had two Androids and one iPhone) with Fi. Customer support will send you an email with five steps (like removing your SIM card and turning off automatic cellular detection). If their five steps don't work, you are all on your own. They will literally refuse to even escalate the issue beyond the first level of customer support. iPhone Users: it is next to impossible to send photos and videos via text message. More frustrating, you cannot send texts to group chats that include non-iPhone users. Overall, very frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to troubleshoot issues with an unhelpful customer support team."

I spend more time trying to stay connected than I spend using my phone. People who have heath contitions (like heart failure) should not rely on this as your only source of communication. Im sure, like Google Voice, once the bugs are worked out it'll be fine. My heart just cant wait gor that day to come. I dont know what freaky world these other reviews came from, but I didnt get the service they are talking about."

Known issue they're  workingo on WORKAROUND is  to go to the Google Fi website  select Google Voice i lower left corner, and play the voicemail from there --- BUT that has to be done from a device other than the Fi phone since the phone will try to throw you back into the app. Sigh. On the other hand the app did give me the text transcript of the message, which would have been sufficient for most non-technical calls.  So: It's software. It isn't 100% bug free yet. But overall it's been working well 99.9% of the time, and I very much like the price plan; great for folks whose data usage is minimal to moderate. I'm willing to help them debug an occasional glitch in exchange for that. USEFUL TIP: If you're inundated with spam calls despite their filtering attempts, you can set do-not-disturb to only accept calls from folks in your contact list; others will go straight to voicemail."

However, my experiences since October 10th has been working its way through the last 3 years of good will, souring me more and more on the service. When returning from a trip abroad, my Pixel 2XL got locked in an infinite restart loop. After several attempts to fix it (including attempting a factory reset from recovery mode, which failed), I contacted Google Fi customer service via e-mail. They suggested a few things I had already attempted, none of which worked when I retried them. Then, they went silent. Three days later, I tried chatting online with Fi customer service, who said they would send me a replacement phone, but, when they tried, said there was a problem and that a Specialist would contact me via e-mail. Two days later, without a peep from them, I tried chatting again. I was re-informed that a Specialist would contact me via e-mail. So I poked @GoogleFi on Twitter, where they said that this was not the customer service experience they wanted me to have and, if I could follow them and send a message, they would get it resolved. So I did. Their ""resolution""? I was re-re-informed that a Specialist would contact me via e-mail. I'm coming up on two weeks without a phone at all, and still no e-mail from the elusive Google Fi Specialist. Indeed, the only e-mail I've gotten from Fi in that time was my bill, which they didn't seem to have any problems sending me."

I probably got at least 5 people using it but then I encountered an issue and really poor support. For the last 5 days, I have not been able to send any text messages. I can apparently still receive them but nobody else can see what I send. I've spent collectively over 2 hours with support to arrive at the conclusion that everything has been done and that I'll have to return to the US to get more support. I've been traveling for 3 months and buying a spontaneous ticket home to get ""more support"" is no solution at all. I was then told that because I can still receive messages, this is not a serious problem. I find that a completely ridiculous response. Nobody would sign up for a communication service that doesn't allow you to communicate. What a seriously disappointing experience. As of now, I have no solution. I guess I'll go a few weeks or months without being able to use the phone service I am paying for before returning home and switching networks. I'm never going to use Google Fi again after this or ever recommend it to anyone. You've been warned, stay away from Google Fi."

We switched from FreedomPop which runs on Sprint network but their app continually had issues and crashed regularly. I read up on which networks Google Fi uses and our area was a good fit. We gave it a try and so far we have not had any issues with calling or texting or data.

They are saying we need to contact Samsung. BEWARE, it's not the integrity and ease of customer service that I once thought about this company.

Turns out it's just the terrible service. Says unlimited data but really it's 15 gb of data (which for a normal person is like two weeks of casual browsing and podcasts) and then it throttles almost to a complete stop making your phone useless unless you're on wifi. I ended up having to buy more data at 10$ a gb because I needed my phone for work and at the end of the month my bill was 177$. This is a joke. Do not get this service.

I would never do this for a single incident, unless it was this REDICULOUS and such a blatantly aweful example of complete disregard for doing the right thing. Last year, after having fi for a year, we traded in 3 phones through their buy-back option at the same time that we purchased 3 brand new phones. We got our new phones, activated them, and sent back our original fi phones. About a week or so later, Google processed our returned phones and verified that they were in good working order and gave us credit for the amount stated. We thought we were good and life went on. We have our account set up as required on auto-pay and thought all was as it should be. Again, Google had our old phones and verified that they were both received by them AND deativated for phone/text/data service on our account. All should he good, right?! NOPE! Fast forward to this October, when I decided to look at upgrading my original phone (now 2 years old since it was the only one we didn't change out after the first year) and I want to order the new Pixel 3 XL. I just happened to look at our account in the app to refresh my memory on how many payments I had left and just happened to see that it showed our old phones in there STILL ACTIVATED ON THE $5 PROTECTION PLANS!!! That's 3 phone (all of which have been given back to Google a YEAR AGO!!!) at $5 EACH for A YEAR ... $180 DOLLARS that they charged us to protect phones they accepted back, processed and deactivated service on. I have contacted support 5 times and talked to managers and a whole slew of people with, absolutely no solution. Not even an acknowledgement of how blatantly rediculous this is. They will not refund me or even just credit me the $180. I offered to even just give me free protection on current phones for a year to even it out. I'm willing to accept just about ANY solution that equals the $180 that was BASICALLY STOLEN FROM US through and obvious predatory billing system. So absolutely ashamed of their customer service and without this being resolved I can never recommend them to anyone else. I used to brag and boast about our Project Fi, BUT NOT ANYMORE...NOT UNTIL THEY MAKE THIS RIGHT!"

Cell network coverage was abysmal when on the move (i.e. commuting on the L or even walking down the street). I see there are a lot of mixed reviews and maybe the poor call quality was the result of being in Chicago, where I believe the service is switching between all three: Sprint, TMobile, and US Cellular.

Once at the web site, I'm told that my app is installed. I think I knew that, but there is no guidance at all, anywhere that I can see, for how to install a sim card."

I may have to abandon my old number over this because it's no longer worth it to call google for the 20th time and have them tell me that its definitely not their issue  *update - was never able to get my number transferred off of Google Fi so I had to concede defeat and just get a new phone number."

Since Fi uses Spirint as well as T-Mole (and US Cellular), we figured service could only get better.  We were wrong.  Calls were constantly dropped or not connected at all.  There were known issues with our new Motorola phones that remained unresolved for nearly 6 months, and remain unresolved to this day, but we finally cancelled.  Customer service was terrible.  They said they would call us, and never did.  Weeks later, I'd receive a form email.  I received two or three $50 credits from them, which didn't even start to make up for all of the problems and complete lack of service.  Our phones would incessantly show ""invalid SIM card"" notifications and noises which could not be turned off.  All together, it was a horrible experience, that I kept hoping would get better considering it was Google.  Last weekend, we finally switched.  We decided to switch to MetroPCS which is owned by T-Mobile and uses T-Mobile towers.  We've only had it for a few days, but it is remarkable how much better our whole experience is.

I have device protection and went online to file a claim, only to find out that my device protection was being applied to an old device which had already been returned. I was told it would take 2 days to resolve this issue. After spending 40 minutes on the phone 3 days later I am told that not only is the issue not resolved, but I never should have been given a time frame. So now I am forced to wait, without a functioning device, just for support to correct their own issue - and all this is before I can officially start a claim. And for my trouble they're applying a $10 credit to my account - 10 f-ing dollars. I could walk into a T-Mobile and have my phone replaced the same day. Don't use Fi. It's not worth it. When you actually need support they don't provide it. I've been a customer for years, and I am angry and disappointed at how customer service operates. Edit: If I could score this lower I would. As you can see Fi support contacted me - but when I actually got on the phone with them they gave me the same lines they've been giving me since the phone stopped operating. I am still on the line with them and it's been another 30 minutes. Between phone and chat I have spent nearly 2 hours on the phone with support and I still haven't been able to file an official claim. To be clear, I have paid device protection every month for the entire time I've had project fi. It's literally on my bill that's coming up despite the fact that I have been fighting with Fi for days just to replace my device. Just so everyone knows - don't trust the Developer comments. Just because they see your review doesn't mean you'll get any help on the back end, it's just to make them look better but it's completely hollow. Just take your business elsewhere, you'll be glad you did."

I am also paying insurance every month. and after five months of using the phone the screen just went black and never turned on. It had a hardware malfunction (refurbished phone). so now at no fault of my own they want me to pay again $80 dollars. and they would not waive the charges off. so why am I paying insurance for? What a rip off. That's what it costs them for a refurbished phone. I've been a customer for 4 years. and they rather lose a loyal customer over this? Super bad service. Very disappointing. If I could give no stars I would. UPDATE: On response to the google fi message> I called already 5 times. for nothing, a waste of my time. I was on each call for 40 minutes. and they were not able to resolve my issue. they said that there's nothing they can do and that i have to pay the deductible even though I am not at fault. They were supposed to send me an email to proceed the deductible and getting another phone. They messed up and didn't send the email, so i'm back with them and they've had me on hold for 30 minutes.

When I met the final requirements put forth a Fi credit offer of only $10 was then made.

I will explain why, Now after using the 15GB of high speed if you are like me a heavy streamer this service is not for you.

So I decided to try out the option for $10 dollars a GB I wanted to watch a small documentary on YouTube that wouldn't allow me to at slow speed's. Unfortunately I learned the hard way, I wanted to turn off the high speeds after the 1GB, I can't I'm stuck right now at a total of 3GB @ $30 dollar's Everytime I'm using data I'm seeing money fly out of my pocket I have no wifi currently where I'm at. Remember this service will not let you stream YouTube without high speed data. Good luck I'm leaving this service switching to Verizon."

The support is laughable. I have been without a phone for 4 weeks at this point . I paid my replacement fee and my address was correct for delivery on the GoogleFi website however when they send a replacement the do not tell you that it is all handled by GooglePlayStore so the address they sent the phone to was based off of a partially filled out GooglePlay billing address. The phone was unable to be delivered and was returned to a FedEx warehouse in California, which is about the only piece of info I have received about my replacement from any support staff and that was over 3 weeks ago at this point. No matter how many times you request to speak to a supervisor or specialist they will just ask you to wait for an email for 1-2 days which I was told over a dozen times and not once did I receive contact with any solution to the problem. I have requested they resend that replacement phone or any other functional phone so I could resume contact with work, family or friends but have also received no email about that. After 3 weeks even though I had repeatedly asked support staff to make sure I do not get charged $968 for not returning my damaged phone within the 3 weeks and was assured that there would be no charge because it was documented that I had not received my replacement I was charged the $968 which is when the GoogleFi support person and I realized that they have litttle to no communication with the GooglePlayStore. They just pass the claim along and leave it from there. I have no idea how to contact anyone other than support staff in India with literally no power other than to document your complaint and ask you to wait 1-2 more days."

I have spent HOURS AND HOURS trying to resolve the service dropping my call service. It seems like a complete scam to charge someone for a service they can not use. No matter how many times I told support I've tried a specific task, they insisted intry over and over again. They finally told me I need to replace my new Google phone with another new Google phone in order for it to work. They do not care about customers. They do not care that service drops. they do not care about steps youve taken to fix it already and then when asking for a bill credit ( because you haven't been able to make a phone call in months ) they insist you need to prove you've tried to contact support. I had to dig through my emails to provide proof of about ten people I've spoken to. Horrible,terrible , incompetent service. I plan to cancel tomorrow.

We heard what was said in regards to the representative stating you could have the two promotions. However even with that said you did not actually qualify for the promotion in the first place so as I stated before we can only offer you a 50 dollar credit and this has been stated to you multiple times. Without actually meeting said terms in the promotion there is no way we can offer you $800.00 dollars in credits.

I originally signed up for Google Fi in 2018, but wasn't able to finish the setup because I was in japan and needed to physically be in the United States apparently (which while i think it's silly was fine). When I got back around to trying again on 10/17/2019 because I forgot about it I requested that they reset it so that I could finish my setup with correct and up to date information. Along with some other things I was having issues with. She ignored that request all of the times I brought it up. She even removed the old number then started acting like my account wasn't associated with a phone number or carrier at all and didn't know that I had a new number I needed to keep. Even though I stated it multiple times through out the conversation, sometimes as a result of a question she asked. At one point I thought maybe chat is automated. Once I reached the point where I was done trying to explain what I was asking for and having her ask for something I said more than once. I asked to be disconnected. I had to ask 3 times. Before you go why didn't you disconnect your self - It doesn't let you. It just keeps reconnecting you. Over and over and over again. Apparently there is no call support now either. After that I went online to see if it was worth it in the end to go through some hoops and just deal with it. Apparently there is a whole group of people who have issues with payment of all things because of how the technical support is handled. Which is huge because as we all KNOW, google doesn't have a physical location for services. I still love and use google for everything else but I will probably never use Google Fi now because I can't rely on them to fix issues that should be simple."

International calling is finally doable without breaking the bank to use your own cell phone number.  Two items on the wish list. Reduce per GB data cost.

1964,Logan Sinclair,"July 21, 2019",5, How carrier service should be. Great customer service was able to fix and answers questions in minutes. Price for data is a bit steep. Only variable is connectivity. If the service is good in your area try this out.

Now, over a year & a half later, I am totally satisfied with Fi. Tech support has consistently been super responsive & very knowledgeable the few times I needed them.

Haven't seen so many ""!""s and ""3g"" signals since before ATT bought out Cingular wireless. Miss a lot of incoming calls while I'm at home using my super fast WiFi. Often times carrier signal drops out complete and I am left with an exclamation point for a few hours. This would make sense if I lived in the boonies. But I live in a fairly metropolitan area. I would hate to go back to ATT, but reliability alone might be worth its price.  (UPDATE) I have since left Project Fi; however, I hold hopes of returning in the near future. It became one of the best experiences with unmatched customer service. Give it a shot to save $$ on your phone bill. Or, if you just want to try something a little different. They have greatly expanded the device compatibility and their customer service and price is still untouchable by any other provider. Great job. Updated from 3 to 5 stars."

necessary features to track usage and manage your account; it lacks 
excessive bloatwear and cross selling schemes that you might find in the 
Verizon (or other carrier's) apps. The bad: you might not like the service 
if you have something against the supported phones, you don't live in the

like having extra money in your bank account"

They even said so on the phone. Imagine 2 weeks without your phone # and 
email? Don't be a fool, especially when Google doesn't have customer 
service and FI won't do anything about it especially after I supplied them

the representative I wanted to leave feedback on my experience and he said 
""oh no worries sir I will connect you to our survey"" then disconnected the 
call... Also there is no standard voicemail greeting so you actually have 
to make a voicemail message which is uncomfortable for those who want 
privacy. Google doesn't support conditional call forwarding so you are 
stuck with their voicemail service, no more YouMail. For the price and

issue I have is that when submitted an error through the app, it won't let 
me properly take a screenshot for the issue I'm having. When submitting a 
screenshot, it only takes a pic on the bottom of the app page, since that's 
where the support button is located. This one isn't bad but I'm not able to 
manually set my data notification reminder. It goes by 500mb increments, 
from ""off"" to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and so on. I would like to manually put 
1.8GB as my alert but I guess I'll haven't stick with 1.5GB until there's 
an update. Also I really hope Project Fi implements some better deals. 
Having to pay $4 in tax is quite expensive. Adding users to your group pay 
$6 in tax. If they charged the user $5 per gig, instead of $10 now that 
would be a steal! Either that or lower the gig protection. Having to go 
straight up to 10GB from 6GB for two users is a bit much. They would be 
attracting so many customers. Please think of better ways to keep your 
customers Project Fi. I really want my family members to stay with you guys 
but that'll be hard if Verizon is out there having better deals."

I've been waiting over 3 weeks for a phone trade-in refund which I was told via email would occur within 3-5 business days. After I reached out to support I was told they are behind and I will need to just wait for my refund because they couldn't give me an estimate on how much longer. This should have been communicated rather than waiting for a customer to worry and waste time reaching out to support to get an inadequate answer. I am ending my service after I receive my refund.

Fi customer service was nice at first but could not solve the problem even though we got an email that the number was ready to port. Reps would say they would call back in 5 minutes. No call or email. The account number Fi gave us was not the one needed to port the number. Finally, a rep tried to get us into my wife's account and gave the same instructions 5 times. When I replied 5 times that his instructions didn't work, he said ""Well, I can't help you then"" and hung up.

The cost is great, and it's easy to travel internationally with Fi. Calls sometimes get dropped when switching networks, maybe once a week or so. When my wife bought a new Pixel, it was clearly a lemon out of the box, overheating and not able to make phone calls except on speaker mode. Fi sent her a new one, but it took a few hours of trouble shooting before they agreed to do so (not a good experience for a new customer).  Other customer service experiences I've read about are also distressing. I have a 5x, and I've heard from others with a 5x that Fi is no longer offering replacement devices for them if you have device protection and break it. Instead, you get $100 of store credit, which is not very useful for making phone calls. I think I'll stay with Fi for now, but I no longer recommend it to friends."

Usually hit a couple dull spots in the city that are inexplicably dead zones but it's improving. Hope their coverage and quality improves. LTE speeds are fast but the call quality is still sub par. Not crystal clear. And I hope that they can do a data plan that's logarithmic with data pricing where data pricing gets cheaper or buying in bulk?? I'm unsure but data is too expensive tbh. Also getting a lot of ghost calls from random numbers - apparently from switching towers.   Main gripe is that they don't verify security updates quickly to update OTA. This takes forever and I have to manually update my phone unless I want to wait 3 months for a 3 month old security update.

This turns my $700+ Pixel into a nice looking paper-weight in my Home Office where I spend 95% of my time, about 10' from the Wi-Fi router. The cell signal from either provider is very, very bad. But it does exists (somewhat). And when it does, the phone will not use Wi-Fi for calling. Ever! As a result, all I get is broken conversations, missed calls or total inability to make a call.   Yes I know of Airplane Mode workaround, and it does work. I don't want to use workarounds, I want the damn thing to work as advertised not having to click icons every time I leave or come back home. It's not that difficult and the AM workaround proves it so. Seamless switching? Complete BS. As a result I have to forward all my calls to a Skype number which is not pretty, costs me additional money and makes Fi a much less attractive proposition.  All I want is an option to ALWAYS use saved Wi-Fi network for calls, if and when I designate one. That would be a 100% fix for my problems with Fi."

Now all the carriers are offering much better plans for only a little more than Fi, and Fi has not improved or offered better plans. Using just 2 GB of data is the same price as Verizon's unlimited everything plan, and Verizon is a better network than Fi, which uses T mobile. In addition, the Pixel 2 is really unimpressive. So even if Project Fi was a good deal like it was before, you are still forced to use an overpriced pixel 2 that is unimpressive, or go with a cheaper old phone. No iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy with Fi, even though I'm able to use wifi for calls and texts using those phones."

If you are in an area with marginal cellular data coverage, Fi will still prioritize a cellular connection, which can lead to poor call quality and missed calls. With the installation of the Fi app, you lose the ability to prioritize WiFi. So if you are going with Project Fi think you will improve your voice coverage, you'll be disappointed. And this issue is fairly widespread and well documented, yet the folks at Google have yet to address it."
2663,G Maney,"April 21, 2017",3, Ok at best. Was pretty good before the last few updates. Now takes forever to switch to the best carrier Wi-Fi calling works like crap. It is a good deal but if it doesn't work what difference does it make.

I only know that the app is causing the delay because I've tried tons of solutions to no avail.  Finally, I uninstalled the app's updates and the issue went away.  So it definitely has to do with one of the recent updates."

So here's what happened. I'm entering a new phase in my life in which I need a different carrier and different plan. Well, I have an unlocked pixel phone with project fi as my current carrier so I should have no issues switching over to a new carrier right? Wrong! Over the past couple of weeks I have spent days and days wasting hours and hours of my time as well as a sales representative at Sprint and Verizon's time. Together comma me and the sales rep have spent hours on the phone with project fi support. Doing everything they told us to do in order to switch the phone over to the new carrier. We spoke with customer service representative after customer service representative doing everything they told us to do and nothing would work. The customer service representative at project I kept on escalating the situation and letting his talk to a specialist if there and still no good results came of it. We were LED through circle after circle after circle with project 5 customer service and them telling us that everything was good to go comma when everything was not good to go. Bottom line is Project I blacklisted my device and has my device listed as a private carrier when my phone is supposed to be unlocked. We went through the process of transferring my phone about 10 times and canceled my service with project 5 completely like five times. But still project file wants to leave me in circle after Circle and spend an entire year of my time leading me nowhere. I've had manager after manager at project 5 customer service lie to me and tell me everything was good to go and waste tons of my time and then just ignore me once they figured out they didn't know what to do. I spent around $700 buying this pixel phone and one of the main things that sold me on it was that it is unlocked. Well it is not unlocked. If I can't switch to a different carrier than this phone is not unlocked like it was advertised. I am stuck with a $700 phone that is absolutely useless I wasted my money and now I really hope I die very soon. Google and project fi is the scum of the Earth and as soon as I have the opportunity to switch back to Apple I will do so. I would like to take this time now to tell you that you want to stay as far away from Google phones and project fine as possible. They are terrible and ignorant and will lock you into their service while at the same time a lying to you telling you that your device is unlocked. It is not unlocked when I go into the Verizon store and I go into the Sprint store and waste hours and hours of my time trying to switch and can not switch carriers. I have let multiple managers of project fine know of my situation and they never want to find a solution they just want to leave me in circles and lie to me. I don't have a year of my time to try and figure out the issue on your end, I have my own life and Ambitions to go after if I want to do your job I will at least send in my resumé and try to get paid for it."

Since then my phone bill has averaged $40, down from $100+ on AT&T. I travel frequently and now have the luxury of texting and browsing as if I was at home. I rarely use more than 2gb (I work from home, always on wireless) so it definitely works for me. I haven't experienced service gaps that are any worse than AT&T and I actually get much better service in a lot of areas. Customer service is amazing......I can't praise Fi enough"

My main complaint is that it seems to prioritize cellular connection over WiFi, no matter how much stronger the WiFi signal is than the cellular connection. This is particularly bothersome at home where T Mo and Sprint are just short of useless but my WiFi connection is fantastic. Fi's customer support has suggested that I turn on airplane mode and switch WiFi on, that I use Hangouts dialer, etc, but these are just clumsy work-arounds."

There is enough information on the Account tab to see my general data usage, but also a details button for my in-depth data breakdown. No more cellular entities charging me for data that I never used. I can comfortably live off of 3GB of data on the Fi network. With Verizon, I had to pay a lot more for the same amount of data and was even charged overage fees without notice. The Fi network even gives you the ability to choose, in increments of 1GB (This is a major plus), the amount of data you need to use each month. I have never regretted switching to the Fi network."

I cannot advise on voice calls, because I rarely use voice.  But everything else is solid.  That being said, I'm in a metro area.  Rural areas might not see the same availability - or they may, I don't know.  As for the app, no complaints other than that I did not know about the Data Usage widget until just now.  It's in the ""P"" section for ""Project Fi"", I suppose.  Anyway, I was trying other data-use-tracking widgets that used to work fine on other systems, and found they all blew it on Fi.  I guess that's because Fi switches networks so often or something.  But the Fi widget works great, is small (2x2 but I shrink it to 1x1 in Nova with no problem) and gives me the only two things I care about at a glance - Data use so far this cycle, and the number of days left in the cycle.  Tapping it opens the Fi app for ready access to all it's other features.  GOOD JOB!  But they should add a screen-shot showing the widget in Google Play so we know it's there!  :)"

We've used about 1.5 GB of our shared 6 GB of data, yet the widget seems to show us having used more than half of our data. I finally figured out that the circle represents the data I've allotted just to myself (2GB) but the bar shows our total usage (in different colors). So in essence it's showing that we've used 1.5 GB of 2 GB, which doesn't make sense. There should be an option to show either just my allotment with just my usage or the total allotment with the total usage. Showing my allotment with total usage makes it look like we're in danger of going over when in fact we're far from it."

It is good of kind but I left Fi in Nov. 2016 to return to Republic Wireless which works much, much better for me.  Pro:  1. Fi allows one to use the cellular networks of T-mobile, US Cellular and Sprint plus available WiFi.  2. When calling or surfing on WiFi you don't use any cellular data. 3. Reportedly, Fi works well for customers who travel in Europe and other non-US places.  Con:  1. Calling from my home was a terrible experience. No cellular company has an acceptable signal in my house yet the Fi service would default to crappy cellular signals rather than use the superb quality WiFi and ISP service in my house. More than 50% of calls failed at my house. Google only gave me a manual work around to force calls to go to WiFi. Manual work arounds from a software driven company???? 2. When road tripping across the western US I found that the ability of Fi to pick up the best quality cellular signal was hit or miss. To help with this I ended up purchasing Signal Spy and Fi Switch, both which let me force the cellular signal to a specific carrier. 3. Once you install Google Fi you cannot get rid of the app. You can only disable it."

2989,Josh Hunter,"November 24, 2016",5,Straightforward no-BS account management Extremely simple and clean app for managing your Project Fi account.

My main beef is the lack of transparency around the signal switching. Phones using this service CANNOT switch from wifi to cell signals. Additionally, the switching algorithm is jumpy and thus if you are at a location with good cell signal from sprint, T-mobile, and wifi your calls will actually be really terrible as the algorithm will constantly be jumping between them and eventually will jump from wifi to cell which drops the call.   I have a nexus 5X and at my office I get 4GLTE signal from sprint and T-mobile and also have great wifi. But my call quality is terrible.   The core of the issue is that the designers of the software seem to think that they know best and give the user no control over what signal to choose. If there algorithm just worked that would be all fine and good, but it really doesn't. Instead, I can watch during a call as my phone jumps around between 4-5 cell signals producing a terrible call quality. It is clear that the phone has no idea what signals are the best.   Project Fi is cheap, but it does not work as advertised."

3091,Eli Connors,"October 12, 2016",3, The app could go further to breakdown what app are using data on a given day.  I came from Republic Wireless where their app was perfect at displaying everything a person needs to stop an app from bleeding data.
3092,Nick Wright,"September 26, 2016",5,"Love it I love Project Fi. Works great. My co-workers deal with dead zones, I always have signal. And I pay a fraction what they do and no contact."
3093,A Google user,"October 24, 2016",5,Loving it! Switched from Verizon. I was very worried about quality and signal strength.  I am so happy I went ahead with the decision. Perfect service so far. Cut my bill in half.

They will charge you up to 2 weeks after the end of the billing cycle, so you have no way to manage your usage effectively. Finally, for some reason the app cannot be uninstalled. Sad to be stuck with this kind of bloatware on stock Android. A good idea but poorly executed, Fi is just another half assed Google experiment."
3096,Shao Chen,"October 21, 2016",5,If only I had project Fi years ago It would have made your international travel much easier. No more buy and toss sim cards especially when you are in Europe. The app itself is nice to the eyes and minimalist. Thanks dev!
3097,Paul Crow,"October 19, 2016",1, Customer service has failed me when it came to a claim regarding device protection. almost two weeks now I've been waiting for them to process my claim.
3098,Blair Heiserman,"September 26, 2016",5,Best decision ever I continue to be completely appreciative of the wonderful experience provided by Fi.

With up to date status (assuming either cell or wifi), you can easily track your usage, bills, and even get support (with estimated response times).  Tech support directly through the app is a great feature as you don't have to fumble around for numbers to call."

3193,Andy Lai,"August 31, 2016",5,"Great Service Although the connection is not 100% stable via the network, but it is acceptable.  Also, the customer service is ""light year"" better than my previous carrier."
3194,Xander Jobe,"August 24, 2016",5, This is a wonderful app that allows you to see the total fat that you've used for the month. I wish that it were it were in real time but I'm happy with it none the less. It's also nice that you can manage your account billing right from the app.

I went to Europe for 10 days and had no problem!  However, I'M REGRETTING BIG TIME that I switched to Project Fi! Audio, connection, & Apps issues. And when I contacted Project Fi, I spoke to 3 different support people in 20 min and the calls got dropped/DISCONNECTED EVERY SINGLE TIME. They didn't call me back (or they couldn't?) to finish helping me, so I still haven't gotten any help yet.   Issues are something I've never had with T-mobile or Verizon. My husband switched to Project Fi with me and he has the same issues. These issues happen on regular wifi, higher speed wifi (50 down, 25 up), and non-wifi. 1) When receiving the call, doesn't connect & it hang up,  2) When receiving or making the call, they cannot hear me or I cannot hear them,  3) Call drops frequently,  4) When making a call, it NEVER go through the first time these days so I have to ALWAYS hang up, then try again and usually start working  5) Several apps I've been using for several years before switching to Project Fi...they started crashing, freezing, etc, sometimes not turn on at all. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend Project Fi at this time."

The auto-switching networks is terrible. A few times it switches carriers and it is stuck with a lower speed than whats available or worse no data at all.  I understand it can't know immediately but it never switches and It then requires manually switching carriers or forces a device reset to resolve.  I have to believe most people switch to FI because they know where they live at least one of the three networks is really good where they are at.  I think a feature they should implement is that you select what network that you want the phone to connect to hell or high water and do no switching regardless of signal quality (except WiFi).  That way until they get the auto-switching to work better, people like me aren't left with a phone that has no or questionable data for hours on end until we peek at it."

The voice worked good but It would take anywhere between 10 - 30 minutes before I received texts sent to me. Went round with customer service and was sent another phone which did not help. Customer service finally came to the conclusion T-Mobile was to blame.and just said ""well we can have a staff member investigate the issue"". They really didn't seemed like they cared much. It doesn't surprise T-Mobile would try and derail the project I mean they know google wants to dominate the industry and put them out of business. As for the pricing it turns out T-Mobile even has a cheaper plan which gives unlimited data and text for less money hidden under their pay as you go plans."

Even when my sim was lost my phone still function just as if I had a sim when I was at wifi at home. The only time I did not have phone service was when I was driving which is just a few minutes. I get online to talk to customer service and in less than a minute I am attended to. Sounds like a miracle coming from Walmart myfamily mobile, where I have to be on the phone at a specific time and will wait on the phone for long times.  With project Fi, call or chat anytime, someone will be there to help you just like that.  For once customer service knows what it is doing. Since I use hangouts for calls and texts, I can forget my phone at home, get on my computer or iPad at school and I could still send texts and calls."

The voice/sms over wifi works very well when indoors. The setup and management of my account has been flawless and just dead simple. I hope they expand the supported devices soon so I can get my iPhone addicted family members (officially) supported. Also, the per GB rate is a little high compared to some other carriers. The international flexibility is great but I would happily trade it for lower rates."

3403,Kerry H Lok,"July 20, 2016",4,Great seamless communication connection Everything is good from the porting to user experience. If I could get back my old voice number that will be five star. Customer service is not as good as project Fi from lack of experience.

3406,Steve Brightman,"June 28, 2016",5,"Fantastic Coming from Verizon, I'm saving about 75$/mo with two phones.

It's also a little cheaper for me since I'm almost always connected to wifi. Otherwise $10 per GB could get expensive if you are a heavy data user that doesn't use Wifi.

3408,Steve Boyd,"June 28, 2016",5,"Game Changer! It keeps getting better, costs me $30/month, and nobody is ripping me off for data I don't use. I will NEVER go back to the old-fashioned wireless criminals again!!! F You, Verizon! 😁"
3409,Brandon C,"June 27, 2016",4,Great but fix the wifi calling everytime I try make a call on Wi-Fi it doesn't know if Wi-Fi or Fi network is better so it just pauses. Fix it so when the user is at home or work it will use wifi only.

However, since Project Fi also uses Wi-Fi, those service holes get filled in, for the most part. The best bit, is the price. You cannot beat the price anywhere. The entire service is simple. There is only one way to improve Project Fi. Google needs to get an agreement to use Verizon's network too. Then it would be perfect."

3417,Matthew Truscott,"July 19, 2016",5,Wonderful So I signed up for the beta program for nougat and I'm now thinking wouldn't it be really cool of Google to give us fi users OTA updates that don't count towards our data. That would be an awesome perk.

3628,Rodney O Chadderton,"May 16, 2016",5,"Brilliant Better than the average service provider since the user has the power to moderate data use. In this age that we have wifi at every point, it is perfect for Fi to flip seamlessly between signals to provide the best service for the user. Has worked brilliantly since changing over a month ago."

Pricing is actually not all that much better if you use a high volume of data (T-Mobile is by far the best now in my opinion thanks to Binge On) but if you spend most of your time on WiFi at home and at work, you don't have to worry about that, and you get the (small) benefit of using Sprint's network wherever T-Mobile may be lacking.  I haven't once found myself thinking that I have inferior service, even compared with Verizon in my part of the country.  I think I would still consider going back to T-Mobile if they could get WiFi calling to work on their non-branded devices, but having a Nexus phone on Project Fi ""just works.""  And, because I can restrict background cellular data on certain apps, I end up paying less than $30 a month for unlimited calling, texting, and 500-600 MB of data, which ends up going a long way."

It is sad to be stuck with a service that doesn't work , well not really one can always move to standard mobile services, but it surely it is sad to be stuck with a mobile phone that is not worth even 25% of its cost  If option i Have option to give negative i would say  minus 10  Sanjay"

It's great. I moved from T-mobile (unlimited data) to Fi (1GB plan) because (i) I was getting poor network (LTE) reception, (ii) wifi calling wasn't working properly and (iii) I was barely using the data - most of my data goes through WiFi at home or at work. As soon as I inserted my new Fi SIM, I got great network reception. WiFi calling didn't work right away, but kicked in after a few hours, and it's been flawless ever since. I do watch my data usage (when I am not on wifi - for example, when I am driving) but that's OK; and it's easy to check with this app. The only real issue I have had is with ""short code"" SMS. My bank emailed me to say that my phone was no longer registered to my bank account, so I couldn't make $$ transfers using the phone. Turned out to be a problem with short codes. Called Fi - they promised to fix it - 48 hours later, bingo, all good."

The phone and service worked without a problem. The added benefit beyond international call and data availability is the cost savings from my previous carrier. Happy to have made the switch."
4145,A Google user,"December 6, 2015",5,Perfect for Miami Service has been pretty much on par with Verizon in terms of quality and speed here in Miami. Best move I've made all year. No problems at all with my new Nexus 6P. Can't wait to see how this service grows. I know I'm not switching again at all anytime soon. Not if I don't have to.
4146,Nathan Kern,"November 7, 2015",5,"I love Fi! My wife and I switched from T-Mobile. We got the new nexii subsidized monthly and are paying the same as before, but now with brand new phones. Once they are paid off we will be paying 40 bucks a month less!"
4147,Derek Clifton,"November 10, 2015",5,Love it Just left Sprint after two years to join Fi and its been an amazing transition. I agree as others that streaming from Google Play should be included or a some type of discounted usage to not use up all your data
4148,Cindy McEwen-Davidson,"December 3, 2015",5,"Class Act The service and support are unbeatable. And so is the price. If you have a Nexus phone and aren't using Fi, you are missing out. Not to mention the gifts. I've received two... one as a thank you for joining Project Fi and my holiday gift just arrived yesterday. Thank you for caring, Project Fi."
4149,Han Shot First,"November 11, 2015",4,Switched from T-Mobile Easy switch and great service! I just wish streaming from Google play music didn't count towards data usage.
4150,tim k,"November 22, 2015",5," I am loving the phone service. For my area, puget sound in washington, the reception and quality is so much better than AT&T.   I notice the reception even picks up quicker after leaving a parking garage.  GO GOOGLE!!"
4151,Walter Olsen,"December 3, 2015",5,"Excellent I went from Sprint to Tmo to Republic over the last year and a half. Been using Fi now for over a month and it has been excellent.   The service is solid, their price plan works for my needs, and the app is clean and informative."
4152,Jennifer Hicks,"November 20, 2015",5,"Awesome Having to deal with providers' apps have always caused giant headaches for me, but Fi is the first one I've ever used that has a nice, clean interface with the info I want displayed right where it needs to be."
4153,Jared Vanore,"November 16, 2015",5,Perfect app for a unique service Major carriers are left in the dust with this intuitive app. I wish it had voicemail control as well.
4154,Brandon Stone,"November 13, 2015",5,"Love project fi That being said, a data usage widget that updates real data usage from the app would be great to have. Could have it update a couple times a day plus when tapped so widget doesn't eat battery or data itself."
4155,Peter Coll,"November 6, 2015",5,Great for travel outside the USA The Fi app kept my data usage up to date while I travelled through Europe.  The simplicity of the interface makes it simple to use.
4156,Aaron Silvas,"November 14, 2015",5,Loving it Saves a lot of money and couldn't be simpler. I'll never use a major carrier again.
4157,Evan Atkinson,"December 4, 2015",5,"simplicity at its best Great way to keep tabs on my Fi account, which is awesome by the way. I know this isn't to review Project Fi, but service has been working very well in New Orleans and surrounding area."
4158,Alexander Mustafa,"November 16, 2015",1,You can't send SMS messages if you port your number from Google voice If you port your number from Google voice you cannot send text messages.  Support said there is a five day wait before they do anything about it.  Suddenly AT&T et al seem like decent service providers in comparison.  I'm giving it a day then I'm switching back to my previous provider.
4159,Michael Dillin,"June 8, 2016",4, Worked well. Had to cancel because I couldn't cut back on my data. I use 15-30GB a month on T-Mobile unlimited. $70 a month grandfathered plan can't beat it. 😃
4160,Erik Cross,"November 14, 2015",5,So far so good! Just ported my # from T-Mobile to Project Fi and the whole process was fast and trouble free... (Nexus 6) Thank you!

4166,Tim Lawson,"December 7, 2015",5,The reason I bought a Nexus 6p..... I'm impressed with Project Fi. I'm getting good service on both Wi-Fi and the cell networks. Billing and pricing can't be beat.

4169,Christian Fuscarino,"November 6, 2015",3,Google Play Music We should not be charged for data for streaming music using Google Play. T-Mobile doesn't charge for data when streaming music. Certainly Project Fi should not for using Google Play Music.

Both Virgin and Fi use Sprint towers, but with Fi I am finding all these lovely dead spots on my commute that weren't there before. My biggest issue is with call quality. Either I fail to connect, or I can't hear anything, or there's interference, or the call drops, or... You name it. Great price, but sometimes I want to give up and go with Verizon."

It's like a cancer, wait I take that back, it's like herpes or AIDS because you can never get rid of it. So, good luck if you try Fi, because if you stop service then you are screwed like me.

I thought I'd ditch at&t and give 'em a shot. Immediately after I switched over I was dropping calls left and right. Even as I was calling for help I could barely stay on long enough to get any help and to top it off all of my MMS capabilities were gone. I spoke with numerous reps trying to fix the issue and just kept getting referred over and over again to the next smartest guy. After a week of absolutely terrible service I decided to switch back.
4228,Chuck Shurlow,"November 2, 2015",5,Loving it Living in rural Northern Wisconsin was skeptical about how well it would work. I'm thoroughly impressed with the seemless switching from WiFi to carrier service.  Very easy to use.  I may be sold!
4229,Steven Arias,"October 24, 2015",5,Google the great innovator The app is almost exactly what you need for Project Fi. The only thing that is missing is something that showed which network you are on. That's where Fi Spy comes in.
4230,Chandra Achberger,"November 3, 2015",5, Cannot deny I love the fi.  Loving my Google Fi service and amazing Nexus 6p device.  Was able to keep my Google Voice # that I've had for years.

Calls over Wi-Fi are working, although occasionally the dialing takes longer on Wi-Fi .  Open Wi-Fi is shown as secure with a key icon beside the Wi-Fi icon in the notification bar.   The new Nexus 6 is working well and Google just discounted the price by $150- good deal!  I use an aeroarmor case because I tend to drop phones too often.  Nexus 6 seems to work a little bit faster than my previous devices and the switching between networks (Sprint, T-Mobile, and Wi-Fi) works well.  Sometimes you can hear the switch."

I literally use no phone data because I am always at work or home. I screen all of my calls so I keep the cellphone data off which means I use no Tmobile or Sprint. I turn it on as needed but even with it off I get voicemails so I am not missing any calls.  I used to pay 90 bucks a month for Verizon, I anticipate paying under 40 this month AND I get excellent reception in my home so I don't need a home line. My wife did say when I left her a voice mail it was a little choppy so I am guessing if you are a person that talks a lot on the phone this might not be the one for you but I never, ever use the phone; ever."
4424,Mark Washington,"June 13, 2015",5,Great service! Bought my Nexus 6 through Project Fi invite. Thank you for the goodies! Price per GB would be nice if cheaper but ... There might be times when I don't use all GB and the refunds might be worth the balance in  price.

Can't forward my office Google voice number to my project Fi number.  Most of the phones were sold out so I settled on the nexus 5x.  Good phone but they have a lead time of ten days which is an eternity in today's standard.   They do not allow one to use Google apps accounts.  Google on Google non compatibility.  So I used my Gmail account.  I figured I could use my apps account on hangouts which I can but my SMS still comes from my Gmail account which causes me to constantly switch profiles to get my messages. I just ported my office phone to Google Voice.  I tried to forward that number to my Fi account for the afternoon. Impossible. Google on Google incompatibility.   I just wish the Google products worked together.  I long ago switched to hangouts as my default and.  I get the latest Android OS and they want me to use messenger.  Hangouts used to have a widget.  The update deleted that.  Hangouts used to have a streamlined desktop interface.  After the update it is it's own ambiguous window.  Google finds compatibility with everyone else's products but it's own.  Google is its own worst enemy
