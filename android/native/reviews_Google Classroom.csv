Although it may help us learn something, most things won't even stick with us. Teachers assign tons and tons of things, but we can barely even learn, as meany of us are extremely stressed out. Suicide rates will increase dramatically, and many students will just outright refuse to do the work. During this time, we should all be with our families, and not doing some school work while our friends, relatives and other people we know are dying."

Its iberating force for teachers in poor underdeveloped Anglophone and esp member countries of British commonwealth. But if offered in other languages like Chinese, Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Bangla, Gujarathi, Punjabi then it can be used very effectively and bring billions under its use. Its free , simple to use and Outstanding teaching app but restricted by limit of 20 files which can be attached with any post. Doesnt make any sense. Please increase to min 50 files."

Typically, we think of it as the removal of solid particles from a mixture containing both solids and liquids. In this process, we refer to the collected solid material as the residue and the fluid material as the filtrate. Usually, a tool that contains some form of pores is used, which allows the fluid portion, but not the solid portion, to pass through."

It has taken away The To Do List, and has made it very difficult to find assignments, what needs to be done, and what has been done. Just because you mark something complete, doesn't take it off your list. It's very confusing, and causes a great deal of repetitive work."
6150,Atypical Girl,"September 8, 2018",1, The newest version has a problem regarding the classwork page. My teacher has issued a classwork and the pdf inside can be opened in IOS but not Android and also the work is shown on the page of stream in IOS but not Android. Please fix it quickly and I will give you 5 stars back.
6151,Kathy Tedja,"September 8, 2018",5," Honestly i downloaded this app because my teacher use google classroom for assignments. But it has nice features, I could see the deadlines, teacher notes, and the best part is i could cancel assigning it and re-assign. Please don't delete any features, all perfect."
6152,David Weitzman,"September 8, 2018",2," With its latest update, it has removed the to-do list, and several other parts of the program that made it very easy to use. It is now very complex, you have to search through numerous things to find what to do. Very poor upgrades."
6153,A Google user,"September 6, 2018",5," I'm in 6th grade and i have this for all my periods in case I miss school or something to catch up. It really helps when I dont understand things in class. Also I dont get why people are saying this is boring. I mean, its school ofc it's boring."
6154,Lala Lila,"September 4, 2018",3, Idk but its pretty laggy especially when you open the app on browser. hope you guys could make it easier for the website version since my teacher always sends link and videos
6155,A Google user,"September 10, 2018",5, I am an 8th grader and my school has been using this website/app forever. It really helps me organize my work and makes it easier to know what I've done and what I haven't. It is an excellent educational app.
6156,A Google user,"September 6, 2018",5," This app is amazing. I'm a student myself, and J love the easy access to my work when I do not finish, or have missed a day. It is such a stress free way to let your students have an overlook of their assignments."
6157,Ta'Lia renee,"September 4, 2018",5, It helps alot with school work and you can long in and see what is missing and print it out or if your out catch up on noted that teachers post
6158,Kitty Kiyomi,"September 5, 2018",3," Info is ""outdated"". Will add a star to review once this is fixed. Refreshing/updating doesn't work either."
6159,Ken Reinhart,"September 7, 2018",1, This app depends on school teacher sending an invite to install the app. The teacher has no ability to provide support when the app does not link to his class. So far useless.
6160,Melody Liu,"September 4, 2018",5, Keeps telling me to update to the new classroom but the app is on auto update and there’s no button here to update the app. EDIT: Reinstalled and it works now.

6226,Crazy_ Kidz_101,"August 27, 2018",5, People keep saying this app is boring this app is not made for your entertainment. It is made to help keep track of school work and overall for teachers to use less paper and just give online assignments and I find that amazingly helpful.

for about a day, then Google took it away again. My Google calendar went 
empty. 2) I wished I could have ""Classwork"" but that was and still isn't

was too late to change it."

on it."
