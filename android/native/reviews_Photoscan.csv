It works better than the built in scanner in Google Docs even with its updates. The app hasn't been updated since 19 Apul 2019 so PLEASE Google don't let another really great but little known app fall disappear into the Google abyss.

When you scan an old picture, it doesn't allow you to specify when was taken to our even add any other note to it. Everything gets saved with the date and time you scan the picture. I still like and recommend the app, but wish this issue gets addresses."

And please add an option to share scanned images in the app after selecting multiple images. And please turn off the auto rotate feature or atleast an option to toggle it.

And please add an option to share scanned images in the app after selecting multiple images. And please turn off the auto rotate feature or atleast an option to toggle it. I'm happy that it doesn't say ""Scanned by PhotoScan"" at the bottom of the image."
3,Mike Birch,"February 15, 2020",5, App works wonderful. I had several photo albums that I wanted digital. They would have been impossible to take them apart without ruining them and the album pages were too big to use a flat bed scanner. With good lighting I was able to scan and crop the pages and they turned out as good as original.
4,Peter Quinn,"April 10, 2020",3, I want a great and fast photo copying app but this is worse than just taking a photo. It takes 4 clicks and 4 alignments for 1 photo. It doesn't always get the whole photo. It uses your flash draining the battery. It usually saves you cropping. Yes it does a job but is hard work.

I like the concept of merging 4 pics to remove glare (works partially) and getting a straighter image, but with the low resolution it's not useful."
7,Jasmine Voncina,"February 17, 2020",1," This app does not remove glare from photos, no matter how many times I've tried. Flash on or off, multiple lighting settings. Every time a photo finishes processing, all I'm left with is the initial photo taken in the app. And before it's suggested, I definitely have glare removal switched on."
8,Roger Aldrich,"March 2, 2020",4, I have scanned over 600 family photos mostly from the early 1900's and before. It works well once I figured out the optimum placement of the photo and light settings. I am still getting some with glare but I can usually scan a second time and avoid it.
9,Beliza S,"April 20, 2020",5, I don't own a scanner and have always had trouble taking pictures of tangible photos in order to share them with others. This app is easy to use and divers amazing quality. Great job!!!!
10,Raymond Baker,"April 6, 2020",1," Horrible app! More often than not the image quality is far worse and blurrier than just using the regular old camera. Also, it automatically crops out important parts of what I'm trying to scan. The app is a waste of time."
11,Shervin Moradpour,"February 14, 2020",1," App is fine, just came all the way here to say, screw you guys for putting an unskippable intro on the app, I'm an old user, had a fresh install, just need to get in the app, and every time I try to skip demo or back out of it, it starts from scratch.... Frustrating to no end"
12,Devan Louise,"April 21, 2020",1, This is just not functional as a photo scanner. Just produced a very low quality digital photo of the print I wanted to scan on the surface it was placed on. Really of no use unfortunately.
13,Rajesh Kumar,"April 27, 2020",5," Wonderful. No shine, no glare, no reflection at all. No cropping is needed. This is very useful to convert hard copies of photos to digital copies."
14,Morgan Armitage,"February 21, 2020",5, This app is amazing! Amazing amazing amazing. Instead of costing me $3 per photo to get a copy made I scanned them with this app and got them printed for about $0.12 each. The quality is awesome and it's super easy to use.
15,Andrew Turincio,"March 25, 2020",2," Not very intuitive and cohesive. I would prefer the documents I scan to save in a separate folder apart from my main pictures, for organization purposes and so I can control it uploading to the cloud. Also when selecting multiple images, only option is to delete. Would like a share option too."
16,Mr Claude,"April 3, 2020",2, Good app used a lot work well deserve 5 star but there is a lack.... How to save easy photo scanned with program? When developers will add that option I will edit review and give 5 🌟. But good work anyway. Thanks
17,Nila Rene`,"February 27, 2020",5," I thought it did a great job for most all of my photos. Some (very few) contained a slight glare but comparing it to other apps, it was totally fixable. I love the corner catchers, makes it easy and very resourceful. Thanks y'all!"
18,Vicki Graff,"April 26, 2020",4," Love it, just wish I could save the photos to my sd card instead of the internal memory. I'm digitizing my Grandmother's photo album and this app has made it so easy!"
19,May Edwards,"May 1, 2020",5, Brilliant app. Was looking for something like this to convert my old photos to digital and this does the job perfectly.

The scans come out so blurry even though it makes you take 5 pictures. I have had apps that take one picture come out better. Also I couldnt figure out how to connect scans that are related into the same file. I'm surprised Google would develop an app this junky"
21,Parth Batra,"March 27, 2020",4," All is well except colors sometimes. Sometimes it over processes but sometimes it under processes. So colors are a hit and miss (mostly less saturation) if you compare it to actual photos. Overall, app is very useful. glare removal and edge detection is excellent."
22,PhïllyMøm 215,"November 16, 2019",2," I used this app about a year ago and nothing has changed. I've always been a big fan of Google & their products, but this one needs some work.

I've always been a big fan of Google & their products, but this one needs some work. The concept is great, but there's so much excitement that's lacking. AND, please take your own picture with this app, and tell me how much attention this app really needs. So spruce it up & smooth it out. Make every picture better than before: Clean, smooth, no grainy outcome!"
23,Charlie Siefert,"April 21, 2020",4," A really good scanner for my android phone (I don't have a computer scanner these days), but for shaky old guys like me it's a bit frustrating to actually get the scan right away"
24,Sam Bernales Jr.,"April 29, 2020",1, Not that accurate. It also scans part of the background. You also have to contrast the document to make the scanned photo clearer.
25,Animator Rahul Puri,"February 29, 2020",1, Didn't found it that useful as What's the difference between clicking the pic of any object using Device camera and using this app to capture the same object ? Can anyone explaine me so that I can edit my review and can give more stars to this app ? If it really deserve ..
26,Dion Beaudin,"April 15, 2020",4," I scanned 4 pictures from the early 70's and the they turned out great. The pictures themselves were definitely aged but when scanned, they cleaned up nicely."
27,Julián Nuñez,"February 22, 2020",2, This is really not a good app. 90% of the time photos come out with glare anyway and it takes several tries to get them glare free / correctly colored. You're much better off using a scanner.
28,Katelyn Ray,"April 11, 2020",4," Great way to scan photos. Just wish there was a soft light. There having a light, and no light. I would like to have an in between"
29,Vicki Holman,"April 16, 2020",1, Basically like taking a pic. Which i prefer the pic. Not as time consuming and you still get to edit your pic your way.

Picture perfect and glare free enhanced digital scans of all your printed photos via your phones camera. Excellent approach/method to securely back up all printed photos (hard copy). The automatic cropping based on edge detection is executed with precision and care. However, smart rotation keeps your photos right-side-up, no matter which way you scan them. Overall, all printed photos captured via PhotoScan are safely backed up via Google Photos."
31,Amitabha Joarder,"February 15, 2020",3," Very good attempt but the scans of old photos don't come out as good as say scanning them using a scanner. Certain areas, especially the corners, are often grainy. Black and white photo scans are much better than old colour photo scans"
32,Jim Hegarty,"March 28, 2020",5," This app works great, took a few scans to figure it out but then I was off and scanning. Works great on just about anything, removes glare, shadows, etc... Simple and impressive."

34,Joan Lowenstein,"April 29, 2020",5, I scan and send old family photos to relatives near and far. It gives us a way to have conversations about family history and also to fill in some blanks.
35,Sean Davis,"November 18, 2019",5, I was honestly just expecting an app that just uses my camera to make it seem like it did something when it just took a regular picture. I retract that.

I retract that. This blew me away. Take your photographs and shoot with the app in a well lit room or use a strong light and you will be astounded at the accuracy. I love this app already.

Once photo was taken and the the spots come up that you have to follow it would say not to tilt the screen, difficult not too. Way to much stress, so I just used my phone camera in a spot with no glare and no spots on the screen to follow. Sorry... It would be great."
37,Ron,"April 21, 2020",4," Good and quick, the quality is moderate, but enough if you want to scan loads in only a couple hours."
38,Michael Mackey,"March 18, 2020",3," The cropping is nice, but the end result is just not the best quality. If I simply take a photo of my photo it looks significantly sharper than the final processed image using this app."

BEST AND ONLY PHOTO SCAN APP I KNOW OF THAT CAN REMOVE THAT GLARE!!!!
40,Jake Gutteridge,"April 5, 2020",2, For most of the time it does not work properly. I find that the 'scan document' feature on Google Photos is much more useful for saving photos to your phone.

However, resolution is bad. This app should use the combined photos to create an image that is higher resolution and higher quality than is possible with the normal camera app. Instead, the resolution is low and there are unacceptable artifacts visible when zooming in."
42,JellyKit,"February 26, 2020",3, I thought that you can scan your old photos and make it really on your phone because all I have is I can old photos with some break on it. 3 out of 5 because they can recover some photos but at least they can scan it.

44,J P,"December 5, 2019",4," The app removes glare sometimes, but not others. (I think it may have something to do with how distant the source of the glare is.) The big problem with the app is that it often cuts off the edges of an object... it tries to crop automatically, but often cuts off too much."
45,Rehan Mustafa,"February 21, 2020",5, Excellent app for scanning your old pictures and keeping their digital copies. Really impressed with the results. Wasn't expecting glare removal to be this good for a phone app.
46,iinsaayn,"February 17, 2020",5, Great app. There's no problem with the intro...showed once then never again. Took a photo in the dark and made it look normal. Nice. Thanks
47,Dr. Halil Can Gemalmaz,"March 21, 2020",5, Great app to be used as an alternative to photo-scanning. It works great for detailed photographs and text documents. This program handles light glare and dimensional image distortion problems.
48,Jesse Walker,"February 20, 2020",5," Works well, fast and easy to use. I wish it would let you edit the Exif data to set the date taken per the original picture."
49,Mary Anne Graf,"April 24, 2020",1, Just doesn't work. Cannot move the outlined circle over the filled in circles. Uninstalling.
50,Keith Bradford,"April 4, 2020",3, No way to add location or date taken information. I don't want photos from 20 years ago to show up in 2020 on my timeline.
51,Garry Choo,"April 11, 2020",5, Easier and faster to scan photos and documents than a scanner!
52,Amber Coffey,"April 16, 2020",1, I'm having a really hard time with my senior photos. Thought i'd give this app a try. Does NOT take out glare like it says it does and the photos look horrible
53,Piyush Singh,"January 27, 2020",5, It's really amazing! It scanned better than any other app I've used and the quality is absolutely wonderful. I love this app and it scans perfect well in absolute dark conditions as well(that's how I first tried it and it produced a quality image). Loved it 5 stars!
54,gunjan sharma,"February 6, 2020",1," Terrible.it is suitable for scanning small size documents..you can't get clear scan of A4 size documents,in order to keep documents within the frame u have to keep camera to far so it give blur photo."
55,Wil Sylvince,"April 1, 2020",5," Best to scan photos on mobile!!! Only thing, i wish they would make it scan faster without cutting down on the quality of the scan."
56,Ariahna Marie,"April 28, 2020",3," Works great for getting Polaroid pictures on your phone, quality isn't not the best but it still passes."
57,Ben Peterson,"November 4, 2019",2," Each photo scanned upside-down. The auto-crop cut off the edges of each photo and I had to manually adjust the edges of each scan. The images weren't blurry, but that's the ONLY positive thing that can be said about this app."
58,Ma W,"April 11, 2020",2, Why is there not picture enhancement and colour correction features? It would be the best photo scanning app in the world if it did!
59,Kristen Peterson,"April 23, 2020",4, It would be nice to have the option of switching the storage location of the photos from the internal storage to an SD card.
60,Steve Garth,"March 5, 2020",2," Resolution of the finished scan is poor. A normal photo of the picture is clear, but not when using this app. Not worth it if you want a reasonable copy of the picture."
61,Matthew J.,"April 27, 2020",5, This app is so perfect because I have photos when I was a baby and my family and my dad kept them so I wanted a copy of them just in case they get damaged
62,Hector Carmona,"January 26, 2020",3, Great app! Amazing scans! I use it every once in a while. Unfortunately I'm punished for having uninstalled the app by an unskipable tutorial. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I. INSTALL. THIS. APP. Please add a skip tutorial button for those of us that have seen it a dozen times already
63,Adam,"February 14, 2020",4," Scanned photos are good, feels like it was almost done via printer. You can edit the borders as well so you cab remove frames or background."
64,Sherri Rapp,"February 10, 2020",5, Perfect! I scanned a magazine cover with lots of glare and now the photo looks PERFECT!! Well done!
65,vicky mania 007,"March 27, 2020",3, Picture quality it much poorer than the default camera of my phone. But the crop and glare removal works great. Got much to improve in terms of resolution and clarity.
66,Paul Harrison,"April 27, 2020",5," best app for scanning old photos, made by Google and fool proof for getting the best quality"
67,Kathy Wells,"December 1, 2019",5, Easy. Quick. Better quality then using my printer scanner which took forever. Very happy with the results and was able to share some old photos with family very fast. In some cases I think the scanned photo looked better then the printed original.
68,Mike Jones,"December 1, 2019",1," Output result is blurrier and lower resolution than just using native google camera app. Photo is taken before view is centered on one of the 4 dots, so the photo is taken when you are still moving. The result cannot be expected to be anything but poor from this behaviour."
69,Sand Buzz,"April 18, 2020",5," Really good app, it can scan docs producing quality images."
70,Jason Bennett,"March 12, 2020",1," The one time I needed it this year, it got stuck in the slow, unskippable intro/tutorial. Better to just tilt your phone a little."
71,Jonathan Quinn,"March 30, 2020",2," Requires almost perfect conditions to work properly, it focuses too much on cropping to the point it will skew the photo. Needs work."
72,Chris Evans,"April 15, 2020",1, Doesn't work at all keeps saying to move the circle over the dots and every time I get the message couldn't complete the scan
73,Adriana Aguilar,"November 20, 2019",5," I LOVE THIS APP! I recently came across my deceased mother's many, many photo albums, and this app has made it possible to scan quality digital reproductions without paying oodles of dollars to have a professional service do it."
74,Rafi Khan,"February 19, 2020",1," Overall performance of app is good but whenever we use flash for photo scan , the screen goes black and show unable to scan the photo. Please fix this."
75,Rohan malik,"April 19, 2020",5, Great app. Its actually better than camscanner which is a chinese malware according to me..
76,Damien Slob,"April 2, 2020",1," Whenever I tried to scan a photo, it'd freeze on the first circle and then say ""Couldn't complete scan."""
77,Alon RZ,"April 4, 2020",1," Sharing is limited to drive, maps and bluetooth. Nothing beyond that. Not even save to phone. Very odd."
78,Zachary,"November 25, 2019",1," Potentially useful if the resolution wasn't unnecessarily limited. As is, the output you get from this is basically useless as a digital copy, which is a shame since this could be so much better with a higher resolution"
79,Pratik Patel,"February 14, 2020",1, Please add options to make a PDF. Please add options to make where to save the images. Delete function does not work.
80,Sara X,"February 26, 2020",1," Awful quality, extremely blurry. I got it because 9 thought it'd help with glare but honestly photos are so blurry the version with my regular camera and glare is way better."
81,John Hutton,"April 1, 2020",1, Craig Newman I'm no idiot but this app falls far short of reproducing quality results I expect. The methods I've used for a long while producers far superior results.
82,SONS OF DRAGONS,"April 19, 2020",3, Glare free app not working! It doesn't eliminate glare on the scanned on photo
83,Ahmed Hasan,"April 27, 2020",5, Easiest way to scan photos with amazing quality from printed photo albums...
84,Gábor Romvári,"April 19, 2020",1," I cannot upload scans to Google Drive, cannot share via Viber? What a poor app..."
85,Kristen Bunge,"December 30, 2019",3, This was hard for me to rate it offs btwn a 3-4 for me sometimes it helps take a better photo especially in situations that you don't have the luxury of finding a well lit area... when you can I would take pics without the app because it takes forever comparably
86,Andrei Bica,"February 28, 2020",4," It would be nice to also be able to make a .pdf file with multiple page scans, in order to avoid using other application."
87,Ethan Parker,"March 4, 2020",3, Nice idea but the resolution is much too low to be useful. MS Office Lens does a much better job.
88,Curt Beile,"March 20, 2020",5," This is a GREAT app! It does what it says, removes the gloss or the reflection. I highly recommend it!!"
89,cheiapet steve,"April 13, 2020",5, Excellent for saving old photos!!! Just love this program!!!
90,Desiree Webb,"January 16, 2020",1, I need this app for class and it will not work. I take a photo with it and when I hover over one of the dots it starts to load but then freezes and says cannot complete scan. It's very frustrating and I cannot find anything about how to fix it....
91,Slaven Popović,"April 15, 2020",5, Some of old familly photos revived again. This app is perfect for this type of work.
92,Chintan Chawla,"January 16, 2020",4, Its a great app does a magical work of scanning pictures and documents to the very minute details...... never seen such a good technique of scanning..... hope to see the Water mark go(that is why a star is less) orelse it is the best.
93,Robert Ross,"February 11, 2020",4, Works really well. I wish it would scan to PDF without the watermark.
94,Siva,"March 5, 2020",1," I can't do scan, whenever do a photo scan I couldn't find the circle at the four corners. Developers kindly find the solution as soon as possible"

There is one big flaw, though, which is that color reproduction is quite bad if your lighting is not very well engineered. Also I wish it could be used to get bit higher resolution (Which should be possible since it is basically image composition)   My key concern, though, is color. For that what I wish they'd add is option to use color patches for calibration (So have black and white squares next to the photo and use those for black/white point)   Also option to export raw format and can be edited later on desktop would be nice. At the moment I think this app is cool, but it isn't good enough that I'd dare to destroy the physical copies of the pictures."
98,Eric Flores,"December 17, 2019",3," Direct Share is not available So, what is the use of the app if I have to upload, then, download again, every scanned photo. There it lost one star. Then, every photo is branded with the app name. There goes another star."
99,Jeyandran Kulanthaivel,"April 2, 2020",5, This app work great.Some stupids say that this app doesn't work correctly because they need to upgrade their phones.Trust me and download this app.it is a best photo scan app

I get lots of blur and double-vision effects. I get better output from a regular camera photo. I'm using a Google Pixel 3, so go figure.  As for the basics: After scanning, there is no photo adjustment. No brightness, no color, no rotation. There's no way to LABEL THE PHOTOS!? No way to organize them in folders!? No way to choose storage location/card. This seems half-baked at best."
101,Andrés Juan Carlos Ramos Brabant Mateo,"November 20, 2019",5, I have been using PhotoScan for pictures that my grandmother had. Even with photos from the 1920's that were faded have been scanned in perfectly. I'm very satisfied.

The current version is nearly unusable, you have to move the camera around to align the circle in four dots to give reference points.

107,Ian Cummings,"January 27, 2020",1," In case you're thinking of using this for scanning documents, my experience was that the resulting image had the text so blurry as to be useless. An ordinary phone snap produces very nice sharp text so I'll stick to that"

202,Leon Janzen,"October 28, 2018",3," The app removes glare very nicely, and stitches the shots together very cleanly, but the resolution of the final photo is so low that it is still significantly better to just take a single picture using the regular camera app, if you can find a light source that doesn't produce glare."
203,Reginald Barclay,"March 13, 2019",5," This app tickles my geekhood just right. It's pretty nifty for getting a photo or document on your phone rapidly. But as far as picture quality, realistically, you can't hold perfectly still. A bargain basement $30 scanner would blow it out of the water."

215,Korey Hite,"April 9, 2019",5, Amazing. No need to use a scanner to digitize a photo. This is so fast and clear and crops it for you. The app is not meant to manipulate photos. Use a different app for that. The value is in the glare and cropping algorithms.

244,Natheer Khasawneh,"September 15, 2018",4, Good app with nice concept. I tried it once and created nice photo glare free from a print photo. I was hoping for one option which is changing the creation date. This is very important so the photo will be placed in it's right date in Google photos.
245,Anthony Reed,"May 29, 2019",3," Useful but there is no option to edit the date of the photos, so everything appears under the date the photo was scanned, which makes it pointless in my opinion. This should be such an easy addition to the functionality"

251,Jamie Young,"January 19, 2019",4," The idea and app works pretty well. The final product is what matters most, and the quality of the photos taken goes down. The overall photos generally get ""smoother"" but not blurry and either too dark or too bright. Working to remove glare seems difficult!"
252,Brian W,"September 3, 2019",2, A scanner works a million times better. The quality is very low (I'm taking the photos in high resolution but the end result is potato quality resolution). Perhaps there's a setting that isn't enabled but this app could be so much better.

259,Daniel Masters,"January 30, 2019",5," Google Photoscan is such an underrated app. The way it captures and stitches four smaller photos into one high quality photo – and removes glare! – is ingenious. Not to mention, it's so much faster than tediously scanning and cropping each photo on a flatbed scanner."
260,Roy Du,"September 8, 2019",1," Can't select multiple images to share. Only thing you can do after selecting multiple images is delete them. Also, the scanning quality is not as good as CamScanner, it takes longer to process images, and CamScanner has better image detection for determining borders."

264,Dana Renée,"October 5, 2019",5," Yet another marvelous Google product! I only wish I'd been using it sooner. No glare, photos right-side up, and the ability to adjust corners. It's making a tedious and emotional task much easier. Thanks Google!"

266,Trisha Hernandez,"November 19, 2019",5," Wow. This app actually crops, rotates, & removes the glare from all of the family pictures that I'm digitizing. It is saving me so much damn time!"
267,mahima surve,"January 11, 2020",2, Please enhance this version and feature .... It was unable to share it in other app's the picture or make it as pdf . But the picture quality is very Nice
268,Melissa Chang,"February 17, 2020",2, Doesn't work when photo is bent. Scanned photo is also bent.
269,emejuru daniel,"April 27, 2019",4, Quiet good for getting the exact frame of my photos but features such as focus mode should be added. The UI should also be improved to make the app look more attractive and photo editing should also be available via the app.
270,Joel Saacks,"December 17, 2018",5, Just fantastic! I've used it to scan old photos. There's no glar or blurryness. You simply take a photo and then point your phone to 4 points on the photo. It even enhances some old photos.
271,Shreyansh Hingar,"August 6, 2019",3," It was one of the best app I always recommend but since the new updates the flash stopped working when the dots show. For the first shot the flash did get on, but when the dots came it just turn off even in the dark/no lights condition."
272,Mark Attaway,"November 10, 2019",5," Great photo scanner!!! No more need for a physical, clunky scanner!!! Awesome and convenient!!!"
273,Kevin Blythe,"March 9, 2020",5, Gets physical photos in an instant with zero glare. Immortalize your physical photos with this app by turning them digital for life.
274,Sam Hillman,"December 6, 2018",1, I tried this photo scanner app by Google and it was really bad hate it so here's my advice to those of you who are thinking about downloading it don't it's a waste of time I switched over to Microsoft Office Lens a million times better then this rubbish photo scanner app.
275,William Karlsson,"November 10, 2019",1," Watermark on the pictures means the pictures are being destroyed, don't install. Disable if it came preinstalled"

277,Zaribeth J. Pagan Rojas,"March 22, 2020",5, Great app it scan your old photos very easy and remove the glare
278,Sokol Hazizi,"January 10, 2019",3, the concept is nice but it sucks to get a higher resolution picture from just a shot of the photo with my regular camera. please improove resolution! and maybe add a couple of editing tools like white balance and exposure value.
279,Chris van Eijk,"November 13, 2018",4, Very effective and simple app for scanning your legacy photos without glare. It would be 5 stars if the resolution was not set so low. I would like to set resolution myself (high/medium/low) and ratio 4:3 vs 16:9
280,Chris Malone,"February 26, 2019",5," Scans perfectly if you take your time with it. Wont work if you take the pictures too fast. Everything works great and comes out very clear for me. Love that it has no glares or ""phone"" shadow in pictures. Well done Google"
281,Laura Reijonen,"November 7, 2018",3," Love google, but the brightness of the final image is dark, unless it's taken in even light with no shadows from your hand, in which case you don't need a scanning app."
282,A Google user,"September 19, 2018",1, Google I am using almost all your apps and I always rate goolgle apps 5 star ... But this time I can't .. I am very disappointed with Google photo scanner as compare to camscanner and Microsoft lens... So I believe that Google can make this app good so I can install this app...
283,Happy Grump,"January 20, 2019",1," Garbage. My results were very poor. To get a decent result, there's that much fiddling involved with manoeuvring the camera you may as well just use standard camera and play with different room lighting & shadows to reduce blur etc."
284,Tony C,"September 3, 2019",2, OK. This finally worked after uninstall / reinstall. I don't like the way it puts a frame around each photo. But it's easy to fix it by using the editing tool on my Samsung gallery to crop the BS off.
285,Cathy Clapinson,"September 25, 2019",5, Just brilliant. Can't tell you how brilliant this simple app is for scanning old photos. Easy to use and gets rid of glare and shadow. I never usually review apps but this one really deserves it. Fantastic
286,Jess Nakawombe,"November 28, 2019",1, Of all Google products this one sucks. It replaced my iTel plus 33 camera that was fantastic without even asking for permission! I just uninstalled it only to learn that it replaced my camera Just help me to get back my iTel plus 33 camera.  Thanks
287,Andreas Bovens,"December 1, 2019",1," So much potential, but unusable due to low output resolution."

290,Karen Woodward,"December 20, 2019",2," Limited editing allows crop, rotate, and share but will not access existing photos on device."
291,Khush Dave,"September 15, 2018",3," App is really amazing, only problem is quality. I scan really good but at the end quality matters. Google places try on improve on quality. Because in most of the pictures it jeopardize the pixel."
292,A Google user,"December 28, 2018",2," Sort-of works (mostly) but the quality of the final image is very poor (blurry, low fidelity and not always glare free). A great idea let down by poor results. Expected better from google. Will not be keeping."

294,Dominik Sparling,"October 21, 2019",2," Yeah, it gets rid of glare, but it just lowers the resolution of all the pictures a lot compared to just taking a picture as best I can with the normal camera. Not worth in internal storage."
295,Syah Villiers,"November 24, 2019",1, Really bad apps. The pic become blurry when using this app. Taking pic with camera app is much better.
296,Marvin W. Huddleston FRAS,"January 4, 2020",5," I'm very impressed with this app. And I'm a long time photographer, so I'm a bit hard to impress!"

298,Masood Mohammed,"April 4, 2019",5," Wow, just wow! I am speechless. Awesome job Google. It was recommended to me by a friend after my scanner broke. I never gave an app five stars, this deserved it as the EASE of use and the qualtiy. 👏🙂"
299,A Google user,"March 19, 2019",4, it is easy to use. but eventho my camera is good the picture by photoscan is blur. other said b'coz i move a litte during taking the picture. but surely i did not. so i hope the apps will have an improvement (the picture will not blur)
300,A Google user,"October 29, 2018",4," The photoscan part is good, but it saves the photo multiple times when editing the frame which is really annoying, and I haven't found a place to change that."
301,Shrinath Kariyattil,"December 3, 2018",3, The app wasn't as good as it claims to be. The various points at which the photo or doc needs to be scanned makes its more difficult to use. Post doing the same too the scan ain't clear.
302,phil higgs,"October 12, 2019",5," This app is brilliant for taking quick ""scans"" of photographs and does a very good job of removing flash reflections, even when photo is behind glass. Much better than just using your phones camera to capture an old photo."

306,A Google user,"November 21, 2018",3," Super simple process and nice auto edge correction. Glare removal is pretty cool. The quality is unacceptable though - even on a Pixel, the existing camera photos look better than the PhotoScan results. Needs more work."
307,Peter Malcolm,"October 24, 2019",3," The quality of the image is excellent, but it needs options. Set to B&W, export as PDF, file size/quality setting... this is just a start compared to other applications."
308,Granny K,"October 28, 2019",5, Scans great. This app made my pics look even better than the original. Most were from 1920's through the 1960's. My hands were shaking and you can't even tell. I have a lot of work/photos to scan.
309,jusko ko,"November 20, 2019",4, No choice of resolution. The default scanned resolution is too low.
310,Eric Grimaldi,"November 25, 2019",5," Amazing app.. Easy to use, a retouch app as friendly would be great for worn out or down pictures... Thanks."
311,Shoeb Ansari,"January 7, 2020",5, Very good quality of scanning and User friendly (easy to use)
312,Tony Phillips,"February 4, 2020",2, It was great until they started tagging it at the bottom with photoscan by Google
313,Jason Evans,"February 6, 2020",5," What an app. I'm blown away by this, absolutely fantastic. Love it, triple thumbs up 👍👍👍"
314,State Stefan-Cosmin,"April 3, 2019",1," useless...you just can make a clear scan from hands using 5 shots. Always blury, although the hand is almost steady at the first shot, the angle, height and steadyness of the rest of the photos is always different from the 1st therefore the pictures combined will give a blury one."
315,Jessica Cantlope,"October 28, 2018",5," It's really cool! It made a lot of my scanned photos darker and is understandably slow, but it's still vastly better than manually scanning and editing images."
316,LooneyTunes Horner,"March 25, 2019",2," I'm sure documents scanned were in PDF format but now they are in JPG and that's useless for business. I used to love the convenience of this app, scanning and emailing documents."
317,Deepak Balivada,"August 16, 2019",5," I really liked the App, the way and process of scanning the image perfect and the Scanned photos are very clear. Its helping me in digitising the old photos and Sharing those photos with family and friends using Google Photos."

319,Betty Cheung,"April 22, 2020",1, Unfortunately it's not working on my Nokia 6. I just have a black screen.
320,A Google user,"December 31, 2018",3, higher resolution would be great. my camera is capable of much better than the app allows. the premise is excellent but the quality of the photos scanned is just too low.
321,Charles Williams,"December 3, 2018",5, Works great and takes terrific scans! But it does take a bit of practice and patience. I have to admit. Google did great with this app.
322,Natasha Boomer,"September 28, 2019",1, This app sucks. It labels all its photos. It take so long to scan then I and almost longer to transfer from you phone to your computer. EPIC FAIL. What a waste of time. Just buy a scanner. She said to herself.
323,Ram Teja,"January 28, 2020",4, What is the position of having a scanner without sharing option.
324,Hector Fontanez,"May 13, 2019",4," The only thing this app needs is a way to enhance the scanned images. However, you can do that after the fact in Google Photos. For that reason, I knocked it down one star."

330,Kellie Dolan,"December 26, 2019",1," If I could give a comment without stars I would! The one time I actually got it to scan, the picture had a GIANT glare!!!!"
331,Chris Maggio,"December 26, 2018",1," Low picture quality, and sometimes it doesn't work at all. It likes to hang at the first step of ""recording"" the photo and never do anything. I expected more from Google."
332,Danny Hirsch,"May 20, 2019",4," Useful app that works as advertised on my Pixel 2XL. I would have rated 5 stars, however because there isnt a way to skip the introduction on first launch. Please add a way to skip the intro/instructions"
333,Starostina Alexandra,"September 8, 2019",1," This app can't get right shapes of the documents, which are needed to be scanned, even when documents lie on contrast surfaces. Absolutely useless capture of four edge points. Works really slow, results are super bad."
334,Sarah S,"September 10, 2019",5, Incredible! It's insane how high quality the photos are! And it's extremely easy to take the photos. It's a great way to preserve old family photos. Highly recommend for anyone!
335,Kevin Taylor,"January 2, 2020",2, Easy to use but puts a big fat Google watermark and white border around every photo you scan with it.

339,Shaun Storbakken,"February 17, 2019",5, This app solves something that has annoyed since i started trying to use my phone instead of a scanner - glare. I picked the glossiest book i could find and it looked great on the first try. Google should just build this into the camera app!
340,Justin Ebby,"October 7, 2018",4, I liked this app. It's very intuitive. The only negative I find is that the picture quality could have been better and this despite my device having a really good camera.
341,Bajarang Konatham,"December 2, 2019",1, Why the resolution is compromised? After scanning nearly 50 pictures i realised my main camera app produces better pictures!

345,Tami McAdams,"March 24, 2020",5, App works great! Nice quality scans.

347,Jen C,"January 12, 2019",3," Wonderful idea! There's still a glare on the photos I've scanned so far. I expected a bit of a better quality, but overall, not bad!"
348,John B,"November 21, 2018",3," Neat idea, but doesn't always deal with the glare correctly. The resolution is low and not configurable either."
349,casade casala,"February 9, 2019",3," Blurry to me. Camera app produces clearer photos. Perhaps it's fine if you don't mind or maybe it works better with certain hardware. Here, just didn't like the resulted clarity."
350,Bauke Brenninkmeijer,"December 26, 2018",1," The glare removal is great but the reduced resolution, increased brightness and reduced contrast create very ugly photos, often removing a lot of detail in the process."
351,Pete Flaherty,"March 11, 2019",2," great potential and works well. needs settings and a lot better final resolution choices currently 2.7mp but camera is 12.2 mpx . youd figure that you would get at least your cameras resolution,but no"
352,Mário Henrique Oliveira,"August 27, 2019",3, It used to be my favorite app for the job! However now when I share the scans it automatically adds horrendous white borders to the picture. What a way to botch the experience.
353,Sam Blake,"October 23, 2019",3, What puts me off is the Google logo on each scan that can't be removed. Otherwise I would keep it as Google's tools generally work without fail and integrate seamlessly.
354,Mikel Roper,"November 14, 2019",5, Really old photos come to life and look better than the original.
355,Sumita Chatterjee,"November 25, 2019",4, Great. Just add feature to take multiple page pdf scan then this app will be perfect

362,Creative Explorer,"June 20, 2019",1, Why are the 4 balls unnecessarily complicating the scanning and also I see no sense in not having a pdf option in a scanner. Camscanner is the best in scanning. Google should make an app like Camscanner.
363,Shivam Mishra,"August 29, 2019",5, Actually it's useful because there is no distorted image while capturing photo to photo. Also we can use for doc scanning. I'm happy with it's performance.
364,Guillaume Emerson,"September 23, 2019",2, Disappointed because the resolution quality of these 'scans' are worse than regular photos from the camera app. Much worse than traditional scanning. Can't use this app to scan my childhood photos...
365,Jessica Mosteller,"October 14, 2019",2, After taking a picture you have to move a circle around these big white dots.. when I try to do that a blue line goes halfway around the circle and then just freezes... It doesn't save the picture and it's super frustrating 🤪🤬

369,Simon Gutgesell,"April 26, 2019",5," Absolutely brilliant! The scan relies on multiple images from the camera to create the highest quality scan possible, which gives amazing results."
370,Nici Revers,"December 20, 2018",5, Great and easy!! scanned in all my family's super old photos and was able to send them out so everyone has copies. And they are of great quality.
371,Tushar Tripathi,"June 7, 2019",4, App is great... But if it has the feature of scanned pic converted to pdf we can also use it to scan notes and save them. If they add this feature it really deserve 5 stars.
372,Cas Mak,"September 6, 2019",5, Well impressed with how simple it is. Great for taking photos of shiny things like old photos or magazine covers. I guess they coukd have more post scan options but the basic function is excellent.
373,Mr. A,"September 20, 2019",2, I dont see the point of this at all. I just installed this on my old Samsung Galaxy S5 to test out. Quality is poor. Why not just take a photo of the picture instead? Example... PhotScan resolution = 1333x2000 Camera resolution = 1836x3264
374,Ibn Muaz,"December 30, 2019",1, The app should be able to keep the flash on when in use and OCR should be included in it's features
375,Amelia Rieschieck,"December 31, 2019",5, Impressed with the quality of the scanned images. A great app!
376,Augustine Igho,"February 21, 2020",5, I was impressed by the result. Absolutely stunning. No glares.

379,A Google user,"February 6, 2019",3, This is maybe 10% better than taking a photo yourself. At least it crops and aligns the photo. -1 for a lack of options and -1 for poor resolution (compared to default camera)
380,Sara MacKenzie,"October 17, 2019",1," This used to work brilliantly but now it doesn't....after the initial photo, my camera screen gets too dark to see and it won't let me line up the circles...it just gives me an error msg that I'm tilting the camera"
381,Manuel Alves,"December 17, 2019",2, Poor performance scanning documents. For that use office lens
382,Jorge M,"December 29, 2019",3, For a first try was pretty good but it didn't quite scan the way I wanted it to picture still real fuzzy

385,Jaspreet Kaur,"November 19, 2018",3," It can't scan small photos in good quailty so they tend to be blurry. I dont know, it's okay, needs more functions."
386,Word S. Love,"October 9, 2018",3, Was easy to use and cropping was good but in the end the quality of photo was disapointing. Might be ok in a pinch or if I did not have any better options.
387,Sonu Sharma,"July 7, 2019",2, Great app but needs lot more improvement. I don't find any difference in the photo scanned with the app and the photo directly taken with my phone camera app.
388,Laurence gr,"July 4, 2019",1," Imagr results are too noisy. Using just the camera is so much better. Well, the glare is completely reduced but using the regular camera produces better results."
389,William Smith,"August 27, 2019",5, Brilliant and easy easy to scan photos. I'm very impressed with the results. Saves me a lot of time from putting the pics into a scanner and scan them.
390,Abhijit Panda,"October 19, 2019",4, One of the best app to scan photo. With this i can scan photo from other eloctronic device. But it would be better if there is some effect to add to the photo.
391,Akash Jadhav,"December 13, 2019",4, Amazing app . I scanned my all old memory photos due to this app.

400,Kari Ca,"July 6, 2019",5, this app is so great because I dont know how to send pictures from m tv moms facebook to me and I have some of them in a photo album and with this app I can post my family pictures on my Instagram. it's so simple and easy and quick. this app is all out amazing
401,Madeleine Perry,"July 12, 2019",4," Pictures are clear, very intuitive app. The one thing I would like to see is being able to set the date of photos after you have scanned them."
402,Navid Gharavi,"December 19, 2019",1, It cannot convert files to PDF and merge different photos into one PDF.
403,Jonathan Birdsey,"February 18, 2019",2," Pixel 3xl - final picture is overexposed, low quality... just disappointed. Just taking a photo of a photo yields better results than this smart scanner. Great concept, poor results."
404,J H,"August 17, 2019",5," I love this app. I use a flatbed scanner but when i cant i use this. Does and amazing job, even better than the flatbed under certain circumstances."

406,Mariano Tello Nocetti,"December 29, 2019",1," Just don't get it, the pictures get blurrier than just taking the picture with my camera. What's the point of the 4 dots?"
407,Charles Carter,"January 25, 2020",1, Doesn't really work and leaves a huge watermark rendering the photos unusable.
408,Nemanja Borovac,"April 22, 2019",1," WTH happened to this app? I used to get so much better results. Now, it's like the final image is VGA resolution and compressed into oblivion."
409,Omar Zayed,"April 28, 2019",4," Great app and easy to use. Two issues though: colours are washed out with this app, and you can't update location or date of photos."
410,Vis,"April 8, 2019",1," Takes a long time to get a scan. At the end the image is worser than camera shot, not clear at all. CamScanner or camera app is much better."
411,Sundar Ganesh Babu,"February 10, 2019",3, Need to be able to tag a date to old scanned photos. Scanning is a bit cumbersome right now too. Very useful app.
412,Morgan Andersson,"February 21, 2019",2," Easy to use but the quality is not that good, I usually end up just taking a photo instead which ends up better 9 out of 10 times."

414,Landon McNeill,"July 5, 2019",3, I love this app but I wish I could scan as a pdf. And on that not batch multiple scans into one file. This would make this the best app ever.
415,Santhan Raghava,"October 8, 2019",5, Amazing app. Now it's so easy to scan photos. No need to retake it out hand got shaked as it takes video and do image processing to produce clear photos.
416,Atrey Anagal,"December 6, 2019",5, Best app ever seen. It removes the glare completely. That's what make it perfect app
417,Shiam ahmed,"December 16, 2019",1, Nothing special. I thought that this scanner can scan whole transparent body.
418,Bikboi,"March 25, 2020",1, It doesn't remove glares from flash. It's useless.
419,Dacoda Nelson,"March 15, 2019",5, Works surprisingly well and is easy to use. Definitely a great way to digitize those ancient printed photographs.
420,Mahesh Ponnamperuma,"November 18, 2018",5," It's can't imagine,, I can't believe it.. Wonderful work,, great Google.. I wish to Google all the time... Because, it's very very useful... Any other applications never reached to GOOGLE..."
421,slow hand,"November 10, 2018",1," App took the scan pic, but was always 180 out of orientation when trying to view it , whether I was in portrait or landscape mode when the scan pic was made"
422,BEVERLY THATCHER,"October 5, 2019",5, This app is amazing! I can't believe how well it works. It's going to save me so much time scanning old photos. I've never written a review before but I had to with this app.
423,Supasin Tatiyanupanwong,"October 11, 2019",2," Poor photo quality, using regular Camera app provides much better details and clearer image overall. What we need now is basically a cropping functionality that this app has ported into Google Photos."
424,Victor DeSantiago,"October 11, 2019",5," This is an awesome photo scanner! I can scan a photo with the camera flash, or even a flashlight, and the app removes the glare!"
425,Murshid Aslam,"October 10, 2019",4, Hello Google nice app easy to use. I have a suggestion that you add collage option in your update so that the users can scan two side documents into a file instantly and no need of a secondary app.
426,Gabbie,"November 30, 2019",5, Love this app - it has allowed me to bring old photos back to life!
427,Pakbas Channel,"December 10, 2019",5, Amazing but not easy. Not compatible with my camera
428,John Lloyd Rosario,"October 30, 2018",4, Easy to use but I hope you can improve the quality of the scanned photos but overall it is helpful Ive created top 5 advance camera app for android and this one is included you can check the video on my youtube channel AndroidCrave
429,Omar Faruk,"May 21, 2019",4, works well. intuitive and self explanatory. the image resolution needs to be drastically improved/ increased.
430,Logan Elise,"December 9, 2018",5, This app is a lifesaver!! Brings new life to old photographs and you dont have to worry about the glare or background.
431,Lee Shipley,"April 26, 2019",4, steady improvement to this utility for scanning document and artworks mounted behind glass. not perfect but better than anything else out there
432,Muhammed Rizwan,"May 14, 2019",2, The photos taken directly from camera app retains more clarity than this. I don't know the point of taking multiple shots.
433,Mateo García,"October 29, 2018",3," It seemed promising and it does an ok job. Nothing spectacular. It could use an update to update performance, has room for improvement"

435,Yazan Sukkar,"July 19, 2019",5," Incredible tool by Google, I can use this app to scan any document or picture instantly. just needs a feature to save the scanned documents as pdf."
436,Michael Cadden,"September 12, 2019",1, The four circles did not appear. The first page was ok but then on the other pages the circles did not appear or was all over the place.
437,Douglas Bell,"April 25, 2019",4, This is a great app for scanning in old photos. I can get through a pile of old photos in less than a minute per photo.
438,vaibhav mishra,"May 12, 2019",5, Very GOOD app with a very good concept also it let you click glarefree images which look like they are scanned. JUST Needs some bugs to be fixed.
439,A Google user,"February 27, 2019",1, Such a Dumb App. It Hangs my Phone. And it automatically turn on my Flashlight and it does not turn off automatically and manually until i restart my phone. Please check this app properly until releasing new version.
440,Ant Glen,"December 23, 2019",5, excellent app. saves a whole load of trouble with lamps & black sheets
441,Karandeep Padam,"January 3, 2020",1," Not good for printing photos, deteriorates image quality"
442,A Google user,"February 23, 2019",3," Good idea.. but poor quality picture, also we need a feature to adjust the picture name after capturing to put old date to see it at the right place in google photos."
443,Ragul Raj,"October 1, 2018",5, I absolutely loved it. It has a cool feature to remove glare. And its cropping is amazing
444,S master,"June 13, 2019",4, it's great only problem that I have is that some time there is a bug or photos do not turn out good but that only happens sometimes
445,Huang Huang,"October 8, 2019",4, The output image quality was more blur than a normal camera shot in my phone. Guess it's for low quality camera phone. Good initiative though.
446,Deepshikha Chatterjee,"October 24, 2019",5, Amazingly user friendly app. Also scan quality is very good. Only drawback is that it cannot make multiple page pdf scan.
447,Mircea Cimpoi,"December 19, 2019",5, Amazing app! Great for recovering older photos!
448,Philip White,"April 27, 2020",5, Very happy with scans from this app.
449,David Rejdemyhr,"January 1, 2019",4," Awesome, however I think it adds too much contrast to the scans. I wish I could adjust this somewhere"
450,k.b.bathma raj,"October 28, 2019",5, It is a great app. Helps to restore our old photos in a digital format. Thanks to Google team for this wonderful application. 😊🙏🙏

453,David Inkpen,"February 15, 2020",2, Photos produced are really blurry and over saturated
454,Siddharth Parekh,"February 22, 2019",1, Never had this level of bad experience with any Google app before. The pictures are so grainy that the actual copy of the photos look much better.
455,A Google user,"October 23, 2018",2," Low quality, has trouble focusing, but neat at glare reduction and perspective correction. Sadly, no replacement for scanning."
456,Mavis Chan,"January 25, 2019",1, used to love this app so mich but i think there is some bug after updating(?) the four dots just wouldnt come up at all and it keeps telling me scan failed. please fix it thanks🤗
457,Eray Erdin,"February 10, 2019",3, It's not working perfectly. I recommend using a regular camera app and crop/edit photo on the fly.
458,Mandeep Singh,"March 17, 2019",5, This app is extremely useful! Loved it! It automatically crops the photos after scanning them.
459,sidharth k,"June 2, 2019",5, wow they are doing great stuff... they now that they are gonna need few extra seconds to do the image recognition.. for which people feel inconvient and are reluctant towards using it in future.. But now look they turned the disadvantage #playing with minds of people...
460,S.M. Khalid,"November 21, 2019",5, Superb scanner i have'nt found any scanner like this. After all it is from my favourite google
461,James Green,"December 23, 2019",4, Nice option although can tend to very slightly over expose if being picky.
462,Dennis Stoppa,"April 1, 2020",5," Pics come out true to the originals, sometimes better. I recommend this app to my friends! You should use it as well. ✌️"
463,DEVENDRA MAHTO,"April 17, 2020",1, Mach the dot missing not the scanner bat good scan

Please could you explain as to why this is. Why can we not choose to stay private."
465,Claudia R.,"September 22, 2018",1," nothing like the ad, pictures come out horrible, with glare out of focus. deeply disappointing app. Don't believe the paid for 5 star reviews."
466,Donald Briese,"February 4, 2019",2," the problem is that the camera (pixel3xl) is focusing on my reflection in then photo rather than the photo itself, keeps comong out super blurry... 😪"
467,A Google user,"December 8, 2018",2, Poor resolution. Enough said. My phone's camera does a better job except for squeezing of the picture part.
468,David Indome,"October 3, 2018",4, The flash used to stay on during the glare process with the dots and now it does stay on anymore so making scans worse. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Unhappy right now.
469,Third Jaruda,"April 13, 2019",5, This is brilliant! blows the competition away! would give it 6 stars out of 5 if I can! very handy and easy to use. saves me a lot of hasle!
470,Piyush Kumar,"January 15, 2020",1, picture quality after combining four sections not so good my phone takes much better shot with its single shot capture Please improve the app
471,Nir O,"June 9, 2019",5," great app. the antiglare sometimes moves the center of the image, but it works."
472,Dean Kitteringham,"June 17, 2019",1," It once worked fine. Now it doesn't get past the initial animation. I've cleared the app's and cache, uninstalled and reinstalled yet it won't go into the app gui."
473,David Foster,"July 28, 2019",5," BY FAR the best camera scanner you can download. all the others use a single angle ti capture,, but PhotoScan makes you caoture different angles."
474,Jogi Vyas,"September 6, 2019",3, This app does not work as it is intended. It is hard to match all four targeteg corners with accuracy. This may can be improved though.
475,Michael Woodward,"October 14, 2019",2, It has some great features but the final picture resolution is terrible. The picture looks really washed out.
476,A Google user,"October 9, 2018",5, This app worked flawlessly with the few photos I tested it with. It seems like an awesome app to digitize memories you could lose in the future.
477,Colin Croft,"March 24, 2019",2, i found it very hard to use and line up the corners of the photo. it was taking such a long time to do that it kept timing out. very frustrating.
478,Mark Carr,"January 2, 2019",1," I gave up after 4-5 pictures. The app turns on the flash, and was not able to create a picture without glare."
479,Ciara Oddminzer,"December 19, 2018",3," Puts an ugly ""SCANNED WITH GOOGLE PHOTO SCAN"" border on your photos. Scanned images are often very blurry, even with glare reduction."
480,Israel Frank,"November 18, 2018",3, Mediocre app...the scanned photos do NOT come out as clear as the other scanner apps on the app store AND this app doesnt turn the scanned items into PDF's.
481,Vernon Dunn,"February 8, 2019",2," it takes a lower resolution image than my camera is capable of, and takes a long time to scan the image."
482,S H,"June 28, 2019",3," not a plus or minus per se... but this app does not make pdf documents. i guess it doesn't advertise that it does, but i totally thought it could. it's only for photos."
483,Rachel Travis,"August 12, 2019",2," The photos nevef loaded or were captured clearly, despite me lining up the circles as directed.I have to say that I was very disappointed with this google product, as an app."
484,Dude Dude,"August 13, 2019",1," Surprisingly, this app only showed me a video of how to take pictures with the phone. there was no button to tap, no options, no UI, nothing!"
485,Prabhat Singh,"September 25, 2019",2," Pl provide card scanning feature such as Adhar, Voter ID of both pages also. There is no option to save document by name and can't send directly."
486,Adrian Zwenger,"September 26, 2019",1, Scanned quality sucks compared to Gdrive inbuilt scanning tool. makes words very very unclear and only uses fraction of possible resolution (using a galaxy s9) can not recommend if the scans need to be readable
487,Rahul M. Prathap,"April 3, 2020",5, Best AI photo scanner. Thanks Google.
488,Gbolahan Iyun,"April 19, 2019",4, The app showed a brilliant way of capturing printed copy of photos whether old or new. I like it...

490,Stephen Fresta,"May 19, 2019",5," incredible photo scanning ability. Tedious to use, but the results are worth it."
491,-x- -x-,"June 20, 2019",5," first rate scanner, links up with google photos nicely too. just scan, edit, and it is off to your cloud."
492,Vijaya Saradhi P,"August 2, 2019",2, Most of the time it gives blur or double lines when scanning a picture. Photo is much better
493,Nafis Rashid,"October 1, 2019",3," The clarity of photos is really disappointing, better than office lens and other competitors, also, taking pictures takes much more time"
494,Zainurdeen Mia,"November 3, 2019",5," Amazing app very cool. Used it for a lot of pictures, it can also be used to scan pages in a book. Defiantly recommend it."

499,A Google user,"November 19, 2018",4, Beautiful app to scan photos. However can be improved to make A4 and larger size documents/photographs easier.
500,Sachin Ganesh,"September 20, 2018",2, Concept is good. But generated photos will be of very poor quality. Office lense is way better in digitizing photos
501,Elisabeth Dunn,"July 11, 2019",1, i might like this with time but it is not intuitive. Even using the guides online aren't helping much.
502,Abhay Chitre,"August 28, 2019",1, Not possible to move the circle in the latest version after clicking a photo so Uninstalling this app. Also there should be an option to scan documents.
503,Chaitanya Tripathi,"September 10, 2019",3, Too much effort for a single picture. Moreover can't send multiple scanned copies at a time.
504,Shane Shipman,"September 15, 2019",5, This is a great way to scan a photograph with your phone. it's not as good as a flatbed scanner but it's much better than just simply taking a snapshot.
505,Dan Daniel,"October 31, 2019",5, Had some old family photos that were to fragile to scan. This app is amazing and took the glare off of them automatically. 6 stars!
506,Philip Thibedeau,"November 9, 2019",1," Intro repeats, can't use app function. Galaxy S8+"
507,Lorna Timbah,"March 25, 2019",1," Doesn't work as advertised. Glare wasn't removed at all. The photo quality isn't good, either. I get a better quality under the same lighting by using my built-in camera app."
508,Supriya Roy,"March 28, 2019",4, could be better if the photo came out in good resolution (as same as my phone's camera) there's much hezzyness/noise in the scanned photos.
509,Danielle Ripsman,"September 30, 2018",5, Never thought I'd want to scan documents. This app is super fun/cool to use. Works great too! Thanks guys!

512,Jennifer Andrew,"October 19, 2019",5, Amazing I use this all the time and recommend it to anyone I talk to about a mobile scanner. Even copies A4 with ease

517,will revell,"July 9, 2019",2, Results lack detail compared to simply taking a picture of the photo. Glare removal and auto cropping is good though.
518,Farhan Montasir,"July 9, 2019",2," Once it was great, But now a days, when i Want to take Picture with flashlight, it seems Brighter But immediately after few seconds the flashlight Stoped and The picture looks Very dark"

538,Joe B,"October 20, 2019",1, Crashes when flash is on. Galaxy S5 on AOSP 9. Works fine if flash is set to off but if flash is on then it freezes with the flash still on and needs to be force closed.

The main area where i use this is to take photos of a monitor or glass-covered image and i need the app to just OPEN AND WORK, not play a 30 second animation on how to use it every time. There have been several instances where I've opened the app and missed an image."
2385,mark palmos,"September 18, 2019",1," Stupid ""PhotoScan by Google Photos"" on each scan! Scanner is much worse than the camera app quality... So what is the point? At least one should be able to save a text document as an OCR'ed PDF and at better quality!"
2386,Oscar Chung,"April 26, 2019",2," I'm not sure if it's because I was doing it at night. When I scanned photos with flashlight on, the glare wasn't removed at all (it was actually ""strengthened"" a little bit...). And when I did it with flashlight off, the scan results were blurry and unclear. :("
2387,Justinius Ur,"August 11, 2019",4, hands down this is the best scanning app I have ever used for pictures scans and that is saying a lot! keep up the good work Devs 👍🏻 (I'm sure it's not easy working in such an immoral company such as Google LLC)
2388,Ian Broadmore,"December 16, 2019",1," Doesn't work tried different settings still get glare on photos, does not remove it. 16/12/19 update vastly improved scans very fast once you get the knack and glare free mostly."

2390,srose sp,"September 30, 2019",1," I tried it again after long long time hoping that they update app and may scan in good quality but still same,my phones camera capture way clearer image then this."

3120,Angam chavei,"August 23, 2018",2, This is just like a camera. There is no option to convert the files it just takes the picture and crip itself that's it what's the point. I thought I can convert it into different files I wanted to convert it into pdf but it doesn't work. Very disappointing
3121,Tammy Burns,"February 10, 2018",5," LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! THIS APP.

The glare elimination isn't flawless, but does work fairly well. With a little tweaking, should run smooth as butter.  Keep up the great work Google!

Really.. nice algorithm, but algorithm is nothing without a proper approach for user interaction. Think what do we want to accomplish. We want the old photos backed up in Google Photos and searchable like any other photo in google photos. If im searching for a photo of myself in 2016 eating ice cream, I don't want to see baby me eating ice cream."
3125,Sandeep Kumar,"July 13, 2018",1," The images come out pretty poor in quality. The same photo when clicked 
from my phone's default cam app is very sharp though not free from glare. 
However without flash too the native cam app produces way better results 
than this app. It genuinly needs improvement"
3126,A Google user,"November 4, 2018",1, It's laughably bad. Pictures are blurred and useless. The stock camera if my 5x if so much better it's not even funny anymore. /edit November 2018: is still just as bad
3127,Jason Willebeek-LeMair,"May 18, 2018",5," This does a remarkably good job of scanning photos. No glare. I even had one that was was a bit bent and abused, and you can barely notice the wrinkles in the scanned photo."
3128,Vladimir Andral,"September 1, 2018",1, Very poor quality photos. Not worth the time it takes. Google should give you the option to increase resolution. I will not be using this app. I will instead pay for a photo scanning service.
3129,Sid Shah,"March 2, 2018",3, I'm trying to use this as a replacement for Office Lens as my primary scanning app on my Pixel 2 XL.  The pros: much quicker. Has a mode which allows you to eliminate glare The cons: not as clear as office lens. Autosaves to jpg. I was hoping that there would be an option to export to PDF.

3133,A Google user,"May 6, 2018",2," CamScanner is way ahead then this. The quality which CamScanner provide is 
unbeatable. Google should really check out their app and try to do like 
that. There you don't need to click 5 photos only one photo is sufficient."
3134,Chloe Flourence,"August 5, 2018",2," App does remove glare but only from subtle lights, so not camera flashes

3135,Johnny,"February 23, 2018",1, The picture quality is very poor. Taking a photo of a photo with this app is difficult. The result is blurred or poor quality images. You really need a proper scanner. I have uninstalled this. A total waste.  Y

3138,DragonPriem,"February 16, 2018",5, Amazing. I've tried to capture map images for d&d in the last and its always so hard to make sure there's not glare and everything's clear.  This did all of that with no setup. Took 10 seconds and was perfectly clear.
3139,Adrian Imfeld,"July 22, 2018",2," Could be great! Easy to use, but the low quality of scanned photos is a 
deal breaker. Also, it would be great if one could set the date when the 
original picture was taken and add a description right after scanning."
3140,Gene H,"June 4, 2018",2," I so wanted this to work. Sounded too good to be true but I was going to 
give it a solid go, anyway. No. There's too much data loss. If you've still 
got an old flatbed scanner lying around, it's still the best way to go. I 
have no doubt technology will catch up, soon."
3141,Stefan Munteanu,"June 14, 2018",1," Great idea, but the implementation is hugely disappointing. The photo scans are worse quality than if I just take a photo of them. Defeats the purpose of the app entirely."
3142,Debjyoti Thakur,"February 19, 2018",4, This app is very good but a bit uncomfortable to use with the 4 dots feature scanning method. I wish Google had added an auto detect scan feature like the Adobe Scan app. It would've made this the perfect photo scan app.
3143,Chad Thompson,"July 22, 2018",4," Just discovered this is an amazing app for saving business cards. I've had 
a stack of a bunch for a while, and a few have been spilled on and are

tell that they were damaged."
3144,Joseph Koch,"June 23, 2018",2," The app is really slick, and I want to like it, but man, the picture 
quality is terrible! It makes no sense why it would be this bad unless the

uninstall. If they raise the picture quality I'll be back."
3145,Sudha Santhosh,"June 14, 2018",1," The clarity is just not good. I like their idea of moving over dots and

3146,Brient Neilson Rebulanan,"March 8, 2018",2, It's really annoying that I have to move my phone to scan. I would rather stick to Office Lens as it's faster and better. Also it got some bug that everything turns black when my flash is on. Currently using an Android One smartphone and the app won't work fine...
3147,A Google user,"August 31, 2018",2," Glare removal works well, but the resulting photo is always grainy and low quality compared to just taking a photo with the phone camera. Quite disappointing, and not recommended for archiving precious memories."
3148,Keshar Hayat,"March 19, 2018",3, Not Designed for B/W Pics thats the major problem. For color old pics it's doing a fair job. Can't edit date taken in the shot.
3149,Cara Burns,"July 11, 2018",3," This is a great concept, but not any real follow through. I have yet to get 
a great picture from this app, and it never seems to take a picture of just 
the picture itself..so you have to crop out whatever the picture is resting 
on, and the cropping process is not that easy. Needs some improvement"
3150,Greg Young,"August 26, 2018",3," Great at reducing glare, auto-cropping to photo boundaries, and pretty good at color. But it significantly reduces resolution and sharpness when compared to a photo from the stock camera app on my Galaxy S9+. I wouldn't use this for anything remotely like archiving."

in the previous version have been nicely automated."

the support that comes with the application machine is not the same. Update 
it is not successful, it's annoying."
3214,Pranav Pathak,"May 19, 2018",5," Great app! It should provide the option to mention the actual date on which

For those people who felt compelled to leave a negative review, there are a few points that that you should consider.  (#1) The app is FREE, (#2) The condition of the original source photo and focus should have everything to do with what you are expecting (i.e. - 110 photo or Polaroid, overexposed with heads cut off and mildew damage probably won't resemble an Olan Mills portrait), (#3) A picture of a picture is a fine alternative.  If none of these points satisfy you and you can build a time machine and recreate the moment, up to and including the resurrection of long dead relatives to hold fake smiles and not close their eyes, then please do and let me know in the comments, until then I will patiently hold my breath until I turn blue.   To Google, thanks again and keep up the good work!"

3245,Karthik Natarajan,"July 25, 2018",3," The quality of the picture detorates and becomes dark even with the flash

When stitching pictures of text together sometimes double vision / blurring occurs, however, this does not appear to happen when capturing pictures of paintings / art work.  I love the cropping and automatic perspective correcting features; pictures nearly always come out with no glare.  It would be good to have an option for capturing art works at high Res and text files / documents at a more optimal file size. At this stage the app seems to do a good job of this automatically, however, it would be a nice option to have 'manual' or 'auto' file size management."
4222,A Google user,"December 25, 2017",1," Wasted hours scanning photos to my phone only to realize you cant export the photos from the app itself, other than one by one. Also when you share a photo there is a tacky watermark from Google. Save your time and scan the photos or find another app."

It has significant problems now with most basic things like identifying the corners of photos (even dark photos scanned against a white background get half cut off).  It introduces colored artifacts on photos, and the ability to remove flash glare works only sometimes.  Other times, the scan is left with a bright spot somewhere.  And because it now automatically saves to google photos, both the well-scanned photos as well as the bad ones get backed up to google photos.  You don't have the ability to delete the bad ones or rotate/corner adjust the photos before uploading to google photos.  You have to go to google photos and remove the bad photos from there.  Scanning old photos went from tedious to double-tedious and error-prone.  Google just couldn't leave well enough alone."

Thought it might be faster to try an app rather than use my scanner at home.  There were still plenty of glares in several of the photos even though it came up and said not to worry about the glares.  Many came in blurry and had to rescan.  Some were clear on the bottom and blurry on top.  Some had very distorted sections in the photos - likes faces.  I scanned about 150 photos in just a couple of hours.  It was simple to use.  The lighting in the room where you scan makes a difference.  I wanted to check what a good distance from the pict was as I am sure that makes a difference.  And it is good to make sure the phone is level.  My phone was almost full on storage, so I was surprised that I didn't fill it with as many photos as I scanned.  I picked this program first to try and didn't try any others as I thought I would be --  spending some of my time just trying out different apps."

If the idea is creating cleaner, better looking scans with your phone, how is that not defeated by adding a freaking stamp to the picture once you share it?? Anyhow, picture quality is very good, and the stamp only appears when you share images directly from the app, so it isn't exactly a deal breaker. I would appreciate the choice whether to promote the app using my pictures, though, since I'd be glad to do it in other ways. A bad move in an otherwise great app."

4455,Richard Nguyen,"June 25, 2017",2," Really great idea, but I get better and faster results from my regular camera app. Have been using it for months hoping for better updates.

4456,Kelvin Lloyd Aranilla,"October 1, 2017",3," It's a brilliant concept, working around glare by stitching multiple photos. A regular photo taken in ample diffuse lighting still comes out better though since the stitched output is severely downscaled.

Glare removing is a brilliant idea, however as a photo scanning app, the resolution is absolutely the top priority amount all the others factors.

4460,Shoaib Ahmed,"November 18, 2017",5, There is a really large space for improvement. As it only scans ohotos but doesn't make them better. Anyway thanks for such a great app. I know the dev team will improve this overtime. Waiting for new features☺️

The only a couple suggestions. Using 4 corner dots when scanning is somewhat tedious, but I'm sure there is a good reason requiring this.

4462,Hetesh Patel,"December 12, 2017",3," Like most people are saying, the app is okay, but the quality of the photos and documents are no where near as good as just taking a pic using the camera. It's produces a pixelated version compared to just taking a photo. Good idea in principle, but quality needs to be sorted"
4463,Brianna E,"August 29, 2017",1," App did not work like it was supposed to. I downloaded this app specifically to get glare out of the pictures before I posted them, but this app did not work at all. My phones camera app actually worked better. This app is a huge waste of time."
4464,Chandan B S,"October 9, 2017",1, Not good. Quality deteriorates after taking a snap of a hard copy photo. It always turns bluish green and unnecessarily brightens the image making it look like a glossy artificial.  Default cqmera does a better job if you evade the flash on the photo.

When they are actually just waiting for the garbage.    It's nice that Google made this app to super easily file away those pictures that if you're honest, you'll admit you'll probably never look at again anyway.

4467,Matt Mifsud,"September 23, 2017",2," Poor quality resolution. Perhaps this was designed for the Google Pixel devices with the better camera, but definitely not for any other phone.

4468,Kari Sloan,"May 21, 2017",1," I tried one pic. I tried it 7 times. It did not remove the glare, and the best job it did, it made it look like my face had been taken over by an actual demon.

4469,Patrick Baker,"October 16, 2017",3," It's a cool idea and it works, but the pictures come out looking faded and blurry.

4471,Michael Z Rork,"December 11, 2017",2," The images look fine on my cell phone, but with any amount of zoom they look incredibly pixelated. I threw a few up on my Chromecast and looked horrible. A scanner would be much better, even though it takes longer."

4479,Adrian Colley,"December 10, 2017",3," So close to perfect! It removes glare but not shadows. It frequently leaves ghost images where it failed to account for perspective when assembling from four parts. But when it works, it's great."
4480,Josh Smith,"July 13, 2017",5," I love this app, I wish it didn't watermark the picture but I love the glare reduction feature, and that even though they aren't the sharpest resolution possible, the text is crisp and clear, ALWAYS.

4481,Craig D,"June 14, 2017",1," Doesn't remove glare. I ensured the glare feature and camera flash were turned off, but still got a reflection back from the glass of the picture frame I was scanning. Scans are also poor quality."
4482,Manchester United,"December 13, 2017",1," I downloaded it and couldn't even scan a single thing, because it is so complicated to use. So went back to already trusted Camscanner which is simply flow less. I mean Camscanner is so great that I prefer it over real/professional scanners."
4483,Dawkins Dog,"December 3, 2017",3," Works well enough but insists on adding a border with ""PhotoScan by Google Photos"" at the bottom, which I cannot see a way of disabling and is hardly ideal.

4484,Yi Xuan Tan,"May 4, 2017",4, THE app I've been waiting for since before it was even announced. Wanted to make one myself but lacked neural network expertise. This is arguably the best phone scanner app out there!
4485,Michelle Allred,"June 21, 2017",1, This app is very disappointing.  The photo quality is very poor.  Images aren't sharp but instead appear blurred and washed out.  Taking a photo of a photo and cropping it produces much higher quality results.  I'm uninstalling this app.

And during glare removal process I've to manually turn on flash when scanning over four dots. If I don't do so then photo turns out pitch black.

Also to achieve Flawless results you must have a camera that is higher than 8 megapixels if not you will receive crappy results the camera I used was a 16 megapixel that is in my Galaxy Note 5 and it's flawless

4577,Joseph Sarro,"October 12, 2017",1, You're holding the phone trying to scan a picture and it wants you to roll the circle over all 4 dots. Sometimes I think monkeys are running Google.
4578,Kerri Grant,"October 14, 2017",1, It doesn't remove glare at all. Very bad.
4579,Viren Shah,"June 21, 2017",2, It's good for scanning the photos without glares and bright spots. But the quality of scanned photos are not good. There are no options also to change the quality settings also.
4580,Brian Sylvester,"June 21, 2017",5," This takes digitization to a whole new level, super simple and fast. Photos from a Polaroid (in my eyes) even look better than the original."
4581,Kayla Adkins,"April 29, 2017",1, I scanned my photo several times and all it looks like it did was take a normal picture. Glares and my table included.
4582,Simon Hearn,"August 16, 2017",1," Nice idea, however it's effectively useless as once scanned, the only thing to do with it is to share it and it crashes everytime without fail."
4583,RETROnuts,"July 23, 2017",3, It's OK but it keeps showing glare from the photo it's taking I have tried 5 times now and it's the same and some of the photos look blurry.
4584,saurav mishra,"April 28, 2017",1, takes a lot of time in scanning also it is not glare free as it claims and photos are not very clear plus one cannot adjust the size of frame accordingly
4585,Benjamin Shepherd,"May 8, 2017",3, Tedious to use and provides inconsistent results. Don't bother with this if you already know how to use image editing software.
4586,Brandon Clifton,"November 6, 2017",5, Fan freaking tastic app here! Pro scans woth your phone and not a huge lazer jet or w/e?!! I say heck yeah! And it does deliver phenomenal results!!! Great job on this. The designer needs a raise. Js
4587,Goutham Soorya,"November 13, 2017",3, Get rid of the stamp. It defeats the purpose. I would rather have a glare than a stamp around my photo
4588,Gerardo Gomez,"April 23, 2017",4," Impressive, first time I used it I was amazed, the color is not perfect but is very close to be. I would actually give this one. 4.5"
4589,Thomas Bernhardt,"July 18, 2017",2," The app tells me to move the four dots to the circle, when I do this it says don't tilt the phone. What gives ???"
4590,Johnnie Gray,"May 1, 2017",2," Nice idea with the glare removal but really disappointing quality. Always shadows and highlights blown, low resolution, colour off."
4591,REJ,"August 20, 2017",5, Absolutely great app.  Truly impressed and it does exactly what it says.  Amazing at how there is not one ounce of glare and the pic looks beautiful and professional.  Works very well on my phone and I would highly recommend this app!!!
4592,Leonidas Tsaousis,"July 13, 2017",5," Excellent quality, very useful tool! Hats off for the ease-of-use. Especially less tech savy people need it the most and can now make the most of Google Photos"
4593,Stephen Farquhar,"May 27, 2017",3," Doesn't have auto edge detection which would be so simple to add.,which considerably slows the process. See how CamScanner does it."
4594,Steven Hill,"May 19, 2017",1, For whatever reason every photo i scan turns out black .... you can't see anything at all
4595,Melanie Caudillo,"May 20, 2017",5," I thought an App like this should be invented but I couldnt afford 5o invent it Respectfully, Melanie"
4596,ada tiangco,"October 7, 2017",5, I'm enjoying this app. I recently found an old photo of my mother's friend from 1998 and she said she wanted to show it to her friend. I downloaded this and used it. Amazing!
4597,Darrell Spradlyn,"July 27, 2017",2," Maybe it works well with documents, but with photos it changes the colors and the resolution is pretty bad."
4598,RAJENDER PATEL,"March 11, 2018",3, works great but quality of photos are not as expected. microsoft's officelens is better than this and it works in single click.
4599,Phil Whistlecroft,"April 21, 2017",5, Makes scanning convenient. Sit in your comfy chair while watching the rugby on tv and still produce quality scans quickly (on my S7). Loving it. And free. Thanks Google.
4600,Jason DePew,"July 16, 2017",4," Revolutionarily new way of scanning photos into your phone. Bada$$!!! 4* because the photos that I scanned, I think, could be rendered a bit clearer. As I further try this app I will probably​ give 5 stars."
4601,Chris Parker,"May 20, 2017",3," This app can't be installed if you change your DPI settings. That's a bit silly, isn't it?"
4602,dangzlamz Lamare,"May 22, 2017",1, Don't download.. I can't barely see the pic 😅😅 it's better to use your camera instead of this useless app

4611,Soul Annihilator,"November 14, 2017",1, I'm getting pretty bad results scanning my old pictures and the pictures are even better with my default camera. Uninstalled.
4612,John Jarvis,"November 5, 2017",1, Very low quality scans. You're better off just taking a picture & cropping the edges.
4613,Mahan Shukla,"October 2, 2017",5," Great idea, nice app. I'm impressed with quality of the results on my Samsung galaxy j7 prime & moto z play . I'm also using it on my iPhone. Recomonded for everyone."

4615,Ane-Marie Dieng,"July 4, 2017",2, Such a waste to download. Pics either come out low quality or distorted.
4616,Asylus 99,"November 17, 2017",4, Gets out the glare and keeps colors well but in some pics it will add some pixels.
4617,Светов Николай,"April 23, 2017",3, Unpredictable photo resolution. Vary from 2 megapixels to 8. No way to estimate resolution before export.
4618,Nived Kannada,"April 21, 2017",3, Very helpful for digitalization of documents. But we should be able to capture the max resolution available or it's useless.
4619,chinmoy chakraborty,"June 21, 2017",1, The picture lose all of it's clarity and becomes sort of gloomy. Better to use the default camera app

4627,Chuck Russell,"June 5, 2017",5, Awesome for reproductions. In most cases my original was inferior to my scanned coy.
4628,A Google user,"October 10, 2017",5, For the developers: I don't know if you are aware that this app works wonders for regular photography! You should compile it in Snapseed or Google Camera!

4637,NewTube,"June 21, 2017",1, Very bad app  dot moving is annoying CamScanner is far better than this.

4666,Joe Willets,"November 5, 2017",2," Interesting idea, but each ""scan"" is worse than every normal photo.  Can't imagine who would actually use it"

5487,Robert Scott,"March 12, 2017",5, Great easy to use scanner. You must take your time and not shake during the scan for quality pictures.

Not sure why so many users are complaining about quality?   I scanned a picture from 1972 and it looks 100% better than the original. The Orignal was all cracked & faded but the scanned image looks great no signs of the cracks. I think of you just take your time the pictures scan better than the original.
5488,A Google user,"March 11, 2017",3," I'm having a problem where my flash turns off when it should stay on while going over the white dots which is causing the glair to stay and not go away,  anyone can help, the app is useless without gd lighting in this case...  I tested it out on other phones and they don't have the problem so..."
5489,Jonathan Nelson,"April 11, 2017",3," Very easy to use. Just line up the dots and you are set. The ability to remove glare is very impressive. Not impressed with the resolution, however. Images can out rarely blurry. I still recommend using a good lighting setup and a standard camera app."

Maybe this has been tested on a Pixel phone, but I have the Google Nexus 5X and the photos look terrible. With taking 4 pictures, I should get an even higher resolution than by just taking one. Nope. Turns out worse than if I just took a regular picture."
5491,Neil Schreiner,"March 16, 2017",5," Works pretty well. Depending on the lighting conditions the quality of your phone camera turning the flash on or off helps the picture quality. Also, if the photo curls up on the side(s) at all this app may show show an edge or two but you can't really blame it for that."
5492,John Eckerdal,"March 31, 2017",2," The idea is good but the image quality both in terms of color reproduction and sharpness is borderline terrible. Image size of the scanned image is also way too small. I would not use this as a replacement for a proper photo scanning solution.

Image size of the scanned image is also way too small. I would not use this as a replacement for a proper photo scanning solution.  I notice that ""high end"" devices get better resolution. Why not let the end user select if high resolution is wanted?  The app is still basically useless for scanning photos for most devices as long as not more phones are supported."
5493,Vinith WinIt,"April 16, 2017",2, Microsoft office lens is way better. It allows us to capture and save full resolution photos. But office lens can't eliminate flash light glare. This app lets pixel phone to capture full resolution. Sadly I had Redmi 3s prime only.
5494,Paul Nunes,"March 10, 2017",4, I've had pretty good experiences with this app. It's fast and in most cases the results are acceptable. I've backed up a huge amount of family photos from my grandmother and I believe I would not have been able to do that we'll without this app.
5495,Franz Wilhelmstötter,"March 11, 2017",1, The app tries it to hard optimizing the photo. Results look very unnatural. Finding the right picture borders and its orientation is excellent. It's a pity that the resulting bad image resolution/quality makes it unusable.
5496,M B,"March 22, 2017",3," The idea is a good one but the performance is sub-par. If u take a pic with your normal camera it'd come out with much better resolution but maybe more glare. If you take it with this app the corners are perfect, no glare, but the quality is meh."
5497,A Google user,"March 17, 2017",1," This app is a cool concept, but the execution is abysmal. Suffice to say, don't bother downloading this app because it is utterly and entirely useless.

The images you scan fail to remove glare and they are only 2 – 3 megapixels. My phone normally takes photos at over 12 megapixels. You can distinctly see the pixelation on your phone screen without even zooming in. The photos are so low res that you're better off not even bothering to scan them at all."
5498,A Google user,"March 31, 2017",1," ""Don't worry about the glare."" It's a big blurry mess covered in glare and my reflection holding my phone. Not quite ripe yet, Google. I'm better off with my regular camera."
5499,Eric,"November 2, 2017",2, It used to be good for scanning photos and documents. Not as good any more and they added their logo to my documents so hard pass now. Sad I'll have to look for other apps.
5500,Frazer Brunton,"February 26, 2017",2, I've had much better results just snapping a picture of a picture. It took 5 crystal clear images and made them so blurry I couldn't really make anything out. It's a good idea that needs another year of rnd or something.
5501,Mahdi Hasheminejad,"March 13, 2017",2," Great idea, terrible implementation! The quality of the photos is terrible. I'd rather use office lens or even my stock camera which is far better than this"
5502,Christine Bobal,"March 8, 2017",2," The quality of the photos was worse than when I just took a picture of the picture. (I have an HTC One M9.) Sometimes the app did reduce glare, but sometimes it didn't. Overall it was too much work for low quality pictures, and I will just go back to photographing photos."
5503,Trafton,"March 28, 2017",2, Photos were of low quality. Had better luck taking a photo and cropping.  Sections of photo did not align properly. App needs to allow input of photos as my native camera app on my Nexus 5 takes much nicer photos than this app does. It had trouble focusing.
5504,Scott Griffis,"March 28, 2017",5," Great way to digitize old photos. Also, I love that I can use it to save my kiss's artwork. Things that I might have once thrown away to keep the house clean can be digitized and saved."
5505,surya karthik,"March 24, 2017",5, Really awesome..  It's the merging of edges is soo perfect 👌.. and performs exactly like a scanner  Best of all the photo scanners I've used  Just try once and I'm sure you will fall in love with it..  Thanks for the application ☺️
5506,Kyle Ferguson,"March 21, 2017",3," The resolution is pretty bad. It gets all the colors pretty well and the shape without distortion, but it's way pixelated compared to the photo and a normal picture"
5507,Andreas Weigl,"April 3, 2017",5, Awesome app that helped me to take a lot of family pictures with me when I moved from Germany to Canada. The only thing that is missing is color correction of really old photos. Those that slowly turned red.
5508,Marcus Ong,"April 6, 2017",5, Must be commended on technology used. This is not a simple app. The outcome has higher resolution as verified with normal scanner apps. Clarity of course depends on the source photos and this app brings the difference closer than before.
5509,John M. Williamson,"March 18, 2017",3," Meh. Not a great solution for scanning old photos. I suppose it's slightly better than what's available, but it does not always eliminate glare and focus is hard to control."
5510,Jessica Peragine,"April 20, 2017",1," DOES make glares, with or without flash. Camscan is a better app for scanning then this awkward attempt. Takes too long, you can't get into the dots easily like it demonstrated, etc. Skip this Google app, there's others out there."
5511,A Google user,"February 26, 2017",4," I really like the concept.  I wish it could capture the Date Taken properly though.  While it does 'capture' it, none of the EXIF tools recognize it.  I'll move it up when it can :D"
5512,A Google user,"March 18, 2017",1," Terrible resolution. Blurry. If you know what you're doing, you can get better results just by taking a photograph of the original rather than using this app."
5513,A Google user,"March 18, 2017",1, The multiple scans produce poorly aligned images that are worse than a single photo. This app needs major work.
5514,Paul Runnoe,"April 6, 2017",1, Terrible. Really hard to use. Worse quality then just taking a picture. Didn't even remove glare.
5515,Sid Emm,"March 2, 2017",2, I didn't like it. As I woud still prefer to use the camera to scan. I feel capturing a photo is still better. The image gets shaky a bit using scan app especially for documents scanning.
5516,Овотар Овотаровић,"April 15, 2017",2," i'm disappointed. the resulting images are of really bad quality, totally unsharpened, with biased colours, no glare being removed despite the claims. also, one can't save the images without having them uploaded to google photos (so goggle could have and use them), which is pretty annoying."
5517,Andrew John,"April 7, 2017",4," Very good at removing glare. Only fair if image is behind glass. Final image is about one fourth the resolution of the camera's native capability. Overall, a useful tool."
5518,Russell R.,"April 19, 2017",5," It really does produce photos with glare for some reason, but maybe it's my phone.  I'll try it on another, but otherwise this app is superb."
5519,DW H,"March 5, 2017",2, Every single picture leaves a flash spot on it from when the flash goes off during scanning. Then 2 out of 3 times you can't move the circle to any of the 4 dots. Just freezes. G7
5520,Mike Cutmore,"February 25, 2017",4, Great scanner with good integration to photos app. Good that a resolution update for pixel has been applied.

The manual dot calibration is novel but seems quite a procedure compared to say Microsoft's Office Lens app which seems to do most of that automatically (although it's more text oriented). Top marks.
5521,Aleksandra Kiebdoj,"March 22, 2017",5, Great app. My mom will love it as we have soooo many analog pictures from our childhood. The only thing that will be great to add to this app is an option to put a date of the pictures.
5522,Rob Gerrets,"March 18, 2017",5," After a small amount of trial and​ error, does a great job of saving old photos. As good as most scanner then photo editing techniques I've used."
5523,Jeremy Smyth,"May 4, 2017",1, Not sure why this is getting good reviews. HTC may be the problem. One m9 with nice camera but it has skewed every photo so far.
5524,Alex Raymont,"March 5, 2017",2," Seems very low resolution. And no option to save a higher res version. OK glare reduction and color. But it's thumbnail quality, not archival quality"
5525,Nicholas Abney,"March 1, 2017",5, I love how my photos come out with using this app. I like how you're able to adjust the corners to get the whole entire photo without missing any detail. I LOVE THIS APP!!!
5526,Sheldon Jay,"March 30, 2017",5," So danged simple! Just follow the screen prompts. I am absolutely shocked at how it perfectly scans and automatically straightens photos, even with unsteady hands and it even cropped out the top of the table I had placed the original photo on!  Totally amazed."

5528,Paul Baker,"March 25, 2017",5," This works amazingly well! I'm using it to scan thousands of pieces of my kids' artwork. It quickly and automatically accounts for focus, tilt, crop and the flash helps with quality. It does exactly what I want, except give me a choice of album to save to."
5529,Rana Ahmed,"April 2, 2017",1, Never backup photos. Once scanned they are lost forever. Just resides inside this useless app with no capability of sharing. Does not backs up photos to Google photos

5535,Erik Oxaal,"April 21, 2017",3," With a lot of old photos lying around this app certainly fills a demand. However many photos I'd like to scan are many years old, and an obvious feature that's missing from the app is the ability to edit metadata such as date and time when scanning"
5536,cha v,"March 10, 2017",1, It's ok but to dam slow and create blur and shadow.  The slowness is the true issue photo stacking isn't working 100% perfect

The way the app takes the first, whole photo, and then each corner marker to refine detail works well, although the one drawback I found is that you need a steady hand."
5841,mike thepoolguy,"February 15, 2017",5, A for effort. Right now at this stage in the app the photos always don't line up correctly and there is a blur or a smudge look. I hope to see this developed further it is a good idea. I always have tons of paperwork and it would be great to scan all the documents.. even pictures it blurs on most.
5842,Gerard van Schip,"February 1, 2017",2," I'm confused what this app is supposed to do.

Took 1 photo of a flyer with the normal stock camera app, then used this this app to take lots of photos that it stitched and when I compared them side by side the normal photo was sharper, of higher resolution and better colours. I guess this app is nice for someone with a ridiculous low res camera?"
5843,Thomas Hyde,"February 22, 2017",2," I really like the concept of this app and maybe someday it will work. But every time I tried it even on different devices the images were not even usable.  Glare, blurry and very low quality.  Looking forward to more updates."
5844,Tyson Benard,"January 26, 2017",3," I really want to love this app. It's a really great start, but needs some refinement that I'm sure it will get as Google polishes it up.

My phone (Galaxy S7 Edge) goes out of focus (after initial clear focus) while I'm in the ""moving from dot-to-dot"" stage and the dots will ""lock on"" to an out of focus image before prompting me to move on to the next dot. A focus lock feature after the initial focusing would be great and would alleviate pretty much all of my frustration with the app."

I've been scanning all of mine and my family's physical photographs for a few years now in order to have them backed up and stored for safe keeping and for my kids and future generations to have. I'm actually using this app to scan pics I've already scanned with my scanner. It's just that good.
5846,Missy Narkiewicz,"February 5, 2017",5, Awesome way to add pictures you took before you went digital. You can keep them in the photo albums. The process takes a little practice but very cool. The only thing I would like is to became to add the date of my newly scanned picture so it's in the correct place in the rest of my photos.
5847,Kaneki Ken,"January 26, 2017",3," The concept is awesome. But sadly the resolution is lacking. My camera can take 16 megapixel photos but this app isn't taking advantage of it.

But sadly the resolution is lacking. My camera can take 16 megapixel photos but this app isn't taking advantage of it. The images it takes come out blurry and not high enough resolution. The anti-glare aspect is hard to get to work too. I would give this app 5 stars if it was easier to use, and actually used my camera's full resolution. It's photos look a lot worse than what I can take just in the regular camera app."
5848,Chris Levang,"February 14, 2017",3, I like the concept and interface but the resolution is too low for me to use it yet. I have a Droid Turbo with a very good 21mp Sony sensor. Not as good as the Pixel but it should be able to get more than an over compressed 2mp image.
5849,Dann Veldkamp,"January 26, 2017",3," Very disappointed with the results. It seems to have difficulty identifying the edges to the picture. Results are not ""archive"" quality. But, as with all Google Apps, we can expect a stream of updates. Or, it may simply disappear."
5850,Junze He,"February 23, 2017",5," This is an ingenious idea. Besides the increase in quality compared to taking a picture, it also removes glare and the like which is what annoys me more than resolution. I use it to scan documents sometimes too."
5851,Pankaj Kumar,"February 18, 2017",4," Photos scanned are not as good as they come with a real scanner, yet. I don't care, used the app to scan my IDs and Licences and stuff like certificates. This damn thing aced it! Love it. Please make it capture at the full capacity of camera so I can scan some large research posters and stuff. Thank...Full ReviewPhotos scanned are not as good as they come with a real scanner, yet. I don't care, used the app to scan my IDs and Licences and stuff like certificates. This damn thing aced it! Love it. Please make it capture at the full capacity of camera so I can scan some large research posters and stuff. Thanks."
5852,Vihanga Uduvila,"January 27, 2017",1," I love the idea but I hate the app cause the scanned photos have no quality. The resolution is very bad. Very very bad 😟 This is the 1st time I said ""I HATE YOU!!!"" To a google app. So sad."
5853,Meg Daas,"January 30, 2017",2," I had high hopes for this app, but was sorely disappointed. No matter how many times I tried, dispite being told by the app not to worry about it, my photos came out with horrible glare. When I tried without the flash, the image was out of focus. Cam Scanner does a much better job."
5854,Avinash singh,"February 19, 2017",1, Couldn't be worse. This app is literary garbage. My phone is clicking better pictures with its default mode. Even office lens had better clarity than the pictures clicked by this app. I am using z1 so camera is pretty decent.
5855,Hexivoid Gaming,"February 13, 2017",1,Bad resolution Maximum image resolution is 3 MP. Zoom into a photo and everything's pixelated. If the max image resolution cap gets raised I'll try this app again.
5856,Tack Wee,"February 13, 2017",3," Cool concept, especially the technology to remove glare. But scan quality is too poor to consider keeping, have to wait until the resolution is increased before I consider investing my time here."
5857,Jair Cursiol Filho,"January 28, 2017",3," So far, it has average-to-good results. Round icon on Google Pixel does not have a shadow that is on every other Google app, making it feel out of place."
5858,Frankie D,"February 16, 2017",4, Please give us the option to move it to SD card. Hate deleting apps all the time to make room.
5859,Guðmundur Valur Viðarsson,"February 23, 2017",2," Intuitive UI and nice enough to use. The end result is just, without exception, disappointing. The colours are either blown out or faded and overall quality is simply subpar."
5860,VIBHOR,"February 24, 2017",3," Doc can be clicked by camera are more impressive than this app... But auto crop function make it useful ,if they short out the problem of photo resolution this can become one of essential app for office....!"
5861,Harry,"February 19, 2017",3," Taking a picture with the stock S7 Edge camera app is of comparable or greater quality than using this app.   In no way is this app a replacement for scanning a picture to make a copy, and I'm pretty sure most grocery stores & pharmacies have picture scanners that are free to use."
5862,Christian Jolly,"January 23, 2017",3," Amazing concept, but should be able to take advantage of the max camera specs. 6 megapixel stills from a 16 megapixel camera....meh. But 3 stars for being a good option where there previously was no simple solution for grabbing quick effortless scans."
5863,Nishit Shah,"February 23, 2017",4, It's really a good and simple app. Captures the objects perfect and does the image processing so perfectly. This app could be the best among all other apps if Google provides a feature to convert scanned images to the PDF directly from the PhotoScan app.
5864,A Google user,"February 2, 2017",2," Works great, but photo quality is just awful. You'd get a much better picture simply by using your camera"
5865,Ahmed Moharram,"February 24, 2017",3," A good idea, but output photos are low quality, so it's better to just take a shot with normal camera, you will end up with much higher quality/resolution."
5866,Leandro Neves Bispo de Lima,"February 6, 2017",2," Low resolution pictures! Even having a good idea behind it, it doesn't take advantage of the camera's resolution! Pretty good images until you zoom on it or open on your computer"
5867,Noah Jenkins,"February 5, 2017",3," Great Idea but, lack of execution. The pictures are sometimes poor quality. I think in future updates this app will get much better.😀😀"
5868,Jihan Joo,"February 14, 2017",2," Interesting idea, but the technology simply isn't there yet. I tried a few photos but wasn't satisfied with a single scan. Will wait for the tech to mature."
5869,Talden Vader,"February 5, 2017",4," Its great but... Sometimes its having some issues procesing photos, sometimes it processes correctly and sometimes it doesn't. It needs some more work but otherwise its great"
5870,Svetoslav Bonev,"February 24, 2017",3," After the update focusing works, though not always and kind of pain in the a.. at times. The glares from the flash though is not removed as stated. Getting better, good."
5871,Daniel Fitzgerald,"January 24, 2017",2," The quality is poor, especially when scanning documents. The default settings cause huge flare from the flash being enabled. The standard camera app on the MotoG3 does a sharper, clearer scan at a higher resolution."
5872,A Google user,"January 30, 2017",1," Resolution too low, quality bad. ""Scanning"" with the smartphone camera is 10x more detailed"
5873,ashJcoops95,"February 8, 2017",5, I love this app. I have so many old family photos that I don't want to lose. I can now save them digitally in seconds rather than spending ages taking and cropping the photos. A real life saver for anyone who has many cherished family photos.
5874,Mike Noordijk,"February 22, 2017",2," At least with my phone (Note 3), the pictures lose detail and faces are distorted,  resulting in unusable pics."
5875,Indranil Banerjee,"February 1, 2017",2, Pls improve the resolution and photo quality. Except that its ok but the resolution is not at all good. It cannot identify the edges as well.
5876,Kastriot Qerimi,"January 30, 2017",5," Not getting good quality photos in my Nexus 5. Probably it doesn't work with old hardware, but I like the idea of having an app like this though."
5877,Drew Hester,"January 31, 2017",2," I have the LG G5 with an amazing camera, but all the pictures I take with this app turn out terrible!  I can't believe Google isn't fixing this issue immediately."
5878,Ron Ng.,"January 31, 2017",1, Poor quality. I can snap and crop the photo to have much better in result.
5879,Rebecca Mc,"February 24, 2017",1, Compressed resolution and poor focus. Waste time.
5880,Amy Porter,"February 20, 2017",2, The photo quality isn't much better than taking a picture of the photo. It isn't very good at knowing where the edges of the photo are either.
5881,Madhvika Sehgal,"February 18, 2017",1, Unclear. Can't find any use of it. Better to take a normal picture and crop it. Camscanner is a much better application!
5882,Shrikanta Raje Urs,"February 13, 2017",5," I have used so many photo scan apps, this one is the best so far. It removes glare and makes the picture   as good as scanner output"
5883,Jenia Habinsky,"February 17, 2017",1, I cannot understand why this app takes four hi resolution images to create a low resolution one
5884,Paul Harrison,"January 25, 2017",2," When it works, it works well. However, it's just started restarting my phone everything I take a picture. Any ideas Google?

However, it's just started restarting my phone everything I take a picture. Any ideas Google?  UPDATE: even the latest version still makes my phone restart every time I take a picture. Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo on 5.1.1, recently reset, no software upgrade being offered by my network. Happy to answer any further questions to get this resolved, you know how to get hold if me Google!"
5885,sandeep kumar,"January 29, 2017",5," Brilliant and easy to use, including PDF options for doc will be addon like office lens. Hope will be seeing this option in coming release :)"
5886,Amit Sinha Roy,"January 30, 2017",5, Amazing app for taking snaps of framed photos. Completely removes the reflections and glare from the glass frame.
5887,A Google user,"February 12, 2017",1, After scanned the output photo is totally poor quality.Don't like it!
5888,Dalia Bruce,"April 19, 2017",5, The free storage comes with Google photos. And of course your Google Cloud Drive which you can buy extra storage if you like! You'd be surprised at how much Google takes care of their people with free and low priced subscriptions. 😁
5889,Hazem KUNNANA,"January 25, 2017",3, Output not so great as expected and advertised. Reflection are still there quality isn't great either.

5892,Neil Whelan,"February 18, 2017",2," Repeatedly and consistently results in a blurry or low ""quality"" shot (except when it's a small photo) - tried across a Nexus 5x and a Xiaomi Mi5s. App is definitely not up to the usual Google standard."
5893,Kevin Brown,"February 14, 2017",1, Installed it. Tried to use it. After its done the scanning thing my phone shuts down and restarts itself. What's all that about?
5894,Bishal Biswas,"February 13, 2017",5," Absolutely love it. Does the job of a computer scanner. Not just photos, you can literally scan anything. For better results make sure the background of the scan area doesn't match the item being scanned."
5895,Martin Fowler,"January 24, 2017",4," Getting better, resolution improvements slowly making this a great little tool for capturing previous prints. Keep going Google."
5896,AJ H,"February 7, 2017",1, Very low res.  It has potential to be better but very blurry pics due to not utilizing my camera's full resolution.
5897,Ehsan Elahi,"January 25, 2017",5, It works perfectly on everything scannable. From photos to documents. It even works on pictures hanging on the wall. The quality is good too
5898,o Binho,"February 22, 2017",1," Não funciona com desenhos, além de ficar em baixa qualidade. Eu tentei escanear um desenho e foi a mesma coisa que tirar uma foto dele"

5907,umesh tiwari,"January 26, 2017",1, Total trash app never use it instead use shoe box it is a better app
5908,David Edelsohn,"February 17, 2017",2," Awful. It removes glare, but the image correction produces horrible pictures. use a scanner."
5909,Kyle Knecht,"January 26, 2017",5, What a great idea! An easy way to bring your physical pictures into the digital world
5910,Slawa Huber,"January 24, 2017",3, Very low resolution. Quality can be much better.

5913,The Huffmans,"February 11, 2017",1, The app always ends up with blurry pictures.
5914,Ayush Dey,"February 8, 2017",5, Very useful. Can't get any better
5915,Sachin J,"January 31, 2017",5, Worked pretty decent. Want to persevere all my old photos. Thank you google.
5916,Jo Po,"February 18, 2017",2, Not the best app for scanning photos. Much easier just photographing photos in good lighting.
5917,Francesco Patti,"January 30, 2017",2," Great idea, but needs to be improved: picture quality is way below the achievable quality with my device. I look forward for the fixes!"
5918,A Google user,"February 20, 2017",1, Result is not high res. Not worth it.

5926,Hariprashad Ravikumar,"January 30, 2017",1, It take images at poor quality

I compared a scan done with my ancient Epson scanner with the one from Photoscan.  The one from the scanner is clearer. The photoscan photo is slightly blurry in comparison. The file from photoscan is 2000x1333 96dpi file size 467KB. Given that google advertises ""hi-resolution"" photos from photoscan I wonder what they define as hi-res?  I tested the app with 2 photos. One was a typical glossy photo. it did a great job of eliminating glare. The other was a professional photo with a textured matte finish. Photoscan could not eliminate the glare. I tried it several times.  So, if you do not have a scanner and don't mind waiting the 5-10 seconds or so to scan with your phone and you don't care that the pics are slightly blurry, this app may be for you. Please note that you must click ""Save"" on the photos after doing the scan or they won't show up in your google photos app."

And aligning the circles with the dots without leaving the picture entirely is nearly impossible.  I've tried flash, no flash, dark background, light background, color photos, black and white photos all to no avail.    So maybe phone specific, but the app is totally useless to me.  Another ding:  when you go to Google support communities many, many apps are listed, but not PhotoScan.  As a very happy user of Google Photos and other Goog services, I'm very disappointed in all respects here.  EDIT: I'm on a Google forum about this and another LG G5 owner reported the same problem.  Definitely feeling like it's phone specific.  Are you listening Google?  What's the deal??"

I tried many times the same picture with and without this app. The photoscan photo is  always blurrier with higher contrast than the real. Also the resolution is lower than the regular cropped photo. So whats is the benefit? A single photo with just cropped-perspective  selection  would be simpler and better, but that would be too simple to justify a separate app. Why don't you just integrate the perspective-crop in ""Google Photos"" edit tools? On the plus side i guess is the flare removal of the flash. But using the flash is a bad choice to begin with either way for scanning a printed photo-document."

I was pretty impressed with the images!  Even mini wallet sized pictures looked great.  It took a little practice and the program is pretty forgiving if you accidentally tilt the phone a little or move it up and down -- best results are with a steady hand and consistent distance though.  Some pictures still had a bit of glare, but I assume it was me being careless because I retook some and there  was no glare the second time.  The edge finder is also a great tool!  I was able to PhotoScan about 70 pictures after dinner and share them with other family who would otherwise have never seen many of them, and now they are preserved forever!!  I still have a lot more scanning to do!! (Pro tip:  Grab a charger!)"

6696,Tom Wasinger,"November 27, 2016",1,"Not that great Had to scan over and over to get correct glare, blurriness, and color saturation. Took more time using this app than scanning manually with a flat scanner."
6697,Daniel Read,"December 4, 2016",4,Good start I still get flare in photos but a good first attempt.  please keep developing and not just stop and abandon like the rest of your apps
6698,Daniel Fleming,"November 24, 2016",5,Boxes of old photos look out!!! This is simply amazing.  Extremely easy to use.  Get my kids to do it.  Saves to Google photos and done.  Finally a simple solution to a project I have been dreading.
6699,Matt Wood,"November 20, 2016",1,fine a different app tried multiple pictures different ways. all of them came out horrible. nicr try though Google
6700,Mr. Crosby Stevens,"November 20, 2016",5, I'm into photography and was impressed with this app. It allowed me to scan all my older family photos and I was able to upload them with great quality. I cant speak for anyone else but I would recommend this app to anybody who enjoys photography or would like to share  older photos digitally.
6701,Teoh Yuan Hui,"November 26, 2016",2,Has potential great concept. But the outcome is very low quality compared to camera app or some apps like Office Lens.
6702,Bal Krishna,"November 23, 2016",1,Does Nothing The circles refuses to move for scanning. Simple Camera of mobile does a better job.
6703,Henry Erik Estrada,"November 19, 2016",1,"Useless app Just took photo with your native camera app, it will be better than ""scanning"" using this app"
6704,Lui s,"November 26, 2016",1,I can't scan I would try to take a photo of the picture and once the flash is lit. The camera goes black. And it cannot finish the process because there screen only has the 4 dots and no picture is shown.
6705,A Google user,"November 26, 2016",1,"marketing, no real benefits Too bad devs think that lowres photo is better than some glare. No real programming work done by google, only marketing. No stars should be here."

6710,Domantas Roduner,"December 13, 2016",2," Good idea, but bad quality. Even photos taken with the camera app look better. Quality is nowhere near a cheap old scanner."
6711,Michael Fink,"November 22, 2016",2,Meh The scans are of pretty low quality. I would rather pay a place to scan my important photos at a decent resolution and size.
6712,A Google user,"November 23, 2016",3,Pretty good for scanning scrapbook pages with photos PRO: can fix page distortion and glare as advertised.  CON: poor resolution.

This is one of your better ideas
6727,Rusty Millabas,"September 12, 2017",3," The idea is good but the execution is disappointing. The app is very slow and buggy. Also, this app should be pulled out form play store and the feature should be introduced to Google Camera cause who needs a separate app just for this? 😤 Please, this is not the Google we know."

6729,Pedram Akbarzadeh Jabbari,"November 18, 2016",5,Photo/Document Scanner Some how even it's better than Google Docs Scanner for documents. Needs more features such as location where a picture was possibly taken and its date to be added as Google Photos metadata.

For quick sharing it's not that bad but for archiving and replacing original film it's not good enough
6733,Aaron Lesch,"December 3, 2016",3,"Great first release Works really well, but at crazy small resolution. .8 MP I think... That's Point Eight, just to be clear.

And this is the first time i am writing a review for an app 'cause this app just took my heart away. This is so far the best app developed by Google inc. Scaned some of my old photos so well that one can't tell the difference  btw the original & the digital form of it. No GLARES (the best part). Just scan your photo with a white background (so that app can give the best finish at the edges). NO BUGS. It just can't get better.

Same story with this app. They've designed an amazing app that takes photos of your photos. But it doesn't suck! You take five photos, one showing the edges, and one at each corner, and it saves it brilliantly. And if it doesn't, you can just go and fix the mistakes yourself. They made that easy too.

The app is currently compressing photos pretty heavily.  It's pretty noticeable when you zoom in.  There should be at least an option for less compression.  2) You guys need to go across the hall to the people in charge of Snapseed and steal their white balance tool (including the eyedropper feature of it).  Taking photos of other photos suffers from the same issues with white balance, depending on the lighting the photo is taken in, as regular photos do.  A properly white balanced can easily become unbalanced.  I ran a few through Snapseed's white balance tool and was able to easily fix things, but this should be integrated into this app itself."

7573,Rajesh TG,"November 17, 2016",3,App works fine if your phone has a good camera App works fine if your phone has a good camera hardware and inbuilt image processing software. Otherwise the quality of the document produced by this app is not great. Better use a scanner to convert your photos to digital format if you don't own a good camera phone.

7584,Taylor Nichols,"November 15, 2016",2," Love the idea, but execution is bad. The camera refuses to refocus on photos, so everything is out of focus. It also says not to worry about glare, but there is an enormous amount of glare when it comes out."

7681,Patrik Svensson,"November 16, 2016",3," Great idea, seemless execution but unfortunately falls short in quality which makes this very frustrating to use.  If the app increases the quality of the scanned photos this is easily a 5/5 product!"

7774,Angel Quinones,"November 17, 2016",1,"Won't focus at all... It stays at one single blurry focus level. Which stinks because most of the time, if you're scanning a photo, you're holding it in your hand about a foot away from the phone. Doesn't work at all. Samsung Galaxy S5..."
7775,GARY TAN,"November 16, 2016",5, Great apps. Perfect scanning. Those who complained just didn't follow the instruction. Scan the 4 corners ！
7776,Abraham M. Chomali,"November 15, 2016",5," I tested the app on a 8x10 photo and it worked! This is a great idea, and is a great start. I'm sure that future updates will improve the process further."
7777,-Nerf-Herder-,"November 16, 2016",3,Long way to go I'd prefer we get an option to not use the augmented screen as it's very laggy and if you're too quick misses the centre of the photo entirely. Just have a cross hair and let us centre the photo and find the corners ourselves.
7778,Avel Manansala,"November 15, 2016",5,Scan in seconds! The glare-free feature is just perfect! Plus the job is done in just a few seconds. Highly recommended!
7779,vamshi kailasa,"November 17, 2016",5,Google Very useful app... I used go to the internet cafe for scanning the photos.. After downloading this app my time and money has been saved
7780,Opai Sama,"November 16, 2016",5," This is an awesome app. Prior to this was scanning my old prints manually, before storing them on Google photos. This is hassle free - everything done automatically - including trimming the edges. Loved it."
7781,Daniel Daugherty,"November 17, 2016",1,"Why are all my pictures dark? All my scans are dark, underexposed. What am I doing wrong? Or is it the app who is wrong?"
7782,Monib Syed,"November 18, 2016",5,Excellent app ..must hv in digital age loved it ..just cant stop using it ..thanks for such useful & friendly app Google. 5stars n more !
7783,Bids Von,"November 16, 2016",4,Awesome.. Trouble with dangling dots the four dots moved out of original place after i hover it to first dot... Besides that it was working wonders...
7784,prashanth chandrasekaran,"November 15, 2016",1,"Office lens is much better Office lens has been doing this for over year and is much better. Just because it's google, they make a big deal out of a simple app!"
7785,Luke Bishop,"November 15, 2016",3,"Nice idea but... ... it doesn't seem to remove glare at all as promised. Automatic edge finding and straightening good however and fairly easy to use, but having to take 5 pictures of the same image will limit appeal of scanning albums worth of old photos."
7786,Kevin T,"November 16, 2016",3,"Wonderful,but Needs to have a date, time, and location editor inside app so it's catalogued properly. Rather would not have to goto the desktop application to alter those details."
7787,Aanand Mehta,"November 15, 2016",3,Great Concept! Will be a great app with some work Very simple to use however scan quality is lacking and colors are washed out.
7788,Ljubomir Medakovic,"November 16, 2016",5,"Works great on my BlackBerry I hoped my 18 mpx Schneider lens will be up to the challenge, but boy oh boy! The scanner app is great! I've just used it against several photos I recently took snaps of and the end result is waaaaay better! Keep up the good work!"
7789,Brian Falah Harnanda,"November 16, 2016",2,"Usefull but still need some work Every time i take a photo,the photo always turn to green idk why,please fix this google and i will give 5 star thanks"
7790,Bruce Engelhardt,"November 16, 2016",2,Work in progress Final resolution is way too low. The concept is great but the way it is working now I can get a better picture using the regular camera app.
7791,Nikita Kaminskyy,"November 15, 2016",4,It's OK but need polish I scanned a black and white photo very well but it had glare on the final picture despite saying to me not to worry about glare in the beginning of the scan
7792,Eric Pickerill,"November 16, 2016",4," Really great- but sometimes flash glare is still visible. Overall very impressive, and looking forward to updates and improvements!"
7793,Akhil Haria,"November 17, 2016",1," Photos come out very dark, so sth wrong. Good idea though"
7794,Olumide Adebayo,"November 17, 2016",2,Blurred image Using samsung note 3. Poor image quality....needs more work
7795,A Google user,"November 15, 2016",4,Clearly a good start. Crazy good at first try. I'll come back after I do my first full box of photos. That should be about a month from now. But I admit I was surprised. Good job Google!
7796,Bryan Brady,"November 15, 2016",3,"Note 4 fuzzy Cool idea, but images won't focus. Takes a great blurry image."
7797,Nagateja Bonala,"November 15, 2016",3,"Tried it on documents and it is not meant for documents. The first image looks good and bright, the final result after connecting all four dots make it completely dark and unusable. May be its because of a document. Will try a photo later. But this shouldn't have happened."
7798,Stephanie Hare,"November 16, 2016",2,"Needs Work I tried several times to scan a picture and got less than stellar results each time. Some still had glare, some cropped inside the corners, some were blurry, some had weird black dots where I assume glare was removed, and ALL were low quality."
7799,Bharat Bothra,"November 16, 2016",2,Not better good This app good. But camera not showing good brightness. And capture photo processing not fast.
7800,Danesh Manoharan,"November 16, 2016",2,Not getting sharp scans Not been able to get sharp scans on my S5. Can a zoom feature be added?
7801,Rupak Chaudhary,"November 16, 2016",2,I don't like this app I am expecting that this app is very good but I really experience very bad.  My phone camera is better than this app.
7802,Adam Boesch,"November 15, 2016",1,Too blurry The camera with this app is super blurry and doesn't focus at all. Basically the opposite of what this app is supposed to do.
7803,Jared Wertz,"November 16, 2016",4,"Love it, only asking for one improvement Love this app! I'm a huge family history fan and this is perfect for when I travel abroad to visit relatives. I wish there was a high resolution feature for larger photographs, like 11x14 group photos. Otherwise super excited to see where this goes!!!"
7804,Deco,"November 16, 2016",5,"Does the job I have to say i am impressed. I would recommend that the stuttering during the scanning of the dots be reduced however, awesome feature nevertheless."
7805,Erika Carlson-Hiles,"November 17, 2016",2, Needs the ability to focus! Samsung Galaxy S5...no matter what I did all the photos were blurry as it would not focus.
7806,jason hill,"November 16, 2016",1,Pointless app Just use a camera has a better picture
7807,Troy Spicer,"November 16, 2016",5," The photos can seem kind of low resolution, but they do look really good if you don't zoom in close.  (Using a Pixel XL)     Regardless, it's infinitely better than using a scanner.   Hopefully the algorithm can be improved."
7808,Dave Davis,"November 18, 2016",2,Google Hates Changelogs Why on earth are changelogs such a hassle for Google? It's literally a 5 second task. No idea if this version has improved anything because I have no 8dea what it was attempting to solve.
7809,S L,"November 15, 2016",5,Perfect Just used this to digitize my grandfather's quickly fading pictures from the European Campaign during WWII. App worked like a champ.
7810,Ahmed AlZayani,"November 16, 2016",2,"Not ready yet If I will be using a tech to convert 500+ printed old photo to digital than it must be a very good one, this app is ok but miss a lot of details that I can see in the photo but not in the digital version."
7811,Sh Bi,"November 17, 2016",1,"If you have Note 4, this won't work Like most people using this app with a Note 4, it won't work as it should. The phones camera can not auto focus on the picture so it will be blury. You can only wait until Google updates the app to fix the bugs."
7812,Damián Cortese,"November 16, 2016",4,Love the concept Very easy to use and surprisingly quick. Photos are a bit washed out but after running them through snapseed they look perfect.
7813,Darko Jaksic,"November 16, 2016",5,"Works Well I like this app. For people who rated it low, try disabling the flash when you have enough natural light and also, don't scan the photos in a low light environment so they don't come out dark."
7814,Patrick V,"November 15, 2016",5,Worked better than I thought I tried it on a few old photos on my wall and was surprised to see no reflection from the glass. This app is going to be handy.
7815,Jase Daggett,"November 15, 2016",3,Flash turns off after initial photo My phone's flash turns off automatically when the app loads the 4-dot UI. S7 Edge (SM-G935T).
7816,A Google user,"November 15, 2016",4,"Works great ... Needs some features Post capture editing would be great. Also, the app needs to ask for date and time stamp immediately after taking the photo. Without adding a date/timestamp,  Google photos just thinks it is a photo taken today"
7817,Shaun Dunmall,"November 15, 2016",2,Not much cop Seems a little pointless. Takes worse pictures than just taking a single shot using the regular phone's camera software. Or am i missing something?
7818,Sunil TG,"November 16, 2016",2,Scanned photo quality is bad. It avoids glare but the overall quality of scanned output is nowhere near Camscanner.
7819,A Google user,"November 16, 2016",5,"Throwback Thursday photos made easy Finally an app that allows you to take your hundreds if not thousands of photos over your lifetime and digitalize them to share with others, I was waiting for this app 3 years now and glad it's here!"
7820,Tebu CT,"November 15, 2016",3,Picture Quality It was a good app but the picture quality not good enough. I like how this app work. Nice idea..
7821,Shawn W,"November 16, 2016",4,"""Move this circle over a dot"" I have tried this several times on one picture and it fails every time because I can't seem to fire the neurons required to ""Move the circle over a dot"". Dot doesn't move. Circles don't move. I am a failure and I couldn't get this app to work once."
7822,Richard Ward,"November 15, 2016",5,Great. Some took a few attempts but most are fine.  Having great fun posting 50+ year old photos to Facebook.
7823,Jonathan M,"November 18, 2016",3,Doesn't work on S7 It doesn't put the circles in the corners of the photos or do any enhancements. The end result looks just like the initial photo that the app took.
7824,Caroline Kerbelis,"November 15, 2016",1,Blurry The camera could not focus and every picture I tried to scan was blurry.
7825,Richard Keast,"November 15, 2016",1," Unusable in its first release.  There's no auto-focus so photos are worse than the normal camera app, well on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 at least.  I await updates..."
7826,Sushnata Chatterjee,"November 17, 2016",1,It needs some major improvement The app can't focus. No color correction. The end result is much worse than apps like camscanner. Totally unexpected from Google.
7827,travis moser,"November 15, 2016",4,Cool Worked fine for me in the right conditions. Needs to be in a well lit area and to be close to the picture against a background that doesn't blend in with the picture and it works great.
7828,Mayank Kumar,"November 16, 2016",2,"Needs a lot of improvement Needs a lot of improvement, practically does nothing more than a your average scanning apps(or even a camera app) right now"
7829,Julio Fantin Ribeiro,"November 17, 2016",1,Does not work with Galaxy S5 The camera doesn't focus at all. It seems fixed focus.
7830,Raj Chaudhari,"November 15, 2016",1,"Unfortunately photoscan has stopped working Asks for permission during 1st run after the small demo and then stops working. And then later when I try to open the app, Unfortunately photoscan has stopped working."

7832,Growchy Smurf,"November 15, 2016",4,"So far, so good! Easy capture, intuitive design... So far, it looks great! Will be back to give 5 stars in a week if everything continues on this path of ease!"
7833,Rain Awareness,"November 15, 2016",3,"There is still glare Photos end up in low definition, there is still glare sometimes and the app barely detects any light other than the camera flash"
7834,Subhankar Dey,"November 15, 2016",4,Great boon... It is of great help to me.. It is a real useful app. Few glitches but mostly it works fine.
7835,Victor Stuber,"November 16, 2016",4,Nice concept Really cool concept but the image quality is potato making it not worth my time to scan in many photos.
7836,Paul Griffin,"November 16, 2016",1,Blurry & Won't Use Auto Focus Tried it but it won't auto focus and there's zero help articles dealing with this issue. 1 star till something is done.
7837,Mitch Mitchell,"November 17, 2016",1,Terrible results! I've tried several photos and they all came out worse than just taking a single picture with the built in camera.
7838,al giencke,"November 15, 2016",5,"Liked it It took a time or two to get a good result.  Don't give up after a couple tries.  Once you get the hang of it you will be happy.  I got better results than with my flatbed scanner, plus it is easier."
7839,isabelle,"November 16, 2016",5,"Impressive I scanned multiple photos, all looked exactly like the original... I initially saw the commercial and had a hard time believing the results would compare to the commercial, to my surprise it did, this is definately faster than a scanner and with same results as a scanner, or even better!!!"
7840,A Google user,"November 17, 2016",3,"Adjust Date Need ability to adjust the date for the photo(s) being scanned. If I'm scanning photos from 1990, I don't want them showing up as if they were taken today."
7841,__,"November 15, 2016",4,Pretty good for a Start So far this is working out wonderfully. The only gripe I have is the resolution seems pretty low.
7842,A Google user,"November 15, 2016",1,Out of focus Cannot seem to focus on anything picture or otherwise on my Galaxy Note 4
7843,Karol Murárik,"November 15, 2016",4,Pretty good but needs updates Photo quality is good enough but without white background it couldn't frame it properly and while using flash photos change coloring (black looks brownish etc.) but for a initial release it is pretty good
7844,Varun Agarwal,"November 16, 2016",2,Not accurate It worked fine for first two pics then pissed off
7845,Ram Pari,"November 16, 2016",5,Works great Looks like google brought the halo and glare reduction tech to everyone
7846,Jon Nichols,"November 16, 2016",2,"Dark,  blurry,  horrible scans Have tried it on a few photos and it's not as easy as it looks.  Photos come out dark and pixelated despite using the flash."
7847,A Google user,"November 16, 2016",2,Dark I have iOS as well as a OnePlus 2. On my OnePlus every pic is dark even with flash.. iOS it's fine
7848,Greg Anderson,"November 16, 2016",5,Amazing This app is a great start. A lot of it depends on the hardware you are using it on. I am using a 5x and every photo I scanned came out perfect. I used it on an S7 and it didn't come out as good.
7849,Mauricio Martinez,"November 16, 2016",2,"It's all glare. Flash turns off a second after I press scan,  when I am moving the phone around,  it's off,  so I just get the initial snapshot with a huge glare."
7850,Heather Smith,"November 17, 2016",5,"Perfect! I have never been able to get my photos so clear. Sometimes they need to be rescanbed, but the clarity is wonderful. Thank you Google. :)"
7851,A Google user,"November 15, 2016",2," Had high hopes but the pictures all had a flash spot on them, just like the video says it's supposed to NOT have."

7853,Wade Wilson,"November 16, 2016",3,"Needs work It seems to be adding it's own ""whitening"" filter to my pictures. Everything seems to be coming out a lot brighter than it should. With some updates though, I think this would be a must have app."
7854,Matt L,"November 17, 2016",1,Won't focus Completely useless because there's no way to make it focus on the picture.
7855,ZorPrime104,"November 16, 2016",4,Good start Color photos are pretty dark. Black and white photos seem to fare better. I scanned on a bright windowsill to get the best results.
7856,Sanjay Addya,"November 16, 2016",3," Great Potential!!  I know this is the initial release and it will get better soon, but as of now, photos are very hazy and low resolution"

7858,Zai,"November 15, 2016",3, I use Meizu M2 note. The result when I use this app sometimes good sometimes blur. I don't understand.
7859,Ken Boldt,"November 15, 2016",1,No good on Samsung S5 This is basically unusable on a Samsung Galaxy S5. It doesn't autofocus so every attempt to scan a photo is out of focus.
7860,Jason Allen,"November 15, 2016",2,"Low light fail First attempt on a photo in low light conditions, goes almost entirely black and thus unusable when the four circles appear."
7861,Bruce Harang,"November 16, 2016",4,"Does a nice job for sharing hardcopy photos online Does a respectable job quickly. Produces an image that views well on phones and tablets.

7866,A Google user,"November 16, 2016",3,Good start but needs work Ultimately works well but doesn't record colors correctly as the white balance is too cool  with the image over exposed.
7867,J,"November 16, 2016",5,"I just met my portable digital scanner!!! Awesome clarity, crisp images, wide spectrums of colors.  Actually takes 4 pictures in quadrants and stitches them together to make clear image not ""pic of a pic""."

Its a really great idea and perhaps a perfect application for google RAISR to help increase resolution and detail in the scanned images.

7886,Ashley Taylor,"November 16, 2016",3,"Almost there. Scans come out looking like the originals, mostly, 1 in 20 is out of focus and a few have a strange soft effect in parts of the image.

7892,Rishabh Gupta,"November 16, 2016",5,5 star just for the immensely helpful idea. I don't know how well this app performs but it was much needed as we have moved digital. It's a start. Will become better with time.
7893,Rommel Rosario,"November 15, 2016",4,"Great but needs improvement This is just the initial version. Still need more refinement and upgrade,but otherwise great and usefull tool"

7897,Aigars Mahinovs,"November 16, 2016",4,"Works great, some features missing The results are amazing. What is missing is the ability to change the date and location of the photos, so that they actually are in the right place in the timeline, but that is more for the Photos app and website UI."

7903,Jos,"November 15, 2016",3," The issue is this doesn't use HDR+ on my Nexus 6P the photos just turn out better if i take a normal picture, this app works nice at removing glare and all but the normal camera app has HDR+ and gives me a higher resolution image"
7904,Lance Salamanca,"November 16, 2016",5,Quick and easy Super easy to use. Photos look great! I would suggest using a stylus to get the corners spot on. Perfect for the Note5.
7905,Lisa Halas,"November 16, 2016",1," Most of the time, it crashes before I can line up the circles. The one time it didn't, the photo is mostly black."

7907,Michael Hovis,"November 16, 2016",2, The app does not properly focus on my Galaxy Note 3 no matter what I try.
7908,Niraj Prajapati,"November 17, 2016",2,Not ready Without flash there are many apps that can scan photos similarly. With flash there are none. Still none because it's almost useless when flashes applied as image becomes ridiculously dark.
7909,Sachin Malik,"November 15, 2016",4,"Haven't used it , but it's a great idea. Much needed app from google side , bcz we are in conversion phase , we still have lots of memories on Polaroids.. thx man."
7910,Bram Vandenbussche,"November 16, 2016",4," I'm completely blown away by the quality of the scan, even if taken in very bad lighting conditions, using the LED on my phone."
7911,A Google user,"November 16, 2016",1,Will not focus The camera will not focus so all scans are out of focus. Cannot find any settings to change the behavior.

7916,Scott Alvarez,"November 17, 2016",5,Wow This really helps in preserving photos. Make sure you use a flat surface and don't adjust the height of your phone while scanning the four dots. This app is a game changer for archives.
7917,Sebastian R. Jepsen,"November 15, 2016",3," Photos often come out with blurry edges and/or a weird gradient of whitebalance.  Also, Photos often have a skewed perspective"
7918,Francis S,"November 17, 2016",3," Great idea, but the end result is basically the same as taking a pic with your phone. Hopefully later versions will be better"
7919,Jay Symon,"November 15, 2016",4,"Good. More updates It's a good start. For future updates, bump up the resolution, it's not very high res"

7921,Ryan Fox,"November 18, 2016",5," Was fast and easy to scan photos with no glare and didn't have to worry about manually aligning anything.  Fantastic!  Would love to see additional improvements, but great start!"
7922,A Google user,"November 16, 2016",5,"Awesome You know what will be even more awesome for the next update, ability to add dates to the pictures when they were actually taken. That would add a whole new level to memories"
7923,Noah,"November 15, 2016",3,"Needs work Great app, needs white balance adjustment. Also PLEASE LET ME EDIT THE DATE!!!!  I would never use photo scanner to take a picture that i could take on the camera app"
7924,Ludwig TS,"November 15, 2016",5,I had hundreds of photos scanned Now I can get the rest done myself wow thanks 😄👍
7925,Mike Helmen,"November 16, 2016",2,Blurry The camera does not focus. No manual or auto focus. Every picture I try to scan is blurry.

7938,Josh Tonak,"November 15, 2016",3,Great idea Don't know why the flash is an option because it makes half the photo black and half bright. Very quick though to do multiple pictures. Good corner adjustment feature
7939,Aditya Rai,"November 16, 2016",1,Crashes..... Needs lot of improvements.... It suddenly crashes just after opening...  It's seems that it is not stable on its screen
7940,Guy Moors,"November 15, 2016",2,"Resolution is too low. I love the concept of this app and immediately tried it when I heard about it. Unfortunately the quality of the scans is way, waaaay too low. You're better off using your camera phone than actually using this app."

7944,Miranda Matocha,"November 16, 2016",3,"Great Idea. I'll change review but right now it's not even working properly, it keeps closing every time I try to open it."
7945,Pete Rice,"November 16, 2016",2,"Doesn't focus properly Easier and faster than a scanner, but using a Note 4 under different lighting with and without flash, the image is too much out of focus to be of use"
7946,A Google user,"March 31, 2017",1, Camera quality from the app for my Zenfone 2 is bad. Some problem with the app's camera integration?

7965,Aaron McConville,"November 16, 2016",3," Has a lot of potential. Would love to raid my old family photo albums and create digital copies, but even with the incredible S7 Edge camera, the image compression renders it pointless for now."
