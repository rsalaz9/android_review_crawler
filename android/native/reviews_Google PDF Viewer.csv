1,reaction shot,"April 16, 2020",2," it's okay. earlier it had a dark background. that was pleasant to the eyes. the bright one now which merges with the document, is not an improvement at all. also, the page number counter on the right is too wide. sometimes the thumb touches it and the pages jump by scores. it's really annoying."
2,Steven Mancera,"April 20, 2020",4," This app is cool and all for viewer. But can we also launch the app itself standalone. And have a PDF / Documents view also.

And have a PDF / Documents view also. Let us quickly open local PDF files and Documents in the Drive or other locations. And let us have a quick annotations, drawing, text or signature tools, add Google Keep reminders right on the app's PDF viewer. And saving it right on the PDF itself Merge the PDF viewer UI with the Drive PDF viewer too. Or just disable the Drive PDF viewer itself"

The only reason I don't give it a higher rating is that the scrollbar on the right is too easy to accidentally get with my thumb, sending me to God knows where in the document. I wish greatly for an option to switch it to the left of the page."
4,Chad Meyer,"March 16, 2020",3," Works as intended, but why is it I cannot have a simple icon for this app on my homepage? Why is it the only way to access this is to open a .pdf?

Why is it the only way to access this is to open a .pdf? If I can even find it w/o using a separate (office) app, and then what's the point of using this? Why does this have to be some hidden endemic android system app that you have to go digging for? Give me a simple icon that I can put on my homepage. Geez."
5,Jadyn,"February 19, 2020",1," Hi there.

I'm having a big problem with this app. I have tried to download it three times, and while it installs, I can't find it anywhere on my phone, nor can I access it from Google Play. I have already restarted my phone, and other apps download and work just fine, so the problem is only with this app. Pls let me know if there is anything I can do. Thank you"
6,Hamza Adam,"April 12, 2020",4," It works even though it doesn't open as an app. All you have to do is, go to downloads, then chose the PDF you want to open, then click on it and hold the file then chose Open with, It's gonna give you choices to open it with original pdf reader or Google PDF. Thumbs up"
7,Singlet Fungi,"April 16, 2020",1, Rubbish! I downloaded this for an easy access icon to be put on my homepage and after it was downloaded I saw that there wasn't an icon. I got confused and checked the reviews on this app then learned that this is by design. There is no easy access icon provided. This app is useless.

As you open documents with more pages, the scroll feature grows in size, making if more likely you're going to accidentally touch it and scroll 30 pages down when you just want to see the rest of the page you're on. Do people besides Ned Flanders test these apps?"
9,Gaurav Chhaidy,"April 16, 2020",3, The page scroller should be at left hand side of the screen so that accidental scrolls can be avoided as most people use right hand thumb while reading. The double tap+slide zoom is very annoying. Sometimes when i scroll fast it zooms in/out.
10,Parimala Renga,"February 25, 2020",1," Not well developed, it is just the basic pdf viewer. If you scroll pdf file which has more than 1000 pages, it becomes laggy and it scrolles 50 pages per second!(if you jump page number to page number). Go for wps pdf viewer lite or adobe acrobat reader. This pdf viewer not suited for big pdf files."
11,Abdullah Sh,"February 4, 2020",2," Please please Fix the problem that when I add the pdf file to the home screen I can't open it unless if I go to the file manager. In previous Android 9 I can add it to the home screen, but now in Android 10 O can't. I am using Samsung Galaxy Note 10 with Android 10 and OneUi 2.0 ."
12,Gabriel Inu,"March 21, 2020",1," I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it keeps going crazy. Whenever I open some file it scrolls down the notification bar, opens the keyboard, then closes, then notifications bar, up and down, zooms on the doc, and I can't even try to read it. Holds true for drive's pdf reader."

U can't find this as an app.. just select a pdf file to open the app( remove any set defaults with other apps or go to app setting and set this as a default)... 4 star only bcoz the app is very basic and lacks many functions like recent files
14,Anisur Rahman,"April 18, 2020",3, The previous version was good but in this version the page number and the scrolling ball overrides my document makimg it difficult to see. Also when scrolling it is more likely to touch the ball and accidentally scrolling.
15,Steven Yagsemal-Doiel,"April 18, 2020",1, last time i tried to open anything with one of the google readers it wouldn't open said invalid file type. though i do seem to have access to documents on googledrive. somehow those too sometimes say invalid file type or give me some other kind of error.
16,Tim & Janet Williams,"March 22, 2020",1," I downloaded this for my Chromebook. The app can't be found to be opened--no icon on any menu, not even an option to open in Google Play)--and when I doubleclick on a pdf I'd like to view, Chrome is the pdf viewer. Waste of space; uninstalling."
17,Adarsh Agarwal,"February 15, 2020",1," What the flip!!!! This app is completely broken.... Cannot find it anywhere after downloading, I thought there was an error so I re downloaded the app but still the same problem exists. plzz fix it, never expected such a big bug from Google where u can't open an app after downloading it."
18,simonmalva,"March 26, 2020",3," App is good except for the little that I used it, but it does not have marking utilities. I have to open the document with another pdf viewer to hi-light and make notations. let me know if the issue is fixed so I could re-install."
19,swarnabh singh,"April 21, 2020",2, It's awesome but does not load all pages quickly and feels laggy. There should be some marking or highlighting tools which it lacks.
20,Laugh With Sammisam,"April 28, 2020",4, This app is great but there is no option for making annotations to any pdf file and also it is not being set as default app for any pdf file.
21,Edward Espinueva,"April 8, 2020",1, I tried it. But uninstalled it because I don't see the use for it. Chrome views PDFs exactly the same way.
22,Da Nu Tu,"April 4, 2020",1," Stupid app, it doesnt work. it opens and closes after trying to open a document. even the drive pdf viewer doesnt work anymore. i have droid 10 and a Chinese phone"
23,BeauTeyMafia Design's,"April 24, 2020",4, I thought I would be able to open up pdf without downloading a app. But unfortunately I have to use this to upload resumes or read articles saved in this format
24,Muath Mohammad,"February 6, 2020",1," I used to love this app before update, after update the page number keep showing Everytime I touch the screen to flip pages and it is really annoying when you read a small pages book , which it return like before."
25,Cristhian Lora,"April 25, 2020",4, It's very lite. But it can't wrap the text; improve the reading mode
26,Sumit Roy,"April 5, 2020",2, Need flip colours for night reading. A mode in which we can switch the text from black to white and the background from white to black for better eye sight .
27,Husain Chitalwala,"March 22, 2020",5, Absolutely no nonsense app. Does not have an icon in the app drawer. Occupies very less space on the phone. Works flawlessly. Very basic and clean app if you want it for PDFs only.
28,Neil S,"April 4, 2020",3, Good viewer and fast. Why is there not an icon for it? Always good to just open the app and have a recent opened file list. Please add icon to next update
29,Samuele Catuzzi,"February 14, 2020",1," No customisation options are available. pages do not fit the screen, it's a barely basic pdf viewer, reading from a smartphone it's nightmare of pinch to zoom in and out.."
30,Jon DuPont,"March 24, 2020",2, Renders images neatly so I guess I'll give it 2 stars. Features are very lacking and you can only open the app by opening a .PDF which is utterly brainless on the devs part.
31,Ed Sears,"April 26, 2020",1, Can't get it to work! It does not seem to open any pdf documents in email.
32,Harshendra Puwar,"April 13, 2020",3, This application is good but it does not have a pdf translator if it is easier to use
33,Rimamsirufun Paul,"April 19, 2020",3, Light app that's why I give it a 3 star🌟 . Document usually is blury on the app.. And that's a no no for me.
34,Adnan,"April 29, 2020",5, Very good service. Now I can able to read all PDF file's.
