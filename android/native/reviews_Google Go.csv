It has really helped me and I think it would make a great alternative for chrome, the only two problems I ran into was that there was no tabs section so you couldn't open tabs and multi-task and manage your searches and the other one was that I had a problem downloading stuff and it really bugged me. I hope you can fix this issues."

I don't have an option to set Google Go as my default search app though. ☹ The voice search, and app search / launching via Google Go is superb. Highly recommended for older device owners and data savers. 😊 Gotta love Google for innovating simpler and powerful apps. Now only if we get a simpler/ lighter version of YouTube app, it would be heaven. 😂"

The speed at which we get solutions to all queries is commendable. Google has played a pivotal role in getting something new on table almost at intended intervals.

WHY IS THIS NOT THERE AS A UNIVERSAL OPTION when it is present in the Parent app. It doesn't make sense whatsoever. Please ass this option. It becomes a harrassment with that option missing. Fix it ASAP, GOOGLE"
8,Vollala Sai Teja,"April 9, 2020",3," Compared to the past,the present features of this app are not so good!im not able to see the top searches readily on the home page as soon as i am able to see them before as soon as i click the search bar!!! I plead the google to restore the feature as soon as possible!!"
9,Anup Vishwas,"April 18, 2020",5," Google Go is one of the best browser, its search engine is also better than other, I'm uninstall other all browser after use Google Go, its customize is very good, easy to use, no bugs, no required any permissions, save our internet data, easily access when we have slow network conditions"
10,Sama Sakheer,"April 16, 2020",5," Faster that any other google for sure. The smart lens option is useful for quick translation and search. The way it predicts what your about to type based on your precious search history is, creepy as ever but this is google we're talking about. You go directly to the website."
11,Safiya Kulati,"April 25, 2020",5," I like google so much but there's one problem with all of my Google apps I cannot download anything and can't use my first google account, and it's very hard to get things so please fix it."

14,Anxty,"April 22, 2020",4," Looks great but we should be able to disable the random words that show up in the search bar (predictions or top searches, I'm guessing), it should just be blank"
15,Bella Bernardi,"April 14, 2020",2," I don't really like it, but that may be because it's just so different from the Google I'm used to. I also can't download Google or uninstall Google Go, which is frustrating."
16,Soham Das,"April 19, 2020",5, I'm loving this app from the time I have downloaded it! It offers amazing features and the best is giving my own theme in the home page. I also liked the app's design!!
17,Chris Skinner,"April 22, 2020",5, I used this in the previous Android model. Not sure why it was removed from Android 9. Like the screen shot icon on the pull down menu was also removed?
18,Naveed Ashraf,"April 12, 2020",4, Many google apps missing in google apps option. Move application option not available. Overall it's a great idea to unite max application. Kindly add remaining apps also. Thanks
19,Amanda Greathouse,"April 24, 2020",1, I loathe that I cannot move or alter the google go bar or uninstall google go. I like regular chrome browser just fine. I despise the interface of google go and it is a big ugly eyesore dominating my phone screen.
20,Shawn Obrien,"April 21, 2020",1, Pre-installed on my phone. I hate it. If I could delete it and install regular Google I would. As it stands I'm planning to add Duck Duck Go and stop using this browser
21,Mark Seven Da Issue,"April 15, 2020",1," ""Okay, Google"" and ""Hey, Google"" not working. Get it together, Google. Your apps suck. Say what you want about Apple but at least Siri works."
22,Logan Parker,"April 12, 2020",5, So far seems like a pretty good lite browser.It does not seem to force the news on you which is great!!I really appreciate that! Thank you!😎
23,Ankit Prajapati,"April 23, 2020",5, Sorts the results really good. Loved it because it shows results really fast and it has whole lot of other features all at one place.

I was wondering for the last THREE WEEKS why my regular voice search app from Google AND the microphone button on my smartphone wasn't recording what I was saying. I am certain that it was due to Google's promotion of Google Go. This is all well and good, however, perhaps it might be best to give us an alert that Google is discontinuing an app before I had to go and clear the data for A LOT of apps and the hours I wasted. That would be the prudent thing to do, wouldn't you agree?"
27,manash pal,"April 20, 2020",2, Page loading sometimes becomes very slow.... Even with 102 kbps. Sometimes good and sometimes not satisfactory ... Mixed experience.
28,Akshay Patil,"April 20, 2020",4, A great app overall though i only wished it had the ability to import the bookmarks and/ or history from the native Google chrome browser 😅
29,Vipin Singh,"April 24, 2020",1, Text scaling is not possible in this app. Provide option to change text size. Also provide bookmarks sync support.

I even deleted the app and took the base weight of my phone. The scale didn't read any different at all after I reinstalled the app. Wow! Good job Google! That is insanely light. You guys are truly magicians. Keep up the good work! Edit: Well I put batteries in my scale. But I'm happy to say there still is no change in weight! I thought 0.00 was a strange weight.

36,Travis Johnston,"April 7, 2020",1," I am completely unamused with the entire ""Go"" platform. It limits everything. It limits content I can search for, it limits me to just a few options. There's no shopping or anything. I am also thoroughly displeased that I can't get the normal Google search."

The only thing I miss believe it or not is the Google weather frog 😕. I miss seeing that little frog with one eye open and a cup of coffee just like me before work. From what I've read on the web I'm not the only one there seams to be Trillions of people who have Google Accounts that don't get it!!!

59,Draco Gan,"February 27, 2020",5," Fantastic so far. Discover is a button away instead of a right swipe away. But the Google searches do indeed come up faster than when I'm using the regular Google App. The most amazing thing is, in webpages where there's articles, you can press the 'play' button to read it out to you!"
60,Venkatesh Bhatnagar,"March 16, 2020",5," Overall, Google Go is a lot faster and loads web pages in less time than the native Google app (which I disabled). It has a simple layout with easily identifiable icons. It is designed for users on slower networks and it doesn’t disappoint. Running on Android 10, on my Nokia 7.1."
61,Ilangothiga 1227,"March 26, 2020",5, This App is a gift for the visually challenged people. It would be great if you would convert other social media sites to audio reads. It would be better if the photos in social websites were designed to listen to those in the audio format rather than downloading them . Please consider this.
62,Paul Gooding,"April 12, 2020",5," I don't like this app at all. I have used it several times and it usually doesn't get me to the place I want to go.

65,Siddharth Eadara,"February 10, 2020",3," Yes, this is good, but each time I type three letters in a search on a Chromebook, the app crashes. Even after restaring the app and also restarting my laptop, it still doesen't work. Only sometimes it works. If this could be fixed that would be really nice to improve this wonderful app."
66,Mashuk Sheikh,"February 27, 2020",5," Simple and easy to use. I like the unique way of loading pages. The loading bar up, with the notification area. It also shows results when you are busy searching the letters. It is fast and convinient to use. Good app by Google. I like it 👍."

What's really bad is that you always get ""trending queries"" from the region you currently are, irrespective of the setting of query language in the app's settings. If I set it to English, I want ""trending queries"" in this language, not another one. Also, the app does not allow you to add apps from other regions, only from where you are/where your account is located. If I, for example, have a German account, but want apps from Greece (or vice versa), there should be an option to set my preference - or, alternatively, just allow me to search in ALL apps without restriction to location."

1589,Erik Romero,"September 7, 2019",4, This app is great. It allows you to listen to articles which made me just look up random things to listen to them. Only reason i won't give it 5 stars is because of the lack of widget options. There should be a dark mode/more customization in general
