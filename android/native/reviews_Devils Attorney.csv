0,Benjamin Cosic,"March 22, 2020",3," Great game, really great concept but it is too short. If you dont want to make the game longer, make a multiplayer. It would be amazing to play this game 1v1 pvp"
1,nc69chicano Gaming,"April 5, 2020",4," This game was so great, but over really quickly. If only there were additional chapters missions"
2,Camreth,"April 25, 2020",5," Fantastic game, only issue is that it is a bit too short."
3,T K,"January 30, 2020",5," Fun, fantastic game. Great animation and voice acting. Probably my most favorite game on Android ever."
4,Aaron Baca,"March 8, 2020",5," Extremely polished. Took years before it ran, but it's a great game now."
5,Melanie Nutile,"February 17, 2020",5, I love this game! It gets really challenging toward the end but not too hard. I just wish it was longer.
6,Amanda Anderson,"December 19, 2019",5," So fun!! A nice strategy game, gets harder as you go. The lawyer and the headlines make me laugh. Overall worth the purchase and I recommend. Graphics and speed are also top notch."
7,Chris Joannou,"April 17, 2020",5," One of the best phone games of all time. Enjoyable, funny and free. No weird in game buys. Superb."
8,Daniel Bryant,"February 18, 2020",4, Great game but action not working right have to tap it twenty times and not accidentally tap it once it selects the action. But selecting witnesses etc works perfectly fine
9,George Thomas Davis Jr,"September 19, 2018",5," This game is so good that it will always be too short. I literally played the game constantly my first time for hours. Very entertaining dialogue.

Game play so entertaining that I searched the company and the internet for similar games, to no avail. Loved the 80's theme. There needs to be a sequel, and it needs to be a bit longer."
10,dead killer had its revenge,"January 26, 2020",3," Really cool game but DEFINETLY not worth the price. It is fun but way to short to be 5 dollar game. Plus at times, it can be quite unforgiving with the number systems. Most times it will give you lower numbers. Was charming but not worth the 5."
11,Dario Dareich,"February 5, 2020",5, Fantastic game and value. Like the quality for a mobile game is fantastic.
12,rainbow weirdo77,"December 29, 2019",4, i wish i could give this game 5 stars cause its a really good game but there is one problem.Everytime i try to get into the apartment the app closes.i still haven't seen the inside of the apartment.
13,A Google user,"September 24, 2018",4," The underlying game is basically like a simple, turn-based RPG combat system, trying to destroy the ""credibility"" (hp) of witnesses, attorneys and evidence before they can ruin your case (your hp). It's not hugely deep, but it has a lot of style and is fun and diverting."
14,Michael Alspach,"October 15, 2018",3," Kind of hokey but still funny. The game mechanics are pretty basic and easily understandable. Unsure as to whether it si really a game or just humor, seems like more humor than game really, but thats ok too.  The theme song is terrible, like 80's themes were.. I know, I was there.  But in all seriou...Full ReviewKind of hokey but still funny. The game mechanics are pretty basic and easily understandable. Unsure as to whether it si really a game or just humor, seems like more humor than game really, but thats ok too.  The theme song is terrible, like 80's themes were.. I know, I was there.  But in all seriousness, the game needs more cases/randomization, because every game is exactly the same the replayability is none, isn't really worth the $4.99 pricetag, even the original 2.99 is kind of steep all things considered."
15,Quinn Griffin,"July 23, 2019",5," This game is very simplistic and a enjoyable way to pass the time, however there is a bug on my samsung galaxy note 9 where I have to click either a lot farther left or right of the ""X"" button.

This may haps be a product of creating the game for smaller devices and not taking the window size into consideration. I've found a temporary solution until the devs fix it. Excellent game nevertheless!"
16,Holly Pracht,"November 7, 2019",5," I played it straight through for something like 5 hours. It was great! The dialogue had me giggling and it was fun! Well made, good job!"
17,James cruz,"November 30, 2019",5, I love this game. I wish more content or stories would be added every half year to quarterly. I would pay for expansion play passes.
18,Zander van Asperen,"January 4, 2020",5, Great game. Fun gameplay and the conversations between lawyers are really funny. Worth the money.
19,alan morgan,"February 14, 2019",2, 2 star because its not much bang for the buck. it's a really great concept plays well and everything. my issue is the game is far to short for the 5 bucks i spent on it i had it beat in a little over an hour of play time.... kinda looking to get it refunded. if it were a longer game i would have rat...Full Review2 star because its not much bang for the buck. it's a really great concept plays well and everything. my issue is the game is far to short for the 5 bucks i spent on it i had it beat in a little over an hour of play time.... kinda looking to get it refunded. if it were a longer game i would have rated 5* but for 5 bucks its way to short
20,Phone Screen Fiend Machine,"August 12, 2019",5," This game needs DLC, the dialogue in court and after purchasing upgrades is well written and very humorous. Every upgrade ""card"" in home, chacter worn, or placed on a personal item has funny names for their effects and those effects are extremly balanced, better than any game I've played. The answer...Full ReviewThis game needs DLC, the dialogue in court and after purchasing upgrades is well written and very humorous. Every upgrade ""card"" in home, chacter worn, or placed on a personal item has funny names for their effects and those effects are extremly balanced, better than any game I've played. The answers seem so simple but the path may not seem clear at first; however, after playing multiple times, there are many ways to finish the cases, but, the final case is certainly a well deserved plot twist."
21,Tee Riggs,"October 15, 2019",4," Funny, brash and all sorts of quirky! Devil's Attorney is a blast to play with its simple, pick-up-and-play controls and easy to understand rules to abide by to succeed in the courtroom.

Devil's Attorney is a blast to play with its simple, pick-up-and-play controls and easy to understand rules to abide by to succeed in the courtroom. The story and characters are outrageously original and each case is a hoot to play just to hear the clever back-n-forth banter between lawyers. The game's not particularly long but otherwise it's pure comic bliss!!!"
22,Sam,"December 29, 2019",5," One of the greatest mobile theme songs ever! Straight from an 80s show üòÇ. Good game too, look forward to seeing what this developer does next!"
23,Scott Ryan,"March 3, 2019",5," This was one of the first games I installed on my first Android device 7 years ago. Just played if again and it is still awesome. The voice acting is superb and the dialogue is wonderfully witty... would love to see more of Max in other forms. Where did you go, Senri?"
24,Brian Tiller,"June 10, 2019",1, Do not use with Samsung!!! buttons on the right side of the screen dont line up with where u have to touch to activate them.

If you touch further to the right they will work however if you accidentally go back a chapter there is no way to go back forward as there is not enough screen room to activate the right button like the others.
25,Duodecimus .Anemoi,"February 20, 2020",5, Fantastic game that you can replay a reasonably amount of times.
26,Ê£ÆÂ∑ùËÅ°,"July 23, 2019",5," As an English learner, I was looking for a game which helps me improve my English. In that sense, this game was a good choice. I enjoyed the conversations between the protagonist (attorney) and the rivals (prosecutors). English subtitles helped me understand unfamiliar words."
27,Jason Provost,"February 3, 2020",4, The input fix for Samsung devices needs more work. 5star with fix.
28,Zenzi Tachikara,"July 10, 2019",2," Having same problem others have reported where I am unable to use many buttons. Most seem to be tied to the ""right"" directional button. Now stuck at previous chapter and out 4.99 for a game that was fun while it lasted."
29,Natalie Fidler,"June 6, 2019",5," Didn't have high expectations for this but it completely surprised me. It's a well designed, creative little game all wrapped up in charming graphics. The humour is on point and the combat is surprisingly fun. Definitely worth the price."
30,Sarah Weyrum,"January 21, 2019",5, I'm playing it for the second time. I had it on my old phone and while searching endlessly for a game that's actual amusing I found this again. There's only a handful of games worth downloading that are both funny and clever. Maybe it's not for everyone but I like it.
31,Kirill Vostrikov,"February 11, 2019",5," This game is very enjoyable - Graphics are at the point, i found most of the jokes hilarious, and in the end, i might replay it from time to time. This game is definitely worth purchasing for its fun story, hilarious jokes, great visuals and pretty interesting gameplay."
32,Will Taylor,"August 9, 2019",3," It was fun, but it was just the same thing over and over. Story and dialogue was awesome, just falls a bit short in longevity. Finished the entire game in less than a day, so what else can I do other than the exact same thing again."
33,Dominic Dennis,"January 2, 2020",4," Fun as hell. Super simple and yes, corny dialogue but didn't matter. Found it really fun to play."
34,John Macdonald,"February 10, 2019",5," really enjoyed this. cheap price and no ads in app purchases. simple gameplay, but requires some strategy to win cases. great artwork and characters. maybe a little short, but for the price can't complain. hope we see max's adventures in politics in the future!"
35,Ray Walsh,"February 26, 2019",5," This is a really fun game. even though it has limited replayability, i would still recommend it to all. I really wish they had come out with a second one. The voice cast is well done and the quips back and forth make the game."
36,Vasileios Karympalis,"September 18, 2018",5," An awesome game with an amazing story and engaging characters. Come for the 80s style and humor, stay for the voice acting and innovative game mechanics. A true gem!"
37,Thomas Donohue,"May 30, 2019",1," This game NEEDS to be updated! Spent 5‚Ç¨ to buy it. At first it was working fine. First installed on an S9. Worked at the beginning and now the arrows in the corners are none responsive, which means there is no way to continue this game!"
38,Alex Bolton,"May 27, 2019",5, I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed this. The art is perfect for the game & as other folks have said the voice acting is a lovely touch. Not having any issues switching between cases like other reviews have mentioned (Pixel3XL).
39,Sarah Jorgensen,"December 2, 2019",1," Meh. Good concept but I just didn't enjoy the game for the price. Great 99 cent game, bad 5 dollar game."
40,Alexander Kohl,"May 19, 2019",4," A really entertaining game. Especially the fully voiced dialogues are hilariously witty. The only downside is the short playtime of 4 hours. Or, as Sun Tzu said: ""Opportunities multiply as they are seized."""
41,roseability86,"March 18, 2019",1," Boring!! You basically press buttons to reduce stats and try to reduce the prosecution's stats before they reduce yours. I thought it would be more like Ace Attorney where you actually interact with cases. Essentially, you watch numbers go down then buy furniture."
42,Jim Barr,"November 22, 2019",5, One of my favorite phone games. I re-play it fairly often - just wish there was more!
43,Nico Sukowski,"November 30, 2019",5," A bit short for the price but well made, funny and a somewhat challenging."
44,Conner Key,"December 26, 2019",5, This game is AMAZING! Please make more court games like this or other games with special mechanics
45,mat s,"December 1, 2019",5, Good game some say it's a bit short but it's a few hours of entertainment.
46,lakisha mcquany,"January 4, 2020",5," A wonderful and funny game, can be a real challenge but worth every penny"
47,Gareth Dewar,"November 25, 2018",5, Excellent game however completed now 7/8 times and would love to see you develop a sequel to this. Can always assist with story line ideas if requested. Massive thumbs up for the team.
48,Ginger & Tyler Reed,"June 28, 2019",1," BUYER BEWARE: As many others have stated, it is impossible to use various controls; especially at the right side of the screen. Accidently went back to previous chapter, & now i can't progress. Unacceptable!"
49,BTN Brake time nerd,"March 28, 2019",5, to be honest I never bought this game because it looked standerd. NOT!! Funny Entertaining and simple gameplay like pokemon games! to top it all of they hired real voice actors so no dialogue reading! worth the money I would buy a sequel too!
50,Ariel Aguayo,"March 30, 2019",5," With its unique gameplay, fully voiced story with recurring characters and original soundtrack, this is one of the best games for Android out there!"
51,Zih Vil,"January 5, 2020",5," This game is just hilarious, challenging, and great, well worth the money spent."
52,Eric allman,"March 23, 2019",1, dont accidentally click back to previous house. I hit the back to finish buying things at store and now can't go forward because clicking the arrow does nothing so can't continue the game without completely restarting.
53,Timothy Jones,"October 2, 2019",3," This game is fun and I loved playing it. It's challenging and amusing. I gave it three stars because I finished in two days, playing only after the kids were in bed. If there were more free play levels after the main story, I would rate higher."
54,Tayyab Wasim,"February 17, 2019",5, Amazing game. Great Voice acting and has a replayability factor that I quite enjoy. Really wish there were more games as well made as this one.
55,A Google user,"March 24, 2019",1," Give one star because it isn't optimized for Samsung. For example: cannot click on the X button to exit a window, or arrows to browse the purchase page. it's really frustrating. I will NOT change this review until this issue is fixed."
56,William Creech,"February 29, 2020",2, I purchased this game yesterday and it's not responding to anything wherever I press my finger...i have a LG Stylo 5
57,Luke,"April 13, 2019",1," Very, very underwhelming. For it's price, I expected a well built attorney game with a good story. This is just a prototype of a simple battle game where you use attacks to 'hit' witnesses and there is no story to be found."
58,Katie Clifford,"January 14, 2020",1, Crashes every time I try to go in the apartment. I want my money back. If I could put zero stars I would.
59,Christopher Niewiadomski,"March 6, 2019",2," Mind numbingly dull. Too simplistic, a hollow shell of an rpg. Looka and sounds good, that I can't deny, but the gameplay is lacking in substance, it's too shallow. Refunded."
60,Simon Owen,"April 13, 2019",2, Seems to be a good game from early playing but the fact that on android you cannot press the x button or the right button to pick your case is a huge issue.
61,Dannemund,"January 19, 2019",5," this game is effing FANTASTIC. From the music to the parody characters and snappy dialogue, it's everything you could ever want in a game."
62,Jeremy Hoffman,"April 2, 2019",3," The story is mostly obnoxious and shallow, and the gameplay is fairly luck-heavy (though honestly not more than many RPGs are), but overall the combat system is neat, and not grindy."
63,Jeroen Thompson,"October 28, 2018",5," Fun courtroom strategy game, a la Ace Attorney. Wish it was longer (both in regards to how cases play out and the main campaign)."
64,Chillia,"July 1, 2019",5," Fun and easy to get the hang of, hilarious dialogue. 10/10 would play again. I just hope the game can be longer because this is pure gem!!"
65,Lee Welsh,"September 6, 2019",5," I love this game, been playing for years. But come on guys! 7 years and no update or additional gameplay? Maybe a Devils Attorney 2? Keep this unique game alive!"
66,Corey Theiss,"February 21, 2019",5," Short and sweet. Perfect mobile game. Make sure you have the sound on, the dialogue is not to be missed."
67,David D,"October 12, 2018",4," Fun and fresh ! Need more cases, levels and customs to increase the durability of the game."
68,marquita greene,"June 4, 2019",2, After paying my $4.99 I can not go forward once looking back to where I started from. Live the game to bad I can't finish it.
69,Jordan Carson,"June 22, 2019",5, A Comedy Puzzle Game that's also an RPG. A perfect example of what mobile games can be when gameplay is the focus: Addicting bite sized fun!
70,Gorazd Milosevski,"February 4, 2019",5," about an hour in seems to be a lot of fun, a bit repetitive but has a lot of unlockables that add twists to the strategy aspect"
71,Courtenay Allen,"January 27, 2019",5," Great fun, good voice acting. simple game play, yet tricky to win difficult cases. excellently produced."
72,Jarrod,"January 19, 2019",5," Fanstastic game! Nothing to pay for once you buy it, I wish this model was more popular."
73,Simon Roberts,"April 11, 2019",5, Neat little turn based puzzle game. It's a little short but I would say it's worth the small price tag
74,Shoumitro Choudhury,"March 10, 2019",5, No ads. no waiting for energy points. No forcing you to pay. Love this game.
75,Andy Nixon,"April 16, 2019",5, I had fun and I didn't run into any problems. The game is funny and has strong turn based mechanics. Just play it. Or don't. Whatever.
76,Mike Ward,"January 3, 2020",1, I can't believe I got sucked into buying this game. It's SUPER lame. Save your hard earned cash for one that is worth it.
77,Wretched H,"October 31, 2018",5, A real FULL game. No in game purchases at all. It's well made & fun to play.
78,nathen horsley,"May 28, 2019",2, why won't it let me play it on my tablet ? I've already purchased this and tried on my phone but ran into issue's and now it's telling me I have to purchase again.
79,Benett Malcolm,"June 18, 2019",5," Actually a really good game, especially for what you pay. Legitimately challenging and has actual replay value."
80,Naizhen chen,"September 15, 2018",2, Game mechanics is boring and repetitive. Not something i expected with the raving reviews and price tag. Good graphics / soundtrack though.
81,Ozunicorn Anon,"September 14, 2019",2, Good game but.. way too short for the price charged. I finished it in a day. Far too short for a game of this price.
82,Fell_Equinox,"March 27, 2019",3," It's great so far, but I cant tap the X and I cant press the blue arrow to turn the page to buy stuff"
83,William Garner,"June 9, 2019",1," If you are a Samsung user, DO NOT BUY! The game does not allow you to ""x"" out of windows, so I was stuck within the first minute of playing. DO NOT PURCHASE!"
84,Brian Miller,"August 30, 2019",5, Have played it through 5 or 6 times. Funny dialogue and nice graphics. Wish there were more like this
85,Deja Anthony,"October 17, 2019",1," There's not much to the game. Once you buy all the apartment upgrades, there's nowhere to go. Mad I spent my money on the game. You guys need more content."
86,Mark Goldsmith,"May 18, 2019",4," I like it, just not optimised for Samsung. Hope it gets fixed, I'd love to play it properly"
87,Amber,"May 24, 2019",3, really fun game but once you finish it. its done ive had this game for idk how long and there has never been anything new added to it
88,titus martin,"December 31, 2018",4, A game that teaches u a bit of law while making u think about your next move. Really interesting with a bit of glamourous courtroom trial.
89,jose,"January 6, 2019",5," Very funny, can't stop playing it, nice idea and gameplay, very good work."
90,Porsha Spencer,"June 13, 2019",1," so overall the game is good but it's broken, the arrow buttons don't work and the red ""x"" button doesn't work either :("
91,Julie Bouchard,"February 12, 2020",4, Love this game just wish you guys would add more case and update.it...
92,Lemony Rats,"February 18, 2020",5," Really fun, and super funny dialog"
93,Fabrizio Fiorini,"September 28, 2019",5," So much fun, love the whole 80's theme and stereotype personalities in the game. Wish they'd make more"
94,Chris Bungenstock,"July 1, 2019",1, Cant use any of the arrows on the right side of the screen. Went back to a previous chapter and now I cant progress.
95,Khalid Al-Qahtani,"November 9, 2019",5," There's only one thing i didn't like, the length (take it as a compliment)"
96,Mark Waszczak,"June 18, 2019",1," will not let me close out the page under profile. evertime I tap the X, just goes to achievements. can only close app."
97,Mike Rigas,"April 14, 2019",4, I like it ...strategy turn based ....but nothing to do with attorneys just a mini game
98,Madison Heckman,"June 20, 2019",1," As others have said, I bought this only to find out that half the buttons don't work on Samsung. Extremely disappointing. I'm sure it's fun."
99,timothy mclaughlin,"March 11, 2019",4," A little repetitive, but I liked it! No regrets about buying it."
100,Ryan Johnson,"January 20, 2019",5," Why is there not a sequel? Or more to the game? This is, hands down, one of the best games available on mobile. I've replayed it 15+ times."
101,Amanda Bartholomew,"June 30, 2019",5, Lots of fun! Very entertaining dialogue and graphics!
102,Michael Bargo,"May 17, 2019",1, Galaxy Note 9 having issues with the blue arrow in menus to purchase apartment upgrades.

104,Timmi Corner,"August 26, 2019",5," Fun, kitschy game. Good graphics, easy to play."
105,Makenna Wilson,"May 6, 2019",1," can not X out of anything or use the arrow button, which both are main features are the game."
106,socksinthebox,"September 23, 2018",3, It's a good game. Just too short and overpriced for what it is.
107,Gignola,"February 9, 2019",5, Fantastic game but like with most games much too short
108,Derek Gagne,"February 26, 2019",5, I love this game!!! I hope you make more or add more levels to this game! Please keep me posted!
109,David Wilkinson,"January 29, 2020",4," Great game, if a little short in the end"

126,Grant Robertson,"March 4, 2019",1, Can't use controls on the right of the screen.
127,FTV Movies,"March 3, 2019",1, I want my money back. This game is not optimized for Samsung and it does not work.
128,Stacey Morgan,"September 4, 2019",2, Definitely not worth $6.50. Very repetitive

130,t maz,"November 29, 2018",5, Why is there no sequal? One of the best phone games I've ever played.. If not THE best. What a great surprise this game was.
131,Carl Baker,"August 5, 2019",3, not bad...passes time....gets repetitive.
132,B F,"July 12, 2019",2, arrow buttons dont work galaxy s9.. 37 cases in don't want to start over.

191,Christopher Willis,"April 6, 2020",5," I bought this game over 5 years ago and decided to replay it today. Unlike some other Android games I've purchased in the past, this one hasn't aged a bit! Still such a unique and well thought out game. And graphics and scaling are on point."
192,Andy Sandoval,"February 19, 2020",5," It's really really really fun, the only down side is that it is short and can probably be beaten in 3 hours or so. The intro tone is extremely catchy and characters fun to watch. Strong recommend if you like light RPG elements with a quirky story and a pick-up-and-place feel."
193,Ben Cole,"December 27, 2019",5," Fun game. Basically run of the mill turn based game. There isn't a lot of creativity involved in playing the game, but it can still be intense in its own way."

204,Charles Klrynhans,"June 8, 2017",4," One of the most entertaining games I've played in some time. Only problem is that it's a bit short and scrolling through the 'attack menu' is a bit unwieldy, which results in selecting attacks when trying to scroll through the options. Still, great game. Really hope they release more levels."
205,Dan oram,"August 24, 2018",5, An absolute gem of a game! I must have played it ten times through and never get bored of the humour and gameplay. I just wish they would bring out a sequel

love the humour. I completed the game back in the early 2010's but playing 
it again now since I bumped into it on the Play Store. Great work, Senri!"
208,Matthew Swift,"December 28, 2017",5," I was genuinely sceptical of how good this would be for the price and thought even the good reviews could have been bogus. I'm pleased that I was wrong the game is awesome, it took me back to the great wit of monkey island. I'd love to see some more cases added over time."
209,Dee M,"December 17, 2017",5," I love this game. Have played it over and over on each difficulty setting. Its entertaining, the animation is great and voice work is excellent. Clever and witty. Very well made. Just wish it was longer, or that you'd come out with a sequel!"
210,Ainsley Goodwin,"December 29, 2016",1,"Refund Hi, do you offer refunds for this game? I played it for a bit and found I didn't enjoy it. The game is basic, and I'm not sure why in 2016 there isn't a choice to have a female attorney. There are minimal expansions and I just didn't find this was my kind of game."

212,JudahTM WR,"February 10, 2019",4," Great game, love the concept and love the story, just wish it was longer. Was able to beat it in 1 night and hoped for a bit more drawn out story. Maybe a part 2, Max and Susan team up? Thanx Dev team."
213,Draken X,"November 26, 2017",5," I love this game, by far one of the best all star cast, voice acting and comedic banter are amazing. I'll love to see a dlc or sequel of this some how. It's pretty short can be beaten in about 3 to 4 hours."
214,Nick Devitt,"July 4, 2018",5," The game is fun, each case feels like a new puzzle and requires you to 
really think critically. Difficulty can be adjusted as needed too, so 
finding a bigger challenge isn't good at off"

Planning how to use the variety of techniques at your disposal is critical to overcoming the RNG of your occasionally flakey attorney skills and forcing the prosecutors to submit to your charm. The humor is a wonderful parody of many notable cases in law history, and while McMann's misogynistic wit isn't always on point, his banter is certainly amusing and helps add to the ironic nature of the game. I've come back to this game multiple times, and I continue to get a kick out of it with each play through."
216,Richard Eckenrode,"January 1, 2018",5," $3 for a fun game, with voice acting? The price is a steal.  I liked the game play, but not be what some would expect.  I also loved the graphics style.  I can only hope for a sequel."
217,Tieu Eric,"September 15, 2017",5, Graphically the art style is awesomely 80's and the gameplay is simple yet challenging. Playing your odds against opponents and mitigation of risk is all part of the Courtroom Themed Fun! I rest my case!
218,Mark Sexton,"December 16, 2016",4,"Fun Very nicely produced and a fun narrative. Game mechanism is a bit lightweight and I doubt that I'd replay it much when I'm done, but a nice light game to fill the odd gap in the day"
219,Mitch,"February 20, 2018",3," Very basic and very simple turn based game (think Pokemon). Even on high difficulty, it's boring."
220,Lia Yomnick,"August 1, 2017",5," Cute premise. Not sure it was worth paying money for, but not a single crash. Cute graphics. Clear directions. Nice game. No in app purchases I've found which is nice and makes paying $2.99 fine."

223,Russ Greeno,"December 23, 2016",5," Great production. GFX and Voice Acting very good. Finished the game on normal difficulty with only a few retries, but with 58 cases, still took a few weeks."
224,Mark Carbonneau,"August 1, 2018",5," It is the ideal mobile game. It requires strategy and some critical 
thinking to solve cases. Nothing too hard, but always enjoyable. A perfect 
replica of the 80's! I love it!"

feel towards the system by letting me play as an unfeeling robotic 
sex-having style robot placed near the top of said system for my own

to frick that sweet redhead you fight in chapter 2. really feels like a 
missed opportunity on the developers part but hey that's what you get when 
you participate in the grand scheme of capitalism to play an ""American 
justice system is a joke"" simulator. Not that it matters to me I'm Canadian 
lol later dorks"
227,Rachel Venn,"September 26, 2017",4, Enjoyed this game. It was engaging and great graphics. My issue was that I feel like it was way too short and even more so way too short for the price. I know it's not really that expensive but I'd expect a fair bit more gameplay/replayability for the cost.
228,Vadim Gorodetsky,"May 13, 2017",5," A great fun game. The humor and the 80's references are spot on. The graphics and the animation are very pleasant and the voice work is great. The strategic gameplay is a bit light at first, but gets more complex further on. Perfect for short bursts of gaming on the go."
229,A Google user,"August 24, 2017",5, Love and adore this game but everytime i go back on it. It starts at case 8 all over again. It's starting to ruin it for me
230,RaskolnikoffAnna,"March 3, 2017",5," Super fun hilarious game. It would be great if there was a way to see your opponents traits by clicking on the, or having a tab with them. All in all, I am impressed!"
231,rhea ropa,"March 2, 2017",5, If you want to know what it's like being Saul from Breaking Bad this a good game for that. Your game can be saved every 5 mins which is great for a busy lawyer.

233,Chris L,"August 20, 2018",5," Easy to get the hang of and is a great way to burn some time. No need to 
log in every day, just play when you feel like it but the wit and banter 
will keep you well amused. Worth the money, I promise."
234,harvey thompson,"May 16, 2018",5," The gameplay is simple, the graphics are unique, and the pre-court session 
banter is on point. You could seriously make an internet cartoon series 
based on the banter alone, I'd watch it."
235,Thomm Haines,"May 30, 2018",5," It's really good. With some good banter. My only complaint is its so short. 
If that's the main complaint then the game is good :)"
236,Andrej Gobec,"April 16, 2019",5," Once you start you cannot put it down. Some new cases would be awesome ... Or a sequel :) But after replaying the game every year or so, this is still one of the best Android games ever. Pure entertainment, zero grind!"
237,Julia Pfl√ºger,"November 15, 2017",5," One of my all-time favourite games on the Play Store. The style and the gameplay are just brilliant and I've never encountered such great voice acting in a mobile game before. Plus, the far too catchy theme song deserves nothing less than 5 stars."
238,A Google user,"February 23, 2018",5," Finally, a game an adult can enjoy.  So different, so clever and funny.  Just the best game out there.  Quite challenging and you'll LOVE the ending.  IF you ever get to the end."
239,A Google user,"April 11, 2017",5," Had it on an Iphone a few years earlier, I had to buy it again for android, but the game is worth it ! If you happen to make a sequel one day, that will be amazing :)"

241,Kane Joseph,"June 17, 2019",5, Best game! Wish theres was a DA2. so well done! If you have a samsung - go to game launcher settings and set the resolution to full screen and the game works perfect.
242,joseph thompson,"August 24, 2017",5, I have had this game for many years and always replay when I get a new phone but I was wondering if there will ever be an update to this game? Maybe a part two? Please add levels or a new story line.
243,Konrad Siek,"June 30, 2018",5," I play it on all my trips. I love the intro and the humorous dialogue 
between cases. The difficulty is just right for me to neither get bored not 
frustrated."
244,Lord Vile,"March 23, 2018",5," Absolutely fantastic game, it's a perfect twist  on a somewhat dated style of gameplay and makes it fun again. Hilarious story telling, plenty of ways to win and a well thought out skill tree and upgrades."
245,Jacque Mangel,"July 21, 2017",5, Super cute game. Really fun and addictive. Easy to learn and get into. Eating my battery though.
246,Jonathon Ball,"May 21, 2017",5, Still one of the best games on Android. Only complaint is the shortness of the campaign. 5 stars for the theme song alone.
247,Diana Harper,"December 15, 2016",5, Great game. But I do wish that there were more cases in it. Or more stuff that you could buy.
248,Riley Kennedy,"December 22, 2016",5,Good play Good to kill time and just waste the free space in my day but great gameplay and overall good game.
249,Kevin Kapinga,"April 24, 2017",5," Very good app, I really liked the conversations before the trials also no in app purchases is a big plus only downside is the length as I was able to finish this at work in one day but overall a really solid game."
250,Ronal Martinez,"January 9, 2018",3," ...2 years ago this game was awe to da some!  But there's no update involving more cases, items for your car and or your pad. Cmon devs, let us know you guys are real. Geez."
251,Christopher Wipperman,"July 14, 2018",4," Very fun game. Gets repetitive very quickly though. Worth the cost if you 
like a quick challenging game that you can play for a week or so."
252,Garrett Butterfield,"August 30, 2018",3, The concept of the game is great and it keeps you interested. But it's way too short especially for the money you pay for it. Please make an update that extends the gameplay and adds more skills and a bigger apartment and more amenities!
253,A Google user,"February 5, 2018",4," Overall this game is rather fun. The gameplay is fun and the characters are entertaining. The only downside is this game is short. Just when the story starts to develop it's over. It would probably be a five star game, if it didn't take only a few hours of gameplay to beat."
254,Cat Daddy,"March 23, 2018",5, This is a good little game think the only thing I would change is story mode make longer and more to it
255,Simon Hayes,"February 14, 2018",5," A very original concept and completely addictive. Unputdownable. I agree with what someone else said though, it's far too short, I completed it after only a few hours of play. I'm hoping for a sequel or something."
256,Ray Evans,"April 23, 2018",5," Im addicted. Put my wife on and now she's addicted. I sure hope there are

like Deep Voice(easy to use accidentally and can't be unselected)."
259,Morgan Freeman,"August 22, 2018",5," The hidden jem without a doubt. It's fun to play, easy to play, the story is amazing and one where you have to pay attention to get. This really is a good game overall."

261,Cameron Thomas,"August 5, 2018",5," The voicelines are amazing and I keep laughing out loud from some of the 
interactions, it keeps you wanting to come back for more to figure out what 
witty remarks each lawyer will come up with"
262,Cassie Machado,"February 1, 2017",5," This game pisses me off, but I can't stop playing it"
263,Peter Becker,"January 19, 2018",5," It's quite a simple game, but the 80s style and humour is spot on. Not much replay value, but good fun."
264,Graham Lock,"February 10, 2017",5," Really enjoyable game, very easy to get into but strategy develops as you get further into the game. Great visual style and corny jokes are excellent."
265,Adam Hinzpeter,"December 24, 2017",5, An awesome and addicting game. Worth every penny. I've beat it several times and still keep playing.

270,Kristofer Alexander,"May 6, 2018",4," Great fun game. Although I finished it within a couple of hours. Definitely 
needs more levels, content and maybe a bit more variety as you progress. 
But still a fun addictive game."

Game itself played well and kept me playing until I reached the end. I only play free app games, took a risk here and it paid off. Got my money's worth."
475,Iceberg Mike,"July 19, 2016",5,"Needs a sequel. This game is fun and I replayed it multiple times but, after about the fifth replay, I just want new content. The turn based court battles were awesome and you had to plan out how you were gonna use your upgrades for the apartment and shops. Hopefully, one day Devil's Attorney 2 will be a thing."
476,Stacia Roesler,"June 15, 2016",5,Lots of fun....entertaining and clever! I rarely review any game but this one was so well done and so much fun! Very entertaining and clever. I hope they put out a sequel. I played it multiple times and it never got old. This is an adult game....I think kids would have a hard time with both the logic required and the vocabulary.
477,Daniel Dickson,"December 20, 2015",4,"Good time waster Simple, fun, mechanics. Turn based attack and defend style with a leveling up system.

I love the story, character, art and humor; especially the humor. The only thing the game lacks is more stages and more ways to improve our skills. I want more :(  This is just a suggestion: I think every difficulty should have different stories and different level of prosecutor. For example, A is the master of prosecutor in Easy mode but in Normal mode A is just the beginning.  Thanks!"
479,Cameron Pelissier,"February 20, 2015",5,10000000000000 stars One of the BEST games ever!

481,Shalom Guerrero,"July 20, 2015",1,Love it but ... The concept of this game is what im exactly looking for. Im like a lawyer who win cases to earn money. But it has no thrill. Coz u dont investigate collect evidences etc.. i suggest to pls make it more realistic . Ty

Only croticism would be it's  too short. but if there were more cases i could be on here arguing it became repetitive. The is to leave people wanting more and that is what is achieved. I hope for a sequel."

485,Nikita Heyduck,"July 29, 2015",4,.... I liked the game alot only i ended up beating it twice within a week and u dont have much time on my hands. Worth the money at first but then i thought not so much because it didnt take long for me to beat it.
486,Yu Jia Long,"March 8, 2016",3,"Refund I actually thought that this game was about lawyers solving cases with many different dialogues to attack the opponent's lawyer. The game was interesting at first, but I grew bored of it after a few hours. Therefore I hope the developers can give me a refund. Thanks and sorry."
487,Guthrie Cannon-MacMartin,"October 6, 2016",3,"Not quite worth the money Game has cute graphics and funny dialogue, but even on the hardest mode, once you figure out the formula to winning cases, it's a bit too easy from there. Also, lack of real customization means there's really no replay value."
488,Linta Valentin Gianni,"May 9, 2015",5,"Very happy about it I'm really happy with this game, great animations, good story's and funny. This game deserved every penny ! I've payed much more for stupid games, but this one deserve a try."
489,Kev Wilson,"March 22, 2015",5,Great!! Love the game. Will there be another? It would be nice if you could see the drama in the courtroom. E.g. witnesses squirming in the dock and funny clips of evidence being tampered with.
490,LifeWith Shenna,"February 24, 2016",1,I didn't get my refund ! Game didn't work. Wouldn't play just stayed at the main screen with some logos and play music so I decided to uninstall it and ask for a refund so I can buy it again and download it but i didn't get my refund so I can download again to see if it will work on the second try . smh

Unlike ace attorney, this game is more like attack-defend turn based, think about pokemon but with lot of commands. Not much challenging, but not too easy either. Character progression is too simple in my opinion. This game is pretty good for casual gamer, but for me it is just ok."
492,Marisa Lockhart,"June 24, 2019",5,Couldn't put it down! Absolutely love this game. It's witty and engaging. Made me laugh out loud on numerous occasions. My only complaint is I wish there was more!
493,Taleem Thompson,"January 24, 2015",5,It's great Ur this lawyer that gets to bail people out of bad situations I mean yea it's not like actual court but it's quite strategic
494,Bakhtiyar K.,"June 11, 2015",5,"Art style, voice acting, humour Is grade A. But the strategy part is kind of lacking. The game could have been more fun. Still, the humour makes up for everything"
495,andrew hayden,"December 9, 2014",2,"Good idea... Terrible execution, not at all anything to do with lawyers or court or cases, its a fighting game... You pick items to lower the prosecutors life bar and win... Its stupid save your money..."
496,John Jordan,"March 3, 2016",3,Meh It's an average game that depends more on rng than skill.  You basically restart each case until you get the random number attack you need.  Some strategy is needed but its mostly random luck.
497,Chantelle Lamb,"November 26, 2016",5,An awesome game Loved this game - it got pretty difficult towards the end but the difficulty curve was spot on. Nice to play a game which doesn't push for payable extras and adverts too!
498,Josh D.,"June 2, 2016",4,"Pretty short game The game, itself, is really fun. That being said, beating the game only takes a couple hours. There is a small replay value, but only a few times. I don't regret the purchase, but be advised...it is a short game."
499,Basel Sayaf,"September 8, 2015",5,Best game I played on a smartphone. I hope they will release new versions with longer and bigger cases besides more growth potential and more complicated challenges. I also recommend adding at least 50 more cases and longer new version.

The dialog is humorous, but somewhat tedious and  does not lend itself to the storyline at all. The game play mechanics are good, but the random nature of your moves means you'll often find yourself restarting a level several times just to ensure a good headstart, which is needed for some levels as they can get somewhat tricky. It was good, but short and repetitive."
504,Shlomi Krasner,"December 21, 2014",5,"One of my personal favourite Smart, funny, intelligent and stylish. I've changed 3 android phones and it's still with me. Exactly how the mobile game need to look like. 10/10"
505,Jimmy Crackorn,"May 30, 2015",2,Not fair. Max's father can't be beaten. You simply miscalculated the odds and gave him too much cred on top of witnesses that do too much damage and too few action points for the player. It's unbalanced. ALMOST ALWAYS scores highest possible damage against player per turn. Player is ALMOST ALWAYS fighting a losing battle because the action points are too costly to improve. Tweek that balancing to make the game more fun. It's frustrating to be intentionally forced to lose and retry for no reason.
506,Sam D,"May 8, 2016",1,"Waste of money I expected this to be alot better but it was a big waste of money, don't waste your money on this if you want a court attorney/simulator"
507,Ant Brain,"November 27, 2014",5,Superb Easily one of my favorite Android games. The production values and gameplay are great - They really nail that 80's vibe. Only complaint? It's not long enough.
508,Ken Uehara,"October 10, 2015",3,"Too short, too easy. Even in hard mode, there's no much to do. You don't feel that need to beat the game, not challenging. Funny and enjoyable up to the second time you beat it."
509,Avi Desmond,"November 26, 2016",2," Good idea but poor balance. normal difficulty is way too easy and hard just makes it luck based in a lot of cases, if you don't get the damage outcome you want you lose no matter what you do."
510,Aaron Foster,"January 25, 2015",5,"Unique and brilliant Don't come into this game and expect anything to be taken seriously. The writing and voice acting is a pitch-perfect parody of 80s culture and courtroom dramas, and the gameplay is unique and challenging."

Once you understand everything thought you can beat the your dad in the last level in 3 turns without taking losing any points.

532,Scoff Mathews,"December 30, 2016",3,"Good concept, hate the RNG Hard difficulty is just hoping your attacks hit for higher damage, and since this is more of a puzzle than it is turn based combat, often it boils down to hitting for 5 damage on your opening or restart."

It doesn't make you think too hard, but it also provides enough of a challenge that you want to keep coming back for more.

The charming characters, witty dialogue, and easily understood gameplay make this a joy to play. I suspect the authors grew up speaking a language where ""attorney"" and ""advocate"" are often the same word, because ""devil's advocate"" would fit perfectly for Max McMann. Still, I wouldn't trade the totally radical 80s intro video for any amount of linguistic geekery. I find myself humming the theme song. Well done, folks, and please keep working together."

I don't like that the game is so short. I've played through twice already and think I've barely owned this a week.  The only reason to play through again is if you want to see the alternate ending.  No replay value what so ever because game does not change.  An update with new levels or an infinite play mode would be appreciated.

However, at some point the cases seemed to ""play themselves"" a bit: there was usually one obvious optimal way to play. This got to the point where I just played through all of hard mode chapter one with only the pimp hat and monocle. Once you figure the basic strategy out, it becomes routine.  Would be nice to have some more freedom or different strategies, but great game regardless!"

While normal difficulty is fairly easy, a second play through on hard definitely provides a challenge.   Some of the writing seems a little rushed.

This is just a nice looking rock paper scissor type game. You get powers to use that deal damage to evidence and witnesses that you get no interaction with.

830,Matt Ruff,"July 31, 2013",4,"Upset.. I did read the reviews, yet I was upset that it was so short. I felt like I wasted $3 on this. Took me less than 24 hours to play. It's good, but waayy too short."
831,Lee Maniff,"December 29, 2012",5,Awesome game!!! I just purchased this yesterday and im sad to say i beat it today. This is my favorite game ive played in a long time. Please come out with a sequel because Max is too funny. Hes the man with the plan and i want to solve more cases!

Asian guy serving suspect meat and Susan Maple putting up with Max's chauvinism are two good examples of this.   As for the game itself it can be repetitive but I enjoy the strategy aspect. Many people are saying its playable 3 times but I think its playable many more times depending on what you level up.  Would be a better price point at $0.99 but I can understand why its valued at $2.99.
833,Caroline Kirkham,"October 24, 2014",1,"Waste of money I love attorney games so I was so excited when I saw this, so I bought it,  and have regretted it since. Its not a proper attorney game, its just point scoring with what little you get given. I regret buyi this very boring game"
834,Thomas Chinyere,"July 4, 2013",5,Who wrote this script??? Because they deserve an oscar! The funniest script ive heard this year. The various lawyer characters and there hilarious interaction with the obnoxious max is the 101 of script writing.   The game itself is a fun and challenging turn based strategy. Great all round game

837,Bill Gouveros,"August 11, 2013",4,"Awesome style, issues on LG Optimus G Very original game, with a clever style. However, on LG Optimus G the apartment screen appears all white, so the game loses much of its appeal. Wish I had noticed before the 15-min refund window ran out."
838,Adam Shailer,"January 5, 2013",5,"Fun game Enjoyable game with a great sense of humour. Might get a bit repetitive after a while. Game gets 4 stars, extra star is for helpful dev who quickly leapt to my rescue when I had trouble downloading."
839,Zachary Beals,"September 6, 2013",3,"Great app, bad dev Post trial quips would help game amazingly, and a little more length too. Can be finished in a couple hours. Trials get repetitive after awhile, so replayability is low. But regardless of all this, still is worth a dollar easily. Nothing new in a long, long time"
840,Lee James,"January 8, 2013",5,"Great Polished, addictive & funny. I've completed it on medium difficulty and currently playing through on hard. The randomness of the damage inflicted is starting to annoy slightly, however I've already had my money's worth. Also, it was a nice surprise that a little story began to evolve. Recommended"

Unfortunately, the best part of the game is over before it even asks you to select a save slot.

846,Daniel Mosedale,"January 13, 2013",1,Really? This game should never have cost money. It is boring and very repetitive. Thankfully I got it on sale. The people who rated this highly must have issues!
847,Husain Bukannan,"December 16, 2012",5,Very Fun Puzzle Game Take turns defending your client by using abilities to tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses until you win the case. Abilities have to be used efficiently or else your opponent will bring your credibility down and make you lose the case. Very fun mechanics.
848,Matthew Ramage,"November 19, 2014",4,Fun game The ending needs the ability to do a replay of  the choice you made. Had phone call come in and missed the whole ending. I have no interest in playing the whole dang thing again just to see the same ending.
849,Kristie Walton,"September 21, 2013",1,"Not quite what I expected. Don't understand all the great reviews. Game uses a point system to use your ""talents"" against the other attorney. Was under the impression game gave you different scenarios to play. Very repetitive and grew bored fast."
850,Paul Moran,"March 26, 2013",5,"Faultless Brilliantly addictive game.  We'll scripted, funny and very entertaining. Requires a bit of thought,  logic, planning and yes... some luck too.  Can't recommend the game highly enough. Hurry up Senri Ab and make some more games."
851,A Google user,"March 5, 2013",3,Fun buy awful script Fun game. Too short. Probably finished normal difficulty in a couple of hours. Hard took a little longer and actually made you think. The script is woeful. I'm not sure if it is aimed at kids or not but it would be pretty lacking even for an 11 year old. Great theme tune though!
852,J. F,"November 28, 2012",4,"Great time waster It's a fun game, humorous and egocentric. But would appreciate some animation after the verdict to make it more rewarding. Also, a bit too short for a game that cost $3 as I finished it on my flight from La to NY.  Definitely appreciate an update."
853,Sam Arnett,"December 31, 2012",3,"Good game to easy n short The game was brilliant and had me hooked rather quickly however it was far to easy I never failed a case, and finished it quicker than I expected. Wouldn't of been happy if I paid full price for it."
854,Keith Winter,"January 8, 2013",1,Boring Mind numbingly boring. All you do is click attacks then spend money on accessories for your apartment. Cute title of the game likely has a lot to do with the sales. Waste of money.

866,Brent Braganza,"June 29, 2013",1,actually a great game but the length is too short It is a very fun game. Hence the more disappointing it is that the length of the game is severely lacking. I think the length of the game is still a major factor. will change my review once there is an update on the game.
867,Gregory Eglen,"January 16, 2013",4,Grade A This game is fun and funny. Voice actors do a good job and have hilarious writing. My only knock against it is it could notch the difficulty up a little bit. I could win almost every case without a retry.

Well done devs. I'm having a bit of a tough time beating the last case but it's still fun. Could you maybe be enticed to make a part 2 or add some new cases? That'd be great :) Oh and far as I can tell the game has nothing to do with Satan or the Devil. Maybe the name of the game is called Devil's Attorney because Max's clients were acting like devil's or maybe the devs are implying that attorneys are evil like the devil? Who knows?
871,D Nguy·ªÖn,"December 4, 2012",5,Hilarious funny game This is a hilarious game. The voice over is well done and the character pretty funny. It can get a bit repetitive but at the same time pretty challenging with a variety of game place and strategy for each case.

874,Roger Finch,"December 12, 2012",4,Lacking depth This game although fun is a bit too simplistic. The cases are too short to allow for anything but the most basic and elementary strategies and the skill trees are too shallow.

In fact it's a turn based style game, where the 'strategy' lies in using whatever skill points you have at the beginning of each case to bring down the points of the opposing side (by using your points to bring down to zero or less points the opposing eyewitnesses, evidence, etc.).   It's more my fault for not properly researching this game as it does mention it is a style based game in the overview."

Bad game design. High production quality, though, and pretty funny. Probably worth the money."
907,Tushar Chandra,"February 9, 2013",4,"Cute, but didn't hold my attention for long Devil's attorney is cute, well made, and I enjoyed playing it for a few hours.  OTOH, I didn't find the game to be very deep and I've started to lose interest with it quicker than I expected.  Well worth it for 3 bucks."
908,Paul Lane,"January 3, 2013",3,"Interesting, but not rewarding. After winning 16 cases, I'm confronted with one that's impossible. I don't want to start again selecting different skills, so it's game over. Not rewarding for players."

This game was money very well spent.   The basic premise of the game is simple - defeat the prosecution's case before they defeat you. However, the difficulty increases as the game progresses and the introduction of new elements - such as witness protection and coaches - require you to think much more strategically about how to win in the later stages, especially if you want that bonus.   I particularly enjoyed some of the cult references, in particular the references to Terminator and Rick Astley were sublime.   This is a very fun game to dip in and out of. It's not the longest game in the world, but there are different endings and difficulty modes so there's some replayability.   The story, whilst not the best, is engaging and some of the exchanges between the lawyers before the cases will bring a smile to your face.   The quality of the animation and the voice acting is superb.   All in all I can't recommend this game highly enough."
910,A Google user,"November 25, 2012",5,Surprised at the great quality! I took a chance and bought this game.  Its really great. Who would have think a lawyer based RPG would be so fun and entertaining.  I wish there were more cases!  Highly recommend.
911,A Google user,"November 14, 2013",5,Fun game Needs more cases and some which are more difficult. The last case took me only 3 tries. Very good game and hope they come out with a sequel. Get it while it's on sale.

It will only appeal to the simple minded."
914,Jason Lay Yee,"February 2, 2013",2,"Repetitive and boring The game is fun for a few cases, until the novelty wears off and you realise you're just at the mercy of a random number generator. Having played through the game once, I have no reason or desire to play through it again. I don't recommend paying full price for this game."
915,Matt Orlando,"September 19, 2014",1," Doesn't honor sound settings until you are in to the game. When I mute sounds, I expect them to not play at all. This one plays them until the game is loaded. Until this is fixed, 1 star. Otherwise a 5 star game"
916,Zack Feeney,"January 5, 2013",5,Sick!! Don't usually write these things but this game is really good. Bit repetitive and a bit annoyed I completed it in 2days. Hope game is continued SOON with more levels!!
917,Matthew Hurlbut,"January 9, 2013",4,"Enjoyable~ Played through it in one day, seemed to have made the right choices for skills because the last case/boss was pretty easy. Wasn't anything like Ace Attorney, rather boils it down to a simple sort of attack/kill of evidence and witness/prosecutors."
918,Veronica Zember,"January 3, 2013",4,Good but... I liked this game but I thought it was far too short. I'm not very skilled at gaming but I managed to finish the game in less than a day (total play of probably 4ish hours). Other than that I have no complaints.

I will buy the sequel when it materialises.
920,Tim Weston,"February 3, 2013",1,"Just don't get it Not great, nicely laid out and fairly well put together but dull. I just don't get the point of it. If it were free it would be fine. Just gutted I paid for this"
921,William McDonald,"October 16, 2013",5,"Fun funny little battle game It's not a who done it lawyer game, it's more of a lawyer duel power kind of battle game.  Very silly and fun.  I love the voice acting and the  character centric plot really helps make the game hard to put down."
922,Aditya Prakarsa,"January 6, 2013",5,"Must play game Best game so far on android. Addicted, and the story just too short. Hope there will be update for more story on this game. Great droid game!!! Very funny.  And price is worth of money spent."

924,Christian Schlosser,"January 22, 2014",4,Great fun. Different Funny. A different play style and easy to play in short bursts such as between tube stops. Only problem is it gets a little repetitive. But well worth the buy
925,Tommy van Uden,"December 8, 2012",5,"So much fun I loved this game, it's so much fun. The short cutscenes before each court battle make you realize how cocky Max actually is- the battle itself are puzzling, especially on hard mode. Lots of items to collect. Great game!"
926,Avelino Moreno,"March 26, 2013",5,"A full game! Isn't it amazing? A full game! Granted, it's short. But it's well done and very fun. One of the very few actual games for android/mobile devices of today."
927,Hannah Wright,"December 22, 2012",3,"Great fun. Good game, had me playing for hours without noticing...but did get a little boring, doing the same things each level. Not worth the price either, had better games for cheaper."
928,A Google user,"December 25, 2012",5,"Fun, Challenging, and Hilarious. The game is very fun and toward the end gives a good challenge on normal, making anyone think. Also, the sense of humor the developers have with the start, dialogs before cases, and the endings is my favorite part. Very funny game, worth the money."
929,Soutsada Ieng,"January 2, 2013",3,"Confused, is there more? So I've been playing for about a day, I've already bought all I can for my apartment. Am I supposed to upgrade soon? How do I get the other achievements and power ups? I'm kinda just ranking up my cash now. Yawn."

From the sarcastic insults to the intuitive game play to the style and finesse of the attorney,  everything is awesome about this game--not to mention the general vibe. One of the best games on the market if not the best.  Worth every dime. Please make more of such games."
931,Jason Shepherd,"September 1, 2013",4,Fun but short This game is great and real funny.  Problem is dont take long to win.  Please update and add more cases would make a good series
932,Clay Peterson,"November 28, 2013",2,Its to bad its so easy The look and feel of the game are great... and the humor is OK. However beyond the 80s frills their isn't much of a game.  The battles are insanely easy and of always felt like it needed one more element to be interesting

The game mechanics work similarly to games like Final Fantasy - in battle, you take turns trying to take out all your enemies, whilst outside of battle, you equip yourself with the best armours and weapons available for the next battle. Well there's a great emphasis on strategy here (as there's no grinding to speak of), and particularly on hard mode, you're going to need to plan long term and short term. Instead of weapons and armours, you equip yourself with designer furniture that's got more style than substance. Why? Because that's what immoral 80's snake-men do! Beneath it all, there's a tongue-in-cheek commentary of the 80's and the legal line of work. Well worth the money, my only minor complaints are that with such a great cast, I felt more could be done in terms of story, and there's a limited number of cases you can take - it's such a fun game that I'd like to be able to play it more!"
934,j hilaski II,"March 1, 2013",3,All around good game Only down falls...short and if you dont get every bonus in the cases you cant upgrade everything. A little repetitive. Once you beat it you prolly wont play it for some time.
935,A Google user,"November 13, 2013",4,Short But extremely Sweet Beatable in about 2 hours on setting and playing hardcore straight through this game has all the components of a high dollar production game.

936,Samantha Anderson,"January 3, 2013",3,Its good fun while it lasts I did enjoy this game however I completed it with 24 hours of having it. I hope they bring out additional cases otherwise it isn't worth the money and I bought it in the sale.

I got one ending (there's 3) and don't have the desire to replay it because I already know what cases are available. If there was a different path for the cases taken, do case A follow A path, perhaps I'd be more drawn in. Maybe  play as the other prosecutors. And failing a case equals only a restart. Boring.

941,A Google user,"June 15, 2013",2,"No new levels? It's been a great disappointment that a paid game with such a success has not had any new levels. The game was really great, but once you reach the last trial, there's nothing more to do."

994,David Stamp,"April 24, 2013",3,"Disappointing Fun but one dimensional take on turn based strategy. Love the genre, found this game a bit boring. Perhaps all the amazing reviews raised my expectations to high?!"
995,A Google user,"November 24, 2012",5,Addicting and tons of fun! Wow was not expecting this game to be this amazing the voice acting and  dialogue are top notch and not to mention hilarious.  Would recommend this game to anyone!
996,Joel Aquin,"January 8, 2013",4,Its fun Its fun but gets repetitive after awhile. Graphics are awesome and game play is OK. Just wish there was more to the game then your house or the lawyers office. All and all worth the .99 cents
997,Travis Tay,"August 19, 2013",4,Great game Really nice graphics and plot. But game is too short. Finished the whole game within 4-5hrs. Can u add more games if there's any future updates?
998,Matthew Carter,"January 12, 2013",2,"Way too easy Even on the most difficult setting the whole thing is beatable in a few hours. Not challenging. Some of the dialog is entertaining, but that's it."
999,K M,"December 20, 2012",5,Good game UPDATE- Awesome game. Great support.  Fun game. It froze in the middle of playing and had to uninstall to unpause/unfreeze it...this has occurred twice now. Lost all progress.
1000,Olivia Abassa,"February 10, 2013",4,Close but... I love this game but I wish it would sync with other devices. I've gotten super far on my tab but I have to start all over on my phone. Bummer
1001,Erika Dempsey,"December 8, 2013",3,Not what I expected This game is literally a turn based game as in u have a set amoubt of action points and u decide which skills to use to damage an opponent. If ur looking for a game where u can actually present evidence and argue why you think your client isnt guilty this is NOT for u
1002,Jason Bultemeyer,"January 2, 2013",5,"A blast to play! A simple, but very entertaining strategy game. An almost Leisure Suit Larry style-humor through the experience makes each case amusing, but the gameplay is easily accessible making it an enjoyable title for many ages."
1003,Philip Mauch,"December 24, 2012",2,"Too little for the $$ Fun concept, but for $3, it's way too short. Furnished my apartment in 20 min. Never lost a case. Game gets redundant really fast. Gameplay never changes."
1004,Matt Tiernan - EclecticMatt,"January 11, 2013",5,Top quality fun Really slick presentation - one of the best intro videos EVER - and deep enough gameplay to keep me going through the normal and hard campaigns. Really brilliant and well worth a few quid!
1005,Andy Shinn,"December 7, 2012",5,"Extremely well produced It is obvious a lot of time went in to the production of this game. The price is extremely fair for the sheer amount of content in the game alone. The game is not only fun, but also very entertaining."

Great graphics (looks ok on Nexus 7), responsive interface, and absolutely hilarious commentary from the game's characters.  I'd say this is definitely one of the Android store's polished gems.  I am hoping for future updates as I expect I will be playing this often end finishing the game sooner than I want."

Once you finish the game there is little desire to go back.   The game is very good and has a great sense of humor about it.  The mechanics are pretty easily understood.  Graphics are cartoony, but fit the 80s vibe."
1008,Otto Normalverbraucher,"January 29, 2013",5,Unique and professionally well made game Fun game with a unique concept. Funny voice acting with a ton of hillarious pop-culture references that usually only the middle-agers get who lived in the 1980's. Worth the money!
1009,Tianna Taylor,"March 23, 2013",5,Awesome Game ! I loved this game. Great graphics and story line. I wish there was a bit more to it or maybe you guys could make continuing parts? I feel like you could series this. Money well spent.
1010,A Google user,"November 25, 2012",4,"Good game, but short The game is a lot of fun, but can basically be finished in 2 mildly intensive days. A bit pricey for the little amount of gameplay."
1011,Ryan Jones,"July 15, 2013",2,"Comepleted in 1 day Really good game but painfully short, especially after paying over ¬£2 for it. Very disappointing."
1012,A Google user,"November 28, 2012",3,"Great concept, lacks depth Game is fun to start, turns into just an RPG style game, add ons, special powers, to defeat your opponents in a unique order.  Needs more to the game than this.  Beat in a day of moderate use, not really replayable."
1013,Phillip Liang,"February 6, 2013",5,"Fun and Witty If you like turned based strategy games, this ones for you. It took me about 3.5 hrs to beat the game and the shining point is the voice acting. I hope they make a part two."
1014,Daniel Cox,"January 17, 2013",5,Entertaining Probably the most entertaining and engaging game I have played. A little short but you can play again on various difficulties.
1015,Daniel Bagshawe,"December 30, 2012",5,"Great Game Fantastic way to relive the 80s. Sound, graphics and game play come together to create an enjoyable experience from start to finish.   It's a bit pricey for such a short game but on special it's absolutely worth it."
1016,Emmanuel Mbala,"January 4, 2013",5,Extremely fun I'm glad I got this game. Got me through about five or six hours of boredom.
1017,Matthew Kwong,"September 27, 2013",2,"This game is boring. It doesn't have the flare its trailer marketed. The story and game play is horrible, both lack insight and creativity. Couldn't stand 15 minutes of this."
1018,Brandon Clark,"January 3, 2013",4,"Great fun... But I beat it in a day and I'm not much of a gamer... it definitely kept me engaged, I just hoped for it to last a little longer."
1019,Karl Meaden,"December 6, 2012",5,So addictive! Love this game it's so simple bit totally addictive. And quite witty too. Only gripe is that the ending is a little weak.
1020,Terry- Ble,"December 31, 2012",5,"Short but fun This title is a steal at 99 cents.  The graphics, music, gameplay and acting are all high quality.  I'd love to see more cases and eventually a sequel. Compatibility is great among all my devices."
1021,Daniel Speth,"January 15, 2013",4,"Great game one problem Loved the game, couple of hours for fun. The one problem I have is once  beat the game you can't watch the end video again."
1022,A Google user,"January 1, 2013",5,"A great game This game is really entertaining and makes fun of any clich√©s about lawyers you can think of (cheesy word fights, Sun Tzu quotes, etc...).  The only downside: It's a bit short but that's fine because of its low price.  I hope that there'll be a sequel."

I dare anyone to show me where for under $5 where you can get more out of your purchase. The writing, in particular, is witty and topical, with tons of pop culture and classic movie referernces. There is no verbal or legal challenges, all number strategy and management, but it sucks you in. I WANT PART II NOW!!!!@"
1024,Lester Godsey,"December 28, 2012",2,Buggy in normal mode Worked fine in easy mode but in normal actions aren't completing during the trials. I hear the actions but don't see anything. It's to the point where restarting the trial doesn't work anymore.
1025,Leon Spencer,"January 2, 2013",5,"Brilliant humour! After reading some reviews I was worried about the length of the game, but I found this to be an excellent game, very witty cut scenes and it didn't feel too short, loved the 80s style music and references."

It combines strategy and skill in this very logical game. If you're into ""brain"" games in an adventure concept, this is the game for you. I liked the conversation between your character and the prosecutors before the trial because it added humor before the action begins haha. Please add more cases or another adventure mode to this. Since at the end he has many riches and fame and becomes very successful, maybe he can do cases with celebrities!:)"
1027,Joshua M.,"January 2, 2013",3,"A bit short A nice game that allows for some strategic thinking, but fairly easy to beat...not sure it's worth the price, even on sale...I don't think I'd play it all over again"
1028,Darren Kitamura,"January 4, 2013",5,Worth it. While on the shorter side and it did get a little repetitive it is still an absolutely amazing game and very much worth it. The voiceovers aren't great or bad by any standard and the game has a very polished feel to it.  I wish more games were up to this level.
1029,Imran Ali,"June 26, 2013",4,"Great game, but needs more. Awesome game, the storyline and everything made sense and was still fun at the same time. The only problem I have is that it is to short, it needs more cases and levels."
1030,Ben Hadden,"January 4, 2013",5,"Great app Its a really fun game. I was having problems downloading the app and the developer responded extremely quickly, resolving the problem :-) great service."
1031,Scylla Charybdis,"January 12, 2013",4,"Great so far I enjoyed this game; it stands up to repeat playings due to multiple levels of difficulty and badges to earn. The bonus minigame was a fun challenge, too. More levels, please!"
1032,Robert G,"September 21, 2014",2,"""Sale"" I like this game. I've owned it for a long time and I've installed and uninstalled multiple times to replay it. But this ""sale"" thing on the icon is shady as hell, it's not on sale, that's just the regular price, sales don't last for months on end."
1033,Daniel B,"December 16, 2012",5,"An instant favorite Really enjoyed this game, couldn't put it down until I had finished it on my first sitting.   The dialogue, voice work and graphics were top notch, certainly waiting to see if any further content ever gets produced for this title."
1034,Mark Scholbrock,"January 9, 2013",3,"Meh Decent game. Little replay value and kind of dopey 'stories' with each case. Good idea, but short. Not worth $3. Maybe $1."
1035,Alan Wrasse,"January 8, 2013",4,Good not great. In the beginning its pretty good but after awhile its more or less the same thing over and over. Gave it 4 stars because it's fun for awhile.
1036,Ben Saxon,"December 29, 2012",4,"Great, if a little short Good game that puts a legal twist on turn-based battle games. The voice acting is hugely enjoyable and the campy 80s materialism throughout is a really nice touch."
1037,Richard Mal,"November 27, 2012",2,"Too easy This game was a bit too easy. I finished the game in about two hours, so nor really value for money. But well developed, and interesting concept."
1038,Matt Massey,"January 5, 2013",4,"Good. It just misses... something. I'm not sure what.  I know, difficult to understand. But it's equally hard to explain correctly!"
1039,Marjie Volk,"July 15, 2013",4,High polish and amusing This game looks and sounds great. It has memorable characters and amusing dialog. The gameplay itself is a bit repetitive but it definitely entertained me for several hours
1040,Sean Socoloski,"May 5, 2013",5,Great game Lots of fun and a lot of content. One of the best made mobile games I've played. Hope for a sequel or update with more missions!
1041,Joshua Smith,"November 29, 2012",3,So much potential. Fun while it lasts.  Way too short for $3 and a narrative at the end of a case would be much better than the newspaper. The concept of the game and the actual execution of the game is awesome. I'd pass it until an update unless you won't miss the $3 bucks.
1042,michelle c.,"January 2, 2013",4,"Really fun but short. I got it at the sale price and really enjoyed it. I definitely suggest downloading it but like i said in the title, its too short. If they update it to add more levels I'll change it to 5 stars."
1043,Mike Chevalier,"April 1, 2014",4,"Great but too short I agree with a lot of the reviewers that, while tons of fun, the game was too short. Worth the sale price but questionable at full price."
1044,A Google user,"January 14, 2013",3,"Ehhhh, Fair at best. Game play is repetitive, gets boring. Not really with the money."
1045,Valerie Jordan,"December 4, 2012",3,"Pretty boring Although you have to put a bit of thought into playing this game, it is pretty basic stuff. Not sufficiently entertaining to make me want to play again. If I had tried a free version I wouldn't have parted with any cash to upgrade"
1046,Andy Renfer,"December 14, 2012",5,I'll allow it I have never seen a game like this. It is challenging to begin with but after a couple of upgrades I feel like a master defense attorney. Defiantly worth a buy.
1047,Jerry D,"September 13, 2013",5,"fun game i got this and finished it in two days, had a blast while doing so, my only complaint is i wish it lasted a little longer. but all in all a good value for the cost."
1048,A Google user,"November 17, 2012",5,Sony Go Very interesting game I actually clear it in just 2 days. So if the developers can put more apartment and cases it would be awesome :-)
1049,Daan McHugh,"December 4, 2013",4,Great Great game but glitched. Now unplayable! Other wise would have given it a 5. Quite frustrating!
1050,Carron Davies,"December 22, 2012",3,Could be longer Good game but could be more rooms to upgrade and different levels..  Think its overpriced for the lenght of it
1051,Derek O'Brien,"January 2, 2013",5,So well done Excellent strategic play. Great on galaxy tab 2 10.1. Funny dialogues with challenging in game scenarios. If only there were more cases!
1052,Patricia Mango,"December 30, 2012",3,"Pretty funny, but... I really liked the banter and the idea behind the game, but the jokes about feminism were frustrating. Would like it a lot more if you cut that."

1057,Calvin Smith-L'√âcuyer,"May 24, 2013",5,"One of my favorites I have a huge collection of mobile games and this is one of the best I have played.  Fun game play,  upgrades and skills make long term play rewarding, it auto saves if you need to step away, so you're never losing progress, and turn based combat makes it ideal for mobile.   Great purchase."
1058,Jim Stewart,"December 2, 2012",5,A fun time waster I spent way too much time playing this quirky Turn Based strategy game.  It was fun and kept me entertained.  I thought the length was decent and the price was fair.
1059,Eduardo Guizar jr,"March 23, 2014",5,Best Android game to date Just a fresh breath from the mundane games found in the app store. A definite buy for those looking for a fun and new game for Android.   Just waiting for the sequel now.

1064,A Google user,"November 26, 2012",2,Ok game The game played is ok but incredibly easy. Voice acting is pretty good but the actual writing is subpar and sometimes borderline nonsensical. Add to the above that the game is over in under 3 hours and that you pay for the game. Fun - but not worth it.
1065,Kim Nguyen,"June 16, 2013",5,Super awesome fun I laughed at about 98% of the dialogue and they actually do accurately portray lawyers! Thanks for the best game for $3!
1066,Evan Pascoe,"February 5, 2013",4,"Great Game Great game, if a bit short.  Fun to play and with multiple difficulty settings you can extend your playtime some."

1068,A J,"December 29, 2012",2,Shallow and weak There is simply no challenge or meaningful gameplay in this game. Even on sale I felt that Ipaid too much for it. A shame.

1070,Roberto Carrillo,"February 4, 2013",5,"Very nicely made I had a lot of fun with this game. If I had to complain, I'd say the storyline is a little flat."
1071,Bryn Barker,"January 1, 2013",5,Amazing This is probably the best game on the Play Store. The presentation seems impossible for a mobile game. My only criticism is that it ends.
1072,Brad Reiter,"May 12, 2013",5,"Excellent RPG Experience At it's core, this game is a RPG, but without the exploration / adventure element.  You can jump in play a few matches (cases) immediately.  This is why it is so great for a mobile game."
1073,Nabeel Ahmed,"January 4, 2013",3,"Okay but!!!!!!!! I was expecting that I would fight cases knowing what they are about and use my brain. This game is like a Pokemon, turn based game with no thought involved."
1074,A Google user,"November 25, 2012",5,Love it! Its a great game I love the whole concept. The only thing that would make it better is a little more dialogue during the trials.
1075,Alex Leonovich,"April 20, 2013",5,I LOVE THIS GAME!!! I've played it for about two hours and i was scared that it was going to be repetitive and it sort of is but it's ok because the gameplay is so fun

1078,Landon Francis,"January 15, 2013",5,This game is amazing This game was challenging and funny at the same time. It required some thinking to beat some prosecutors but it was fun. It'll be great if there is an update with more levels and challenges to face
1079,Harvey Carlsmith,"May 17, 2013",5,"Great. This game is fun, too short, but fun. Really, this game could use several hundred cases to solve and for the cost you would think they could do so."

I can't put it down and it looks and plays great both on my phone and tablet. I just wish there was a way to sync the game between the two devices so I could continue playing on both."
1104,K. Yo,"January 25, 2013",3,expensive game is too easy and while its enoyable... i feel ripped off. can be finished in a few hours. do not worth $3ÔºÅmore like .99
1105,Jake Thomas,"January 1, 2013",5,"Awesome! I'm not big on rating, but this game is great. Max is a sarcastic comedian. Heh heh. Get this game!"
1106,A Google user,"November 28, 2012",5,"High quality. Nuff said From the intro animation and fully stylized and professional sound track, to the character design and awesome voice acting, the game oozes quality. It's a humorous simple strategy game"
1107,Tracy Fisher,"January 25, 2014",5,"Good, solid game The graphics were well done, the game was funny and amusing yet required skill.  I loved being able to update my attorney and figure out how to win cases.  We do need more levels - a Chapter 2, or next generation but only because the game was so well done, I just want more!"
1108,Steve Baluchi,"May 4, 2013",3,"Not sure what all the fuss is about The game is polished and the eighties vibe is fun, but the gameplay is limited to almost a final fantasy style of combat. Would have much preferred dialogue choices to take cases forward (although appreciate this would be a LOT more coding!)"
1109,Nick Myers,"December 6, 2012",5,"Great game This game is well worth the 3 bucks. Nothing out there like it, looks great on my gs3."

1111,Lee Smith,"January 4, 2013",2,Too short and repetitive Fun for about 30 mins. Addictive but boring. Completed in 3 hours. Glad I didn't pay full price for it.

1114,Anastasiya Verevkina,"December 8, 2012",5,Awesome This game is amazing! Loved the jokes and overall atmosphere. I believe many users would definitely want it to be longer.

1118,Brandon Kelley,"January 3, 2013",5,Nexus 7 Fun game. Turn based court battles were interesting and somewhat challenging.  I wish there were more customizable choices though.
1119,Odin Hiem,"August 2, 2013",1,It stopped. I feel like it just stops. Fix ur place up and done. Please update with new cribs/areas.
1120,Initial K,"November 28, 2012",5,"Very well done! Excellent game, very addictive especially since you can finish each ""battle"" in under 5 minutes. Voice acting is much better than most games, and fits well with the characters. Highly recommended to anyone, especially rpg nuts looking for something different."
1121,Arjun Paul,"September 5, 2014",5,Need a new update It is very weird that the developers are not coming up with new cases nd storyline. Love thus gane but need an update..
1122,Christina Yin,"February 3, 2013",3,But It started out great but got boring soon afterwards since game play is repetitive. Yawn.
1123,Chelsea Frenette,"February 3, 2014",5,"Awesome and hillarious Great graphics, smooth game play.  Fun and challenging.   The cut scenes are really funny.

1126,Aaron de la Cruz,"June 25, 2013",4,"Great but short! Overall a very entertaining game. As far as mobile gaming goes, this is one turn based strategy game that won't disappoint. With all the levels and ability to customize, the player is never left without an objective. Only improvement I can suggest is to add more levels!"
1127,Peter Aleshin,"January 3, 2013",5,Amazing game Interesting story wish there was more. Such a fun game well worth it. I usually would not spend more then a dollar pet game but this one is a winner.

1131,Nick Houston,"January 6, 2013",5,"Honestly, some more content would make this absolutely perfect This is a wonderfully well done, all I can ask for is more. Please make some more content! More cases, more upgrades, more skills, and maybe some more core dynamics."
1132,Henry Forrest,"May 27, 2013",3,"Where's the rest of it Fun and well thought out game, but completed it within 2 days... Where is the rest of it?? More levels please. Don't expect a game that is not free to be do limited"

1135,Zoe Teoh,"June 16, 2014",5,"One of the best games I have ever played. Both intellectually stimulating and hilarious, a few dollars is a small price to pay for this gem. Albeit, it is a short game that can be completed in a day or two, but I'd take quality over quantity any day. Looking forward to the sequel, if there will be one."
1136,The Almighty Beard,"December 11, 2012",5,"Enjoyable time waster! Needs more levels i have beaten it 4 times now, time flys when i play, more levels please!"

1149,Jenna Westfall,"June 13, 2014",5,"Guilty Pleasure The dialogue was beyond witty and amusing (loved the little references too)animations and voice acting smooth and appealing, and boasts a unique turn-based combat system which forces strategic thinking and prioritizing. Overall, great game."
1150,Matthew Ebert,"March 28, 2014",5,"Perfect funny game. It is a fairly challenging game with a little skill involved. The sorry it's charming and funny, but I'm sad to see it end. Characters are loveable and I'm sad to see them go. It's hard to find good characters and voice actors that fit and speak like they are the character."

It is worth the money and with the amazing plot I'm sure you'll enjoy just as much as I did.

1172,Anthony Oviedo,"January 15, 2013",5,"Great and Simple, Yet Challenging A great game. The concept is simple but it does challenge you at times. I do wish there were more cases. Some if the cases are just straight up hilarious and I do hope for more. Keep it coming!"
1173,A Google user,"August 14, 2013",5,"Love it! Brilliant game!! It's only short if you play it all in one go, otherwise it can last for a few weeks. There should be a part 2, I loved the characters and the storyline.  Probably my favourite android game out there!"
1174,T Rapacki,"January 4, 2013",5,High Production values Great dialogue and sound. Strategy gameplay is a little shallow but still satisfying. Short. Easily worth the $1 it costs on sale. A bit of a stretch for 3.

It's not too often you see turn-based strategy games nowadays (usually it's RTS or TD), but I've always preferred TBS.  It doesn't hurt that it's based in the decade I grew up in, so it really invokes a sense of nostalgia for me.  That said, there are some minor issues:  1. The main character, Max, isn't very funny himself.  Sometimes he has a good line or two, but more often than not, he comes off sounding like a conceited jerk.  It's hard to like the protagonist when his opponents are more likeable.  2.  I realize it's the 80s, so bright colors are par for the course, but sometimes those colors make the text difficult to read.  3.  The worst problem is the absolutely tiny text.  Maybe this game is better on a tablet, but with a smartphone (which has a 4.7"" screen) the text can sometimes be so small my eyes get exhausted.  If the text scaled along with the screen size and resolution or if there was an option to set text size itself, that'd help a lot."

1222,Miran Omanovic,"December 31, 2013",5,One word... legen.... wait for it dary. Very creative game and excelent realization. Witty dialogs and character development. A must play. Would like to see new cases posiblly with mabeline.

1225,Alice Chatman,"January 22, 2013",3,Boring and repetitive It's not as funny as people say I feel it's way to repetitive and there should be more. Not worth $3
1226,Lacey 3825,"March 10, 2013",3,"Awesome but beat it quicklyand NEEDS MORE LEVELS!!! Exactly what i said above. Awesome game and challenging but with so few levels ive already been put ""on holiday"" for way to long now!!!!"

1229,Dave Schmidt,"October 19, 2014",5,"High quality fun This game has great production value, and is a lot of fun. Voice acting and animation is top notch, and the cases are short enough to play in a few minutes each. More than worth the asking price."
1230,tien cya,"May 15, 2013",5,"dont skip the dialogue while the game play is fun, it's all in the bells and whistles.  don't skip the dialogues and do read the cases: that's where all the LOLs are."

1235,Tim Bishop,"February 3, 2014",5,Excellent turn based game This is a great game when you don't have much time for gaming. I play it 15 minutes at a time but I have also played for an hour. Either way if you like turn based stratagey that is out of the norm this is the game.
1236,Jim Bravo,"January 3, 2013",5,"Great game, surprisingly challenging The game takes a bit to get going, but really begins to take a little bit of effort during the 2nd act. It could be longer, but I'm hoping for an expansion of some in the future."

I understand you may not want to voice act any more intros so just leave that to story mode and make us a random mode. The other aspect that could be improved next time is actually have the lawyer read rhe case note aloud when hes in his office."
1245,Jerimee Richir,"May 25, 2013",5,"Addictive fun. Excellent value game. About 3 hours of solid fun. Not much replay, but a fun story and a well executed ""card fighting"" mechanic."

1247,Amanda P,"March 13, 2014",5,Worth the money! I love this game...great graphics and storyline; the theme song alone is worth the download. I can't wait for a sequel! More so I would love to see a cartoon develop from this game...look out adult swim!!
1248,Jake Williams,"August 4, 2014",2,Terrible All you do is part pick options to get rid of the courts points I were expecting something a little more detailed.

1250,Amin Jalali,"September 11, 2013",4,Nice but short I wish it was longer The demo they would show before each level was very funny though and I looked forward to watching it every time
1251,A Google user,"January 4, 2013",5,"Great game for a mobile This is one of those perfect little mobile games with simple controls and entertaining gameplay. Easy to play for a few minutes on a bus ride, our for hours during free time."
1252,Travis Porter,"February 10, 2013",5,"A quality game I'm genuinely impressed by this game. It's fun, which is always great, but also well made. The voices and expressive faces make each trial something to look forward to."
1253,Tric√©,"December 30, 2012",4,Nice fun Would like a nice continuation of the game after beating the final opponent. Different storyline begins depending on choice of final scene.

1264,Braddah1,"January 4, 2013",3,Good but short =/...The game is great but its really short. Maybe an update allowing more cases should be made?
1265,Tyler Birchfield,"January 15, 2013",1,Repetitive and boring Noooo idea how this made top games of 2013.  Not fun at all... Maybe worth $0.01
1266,Richard Leung,"December 31, 2012",3,Gets boring quick.. Not challenging one bit... too easy to beat and losing just means retrying...
1267,Brandon Paterak,"January 2, 2013",4,"Great game Kept me interested, very polished but too short. Worth the discounted price atm (99) but I don't think I'd pay any more"

1270,Scott Kennedy,"January 11, 2013",1,No sound Don't play sound in the splash  screen if I've turned off sound AND the phone is in silent mode...
1271,Jack Nikolaidis,"January 11, 2013",3,"Great Game Great game but graphics are still pretty pixelated on edges and scaling feels odd, more like a blown up phone app than one optimized for 10"" tablets."
1272,Mark Limb,"April 12, 2013",4,Worth the money Fun game but fairly simplistic game play and a bit short.  It's light entertainment for a couple of bucks and is worth the money.
1273,Andrew Jarick,"December 30, 2012",5,Love it It reminds me of an old DOS game. Well made and heaps of humerus dialogue. Got to love the main character. Game play is addictive and will keep you playing for hours!
1274,Gerald Marchant,"January 14, 2013",5,Great Game Good humour and variety of skills. Not enough levels or opportunities to upgrade enough skills. Please produce more levels at least 100+
1275,Andy,"April 12, 2013",2,Buggy Works fine till 15th case then bus out. Says i have no action points. Then days i have 1967 points instead of 9.but i can't use them. Uninstalled within 24 hours. Sorry.

1281,Comrade VISIXVI,"December 9, 2012",5,"Awesome Game!!! I'm a core gamer. I've bought a few mobile titles, but none like this. The Devils Attorney is by far the funnest.  Worth every penny of the three bucks asking price.  BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1282,A Google user,"May 4, 2013",5,My favorite More cell phone games need to be this fun. You can tell the developers enjoyed making it and didnt just push it out for money. A must have!
1283,Jazz B.,"January 5, 2013",5,Samsung Galaxy S3 The title discouraged me from purchasing this at first but it was worth the buy.

1288,A Google user,"August 27, 2013",5,"Epic. This is the best Android game I've played so far. It defines it's own genre: funny, good lookin, with a challenge, and some story to tell. Worth every penny of it's price."
1289,Narat Suchartsunthorn,"February 22, 2014",4,Fun to play but quite a short game The game was fun with story and gameplay. But it might not worth a full payment because of its short story that you can finish in one or two hours.
1290,israel campos,"February 11, 2013",5,Great!! Loved this game. Was so good I beat it in one sitting. Just wish they would update with new trials.
1291,gardner humphreys,"April 6, 2013",3,Not all that Has good graphics and some funny lines but the gameplay is way too repetitive and simple.
1292,Liam J,"October 20, 2014",5,Awesome I love this game. It is one of my favorites. The only problem is it ends too quickly. I wish there was more content. Other than that 5\5
1293,Tiffany Brown,"January 1, 2013",1,Not impressed I finished the whole game in two days :( not worth the money.
1294,Rob Tokar,"January 7, 2013",2,"Not worth a buck This is a dressed up kids game, no skill required, dissapointed big time,"
1295,Zachary Hudgens,"January 2, 2013",3,"Decent game, but repetitive The first level is fun, by the second and third are the same, minus a few skills. Only bought for .99, so for that, it was an okay buy."

1301,Jenn Managi,"January 3, 2014",3,Fun game but not enough levels You level up fairly quickly and the game is soon over.  It's not random enough to provide much difference by replaying
1302,martina P,"November 24, 2013",1,Boring Made the mistake of not checking what type of game I thought it was about interactive trials and law but its just weird boring
1303,Jeff,"January 28, 2014",3,Amusing and cute Not enough cases. Finished all difficulties in about an hour.
1304,Ming Kwong,"January 9, 2013",5,"Awesome game and great support. Great support from the devs. Couldn't download the game at first but soon after I reported the issue.

1307,Mark Kallenborn,"January 5, 2013",5,"Awesome game! Really makes the time pass by and pulls you into the game almost instantly. The down side was that the game was a bit short, I hope there's a sequel in the works!"
1308,Trinidad Morales,"April 6, 2013",5,"Awesome game. This game is truly a well made game. I loved the dialogue, the strategic element, and numerous humor moments. I only wish there could be more android games as polished in every aspect as this game is."

1315,Kirsty-Leigh,"December 30, 2012",3,Boring Doing the same thing on the cases got boring and the upgrades on the apartment too
1316,Paul Lammertsma,"December 29, 2012",5,Hilarious fun Cute puzzle game (with a bit of a luck factor) that's incredibly well made. Cases are interspersed by a funny story and this game is simply beautifully made. Well worth a few euros.
1317,Logan A. Curley,"December 5, 2012",5,Fun I want more! Great games funny. I wish there was a sequel or add-on with post trial animations. 3$ is totally fair priced. Good balance of strategy and storyline.

1320,A Google user,"November 25, 2012",1,"Just another level up game. It has a very nice high polish, looks and sounds great. BUT, You don't get close to anything that simulates you being a lawyer? It just has you tapping away at their (H P) meter. I am giving it a 1 star rating, because of extreme blunt effort in it actually being a lawyer game. I want my money back."
1321,A Google user,"March 8, 2020",4, Good game once u can get it. Kinda hard some if

1331,Gabe Karl,"December 30, 2012",5,Great game I like how the gameplay works and it's similar to other RPG card games ... Also the quips between characters are nice ... The homage to the 1990's sensibilities is funny
1332,Darren Middleton,"December 5, 2012",4,"Fun but short. The game was very enjoyable but far too short, as I completed it within a couple of hours. Will upgrade to 5 stars if more levels added."
1333,Brad R,"December 30, 2012",5,"Well Worth 5 Bucks or More One of the most entertaining, enjoyable games I've ever played on a phone. I'd give it six stars if I could!"

1335,Riley Dedini,"December 4, 2012",5,Fantastic game! Definitely worth it I'm hooked. Bought it and couldn't put it down. Will certainly look to buy any other games by the developers with this style
1336,Robin C. M. Staple,"March 26, 2013",4,"Great game, but very short It's a great game, absolutely loved it, but was quite disappointed at how short it is. You can play this through in half a day or less."

1344,E V,"December 28, 2012",3,Way to short The game is really fun but for $3 I would of wanted it to be longer. Also it would kind of be fun to go back and play the game with everything you already bought.
1345,Daniel V,"November 19, 2013",5,Very fun I thought it would be sort of like Phoenix Wright but it's more like JRPG turn-based combat but it holds its own because it's so fun and amusing
1346,Daniel Leon,"December 30, 2012",4,"Cool game Very amusing, short and may become kind of repetitive, though."
1347,A Google user,"November 26, 2012",4,"Very Polished but Short Game Play While this is a perfectly polished turn-based game, it's game play is too limited and the whole game can be considered within a matter of a few hours, with nothing left but re-playing with different difficulty levels and slight variations in items purchased."
1348,Ricky Von Ricky,"January 28, 2013",5,Seper addictive! I can play this game for hours straight. I beat the game 3 times to see the different scenarios. Look's amazing on my Samsung Note 2

1368,Yousaf Khan,"January 9, 2013",2,Very repetitive game This game gets so repetitive after the first 2 cases. You do the following: Chose case. Do a small 2-3 min. mini game. Get paid. Buy furniture to boost your stats. Repeat.
1369,Clarissa Javes,"December 10, 2012",4,"Good :) Graphics are good, not an unfair price for a good game. It's managed to get me engrossed, which is rare for me."

1393,wu jiejun,"December 5, 2012",4,"Great game. I too short too easy. Great idea and game play. The cases were wayyy too easy and if it was developed a little less linear, it might have made the game more interesting."
1394,A Google user,"January 5, 2013",5,Definitely fun for $1 Was expecting a Phoenix Wright type game but this is more of an RPG. But it's cleverly written and definitely worth the $1 sale price.

Most of the cut scenes display a great, clean sense of humour, and the gameplay itself is really enjoyable. The game really does require you to look for the weaknesses in the prosecutor's offence and you have to discredit the the most damaging evidence/witnesses first before they harm your case.

It has a great, whimsical art style, funny descriptions of each defendant's crime, and character portraits that are totally dead pan. The actual game play is solid, and while it starts out very easy, you soon have to really think cases through and decide what to attack first, how to avoid damage, etc. My only complaint is that the game always starts with the music blaring and only shuts it off after I've opened my profile. I would prefer the option to turn off the game's music and sound effects for the entire game and not just for a specific profile. If Android let me set the volume off for all games that would be great but until then developers need to realize that some of us NEVER want game sounds to emanate from our phones."

Yes its just 58 cases but its worth the cost.

2304,A Google user,"October 29, 2012",5,"Excellent.. really well made. I love the great references to the 80s, the wit and polish of the game. The game play and fun factor is superb. A great balance of strategy and challenge. Hope that there is more to come."
2305,A Google user,"November 2, 2012",5,"Good, polished title A fun, quirky game with lots of polish. The gameplay is simple and not incredibly deep, but the storyline makes this a very enjoyable 2-3h"
2306,A Google user,"March 10, 2013",5,"Very fun, a bit short I loved the game play, my only complaint is that it didn't last very long. I would love a sequel!"
2307,A Google user,"November 5, 2012",5,"Fun and humorous Yeh the gameplay is pretty simple, but its still challenging and fun choosing your abilities to make a wining strategy. Loved the 80`s vibe and the dialogue is great, and forms a pretty entertaining story. Nice to see a mobile game with style and personality"
2308,A Google user,"October 28, 2012",5,Best game ever! I can't get enough of this game! Max really makes me laugh.
2309,A Google user,"November 5, 2012",4,Awsome but short Loved playing this game. The story and dialogue is real fun to listen.  But too short and easy. Also the money and customization isnt really difficult or fun to do. Still a good added feature but definitely a recommended game.  I cant wait to see future games from this developper
2310,A Google user,"November 3, 2012",5,awesomeness I like his witty comebacks and the funny cases and can't wait too see what this game has to offer in the future.
2311,A Google user,"November 7, 2012",3,"Not SUPER good It is a good idea that I feel could have been delivered a little bit better. Game play is great, sound, dialog is charming. But needs more options for customizing the apartment. For the price I feel more needs to be involved. Other than that it runs great on my s3."
2312,A Google user,"October 30, 2012",4,"Good Game It is a good game though needs an effective way to close the game. When clising & then reopening, its like the game never actually closed on this SGS2 ... Otherwise its funny & has everything going for it.. Cant wait to see the updates... Lol"
2313,A Google user,"November 25, 2012",5,"Awesome Way too good than this has any right to be. The voice acting is great, the dialogue is funny, and the music and art has an addicting retro charm to it. Gameplay is a simple turn based rpg, but can have a nice level of strategy as well."
2314,A Google user,"November 8, 2012",5,Great fun I love how you have to beat your opponent in strategy. Then spending your hard earned money! Brilliant fun game! Sequel please!!

I wish there were more cases, and I wouldn't mind paying more for a chapter 2 or 3. All in all, Max is da man."
2423,Sarumane San,"January 2, 2013",5,Only at cheaper price! I wouldn't have paid full price. The game is to short and strategies are repetitive. At this price it's been a fun 2 hours. Then went back through for the pimp hat! Five at this price of 70p.
2424,Alissa Hamilton,"February 3, 2013",3,Cannot install. Thanks for the great tech support and the fast refund when it still wouldnt work on my device! Won't even install on my galaxy.

2425,Daniel Meise,"May 31, 2013",2,"Too easy, repetitive, and not particularly imaginative. I don't understand the rave reviews, really.  It is well polished, but other than that fairy lackluster.  I would say it is too short, but that would imply I wanted to keep playing."
2426,A Google user,"March 11, 2013",1,This is bullshitbullshit Don't buy this it's a waste of money......  lamest game ever it's not what you think it is....  more like a Pokemon battle game..... if that's what your into then buy it but it's very misleading
2427,A Google user,"November 4, 2012",5,"It has humor on it. I complete this game 3 times each day and I never get bored of it. However, it is too short. So, I am looking forward a sequel."
2428,Matthew Ferguson,"March 4, 2013",2,"It used to be good... This game used to be one of the best games around but due to lack of support from the developer (not making more levels etc) it's rapidly gone down hill. At the time I'm glad I paid for the game because it was fun and I thought more things to do would be added. Now, I regret the purchase entirely."

My only problems is that there's barely any replay value (besides the endings but that's too much effort) and sometimes the voice and subtitles would be out of sync, resulting in skipping.   Other than that, it was a fun ride. I don't even mind that I missed out on the sale."
2430,nick probert,"January 7, 2013",4,"Its okay, not amazing. Better than average Yeah it sounds better than it'd going to be. The dialogue is actually pretty funny, but the game / strategy is easy. Still though, entertaining. No replay value."

2437,Joshua Roozendaal,"January 1, 2013",4,"Decent game Bought it on sale, well worth the price. Surprisingly good voice acting. Found a bug, though, where you select an action, select the person or object and the action menu just freezes. But other than that, fame works fine."
2438,Gabriel Larke,"November 27, 2012",4,"Reganomics! This is a good little game. I like the 80's theme, great artwork, and amusing back and forth between the attorneys. The only problem is that the game is a little short and there's not much replay value. I'm hoping the developer adds more cases."
2439,Sanu Prodsathaporn,"December 31, 2012",5,Pro: Great fun and hilarious! Con: too short :-( The game is very very fun and challenging. You will have to rethink your strategy every now and then!

Your attacks are courtroom moves, your health is your credibility, and your opponents are witnesses, evidence, and the opposing attorney. It's got enough complexity where you need to think about what you're doing instead of blindly mashing damage attacks, but I was able to beat just about every case with the bonus condition on the first or second try, so it is kind of easy (on normal).   Beyond that, though, the writing and VA is hilarious, especially for a mobile game. I found myself choosing particular cases over others because I knew certain characters were going to show up and I wanted to hear the rest of their story. The music and art style is '80s-fantastic as well."
2468,Something Something,"June 15, 2013",3,"Please add more cases! Fun game, very well made. Zero replay value. I'd give it five stars if they ever updated it with cases or levels or whatever.
