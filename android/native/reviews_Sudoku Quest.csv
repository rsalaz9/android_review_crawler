I really dig the style and the colors are very helpful, by far the most goodlooking sudoku app in the market. But even if I love challenges, I'd love to have a gamemode without the timer, that allows me to just enter and do some sudokus without feeling that extra pressure and becoming stressful instead of enjoyable. Different moods, different game modes. Congrats to the devs :)"

I am fairly quick at sudoku but I cant go fast enough which makes it no longer fun. The timer should either be increased or have an option if you want to play that way or not. I had deleted it once before and thought I would try again but I see nothing is different. Plus it doesnt want to load now. Really really want to be able to give it 5 stars... I just cant with that timer."
2,Ruma Adhikary,"March 27, 2020",4, The game is good but I guess the coins and gems should be also used for other things too and not for only continuing the level or getting extra time.(Only for suggestions:- Like buying new boards or something like that the gems or coins can be used).I hope the creators will understand what I am tryi...Full ReviewThe game is good but I guess the coins and gems should be also used for other things too and not for only continuing the level or getting extra time.(Only for suggestions:- Like buying new boards or something like that the gems or coins can be used).I hope the creators will understand what I am trying to say. Otherwise the game exciting.
3,Anna Elder,"April 18, 2020",5, Fun and colorful! Only drawback is that it is a little awkward to get used to removing/deleting numbers in error and using the pencil-in notepad.
4,DB,"February 25, 2020",5, Great variety of puzzles and challenge of time restraint. I appreciate that you can go backnon a level and improve your time. I haven't experienced any glitches and it is my go to favorite.
5,Angel Collins,"February 15, 2020",1, I've uninstalled this game bc it's too hard to tell the squares apart. I found a different one that is much easier to tell. Let me know when you make the lines stick out more.
6,Janhvi Das,"February 19, 2020",3," Its a very nice game i love it , even it is so easy to play but their are so many levels in it i am playing it from 3 months but it is not ending"
7,DJ Kaipat,"March 24, 2020",4, Quite an experience. Tricky at first due to the way it was set up but it is great. Good job developers
8,Rachelle Erickson,"April 7, 2020",5, Great so far! I've never done sudoku like this. Its a good variety!
9,John McGonigle,"April 2, 2020",4, Nice time filler the puzzles are challenging but possible.
10,joshuaisemperor,"February 16, 2020",4, Love the game only a bummer that there isnt a timeless mode or something.
11,Wayne Playford,"March 27, 2020",5, Salright be better with out the bright colours and better lines between the squares
12,christina Williams,"April 10, 2020",5, The game works a whole lot better since the update. Thanks hashcube!

This game is addicting and challenging, love it! I was almost to level 300 and enjoyed this game until it started me over at the beginning!!! I have sent multiple emails to support for over 2 weeks now and they don't seem to help. I have all of my coins and gems, but level 5?!?! Going to uninstall if it doesn't get fixed really soon."

I am unable to get back in even though I'm close to solving. Please fix this. The update also made the numbers so small at times you can't tell which number is which or whether that number is correct unless you use a cell check hint. Will update review when this issue is fixed."

No way for experienced solvers to skip ahead, no option to turn off error checking. (It will not let you make a mistake.) Number buttons show how many left to place. Default interface is select a number and then place it, but can switch to select cell first. Color coding of numbers can be turned off. I'd like the bars dividing the grids to be thicker."
18,Belinda Robinson,"January 10, 2020",4," Really enjoy playing. Lots of different puzzles, so always look forward to new puzzle when l do solve one in allocated time. I am unsure if why we collect coins. The jewels can be used to obtain extra time, but the coins don't seem to be used for anything. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
19,Miguel Rodriguez,"March 20, 2020",4, Fun and simple to use
20,Juanita Cox,"April 20, 2020",5, Love working my mind and that's what this game do for me. thanks
21,GAURAV AGRAWAL,"January 28, 2020",3, Nice..all starts from basics but need to improve.. There is no comptation with other players
22,Alex Cerdan,"November 25, 2019",3, Game is simple and quick. The only issue I have is puzzle 10 is wrong. The twos cross and should technically not be solvable.
23,Catherine Chan-Bhanushali,"January 8, 2020",3," The levels are virtually impossible to solve on time going into level 600 and above. The time limits for some levels are so small, it isn't feasible to solve them"
24,Storm Reign,"April 14, 2020",5, Love this game layout. Motivating.
25,Faith Aldridge,"December 18, 2019",5, I absolutely love this game. Its switch-up of layouts for the sudoku games keeps it interesting and the powerups and view make it even more fun!
26,Tracy Farebrother,"February 3, 2020",4, A game to help pass time when you want to do mindless games.
27,Shavanti Hiles,"February 12, 2020",5, Okay i guess could use a better story mode and way to earn gems. Also im still trying to figure out what exactly are coins spent on... Lol
28,MANSI SHIVHARE,"April 16, 2020",5, Colourful interface Good game
29,Casey Dixon,"November 24, 2019",5, I like that it starts out slow and shows the over lapping puzzle. Never seen one of those.
30,Cori Unland,"March 5, 2020",4, Fun. Timer makes it a challeng!
31,Anne L J,"January 1, 2020",5," It's different from what I used to play, but love the style and makes it even harder because it has a timer."
32,QueenB Bella,"January 11, 2020",5," So fun and amazing. I enjoy playing it, just wish it wasnt timed cuz i find sudoku a relaxing game."
33,Kiepie,"January 21, 2020",1, Have to push number 10 times to get it to work at times. Makes you run out of time.
34,Robert Visness,"November 14, 2019",3, Doesn't give enough time to solve puzzles...should at least be same puzzle when try again
35,Bendy the bread Minecart,"January 15, 2020",4, When picking the square and what number to put in it lags a little but it's still a very fun game
36,Emily Robertson,"November 19, 2019",3, The game is fun enough. There are a lot of ads and it's timed.
37,Rampa Menua,"February 12, 2020",5, So good quest of mathematical sudoku. So much fun to solve every puzzle given.

43,Stacy Palmer,"March 15, 2020",5," Fay, fun and lots of strategy"
44,Janice Babbington,"December 26, 2019",5, Love it It makes you think plus there are different puzzles

I like the variant sizes of puzzles but the forced 10sec+ ads with tiny close buttons and constant harassment to use powerups if you stop filling squares for about 5 seconds is ridiculous. I understand that you have to make money but the constant nagging to use premium powerups is beyond annoying. It's Sudoku, the game is not unique enough to warrant this kind of intentionally focus-breaking monetization. Shame"

65,Elizabeth Rose,"April 7, 2020",4, Endless fun and relaxing
66,John Fitzpatrick,"March 16, 2020",2, 30 seconds to 1 minute long intrusive ads start after level 36 and run every 2 levels after that. Entertaining game otherwise. Don't mind ads as they pay the developers but being unable to stop them for so long is bad

I think it would be far more beneficial if the numbers themselves had bold colors but the areas around the numbers was not colored. The colorless mode is not much easier as the tan background makes the numbers extremely hard to see against it and with no way to highlight numbers without using a powerup the colorless mode simply becomes a confusing sea of numbers. With a few touch ups I think this game will be an excellent and innovative take on the typical sudoku experience."

Now I am uninstalling it for the third time. The levels are unrealistic in the time frame given unless you pay money to get gems to keep going. I kept it installed for the daily quest and hoping that maybe after this level I would get one with a longer time frame. Im not that fast and expecting to beat a level in under 2mins is ridiculous. It takes the joy out of the game. Uninstalling for final time.

Since I downloaded the game over a year ago, I have only gotten 1 star for the daily level. The time frame given seems to be impossible.

But they usually only give you 20-25 seconds at a time for watching a 30 second ad. This means to finish a puzzle you have to spend more time watching ads then actually playing.

89,A Google user,"January 23, 2019",3, wanted to get this app for learning the game as well as to enjoy the storyline. however relaxed version could be offered for beginners like myself. will give this 5 stars if the relaxed version is offered. timed version really gets you frustrated . hope it can be offered soon.
90,Efra M,"March 3, 2019",1," It started out good, but the constant ads that disrupt my audiobook, and shorter timers make this game an absolute pain to play. There's an ad when leaving the level, and again if retrying. And unless you want to pay to play, the time extensions are ridiculous. Uninstalled."
91,Michael LaPlante,"November 21, 2018",4," Ok game. Too many ads. For those that don't know, force close the app when the ads come up and restart the game. A lot faster than waiting 30 seconds for ad to finish."
92,Crystal Phillips,"November 3, 2019",2, Loved this game and played frequently up until 2 months ago when it started not opening. Frustrating
93,sa PaRIaH,"April 8, 2019",4," Hate the time limits but otherwise it's a perfectly fine game for Sudoku with lovely graphics. Side Note: Don't advertise that you'll give free gems if you download another app, if you're not actually going to give the gems!!"
94,A Google user,"March 21, 2019",2, The whole point of sudoku for me is to relax and take it easy. This app puts a timer on each game which ruins the whole relax bit. On top of that it gives you limited lives after which you have to wait hours or pay for more. Again takes away from the main reason I play. No fun.
95,Chelsea Ann,"November 7, 2019",2, The concept is cool but the color coded numbers make it dificult for me to focus on the board
96,Richard Santiago,"July 17, 2019",1," This is suppose to be a game you sit, relax, and think. there's a timer because it's the only way to aggressively incentivise players to spend money, which in my opinion is very distasteful . uninstalled 30 minutes of installing."
97,Jessica H,"August 27, 2019",5," Love this app, but I wish there was some kind of music that played will playing the game. At the main screen there's music but when you start a level there is no music. Which it could just be my phone. Love ur game. thanks for making it free."
98,Ashley Gordon,"October 26, 2018",5," This was one of my favorite apps, but with the update that happened yesterday it won't load. It just crashes every time. Company replied back and fixed the issue!"
99,Jen Lippitt,"October 11, 2018",3," I made a comment before about level 16 being too difficult. Has this been fixed? No, because level 16 is still too difficult. I am very close to uninstalling the game. Please fix this level."
100,tanz gt,"November 19, 2019",5, I really love this sudoku.i have been playing sudoku on this since past 5 years.. I have tried almost all the apps ..so far this is the best with different variations of sudoku..
101,Ann Griffith,"December 5, 2019",5, Fun to play few minutes a day
102,Dayna Glass,"September 30, 2018",4," I like playing Sudoku. The double puzzle levels add to the variety in the game. I wish the creators would provide the player with target times for each star on the regular levels, not just the daily puzzle."
103,A Google user,"November 28, 2018",5," Love sudoku, been playing it for years, this is a new interesting way to play, never played it like some of the levels before, I get bored easily, this isn't boring at all, keeps me busy and makes time go by quick"
104,Pat Iwata,"March 4, 2020",5, lots of variations
105,Cassandra Bates,"November 15, 2018",2, Volume doesn't impact ads. I turn off all volume in app and ads play at full volume - not at all what is required. Playing this before bed means waking up anyone nearby - volume in an app should impact all aspects of the app.
106,Kathleen Radaszkiewicz,"October 22, 2018",3, It's good I like the different types of puzzles but it's hard to follow the numbers especially are the bigger puzzles where there are so many numbers.
107,Marion Essam,"June 7, 2019",5, Great game. Gives lots of different Sudoku not just 9-grid. I like the variety. Numbers are good size. Number-remaining of the selection numbers makes play faster. Ads are low impact and pay-to-play is not required.
108,Linda Michelle Weinberger,"August 23, 2019",4, Challenging and fun! The level map is a little boring and repeats with only a few different designs. Overall an enjoyable game. Keep those updates coming!
109,Christina Taylor,"February 7, 2020",5, Only level 15 but having fun so far
110,L8dynisha J,"September 19, 2018",4," This is a great game! It starts easy and progressively gets more challenging, but not fast, through timed play and larger puzzles."
111,Brandon Heist,"September 18, 2019",4, Love it.. Basic soduko game with a twist. Maybe ita just me but i enjoy having a time limit on some levels... Makes the game more challenging. But i love that theres levels you have to meet in order to move on.. Havent seen a game like this before
112,Heather Sharkey,"July 16, 2019",5, I'm so addicted. I play this game all the time. Never needed to spend a dime to enjoy this game and i love how the difficulty increases but is never so hard ita not fun. Keep up the great work!
113,Lady Spawner,"January 5, 2019",4, Its a decent game. Would of rated higher but no exit button anywhere and the colors of certain numbers are a bit to hard to see numbers in. Wish we could opt for black numbers.
114,Shelley Ellsworth,"November 20, 2018",3, Sudoku is meant to be for relaxation and meditation. This game makes you try to finish a puzzle within a time limit which causes me stress and anxiety. I quess whether you like it or not depends on how competitive you are.
115,Wendy Meyer,"June 3, 2019",2, I love the game within s game aspect. However...I would much rather play without the timer. I'm deleting this game because of that. There should be an option of playing without running out of time.
116,Felicia Robinson17,"May 17, 2019",5, keeps ur mind sharp bc doesnt just 1 type of puzzles it goes bk and forth from easy 2 hard and some r timed and some r unlimited amount of time BUT should b a way 2 get more gems and other items by watching videos instead of ONLY paying for everything!! 2 me only issue ive come across
117,Robin woodley,"October 24, 2018",4," Level 24 seems to have a problem with the joining blocks. There should be six, but there is 8. Impossible to pass"
118,Jitendra Rout,"November 15, 2018",4," I like Sudoku since my college days. Previously I used to play Sudoku in Newspapers, but I am playing in Sudoku Quest app now.

119,Brittany Cannon,"April 25, 2019",5, awesomely addictive game. little to no ads. i absolutely love this game!! also very challenging.
120,Stacey Beard,"September 12, 2018",4, Different than other Suzuki games. But it is fun to play. And the daily puzzles are a challenge. Keeps my mind active
121,Alexis Tingler,"May 23, 2019",5," this game is amazing!!!!!! the levels get progressively harder and it is finally giving me a challenge, thank you so much for making this amazing app!!!"
122,Emily Smith,"July 30, 2019",1, pretty boring.. it awards you coins and gems but nothing to spend them on other than buying additional spins with gems...which makes no sense because you just get more coins to not spend on anything.
123,melanie brazier,"October 14, 2018",3," Sudoku Quest Good game, however some of the levels are quite difficult and it's almost impossible to complete or get three stars in the time given."
124,Elizabeth Romo,"January 4, 2019",5," Fun to play, I especially like the color scheme. It's easier on the eyes when compared to plain old black and white."
125,Christy Jones,"March 29, 2019",5, excellent pass time game if you are a Sudoku lover like I am. Puzzles are easy yet challenging and get harder as you progress through the game.
126,falisha gomez,"February 4, 2019",5, I love this game! I really love that I'm being timed so it really keeps me on my toes! yes! great job developers!
127,sean davidson,"April 7, 2019",5," I really enjoy the progressive difficulty, rather than just one game at a time; like so many other apps."
128,Hailey Zettler,"January 2, 2019",4," it's a great and fun game, but STOP WITH THE TOON BLAST AD! I dont want to play that game and it is annoying that it pops up everytime I end a game."
129,Daniel Foley III,"December 1, 2019",2, I love it but keeps on stalling in the middle of the game
130,Pamela Barrett,"May 29, 2019",3," I've been enjoying the game, but i finished level 126 and the rest of the levels are closed off. There is no explanation on how to unlock them. So, i guess I'm done."
131,Julie Pohl,"October 26, 2019",1, This game doesnt even follow the basic rules. There are repeats of the same numbers in the same line! How am i suppose to solve this puzzle when there are two of the same numbers in the line? Stupid...
132,Tammy Dietz,"November 12, 2018",4, A little bit wonky with the different colors but overall I like it. More fun than just a plain Jane sudoku game.
133,A Google user,"January 21, 2019",2, good things first: the game has nice controls. that's it. bright colors are distracting af and why are there power ups in sudoku..
134,Isamar Acevedo,"May 5, 2019",5, absolutely love it! love gow it keeps challenging me and wanting me to go to the next stage. super fun.
135,Bernardo Vergara,"June 13, 2019",5, all bug fix and its exciting to play now knowing that i can save my progress with my google account i was on level 199 but dont have a facebook so when my phone broke all the progress was loss...working on reaching my rightful level
136,Steven Schenck,"May 10, 2019",3, Like the game but hated the fact you cant turn off timer. I play for fun and do not like the stress of the timer.
137,Ingrid L,"May 25, 2019",2, Fun game. Removed because it gets frustrating when you hit to use pencil and it doesn't engage and you then have to hit 2 more buttons wasting Precious time. Ads after every game
138,Charlene C,"September 18, 2018",3," I played 20 games. I expected they would get progressively more difficult, but they didn't. The puzzles are far too easy making this a boring game."
139,Ana Cecilia,"June 19, 2019",3, just started so far i really like it. its pretty challenging for me. its good you can take the option of having no color on the game.
140,Michelle Skolly,"August 17, 2019",5, I've been playing this on and off for months and it keeps me engaged. It's not fancy but it has a good solid easy to use interface.
141,Rainbow Diamond,"December 13, 2018",5, I like this different twist on a classic game. I'm looking forward to the harder levels. Very fun game and worth the download.
142,J. Gorgs,"April 8, 2019",2, Should have added a setting where you can change the display of the puzzles. Too much colors can be an eyesore TBH Edit: Thanks for the response
143,Ronnie Cox,"April 28, 2019",5, love the different styles of challenges. Love the way this game makes you think hard n fast. Love the game.
144,Jason Broadbent,"November 7, 2018",5, Good game. Not too challenging to begin with. Ideal for beginners and not too slow building for pros.
145,1LAKERSGIRL,"December 15, 2018",5," I just learned how to play sudoku. It's not nearly as hard as I have been fooling myself to believe. I love the challenges now, they keep my mind sharp. I recommend this game to people with patience and fast eyes. Have fun, I AM."
146,Jacklynn Cunningham,"January 28, 2019",5," i just started playing, but i can tell you that coming from someone who loves sudokus but sucks at them, this is the perfect game for beginners because they gradually get harder."
147,Brooke Jackman,"October 30, 2018",5," Its variations of sudoku, I think it's cool and interesting and the changing format keeps it fresh and interesting."
148,S. Kita,"March 7, 2019",4," feel left out. I do NOT have social media. period.

UPDATE RESPONSE TO YOUR RESPONSE, DEVELOPER: Once again: I do NOT have facebook account. I am sure I am not the only one. Why ONLY the facebook connections getting gifts? maybe read the comment before you answer. what you said is clear in your gameplay. I did not get an answer whatsoever."
149,Jacob Smith,"December 4, 2018",2, there is a glitch that if you start the game from a game notification that the game will never load. It stays on the hashcube splash green forever and the game never finishes loading
150,Marla Reed,"January 20, 2019",5, A lot of fun. Challenging. sometimes not enough time given but still good game
151,Serena Bell,"November 19, 2018",4, Enjoy the increase of difficulty each new level. This game would also be a good way to learn how to solve sudoku puzzles.
152,Courtney Clark,"July 25, 2019",2," not challenging at all. no ""quest"" twist to be found in this game. became redundant very quickly. though, graphics were very vibrant."
153,Rachael Snider,"February 10, 2019",2, was good. but now the controls all changed and it locks onto a number and became more of a pita. wants to put that same number in every square. IT WONT TURN THAT OPTION OFF
154,Heather LaCarte,"April 18, 2019",5, Love this type of Sudoka. Gives the player more of an adventure in solving the puzzles.
155,Sherin Tan,"October 25, 2018",1," Used to play it daily and loved it before the 24 Oct update. But since updated the game, it will always crash when I try to open.. Pls fix it!"
156,Mother MayI,"April 23, 2019",5, Some levels are quite a challenge. The timer adds a heightened level of excitement!
157,Shelby Inman,"September 22, 2019",1, Unsolvable puzzle. There is a spot on a puzzle that HAS to be both a 4 and a 5 and obviously it can't be both. I have a screenshot.
158,Jo Clark,"June 12, 2019",3, it's fun but frustrating because there are no instructions and I keep winning coins that do not appear to have any use.
159,Julie Lawrence,"September 15, 2019",1, Unable to see the available numbers at the bottom of the screen. When puzzle was finished app did nothing to continue to another puzzle
160,Karinn Martel,"May 20, 2019",3, I hate timed games. I'd much rather not be stressed. If you gave the option of turning the timer off then you would have a perfect game.
161,Melissa Prosser,"September 23, 2018",5, Simple yet fun twist on sudoku. Progression is good and gives you something to aim to achieve while playing.
162,175maddie,"June 23, 2019",3," I love this game, but I'm not able to connect my Facebook to it. Is that from a glitch? Please fix it so I can go back to playing."

168,Rhonda Kay Wallace,"November 23, 2018",5, sometimes the puzzles could give alittle more time or when finishing a puzzle fast could win more time on bigger puzzles love the game anyway
169,Nick Lawrence,"November 12, 2018",1, There are to many ads that you are forced to watch completely ruins the game.
170,Diane Mitchell,"March 8, 2019",5," First off, thank you to the developers for getting back to me that helps alot, Thank you! this game is awesome ^--^, I love the puzzles and the random challenges, thank you for the game :)"

172,Niki C,"March 21, 2019",1," Instead of 9 numbers in a row, this has 4, so if you're looking to play soduko, this is not for you... unless you're a 5 year old."
173,Pepper Hall,"August 25, 2019",5, From easy to really really tough puzzles accomplished through a progressively larger and larger grid area makes learning Sudoku so easy.

190,Lamar Douglas,"September 17, 2018",5, Fun game. Looking forward to when I get to the challenging levels
191,Carol Behrens,"January 8, 2020",1, Very disappointing. You have to play with the game wants you to play. You don't have any choice about the type of game or the difficulty.
192,Dave Malone,"January 23, 2019",1," ""Daily Spin"" is rigged & timed puzzles after a point are impossible, so this game is a naked money grab & a sham."

After having played this game a long time (I'm on 504), the time limit on the puzzles are so short they're really just more frustrating than add onto the challenge of the game like I had felt before. Also, with the ads that are now required every time you start a game, this game is just no longer fun. The daily sudoku puzzle is still great but that's just because there isn't a time limit. Unfortunately, the daily sudoku isn't enough to keep me."

1145,Tristina Blue,"August 3, 2018",3," The puzzles were easy but the graphics make it difficult to focus. Too many 
different colors and you arent able to change it to an easier color scheme. 
And the puzzles that mix multiple sudokus into one big one need better 
barrier lines as well."
1146,Ravinder Kaur Sidhu,"August 17, 2018",2," The barriers between the puzzles are hard to define. The puzzles aren't 
very difficult but the graphics, colours and lack of clear lines does make

select the number each time, pretty annoying after awhile."

being timed. I am often called away, and I prefer these puzzles to be a

Captivating as Alice leads you, the foreshadowed Savior through the various temples of the hybridized map of Nahuatl and Egypt, perhaps even with her wardrobe Rome. A quest it is indeed, with various different play types including thus far overlapping suduko puzzles. I look forward to finding out more about this game as the saga ensues. Made it a few paces past Chief Coco, a tiki rocking lord that bestows his champions with emerald orbs, for suduko oracle purposes. Enter, Explore, Expand, Expedite, and be Entertained. Major thanks to the developers at Hashcube Studios."

1788,Angela Marshall,"July 21, 2017",3, Game itself is great. My issue is not being able to change the design of the boards. The squares are awkward and all the million rainbow colors are seriously confusing to anyone with even the smallest amount of eye issues. Even wearing my glasses the colors just look like a jumbled mess!

1791,Monique Dalton,"August 10, 2017",4, Great game. Time frames are a bit unrealistic especially for the daily. May I suggest putting in an erase tile button. It gets a bit frustrating having to undo 20 moves just to fix two tiles. Other than that it's great. Edit to add.. the quick pick feature isn't working.
1792,Noor Azrin,"September 11, 2017",3, Performance is quite bad. I can't input numbers when the game started but the clock continues ticking. Have to wait almost 2 minutes before i can really start playing. No chance of winning üòû. Stuck at level 147

I'm in the lower 400's in levels. It starts out simple and quite addicting until you move up. The Sudokus repeat but you get less time. A 9x9 that used to give you 12mins at first has only about 3mins in the 400's. They used to have ads you can watch for gems. They got rid of it and started daily Sudoku. At first you could get 1 gem even if you don't make it in time, now they give you lousy 1000 coins you can earn for replaying the first sudokus. They must be in need for money; trying to push you to buy gems. When you get up there in levels you need gems to extend your time. It's ridiculous! I lost my motivation for this game and will likely switch to something else or go back to the books."

I wish it had a colour scheme option. Also the daily challenge is coded wrong. You should be able to do a daily challenge should anytime of the day. This app only allows you to do it every 24 hours."
2157,Vanessa Alicea,"May 21, 2017",4," Love it, I can definitely do without the push notifications though. I don't need to be reminded to play. I'm a mother 2 and don't always have time and u exist very important phone calls and texts all day I don't need game notifications as well thank you!"
2158,Sara Romans,"May 31, 2017",3," I can beat the levels just fine on the PC version, but I can't play on my phone. The timer seems to be either faster or doesn't give as much time as the PC version. I'm not a super genius, and I can be a little slow, but even at a quick pace, I don't have enough time to solve."
2159,Aiyanna Jacobson,"May 12, 2017",4, Fun game my only complaint is the number selector is too close to the phones menu buttons. Constantly hitting the menu button and it gets annoying. If numbers were bigger or placed further away that would hekp. Otherwise fun game
2160,Linda Brown,"April 7, 2017",1, Before the recent upgrade I liked the game. But after the upgrade it is slmost impossible to finish a puzzle before the time runs out and it asks you to pay for more time.
2161,Les Dionisio,"March 6, 2017",5, This game taught me how to play Sudoku. Doesnt teach terminology of the game but helps develop a mindset to win the game.  Wish there was a non-timer mode to play the game at a relaxing pace.
2162,Heather Nommensen,"April 30, 2017",5," Best sudoku app I've seen yet. I like that they change it up with the different boxes and numbers. Graphics are great too, it's not plain. Great job developers."
2163,Victoria Cummins,"February 26, 2017",5, Great way to pass the time!!! The last couple of puzzles have a ridiculously short amount of time making it almost impossible to beat the entire game but I have restarted over and over!!!!
2164,Gwen W Carroll,"June 20, 2017",4, Play is great till you get up into the 50's and you keep losing gems because the last # you hit is under extra time and gems are gone.

Other than that, I love this version of sudoku so far. Very interesting & not at all boring like plain 9 square setups."
2274,Michele Torres,"February 15, 2017",3," I do really like the game, but I HATE getting notifications AFTER I have selected to not receive notifications via the app itself and also going through the settings on my phone.

It removes the challenge by removing used numbers. Also I don't like that we can no longer pencil in an invalid cell. Again removes the challenge.

The whole adventure path is a bit lacking but overall makes me want to keep going just to see whats going on with it.

Awesome job guys."

Even when the puzzles themselves are no more difficult than ones before, the time limits make you work harder to pass the levels. They have good clues and helps along the way if you get stuck and you can buy more time, but I think the fun of it is in the challenge. When I can't solve it in time, I like to just redo the level until I pass. This way I am pushing myself to get better and the accomplishment is sweeter."

Over all I feel like I'm just playing the same difficulty of puzzles as I started with, after days of playing the game. Anthro problem for the programmers is, if you scroll up a good distance and then quickly scroll back down, it does not render everything. Hope improvements are made."

2550,Keena Hudson,"July 4, 2016",1,Tried to charge my daughter $150 Thankfully she doesn't know my password otherwise I would be $150 poorer. Update after developer's comment.

2551,Deepika Anand,"July 3, 2016",3,It's addictive..But consumes more battery power This s so addictive that I completed level100 in 4 or 5 days.. But turns me off that it uses more battery power.. I wanted to play this all day but it gives low battery soon.. P.s. only when I play this game..

So far the game is extreme simplistic. 30 puzzles in andi have yet to get a puzzle that requires me to pause for even a second to think. The only time I've struggled was when it forced me to use the power up that says which square you should fill in next. For about 10 seconds I tried to figure out what went in that cell before I just gave up and solve it. The last square I ended up filling in was the power ups suggesti
2605,Anna C,"June 20, 2016",5,Pretty awesome... Prettie easy but gives yew a little bit of a test every once in a while. I like it. Makes me feel smarter but the story line thing is kinda dumb. It really has no use..
2606,Lori V,"June 26, 2016",3," Really like most of it. No waiting for lives, watch a video for extra time, challenging but not too difficult. Only negative is sometimes after watching said video for more time, it resets the whole puzzle. #Frustratingasallgetout"

However, I'm not sure what the point of steadily decreasing the brightness of the screen is, it's distracting and irritating.

3096,NaKesha Artis,"May 8, 2016",3,"Fun with ads The game is easy to learn, step-by-step instuctions are given and quests are clear. I do not like having to deal with ""rate us"" every five to six puzzles. I also have a great distaste for ads before every level. If there weren't so many ads my review would be better.

3099,Phillip Wallace,"May 15, 2016",3,Needs great improvment First off every time you turn around its jamming ads down your throat. Games this desperate don't want to be played furthermore during the puzzles the screen darkens so need to keep the screen active or have an option to do so.
3100,Cathi Lang,"May 14, 2016",3,"Sudoku Quest I love the concept of the quest. I can't stand the pop up after every level to try a new game. If I want a new game, I will search for one. I did not download Google play services because I do not care to play with the world, just myself, otherwise I would have chosen a multi-player game."
3101,Anne Roberts,"May 13, 2016",2,glitch? I really enjoy the games but I am missing the competitive part.

I hate the fact that they skew the timer heavily in their favor; on certain levels. The higher the level the more notes you have to make and their notes are manual, no auto removal. You have to click twice for an add or an erase in each box. All precious time that is counting down, yet all necessary actions on the hardest of difficulties. You have to find those hidden pairs, etc and decipher the puzzle and that takes complete notes on some of these puzzles."

It is easier to input numbers, especially when doing notes. I won't be playing anymore, unless number painting is added as an option. Once added you will get five stars from me."
3303,V√§in√∂ Lepp√§nen,"May 1, 2016",2,High quality basics Professionally developed Sudoku with different kind of boards as the game moves along. No problems per se but the game kept bugging me with notifications about my lack of playing so I uninstalled it. There's probably another Sudoku that lets me play when I want to and otherwise leaves me alone.
3304,Martin Vellacott,"April 26, 2016",4,"Fun Enjoyable varieties of Sudoku, not taxing so an easy way to pass a few minutes. The ads aren't intrusive but I find the attempts to connects me to Facebook infuriating. Why not one question at the start which you can change in the options."
3305,Shawn Eicher,"April 30, 2016",1,"Good game, annoying self promotion I hate any game that persistently reminds me to rate the game and have decided that no matter how good the game i will rate with a single star. If i like the game enough i will rate it for others in my good time."
3306,Katherine Robinson,"April 16, 2016",5,Addicting and Glitch-free The appearance of the ads is predictable and organized and never causes the game to freeze. Hardly ever an X rated ad. The game has fair and challenging parameters and time limits. Progressive difficulty keeps you hooked. I'm enjoying this game very much.
3307,Elea Sutter,"April 29, 2016",2,"I love the game play Love the game play, but when the timer runs out and it gives me the option to add time if I watch an ad, it's REALLY infuriating that at least half the time it says I failed after I've watched the ad. I've been down to 3 numbers to enter, it's just about clicking, and I have to restart the level."
3308,Laura Thompson,"April 27, 2016",4,Fun This is the best Suduko that I've found online! Sometimes it's a fight to get the numbers to go in but that could just be my new phone. If you love Sudoku this is a must!
3309,Merrissa Engstrom,"April 25, 2016",4,Fun! It's fun and addicting! Just wish there was a way to reset the board when you mess up instead of having to back out of if completely....only complaint though!

It was already difficult to play on a large tablet due to the lack of landscape mode and small buttons, but it's now impossible for me to meet the time limit.

Please greatly reduce the number of times it does this.

The only thing they can do apart from creating new map is just shortening the time in completing the puzzle. No creativity on the recent update at all!
