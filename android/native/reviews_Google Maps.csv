You can imagine how frustrating that is in the middle of needing it. Says searching for GPS sometimes, but I had perfect reception, in populated areas. Rebooted during my nav, worked for a few, and did the same thing again! This has become a piece of junk for me, and I will need to switch to Waze out of desperation!"

This app has never let me down until today. While driving maps froze. I tried several times to restart it after the ""maps is temporarily unavailable please try again in a few minutes"" and pressing the try again option didn't work. Leaving me lost, in the dark, late at night with my child in the back seat."

If your destination is on the upper left of the map and you are driving, you have to use your finger and move the map, which is not legal in California. The bottom of the screen is now just black. ****Update**** It just got worse. It has a SECOND green box cover the map while you are trying to look at the streets. Time to find a new map app"

I only ever used to use the Maps app but it's has recently been so buggy. The most common issue is when you're driving on the freeway. It will think that you exited and reroute you to get back on the freeway when you're still there drivng past the exit. This isn't a problem that occurs every now and then. It's constant. Never had these issues before. Perhaps it was in one of the updates. Please fix it, Google!"

Really annoying having to drop a pin to multiple people for events and such and having goods/services delivered that cant find the house.

139,Midnight Son,"April 25, 2020",1," why have you removed timeline, settings and compass, also, during navigation when another route shows up you cannot even switch routes, tapping on the new route used to show you the distance and you could decide if you want to take it or not, but that's gone too... useless!!"

213,Alex Tsidulko,"April 18, 2020",1," Something happened with one of the past updates. App is constantly crushing. Sometimes I get a message ""maps keeps stopping"" even when I didn't open the app. That's annoying. Can't use it anymore"
214,Ray c,"April 25, 2020",1," Google maps stopped working, they broke it to force you to update. The update ruined the functionality of the app and greatly increased its data usage and data recording.

215,King smith,"April 30, 2020",1," No longer works since recent update... Click to open the app and after a few seconds it closes itself 👎🏻. Update, tried clearing the cache and uninstalling updates and still the same issue once it updates itself again (works fine with old version)"
216,Steve Riker,"April 24, 2020",1," Constantly loses connection. With each trip, I lose connection and miss turns all the time. I rely on Maps to perform technical service calls and the loss of connection is costing me precious time and money. The Wayz app never loses connection."

219,J M Forest,"April 17, 2020",2, Not happy with the app. I keep losing the talking directions and having to keep deleting and reinstalling the app. But every update removes the speech directions so it's useless to use. perhaps i should use a different map app

I wondered why the hamburger icon on the upper left had been replaced with the silly-looking tabular bars on the buttom where some options doesn't have any practical functions - such as an easy access to Google Earth.

Not get directions, just be able to see bike routes on the map. However, while using it offline, the bike routes (dark green lines) will randomly disappear. If I go to layers and click ""Bicycling,"" I get a message saying ""Bicycling is not available offline."" However, if I keep clicking it, eventually the lines will appear again (and last for a while before they disappear again). This is very annoying. If it helps, I am running Android 9 on a Sony Xperia XZ1 compact, if that helps. That said, my favorite thing about this app is Google's map tiles, which I find much easier to read and interpret than most other street maps. Also I very much like that it shows not just bike paths but also local designated bike routes and lanes, which all the other mapping apps I've looked at are missing.

I noticed a few weeks ago everytime I would use the app, it would freeze causing me to miss my turn or drive past my destination. At first I thought it was my phone (Note 8) as it has been acting up but then when I got my replacement phone, I noticed the same issues which eliminates the possibility that it was the phone(s) not working properly. There is something wrong with this app that causes it to constantly freeze on the Samsung Note 8 phone."

I like it, because I forget to look before I start driving and need to write down the mileage at the end of the trip. The part I don't like about the app is the selection of routes it gives you. In addition, the first recommended route is just not the best option many times. The streets it selects for you to dive down, and things like that could be improved. Maybe it should watch which streets most people use and pick better to drive streets. Many times it does not give directions that go directly to the freeway. It gives directions that takes too long to get to the freeway, after having to drive too long on streets with stoplights and slow drivers in front of you. I try to use Mapquest often to get better routes."

I've liked the newer features that's been added over the past year and I even thought the little Google car was a cute icon to use during the birthday celebration. But now whenever I need it for active navigation it says my GPS signal is lost but everything is connected, location is on, and data is turned on. Even closing out the app and restarting my directions does absolutely nothing. What happened?"

Removal of hamburger menu is a disappointment but it was hard to reach of right hand folks. Now it's in the top right and it makes it hard to reach for left hand folks. Also, the increasing screen size isn't helping. Instead my advice is to keep it in the bottom bar Menu instead of the commute option. I personally barely use it since i don't have a fixed schedule to decide where to travel to"

I have tried a different GPS map app and it works correctly which shows it is not a hardware issue.

I put a destination in and when Google maps tells me to leave I end up missing my transportation or I get sent down the wrong route constantly. Google maps sucks on a unfathomable level. Google is completely useless for anything other than mindless entertainment and useless wikipedia facts

I'll out in a search for a business and I'll get options but when I click on one of the red pins for a business it'll either pull it up like normal or throw me way off the currently viewed area into nowhere. Locks up randomly as well....Just my experience, other peoples could be different. Using a Google pixel 3 XL."

1292,Gloria Carmona,"February 9, 2020",2," Had been using google maps for 11 years straight, with no problems at all! I just loved it! I am not able to go places without it.

1293,SABRINA Garrison,"February 16, 2020",1, Since the update it doesnt work. It shows I am no where near where I am. When I start navigation it does not move from where it starts me from. I can no longer use it other than to write down directions for where I'm going. Bad update. Multiple problems that need to be fixed.

I find myself typing too much and reinputting the password multiple times per day. It now opens a browser of which all of the above is required and then states that it can't use the Google Maps app and that I need to use google go or the secondary app whose purpose is solely for phones who don't have storage. I have 256GB on this phone so that is not the problem. Short and sweet I hate the new update and Google maps is really difficult to use.

1542,Tony Shum,"February 18, 2020",2, Not sure if this is maps or Android auto app issue. It was working fine until my OnePlus 6t updated to Android 10. Now Android auto does not respond after few minutes. I have to re-plug my phone in order to get Android auto to respond again. I think one of these 2 apps is not Android 10 compliance.

1565,C,"March 7, 2020",2, Super slow to load. Navigation is good and finding places works great but it's annoyingly slow. If you select something or search it takes a while so you don't know if it's lag or just not working. The maps are the best though.

Over all the benefits and features out ways the minor downside, we do need offline mode"
1698,BaBaJi,"March 25, 2020",5," Everything is fine. Besides navigation It is also very helpful while studying geography.There should be also proper boundaries between different districts in a state. More features like political map of world , physical map would also be very helpful if could be added.😊😊😊"

1702,Bria Armstrong,"April 5, 2020",1, For some reason i can't use this app anymore. It keeps dropping location. It will start then before i even move it says location lost. I never had that problem before so i don't understand.
1703,John McDonald,"March 31, 2020",1, Had to remove it following the removal of the hamburger. How typical of Google to 'fix' something that isn't broken.

1704,Va Le Ah,"March 28, 2020",1," This latest version directs you to turn left/right without stating the exact STREET to turn. I've missed turns and even ran a red light looking for where to turn. As a courier, that's extremely distracting and dangerous. Not happy at all. Back to Waze..."

1714,Anne Hesse,"April 8, 2020",1," This usually rates 5 stars but lately Maps has been off-kilter. Wrong directions, confused between left or right, won't reset, perhaps gps is off too. I can't depend on it anymore. It won't let me update."

1720,Fernando Lara,"February 10, 2020",1," It stopped working after the latest update. Whenever I put an address in maps it pulls it up, but when I start driving the vehicle marker on the screen stays at the same place, it doesn't move as I drive. It's very annoying."
1721,Elsz,"March 14, 2020",1, Still bad location tracking. Even worse than before. Last 2 or 3 updates and maps doesn't know where I am for at least 5 minutes of me driving.

1722,Robbie Raaf,"February 10, 2020",3," Could be more accurate and easier to use. It could update when streets are closed or there's road work. Why why why would they change the logo? Everyone's used to clicking the icon, now it's different and we need to search for it."

I use it for mapping everyday.
1727,Amy,"February 6, 2020",1, Its really great for directions but it Keeps saving my search history. All of my settings are set to off. I am not happy that my choices are being violated by google. The new logo is hideous its needs to go back to the old one
1728,james anderson,"February 11, 2020",2, Why does it only go back to a few places in my history when I'm putting in the destination? It used toi go back weeks even months back. I needed that feature because I'm a service technician and I have to return to the same addresses quite often.

1730,Jordan Dixon,"February 14, 2020",1," Awful update. For some reason the update rolled back my settings to previous years favorites.

1786,Glen Mendez,"February 10, 2020",5," Just love the new version of maps. The font on Android auto looks a lot rounded and smooth. Best if all, it now shows the speed limit on the roads. Best update ever. It's now the most complete navigation software you ever need. Thanks Google"
1787,Cindy Koval,"February 19, 2020",2," Maps is the only app i use for turn by turn navigation. Since the update though, i constantly lose gps. I hope they put out an update that fixes it. Right now, i wouldn't be comfortable using it in an unfamiliar area."
1788,Raymond Ortiz,"March 29, 2020",1, My Maps app no longer tracks my movements during travel. It knows where I am when I begin a trip but then it just stays there as I move. I've seen others are experiencing this but no one has come up with a solution yet.
1789,Mark Pingitore,"March 29, 2020",1," Please help me understand why I am now having so many glitching and ""GPS not found"" issues in the past few weeks. I've cleared the cache in my Maps app settings on my Samsung S7 which alleviates the issues for a short time but the issues then reappear."

1791,MJ,"March 4, 2020",1," As others are saying, for about a week now the app just freezes in place when I try to drive somewhere using it. Very dangerous if you're traveling to a new location using a highway. Will not be using this app anymore if they don't fix this"

1794,Rainbow Medicinal and other Plants Nursery,"February 18, 2020",1," Very bad experience with this app, in the begining it shows the right way but while driving it starts to show the wrong way. When you are going towards your destination suddenly it starts to say you to take u turn. It usually happens every time whenever I use this app."
1795,Daniel Marston,"February 24, 2020",2, The new update sucks. What happened to showing the time remaining in the trip and the miles in the bottom of the screen. Also when you clicked on that before it brought up details you can choose from. You need to bring back those options

1803,Sindre Johansen,"February 20, 2020",5, The most powerful tool you can own on your phone. GPS works flawlessly. A Yellow Pages for all business with all the info u need. It is also the most intrusive app you can have. Monitors your moves every second.
1804,Danielle Moorman,"February 21, 2020",1, Ever since the update I have had constant problems with 'searching for GPS' - doesn't matter where I am or how much service I have. Almost every drive there are problems with finding a GPS signal making the app effectively useless.

1807,Jackson Guan,"March 2, 2020",1," Borderline useless. Since the new update, maps constantly drops your location when you try to navigate. I have to exit my navigation and start a new once just for the app to find my location again. Edit: they sent me a link on how to use location for Maps. Not helpful."
1808,bholu pandit,"March 15, 2020",1, Earlier the app was very much accurate and reliable but since last few weeks it does not work. While navigating there a fixed blue dot instead of an arrow. The location in app does not update with the actual location change. It is of no use in it's current form.
1809,Abdelrhman Ashraf,"March 20, 2020",5, It's a very good app I used it every day I hope if you can add something to the to be a perfect app that thing is ( allow to follow someone on the map by sharing a live locarion to someone for following ) that thing will be a great thing At the end i hope i can explain that matter good Thank you
1810,Franky G,"March 19, 2020",1," This app sucks. It cannot refresh my current position on time. What is more hilarious, every time after I report this problem the blue dot becomes normal, which indicate that you can solve this problem easily but you generated them deliberately."

1817,Eric Moss,"February 8, 2020",1," The new update makes it nearly impossible to discover parks by scrolling around the basic map view. Everything is colored green now opposed to just parks being green. Why was this change made, it doesn't seem logical at all?"

1826,Jason Poole,"April 23, 2020",3, Maps are utterly broken now. Most roads are only shown as one way and nearly always facing the wrong direction Has the network been hacked or is victim of a 4chan op?

I have an observation specially in India. When you Navigate to a place . . You pass by many small cities and towns. While passing through those small cities / towns it navigates through dense city centers or through crowded market places (with very small road width) which becomes very difficult to drive and also take more time to travel. Instead if Google can provide an option to select Avoid City centers and Market places (in this case itshould automatically select outer ring roads) . . This would help to go via outer ring roads (with some extra kms) but would save lot of time and hectic city driving !!! Hope Google will take actions on the same and feedback to us.

2499,marc chinama,"March 13, 2020",1," Google maps use to be my favorite. Now it's not good. I cleared cache, uninstalled and still nothing. A 1.5 hour drive, Google maps says 6 hours. I had to download wave. I hate wave, but Google maps let me down."
2500,Israel Snell,"March 13, 2020",1," I recommend wayz, this app is slow and the highlighted route disappears as soon as you apply any updates. Google should find a better way to gather the information they sell!"

2508,Khemchand Chandwani,"February 26, 2020",3," Before updating app, map was showing route from my location to destination. Now it doesn't show except two above icons. Can't understand whether the travelling route is correct. Plz add the blue coloured path/way on map between two places."

2517,Jacob Mason,"April 11, 2020",1," great if you forgot where you were every minute of the last year. Too much data, turn off location tracking. take a moment out of your freaking life and read a paper map for Christ sakes. This location data will come back to bite you in the ass."

3035,Richard Norris,"March 12, 2020",4," Pretty much the best way to navigate, the only suggestion I can make is making an option to externally share your estimated time of arrival."
3036,Mohammad Ashikuzzaman,"March 8, 2020",1," Last update is just a great mess. When I'm trying to navigate through options located top left corner, it's showing just some annoying info messages."
3037,bianca t,"March 19, 2020",2, GPS barely works anymore and all my routes say they're going to take twice the time they do! Just mapped a drive I know is 2 hours on Google and it said 4.5 hours while Waze was correct.
3038,Gorthalon,"March 3, 2020",1," App is unstable due the the last update, Maps loses GPS signal constantly for no reason. I would not recommend using this app in it's current state."

3047,Musi Nde,"February 19, 2020",2, App has become incredibly slow on my Pixel 3XL and I've had to resort to using other mapping apps. The app is also somehow always offline when all my other apps are using WiFi and data just fine
3048,Richard Sims,"February 25, 2020",2, I'm not happy with the new look. I now have extra steps just to get directions. It's not just Google. Do the people who add extra steps actually go outside and interact with the real world? Or just add extra steps to justify their existence.
