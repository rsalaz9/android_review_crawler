However, I can't swipe it away, just moves it across my screen. There is instructions to make it disappear in the settings but you have to go back in and change it everytime you want to use it or get rid of this eyesore. This worked fine in the background before, why change it to something like a child that demands your attention? This annoying little button shows up in screenshots too!"

The previous version was a great change to the app, but by changing it again as I said it is terrible.

2,Michael Hope,"April 29, 2020",4, Works well when you have wifi. Offline mode is pretty good. I like to use it when I go shopping. It keeps me from buying the wrong things.

I maybe wrong about this but I was without wifi while shopping and I could not use Spanish to English do anything. Surely some words can be saved in the sd card to be used offline??? At least that was how it used to work. Did it change after an update? I am no longer so happy.
3,Rex Samuel Mateo,"April 28, 2020",4, Its almost the perfect translation app but the problem is that sometimes it doesn't detect other text that I'm trying to translate (eg. images) that it ends up being grammatically incorrect in terms of sentence or sometimes it sees the text but with a different interpretation on the text characters ...Full ReviewIts almost the perfect translation app but the problem is that sometimes it doesn't detect other text that I'm trying to translate (eg. images) that it ends up being grammatically incorrect in terms of sentence or sometimes it sees the text but with a different interpretation on the text characters especially the draw pattern (eg. chinese texts). I'm trying to do a scanlation on a manga rn (for my own will ofc lol) and these errors really bothers me. I hope you can do something about this
4,Eric Xu,"April 14, 2020",4," Edit: 3 stars was a bit harsh considering the core functions of the app work.

First of all, double tap or hold has always meant to select a word, why make it difficult and select the entire text when there's already an 'x' button for that? Also, when you select the textbox, it turns into a single line, like what if you wanted to edit a bigger amount of text or see a bit more? Finally, the voice input likes to cut off the end of your sentences."

What a terrible use of space from the app. At the same time, there is literally half of the screen unused by the app while you're typing. If you're typing anymore than a short sentence, it's cumbersome."

The floating icon interferes with the ability to access other apps & tools, forcing me to move it constantly around the screen to get it out of the way. I have accidentally tapped it countless times in an effort to get it out of the way. This is a bug, pure and simple, not an update. Do NOT refer me to a forum post; fix it!"

Updated to android 10 and now I need to have the floating icon to have instant translation. Fix this please.* Good application for online use. The offline features are very hit and miss. I like the 'tap to translate' feature but I don't like a recent update that means when turned on it's always in the notification bar at the top of the phone! Hope this is removed in a future update.

Now you're stuck with either having the floating icon on screen constantly, which interferes with your ability to work in other apps (having to move it out of the way or accidentally tapping on it when you're trying to do something else), or having to repeatedly turn it off and on, either of which is a huge, pointless nuisance. The way it worked before, just popping up when you copied text, was vastly superior."

However there is something which is missing for me and probably a lot other people who are hard of hearing. It would have been very helpful for me if the app had IPA transcription so people who cannot hear properly but could still speak to be able to read how words are correctly to be pronunciated. Life is easy for people without disabilities but the others needs extra consideration.... Please make it easier for everyone!

Please put it back to original functionality which only showed the bubble when copying text. The bubble is extremely annoying and prevents proper use of the phone when not needing to translate.

Why not just solve the problem?

It seems that the performance of this app has deteriorated instead of getting better with updates. The app does not recognize simple words in the context they are meant. For example names. I said my brothers name (Jim)but the app translated it as the word (gym) in the sentence. There are other speech recognition issues as well that need fixing.

At least respect system font size settings and don't make every state change cause the layout to change. The developer response to this is another example of the team working on this app making users do too much work. How hard is it to communicate within your team about the problems users are having with the app rather than making me waste my time finding some other form to fill out just to tell you that I'm unsatisfied?"

1305,Lang Cashman,"February 17, 2020",1," Since an update in late 2019, voice translate always stops listening a few words short. This is extremely frustrating, especially for people who usually use voice translate like me. Renders the app virtually useless."

Now I have to physically open up the app in order to translate something I copied after upgraded to Android 10. Because when enable Tap To Translate, the floating bubble keep showing over any Apps and won't disappear. It is very very annoying. But if I hide the floating bubble, it's just hide forever. Although I can enable the floating bubble back via Tap To Translate notification, but it is a persistent notification which is very mess up my notification. So before you guys do whatever you should do, all I want is to copy text and then the floating bubble show up, a few seconds please disappear like the old ways did. It used to be a perfect apps. NOW it is a very very annoying app. SO DISAPPOINTED, REALLY. I would consider to move to iOS, at least I feel more comfortable for app quality. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Updates]: After a few days around for above app behavior in Android 10, I'd like to say that I just need to get used to it. Here I share a slightly comfortable way to others that you can MINIMIZED the notification of Tap To Translate so that it won't show up on your notification bar. So when you want to use Tap To Translate you could just click SHOW FLOATING ICON from the notification panel. This is the only way I found the most so called convenient so far before the old perfect way come back or I move to iOS."

The tap to translate button used to auto-hide and pop up only when I would copy and paste text. Now, in order to use it the button is visible 100% of the time; even if there is no intent to use it. Nobody needs that stupid button in the way when not in use. It should be invisible until prompted with a copy/paste action like it used to be. At this point I've turned it off.

I found the it translated my Afrikaans (2nd language) to English (1st language) quite well. But it kept typing the incorrect thing in English when I spoke English so naturally the translation came out incorrect. My English is really good not sure if it was my accent. Maybe they can add a learn function so it can work better with different English accents.

In my experience, I believe this to most often be due to the different grammatical structuring of languages and this App's inability to translate correctly because of it. Therefore, often the wrong words are given as a translation, giving a completely different meaning to the original script or, poor phrasing is a result. Camera option is good."

4228,T Schaefer,"December 1, 2019",2, Since the latest revision Google Translate has been cutting off the last couple words in just about every sentence I speak.

I have no Portuguese but with it i could talk to people and get the help i needed when my wife was sick. Fabulous.

In th...Full ReviewGoogle Translate has been my trusty translator app that has helped me out in many a situation. It has been extraordinarily useful to me living in a foreign country, until now. I recently switched from iPhone to Android and I find the app to be unusable now. Bear with me while I try to explain. In the main part of the app up top, you have Google Translate written in the top bar, with the drop down me u box to the left. Underneath this, you have another bar with the Language from and Language to, with arrows between them that allow you to quickly switch the places of the two languages. Then under this, you have the area where you can enter the text you want to translate. However, as soon as you tap the text box, everything shifts upward, so that the first and second bar have now disappeared (this is especially annoying when you forget to press the arrows to switch the languages around before pasting in language to be translated from that is set as language to be translated to. There seems to be no way to access the arrows to switch the language positions - this was never a problem in iPhone). All you have is a single solitary bar to enter text at the extreme top of the screen. This makes no sense and on my new Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the app is basically using up 10% of my screen at the extreme top. And because of the location on my large screen, it is simply not comfortable to try reaching to the very top to tap and paste. Bottom line is I've now stopped using the app as it is so cumbersome for the reasons I mentioned above. I'm writing this review in the hopes that Google will consider some much needed changes to the Android version to make it more user-friendly, as I used it frequently on my iPhone and never had an issue."

Complains of no internet connection even in off-line mode. Complains about internet connection even when there is one. About the only thing that seems somewhat reliable is text translation and the ability to show a full screen card, but had to be partially psychic to know you have to rotate the phone for that to work. Great concept but utterly amateur execution. Edit: Apparently rotating my phone to get the full screen rotated text is also unreliable. Not working anymore. So other than the translation function nothing in this app seems to work reliably. I'm not sure how software this bad gets released."

Google Translate doesn't have to be so bad. With only a few lines of code they could fix a lot of the problems with Thai. For example, ครับ and ค่ะ at the end of sentences don't actually change the meaning of the sentence, except to make it a little more polite. Yet because Google doesn't want to get its hands ""dirty"" by gently nudging its machine learning in this direction, then EVERY sentence that ends with these polite words gets a WAY different translation than the ones without them. I recommend that Google hires a linguist that understands at least a few Asian languages....and LISTENS to her or him."

RESPONSE/EDIT: Thanks for the reply Google as I appreciate and highly respect this company. (Even wearing an Android shirt now). However, I know translations won't ever be perfect and I don't know how to know what the language I'm translating actually says as that's what this app is for. All I know is the translation to English sometimes is hard to make out and I don't want to make wrong suggestions.That is EVERY app though. My REAL big issue is the second part. Chrome store has a google translate app for browsers so ANY webpage can be translated any time. This app only offeres webpage translation when it feels like it. THIS is my big issue. Will there ever be a fix for this? If so, I promise to rate 5 star, as any competing app then wouldn't ever be able to compare."

Also, one phone has functional real-time camera translation whereas the other must first take a photo and then translate. Why the inconsistency? Is it due to the amount of memory or storage available? Please ALERT us so that we know a function won't work and why so that we can remedy the situation. I now load phrases i may need and star them. It's great that Google saves the phrases so that they can be used offline (without the voice output function which would have been helpful since many people don't understand Traditional Chinese but do understand spoken Chinese. Now I make sure to load phrases in both T&S). These are work-arounds/tips. I'd prefer offline translation was available as promised, however. Main phone: Note3 running Lollipop. Other phone which gets more offline functionality: Moto G 2nd Gen Android 6.0. I freed up 1GB of my storage (Note3) and that didn't help. Maybe this new update will help."

I've been impressed with the app's programed understanding of slang and cultural innuendos. That's something that is difficult for even the moderately fluent multi-lingual translator. Being more than just bi-lingual, the tri- or even the quadri- or penti-lingual user will be able to discern what the defferences between innuendo, slang or humor from what is the literal or the absolute translation of a phrase or text. Losing meaning in translation is no longer a problem for the person who is translating a foreign language into American English or even Canadian English. The nuanced differences in regional dialects and styles is already in the app. For instance, French comes in about 12 different styles or dialects- a translation for each country or region that speaks French. Perfect for the rising Francophone who needs to understand the regional differences between French in France and French spoken in Haiti or what the French Language Institute has determined to be authentic.

Was pretty stupid to think when I want to ask for six hundred in another language the translator gives me 600. Pretty frustrating. So far my only problem with this app is I need Serbian offline and it doesn't exist on this app. I gave three stars. Would have been five if Serbian was available offline. Just got a response from Google partly in English and partly in some other language I didn't understand. Asking for something I didn't understand because it wasn't in English. Epic fail. Dropped them from three stars to two. Next time they pull this I'll look elsewhere.

You should always double check spellings and if you think something is amiss then manipulate spellings to find similar words. I have been using it for six months on a daily basis and have had major success with it.

The input window becomes too small and I find myself constantly scrolling up and down to look for typos (i use the swipe keyboard). It would be really useful to add a grab area between the input and the output to resize them to be larger or smaller. Or alternatively add an option checkbox to keep both input and output stacked and visible (when ticked) or stacked and not visible (when unticked).

Was working fine until a few weeks ago, now it shows a permanent ""No network"" error whenever I try to translate anything from the camera (or even if I bypass the camera and try to upload a stored picture). It's not my network as it works fine for every other app, and won't even let me bypass the Network with the offline packs either, it just refuses to work, period."
4671,Rakshanda Arora,"January 5, 2020",5, This is not just one of the best.. It is the greatest of all translation apps.. You won't be disappointed in downloading it plus it will help you out in the learning part as well more specifically

4681,Luca Puddu,"December 23, 2019",3," Tap to translate is inconsistent. The first time, it translates text drawing over the current app; on subsequent translations, it just opens the Google translate app. Why is that?"

Translated between English and chinese literally on the fly. Full 5 stars. But recently the app has become ""impatient"". Microphone stops listening in the middle of my sentence.

I had used it previously, before your improvements, to locate industry specific words in the languages in which I am already fluent. I found it inadequate.
