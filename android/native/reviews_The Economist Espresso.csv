And when I found this , it's been a game changer. Espresso gives me critical world updates in a quick 10 minute read. No more,no less. Do you miss out on some other news ?yes. But honestly there is so much noise this is just the perfect sweetspot . A fantastic way to unplug from the media churning machine and focus."
1,patrick mcdougall,"April 13, 2020",1," The app is stuck on April 1, 2020 and we are cancelling the subscription because there is no way to get tech help on the Economist website without paying a service who cannot respond to a question. This is a very disappointing product."
2,Lucas Smith,"April 23, 2020",4," Doesn't automatically load the current day's news. I have to swipe to refresh. Sometimes, it can't load today's news at all. Otherwise I really enjoy the app."
3,Natascha Talos,"March 24, 2020",5," Great format! Perfect lenght of articles, very reduced and focussed on the essential for getting informed in the morning. The only suggestion I would have is to link further readings if the reader is interested in getting more insights on a topic"
4,Nemanja Borovac,"April 17, 2020",4," Great little app. One thing that breaks the experience, somewhat, is the inability to switch the dates with a simple swipe on the main screen."
5,Jeff Neuser,"April 11, 2020",5," I currently enjoy it a lot. They improved the page-swiping functionality, which was the main reason I deleted the app the first time."
6,Debasis Roy,"April 2, 2020",4," Good source of summary information. However, more often than not that app doesn't load smoothly."
7,Nicholas MacCallum,"April 3, 2020",1, Impossibly difficult to unsubscribe from this service. It's like they just want you to pay forever! Very disappointed in an otherwise impressive publisher.
8,Doug Macintosh,"April 24, 2020",4," The app is fine, but the real strength of The Economist is the deeper articles of its weekly edition."
9,Barbara,"April 18, 2020",5, Brilliant and incredible news reporting. Espresso gives the depth of stories in the time I have to read in the morning.
10,Rene Peritz,"April 23, 2020",5, A useful app. Would recommend a broader choice of data on trending topics affecting national interests or priorities.
11,Jax Shadow,"April 9, 2020",5, Love this app and the Economist content. I start every morning with my coffee in one hand and my espresso on my phone in the other hand.

17,Simon Moppett,"April 18, 2020",5, This is a great coffee time read and is condensed enough that it's enjoyable.
18,Daniel Clarke,"April 24, 2020",4, Good app offering 7 articles of in depth news around the world. Shame there are still adverts considering it's a paid app.
19,Matt Candeloro,"April 7, 2020",4, Nice brief daily curation. Wish it linked to more in depth coverage frequently
20,Eamon Nerbonne,"April 23, 2020",5," Well curated news feed, just a few minutes of reading a day."

27,Anders Johnson,"April 1, 2020",5, Informative and seemingly unbiased news source.
28,Edward Moon,"March 10, 2020",4," I like the short snappy overview Espresso gives you with little fuss, a well designed app and easily browsable. It would be even better if I could get an audio version on my Google Home, the Economist radio snippets I have in my morning briefing are fab and espresso would be a great addition."
29,bogdanabotez,"March 16, 2020",1," Bought a subscription, when attempting to login it cannot find my user. I click on reset pwd, receive email, reset it, try again, same failure. Cannot get in no matter what, and there's no option to create a new account. Canceling subscription."
30,Joshua Goering,"February 17, 2020",3," They need to have this cast enabled and/or linked to a Google Nest Home account so it pairs with Google smart speakers. I like to listen to this when I get ready in the morning but I have to mirror my entire phone to do it. From a content side, it's excellent. The articles are perfectly sized."
31,Peter Firkin,"April 21, 2020",4, Good taster coverage that gives useful perspective
32,Ryan Carter,"February 17, 2020",3," Great when it works; as of this writing, in Feb '20, it's been working for at least a couple of weeks. Before that were at least a few months of the app insisting it had no internet connectivity."
33,Jim Faherty,"February 17, 2020",5," Bite-sized daily rundown of global news with the option to link to the full Economist articles online. Wonderful idea for those who drink their news on-the-go, or simply don't have time to read every page."
34,Zack Dunn,"February 14, 2020",5," I've loved reading The Economist for years now, and the Espresso edition is perfect for bite-sized chunks on busy mornings.

My politics come to me in a short summary rather than paragraphs of gossip. With Espresso I know I'm reading the most important developments and I get a clearer understanding with zero ""infotainment"" factors. The app even compliments you for reading every story each morning and gives you a thoughtful quote at the end."
35,Fredrik Scherst√©n,"February 1, 2020",5," Excellent way to get a short news update. Would be great if I could listen to these news updates in podcast format , just like the digital magazine. Request for the future, it would make a great app even better."
36,Oleg Litvinenko,"February 5, 2020",5," Informational, relevant and straight to the point. Just like a good espresso, it hits the spot every time. Couldn't think of a better companion to my morning coffee."

38,Marco Sanchez,"January 26, 2020",4," Ads even with a subscription. I would give it 5 if you could turn this off.

More articles about important current events, company insights, the economy & markets would also warrant 5 stars. I read the economist to go away from the noise of mainstream media articles about the entertainment industry etc - include them in your main site if you have to; it's not that important to include in a morning digest."
39,Molly Clark,"March 24, 2020",5, Excellent summary of daily headlines.
40,Sam Waling,"January 8, 2020",5, Great way to head into the day and get highlights on current events before I get a chance to read the full economist edition.

Gives me a headsup on what to keep an eye on in the following days in news/media. The app is easy to use and encourages a healthy habit of staying informed with simple short articles that give the BLUF.
41,christine abelarde,"February 13, 2020",3, It doesn't update for the last 3 days now. It's Feb 13th now and the last daily news was shown as Feb 10th. I tried to relogin but the same. I also tried to relaunch the app a few times but still the same
42,Stefan Stanev,"February 11, 2020",5," It is impressive how concise but yet elaborate the news are in this app. I was hoping for the audio option as with the main Economist app, but even this way it is great"

47,Michael Jarvis,"February 5, 2020",4," Really like the app. Am only using free trial, but it's a little bit annoying you get ads despite having to pay a subscription."
48,Paul Lascelles,"February 27, 2020",3, The information brief is great but the monthly charges are excessive. I'd expect more from a regular payment service.
49,Jackson Zhang,"January 21, 2020",4," Good app. However, sometimes the UI is buggy and the links do not work/load. You would expect a more smoother experience for the amount of money you pay."
50,A Google user,"April 2, 2020",5," Good way to start the day, especially with the health and economic crisis upon us."

54,Steve Broyles,"January 20, 2020",5," Simple, quick, and with just enough gamification to help engage me on stories I might otherwise skip. The reporting quality is very good. I would like to see more links to dive deeper into a given news segment"
55,Virtual Freelancer,"February 11, 2020",4," Limited amount of news every morning. However, good quality journalism."
56,Bill Owens,"March 13, 2020",5," The Espresso's succinct vignettes of global News, not covered locally, keeps me current. Thank you"
57,Mick De Winter,"January 13, 2020",5, Works well except for using a vpn. So if you are using one you have to disable it temporarily to download the articles before turning it back on.
58,Patrick Anderson,"January 7, 2020",5," This app is the best quick way to get your news, with only a few short articles I get everything I need while still laying in be in the morning."

67,Andrew Sharick,"January 21, 2020",4," Since the last update, Espresso won't work. It says 'device not connected to internet.' But new update (Jan 2020) has fixed the problem!"

71,Duncan Cooper,"February 16, 2020",1, App stopped receiving push notifications. No warning I was going to be charged. Economist then via google play linked my app to my wife's economist account an started charging her without her permission. Really bad practice.
72,Duncan Macmillan,"January 6, 2020",5," Beautifully presented, succinct news that gives me a middle way between a zero-calorie news fast and excessive attention to feel-bad events."

83,Andy Awad,"April 18, 2020",5, Excellent and serves its purpose perfectly.

149,Uwe Roepke,"November 12, 2019",5, I like the brief information set. I am a busy person and sometimes don't have enough time to read the the most important news of around the globe. But Espresso keeps it brief and I can bookmark to dive in deeper later on . Thanks.
150,Daniel Cruz,"November 6, 2019",5," The app is wonderful and easy to use, and the idea of a compressed morning briefing is great as well. I just wish the main economist app were this well-designed, then I might use it more."

And honestly it...Full ReviewOverall I really like the idea of this app. I enjoy the bite size chunks of information across the world and the additional links on complex topics to longer economist reads. I think it costs too much for what it is... you're basically paying $1 per 100 words. And you still have ads! And honestly it's a bit biased, dissapointingly.

Its more detailed than the news briefings I listen to on google but obviously less than a newspaper - so perfect for my needs. Has links to articles for further reading and basic market information. A broad range of topics covering political, financial and international news. Saturdays seem to be culture focused and there is nothing on Sundays.

250,Earnell Kelly,"January 11, 2019",5, Great app. Articles are perfect length and number to read in 5 to 6 minutes. Easy way to stay informed on top world news.
251,Matt Rodrigues,"December 18, 2018",4, Great app for daily updates. Nice and pithy. Love the quotes at the end. Only recommended improvement would be to include optional tracking of specific stocks.
252,Amit Kale,"October 11, 2018",5, Was craving to have Espresso on my phone because i had heard a lot about it. I subscribed recently and got this app now. What a wonderful app.. Superb content presented nicely to be consumed while sipping the coffee. Wow...
253,Aiden Graham,"February 20, 2019",4, A handy app to keep on top of major stories. slightly frustrating that it still contaims so many adverts for what is after all a paid platform.
254,Steven Hall,"September 14, 2018",5," Short, sweet, and to the point. Likely one of the best ways to consume well thought out, well written articles if you don't have the time to sit down an read an entire issue of the Economist."
255,Alex Russ,"June 10, 2019",3, Great idea and decent execution at a nice price. would like it more if 1. Articles had a bulletpoint sumnary at the stsrt 2. Articles contained links to other articles for further reading
256,Nathan Stone,"August 15, 2019",4," Crashes somewhat rarely. Enjoy the short articles (YSK that this reviewer does have a subscription). its good that you can see stories from previous days. Can be somewhat slow, may just be my phone."
257,K A,"March 4, 2020",5, Quick and informative
258,Gill Thompson,"April 16, 2019",4, This is a really helpful app. I'm unsure why is is charged for as it is good PR and advertising for The Economist. This may stop me using it long term.
259,Ezco Ez,"April 5, 2019",5," Great news recap of main stories around the world. Goes well with commute, a cup of coffee or beverage of your choice."
260,A Google user,"November 16, 2018",5," Still the best short read daily briefing for a global perspective, put out by The Economist, which produces arguably the best balanced in-depth reporting on the planet."
261,A Google user,"January 7, 2019",5, love this app! so quick and easy to use and some great updates. I'd reccomend this to anyone looking for a bitesized update on the world in the morning.

266,Jack Jones,"March 3, 2020",5, Great app and insight with a fact based worldview. Highly recommended
267,S Ang,"October 19, 2018",5, Very easy to navigate and simple. Gives me my news while I sip my coffee at work. Definitely a must for people looking for a daily briefing on the world.
268,Bruno Archer,"May 6, 2019",4, Very interesting but a little bit pricey compared to a global monthly/annual subscription of The Economist magazine (Espresso content is included within it). PS: I'm a paying user anyway.
269,Edward Silla,"October 26, 2018",5, It's brilliant. üòÅ. You zip through the üì∞ news very well and quickly thus keeping abreast of the day's news. You can rely on the information and update. üíï‚ù§Ô∏èLoved it. üòç
270,Patrick Humpal,"May 24, 2019",5," Brief, informative and quip filled. Easily digestible with links to more in depth content. Intuitive UI. Massive kudos on execution."
271,Maurice Balick,"April 23, 2019",5, It is the perfect morning briefing. The name describes exactly what it is: the essence of what one needs to know on a daily basis and great aroma to boot! I love it.
272,Tremaine McKinley,"January 23, 2019",5," I've enjoyed these quick, daily updates that are typically the useful information devoid of partisanship, at least as an US citizen."
273,Philip Goldsmith,"July 1, 2019",2," was a five star app until the markets page was ""suspended for maintenance"" in April. It's now July and still no markets page. How much maintenance can there be? Where's the update reinstating that page?"
274,Mike Merunka,"May 6, 2019",1," Very little is actually accessible. Only one, two paragraph stories available before I'm blocked for the day or asked to pay. Uninstalled this app after about a week."
275,A Google user,"April 20, 2019",5," Photographs that accompany articles should be viewable fullscreen. I would also suggest a change of name, how about ""The Short Economist"""
276,Melissa Waye,"January 23, 2019",5, Neat app that comes with the Economist subscription. I think the free trial (one article a day) is not sufficient for user to grasp the benefit from it though.
277,A Google user,"January 25, 2019",5," The economist provides a different selection of news and current affairs from other sources, relevant, well analysed, and usually humorous."
278,Joel Ewing,"March 16, 2020",5, Solid news summary to start the day.
279,Romeo Sharon,"March 3, 2019",5, The choice of incidents are emblematic of important trends. The language is crisp and puts the incident in context.
280,Briar Harte,"April 8, 2019",3, Interesting and succinct style. The content isn't always ready at the start of each day which is a bit annoying.
281,Jure Piƒçulin,"July 24, 2019",3," A great app, but lately it doesn't update reliably before opening it so you often end up without the stories if there's no signal."
282,Abir Rane,"September 7, 2019",5, Great asset to get updated on the key happenings around the globe. And the length of the articles is just right so you can cover a range of topics. Full marks!
283,Alex Reynolds,"September 15, 2019",5, I have a busy life and don't want to put hours aside to read the news. Espresso makes it short and sweet and the stories that peak my interest I can simply look further into. Great app!
284,banhid bhattacharya,"October 19, 2019",5, Offers Great brief and balcony view on most relevant topics. It certainly helps to remain up to date while such a deluge of changes taking place everywhere...

292,Ladi Ashwe,"January 30, 2019",5, The app provides a daily (except Sunday) snippet of global issues. The articles are concise and it's easy to go through them all in a few minutes.
293,David Boehm,"September 13, 2018",5," Best short news app. Format is clean, concise. Everything you need to know in less than 5 mins."
294,Emily B,"January 26, 2019",5, the app has bite sized chunks of daily news that are mainly international and include cultural and scientific developments my other news apps don't cover. Very interesting.
295,David Flowers,"April 15, 2019",1, couldn't use without opening an account and then payment would start automatically unless I remembered to cancel. did not like that idea.
296,Juan Uribe,"June 16, 2019",5, I like the way the news are displayed. It would be better if you could get 10 articles and a more indepth world summary.
297,Ly Tran,"July 31, 2019",5, I enjoy the brief highlights that deliver a good breadth of current events every morning. the only way I could enjoy this more is if I could read it on a regular computer.
298,Chris von Krogh,"October 7, 2019",5," Perfect companion app for the Economist, but I would also recommend as standalone, even if that's not how I use it."
299,William Arroyo,"August 13, 2019",5," Fantastic and most importantly, concise content delivered daily. Economist Espresso is the world's debriefing in 10 minutes or less."
300,Nuno Bandeira,"August 23, 2019",5," Very nice daily overview of global news, as well as some fun topics on weekends. Apps works great with no glitches."
301,Jordan Easton,"October 28, 2019",4, Very informative app. Would be nice if you could select all regions so you can catch all the stories in one go rather than toggling back and forth.
302,A Google user,"April 18, 2019",5, A perfect complement to my Subscription to Australia's national newspaper (The Australian) and a preview to my equally appreciated subscription to The Economist.
303,Michael Bowling,"October 1, 2018",5," Critical news in a nutshell, and written with humor and erudition. What could be better!"
304,John Armstrong,"January 15, 2019",5," Great app, concise updates to global issues works well independently or as an expansion to the magazine."
305,Thomas Lydon,"January 25, 2019",4, Simple to use but ads are a bit inconsistent in when they appear so a bit frustrating. Also a shame that paying Economist subscribers dont have ads removed

311,Timo Gollub,"November 26, 2018",3, Just recently have risen their subscription costs by 40% while I was in their free trial... This is an exorbitant increase in costs which makes you think thrice before subscribing.

322,Franx Cuckoo,"June 24, 2019",2, You pay and then they show you advertising...That is unheard of. Also very short articles. Good content and selection of subjects nevertheless.
323,Liam Davenport,"February 18, 2019",3," Great app. This should be stand alone from economist for, say, 99p. Rather than needing to subscribe to the magazine"
324,Jean Bobillier,"April 16, 2019",5," Very well written and in deapth looks at a wide range of topics, worth every penny!"
325,Mehmet Marcoczy,"June 9, 2019",1," Heavily advertised, and not ""free"" . Free trial does not cut it, and I will not pay."

341,Vikalp Aggarwal,"June 3, 2019",3, Great content. But slow and heavy for a paid service.
342,roger driscoll,"July 31, 2019",4," Enjoy the bite sized news snippets. Disappointed that Markets & Currencies page still not available re maintenance. Would prefer to see that page back, rather than Quotation page at end."
343,taeyang dong,"November 21, 2019",5," Good & precise recap of what to read in more detail in accordance to your interest or need to know basis, in a more time saving manner"
344,Reality Bites,"February 8, 2019",1," Doesn't seem to work directly from China, nor does it seem to work via a VPN, hence unusable. Will give it a couple more tries, then it is deletion time."

362,A Google user,"December 9, 2018",4, Great for distilled world news for the time poor i.e. 5 minutes of key world news 6 out of 7 days is achievable but reading The Economist is not (for me). Would give it 5 stars if articles could be saved in evernote or another app.

371,Rupak Laskar,"April 18, 2019",5, The first news source to read every morning. Unmatched topic coverage yet crisp enough to finish on the go.

384,Tony Apuzzo,"November 29, 2018",2, Did not give me enough of a reason to subscribe. I don't want to deal with signing up for a free trial. Just show me what you've got. One article isn't enough if you're going to slam my notifications you better deliver the goods. Uninstalled.

I do appreciate that they frequently own up to their mistakes by publishing the errata. That said, Espresso is just the right amount of news info for a busy morning. There are some links to more in-depth articles, but they could stand to add more. Espresso is never intimidating and I usually look forward to checking the feed. I am much better informed on world events because of this app."
1194,Bob Hall,"March 2, 2020",1," Espresso is still utterly brilliant and a 'must read'. The continual nagging to rate it is VERY much the opposite. However, it's down to a single star for insulting a long-time Economist subscriber - me - with annoying requests to re-rate the app. So I did."
1195,Neil Dunlop,"March 24, 2020",5," This one simply works, unlike the Economist app which failed. Good to have concise stories with the clarity of the Economist. Great pictures too. Compared to print the images are much sharper and more colourful on Samsung Galaxy S10"
1196,Medhanie Kidane,"February 18, 2020",4," This is a good app to have for your daily intake on current issues. So much is going on and they try to bring you the best the they can.

Now, after having subscribed through Google Play, the app tells me I don't have an active subscription, even though I have one that is paid for until January 2020, and works fine on the actual Economist app. I have contacted both The Economist customer support and the app designer, and to date, nobody's solutions have been able to fix this very annoying problem. No refund available, either."

It's still true) years later, still true"
1249,Eric Bryan,"September 26, 2019",5," Like the full magazine, it provides thought provoking information, but daily, and in small bites. Nothing in the mainstream US news media comes close to the Economist for intelligence, wit, and good sense."
1250,Zach Addison,"December 11, 2019",3, What happened the major indices and commodities daily section? That was a useful glance as this is often my first read of the morning. Bring it back.
1251,Arthur Wharton,"November 14, 2019",5, too little content but more wd defeat the purpose. the flyover view on app start is always fun. Definitely worth a look.

Occasional Americanisms creep in to the writing, but this is tolerable. Advertising is not overly intrusive and can be skipped. Updates have rendered the app less ergonomic.

1384,A Google user,"February 2, 2019",5," Good app and content, but if you wait 1 - 4 days the content appears in the newspaper so the app is not essential. I updated my review as they improved the app by removing video"

1386,John Sherer,"December 15, 2018",4," No way to search the archives. For a publication that poses as an economic daily brief, it in fact is a daily blip, lost after a week's turn. However, the news is indeed quite good."
1387,Carlos Malaga,"February 4, 2019",5, Continues to be the best resum√© of important news. Love to wake up and have all the major news in a concise and easy to read format. The addition of a Saturday edition is a welcome addition. It is also loading faster on weak connections.

1389,Gary Vernon,"February 22, 2019",4," Works OK. Sometimes slow to load. Either the app has improved or my phones have now got so powerful that the previously clunky behaviour is no longer noticeable. Anyway, it's the content that matters, not the app, and the content is world class."

You can have a login to the Economist, but no subscription; How about 
making that plain as day and explicit here in Espresso? How about saying, 
Your subscription to the Economist has expired."" Or even go one step 
further and say, ""so your ability to use Espresso has expired as well, even 
though Your login may still work on the Economist, but not here."" [ I'm 
being facetious: three words would work, ""Economist Subscription Expired""] 
That would have been useful. I wasted considerable time setting & resetting

information is absorbed, and your day is enriched."
1757,Heidi Smith,"February 3, 2018",4," The only problem is I get multiple notifications from the Economist every morning: one for each story in their morning round-up.

The newspaper itself is good, but should you ever want to cancel your subscription, be prepared for (1) not having an option to cancel on their website, (2) your email requests being ignored repeatedly, (3) being asked to call a UK number for a US based customer, and (4) your subscription being auto-renewed at intransparent rates without prior notification. As of writing this review, I have now been trying to cancel my subscription for months without success.   Sad to see that an otherwise great newspaper so sorely lacks in customer service! Stay away from subscribing.   Free digital access can be had though many libraries."
2305,Robert Clark,"October 24, 2017",2," 2.50 a month for articles that hardly inform much and the app keeps forcing advertisement articles under your nose. Rubbish app for what is, on printed paper, a top magazine."

2310,Erik van Luxzenburg,"October 31, 2017",5," Great to have daily updates from the economist about the news that matters. Goes well with espresso, though one can take a cappuccino, regular coffee or tea as well"

2366,On Takahashi,"October 10, 2017",5," It's a great source of everyday news. Since the Espresso covers a lot of the points that will later be explained in the weekly magazine edition, it allows to skip parts of the magazine and allows us to focus out time on special reports and other articles not covered in the Espresso."

The biggest downside - the app has no ""unsubscribe"" button or a how-to for doing so in their FAQ. After some phone calls I realized I had to do it through the Google app store. Frustrating process - would be helpful to know this (via Google adding on an info button or the app itself)."
2406,Adam Leighton,"September 29, 2017",5," I avoid a lot of traditional news media because it tends to be a bloated waste of attention. Because of this I found myself out of the loop with major world news. This app is a great balance, with concise updates on the worlds current events."

Content is increasingly getting buried in useless spam, both advertising and content marketing, including their useless videos, from The Economist group whose new (old) owners appear to aspire to get down to YouTube standards of reporting. Please let us turn off junk."

2418,Sascha R.,"August 30, 2017",5," Brilliant by simplicity: get 8 short stories each day. If there's you have no interest in, you swipe to get to the next. The content is, of course, The Economist and I like the selection of daily articles."

2610,A Google user,"July 10, 2017",1, Requires access to body sensors? I find this creepy and intrusive. Why would a simple news app require the permissions this app asks for? I instantly deleted it. I'll get the same news from elsewhere thanks.

2848,Charlie Dangio,"April 27, 2017",5," Excellent round up of daily news by the Economist. My only wish was that it was a little less business and a little more policy focused, but the commentary is short, to the point, informative, and essential to my day."

Opening Google News or other free news aggregators gives me far too much sensational and narrow material engineered to get page views.

Having retired has not kept me from ""ingesting"" The Economist, however the format. It doesn't seem like long ago that if I happened to be traveling when the new issue was delivered by the mailman, I would scour the various airport lounges where more often that not, it was where I could find a copy of an issue. Things have sure changed, not The Economist. Thank goodness."

However, it's a resource pig. On a 5 year old device it was slow, failed sometimes, and took way too much storage. On a more current, powerful device it's still a pig, but the device can carry it. The new videos are a laudable experiment, but not yet good. So far the only content is ""talking heads"", which prose delivers more efficiently. They should use video to deliver visuals."

The rest of  the time it provides a soberingly newsworthy collection of articles that are relevant that day.

It notified me of a new museum exhibit that was opening that day at the Victoria and Albert, so I went and had a great time.

3107,A Google user,"December 7, 2016",4,It's ok but some niggles Content is good but interface not quite right. I would prefer it if I could select different days on the screen without going to settings. It should really cache multiple days. Perhaps a setting to cache a week or two weeks or a month or forever? And automatically download on WiFi without prompting.
3108,Atin Jain,"January 8, 2017",4,"Crisp round-up of world events Although I almost daily use Espresso but it uses a huge amount of data to load and sometimes when I don't get enough bandwidth, it shows the previous day's news. I wish developers will lower application's data consumption or atleast streamline it."
3109,Andrew Cowie,"December 30, 2016",2,"Deathly slow The daily summaries are nice, but this app takes over 15 seconds to load (after a notification said it was ""ready""). Linked articles don't take you to Economist app. Effort on this could have been spent making the real app better for subscribers."
3110,Jackie Sequeira,"January 6, 2017",4,"Great for a quick update Really like the app, and the quick info bites. The only thing I find frustrating is that at times I see the try again later dialogue, sometimes many times in a row. It happens on wifi and data, so it seems to be an issue with the app or the Economist. Otherwise, great for daily rundown."
3111,Nilay Kamdar,"December 6, 2016",4,"Brilliantly concise Far better than long winded articles, but best of all succinct and concise enough to summarise major developments in the world.  Only suggestion is the ability to swap exchange rates to convert from one to the other without calculating the reverse."
3112,Tim Edwards,"January 2, 2017",4,"Great news summary, minor technical flaws A very interesting and useful summary of news around the world. Minor technical flaws - it always comes up with the 'this is taking a while try later' loading message even on a fast connection"
3113,A Google user,"December 5, 2016",5,"Great App the Economist deserves This app boils down the news to just the most relevant and important stories of the day. The design is easy to use, and it allows me to get to the meat of a story and move on with my life everyday."
3114,Jimmy Lehman,"January 21, 2017",4," A nice addition to a weekly subscription service. Only complaint is loading at startup; I still don't understand why it states ""try back later"" when it takes a couple seconds to load - I'm not that concerned about the time, just the annoyance of the message"

As I understand, it was released but a week ago.  [Ed: The following is all still true two years on.] The time to open in the morning is absurdly long. Even if the entire content needed to be loaded, that should still be under a tenth of a second. And a common app complaint: there's no feedback mechanism to the developers, let alone an open feature/bug tracking system offering transparency into problems encountered and developer reaction/fixes."
3117,William Petrick,"January 11, 2017",5,Great way to stay up to date Need a quick knowledge fix? Get the app. The Economist isn't cheap but one of the best news sources on the planet.

I especially enjoy two features:  1) The world in brief section -- the real reason why I downloaded the app in the first place. A quick overview of the world today;  2) Kal draws... -- this is not available in every edition, but every now and then the Espresso offers a short cartoon explaining the basic stuff, such as inflation and taxation.  There are twp reasons why I didn't rate Espresso as excellent, and these may be unfair. Anyway:  1) No Espresso on Sundays! 2) Not enough news about the Philippines (granted, this is entirely unfair).  Otherwise a wonderful app. In my country it costs me about the same as a large cup of Starbucks coffee per month. I think it's totally worth it."
3121,Katrin Cismaru,"January 15, 2017",5,"Nice way to stay the morning It is a bit buggy, but they're fixing it. And I really do love starting my day with coffee and Espresso."

3128,Harish Rajkumar,"December 8, 2016",5,"Excellent sip of news for my mornings It gives key highlights from the previous day and covers a wide range of topics.

The new video function is really appreciated and the content is interesting most of the time, though interests vary, the economist delivers a very round up experience that everyone can learn from and enjoy.

3134,Robbie Capps,"December 15, 2016",5,Great snippets! My only complaint is that the subscription is a little outside my monthly budget right now.

3139,Chris O'Bleness,"December 29, 2016",5,"Great App App functions treat, and provides an ideal amount of news for someone who finds it hard to sit down and read the newspaper. Definitely a great addition for people who subscribe to the economist, but perhaps not worth paying for on its own for most users."

What I want to emphasize is how wonderfully put together the app is. Each day, you get a convenient agenda. You can tap into any article, but I prefer to read it from bottom to top.

4310,Louise NCTJ Diploma,"April 16, 2016",4,"Great app Really excellent round up of news Monday to Friday. The Saturday output is a little disappointing though, with arts based articles very London centric."
4311,Kieran Crean,"April 18, 2016",5,Quick and informative Interesting news stories that can be read in 5min. Tends to always be something different than what you get from skimming a broadsheets website. Adds value to the economist subscription.
4312,rahul sah,"April 16, 2016",5,"Condensed news that matters This is a great way to catch up with the daily news. Some content is so important that you have to be updated about it, other so offbeat that you won't find it anywhere else. Nevertheless, you'll be a lot wiser having read either. Great job."
4313,npbetts1,"May 27, 2016",5,Good when it works. Decided to try it again after giving up on it because of a freezing problem on my Nexus 9. Looks like they finally fixed it. Now it works perfectly.

4325,Richard Strauch,"April 16, 2016",5,"Great app I use this app every morning, and it's great, especially since I traded my S3 in for an S6. No problems freezing or crashing anymore!"
4326,ben jason,"May 19, 2016",5,"Perfect companion to the Economist Brief snippets with just a bit of supporting data suffices to whet the appetite. In a few cases the report is too similar to a more comprehensive Economist article, but this does not detract from a useful and focussed app, much better than simple aggregators."
4327,Dan Rudy,"April 11, 2016",5,"A great start to the day Espresso is a nifty application, and compliments my weekly Economist with fresh snippets of news each morning over breakfast. Worth downloading, but remember to empty its cache files now and then as they do accumulate."

4329,Bill Rhodes,"May 2, 2016",5,Short and sweet--just how I like it Great for the person who might not have a lot of time in the morning to read many full-length articles about the day biggest headlines. Additionally enjoyable as these stories come from an economics perspective. Good stuff.
4330,Darin Briskman,"April 13, 2016",5,A daily spoonful of the world Each morning I can sip espresso while reading Espresso. I always gain insight into at least one event or trend that I had not previously considered.

4334,Intellectual Yo,"May 22, 2016",2," The premise of the app might be swell hut the fact that I'm being prompted to buy a subscription every 30 seconds is bothering.  I myself am a media professional and understand that the free online content model can't sustain. But then again, no need to masquerade the app as free."
4335,Kenneth Shaw,"May 11, 2016",5,"The Fantastic Espresso (Corto) Gives a great brief on world news and is the prefect coffee-buddy. The app has been running smoothly for more than a year and keeps me updated every day. The news is well written and varied, covering all the major present topics."

4337,Alejandro Ortiz,"April 29, 2016",4,"Please allow customization I love this app, the only thing I think could be done to improve it would be to enable users to follow their own stocks indices and currency prices"

4340,Richard Bowles,"May 13, 2016",4,Short digest that I use regularly Handy digest that I find more convenient than the full Economist weekly.  Useful links to full articles and short enough to read over breakfast.

4351,Jim Cobbe,"April 14, 2016",5,Good brief Economist's view on five stories of international significance plus very short summary of what important happened the day before.  Some indices and exchange rates topped off by an interesting quote.  Worth five minutes in the morning.

Two things could be better: 1) You could offer a super condensed summary in one/two bullets on the top of each article.

4764,James Carmichael,"April 6, 2016",5,"Great idea; much improved execution I had technical issues with a previous version, but updates seem to have eliminated them (Moto G, 3rd gen).

4768,Carl Monk,"April 4, 2016",5,Pint size news The pint size daily overview of global news is a perfect fit for people with busy schedules. I only wish it was published 7 x / wk as opposed to 6. I also enjoy the artsy Saturday version since i quickly peruse news that i would otherwise not read.

Great news variety and coverage, and they mostly get their stock ticker correct.  Old review:... but the service isn't. They have a built-in feedback system that is deeply flawed, I've used it several times and they always come back telling me ""we don't see that you're a subscriber to our magazine"", apparently they just can't figure out they have more than one service/revenue stream. And the issue I keep asking them about is their app's failure to properly update the performance of the S&P. It's pretty basic, I've prompted them 3 times now, and they've done nothing nor have they responded. Meh."

However, all of the time the app comes with the warning that 'things need some time' (regardless of the access).

For those of you who are familiar with the print edition, this resembles the ""News in Brief,"" but with a bias toward finance and business news. They recently added a Saturday issue that tries to make up for this bias, but I'm not entirely satisfied.  This app is also not very good software. It is also annoyingly slow to load (10 seconds or so). Considering that I don't get to this app for a few hours after the day's issue is actually published, this is inexplicable. One day recently, I couldn't get the day's issue at all until the next day. There's also been a persistent issue with the reporting of market indices."
5072,Kevin Flickinger,"November 28, 2015",5,nice daily capsules This is a great concept to get beyond reading only headlines but still 5 minutes or less on day's top news and issues. Adding Saturday edition bumps it from 4 to 5 stars

5783,Matt Soave,"November 14, 2014",5,"Nice and simple This app is well designed in its simplicity. One nice-to-have would be scroll indicators, but it's not a big deal since the articles are so short anyway."
5784,franklin Moore,"November 26, 2014",5,Streamlined articles A very simple and informative way to get selected important news. I feel that due to time restrictions I will read this more than the actual Economist Magazine. App looks good too.
5785,Nathan Hirst,"November 24, 2014",4,"I just wanted the online content in app form This app is great. Really nice simple design. I dropped one star because I was hoping to have access to all of the online content, not just one editor picked piece of content each day. I would prefer to have ads and get everything."
5786,Yohan Benizri,"November 13, 2014",4,"Almost perfect An excellent app. For a quick, trustworthy, daily briefing, I cannot think of a better source. It would be much better with an option to listen to the daily espresso!"

5788,Imran Khan,"November 14, 2014",5,Nice quick news source I don't get a lot of time to read the news but this app keeps me up to date with bite sized stories of the day
5789,Gus Paul,"November 25, 2014",2,Starts up too slow This app is great but the start up time is way too slow...especially in offline mode

5795,Mark Noonan,"November 17, 2014",1,"Cannot log-in I downloaded this app the day it was released, two weeks and numerous emails with Customer Service later and I am still unable to log-in to this app even tho my credentials work for both the main website and the main Economist app."
5796,Dewet Diener,"November 26, 2014",3,"Good first attempt The design is very nice, but the biggest annoyance is not having content available offline. I use it on the Tube, and I expect 7 articles to be fairly easy to precache."
5797,Jacob Danton,"November 14, 2014",5,Nice midweek updates Espresso offers a small set of midweek updates while maintaining the Economist approach: namely not overvaluing up-to-the-second flashy headlines and a high volume of news stories and instead focusing on distilled analysis of the top stories.
5798,David Steenfeldt,"November 13, 2014",4,Nice app Just that I can't expand the text with 2 fingers in my notification bar for a quick look. Could this be fixed?
5799,Jordan Isenberg,"November 14, 2014",5,"Great daily digest Great morning read with coffee, when will I read my local newspaper now?? Maybe add audio and increase Txt size with finger? Great job. Next please fix the economist app! Thanks!"

5857,Ricardo Davila,"November 13, 2014",3,"Good start, could benefit from more content The app is a good start, and I like the UI.  I wish the app included content from The Economist's blogs, since those articles and commentary are separate from the main journal and carry a different tone. Perhaps they Canberra included with the next edition?"
5858,Gregory Pittman,"November 11, 2014",1,"Are you serious? I don't see the point of this app. I would suggest renaming it to: A Few Economist Blurbs. There is nothing here more than a blurb. Slick interface, no content."

5884,Elias Garcia,"November 10, 2014",5,"Absolutely wonderful No other words to describe it, download it! I was legitimately upset that there wasn't more, but I feel that's the app's purpose: a sip of today's news."

5987,Sam Myers,"December 17, 2014",5,"Quality in a nutshell The articles are short, informative, and of high quality.

5991,A Google user,"January 24, 2017",3," The app is great to wake up with, and has a very nice interface. However it seems greedy to have recently added ads.

day."

6013,Robert Barrett,"August 3, 2015",5,Best succinct news app! I open The Economist espresso app every morning as I drink my cup of coffee.
