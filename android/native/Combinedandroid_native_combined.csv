The graphics are awesome and the game play is challenging. I can't think of anything that I would ask or suggest the developers to charge or improve. Well yes there is one thing; seems like after EVERY update I install, the game gets on the loading screen and just spins and spins and NEVER loads. I then have to uninstall and reinstall the game which is frustrating.",5

Asphalt 8,Racing,high, It is a very very excellent game for kids who are like me. But only 1 problem is you could give offers in all cars for like 3 days. Otherwise it is an extraordinary game. Thanks to GAMELOFT.,5
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Very nice game I have been playing it for 3 years but my only problem is there are too many things that lead you to pay to play that I hate the most but otherwise this is the perfect game in play store,5
Asphalt 8,Racing,high," another new currency you have to buy to upgrade vehicles. So credits are useless now, new players will find it even more difficult to peruse upgrade. Updates reflect nothing be greed, time to move on and find another game.",1

Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Entire game is ultimately bulit to get real fun of racing.. But one this that for every upgrade of vehicles it takes more points or else we have to purchase them.. So i request the Gameloft please reduce the purchasing options..,4

And of course fusion points and it's just stupid and unnecessary to add that, just more funds which makes the game worse, I'm not trying to be offensive or negative but seriously you need to dumb down prices and make it less pay to win.",2
Asphalt 8,Racing,high," The right mix of both difficulties, and joyfulness the game is super fun and exciting to play.",5
Asphalt 8,Racing,high," A small question. Have you asked your commercial customers if they prefer 30-50 seconds ads that nobody watches (personally, I play them when I am in front of TV) or 5-10 seconds ads that players would actually watch?",5
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Its hard to get money and the game lags when you turn on your data but still the game is pretty awesome when you play without data,4
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Asphalt 8 is a great game but I think the downloads are huge numbers bcoz it's impossible to transfer it to someone. Can't you fix it??,3

Made things more expensive and added terrible fusion coins. Gameloft, you are just trying to assassinate the game now, but one thing you dont know is that lots of people love it, and you shouldn't try to make people switch over A9 because it had better controls, so keep the game like it was before, remove fusion coins, and dont kill the game.",2

Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Your last update sucks üò° it is taking double or even triple the usual time to open game.

Asphalt 8,Racing,high," So far, so good. It's just you need to be online to get special tokens and other stuffs. And another one, we don't have any means of personalizing a car like changing its mags, or it's hood and kind of those things. But, still, the best time killer. Good Job!",4
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Why you don't update an 60fps frame version for Android? And why iOS already have unlocked it but Android user can't? I have a Mi 9 with 855 processor but the game is just capped at 30fps I can't play smoothly. Please fix it Gameloft!,1
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, I gave it 3 üåü cz the game makes me feel like I'm driving real cars n it's enjoyable But again it's just greedy that we have to use reel money to get fusion coins to upgrade cars. It was never like that before. Why asphalt why??,3

Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Scamloft killed the game with the introduction of their stupidly overpriced Fusion coin currency. Now is impossible to upgrade the cars to PRO without spending big $$$.,2

Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Gameloft you spoiled the game.Before the cars were in credits and now the cars are for tokens and some cars are only available in car packs.This before was a game of racing but now it's just a money game.,1

The graphics and the tracks are impressive. Recently I started playing this game again and restarted my progress. The reason I rated this game 3 stars cause the cars have became more expensive! for eg DS survot from B class was used to be between 7000-8000 credits (I don't rember the exact price) is now 45000 credits! This is redicouls! I request the game developers to reduce the price.,3
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, cant claim rewards from a completed multiplayer season. therefore cant complete daily events n cant participate in new season. just imagine how the developer is treating gamers like us.,1

Beyond that this game is not worth anyone's time unless you plan on spending massive amounts of real money. Like most ""progress as you go"" race games, you start out with your typical slow beginner car and are supposed to eventually tune it and tweak it and eventually buy other faster cars to continue to participate in events both career and multiplayer. Unfortunately the only way you're going to be able to do that is to spend a lot of your real cash to upgrade cars or spend many many hours repeating the same courses over and over again until your eyes bleed so you can farm the money you need to buy cars that have even half a chance against the established field of competition. After watching youtube videos on strategy I spent over $60 USD to try to follow the plan to success and my beginning cars are not even halfway to their full potential of upgrades and lightyears behind anyone I get paired with on anything multiplayer. The dollar amounts keep more than doubling to upgrade the cars to the next level and the amount of hours I'm looking at to even put a dent in the upgrades I ""need"" to keep going is just ridiculous. If I wanted to punch the same buttons over and over again, day after day with no end in sight, I would go get a factory job. Even at minimum wage it would be more rewarding than being able to brag about how fast my pretend car is after wasting real big chunks of my real time to get it. I'm just the silly one who thinks if a game is about racing fast cars you should be able to install it and race a fast car. I'm already broke and wish I had a different car in real life. I don't need Gameloft's help in pretending to be poor in a game too.",1

Admittedly, it would be nice if you didn't need to grind forever to get enough credits to upgrade things without paying real money, but it is possible to get every vehicle if you have the patience to farm the credits and tokens. However, and this is more a reflection on google play than on the app itself, this game does not have a small download size, since after it downloads the app, it then needs to download the game itself when you first open it, so it should not be advertised as having a small download size",4

The graphics are absolutely great, which means you'll need a high end device to play it comfortably. The gameplay is good, but rehashed from asphalt 8 with very few changes. People complain but the P2W aspect isn't as bad as I've seen it in other games. If you play a bit of everything and get in 10-20 races a day then you'll get daily packs and plenty of gold/premium currency. Takes a good phone and lots of grind.",4

Every time they update it, it gets bigger. It will only store about 100mb of itself on your SD card. Tons of cars. Fun game, good graphics and OK controls. I just don't like its massive and ever increasing data footprint. Motorcycle control is ridiculous and not fun or vaguely realistic. Research events and cars are only winnable by spending lots. 1st place in a race will get you 3,500 credits and watching an ad bumps that up to 7,000. High end cars cost 1 to 4 MILLION credits, so it's kind of a grind. Too many ads and pop ups. To summarize, I enjoy playing. Its a good game. But there are obviously many ways they could improve it. A default Bluetooth game controller made by Google themselves would also be nice! I mean, the Google Play symbol is a game controller, and they don't make one. Odd.",3

Of course we want shiny car details and stunning graphics. However, when too much glare cause you to mistakenly go of the edge of the road. While trying to get a nitro pickup that's near the edge of the road. That's very frustrating. Also, at some points/areas of the road it cause me to crash because I can barely see the path of what I'm driving towards. I don't have bad eyes. Even the brake lights can be too much glare light. Damn near like you driving towards the direction of the Sun when its sitting low while its rising or setting. 3. Wrecked Cars aka Unnecessary Junk Cars - Takes too long for them to clear out the road. If i cant dodge them quickly i get slowed down or crash by hit them or by hitting another object after dodge the wreckage.",4

Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Nice graphics. Nice and challenging game. But either you have to buy money packs or you have to play for a long time to buy costly cars.,4
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, I can't give you 5 star beacuse you remove the old controller of Asphalt 8 ! I am playing this game in nox player [emulator]. Now my game controller has been automaticlly changed & my nitro botton [Space botton] is not working! plese fix it! Bring the old controls!,4

Asphalt 8,Racing,high," I agree what the other users said. This gane is such wasting time and those cars are too damn expensive. Why is it always tokens if we buy any high class cars? Also please, can they just reduce those cars into low price of tokens and credits? This is also embarrassing too. Same as asphalt nitro.",1
Asphalt 8,Racing,high," Getting money is laughably slow compared to how expensive everything is. And premium is no better, the most expensive car in the game is exactly 100 real bucks. What a joke",2
Asphalt 8,Racing,high," It is incredible!Although it is a pay-to-win game,I can really feel the excitement and the cars are really fast and cool.Moreover,the events are great and I can win a lot of exotic vehicles",5
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, Probably one of the best car games ive ever played i would definately recommend !! . Personally i think that the prices are way too high but all in all its a really great game,5
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, It's a really fun game and everything but my only suggestion is to get rid of the 'fun' from the title as it could put people off downloading as they might see the developers as obnoxious jerks,5
Asphalt 8,Racing,high, I loved this game but its very hard to get money and blueprints but i more like asphalt 9 its easy to get blueprint all of the car there are easy to get so please make this game the best add it some police chase and body kits please :D,5
