Ever since the new update came it asks me to sign into my education account, as my account is classed as a child but I do not have an education account. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app many times, and it was making no difference. My other apps, like Drive and Sheets have done nothing like this. If I log in to education with my Gmail it says the account already exists, but it won't let me access it. 16/04/2020"

BUG: April 16, 2020: Recent update keeps asking me to sign in whenever I open the Docs app. Yet, it says ""Account already exists on this device."" Very annoying and disturbs usage."
2,Scorpio Goddess,"April 29, 2020",4," It was great until the update. Now, it's okay. We never had to sign in before, so why now? When I do attempt to sign in, an ""account already exists"" message appears. Then when I try to get out, it crashes. Only when I reopen the app am I able to use it."

When I enter my email address, it says that account is already set up on my device, and it won't let me access my Docs. It was working fine last night, and apparently updated overnight. Now I have this problem as of this morning. I tried everything short of removing and restoring my account from my phone. Very unhappy user."

The web view showed the text followed by the picture with colors. The print view broke lines differently from OpenOffice, the text was displayed correctly above the image but the grayscale filter wasn't applied. Only three stars for this little experience."
5,Priyabrata Saha,"April 13, 2020",5," I'm highly impressed with this app. Such an amazing app that help me to edit my documents, like I can change the text's fonts, style or size, as well as now I can insert any image in the docs which is highly unprecedented feature for me. Glad to have the app. Thank you 😊"
6,AL ROD,"April 15, 2020",1," Good app overall, but right now it's broken. Whenever I open it, it asks me to login and when I do it, it says my account is already logged into the account. So I have to close it open it again and it stops... Until I close it again."
7,La lune,"April 25, 2020",2," It would be much convenient for us to be able to put our documents into a folder, sometimes I can't find the documents I want because the ones that are od the same topic are not in one place, even if I group them then I'll have to go to Google drive. Waste time."
8,frostwolf 123,"April 29, 2020",5, It amazing! I love it it's easy to make stories and take notes easier. You can make documents and share to your friends to edit!

Also, it seams like I have to absolutely save after I complete every single little step in creating my document/documents. ""Save It!"" After Every Single Letter.. Every Single Period! Or Else you will Loose it! Your supposed to save it as you go along anyways..But.. Not That Often!"
10,Carolyn Pettit,"April 22, 2020",4," My biggest irritation is how there is no special characters option. The only way I can put them in is if I'm writing on my phone because that's an option on my phone, not the app. So I am SOL when using my laptop."

I edit a document, saved a document and then it prints the old document before edit. I can't find anything in the instructions to fix this problem. Excellent app. Does everything I want for creating, saving, editing and printing short documents from my Android phone to my wifi-connected printer. Now reduced to two stars. When I edit a document the cursor goes from where I wanted to somewhere else. Lots of bugs."
12,Slick Perspective,"April 25, 2020",2," There is a bug. When I delete some text, usually when it's in a list, like 1 to 10, instead of deleting the text, the cursor will bring me to a random text in the document and delete that one instead.

When I delete some text, usually when it's in a list, like 1 to 10, instead of deleting the text, the cursor will bring me to a random text in the document and delete that one instead. It will also ""summon"" the text I desired to delete, to the said random location. This is happening too frequently and frustrating. I had go back to the desired location and delete again but sometimes it will happen numerous of times until I get it right. Please have this fix. Thank you."

NOT ANY MORE. The most recent update killed the app. If I could give it a zero star rating I would. It has been nothing but a nightmare especially when trying to save and share papers. Not to mention the fact that they completely re-did the writing page in a format with almost no tools or editing functions. Hate it"

I love this app and I have alot of stuff on my google account. I would love to continue using it but it's starting to get really annoying."

But it constantly jumped to different areas of the page and dragging the last 5 seconds of text with it. Causing me to spend a lot of time of time mashing the undo button. And now it's suddenly started to infinitely load and then crash while the rest of my aps work fine. So now I can't even access my work anymore.
19,Darren McLellan,"April 29, 2020",3," The app insists on saving every file to Google Drive even though I don't want it to. It also wants to save every new file before it's titled. Then it doesn't delete the empty file it made before it was named. Before you know it, you have dozens of empty .doc files lying on your Google Drive account."

I cannot access the standard menu that shows up on a normal browser. It seems like I have a basic beta version of the program. I am very frustrated because I use Docs weekly for school and I cannot add Headers appropraitely to fit APA formatting. Actually, I have to go on my desktop to set up my paper how I want and then use my laptop's version to complete it"

Can' t use spell check. Can't rename a doc being worked on. I really wish Google would focus more on it's Chromebook platform. Google sheets is equally limiting in different features. I wish all these apps worked better. But I hate apple docs and apple sheets more.

30,Steven Craig,"April 26, 2020",3, I think it's an overall solid app but it can get pretty irritating when you can't do the same things you can on the web version. I bought a galaxy tab S6 and i intend on using it like a laptop. For example: I can't change the color of tables. That is a feature I really need

Sync allows you to edit on any device. You can simply start where you left and even simultaneously edit with others. Also the spelling correction has something even paid programms cannot offer. I can seamlessly switch languages, whereas Word takes time to recognize a language switch and then marks everything after switching back to another language or fail on standalone foreign words."

It's very good with offline abilities too. Usually I have had apps crash or lag on me but this app did not do either. Quick on the go tools you can use as well as a few fonts. One small flaw and that is when I try to sometimes copy a specific section it won't let me. That has only happened to me a few time though.

Even better, you'll never lose your work - not one word - because everything is saved to the cloud. You can work locally too, but I really like the ability to move from one device to another seamlessly, working on the same document (ditto for Google Sheets). All this also means it is easy to share documents with another person (or you could even work together on it). Awesome technology!"

Unfortunately, the app can only open and functionally edit documents that are less than a certain word count. I've noticed it gets glitchy around 40,000 words. There's also less ability to format than on desktop and I've had some issues with the app crashing multiple times in succession."

The reason that this isn't getting 4 or 5 stars is one glaring issue that has been pissing me off for ages: there is no way to create actual paragraphs. The only 'tab' functionality in this app tabs an entire block of text over, and won't let one line be tabbed over. This feature has been absent for 5 YEARS. I think it is sad that google has overlooked such a simple feature."

And I don't have a phone with enough memory to keep them all in it so as soon as I clean my phone and make room all those docs jam up its memory again.
47,Otaku Lolli-pop,"April 15, 2020",4, The app is great except for when it tries to make documents available offline and takes hours to do so. It would be helpful if it asked whether or not you wanted the documents to be available offline in the first place.

That way, unless you remember the name of the doc, it takes forever to find anything, like on a desk with hundred of unsorted pieces of paper. — A scary preview of the time when algorithms determine everything, disregarding rhyme or reason. — Information from dictionaries and up-to-date grammar books never made it into algorithms, language experts were not consulted. — “Voice typing” reproduces other users’ mistakes. Ignorant of American / British English spellings (e. g. “color” — “colour”). — Replaces words / strings of words not said with frequently used ones. — Randomly capitalizes words in English, ignores all capitalization rules, especially in German. — Ignorant of German quotation marks. Omits € put in from European keyboards. — Rare punctuation marks not known. — I sometimes write an email in docs, then paste it into Thunderbird. Often I then edit it in Thunderbird. When I try to paste the new version into docs, docs simply uses the old clipboard. When I use ""paste without formating"" the new version appears. These errors have been there for years.

At the moment, the insertion of images corrupts their lower part if they should flow to the following page, there's no ability to attach descriptions to images and no cross-reference ability.

Text size (zoom level) is erratic and cannot be controlled, highlighting text keeps highlighting the wrong things, general lag when typing quickly or deleting multiple lines.

588,3RCPro-life-semper1 M,"February 7, 2020",5, I find it helpful to use when I don't have a pen nearby. I've taken notes in several documents already and think it's a good tool.

600,Matthew Currie,"January 2, 2020",2, Allow background colour behind the document to be customised. There is no contrast between the edge of the document and the canvas behind it meaning you cannot actually tell where the edge of your document is. Only requires a simple update.
601,Daddy Dog Howler,"January 10, 2020",4," I love how organized it is. It's so easy to type up a page within 20 minutes. I didnt like how it is not up to date on my phone. Other wise, this is a great source for letters or scripts."

622,Vishwanath Pandey,"February 23, 2020",4, What I want to say about the app is that it is very useful to all the users who want to write matters of their own and send to other users and media.
623,Finisher of war,"December 18, 2019",4, The app is almost perfect but when you have a document that is above 100 pages the app starts getting very annoying glitches like freezing momentarily for seconds at a time and most annoying of all when backspacing on words theres a chance it duplicates the word.

However, this being a Google product I expect a little more than basic function. I truly find the lack of an innate folder system in Google Docs frustrating and tiresome. Yes, you can make folders in their parallel product Google Drive and sort them there, but it's a horrendously convoluted experience that is not intuitive from a user experience standpoint. It took me a whole day to figure out that if I wanted to create a document that started in a folder innately (instead of being clumped together on my google drive landing age/ folder) I would have to use Google drive, select Google Docs from the right-click drop-down menu, and write away.

It's very stripped down (you can't change the background color of a table, for example) which wouldn't be a huge problem on its own, but even just the editing is really haphazard. It doesn't take much to send your cursor flying off to who knows where, leaving your text garbled and repeated and just not a fun time. It even happens offline sometimes! I do love being able to edit my docs on mobile but I really, REALLY wish it wasn't such a frustrating experience."

The Docs UI is more user friendly than Word's, which unfortunately warrants a more limited experience.

2069,Ravinath Kirindhe,"May 26, 2019",5, Google docs apps is very convenient because the files stored in there can be opened off line. Also the arrangement pattern is as to how the documents are stored is very neat. One glance and its easy to identify the documents. This is a first class app. Many thanks.
2070,ann,"December 6, 2018",5," Every apps under google are sooo amazing, simple but really really useful, the best tool for me is ""suggesting"", I shared to someone who can write it on my docs but not delete it directly, and I can choose to use it or not. Omg it is just amazing!!!!"
2071,Kellzer,"November 1, 2018",4," Haven't had any issues yet, and it's been really useful for school projects because I can access the files from all my devices. File sharing is easy and works well, and offline mode has been quite helpful on several occassions. Chill app👌"
2072,Otome Chibi,"October 10, 2018",3," It's okay I guess, though it can be annoying at times. It would be nice if you could organize stuff alphabetically/number stuff among some other things but other than that I don't really bother with this unless I have to update a document or something."
2073,Quu Quu,"December 20, 2018",5," I do love Google Docs and this app is perfect for on the go. Two features it doesn't have though is that you can't report a doc for spam, nudity exc. And that you can't share documents to the web. Only link share. Other then that great app."
2074,Kimberly Loftis,"September 22, 2018",5,"Perfect for me This is the ideal way for me to carry my work with me across multiple devices. I started using it because it is a lot lighter than Microsoft Office. My only complaint would be that, unlike Microsoft Word, it doesn't have the option to search synonyms from the right-click menu."
2075,Roben Teasdale,"January 27, 2019",4, I love being able to access docs on different devices but recently this app has been crashing for periods of time. Normally it happens when I'm try to copy or past something and then it'll crash every time I try to type. I would give it a five stars if they can fix this issue.

2077,A Google user,"December 22, 2018",5, Free. Can be stored locally and on the cloud. Saves automatically and has version history. files can easily be shared and there's multiple sharing options. What it needs now is more text editing options; stuff that the desktop version has

2084,Laila Smith,"May 27, 2019",5,It's lovely! It's great as a student in highschool I find it very useful. If I have any projects or essays I have t on complete in a short amount of time I'm able to do so in a quick manner and it's right at my finger tips. And the voice writer is also a plus!

2087,Pamela Ladner,"June 20, 2019",4," App works great but I really would like to have a ruler at the top so I can indent my paragraphs, and the function to space after paragraphs would be great too.

2089,AwesomeGirl 18661,"August 27, 2019",5," It is super useful. You can jot down a note if you are in a hurry, and look at it later. It automatically saves your new work as you write it, so you don't have to write for an hour and forget to save it at the end and lose all of it. I would recommend."
2090,BlueIsNotRandom,"September 19, 2019",5," I'd say this is one of the best apps I have ever used. Unlike word, you don't have a horde of problems signing into your Microsoft account.

2253,Lauren Marshall,"October 2, 2018",5,Love it! I have no complaints about Google docs. It literally saved my student life without it I probably wouldn't have made the dean's list twice. It's compatible with all of devices and makes my life a little less stressful.
2254,John Foster,"November 17, 2018",1," Will NOT connect, either on mobile data or WiFi. Can't load any documents when loading the app directly, and freezes when opening a Docs file from another app (Google Drive in this case), so completely useless."
2255,Mohamed Sow,"December 9, 2018",4, I think this app needs to upgrade or make an update where it can fix the grammar of your writing just like Grammarly. It should give you options of what you can put in your writing to make it better. It should also edit your sentences to make your writing elagent.
2256,Dylan Gerig,"November 14, 2018",5,"Most Excellent The app is the best thing to have if you don't have access to Microsoft Word. It is intuitive, user friendly, and versatile. And cloud storage works great"

2258,Karél Bennett,"November 26, 2018",3," This app is hard for me to use. Documents are hard to organize. Documents are placed one place, then must be moved elsewhere. I really dislike using it. However I must, as some clients use this app to share documents."
2259,A Google user,"October 24, 2018",5," You don't have to worry about saving, does it automatically. Forget Word, this is the bomb. Also it saves versions of the doc so you can revert back. Love it - and it never crashes!"

2263,Karan Sharma,"January 11, 2019",4,Useful totally. Offline widget should be there. There should be an offline widget available for every docs which we want to see on our home page/screen. Like we use to see in Microsoft's One Note. Otherwise everything is perfect.

2268,Richard Benton,"February 11, 2019",5, I use this app primarily to record my CW QSOs copied from a Morse Reader app. It is very handy to just copy and paste my conversations into a new document which I then name with date and who with. I only need to do simple editing to make things easier to read and it works well for me.
2269,Jeff Bourland,"November 28, 2018",4, It has worked well for me. I have a lot of reference and technical books in my Google books and drive syncs notes and highlights. Which makes finding and printing material easy.

2294,Sven Bliedung,"August 12, 2019",4," The only thing I miss is to create public links for documents for persons outside the gsuite domain via the app. Within the web interface it works, but in app there is no option. Also it would be great to to be able to add videos into doc from phone."
2295,Chandra Shorts,"February 23, 2019",5,"Great alternative It's a great app and very easy to use. Though I have heard horrors of the doc deleting things that are written at times due to risky nature, but it's never happened to me so I'll give it 5 stars."
2296,Austin Karren,"May 21, 2019",4, Google docs is my favorite document editor. The website version is extremely nice. The app has to be the most user friendly mobile document editor that there is. I would love to see this app gain more features from the website and eventually replace the website for chrome os devices.
2297,Annalise Wedewer,"October 15, 2018",5," This app is useful for when I have to write or do school work on the go. Honestly, it helps me with rush jobs. Many, many rush jobs, like the recent calories assignment I rushed in the airport. I'd get this app if I were you."
2298,Clumsy Ryder,"July 17, 2019",5," Honestly, this app is amazing at making stories, work, a grocery list, etc. I personally use Google Docs for my books. Now, even though most of them is scrapes, Docs made it super easy peasy. I recommend. Could use a Dark mode.. but thats just me."

2305,Tap Hongladaromp,"March 21, 2019",3," Extremely useful and handy, but still quite slow and closes itself quite often. Not very user-friendly when you need to double-click to select texts, as the app would close itself every time."

2314,Riggie,"July 12, 2019",4," This app is great for writing stories with others. Probably also good for work documents and stuff. I only gave 4 stars because there is no dark mode and its kinda hard to delete multiple files when the screen covers the delete option. Otherwise, its reliable."

2345,Xeniacal,"March 18, 2019",5, Very useful and convenient tool for writing or making project planners. Only issue I have is the lack of a Dark Theme to make writing on my phone easier at night. Would recommend as a superior writing and planning app.

2384,Charlie Meienberg,"October 24, 2018",5,Excellent (and free!) A great replacement for Word and it is free. I wish it supported password protected files but other than that it's a great choice for word processing.
2385,Cassandra Westlake,"February 11, 2019",4," Great app! I love being able to take my work with me everywhere and I love that I can save my work to my phone and edit without using data. I wish there were more formatting options, however."

2390,Victoria Morales,"October 17, 2018",5,I love Google Docs! I am in grad school and take all my notes on Google docs. My study group even has a shared Google doc where we collaborate on outlines and study guides. This is probably the best educational tool.

2392,Nyssa Peacock,"April 2, 2019",5, The best part of this app is the undo feature if i accidently delete an important document! It's really great for keeping track of things and there is a lot of options for fonts and colours. Definatly recomend this app for note keeping
2393,Lowell Bennett,"October 1, 2018",5, Powerful tool that lets you store your information online and access from any device anywhere. Also an amazing voice to text capability that makes document development and journal keeping easy.

2397,Ty Kiser,"June 6, 2019",3," I love the app, but I wish I could alter the layout so it looked like it did on the web, showing seperate pages and more features. Overall a solid, app, but I would like to see that put in at some future date."
2398,Zoe C,"June 25, 2019",5," I love this app, I always have. The setup is very simple, and similar (to that of a laptop/desktop). I love the spellcheck and the option to put into page format or not. Absolutely incredible, thankyou Google!"
2399,Tal Storm,"July 16, 2019",1, It is extremly buggy. If you make a mistake in a document and try to fix that mistake by rewriting a single part. The text will jump to random part of the document sometimes adding a random word from the document to that same place
2400,Michael Smith,"July 27, 2019",1, This app works great on the iPhone but lags too badly on large docs to be used on an Android device. Why can't Google make their app work correctly on their own operating system? Why does the iPhone version work so much smoother? This is very poor coding on Google's part.
2401,Dr N0,"August 27, 2019",4," While typing, when we tap a word on the auto-suggestion bar, a SPACE character should automatically be appended to it. This feature should also be included for normal typing (milliseconds). It will be a HUGE benefit. Thanks..."

2403,EoflaOE ViceCity,"September 2, 2019",5," This app is good, and the reason of installing this is because someone invited me to a doc. You can even see edits being done live, but the nametag won't appear until someone made a change. To remove useless ads, ROOT YOUR DEVICE, INSTALL ADAWAY, INSTALL XPOSED AND INSTALL ADBLOCKER REBORN."

2416,Braden Arends,"February 12, 2019",5, It's like Microsoft Word but you don't have to pay tons of money plus it's right in the browser and all you docs are saved in the app. Super useful it lets me do school projects without paying money for Word. 5/5
2417,A Google user,"November 1, 2018",4, Easy to use. Would be nice if included a function to alphabetize lists but much more reliable than some of the other ones I have used so I will stick with this.
2418,Tanvi Gandhi,"November 15, 2018",4,"Liked it I have used Microsoft word app but for me, that app glitches too much. I find Google docs much better. It's not perfect but better experience than Microsoft word in my opinion."
2419,CheesyTiger 105,"May 11, 2019",3," It was fine until you guys started replacing things on the mobile, like the quotation marks are just lines now. I have no idea who thought that was a good feature, but they need to be changed back."

2423,NecroWolfExPaladin,"January 4, 2019",5,"OMG Docs on the go anytime. That's about it, not going to ""type"" a novel on the mobile side. But the ease of access is still pretty great. And autosaves are a god send. Thanks Google."

2429,jin byun,"September 17, 2018",4," The one and only thing that is bad about the layout and the user interface is that it consists of large tabs that actually cover the document as you edit. Of course, everone should be using a computer for word documents in the first place."
2430,Jon Stinson,"October 28, 2018",5,Antidote to MS word Love it's simplicity. Like MS word before it got bogged down with layers and layers of features. Missing Pilcrows thou. And the lag time with typing on large docs (+2000 words) is annoying. But worth it.

2440,Sergio Del Vecchio,"May 8, 2019",5," better than Microsoft office for the price. Microsoft office is overpriced and overrated. So Google Docs may not have as many bells and whistles, but it's got great functionality across all my devices without a monthly premium."

2456,Daniel Morelli,"October 31, 2019",5, This is a great places to keep all your docs. It's feature to use it wherever and mark which ones can be edited offline is real nice too. I would definitely recommend this to others.
2457,Darla Jameson,"November 26, 2019",5, Great up. Helps productivity and great for creating forms and reports.
2458,Joseph Parnellvhr,"January 15, 2020",1, I never use it. I dont know how it got on my phone. There are so many things i wish i could trade for something else.

2460,xoxo coco,"March 17, 2020",1, Won't let me login or get it on classlink.
2461,Fatima Farhat,"April 4, 2020",4, The best app for online studying and other things but when I opened one document it said sorry for opening it because it needs update version. Please tell me how to update it. There's no update option coming.
2462,Thomas Ray,"March 11, 2019",5," I mostly use it for writing stories, and for that it's perfect. The app is a little hard to use in a few ways, one being the absence of ""tab"", but there are ways around every problem I've found yet."
2463,Weaboo City,"December 31, 2018",5, google docs is amazing! its easy to use and is available offline so it is extremely convenient. i recommend it if your looking for an app that allows you to work at home and offline anytime and anywhere!
2464,Gerardo Sierra,"April 26, 2019",4, Very useful and easy to access if you want to work on a doc on the go. A little difficult to format documents. For final formatting tailored to your specific needs you might still need to use MS Word.
2465,Emamul Hossain,"November 30, 2018",5,"Wonderful Writing App ""Google Docs is a wonderful app for writing daily notes and any kinda official documents. It's just wonderful. I wish it would be something like apple's ""pages""."

2467,WinterAquarius,"January 3, 2019",4,"Kinda hard to use on mobile I really love Google Docs, and I use it more than Microsoft Word, but it's kind of hard to use on mobile. I can't find where to change fonts, text size or anything like that."
2468,Tonya Greenidge,"April 20, 2019",1," Keeps saying I need to update then won't provide me with the option. Restarted and reinstalled still no sucess. Very unhelpful, used to work fine now I can't access 1/2 my docs on drive as tablet is saying I have to update."
2469,Andre L. Vaughn,"April 22, 2019",5, I Truly Love the Google Docs App! I'm so glad that I can write on the go and it can be stored in the cloud. It's a game changer for me and I'm sure for other's as well!
2470,Kelly Nasdeo,"May 17, 2019",5, Works just as well as Word but allows real-time editing - it's so helpful to watch live as someone edits a doc - allows collaboration without the need to be in the same place. Works seamlessly and can convert docs into Word format if needed.
2471,Devon Steel,"February 19, 2019",5, Quick and easy to use. Take note Google: the way this app deals with the top of the display great. The translucent notification bar with a little shadow over the content is way better than the solid white top on Chrome.
2472,Calamari Calamari,"March 26, 2019",2," The app quite often changes what I've typed, and does not give the option to change it back (or at the very least I cant find it). This is the exact opposite of what I want from a word processor."

EXVUSE ME GOOGLE IM TRYING TO USE YOUTUBE NOT DOCS TY NOT DOING WORK TODAY very annoying worka great offline though love using it for note taking and trying to finish a last minute project for school in the car
2477,Dominique Forest,"April 2, 2019",4," Overall great experince with app, using it with different phones, apps and tablets. Depending on device, at times will not send file attached to email is the only issue i ran into."
2478,A Google user,"March 28, 2019",4," There are things that you cannot do like a trasfer of mix data from Notepad that did not keep the same look, exact resolutions, and format. but it work well for most situations. Over all it goid enough."

2481,A Google user,"December 4, 2018",3,Ok Struggles to sync often which means the document title doesn't show and the mini page view doesn't update. Frustrating that a document opens in read only mode but it's only a click to edit so not that bad.
2482,Molly Flatley,"December 11, 2018",4,Review It works for quick memos but I tried using it for school and you can't format as much as you need to. I would use the app and then email to myself at work or the bring it up in the library to complete the formatting.
2483,A Google user,"November 25, 2018",5," I have been doing projects on Google Docs for as long as I can remember, and never had any glitch's or problems of any sort. I love this app!🖥😁👍📱"
2484,Clement P Scharff,"January 11, 2019",5,"The best way to get documents done. It works great, fantastic for collaboration. One of those killer apps you run across now and then, that you don't know how you worked without."
2485,A Google user,"May 25, 2019",5, I love docs. Before this I used Word but you could only save to that one device. For this you don't have to save and you can go on one document on more than on desktop.
2486,Emily King,"April 2, 2019",4," When I make a document available offline, I notice it doesn't always work. Usually I can access them but sometimes it will randomly not work."

2488,Muhammad Sarwar,"January 31, 2019",3, it is a good app but not the best. you can't put equations and diagrams in Google docs mobile version.being a mathematican it is very bad experience with g docs. Alternatively ms word app have a great entertainment for math works. In that sector Google needs a lot of changes.
2489,Alex Brooke,"May 9, 2019",5," perfect. does everything you need, and more. it's even better the fact you can access you docs and notes anywhere! as long as there is internet. super easy to use, always syncing. yet again, Google's got you 🤜🏾💥🤛🏼"

Literally 100% of the people i know use this app and even schools all recommend Docs. I've using for years and it's so efficient. It encouraged me with my writing and thanks to Docs, I finished so many novels"
2492,Alyssa Scharich,"October 7, 2019",3, the only issue I have with this app is that when on mobile working on a long document it gets laggy. Edit: it only shows old un-updated versions of the document making it impossible to work on things via mobile app. Please fix this.
2493,Nisha Bharatan,"August 28, 2019",3, I work on Google docs all the time. It is my go-to app for freelancing work. It was working fine till the last couple of days. It has started crashing unexpectedly and nothing helps. My work is gone. Reduced 2 stars for that.
2494,Debra Snook,"September 6, 2019",3," This app comes and goes there has been some changes that help and some that are confusing. I am senior citizen, when I get used to the last changes bang you change things again. Maybe in your help app this app could be more helpful"
2495,Rose Hill,"September 6, 2019",3," Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times, clearing the cache and etc. And a variety of other things to attempt to get docs to work on my phone (samsung galaxy s7).

2497,Shailendra Kumar,"October 18, 2019",2," This ""Google Docs"" app uses my 227MB internal storage as well as much RAM space even in background that was lagging my phone ,that's why I am uninstalling now. Developers should improve this app so that It can use minimum resources of phone."
2498,Backpacker Kerry Vondra,"October 23, 2019",5," Its helpful a lot, I do a lot of story arcs and it has just made my life whole lot easie, no need to worry about saving projects. The app automatically saves your work for you and I've never had an issue with Google docs."

2512,lucy diamond,"February 11, 2019",4," gonna give it 5 stars if there's a dark mode (both app and browser) also, your browser version's toolbars could really use some revamp as it takes a huge chunk of the screen, which is kinda inconvenient for laptop users."
2513,Everjoi 3,"April 4, 2019",2, This is a very useful app. However I cannot add an account and every time I try to do so the app crashes. I have tried to report this issue however I still haven't recieved a reply.
2514,Alvaro Mascarenhas,"April 9, 2019",4, Very efficient to use. It supports different document formats. The app supports offline too. You do need internet connection to sync though.
2515,A Google user,"October 24, 2018",4," Overall very good. Doesn't work quite like MS Word (you can't apply headings for example). Typing is good. But it takes a LONG while to load longer files, and I mean VERY LONG."
2516,Rebekah Meyers,"February 11, 2019",5,Easy to use I feel like I'm on my laptop typing things up even when I'm on my phone doing it on the app. It's easy to use and everything syncs well between both of my devices.
2517,Joel Mancillas,"April 30, 2019",4, great for viewing and editing documents on the go. However I think the mobile app could use the ability to edit mathematical expressions. On the go.

2524,p k,"May 22, 2019",1, Cannot type for very long. Cursor keeps changing places on its own. Now I am getting spam ads everyday through this app. Why am I getting so many dating ads from people I don't know? How did they get my email? I have only used this to write essays for school. Mobile app is junk!
2525,Elias Salomao,"November 2, 2018",5, It's a wonderful app. I just think it should have more font options and a way to adjust the page. Adjust how far the script will be from the edge.
2526,Don Brooksby,"October 8, 2018",5,"What an App! I've been using the Google Docs app since it was available and it is fast, takes way much less resources than the competition, and it is written by Google. No brainer! A 5-star app, hands down!"
2527,Cameron Richardson,"March 17, 2019",5,"The Gold standard Google Docs has radically shifted how I do business, take notes and manage a team. The phone app is really as good as it gets."
2528,Rawnie Adhikari,"December 24, 2018",4, Its great overall. you dont get premium MS Word features. But it has enough features to be used on the go on a small screen. It would be great if you guys could add the feature of user created templates
2529,Leah Knopp,"December 13, 2018",5, It's really great for writing whatever you want. I love how it saves everything you write down and you don't have to worry about having to write everything all over again! I really recommend this app!
2530,A Google user,"November 19, 2018",5, Google docs is just so helpful. Me and my friends can all work together on school projects or even just fun little activities. I hope that other people find the app just as good and useful as I did.

Well after that i got a little leary about updating my appts and up until this day still am.
2533,Ben Mudge,"June 21, 2019",4," obviously not as good as a pc version but a close second best, very handy in a pinch or when on the move and being able to do the bulk of typing on the go then switching to a laptop to finish & format is a real help."

2535,tatum rosete,"September 15, 2019",3, Does almost everything google docs does normally. Might I suggest somehow building in a function that helps me use it with chromecast to cast my document in full screen on a tv? I hope to turn my phone into a workstation of itself. Thankers.
2536,Yong Shi,"September 17, 2019",2, I used this app on my iPhone for 5 years never had a single issue. Change to Android phone now the app some time can't be opened. Showing editor at another device. There's no another device.
2537,Ofonime Udookon,"September 24, 2019",1, Would like to change this rating if I see an improvement. Tried to open a document today five times and the app crashed all five time. Don't understand why this is happening since I am using an Android device. Google please fix this.
2538,QiQi ZMART,"October 25, 2019",4, I'm a writer and loves to write on the go. This app even give me the option to write offline and later auto sync with all devices when internet is back online.

2539,Osama Sarm,"October 26, 2019",1," I find it insulting that you cannot open a doc on your own phone without connecting to the internet. Useless app with so many daily updates yet still very broken, copying-pasting something have never been this difficult. You guys should feel proud having achieved this level of incompetence."
2540,Devesh Soni,"October 26, 2019",5, I would give it five stars! It is much better than Word and has great fonts. The developers have done hard work. Although it is good but I think it CAN HAVE an image cropping system as it sometimes comes in handy.
2541,Sandra Lighthouse,"November 5, 2019",5," Its great for making notes, quickly make documents and many other things too! Thank you Google!"

2695,A Google user,"October 20, 2018",3, True printing million labels .... dam near imposible to get a template that works. Every one points me to Avery but you can't remove the title line so nothing fits ... you would think that label template would be a natural inclusion.
2696,Haley Lockmiller,"February 20, 2019",5, I love being able to access my documents on the go. I've been using this app for years and it has been extremely useful throughout high school. There's really nothing I can't do on this app that I can do on a computer. Excellent!

2701,Arliss Moffett,"April 27, 2019",3, The opening screen that shows you the names of the docs is bulky. I don't think there is a need for showing what's in the docs it's too small to see anyway. just show the names of the docs

2715,Ankit Chandak,"January 6, 2019",3, Issue: PDF download has very different spacing and indentation than normal print view inspite of keeping the page size as A4 which results in unexpected page breaks or increase in number of pages. Rest is good.
2716,Ashley Rae,"June 2, 2019",1, I find it completely ridiculous that we have to download these apps when we already have Drive pre-downloaded to our phones without the option to delete it. Not only is it a complete waste of space but it is also very inconvenient if you have to go to wifi to download them.
2717,gail raguindin,"June 20, 2019",3, Almost loving it. The only issue is that it only has limited feature in mobile version. Try to make it more like the google docs used in PC and i'll give you 5⭐.

2720,Leonie Hunt,"September 9, 2019",3,Crashing I think this app is just ok. My major problem why I don't always use my internet connection with it is because the app crashes too much and this tends to piss me off because I have important things in this app and when I need to use it it crashes.

2724,Libby Carey,"October 29, 2019",5, It's very good in the respect that you can write whatever you want on liads of different templates. I personally use it for writing stories and I find jt very useful - better than Microsoft Word or pen and paper.

I feel insignificant, like a piece of dust, flying in a desert wind, a droplet in the rain, a cloud in a hurricane. It feels robotic, emotionless, it brings no comfort, only service.
