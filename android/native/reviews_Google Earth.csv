I use it to explore areas that I vacation in, before and after. It helps in deciding when and where I'm going to spend my time. And no more getting lost when following directions from locals..... Before Google Earth I was a map freak. I would plot literally every mile, every gas stop, rest stop, etc. And I could predict my miles to travel by the markings on the map."
1,James Holmberg,"April 11, 2020",5," Google Earth is BY FAR my most frequently used app. I've been known to spend hours at a time on there.

Between exploring ""new world's"" by soaring above like an eagle or zooming in and seeing my car in the driveway, or revisiting old haunts to see how they've changed, it more than maps. It often has emotions and feelings attached. Then when I thought it couldn't get better...3D model excites a whole nother dimension...literally"

Only suggestion: OPTIONAL TOPOGRAPHY, above & below sea level. Although, in 3D model, you can see depth: with topographic lines, you could tell the exact altitude. Regardless, everyone on Earth should have easy access to Google Earth. (Btw, the fact that it's only rated 4.3, shows a tragic lack of intelligence or curiosity among users. )"
3,Tonya Maddox,"April 21, 2020",3, I love Google Earth but there is way too many botchy areas and no street view for roads that are clearly roads. Also what is up with blurred and blacked out spots?

Also what is up with blurred and blacked out spots? I've found several roads that I wanted to get street view and i couldn't even get close to the rd. Sometimes id have to go way out from the area like miles before im able if at all to get a street view. I love to search for abandoned places and beautiful places and discover strange things so get on it Google and get more street views.

I can spend hours scrolling through this stuff and learning things and even some humorous and frightening things. Make sure you have a good internet connection if you go browsing in this app. User friendly UI and usually kid safe.
5,guatemalantomcat,"April 13, 2020",5, I play a lot of city building games and ever since I have developed an obsession for city street layouts and what not. I am now addicted to Google Earth. It's truly amazing what Google has accomplished with this app/software. Will keep awaiting for more cities around the globe to be added.

Mostly, I use it for seeing the appearance of houses I am going to for blind pick up and deliveries for local sales sites on Facebook.

9,Anonymous,"April 23, 2020",1," This app used to be awesome! Literally awesome! But now it takes like a 100 years for a street to load, if you zoom into a country then you have to wait at least 5-10 minutes for it to load... Fix it please! And then our Stars will go up and up and up!!"

13,Casey Bowles,"April 16, 2020",4, Wish this app would update more often. Most of the imagery that is on here is 5 or more years old. There are roads that are new that aren't on it. Even roads that are no longer there. I do love the app though. Just wish it was more up to date.
14,Trevor Dawson,"April 30, 2020",5," I use this app all the time to find new places to hike, and map out routes that I will take. I also use it to measure distances and explore new places. Definitely one of my favorite apps, have been using it for years."

17,Bryan Harmeyer,"April 8, 2020",1, Downloaded and uninstalled on several occasions in the last few years. Goes fine and then just stops and sends you back to your home screen. Thought maybe it was the device but I have installed it on several devices and the result is always the same. For all its hype it's a crappy app
18,muhammed kolade,"April 20, 2020",5," Its really good in terms of describing exact locations of places, buildings...therefore changes in the places should also be uploaded back to satellite servers as early as possible, as it is not providing live event...its really useful. Comes in handy."

Finally we have Automatic Tracking of your Location which have been missed so long and which will save you a lot of trouble during tracing your way out in the wild, vast cities or your adventure.

1294,A Google user,"January 26, 2019",3," it is a great concept and one of the best ever thought of, however, the app keeps locking up and crashing Everytime (for me anyway). i hate it cause i use the app a lot therefore it crashes a lot. idk what else can i say."
1295,Akshay Bhat,"March 17, 2019",4, The app is good but some places are not updated. some places doesn't look clear and it should be updated when zooming and this map is useful for the tourists who used to roam around the cities or counties.
1296,A Google user,"October 7, 2018",2," I kinda liked it but I noticed something, the time line is from the past and not from today, like it is never gonna change, I saw my house and it is not like the present, it's still from the past but it is still useful"
1297,Jesse,"April 28, 2019",1, App is great when it works. However it has been closing immediately upon opening for the past couple months. Have installed the latest version without success. Update: Nothing to update. the app is still not working...
1298,Marshall Spoon,"March 13, 2019",3," clear, crisp images with moderate to quick load speed. the only draw back i see is that you can't search maps over time and that would be my main reason for using it. otherwise I'd just use Google maps."
1299,Dead Man,"February 26, 2019",5," Very useful, although pictures may not be up to date, I used this to get a good look at my home before drawing it for a school project. I only had 2 problems, the second being that it took a minute before anything wasn't blurred out."

1302,Sarah Jo,"August 18, 2019",1," I used to love Google Earth. I downloaded it for my pixel and it wont even load. So I thought it must be my phone, so I tried again with my samsung tablet and....it still wont load. Just the image of earth and an ever lasting round blue ""thinking"" circle. Really disappointed!"
1303,Jessica Young,"October 22, 2019",5," It was a quicker way to see the world. Its also just something you can play with real quick. My favorite thing about it, is being able to know what things look like, its like im goin there, but not for reals! I can even see my 🏠"

The clarity sucks, and the zoom in feature doesn't even work completely except where they want you to zoom. They have purposely downgraded the quality in efforts to keep anyone from researching.. Just goes to show how corrupt Google is... I know they can do better, i have physically seen it, satellite imagery is 1mil times better than what you get with this ""questionable"" app. But hey 🤫 watch for the ""google washout tag"""

1309,Sharon Anne,"September 29, 2018",3," This could be a great app, if it didn't freeze and crash Android after a few minutes of use. It does the same thing on my Lenovo tablet and Huawei phone so I'm fairly sure it's the app and not my device."
1310,Colin Carroll,"March 13, 2019",1," This app keeps crashing and closing on Samsung Galaxy S7 phone. I use it daily for work and this is the 1st time its done this. Ive sent feedback with no response. I have the most recent updates and have uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing works."

1313,Sanjeev,"October 25, 2018",1," Maps on Google Earth has been outdated for over 1.5 years now. Repeatedly been sending feedback to update maps during this period but with zero response. Might as well kill the map. As a result, Google Maps also remains outdated in the area we live."

1315,A Google user,"March 11, 2019",1," Hey Google, did you get too big for your britches and ghost your fan base?

1317,Damon,"May 24, 2019",4, very amazing satellite view 1 problem though. it won't let me see from street view on some roads even if they aren't private it's okay I guess. I deleted it though because I never really look up anything on it. good app you should get it. :)
1318,laura O,"May 30, 2019",3," The app is amazing. I can be anywhere on earth in a minute. I can see the Amazon River, or Big Ben, Paris. WOW. However, the app is a little difficult to use, but its well worth the effort."

1320,Israel Onomine,"September 12, 2019",5," Previous versions icons would appear on home screen for easy access. I recently updated this app, but surprisingly, the icon was no where to be found. Ive tried several times to no avail. Please correct this anomaly. All the same, this app is superb!"

1332,Damon Oleskewicz,"November 24, 2018",3," I would rate this five stars, but this keeps kicking me off! I am using an old device so that may be the cause. So it's probably not Google's fault. Overall this is a good app accept for that."
1333,Neil Hawkins,"March 12, 2019",5, Loads up and works with no problems for me. Having read the most recent reviews I would suggest to those having problems uninstall it and download it from scratch.
1334,Layne Chavez,"April 14, 2019",5, is it made my life so much easier because climbing steps is very difficult for me and I'm able to check out the location beforehand to make the appropriate accommodations. The team who made this app - you guys rock!!

1351,A Google user,"November 6, 2018",5, I think it would be great for a teacher to show there students were places are. Also its great because let's say you wish to travel somewhere and it's really far from were you are you can use the map to find your way.
1352,Andrea Schmidt,"April 15, 2019",3," Good but kicks me out after a few minutes. Wish the picture was clearer when zooming in. Not in real time. However, it's still cool to venture to other countries without a passport."

1387,kelly9 love,"March 30, 2019",5, It is a really good app. What I like most about it is that you can go inside the houses or places and see the inside so it makes it really awesome and gives you the best experience ever if you want to go to a place and you don't have the money to go.
1388,Lord EchiOsiris,"November 16, 2018",1, These images are over a year old and are not updated to current imagery at all. Yes you can see great in city areas but country areas you cannot clear image to see. If you updated your imagery I would give this 5 stars. Your app program is not sufficient

1625,keith trott,"August 19, 2019",1, full signal on 4G and yet still won't fully load on any view. absolutely useless now. I'm convinced that app developers are in competition with each other to see who can wreck it best. Total rubbish!
1626,A Google user,"August 21, 2019",4," Great for street-level viewing. Just wish there were more blue highlighted ones to pick from. I have a lot of places I'd like to see, but can't see them with street-view, only 2D."
