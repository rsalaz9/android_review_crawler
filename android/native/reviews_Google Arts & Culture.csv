It's a fantastic idea, but it quite simply doesn't work. At all. I can't use it, all I get it ""There is an error loading the page. Tap to refresh."" It's utterly mindboggling just how inept you people at Google are, everything you do is abysmal, you screw up everything you touch."
1,Robin Thompson,"April 26, 2020",3," Love the idea, not the execution. Getting lots of errors when trying to load the app, and when trying to do virtual tours of museums.

Getting lots of errors when trying to load the app, and when trying to do virtual tours of museums. Perhaps they're not available in my region? I'm not sure, the app doesn't really tell you. If the issues could be fixed, this could be a really neat app for people stuck in social isolation."
2,Sarang,"April 24, 2020",5, It's an immensely important source for those who don't have access to artistic creations confined to some museums. It's like democratization of art. UI/UX is still evolving. But whatever is available is very convincing that it's on very interesting journey. Thanks.
3,Gary Thompson,"April 24, 2020",1," Nice, cultured app but latest build (7.7.4) still doesn't work (S8 running Android 9). App loads but produces ""there is an error loading the page"".

""Tap to refresh"" just produces the same page (under heading arts & culture page / heading). Other reviews report the same issue. Rolling back to v7.4.5 returns expected functionality."
4,Samuel Cantrell,"April 12, 2020",2," Keeps trying to load and says page content not found. If you keep trying, you can eventually get a camera button at the bottom of the app, which, if you tap fast enough, at least lets you try the ""convert picture into classic art"" feature. But it appears most of the app is broken."
5,Lameisha Blue,"April 24, 2020",2, Great photos of art work i love the selfie feature that finds artwork that looks like you..its a little off but very interesting and cool.BUT I dont think it has every painting and sculpture ever and the search engine is not accurate i wish my phone was compatible with the other features.
6,Arash Zamani,"April 15, 2020",1," After recent updates the app always shows a message that the contents can't be loaded and it is offline. Before these damn updates, I used to spend a lot of time by checking this great app and dive through the world of art. Please fix it!"
7,Sridhar Raman,"April 17, 2020",1," It keeps saying ""TAP TO REFRESH"", but nothing happens. There is literally no other page/tab/screen. What is the problem? Is this app geo-restricted? I am trying this in the UK."
8,Jorge D Aguiar M,"April 7, 2020",1," I wanted to use the option to convert your pictures into art, but since you can not frame the image, you only get the part the app wants to. Just not ideal."
9,Nick Byroglou,"April 29, 2020",5," An excellent, educational, generous application. I just wish more applications like Google Arts & Culture. Creativity and inspiring challenge inside. Thank you"
10,Gabriel Skiver,"April 14, 2020",1," This app has never loaded past a white screen with a blue circle in the center. There is no menu, controls or indication that anything is loading or processing. My device is a galaxy s9+."
11,james marlow,"April 18, 2020",5," This app isn't just about finding which portrait you look like, it's so much more. Really worth having a good look at."
12,Beauford A. Stenberg,"April 15, 2020",5," Five stars for the functionality alone, let alone the collections and institutional breadth. I came across this app on my magical SmartTV which was once upon a time anything but FRIGgin' smart. Thankyou to all concerned. bhagavanSKYFlower B-)"
13,Becky van Paassen,"April 15, 2020",5," Such a great app! Especially since all the museums are closed at the moment, a great way to see art up close."
14,Ila Unava,"April 16, 2020",1, This is broken. Briefly shows a UI and then switches to a page 'content not found'. What the heck Google? This is a Pixel 3 on latest OS patch.
15,James Koppert,"April 29, 2020",5, This is a revolution in arts and culture. This app takes high brow and delivers it to the masses in fun and accessible ways. I am so impressed with it
16,John Schneiter,"April 23, 2020",1, I installed it and it worked fine. The next day.. it will not load. Same thing on a Tablet. I changed nothing.
17,Blue Berry horror,"April 13, 2020",1," Downloaded this app to use the selfie to match with art that looked like me but it wouldnt work, i could pull up the camera and everything, but when i took a picture the app would either crash or just not take a picture at all."
18,Joanne Widjaya,"April 21, 2020",5, For me this app was the coolest thing ever made. Thank you so much google. Im really enjoy my leisure time at home during covid to use this.

20,rakesh juneja,"April 10, 2020",4," Overall very good app, but would appreciate if it could also have details of world's leading art institutes, colleges where one can study."
21,Jessica Seal,"April 15, 2020",4, I absolutely love this app the only reason for four stars instead of 5 is because I have not finished evaluating it for a fair & proper review.
22,Ronald Ribulotta,"April 17, 2020",1," Poorly done, glitches, slow. Not worthy of even 1 star or any more words of rating."
23,Randy Batista Rodriguez,"April 9, 2020",4," Could you please update with Dark Mode theme as an option of the app interface? The white splash of the screen whilst the app is opening is so frustrating, and also bad for our eyes. Please, an option to select themes: -System default -Light theme -Dark theme Thanks and regards."
24,BrandonF,"April 9, 2020",5, Very very cool app that's also educational no matter your age or intellect. Everyone should at least download & take it for a spin. Well worth a few minutes or hours of your time.
25,Burak Oskay,"April 12, 2020",1, Not working. Says there's an error loading the page when I open the app.

30,Peter Parker,"April 26, 2020",5, Love this app. I hope more art style will be added.
31,Chuck Gasaway,"April 5, 2020",1, Sounds like a great app... But all I see is a white screen with a blue circle. At least it's consistent - same on both a tab S2 /Android 7 wallpaper and S9 /Android 10.
32,Sam W,"April 5, 2020",1, Doesn't work. Just get an error saying it can't load content. It'd be pretty cool if Google ever had stuff that just worked. Maybe if they have more resources...
33,Paul,"April 6, 2020",1," I only see a blue circle on a white background. Nothing more despite waiting minutes, and no notification if this is due to some background loading process."

Tried the art selfie and all it did was take a photo then stall for several minutes with dots on the photo, then it said take another photo (with the first one still on the screen so it was hard to line up correctly). Just a loop. Lighting and background changes didn't help. Uninstalled. Seems like a good app if you can get it to work."
57,Cristy Venceil,"March 12, 2020",5," Love this app! I was not expecting to honestly. The imagery is stunning.

63,Rolli,"March 28, 2020",5," Very cool. Here's just a small glitch with zooming out of images where it doesn't zoom out all the way so the UI goes mad doesn't appear again unless you go back and then back onto the image. But otherwise, very cool"
64,Natalie Daly,"March 16, 2020",2," Great idea and would LOVE to explore, but the street view feature (click to explore) doesn't work at all, and this was the only reason I downloaded the app at all"

70,Louis Aurig,"February 24, 2020",1," I can't open the app. Reinstalled multiple times, and it isn't opening. Everytime I open the app it only shows me a white screen with a blue doughnut shape in the middle of the screen."

85,Joel Petrow,"December 8, 2019",5," Utterly fantastic. This app and its desktop counterpart should be shouted by every educator. Anyone with any interest in man's creative accomplishments is wise to regularly explore the works Google has collected and presented in stunning ways. Thanks, Google."

112,Ticking Green,"April 22, 2020",1, Why does this app need to remind that I am using google arts and culture app. The banner goes and comes again everytime I zoom in. If you really want me to know I'm using your app atleast make the banner static. And why are sculptures not viewable 360¬∞?

I want to have headings like artist, subject, movement, medium etc not basically be advertised on trend subject matter. I was looking for some art works pertinent to black British history such as the painting of Dido Belle or The Slave Ship by Turner and couldn't find either of these works but I don't know if that's because they aren't on the app or not. Art and culture should be presented clearly. This reinforces an American world view in my opinion."

I just red an article today about this app. Apparently to load the Vermeer site, you have to take your cell phone camera and wave it in a circle on table. You need a well lit area and something that has texture on it to scan. I did this repeatedly- perhaps ten times. I finally got it to open the AR Vermeer studio, but it cancelled out and I had to start over again. No thanks. Google shouldn't release an app that is so buggy."

I see people leaving 1 star because they couldn't find the Art Selfie feature, which is literally on the main screen when you open the app. The level of detail you can see what in almost all paintings and other art pieces is just mind blowing, I've never had any slowness or freezing issues, Art Selfie works great, information about museums, paintings, artists, etc is really helpful and educational. Front page is constantly displaying new items, so even if you're getting the app only for the selfie feature you might accidentally learn something."

219,Jelani Burrell,"September 27, 2018",5, I love how it works with my chromecast and passively exposes myself to art and culture that I'd otherwise might not be able to experience. This app is dope!
220,Ramil Huseynov,"September 26, 2019",4," Very great app. But why there is no download for saving articles and reading them offline. There is a section called ""Downloads"" but grayed out."

231,Tluangboihi Ralte,"November 1, 2019",5, I'm so glad this app exists. For a broke student who can't afford to travel around the world it gives me a chance to find inspiration from history and art. This is just perfect for an art geek (*ÀòÔ∏∂Àò*).ÔΩ°*‚ô°

I did find Katya Medvedeva's ""mothehood"" and my life is better for it. The app could use more responsive buttons, getting out of a page takes lots of pressing as oppose to 1 back to home button. The AR is amazing, you can almost touch the paintings."

250,Phuong Vo,"January 14, 2019",5, Can't believe I've never heard about this app until recent. What a useful app for artist to learn and study from. I found the augmented reality feature more pleasant to use than zooming with my fingers.

UPDATE Nov 2018: I received a very nice message from Google. They explained that the app has been updated for international use. I reinstalled the app. It crashes every time I open it. üòñüòñüòñ"
1755,Jim Cullen,"December 9, 2018",3," EDIT: Region lock removed. The app itself is pretty nice, although the information given about paintings seems a little lacking. Don't feel I've learnt much. ORIGINAL: Region locking a feature that clearly is not about licensing restrictions is unacceptable."
1756,Julie Duenes,"December 10, 2018",5," I wanted to try out the selfie feature but I don't have it on mine, because of the location restriction??? That's really dumb. It's a cool app but that was something I was wanting to try out. Please fix that.."
1757,Barcs G,"November 29, 2018",4," It's a novel enough little thing (though it seems like it's content to just match you with anyone who's got a beard, haha).   Old Review: Why region lock a feature that just requires a photo, it makes no sense."

1761,Ekaterina Ryjkova,"December 4, 2018",5, It's very frustrating that the selfie feature is region locked as a lot of people downloaded the app just for that. Very stupid decision making
1762,S G,"December 3, 2018",5, EDIT: Selfie feature is global! and it works! *** Don't bother if you're looking to use the selfie feature. It seems to be region locked to select unspecified u.s. locations only. Installed and immediately uninstalled.

This is especially true if you are a busy person which I am. I have had just enough time to pop this app and look around a few times. But I like what I see. I hope to go deeper into it in the future but I've seen enough to suggest this is a rare example of what I always thought the net should be. Not thumbs up and thumbs down or mean hearted videos.

I'm sure they have a good reason, it would be nice if they said that so people don't spend so much time looking for it. It is sad that all the brains at Google did not think it was a good idea to keep people informed about the app and region specific functionality."

2743,Marianne G,"January 15, 2018",2," It should have a 5 star rating, but because apparently I am not in a ""select location"" (Chicago metro), I don't get portrait matching.  When Google explains the logic of regional restrictions I will consider raising my rating."
2744,A Google user,"March 9, 2018",5," My absolute favorite! Amazing content! This app is my personal source of inspiration. Love it so much! Despite the fact that I downloaded it because of finding doppelganger thing, it was totally worth it."
2745,A Google user,"January 22, 2018",4, Well like most of the people here i downloaded this app for that doppelganger thingy which doesn't even work in my region. I simply faked my gps and Internet location to San Francisco and it worked like a charm ^^
2746,Dani Ellett,"January 17, 2018",1, Would give it zero stars if I could. Keeps crashing when I use the selfie portion and redownloaded it just to see if that was the problem. Pretty sad.
2747,Jordan Oh,"January 14, 2018",1," If you're Canadian and looking to use the 'Is Your Portrait in a Museum' feature, don't bother....the feature is not there. Why make a feature available to some and not all?! So many regions are excluded that the feature should have never even been advertised. Exclusionary app, check."
2748,Gurban Jalil,"January 19, 2018",4," Cool app. Folks who complain about region restrictions, please note that it has nothing to do with Google. There are local laws which prevent them from enabling the selfie functionality. It's a legal matter."

2756,A Google user,"January 15, 2018",2," It stops out of nowhere a lot, I can't use it properly because of this. The region thing makes no sense. The app would be really amazing if it wouldn't crash so often."

2758,6utthole,"January 16, 2018",1," I was also disappointed by region-based restrictions. It's sad, because it seems fun and now that it's trending, many people want to try it out themselves, but in the end it's just nor available for them."
2759,Ryan Thompson,"January 15, 2018",1," So buggy, to the point that it's no annoying I won't use. Screen freezes. App doesn't respond to commands. One would think Google would have app-making down by now but apparently not."

2761,Patamery Higginbotham,"January 16, 2018",3," Overall it's a pretty cool app. Can't seem to get the doppelganger feature to work, it opens and allows me to take a selfie but freezes immediately after the picture is taken."

2773,Kimberly Strait,"January 19, 2018",5, I love that I have access to all of this delightful art.  I would love to use the face-finder but unavailability in my area doesn't take away from the point of the app.  Thumbs up!

2844,Ben Edwards,"January 14, 2018",3," The face match is fun, but the app is slow and it lacks some of my favorite paintings.  The Treachery of Images by Rene Magritte being my favorite work and not in the database."

What nothing on the app tells you is it appears only available in America. So after spending 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back looking for it, finally searching information online would appear can't use it in the UK.   Thought Google would not have had to use these sort of techniques to get people to download an app, that to be fair is ok if your into art and culture, that doesn't have the key feature promoted. Maybe instead of counting the number downloads it should remove the count of those uninstalled on the same day to give you a true reflection of how popular something is.   I downloaded, I evaluated, I Uninstalled"
2848,Travis Anthony,"January 18, 2018",2," I mean, the app simply takes a face and finds a art piece, that also has a face on it. The idea is fun but its not very good. Shhhh they're listening"

It's weird because I live in the heart of Sydney and yet it's still restricted here. It looks like a great app otherwise but I'm hoping all the bad reviews will make you change the app for everyone, especially now that it's viral. Then I'll change my review."
2850,Logan Stowell,"January 19, 2018",1, Came here looking for the popular selfie option. Turns out it was poorly communicated and isn't available in most regions. I spent 30 minutes navigating the application only to find it isn't available. Poorly communicated.
2851,Hannah Kemp,"January 19, 2018",1, I wanted to find my doppelganger but couldn't because of my location. Don't offer a service if only certain people can use it. I would recommend fixing that.
2852,Kim Arauz,"January 14, 2018",2," I like that I view artworks from a variety of artists and some favorites but I was also looking forward the selfie element that I have seen friends and family do but for some reason, the app on my phone doesn't offer it."

The portrait-matching thing is fun, of course, but there's way more in the app for exploring museums, learning about pieces (there are thousands upon thousands catalogued in the app), and generally enjoying and learning about art. However its super buggy. Pages on pieces lock up all the tine, keeping you from reading them. The whole app occasionally freezes up. The museum street-view can be difficult to navigate and doesn't seem to have integration with viewing pieces' pages. And as many people have said, it seems to have some region-lock issues (which, in their defense, is forgivable given how hard it can be to show items internationally without running into copyright/IP issues). So yeah, great concept, but subpar execution. Hopefully its popularity will mean it gets worked on/fixed/updated fairly quickly."
2857,Tommy Tab,"January 16, 2018",1," Museums are great, but why us this viral selfie thing not available to everyone? I just wasted 5 minutes."
2858,Matt Bates,"January 17, 2018",1, You are aware people are only downloading this because of the 'who do you look like' feature. Not being available for all means a quick uninstall.

2861,Efigie T,"January 17, 2018",1," Exactly as with everyone below. It's nice and useful app, but I would never have downloaded without seeing all the hype about the feature, which only now after download, I realize is (undefined) region restricted."
2862,Allan LEONARD,"January 15, 2018",3," Content is excellent. Frustrated by inability (yet undiscovered) how to mark or follow favourite artists or stories. And the lack of the selfie feature, ""Is your portrait in a museum"" in the UK region of this app. Room for improvement."
2863,Amber Rausch,"January 17, 2018",1, I don't know why you'd region lock a feature on your app. Just so people will download it and be disappointed? That makes no sense. And its going to kill your rating.

The app is fantastic and thank you for the hard work. There is one small suggestion I would like to have you. The grey header is not cool. It's very big and bright and it feels disturbing to me while I'm trying to dive into the image mentally.  If you could make a full screen mode or just wait at least 10 second before the ugly grey brightness falls down. Or make it transparent and leave the arrows to represent the cold grey colour. But it's up to you. I'm just talking from the art lover perspective. My phone is a Razer Phone. Best wishes for 2018

If we dont have it in Canada my assumption is now its not anywhere but the United States?...

2946,Brandon Lorance,"January 16, 2018",1," Making a key feature, being the only reason I downloaded the app, unavailable to people in certain Regions is so beyond stupid that I don't know how that would even come up when creating the feature"

The doppelganger feature let's me get to the ""take a selfie"" phase before it doesn't go any further. Thought I was in the ""good to go"" part of the US. Perhaps not. Will get a higher rating if it doesn't freeze anymore"

It refuses to work for me, I take the picture and then it stays on that screen without ever doing anything, it doesn't respond to anything unless I close the app completely. I've left it before to see if it just needed time but when my phone would power off to save battery life, the photo would be gone when I'd bring it back on again. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail, checked for updates but nothing. It's frustrating because I really wanted to play with that feature. Everything else about the app is great, I love being able to look at artworks by colour and exploring different artists across time and cultures. Just disappointed I can't play with that one feature."
2961,Hal Hall,"January 18, 2018",1, Like others have said I can't find the subapp to compare my mug to art. Had lots of trouble finding this main app in the store. It's well hidden.

2966,Jen Bryan,"January 16, 2018",2, I actually love the app but I can't do the selfie thing. I live down the road from folks that can. It seems arbitrary and I'm sad.
2967,Matt Thrush,"January 20, 2018",1, Very hard to use.  Was looking for the art doppelganger to see what I looked nearest to and couldn't find it anywhere.  I would look to something else before ever thinking of this again.

That's disappointing, especially since I figure we have more art museums than Iowa. I'm not a huge art fan, so I don't know if I will bother keeping the app. I will say, however, that it does look as though it would be a great app for art lovers."

It's like the app designer is saying a share button, a like button, a search button and reminding me of the name of the app I'm using and what company made it is worth 5% (or however much vertical screen space the bar takes up) of a Van Gogh painting.   Just let me look at paintings in peace, if I want to like or share it, it's okay, I can tap the back button once. I spend way more time looking than using the nav bar."

If I were to judge this app would have become the best app of the year.   An immense amount of ground work is being observed in each article and every pallette.   The thing is that this app is not crappy and does not put up useless stories just for reader's attention.  Every article has its own importance and are truly great. It totally invokes every intricate detail and observes all philosophical histories and their aspects of epistemology.   Had a wonderful time using this app and will spend a lot more of it further .
5187,A Google user,"November 17, 2017",4, It's a great app but and would definitely give five stars if a read/view later was added for articles and works because I don't like adding everything to my favorites. Would be cool if we could make our own categories to put work in.
5188,Bill Buniga,"September 24, 2017",5," This app is incredible. I was pleasantly surprised at the sheer amount of content and information available.

Thinking it meant being able to view various museum pieces 360 degrees but so far it seems to be just google street view, too awkward for 360„Çúanyway. Navigation is messy,  searching brings up new pages which are cluttered and dont necessarily bring up what is asked. Try typing 'mona lisa' to expect a view of the real thing? Other searches, ditto.

But the app's ability to share is disappointing to say the least.  You can share to Google+ but the photo that Google+ receives is relatively small.  The problem is you have to open a browser in order to upload the picture. If you try to share the work of art to Tumblr using Tumblr as the browser, the share page comes on and goes right off.  You can't use the Acer Float browser at all.  If you use Chrome to share with Tumblr, you must sign in with Tumblr which doesn't recognize your password or email and wants you to open a new account with them.  (5.1 Lollipop, Acer tablet)."
