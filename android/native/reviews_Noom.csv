It's a very intelligent plan, different than others I have tried. I have heard it compared to weight watchers, and it is similar in that you can eat anything in moderation. However, where noom improves on the ww plan is the different categories they put your food in. Therefore you can't eat zero point food all day in order to save up for a 16 point piece of cake before bed. Recommend!"

Not even an email was sent but yes they can prompt you via SMS if you haven't logged in for some time (the logic!). Also, the way to unsubscribe is not clearly stated (you have to send a request via the messaging function). And apparently, it's stated on their website that they wont refund subscription fees!! Got a shock when i checked my credit card bill and have sent in a refund request."

It's my first week and I already lost weight but more importantly, I'm developing better habits. Initially, I did not hold out much hope because I have tried just about everything program out there. This one is different. There is a big focus on mindset. Mindset is everything. It's the make or break in weightloss. Noom is on to something."

They make it near impossible to delete your subscription and you can only do so via the chat bubble with your coach. This also shows how it's an automated system using a bot for your ""coach""! They will charge you without notification once your trial ends. Please be weary there is a reason you can't manage your subscription with them via Google. I'm almost positive they won't give refunds for this lack of ethical practice."

I unfortunately cant afford the monthly membership and have to quit after the 2 weeks are up. Fortunately, those 2 weeks were awesome and very good at habit building. AND noom doesnt fully force a bunch of New Age occultic stuff like most health and fitness sites do, it has a teeny tiny bit, but not enough to be a huge concern. Much appreciated."

Is it a trend to not include the subscription function in the apps right now?"

I only use PayPal for stuff like this. If I could contact someone directly to figure this out I would definitely give this app five stars . HELP

Would have stayed with them if the app worked better."
15,Didi Foster,"April 23, 2020",5," This really works for me. It's sensible and doable. I did WW but they changed their point system and it didn't work for me anymore. With this app, I log my calories, but I can eat the food I want in moderation. Also, there is a lot of support with a coach and a group. It's a great app."

18,Alysson Dyer,"April 25, 2020",4," This totally works! The app is super easy to use & as a diet IT'S WORKING! Granted, it's the end of my first but so far so good! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is b/c the food tracking. There should be more measures for serving sizes...other than that...4.5!"

I liked the ease of the program, the information is good though not news, it fits easily into the day. Use an outside pedometer. The recipes are pretty good too. My coach was not super helpful, but ok. It's not a bad program."

It is behavior adjustment and you get great information about nutrition and other ""psych"" tricks to get a grip on food addiction.

Just keep in mind they will charge you around $40 a month after the 2 week trial for premium version (there may be a free version). Well worth it in my opinion, as their daily articles help build healthy habits and curb unhealthy ones. Highly recommend."

32,Megan Peacocke,"April 25, 2020",3," I really have loved using Noom. The only thing I didnt love was the length of the articles you have to read each day. It says it'll only 10 minutes, but it often takes longer. This made it feel a little overwhelming to me, and discouraged me to stick with it daily."

36,danny vocal,"April 21, 2020",5," Very helpful because it addresses the psychological issues involved in losing weight: motivation, setting goals, better understanding how high water foods can better reduce calories and hunger if increased, and there are motivating pages to read each day, including a live coach."
37,Daneil Kacer,"April 23, 2020",5," It's completely different from every diet out there as it's not a diet. It's teaching me how to eat right on my own, while making nothing off limits. I have my own coach, and a support group going through the same things as me. The lessons every day are great, and the color system is very helpful."

40,Courtney Manire,"April 24, 2020",5," The Coaches are very helpful, and the plan is designed to help you build a sustainable lifestyle not just lose weight. You learn not just about food, but why you eat the foods you eat. And how you can continue to eat yummy food while maintaining a healthy lifestyle!"
41,Marion Doane-Smith,"April 24, 2020",5," I have been using the Noom app for eight weeks now and have lost 10 lbs. I like how the foods are put into Green, Yellow and Red catagorys so you know how much of each group you should have to balance your diet. There is also a coach and a group to help me along the way on my diet journey."
42,Hannah Joy,"April 23, 2020",5," I love this app. I've never felt so free, successful, and healthy on an eating plan. I've been a faithful Noomer for 6 weeks, which is about 3x my normal ability to stick with a ""diet."" I absolutely recommend this app."

The knowledge it gives you to help stay on track is great too. I love the witty nature of these lessons! Excellent app, you won't be disappointed."
45,Cynthia Lovold,"April 24, 2020",4, This is a really great tool for changing habits & eating healthy. I'd give it 5 stars if I could mute the British guy interrupting my workout every literal 20 seconds to tell me how far I've gone & interrupting my music. Otherwise it's great!
46,CYNTHIA HICKS PADILLA,"April 24, 2020",5, I love this program! It is more than just weight loss. I love the psychology aspect of it and it has been super helpful for me!!! It has been almost a month. I still love it and I have lost 8 pounds so far! Thank you Noom!!

50,Randi Lovett,"April 25, 2020",5, This is an amazing program! Logging your food takes the same daily dicipline as a workout would and it really makes you see the effects of what you put in your body! And you arent alone - there is 100% support the whole way!

52,Stefan Nikolovski,"April 22, 2020",4," Noom is a great program coaching you through behaviour change and a healthy lifestyle. It's not just a weight-loss app although I'm loosing a lot of weight!

54,Carol Hunter,"April 24, 2020",5, Fun and easy . There are lots of great motivational tips. The quick recipes help me ward off the cravings. I have been on many diets over the years but I have never seen anything quite like this. I would really recommend this app.
55,Jessica Verdin,"April 24, 2020",5," This app uses actual science to help you loose weight. I have so far lost 15lbs in 4weeks. It is not like other restriction diets, it just teaches you how to eat in sencible ways. I can still have cake and pizza and loose weight."
56,Karah Scott,"April 21, 2020",4, Love the content of noom and all the help it offers. Only issue I have is with food logging as it keeps saying database needs to finish downloading and it had been 3 days and 2 reinstalls. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.

The first thing that I feel led to failure for me were the restrictions by the end of the second month I craved what I had given up. Second thing for me was I didn't realize how much I was over eating. I new what I was eating wasn't the best choice but when you put into perspective it wasn't so much the quantities of food as it was caloric.

They then try to flog you meal and diet plans as extra. I have a look at my email which says I signed up for a 4month plan and will be charged full amount if don't cancel during trial within the 2 weeks. This is not mentioned at any time when signing up! Underhanded con artists! Deleted the app after 10mins as it's the same info you get anywhere. Waste of money!!!
60,David Slattery,"April 22, 2020",5," The app is good, however the inbuilt pedometer did not work well on my phone. My testing showed it only recorded about ⅓ of steps. Switching it to use the Google Fit pedometer gave much better results."
61,t r,"April 24, 2020",5," When first signing up for noom, I felt like I was in the dark from their commercials. Not really knowing what to expect. Give yourself a full day the day you sign up so you can get used to the app. It's great- now that I know how to navigate it."
62,karen White,"April 23, 2020",5," Easy to use, lots of great information! It's a different approach to eating well and staying healthy! The interaction is great....helpful but not intrusive!"

64,Sam Caldwell,"April 21, 2020",5," Very intuitive and thoughtful. Friendly accountability prompts and reminders. Invest yourself in it. These COVID days, ""Zoom"" and ""Noom"" are at the center of all my screens. The rest of the time I'm walking!"
65,Leah Otto,"April 19, 2020",4, Love the tracking of food and exercise. The coaches and daily articles are helpful. The group is fun and supportive. Have to give only 4 stars because my goals are only logged in saved articles making them difficult to look back to.
66,John Lachner,"April 21, 2020",5, Great program. Goes into the science and psychology of weight loss and sustainability of a healthy lifestyle. Only thing I would like to see improvement on is finding particular food items while logging.
67,Norma Walker,"April 21, 2020",5, I really enjoy using this program. It has really given me a new outlook on what I eat. Makes me think more about my choices and why I want to eat certain things. My weight loss has stalled right now but better here than 10 pounds heavier!
68,Helen Pronger,"April 24, 2020",4, Really enjoy the different tracking that comes with the app. The only issue is that the pedometer doesn't seem to count all the steps.
69,Laura Cragun,"April 20, 2020",5, I was thrilled to get a 14 day trial. It has really blown my mind how well the plan is put together. It really is motivating for me I love checking boxes and being reminded. Overall the best plan out there.

79,Jim Giblin,"April 24, 2020",5, Good program. Easy to follow and actually fun. It's a whole program of education and you learn to control your portions by understanding the caloric content of your food.

That being said, this app is not for me. It's too expensive: $150 for six months after your two week trial (which you still pay for), compared to $80 for a year of Fabulous. The deal breaker is that it doesn't sync with another step counter, so you have to constantly have your phone on you. My Fit says 9815, but Noom says 276. Very discouraging."

They have recipes and places to log exercise. I feel like it is a reasonable price for such an important part of life that many people struggle with. I lost 6 pounds in the first week and it was not so bad. You learn to weigh in every day and log your food every day. They also teach you how to eat more healthy. Eating some sweets is ok so it is not an extreme diet.

If cooking your own meals is encouraged there should be a better way to add ingredients from your own recipe or one online that you can type in or out the URL in like My fitness pal does. Also the activity or exercise logging has too many and too frequent verbal ques that is not easy to turn off if at all so it keeps interupting your music. But I like Noom it works!

It's not possible to log my own recipes, so instead I have to guess or try to log every individual ingredient divided by the number of servings the recipe is divided into. That takes way too long if there are a lot of ingredients. I like the color system for keeping track of how I distribute my daily eating, but wish I could check it without ""closing"" the meal."

I have not subscribed for the premium service. There are a couple of glitches. The most distressing one is that the step counter does not work. Today I walked playing 9 holes at a local golf course.

301,Andrew Mason,"April 15, 2020",3," Great program, really been helpful. However, the app appears prone to freezing and crashing, especially when used with mobile data, and it doesn't count steps very well. Most days I can manage between 8k and 10k steps, but the app will only register an average of 2k on such days."
302,Christi Brown,"April 16, 2020",4, Finally found a food plan that works! Had a few issues in the beginning but customer service was on top of it. Only 4 stars bc you can't build your own recipe in the app. So it can be hard to log some foods if you don't already have the nutrition details. Overall would say this is a good app/plan.

The daily lessons are very important to understand the psychological triggers of your brain and they provide tools to reprogram your food choices.

Its a kickstart that I needed as I generally have lost weight before in the past (about 43lbs), but gained some of it back over the past 3 years due to stress -- so this was the perfect thing to remind myself how I on my first weight loss/getting healthier and stronger journey. I took a star off because of several things: 1️⃣) Subscription management is pretty frustrating. There is absolutely no option to manage or cancel your subscription within the app. Then when I went to Noom's marketing website, there wasn't even a login button - there's no way to login from there on web. THEN I had to literally Google ""Noom login"", which directed me to a different website in which I should've been able to login. I say ""should've"" because login on there doesn't work, or at least in my case it didn't. I signed up using a Google account, which was not supported on the web. THEN I had to Google how to manage/cancel my subscription. But from there, I found their FAQ section on account management and to my annoyance, it said: ""To cancel your subscription or trial, you will need to send a message to your Goal Specialist. To get in touch with them, please tap on the chat bubble icon in the top right corner of the Noom app home screen:"" ...Yeah, its quite the pain. 😑 I already paid the $99 at this point for 2 months, but I really hate it when companies don't make it easy for you to unsubscribe, and I KNOW I will really feel bad if I got charged again in 2 months by forgetting to cancel. 2️⃣) No multi-selecting on food items when logging in the food log - its more time-consuming than I'd like since you have to find every food item one-by-one and flipping through more screens than necessary. 3️⃣) Inputting the quantity of food (e.g. 300 calories, 240ml, etc) takes a long time since you can't directly input numbers and instead have to scroll through the number wheel element. 4️⃣) Goal Specialist is nice but sometimes the responses sound superrr copy-pasted. I sometimes can't tell if they are actually responding to me based on actually reading my responses vs. having their chat triggered to respond based on some of my keywords. I get it, they probably have a lot of people to manage at a time but I was hoping for a more personal conversation instead of more often than not, asking me for one-worded answers. ✅That asides, I mainly wanted to keep the app for at least a couple months because I found that going through their articles is entertaining. Having the daily 5-8 quick articles to go through per day keeps me engaged and more aware of my weight loss journey. The writers of those articles are great - its fun reading through them and its full of pretty funny puns."

After eight weeks, I have learned how to pace myself. Some of the psych tricks are useful; most don't work for me, but that's just me. Long story short it's like any other weight-loss program: you must commit if you want success."

The data base is huge so most bar codes are easily scanned and you can log food in a variety of units. I can only give 4 stars though because I think they need a vegan filter. Although they have plant based recipes they still show me animal protein in my food searches.

It's frustrating that the only place I can access a service that's so expensive is via my smartphone. For the amount I paid they should have a web option, or at the very least, a better system for synchronizing my data between multiple downloads of the app. I'd love to use the phone on the go, a browser on my computer, and my tablet on the couch, but that's not an option. That's forgivable for a 99 cent app, but inexcusable given Noom's price tag."

Noom, however, is so much more. It's about building a lifestyle that is about a healthy balance. Not just that, this app makes me chuckle & I actively look forward to what it's going to say each day. It has a nerdy sense of humor that would appeal to anyone who doesn't live under a rock aged 20-60. So great. Impactful. Fun."

There are other apps that do that, but Noom also provides a Goal Coach and an online group to connect with and share struggles and victories.

They teach you how to understand your eating and work at making the changes to maintain the weight loss. Been on the app for 4 weeks and have lost 16 lbs. Best of all I'm viewing what I eat differently. No food is off limits, but limit when and how much is the plan. I can have cake, but maybe once a week."

Would like it to be a little cheaper.

I have learn tips and tricks for changing my lifestyle. I also like that the ""psychology"" part of it is presented slowly over time. The cons are the step counter does not work for me but I discovered my Samsung Health app and just adjust my Noom app steps from that. Sometimes you have to add your own nutritional info. for a meal item, if you make a recipe."

The best is the psychology to attain and maintain weight-loss. In often times amusing ways they teach goal setting zones nutrition zones motivation and accountability.

Especially to those who need a new outlook on their weightloss journey."

566,David Belliston,"March 30, 2020",4, Great app with a lot of useful advice. The cost is pricey but you get a great amount of resources. My only other criticism is the pedometer is spot-on one day and way off on others. I would use another pedometer and adjust the steps.
567,Travis Mattocks,"April 2, 2020",3," The tracking for your meals is good. The pedometer doesn't really work. Definitely has good information in the lessons. My problem was with the coach. I would get a message in the morning, respond to it, and not receive a response until the next morning."

At least I rarely heard from mine. They contacted me to ""try to make it right"", but all they did was offer me a discount. That's nice, but what this app seems to really be about is getting you to pay for them to hook you up with other people paying to create a support system. There are better food and exercise tracking apps. I'd be happy to pay what they're asking for coaching, not to be connected to other people in need of coaching."

610,Russell Creed,"April 3, 2020",5," Noom is easy to use, entertaining, and engaging. It gives you simple tasks to do each day that build upon each other. Those simple tasks turn in to big changes. In addition, it connects you with a real life coach to help you on your journey."
611,Andrea Olieslager,"April 7, 2020",5," Awesome app that gets into the psychology part of your health and wellbeing. Easy to use, friendly chats, great quizzes to really get to know yourself and best of all they really do help you understand your eating habits and assist with eating better."

The app is informative and the support helpful. I appreciate the nudge toward healthier food choices and the psychological approach toward success.

And im a stay at home mom so anything that talks about work is not relatable to me. I'd rather use a free app to track my food and weight.

704,Paula Redmond,"March 15, 2020",4, I find most of the aspects of this app useful but there are a couple of changes I would like to see: 1. That the daily calorie intake is adjusted for exercising achieved. 2. That there are more food options for different countries - many are American brands which are not in other countries.

The only way to back out of paying the $130 after the free trial is to contact your coach who only talks to you once a week or so.

710,Ingell,"April 1, 2020",5, I am loving this app. It definitely helps with accountability and just knowing there is always support there to help if needed. Being a part if a virtual group is also great because I know there are others like me with some of the same struggles.
711,Sione Lynch,"April 2, 2020",5," Noom is very easy. No videos to watch just prompts to nicely encourage you to log meals, weigh , exercise etc.. Uncomplicated and fast.

714,Connie Otto,"April 3, 2020",5, I like being accountable for food and weigh ins. Good articles of new ideas or things I knew but hadn't thought about in a while. Be nice if there was some way to see list of food color choices without logging food first. Good app though!
715,Dawn French,"April 7, 2020",5," This app is legit if you want to loose weight it goes so far above ""dieting"" and gets to why we do what we do & how to change our habits all in very positive ways.

716,Bukola Olaniyi-Tayo,"April 8, 2020",5, Great app! Offers a more holistic approach to weight loss and fitness. Noom addresses the physiological issues of weight loss in realistic way and the humour helps. Instructions are simplified and broken into achievable daily / small action points. And it works!

They provide tips and advice to help you modify your eating habbits for the better. I don't feel deprived of anything, as the skills and tips help you want to replace high calorie foods with lower calorie foods. You become a member of a large group and it helps ALLOT to hear from others and share your stuggles and successes. Only negative I see is the app is a bit slow."

It's worth it!"
761,Kelsey Washington,"February 24, 2020",4," The only thing holding me back from a 5 star review is the slow response from your coach. It can take a couple days to hear back from them, which can be frustrating when you're having a bad day. Otherwise, I love the daily check ins and quizzes and tips.

763,Marjie Russo,"March 1, 2020",4, I like the articles. They're informative and funny. The pedometer is a little frustrating. I don't think it keeps up with my steps but it does give me a basic idea of how many steps I have. Food logging is super easy. Overall it's helping me stay on track with my weight loss goals.
764,Zina Bennett,"March 2, 2020",5," I still see fluctuations in my weight, but my clothes are fitting differently. The thing with my weight is that when I get enough sleep I weigh less.

774,Lori Robichaud,"April 1, 2020",5, Love it! Easy to use. It helps you be mindful of what and how you eat so you can change you habits. Change can be stressful but Noom keeps it light with a sense of humor. Love the positive reinforcement!

779,Sue Fink,"February 11, 2020",5," Very helpful and fun! Good jokes in the lessons. Very good information about how to choose the food we eat. Makes you you think through what your going to eat. Great areas to track exercise, food, recipes, etc. I am so pleased with the app."

I have tried so many diet plans and always quit because I'm miserable. Noom has changed the way I think about food. It had taught me so much about the way my brain has been trained wrong and helped me figure out why I eat the way I do. I've lost 17lbs in 4 weeks and I am happy and satisfied. Please do yourself a favor. Try it!
822,Abi Browning,"March 18, 2020",5," Easy to use and very helpful, a really different experience for helping to lose weight and in keen to keep at it. Friendly reminders and fits into my day. The app has been well made, a few tweaks to make logging food and listed recipes or meals easier and it would be perfect!"
823,Ashley Talbot,"March 22, 2020",1, They make it extremely difficult and confusing to end your trial period and they will charge you for the expensive subscription without you knowing. You will think that you ended your subscription when in fact you haven't and they will not refund you. It sucks :/
824,Pearl Christie,"March 24, 2020",5," It's like having a person fitness coach next to you at your service. It's unlike any weight loss program I have tried. It restructures the way you think about food and exercise. The app celebrates the small winning results that yield very successful outcomes. Thanks, Noom!!"

In a short amount of time. I got sucked into Noom by one of the ads I saw on TV. Tried everything else, why not. Super glad I did. Been using 5 weeks, down 15lbs. At a weight I haven't seen in over a decade. No gimmicks, no food or supplements to buy. Just a great understanding of the mental aspects to weight loss. I'm a super fan and would highly recommend if you have battle the yo-yo diets in the past."
826,Israel Ortiz,"April 1, 2020",5, Awesome way of holding me accountable on a daily basis. The tracking of the food and caloric density count is extremely helpful in making better food choices. I highly recommend it and wished I could afford it to keep going.
827,Betsy Taube,"April 6, 2020",5," So fun!!! I've been doing a trial period for a week and I'm hooked. I already lost about 3 pounds but the app is what makes this great. Very easy, very interesting, and very encouraging. Try it!"
828,Alicia Wales,"April 3, 2020",5," Long-term outcomes with real lifestyle changes that YOU decide. Not just another ""quick weightloss...gain it all back in few months"" diet. Makes you more aware of food choices and habits and offers suggestions based on RESEARCH (they actually name their sources, which is awesome!)"
829,Mikenna Greenough,"April 12, 2020",4, I've been doing this about a week and it's a great way to actually learn about what you're doing a d how to make healthy habits to make it stick. Theres tons of trackers out there but this one teaches you why certain foods are better.
830,Shelby Wakefield,"April 13, 2020",2," I love the program so far but I have a lot of issues with the app, it's been slow and it crashes I've done my best to work with it but I can't even appreciate the curriculum when it's hard to use the app. I use zte r2 phone on Android ver. 9"
831,Carroll Morgan,"April 15, 2020",5," I Love this NOOM program, it's the first time I have stayed with a weight loss program for more than a couple of weeks. I've learned so much about myself and why and how to eat properly. Getting there slowly, BUT I'm getting there and enjoying it."
832,Mary Mendelsohn,"April 14, 2020",5, I like this program alot. Good tips n tricks and ways to keep you on track to changing habits. Easy to read the lessons and process them. If your not fully committed to changing lifestyle and relationship with food it's not for you... yet. When your ready I definitely reccomend.
833,William Dzurick,"April 19, 2020",5, This program is changing my relationship with food and eating. It is very well thought out an easy to use. I highly recommend this app.
834,Lynnea Atlas-Ingebretson,"April 22, 2020",4, Like the app it works but one thing to help me feel included would be having people from diverse backgrounds reflected in their illustrations and stories they share. I have been on for weeks and haven't seen any diversity.
835,Tiffany Ghigliotti,"April 24, 2020",5, Best app for weight lost. It's not a diet app. It's lifestyle changing app.

It's basically a virtual interactive support system that teaches you all about why we eat the way we do and how to gradually change your habits and behaviours and adopt new healthier ones. I am unable to attend a slimming club due to my shifts, so this is proving to be the perfect alternative for me and the weight is coming off in a steady and maintainable way. Would definitely recommend."
837,alex mcleod,"February 2, 2020",4, I have found this very helpful. I am emotional eater so the psychological triggers of eating explained here are very helpful. Give it a go! I give it 4 stars cos I think that the coach I have been given is not good but everything else is brilliant and really working for me.
838,Carolyn King,"February 2, 2020",4, It has been really quite educational and easy to follow. Online support network with other Noomers has been great also. My only downer is it doesnt accept Samsung watch as one of the apps so I have to manually add my steps each day as I don't carry my phone on me all day.
839,Massimo Nastasi,"February 6, 2020",4," This app is amazing and very complete. I give 4 star because i would like to see some customization like lunch and diner time and the pedometer voice (really robotic, and cold), The goal specialist is something totally different from others app, and really a must have. Keep forward!"

When I started the 14 day trail, I thought, this is not going to make that much of a difference. So, to be honest I went into it half-heartedly. I couldn't wait until the 14 days was up so I could cancel and say ""here again I spent money for nothing"". I was my own worst enemy. By day 8, I was sold. I saw the difference and I tell anyone that will listen about Noom. Thank you,"
841,J B,"February 10, 2020",4, Really like the app overall. Except the pedometer stopped working 6 weeks into the program. I use it within the app. Not hooked up to any external devices. I also wish the app let you plan your calories the day before. That would be helpful.
842,Melissa Howard,"February 17, 2020",5," So happy this far with noom, I have lost weight every single day, when my pedometer wasn't working correctly they helped me get it fixed. When I needed more help with my active work life and how to stay eating healthy throughout the day my coach provided me with recipes to be able to assist."
843,Ruben Trevino,"February 12, 2020",5," I have seen a significant amount of changes in this program. I did the usuals, even starving myself! This actually is great for me to understand physc wise to learn how to get it together. If you're having to struggle with the weight management, do this!"
844,Valarie,"February 15, 2020",5, Noom is easy to use. The coaches provide great support as well as the interaction with other users. Daily articles and helpful tips are essential for me. Logging food and keeping within the recommended guidelines is easy and achievable. Love it!
845,Debra Bryan,"February 13, 2020",5," So easy to use, and dare I say it fun! I'm learning so much about how to make healthier choices and how to stay on track. Noom really helps you understand your habits and works with you in a practical realistic way. It's completely changed how I look at my habits."
846,Taylor Meyers,"February 20, 2020",2," I love the program! But, since the newest update, the pedometer isn't working. I have it connected to Google Fit but the steps don't sync. I tried manually updating my step count, but it doesn't save. Once this is fixed it's a 5 star app!"
847,Donna,"February 23, 2020",5," Having a coach has been great as well as logging food and seeing how many calories I've used and have remaining. I'm only just starting the second week, but find I'm excited, which has never happened while following a dietary program in the past."
848,Cheryl Scriven,"February 23, 2020",4, Really good app and the daily articles kept me engaged. I am losing weight. I don't really feel that the group or mentor helped me that much. Maybe it's me - I find it difficult to relate to them as real people when I only talk about one topic with them.
849,Ali G,"February 28, 2020",1," Although I cancelled Noom months ago they continue to charge me. Upon calling customer service their advice again this month? ""Install the app and cancel it like that."" It hasn't worked in the past so why will it work again this month? This advice and their ""customer service"" is a joke!"
850,Ruth Mandato,"March 9, 2020",5, I have just completed week 1. I successfully tracked my food and exercise. Your app is the best I have ever used. This app is very user friendly. It only takes me about 10 minutes for training and tracking. I specially like the bar code scanner. I cannot wait to to see the results.

853,Honda Gwynn,"March 24, 2020",3," I like the program, but there are a few things in the app that aren't so user friendly, like not being able to create a recipe in the Android app, not being able to create favorites, and the syncing of devices like Samsung Health for activity needs work."
854,Jenna Allen,"March 26, 2020",5," Great app, it keeps me focused and thinking about goals. It's very positive and personalized, I love the psychology that abounds within. I love that pretty much everything I want or need to track is in this one very easy app. It's very convenient."

856,Amanda Spencer,"April 3, 2020",5, I can't compare Noom with other weight loss plans because I've never used one but Noom has been great for my body and my mind. It works for me! It helps me understand what I've NOT been thinking about food choices. So far I'm down 16 lbs!!!
857,Tiffany Garcia,"April 13, 2020",4, Love the program. Its easier to follow and i dont get mad or feel resentful like previous diet programs because it explains WHY. The app has a few things that seem clunky (group chat and member to member chats) but overall i am so glad i signed up!
858,Serena Rasmussen,"April 15, 2020",5," Tracking my food is a real eye opener. The articles are a quick read yet full of support and encouragement. I get to chose what I want to eat, and with a little planning I never feel hungry or deprived."
859,Shelbi Allen,"April 20, 2020",5, Love this system. Not just an app. Real people help guide me along the way. I can really keep to things when the science and psychology support it. Noom makes sense in a way that sticks and motivates. Just do it.
860,Victoria Catlett,"April 20, 2020",5," Been at it for a week! The app works wonderfully, though I wish you could copy meals from earlier days because sometimes I eat the exact same stuff! But I like the program and the app is very helpful."

863,Jack Wineman Salseda,"February 12, 2020",5, Just completed week one and I really like it so far. Very intuitive app and easy to use. I'm also enjoying the writing style of all the information that is provided. Basic facts with some comic relief. Good stuff..... I'm excited to see my results.

865,Araceli De La Barcena,"February 11, 2020",4, I love the app and the concept and all the support. I would like the opportunity to save meals and re-use them at later dates. Other apps like my fitness pal and weight watchers have that capability and I think it would be ready enough to implement.
866,Casey Darling-Horan,"February 17, 2020",4," I like this app. The amount of information can be overwhelming at times, but I can go back to review most info if I want to re-read. I liked the low-pressure approach. It was difficult for me to transition to tracking what I ate, but the program is really supportive."
867,Mark Esser,"February 29, 2020",5," Boom hasn't only helped me to lose weight within my first month of use, Boom is helping me change the way I think about food and eating.

875,Happy go Misty- Finding Joy in the Everyday,"March 28, 2020",5," Loving this program. If you mess up on your health journey, it's an opportunity to restart each day, and it gets into the psychology of why you return to this cycle and how to break it. THIS is what I've been looking for."

883,Judy Richardson,"April 4, 2020",5, Noom is amazing. Incorporating the science behind the recommendations is so insightful. The coaches help you to set regular goals and work towards them. And they online support group really helps. I've lost 15.6 pounds in 11 weeks.

890,Ilario Amato,"February 8, 2020",2, The app does not say you have to read extensively every day all its tasks. It is good only for those patient enough in spending half an hour every day. Of course their statistics work great because they do not consider all those that dropped out before. For me £10 wasted
891,Juliana Suarez,"February 8, 2020",5," I love the everyday tasks and the step counts. You can also log your workouts, blood pressure and glucose level.

893,don morris,"February 10, 2020",5, Starting week 7 and I've lost 20 lb. I think my favorite parts of the No om app are the calorie budget and meal logging.

895,Seleah O'Connor,"February 21, 2020",5," My coach is super helpful, the articles are short, to the point, encouraging and informative, and the other features of the app, like the food log are very useful. It's much easier to use this than to try and keep up with everything myself."

898,Valerie Hanrahan,"March 29, 2020",5," Noom is a great program. It not only helps you lose weight naturally but, they make it fun to learn about what makes you eat more and how to control hunger. Support group is a plus to share with others how you are doing and what your challenges have been."
899,Janet Smith,"March 28, 2020",4, the whole time I have been using the app the pedometer has not worked accurately. A big part of the tool. I keep being told they are trying to fix. But a large part of data and history isn't accurate.
900,heidi green,"April 11, 2020",5," Love this program! -This does go with a subscription - it may have a free version I'm not sure - but, I am loving what i am learning and it is helping to motivate and educate me on my weight loss journey."
901,Linda Allen,"April 15, 2020",5, I am really appreciative of Noom during the current public health crisis. Noom curriculum developers and coaches have worked hard to understand and support participants during this crisis. The curriculum and support is exactly what I've needed!
902,Monkey Fusion,"April 19, 2020",5, This is a supportive and very helpful app with real interactions with a coach to help achieve health and fitness goals physically and mentally. Its a subscription service I plan to pay for that can replace or compliment a gym experience.
903,Sheryl Chittick,"April 17, 2020",4," Your food log could use a bit of work. I make alot of my own food, and frequently have to just pick a brand eqivilant because thére is no choice for fresh veggies or home made balsamic dressing and i dont know enough about an item to add the info to the database."
904,Matt Wellman,"April 20, 2020",5," I started Noom after considering weight watchers for several months. So far the articles have been fun, the coaches have been supportive, and it really helps you be aware of what you're eating."
905,mike meyers,"April 21, 2020",5," Very easy, intuitive site. Very satisfied so far!"
906,Jennifer Dye Visscher,"April 23, 2020",4, If you follow the calorie guide you will lose weight! The information and support are helpful. I've lost 10lbs in my first month! Only thing I wish it had was a recipe converter.
907,Jeff Easley,"February 1, 2020",4, This app is user friendly and convenient. Logging food is the easiest of any app I have used so far. The integrated messaging and group chat features make conferring with you group really easy. This has been a great companion and tool in my weight loss effort.
908,Super D,"February 4, 2020",4, Interesting advice and tips along with explanations of how we work psychologically and emotionally. Utilizes daily lessons to convey information. Also includes virtual coaching and communicating with other group members. Very supportive way to lose weight and live healthier.
909,Brian Thomson,"February 5, 2020",1, Seems like a great app for people who want some encouragement to stick with a weight loss plan BUT they have a shady automatic renewal business model. I paid for a trial and was surprised to find an additional $125 charge on my PayPal account a few weeks later.
910,Judy Betzold,"March 14, 2020",5," I'm a month and a half into the program. I've lost 10 pounds. I really like this program. Every day they teach you something about your hormones, body, mind, stressors, etc. that plays a part in losing or gaining weight. I'm happy with the program and will continue."
911,Laura Weaver,"February 10, 2020",1, No easy way to cancel subscription. Plenty of instructions and none match what appears on my screens. They say to tell your coach and I haven't had a coach contact me since last May. I read on the Internet that some had to change credit cards to get the charges to stop.
912,Jayleen Couture,"February 10, 2020",1, Save your dollar! Outrageous fee. They'll tell you the crazy fee after you give them your dollar.

Sure will lose weight because you'll have less money for food. Didn't look at anything on their app after seeing that fee. Just considered it a $1 donation.
913,Rana Hariz,"February 16, 2020",5," The application and the coaching itself is life transforming, and I can see how it changes the perception of dieting. I would only recommend to add the Samsung watch under devices as I need to enter my pedometer manually everyday, which I keep on forgetting every now and then."
914,esther pochakilo,"February 15, 2020",4, The program is structured differently than most and gives more freedom of choices. It is more time consuming than projected but it does keep you thinking about your health all day long. You can be very interactive via their social media if desired.
915,Saundra Feusse,"February 19, 2020",5, This app has been very helpful in my weight loss journey. It is user-friendly and easily syncs with my Fitbit. The daily helps are keeping me on track. I am subscribing to Noom monthly and do not have to deal with annoying ads.
916,C Dn,"February 15, 2020",5, The help with coaches and information is amazing. There is always someone there is a boost of confidence is needed or a question needs answered. I have been doing very well with this app and will stick with them. DEFINITELY worth checking out.
917,Dwayne Price,"February 24, 2020",5," I've struggled with weight loss for years. This program really works for me. And it's not that hard (for me, anyway). So far I've been on the program for 1 month and I'm down 9 lbs and I'm feeling better, looking slimmer and eating healthier. I highly recommend Noom."
918,Dorothy Norlen,"February 26, 2020",5," It's a great program, hoping to permanently adopt the healthy eating habits & use all the wonderful tips given to us everyday. Weight loss for me has been slow, but if I continue to eat healthy the numbers on the scale will go down."
919,Joey Fredericks,"February 27, 2020",5, Noom has made it very easy for me to track my meals. The app is so easy to use and tracking calories makes so much sense! I am at the start of my journey but after one week feel this is a program I can stick with and have even lost a few pounds.
920,Lawrence Palmer,"February 26, 2020",5," It's very informative and have learned a lot of good things about nutrition and habits, also makes you feel like you're not alone.I like logging my meals because it makes us more aware of just what and how much we are eating ,I would definitely recommend this"
921,Heather Leslie,"March 3, 2020",1," Can't log in. Constant message that my phone doesn't have an internet connection. It does. Rebooted phone. Uninstalled/reinstalled app. Same error. If I can't log in, I can't seem to cancel the trial. Suggestions? Update 2 days later: zero response from Noom."
922,Christian Bartholomew,"March 1, 2020",5," Noom is like no other ""diet plan"" out there. It truly puts a whole new perspective on your eating habits and lifestyle choices that affect your weight and health. First time i have felt confident that the changes and effort i am making are going to be worth it and long lasting."
923,Keren Walker,"March 7, 2020",3," I love the psychology and such that come with this app. It has helped me to make some changes.

You record your meals and it tells you how many calories you have eaten and then how many you have left for the rest of the day. Virtual tutors also contact you if you need further help. You can also go back and revise previous items. A very clever app. I'm having good weight loss too! 😊"
925,Megan Baughman,"March 11, 2020",2, I think it could be great. But the app is inconsistent with what it tells you is a green food and what it actually says when you track it. You can't input a recipe on androind so i guess you just guess how much of certain foods your getting in a serving. And pretty sure my coah is a bot.
926,Richard Hamrick,"March 15, 2020",5," I'm having a very good experience using the Noom app. As of the end of my 4th week today, I have lost 10 lbs. The weight loss (2.5 lbs per week) has not been linear. It is irregular. That implies an improvement in metabolism too."

928,Amy Anderson,"March 28, 2020",5," I've only been on this app for a week, but I am learning SO much and can see my calorie intake decreasing while still feeling satisfied! I'm optimistic for some new lifestyle patterns to help me stay healthy long-term!"
929,Nadja Toothaker,"April 3, 2020",5, I love this program! Its helped me change the way I think about food and has helped me see how many calories I was really eating! I get a goal specialist to help me set & reach my goals and a group. Starting week 5 now & am down 13lbs!
930,Mandi Garcia,"April 11, 2020",4," Pretty good app. Doesn't have ability to enter recipes so that is annoying. The group part us fun. Individual coach, in my experience, was nothing to tout. Very rarely messaged and when she did not really worth it."
931,Shubha Dasmahapatra,"April 15, 2020",1," Pathetic app. Totally wrong on what it claims .I opted for trial period in which there was no support as such...also,today they deducted around INR 10K for a program.I want to get in touch with the tram and get the deduction reversed."
932,sarah peterson,"April 20, 2020",5, loving it so far. it is the most fun and interact way to log your food. The articles and format are really keeping my motivated.....keeps me accountable and on track without feeling like it takes up to much time

935,Kathy Warren,"April 25, 2020",5, I love the information provided and the reminders for tracking.
936,James Davis,"February 22, 2020",5," I have lost 5 pounds in the first week. I really like the reminders to log meals, and the tips that are helpful. Now down 10 pounds after 4 weeks! After 6 weeks I am down 15 pounds, 2 notches on my belt, and I can feel the energy increasing!"

Noom is such a cool app, you learn so much as you go and the weight just comes off if you stick to your plans. I know now why I was getting big and how to prevent it in the future. No drastic, crazy changes in my diet, no extreme exercising. They teach you what you need to know about what you're putting into your body and a lot of other awesome stuff along the way. Give it a try, it'll be worth it."
938,Danielle Pizzo,"February 22, 2020",5, Very motivational and easy to use. I think the food diary and exercise journal is great. The weight in and weight tracker is very good helps me keep track of where I am and what weight I should be at. Down 21 pounds in 6 weeks.
939,Noel Gaines,"February 10, 2020",5," I love it! I realized while doing Noom, that I need to lose weight the same way I intend to maintain it. Not by cutting out foods or depriving myself, because those things aren't sustainable. Noom is great for this, with its tips a nd pysch tricks it's very helpful!!"
940,Robert Klesper,"February 16, 2020",4, Have lost 23 (60 lb goal) lbs in 6 weeks and am becoming mindful of my long established eating process. The information is very good but the content format is very sophomoric and cloying. I have come to accept that it is part of the price of the otherwise good program.
941,Alexandria Romero,"February 25, 2020",5," I love how they challenge, educate and encourage me! I learn something new daily but they make it fun to read the articles. They add a little each day so it's not overwhelming and I love how the goal is to create lasting, lifelong healthy habits."
942,Tagsin TX,"February 27, 2020",4," Great program. I love the psychology of it making me think about how I'm eating while the food logging makes me wiser. But the pedometer doesn't work at all, not even after I linked my fitbit to it. Great but room for improvement."
943,Amy Krasky,"February 27, 2020",3, The program itself it fine. But they cheaped out on the android app. So I'm paying the same as apple users but I feel like the android app is a beta test. When contacted they don't really seem to care. Like if we get enough complaints we'll do something.
944,James Zappa,"February 29, 2020",3," The food logging in this app is terrible. I can't seem to edit or delete items I enter manually and it doesn't properly store the information. If I enter the info for a single serving, then tell the app I ate two servings, from them on it shows the 2 servings calorie total as the 1 serving total."
945,Tamara Edwards,"March 5, 2020",4," Love it. But as an app it's not great. Work out tracking does not always work. There are other less expensive apps that are cheaper and work better. However,as a program with the coaches and the team, it is truly awesome and worth the price."
946,Michelle McElhannon,"March 6, 2020",5, I have lost 10 pounds in six weeks. This app gives you focus and is so easy to use. There is so much good information available. I love they way they categorize things and break it down so it's easy to understand. I have more to loose but I know I'll be able to do it with noom!
947,Bethany Morgan,"March 6, 2020",1," I went through the sign up process through the web and now after downloading the app and logging in, it tells me ""Oops, error because your phone isn't connected to the internet"" but I am using my home wifi. Experience so far is poor."
948,Alison Love,"March 11, 2020",5," I wasn't too sure if I would get much out of this, but I have found it very worthwhile. The programme is motivating and informative, and the ability to log weight, exercise, and daily calorie intake all in one app is great. And I have lost 16lb in two months!"

952,Shannon Forrer,"April 22, 2020",5, Great program. Very logical and user friendly.
953,Ronda Andrews,"March 4, 2020",5, Very interactive so it keeps you engaged. I'm finding thst as long as I track each meal and keep measuring and weighing to keep within my allotted calories I'm losing the weight. Can live without the posts. Buy you are not required to post so they can be ignored.
954,janette knox,"February 17, 2020",4, The app really keeps me on task and I am seeing positive results. One negative is that the pedometer does not always register steps but that is easily resolved by using another one. I have now lost 4kilos and am close to my goal weight.
955,Danielle Dargavel,"February 2, 2020",2," The consistent daily articles are great and motivating, but the goal specialist is pretty useless. I was enjoying it until I got to the lesson called ""tame your inner elephant"", where your elephant is the part of you that tells you to go to happy hour with friends instead of the gym. Just appalling."
956,Jonathan Blekkenhorst,"February 6, 2020",4," I'm losing the weight and the knowledge I've gained will be useful for life long after uninstalling the app. I'll be buying in for a membership after the trial. Would have given five stars, but I cant turn off message push notifications for tags including @group from my coach."
957,Gurmeet Chohan,"February 8, 2020",4, Works really well. Easy to use. Great tools to help you on your weight loss journey. Food library is very extensive making it easy to keep food diary. Only issue is pedometer doesn't always pick up all my steps.
958,Brenda Kaiser,"February 11, 2020",4, Love the program! A few barcode scanned items not matching product label within Noom's database. Also would like to be able to add my own recipes after I make them more green vs red. Losing weight!! Plateaus are hard so weighing in daily can be frustrating during them.
959,Holly Sullivan,"February 16, 2020",4, I'm a week into free trial and do far I am really enjoying it. The only drawback is that I can't still use MyFitnessPal to log meals. Their database and the fact I've been using it for many years would make life so much easier.
960,Louise Heywood,"February 11, 2020",5, I only downloaded for 2 week free trial but it's the only weight loss program I've ever stuck to more than 2 weeks! Really is changing my relationship with food. Have lost weight and eating healthier without feeling restricted. Definitely worth a try.
961,Susie Hurst,"February 23, 2020",5, Love it! I've been telling all my colleagues about it and I've been using it every day without fail. The paid version is better because it unlocks support and recipes to keep you on track. Well worth the money when we're thinking about our health.

With COVID-19 and being a healthcare professional I never had the opportunity to get pass signup. With the intent to cancel i assumed i would get a notification that my trial was ending, but did not. With COVID-19 I needed that reminder to cancel a service I never used and won't use given this situation. I am requesting a refund and will follow-up my post once I recieved the link to cancel (which is the only way to cancel) and how they respond to refunding my 129"
988,Anna Gustafson,"March 22, 2020",5, I lost 9 pounds in one month. This is the easiest diet I have done. It gives me the reason why I eat the way I do and helps me to change my habits. Every day I have helpful tips. It has helped me stay on track by also counting my calories for the day. I am so happy that I choose to do Noom. 👍
989,Amie Grzesik,"March 23, 2020",5, I've been using Noom for exactly one month and I really enjoy it! App overall is easy to use and navigate. Noom overall is really helpful in teaching you healthy habits. I've learned a lot and am noticing a big change in my body but moreso my health.
990,michael henderson,"April 15, 2020",5, Great program! Helps you break down change into doable parts! Already lost some weight in first week and can see I'm gathering the building blocks that will get me across the finish line to life long weight loss.
991,Barbara Sinnott,"April 17, 2020",5," This app will surprise you. Using a psychological approach it painlessly educates you on body maintenance information, which somehow converts into gradual weight loss - by magic as far as I can tell. Nothing else worked, this does."
992,Kenneth McGrady,"April 18, 2020",5," Results soon with commitment to program. Calorie tracker is great, easy and kind of fun. Already learned i can live without a lot of my favorite snacks and food with replacements. Weight loss on four of five days already, scale not so scary anymore."
993,Traci Donahue,"April 19, 2020",4," Just starting and on week five. App is easy to use and has great tools. I only gave it a four due to the step counter. It is great, but not real accurate, but I still watch it."

I have struggled since my teen years with emotional eating, negative self thoughts, and weight gain. With in the first 2 weeks I lost weight just by making some simple changes to my routines. Noom makes logging food EASY! I have never logged my food because to me it was an overwhelming task. Well, logging my food was my first personal challenge and that simple step has changed my relationship with food. Noom Rocks!"
995,Kingsley James,"April 23, 2020",5, Awesome! This helps me to stay on track and I am having great results! No quitting for me. Thanks Noom!
996,Amber Davidson,"April 22, 2020",5," Granted, I am only 8 days in. However, this program is very informative, motivational, and I can already see changes in my habits. Not to mention, it is day 8 and I am 3 lbs down."
997,Liisa Parlas,"February 18, 2020",5, Fun helpful way to lose weight. Lowered my blood pressure. Mini helpful hints to think about through out the process. Helps record meals and calorie count with new recepies to try. Easy to keep track of exercise and helped me to lose weight slowly.
998,mariah plants,"February 3, 2020",4, Love this app however I really would like to see a way to make your own recipes and have the calorie break down for the ingredients and servings. Currently is a guessing game on how many calories your eating when it comes to making your own recipes that are more then one serving
999,Alexandra Chastain,"February 10, 2020",1, As an Android user that pays the same amount as an apple user. The features are not the same and integration with Google fit is flaky at best. My calorie count is never correct because it never takes in what I've burned. I have to manually add every excerise. The Fitbit integration Auto adds
1000,Stephen Glick,"February 22, 2020",5, I've been using Noom for 6 weeks and I'm very excited about my progress. They focus on education teaching about how the body works both physically and mentally. It builds you up and gives you lots of resources and reasons to succeed at losing weight. I highly recommend this program.

Unfortunately i didnt cancel my trial and got slugged the price. Dont expect any meal plans either as that costs extra. Oh and if youre a breast feeding mum like i am, the app wont take this into account so your results are innacurate (as breastfeeding mums need an extra 500 calories a day). Maybe try making your app more personalised."

1004,Brooke B,"March 10, 2020",1," I downloaded and paid for this app but can't access it due to an error. I put in a support ticket request and have not heard anything back. The app keeps saying it can not sign me in because I'm not connected to the internet, but that is not accurate."

1010,Sam Sam,"March 29, 2020",5, 4 weeks in and I've lost 10pounds without feeling I'm on a diet. The daily sessions help you make green food choices and give you tips on how to fight your demons. The coach gives you challenges and helps you figure out the whys. The group are supportive and it's great to share ideas and tips.

It's so much more than just a calorie counter or something like myfitnesspal or fitbit. Here's the thing, me, and probably most people, have never really been taught the positives of food, learned about nutrition, or even how to put it all together. Noom takes your hand and in baby steps, helps teach you how and why, certain foods, activities, thoughts, behaviors, etc. are good and why some are bad. It's amazing. Try it!"
1012,Adam Zahn,"April 3, 2020",3," The app is awesome but super expensive...not sure if I'll keep it past the trial. If I was rating the app based on features only, I'd give 5 stars; the 3 stars is factoring in the super high cost."
1013,Marcena Boles,"April 5, 2020",5, It makes it so easy to keep track of what you are doing calorie intake verses calorie burn. Plus they are very funny and instructive. It is fun and I am losing weight.
1014,Faisal Abbas,"April 6, 2020",1," Borderline fraudulent. They charge your card without any notification or warning for a subscription, following the so called free trial. Their adverts need to be reported to Google and Facebook."
1015,Jane Blackmore,"April 14, 2020",5," Noom has really ""clicked"" for me. I love that you deal with real food in real life. It's teaching me how to do this as a lifestyle not a diet. I've lost almost 14 lbs. In a month! Great program."
1016,Richard Ignacz,"April 20, 2020",5, So far so good. Lots of good information and I want to keep coming back to the app to finish off all my tasks everyday.

1019,Sydney Johnson,"February 3, 2020",1," interesting concept, but so not worth it. The app its self is a complete scam. Once I was done with my trial run, it took 150 bucks out of my account without telling me! Not worth the money and so not worth the time."
1020,Shannon Ensinger,"January 31, 2020",4, Love the concept of Noom and the learning. The behavioral modification is pretty life altering. I do wish that the Android version of the app had the ability to create recipes. This is the biggest fault in my opinion.
1021,Andrew Fish,"February 2, 2020",5, Very user friendly and informative. They seem to have a very strategic and interactive way to lose weight. They try to assist you in developing healthy habits or behaviors to keep the weight off. I really appreciate their approach.

1024,Carrie Hensley,"February 10, 2020",5, I've been using noom for 4 weeks now and it has opened my eyes. This is the app for anyone who thinks nothing out there will work. Trust me it does.

1025,John Carr,"February 19, 2020",5," For those that are motivated and simply need some structure, this is great. The entertaining way the psychology is presented helps me. The tool talks to my scale app and my Fitbit and while those apps refuse to lie on my behalf, it is really efficient."
1026,Andrew Dodson,"February 24, 2020",3," Good intentions, bad functionality. Opening bar code scanner causes app to crash, pedometer won't link up. Basically it's just a calorie counter. It has a wide variety of foods which is nice, but very clunky otherwise."

1028,Mike Barker,"March 2, 2020",5," Very helpful, easy to use, at my pace. Helps to stay motivated plus learning sustainable habits and food knowledge that will assist me in learning to eat a little more intelligently rather than more of less emotionally. Would try and sign up again."
1029,Judi Eby,"March 1, 2020",5, Learning to eat better & healthier foods. Also how to lose weight & keep it off forever. Smaller plate = smaller portions. You will still be satisfied. I've gone from 203# to 170.6# since I started 4 weeks ago & still losing. Noom is worth every penny!

1036,Mo Joukhadar,"March 24, 2020",5, So helpful to be guided through the psychological tricks for weight loss. Also tracking with tricolor food groups is a different way. Noom analyses your food tracking. Also they are funny and information comes through in small bites. Very clear. Thank you noom.
1037,John Whalen,"April 2, 2020",5, Just what I needed to keep me on task. The daily interaction is vital to keeping me engaged. The check ins with my coach are very helpful. The system is really working for me.

1039,Adrianna Glass,"April 11, 2020",5, I have been using Noom for a week and love it. If traditional diets didn't work for you try this program. Seeing what you are eating and how much is what's helping me. I'm a visual learner!

1046,Ramona Bernard,"February 17, 2020",5," This system is working for me. 6 weeks, 13.4 pounds. I find the explanation, psychology, data stuff compelling and the calorie logging component is very easy. Makes me think twice about grabbing a handful of ANYthing... I'm going to have to log it??!"

1050,Juan Cotto,"February 13, 2020",5, NOOM has helped me understand my relationship with food and the impacts it has on my health and well being. It has allowed me not only to make changes but understand the changes necessary to be healthy. I could not reccomend this app more enthusiastically.
1051,Thomas Griffith,"February 11, 2020",5," Great learning and accountability features, makes it easier to track and stay on track with food choices. If you bring the motivation and discipline, Noom will provide the tools and knowledge to be successful."
1052,Isaac Fox-Poulsen,"February 25, 2020",2," The Android app is missing multiple things compared to the iOS app from Noom, which is absolutely unacceptable. In particular, there is no way to create custom recipes, nor do 50 calories get added to your daily budget automatically for every 2000 steps."
1053,R Terre,"February 24, 2020",4, I gave 4 stars because i am unable to log homecooked food recipes. It only brings up restaurants and package items. In addition often the label reader sose not access the detail for the food items. Lastly I have to scroll for the exercises intead of a search. It is time consuming .
1054,Beverly Warren,"February 21, 2020",5, I really like the daily check in and the help to have me look at what kind of eater I am and how to change it. I also bought the weekly meal plan and work out plan and those have helped me to stay on track and put variation in my work out.

1061,Karen York,"March 21, 2020",5, I love the app so far. My coach is great with keeping in touch with me and encouraging me along the way. I love the group as well. Everyone is so supportive and the group coach provides lots of support and great informatiom.
1062,David Mutahi,"March 28, 2020",5, Great source of information and tips bundled together in one app that helps you keep track of your feeding and health lifestyle. Just what you need to stay and keep fit.
1063,Pushp Deep Pandey,"March 30, 2020",2," Was a paid user. I would say it has a Horrible interface. Keeps crashing whenever i log food and app hangs.

1064,Cathy Coulson,"March 29, 2020",4," Effective program, good support, nice tracking. UPC scanner doesn't locate food 90% of the time, but most foods are findable in the database. Psychology pertaining to eating habits is helpful."

1071,Andrea Hendricks,"April 19, 2020",5, It's been great experience for me. I'm accountable every day and am being taught how to eat better. Going on my 5th week and I have lost 10 pounds so far. I'm looking forward to learning more and losing more.
1072,Simone Cassidy,"April 17, 2020",5, I honestly didn't think this would work for me. My weight loss is slow but steady and all the things I need to implement are so manageable. A much more effective program than I anticipated.
1073,Chris DeWitt,"February 20, 2020",5, Love the app. I'm still in the 2-week trial period but will be signing up for the full program. Definitely works for weight loss. Keeps you on-target and focused on meeting your commitment to yourself.
1074,Spencer Vincent,"February 17, 2020",5," It's actually working for me, I'm on week 8 and I've lost 15 pounds so far. Great for making you stay accountable for how you treat your body. I love that I get a personal health guru to talk to as well, it helps so much!"
1075,Kacy Lane,"February 17, 2020",3," I love the weight loss program, but the app itself is full of glitches, you cant connect other apps or devices, the pedometer built in does not work, and you can only adjust the step count the next day."
1076,Pamela Jimenez,"February 11, 2020",5," Great tool! Really helps you change your relationship with food. It's not a diet, it's a mindset. They give you the tools to break bad habits and bust diet myths. Great support system and realistic goals"
1077,Sushil Verghese,"February 19, 2020",3," I like the app. But some small things annoy me. I'm not able to log in decimal points while adding the calories of new foods not in your database. Also, there is no option for me to share recipes via whatsapp or email with my cook."
1078,Christina Olson,"February 26, 2020",3," The app is great for logging food. However the step counter isn't working on my Galaxy s10, which is annoying because my work doesn't allow me to wear my Fitbit because breakaway bands aren't available and I work in MFG. Please fix your step counter!"
1079,Cindy Zellefrow,"February 28, 2020",5," Responsive app, engaging program! Have struggled with weight for a lifetime doing many different diets snd weight loss programs over the years but I ve learned more about behaviors around food and getting to my best version of me in spite of being a healthcare professional! LOVIN' NOOM!!"
1080,Kelly Keane,"March 1, 2020",5," A lot of information on a daily basis but if you read it all, believe in the program (and yourself) and follow it all, it can work. I am down 15 pounds and going on week 7. It isn't a diet, it's a lifestyle change breaking years (and years) of bad habits."
1081,Cheryl Andrews,"March 8, 2020",4," Started out good, but as the weeks went on there was a lot more to read. I did not have 30 mons to read everything. I stll log in my meals and read what I can, but I feel that I'm not getting the full picture. If you have time to read more as it goes, its great."
1082,Kari Baker,"March 7, 2020",1," Won't let me sign up. It continues to tell me I'm not connected to the internet and I know, for sure, I am and have a good connection. No way to possibly use the app if I can't get through the sign up process. PLEASE FIX!!!!"

Unfortunately they continue to be unable to provide all customers with chart showing weight history since our starting noom.

No food is forbidden, so there's a higher chance of it working. The various suggestions for trying new foods and goal setting has been very useful. The only negative is the bias towards Americanisms, the food entry also USA centric and ye-haw high fiving nonsense. But ignore that bit and it's a really good app, it gets the job done."
1085,Chris M,"March 13, 2020",5," I dont often review apps, but I must say, I've tried to lose weight in the past and never made any progress. This program has changed that for me. After 7 weeks, I went from 192 to 178 and have another 13 lbs to go. I like this app!"
1086,Tawnie Overton,"April 4, 2020",4, Its very helpful being able to tune into my goals each day. The daily reminders help me to stay aware of what I wish to accomplish in the long term!
1087,Jamie Warner,"April 10, 2020",5," Noom has been amazing, the course is easy to follow and very informative. The support provided by the variety of coaches is invaluable. I have lost 9kg in four weeks and feel great, it is much more than a diet, more of a lifestyle change."
1088,Anne Radford,"April 12, 2020",4, This app analyzes your foods you log per meal. You can easily see how many calories you have remaining in the three groups. Very helpful when it comes to foods in the category best eaten minimally thru the day.

The app let's me log my daily food choices, my exercise routine, and shows the impact that my food choices have on my health and weight. I have eliminated processed sugar and significantly lowered joint achs and stiffness. Remember, all of the above benefits are the result of working the system, valuing your body and being honest with yourself."
1090,April Hildred,"April 17, 2020",5," I was shocked with the immediate weight loss, just by making small diet changes. The app is very fun to use, and the coach is an actual person, not a virtual one."
1091,Joy Jordan,"April 25, 2020",5, As a dietitian I was curious how this program differs from others and am very impressed. Definitely will be recommending to my clients!
1092,Kimberly Freeman,"April 24, 2020",5, This program is great!!! Very informative and encouraging.
1093,Jennifer Dawson,"February 1, 2020",5," I have achieved excellent weight loss results that are totally sustainable. Noon helped me find a new normal that has led to healthier eating habits, lower BMI, and I still get to indulge from time to time."
1094,Emily Berghorn,"February 29, 2020",4," Finding the app to be very useful; however, it would be so much better if there was a place to enter a recipe that could then be used you log meals. Even if it was just in our own personal database, it would be so handy!"
1095,Garner Francis,"January 31, 2020",5," Great app for those who serious about dieting. Great motivational tips on ways improve your healthy lifestyle, and eating habits. I'm now more conscious about what I eat along with how much exercise is acceptable. I believe that l've found the right app."
1096,Jan Hortin Ellenburg,"February 5, 2020",5, I have only been on this program 5 weeks and find it's working the best of any program I have tried...love the coaching.

1097,Dominic Ritzer,"February 6, 2020",1," garbage. the coach checks in once a week. I've lost 20 lbs, the logging food thing with weight graph is helpful, but the free app on the phone does this. suppose the $129 to do this tho makes me want to check every day so I get my money's worth but cancelling asap."
1098,Jeanette Lynch,"February 11, 2020",5," Noom introduces ideas incrementally. I can take the time to fully understand and assimilate this information without feeling overwhelmed. This step by step keeps me motivated with a ""can do"" attitude."
1099,Stacy Schnaare,"February 29, 2020",4," Overall I really like the app. on the Android phone it doesn't allow me to make my own custom recipes and save them, although there is a work around. As a habit changing app and program, I am 100% happy with it."
1100,Susan Bulk,"February 19, 2020",5," 6 weeks in, I have lost 7+ pounds. Being accountable every day is helpful, as are the daily lessons. I really find that my tastes are changing for the better. The program incorporates mindfulness, activity, and sleep in addition to changing eating habits."
1101,jol dzski,"February 28, 2020",5," Truly transformational APP (for me) that has driven significant positive behaviour modifications related to diet, exercise and overall health. Not a real APP person, but Noom has been fun, educational and effective for me....8 weeks in and plan to keep using it !"
1102,Tammy Webb,"March 2, 2020",5," The lessons help me make sense about why I have not been able to lose the weight. But with the knowledge I have learned, and putting it into practice, I believe I have figured out how my body responds and the weight is slowly coming off."
1103,LeeAnn Jaramillo,"March 10, 2020",4," So far I am pleased with Noom! The only thing I would add, is the exercise list does not have Jazzersize as a work out. Jazzersize has been around for 50 years and is nation wide and in other country's."
1104,Kaniner Flagg,"March 12, 2020",1," Ridiculously over priced. ""Goal specialist"" is a joke. Customer ""support"" is a joke. Was offered $19 a month but they would only let me sign up for $59 a month for a glorified calorie tracker! [Edit] the ""support"" did NOTHING and repeated the $59 price."
1105,Helen Gonzales,"March 23, 2020",5," This has been an amazing journey. I love being able to eat as I normally do, the coaching, goal setting, and weekly challenges keep me on track and if I get off track it is easy to get right back on I am losing my weight. I am so happy."
1106,Beverly Hartz,"March 25, 2020",5," One week into Noom and very excited about the support they give and the 3 lbs lost! It is a great way to keep on track and organized. If you are ready to get your bad eating habits under control, Noom is a great support system."
1107,Nancy Hansen,"March 29, 2020",5," I am incredibly impressed! The psychology makes this different from every diet and weight loss tool you have ever tried. If you put in the effort, you get results that you can maintain for a lifetime."
1108,Amber Logan,"April 2, 2020",5," This has been a great experience. Noom is giving me tools to set me up for long term success. No elimination of foods, but equipping me to make better choices to become a healthier me. Recommend this to anyone who has struggled with sticking to a healthy plan."
1109,Gina Paxton,"April 3, 2020",5, I love the color system! It guides me in making healthier food choices and has shown me a few times that my snack choice wasn't as healthy as (quick glance) packaging lead me to believe
1110,Christine Fournier,"April 3, 2020",5, So great! It's a pleasure to have a positive reminder of your big picture and why you want to loose weight! It's motivating and NOOM makes it easy!
1111,Phil K,"April 4, 2020",5, Made it through the first week! Fun and informative app. Helps for healthy habits. Helps you learn why you eat the way you eat and how it affects you. Love it so far!
1112,Brandon,"April 6, 2020",5," Good program so far (week 2). I like that it's not restrictive dieting, it's more mindful eating. Progress is really easy to track as well."
1113,jill smith,"April 9, 2020",5," I think the app is fine and till this pandemic, I was focused but it has been very difficult with this shelter in place and the general anxiety. Im going to try to start over but hopefully you will add some free or discounted weeks at the end"

1115,A Google user,"April 10, 2020",5, I love Noom! It's so much more than a weight loss program. It's like a life coach! The psychology tips and tricks are fantastic. I've learned a lot through the daily articles and quizzes. Well worth it!
1116,Mike Hardie,"April 17, 2020",5, The notifications help keep me motivated and focused. Very helpful way to teach a new way of eating and the choices we have. I've gone down 20 lbs. In four weeks. Thanks Noom!

Now that I'm working remotely (thanks COVID?), I have more time for myself to build good habits such as working out and making healthy meals. I've started logging my meals, my workouts, and have connected Noom to my Google Fit account. I love Noom's articles, insights, and reminders. One thing I'm super disappointed about is the lack of the Custom Recipe feature for Android that is available on iOS devices. What's the point of all this logging if I can't put in my recipes?"
1118,Lou Rhyne,"April 24, 2020",2, Can't figure out the pedometer. Everything else is perfect.
1119,Carrie Hebert,"April 25, 2020",4, This has been a very useful tool for me and my weight loss journey. It's as if you have a friend in your pocket helping with each step you take. And educating you along the way.

The weight graph is the strongest example - very frustrating to see Apple users constantly posting condensed weight graphs in support groups, yet we can only see a month at a time. I know a lot of users who have had to resort to using a second app for weight tracking."
1122,Dana Graham,"February 4, 2020",5," Incredibly informative! I've learned so much and the group and coach support helps keep me on track and motivated. Love all of the extra tools like step tracking, weight loss graphing, recipes, and food calculators."
1123,Barbara Wegner,"February 1, 2020",5," I've been able to lose weight with Noom when nothing else has worked. I used the Zone diet for years with success, but now in my 60s it doesn't help anymore. I also tried Keto without success. I believe that Noom will help me reach my goal!"
1124,Zuzana Sabolová,"February 6, 2020",1," App is amazing and the advice is very valuable. However, be careful. They will extend your subscription without any notification!!! It is very cheeky. Isn't it polite to ask at least????"
1125,Kelly Kautz,"February 7, 2020",1," Seems interesting but should have looked closer at the reviews. 99 bucks for a food tracker app doesn't make sense. Very shady in the pricing, makes you think you're picking your dollar range per month, but really just for the trial."
1126,Emma Withey,"February 29, 2020",5," Really good advice, easy to understand, and brilliant principal. But adding recipes isn't easy. I also paid extra for a meal and workout plan but don't seem to be able to access it."
1127,Peter Gordon,"February 14, 2020",5," This provides a sensible approach to modifying your diet and using behavior modification to create real healthy change. I enjoy tracking my food, communicating with my ""group"" and learning about my attitudes towards food. And yes, I'm getting results."

It is definitely changing my mind and making me better understand the science and health behind my eating behaviors. If I could make one suggestion though...maybe alot a little more time between lessons to really work on each one so it becomes second nature.

1134,Alex Miel,"February 26, 2020",2," This app is bad. Two starts for a great UI and interface. But the pedometer doesn't work and when I log exercise, it doesn't even subtract those calories from my daily allowance. Like, what's the point? Trash."
1135,Martha Van Neste,"February 29, 2020",4, Noom asks questions so it may personalize users' advice. It offers several answers to choose from -- but all the questions I've seen allow only one answer choice. Sometimes more than one answer is true for me; life is more complicated than the Noom questions seem to allow!
1136,Deborah Wilt,"March 3, 2020",5," I absolutely love this app. It is so helpful with my weightloss, with it's reminders and a coach to help you out. I cannot believe I am eating what I want (in moderation) and losing weight too. #gonoomers"

1145,Rhodi West,"March 25, 2020",5, This is a totally different way to look at your eating habits...I love the psychology in this approach.

1146,Lia Heisig,"March 26, 2020",4," I love the accountability and motivation aspects of this app. It can improve by allowing the use of the dot when logging half measures for new foods. Currently it only allows you to enter either 2 or 3 grams (of something), but not 2.5"

1160,Mia Haché,"February 9, 2020",5," This app is just amazing, you can really tell they put a lot of time and thought into it. Week one I'm down over 5 pounds and will be reaching my goal quickly without the hassle of a ""diet"","
1161,Hannah Tomlin,"February 11, 2020",1, Signed up yesterday to a trial and the app won't even load or open. I will be deleting and cancelling my account if this is not fixed by tomorrow. I'm not letting you take £100 in 13 days if it's not working!
1162,Shawna McKean,"February 12, 2020",5," Easy to use. The reminders and daily articles are humorous, informative and keep you motivated. The daily step goals have been achievable. The best part? Im losing weight!"
1163,Briana Brokvist,"February 16, 2020",3, I have lost some weight on this app. I like scanning what i eat and counting calories. But it's an awful lot of reading... like a half hour a day. I find it time consuming and end up falling behind.
1164,Brian Hunter,"February 14, 2020",5, It's not like most weight loss apps that just have you track your food and show you healthy recipes. It really gets behind the psychology of eating and gives you practical ways to live healthier regardless of your situation.
1165,Michelle Negrete,"February 14, 2020",4, Overall really great! I wish there was a way I can enter recipes and then it (the app) can break down serving sizes. So I am not really sure if I am adding the right amount of calories per serving size.
1166,Deborah Martin,"February 15, 2020",5," Consistent supportive actual help. Actively makes you chart your progress interacting with your coaches and your group opening your thoughts to change the way you view not dieting, but diet. Everything is at your choice to participate."
1167,Jarom Hatch,"February 16, 2020",3," Good for logging, keep getting notifications that say are from my coach but they don't show up in the chat. Guessing they are automated. But there's no way to go find out what they say."
1168,Victor Lopez,"February 20, 2020",5," Great app to use to track meal consumption trends, steps, exercise, etc. What stands out with this app for me is that after using both the free and paid versions, I've concluded that both are great and comprehensive to use!"
1169,Vicki Karstens,"February 25, 2020",4," It's early in the game yet, but I'm enjoying the daily focus on the issue until it gets resolved. Namely, losing excess baggage. I'm looking forward to stepping into my closet again to wear anything at any time."
1170,Jana Hunt,"February 28, 2020",5, It was very surprising to find it working. But it has. I am 59 and have tried many things that did not work. I have been doing this for 1 week and have lost 9 lbs. It is also very easy and does not take up much time. I have found my sweet spot. Sweet!
1171,Debbie Tschauder,"February 29, 2020",5," This program is so different from all the other diets I've tried (Jenny Craig, TOPS, WW etc). It's really helping me change HOW I think about the food I eat which translates to sustainable behavior changes and not food avoidance. 5*****"

This is the first time with all my weight loss ventures where I feel good, in control, understand what I am doing and the weight is coming off. Will definitely continue on this route until I reach my goal. With Noom you have a clear vision and your learning."
1173,Kelly Johnson,"March 9, 2020",5, Very helpful. It's not an all or nothing program. It teaches you how to eat healthy but does not scold or make you feel bad if you falter a bit. It teaches that treats are ok occasionally. Very encouraging.
1174,Shakeila Duke,"March 15, 2020",1, I've been trying to work with noom support and was emailed today that my account wasn't active (it is) and they are doing away with the free version. So basically if you are not paying they are not interested in really making your app experience better.
1175,Spiro Potamianos,"March 14, 2020",5," The app is great. Provides informative information while keeping it simple. Has a coach and use of support group that you interact with on a daily basis. If you are ready to take charge of your health, give it a try."
1176,Barbra Jones,"March 19, 2020",5, Noom us so easy and fun to use!!! :) I love all the goofy statements and finally learning Psych 101 at 54 years old! They've made it all so ridiculously easy that even this old tech-challenged brain can do it and l lost 3 lbs in first 6 days!!
1177,Michelle Houston,"March 26, 2020",5," After one week of logging food and using the other features of the app, I feel like I am on track. Not to mention that I am down 8 pounds. This will certainly level off, but I know my coach will help me persevere. I highly recommend Noom."
1178,A Google user,"March 27, 2020",5," It was so good to learn about the HOW and the WHY, not only the what I was eating. I've changed my whole thought process when it comes to food and I feel great! Oh and it works....25# in 8 weeks. Quick but smart and sustainable."
1179,Karlie Hartman,"March 28, 2020",5, So far I really enjoy the program and have been successful with it! There are some places where the app itself could use some adjusting but overall highly recommend!
1180,Jeff Halverson,"March 28, 2020",5, It's a good app for tracking your food and weight gains and losses. Their theory of moderation is more common sense than just depriving me of things I like. On week 5 of the plan.
1181,Caleb Enerson,"March 31, 2020",5, Very helpful tool for learning how to become healthier. Creative writing makes the content more pleasant than you would expect. Very pleased.

1184,Angela Zellers,"April 5, 2020",5, It's so easy to use. It's also been so helpful. I'm already a week in and it inspires me to work out daily to have more calories and still allow me to eat what I love..
1185,Antoinette Liquet,"April 23, 2020",5, The app is very organized and motivating. I've never logged my food in my whole life. This makes it so easy and manageable. Love it.
1186,Kimmo Kyllonen,"February 9, 2020",5, Noom offers very good tips and tricks to develop healthier eating habits combined with exersice and sets you up on the path loosing weight and keeping it of overtime. I have lost 15 lb in 4 weeks with noom so far and I can eat and drink what I want. Cheers!

1188,Cat Harper,"February 12, 2020",4," I'm only on week two of my trial period, but I really like it so far! I have noticed my eating habits improving a lot, I'm eating a lot more veggies, and it's kinda fun to read the daily articles."
1189,Luis Constantino,"February 19, 2020",4," The calorie measures in the food database is sometimes inaccurate; particularly with scanned food items, in my experience. For ecample, I scanned Signature Kitchens Original Flavpr Instant Oatmeal that is 100 calories for 28 g and the database recorded it as Safeway Oats for 1 cal."
1190,Dawn Capra,"February 12, 2020",4," I love that this app forces you to be accountable for your actions and choices. I also like the psychology behind their ""classes"". I have hit a plateau and haven't been able to move past it, but my overall health and energy level, and strength have increased."
1191,Wallace Long III,"February 11, 2020",5," Great 1 on 1 support as well as team support! Program is well thought out, thorough, and fun! Price is a little high, bit you can contact them and they'll work with you a they did with me to make it work."

It's so empowering and makes you look at yourself and the reasons why your losing weight, literally why you dont want to be or go back to being the fatter, unhappier version of yourself. I cannot recommend this app enough."
1193,Sarah Nielsen,"February 21, 2020",2," Add ons are a complete waste of money if you have even a basic knowledge of meal planning or workouts plans. The ""custom"" part is non-existent. No where did it ask for food allergies or take into account my specific physical limitations I did list out."
1194,christie sarver,"February 25, 2020",5, This app is really helping me stay on track with my health and fitness goals. It provides alot of tips and tools to use. I highly recommend this to anyone who feels they are in a rut and need some help shedding some weight!

1198,Melia Fehrmann,"April 16, 2020",5," Love the program. The articles can be a bit much. If there was an option to listen to audio articles, I'd prefer that. I don't always have time to read them everyday."
1199,Holly Sanchez,"March 5, 2020",5, This program is a great way to learn how to manage your weight and diet in a fun and motivating way. They give you the tools and teach the mindset you need to follow along. I look forward to seeing what they have to share each day. Fantastic program!
1200,jonschieman,"March 9, 2020",5," Easy to navigate app. If you follow the program and stick to the recommended changes, you drop weight relatively well. Not a diet but a new way to think more about what and why you eat."

1203,Kelley Busch,"March 15, 2020",5, It's only been a week but I am in love with this ap. It's perfect for me. I know what I need to do but have a hard time actually doing it and this app is like a weight loss therapist in your pocket. Down 3 lbs in first week. Not a bad start.
1204,Melody Overton,"March 17, 2020",5," Love this app. This is not a fad diet. Instead it educates me daily, inspires me to exercise and make good choices, gives me support, and works! I feel much healthier and have tons of energy. Thanks Noom!"
1205,Marilyn Phelps,"March 21, 2020",5, I lost 6 pounds the first week and that gave me the motivation to continue. The food logging is easy and very helpful. Every day they provide scientific and psychological information about what to do to lose the weight. Give it a try.
1206,KIMBERLY Daniel,"March 27, 2020",5," Exceptionally helpful for me in understanding many aspects of the 'why'. I do well with information and with things that make sense, so the learning has made a big difference for me. But not so much that it's overwhelming."

1208,Paul Pearon,"April 4, 2020",5," I'm just finishing week 1 and have already lost weight. Utilizing the app makes a difference in my eating and exercising habits. The app, interaction and support are very encouraging and are also helping me stay motivated."
1209,Kristin Krum,"April 5, 2020",4, Noom is easy to use and IT WORKS! Well it has been for me anyways 😁 I love how they tackle things and have a fun carefree way of doing it. So tame your elephant and give NOOM a try. What have you got to lose besides weight?
1210,Nicole L Evans,"April 12, 2020",5," I had doubts, but I am seeing results in the first week. I am a believer! I have tried MFP and consistent exercise and didn't get the results I'm seeing in week 1 with Noom."
1211,Melanie Justus,"April 18, 2020",5," Great program. Ive lost 10 pounds in 4 weeks. Easy to follow. Youre not limited on what you can eat, but it teaches you to make good choices. The app is very handy and easy to use."

1250,Nancy Shoemake,"February 24, 2020",5, I have tried so many other diet apps and this one is by far the best. 3 weeks in and i have lost 8 pounds and maintaining it. Relearning all the good stuff to take and keep off my weight.

You don't have to make a drastic change overnight. And they teach you little by little how to make these changes life long, and tailored to you, as an individual. The messages you receive each day have humor in them, which helps keep my mood light instead of feeling heavy, like a daunting task I have to do, but don't really want to. Only into it a week, but so far, I'm liking it!"
1254,Susan Clancy,"March 18, 2020",5, This program is awesome. The lessons and coaching keep you motivated. The built in step counter and calorie counter (which reads food barcode labels) add convenience. The recipes keep things interesting.
1255,Keya Arora,"March 21, 2020",1, Major Bug in the App. Can't seem to proceed beyond the custom plan. It just leads to a blank page. Tried getting through it 4 times. Doesn't work. Very disappointing.

Awful app and awful coach Rebecca, i can't believe she got promoted. This is the worst program or app i have ever spent my money to in my life! After using for a few weeks, this app started to become really laggy, and it is frustrating to keep logging in every meal with such horrible app!"
1257,su zi,"March 25, 2020",5," Really great app/program for healthy eating. Intuitive, easy to use and seamlessly becomes a part of your day. It's definitely a different approach to weight loss - recommended!"

With a coach to guide you, and a group that you can participate in, it is much easier losing weight than going it alone.

1259,Tom Keenan,"March 25, 2020",1," I never even used the trial, it will not let me login, they keep charging me 139. Thier phone number is a recording.and I had to open a dispute last time because they simply do not respond. DO NOT USE THIS APP."
1260,Beka Whitaker,"April 1, 2020",5," I am still in the 14 day trial, but consider the app very effective and easy to use so far. Good support, features, and results."
1261,Andrew Billyard,"April 5, 2020",3," App is good, but has some technical shortcomings (barcode doesn't work with Pixel 4, recipes doesn't work, and no recall function for items not found in Noom's database)."
1262,Morgan Fallows,"April 4, 2020",3, Great app let down by not syncing or registering steps done daily. It's easy enough to input manually but would be better if it actually worked or its a pointless function.
1263,Melisande Lochak,"April 9, 2020",5," Wonderful experience, for 1 pound I've had an amazing trial first week and I still have a second week for that price ! Noom offers everything you need to become who you dream, support, learning, guidance and measuring... and it works !! Thank you Noom :)"
1264,Melanie Hessbrook,"April 14, 2020",5, While I've only been doing this for a week I've already lost 11 pounds I am shocked as I have tried for most of my life to find anything that works for me. Noom works. Its that simple.
1265,christian harrison,"April 15, 2020",1," While the app may be a good weight loss app, the cancellation and refund policy are terrible. You literally have to ask your coach to cancel your subscription. Terrible customer service."

1269,Denise Dansak,"March 9, 2020",5, Just wonderful it focuses on How and Why your eating habits Impact your weigt gain. It doesn't just focus on food and food intake alone. The material is concise and the method of delivery is just perfect. I would highly recommend it.
1270,Cathy Emms,"February 4, 2020",5, Really great way to get organized and understand how to lose weight by understanding the food choices we make. Easy to log food choices for each meal. Very educational!
1271,Alycia Gonzalez,"February 6, 2020",5," Very easy to use and definitely losing weight. It's slow, steady progress. Only drawback is the in app pedometer doesn't catch all of my steps."
1272,Meemee Gomez,"February 18, 2020",4, Loveing it so far. The tracker could use more products but I'm sure it will continue to improve. One thing I think could be better is how they track calories in and out.
1273,Amabel Bristow,"February 11, 2020",4," Noom IS working for me...as far as weight loss it's great if you follow the advise correctly. The actual app is a little disappointing, I wish it loaded quicker and interacted with other features of my phone...maybe it will in the future"
1274,Marie Burns,"February 17, 2020",5," Noom has been a great help to me. I've tried so many different things to lose weight, but I have trouble sticking to them. Noom's easy to use formal and daily accountability have changed that. I've lost fourteen pounds in the past six weeks."

When you learn how to eat right, get enough sleep, and manage stress, it makes the weight loss come easy. This isn't a diet, it's a balanced, healthy lifestyle. It's not restrictive, therefore it is a sustainable program meant to teach healthy habits that last a lifetime."
1276,Veronica Glennon,"February 28, 2020",4," Overall love the program. The app still has some minor kinks to work out (food tracking isn't as detailed as My Fitness Pal, the app sometimes freezes returning to the home page from each module)"
1277,Vipin Vaidyanathan,"February 29, 2020",1, Very buggy app. Steps are not syncing correctly from Garmin. Support advised to uninstall and reinstall app. When I did that unable to login in back into the app. Stuck now without the app in between a program.
1278,Stephanie Davy,"March 4, 2020",1," Cannot get anyone to cancel trial no matter what I do and I am furious. They get you to sign on to free trial. Then tell you you will have to pay one large fee. And now I cannot cancel, though was told I could. This is ridiculous. No stars"
1279,shannon harper,"March 8, 2020",5, Noom is amazing. The app is easy to use and fun and this is the first weight loss program that I feel confident will work for me. I lost 10 pounds the first week and I feel great and am never hungry. Highly recommend.

1282,A Google user,"March 13, 2020",5, It is helpful for me to get information every day and to see results everyday. If my weight goes up or down I can see what I did the last day or 2 to see if my choices made a difference.
1283,Rachel Brown,"March 25, 2020",5, This app has helped me address the psychological side of weight loss and being healthier. I have struggled for so long this has been a God send. Thanks to my PCP for recommending it.

In actuality your guide is a bot that can't understand anything beyond a simple question or answer and takes days to respond. It also seems to be geared toward healthy people and type 2 dm. I have celiac and there was no way to follow the recommendations and no way to get it to recognize that. Also my main exercise is aquasize and that wasn't a choice. Don't waste your money.
1292,Kelsey Oates,"February 1, 2020",5," This app is excellent! It's about the psychology of weight loss and focuses on why we eat the way we do, rather than just calories. The design is wonderful and it's been very easy to keep up with."

1296,Penny Jean Tatton Gallant,"February 6, 2020",4, Great program. The only note I have is that the food logging isn't very accurate. There are a lot of inconsistencies as far as calories. Even if you scan the barcode.
1297,Jennifer Beebe,"February 6, 2020",5, Love it! I have learned so much thanks to Noom. I would definitely recommend if you are tired of dieting fads. Creating sustainable eating habits made easy. Couldn't ask for more.

1300,Michelle Wickline,"February 20, 2020",1, signed up for a $1 trial. Cancelled and deleted the app. Turns out the have charged me $129 twice since then when I never used or even had the app! Now I have to reinstall to figure out how to talk to someone to cancel AGAIN. I am SOOOO MAD!!

1303,Kahlab Ester,"February 16, 2020",3," Had the app for about a month, suddenly my steps are not registering nor can I adjust them manually. Prior to that my only complaint was not being able to split a food I've added over multiple meals."
1304,Debbie Norris,"February 11, 2020",1, I did a trial offer and didn't realize that this would charge me 129 dollars and on a 4 month cycle. What!?! This is ridiculous. No number to call or cancel and you have to email for support? Never again. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1305,Carol Gilberts,"February 16, 2020",4, I like the massive amounts of information. I wish that they offered a book that goes along with the teaching so that we can have audio and handwritten backup of said knowledge.
1306,KenandKaren Root,"February 21, 2020",5, It helps me keep focused on staying the course if losing weight. I've tried most everything but only make dents into my weight and 6 months later I'm back up. It teaches while encouraging and counts food easily yet without guilt.

1311,Ray Carlitos!5,"March 2, 2020",5," I would to say that Noom is something great to get started on. If you want to invest into it, it does cost money tho.

1355,Steph Mengel,"February 4, 2020",4," So far, so good! The app is great at reminding you to log your meals etc. I would like to see more food items that are available in Australia on the list of available items."
1356,Cheyenne Dembicki,"February 6, 2020",3," I joined this app in hopes that it would be more, but it wasnt. It wasnt the right app for me. A lot of people have had good things to say about Noom so its worth a shot if you are thinking about it. Just be wary that they charge you a 150 dollars if you forget to unsubscribe."
1357,Renee Miller,"February 14, 2020",3," Good food and exercise tracker. Support from a goal specialist, coach, and other app users in your ""group."" Step counter stopped working and is still not working."

1362,Johnelle Pauley,"February 16, 2020",5, Love the psychological quizzes and tips that help in keeping me motivated. The food log is so easy with no effort in tracking. The easiest program with the best results.

1364,Melinda Cognion,"February 27, 2020",2, I really liked it at first with the little lessons and did learn a few things but your paying big bucks for a goal specilist that just keeps asking you questions and never did really set a goal. I could do a better job i do believe.

1366,Kristy Powers,"February 29, 2020",5," Friendly, fun prompts keep me moving toward my goals. App is trouble free, with the exception of some fine tuning to do with the step counter."
1367,Donna Ventura,"February 26, 2020",5," Love it so far. It's visually helping me see my food as red, yellow and green. Love the short articles to read daily. Love the coach support."
1368,Laura Lee,"March 2, 2020",4," The app is not designed well at all. But the food tracker, daily tasks, and group are great. So overall, it's helped me lose weight and learn a lot about."
1369,Lukas Kurmann,"March 5, 2020",5," Awesome! Dive in and it works very well. But it requires work and full commitment on your end. I just lost 6kg in 4weeks of full determination. Very good app, nice concept."

1372,Crystal Smith,"March 25, 2020",5, This a wonderful program. It's so much easier than any other weight loss program I've ever been on. I've lost 11 lbs in 4 weeks and because of the psychological approach I believe it is sustainable.

1375,Robert Reinert,"April 7, 2020",5," This is not technically a diet plan . The plan incorporates psychology, sociology, and physiology and a lot of instructional components to help you not only cutback on what you're eating and lose weight but to actually help you understand the science behind the weight-loss."
1376,Samantha Drake,"April 8, 2020",5," Noom is awesome! If you're reading these reviews trying to decide if it's worth it, I'm telling you now, it totally is!!

1385,Brigid Nave,"February 15, 2020",5, Very good. I had just about given up changing my bad lifestyle health habits after years of yo-yo diets. I love the focus that is put on making the healthy changes permanent!
1386,Elizabeth Kamber,"February 3, 2020",5, Just a little bit of info every day. It keeps me motivated and it isn't too much. And it keeps track of how long I've been logging my meals so I keep doing it so I don't break my winning streak. The meal log is very easy.

Weight loss that isn't all about willpower and deprivation! I'm learning about why I eat what I eat when I eat it. I'm learning ways to meet those goals with food that works for me. No guilt (which is NOT a good long term motivator), online buddies who are on the same journey, coaches who actually help me choose my goals not push me to theirs. Well, I don't like to pay to do things that I should be able to do myself, but I am GLAD I broke my rule about that and signed up for NOOM."
1390,dan johnson,"February 20, 2020",5, This is a great tool for weight loss and changing your life. It's not like being on a diet. You can eat or drink anything you want. Noom just has a great way of making you aware of where you are and what you need to do (and eat) every day.

Decided to give Noom a try. 6 weeks in the results have been fantastic. The philosophy and tools helped me make sustainable adjustments to my lifestyle. While it hasn't always been easy, the weight is coming off. The program does require that you carve out some time for reading, relection and logging everyday (but you're worth it). If you are willing to make the commitment the program works!"
1392,Shannon Harrod,"February 17, 2020",4, Some features aren't working for me. Such as I can't connect to Samsung Health for my step count and the chat doesn't update. I get push notifications from my coach but cant see the actual message in the app

1395,Rachel Aracan,"February 25, 2020",5, It works 👌. After giving birth I needed extra help to lose weight. Using noom Ive now lost 8kgs in less than 3 months with eating right and walking.

1397,Ann Rennison,"March 1, 2020",5, Noom has helped me to understand why I have struggled to lose the weight in the past. Instead of just telling me what to eat or what not to eat it explains why and what different foods do to help me change.

1399,properhit,"March 6, 2020",1," Unable to login. Tried Uninstalling and reinstalling. Tells me I am not connected to the internet, which isn't true. The app is worthless after they get your money."
1400,Aleysia Babb,"March 9, 2020",5," Great support and information. Helps people understand that yes you will have setbacks, but that no one is perfect and yet can still achieve their goal of improving their health through behavior modification when it comes to eating."
1401,Sharon Williams,"March 9, 2020",4," Lots of good information. Calorie tracking is helpful. For me, being based in Australia when Noom coaches are in the US, the coaching aspect is stilted because of time zones differences."
1402,Sally L,"March 14, 2020",5," It's a great program, self imposed but high on accountability. Interactive. Instructive. A little goofy and fun. All at your convenience."
1403,Alex Pangi,"March 17, 2020",5, Easy to understand and use. Trains you to eat right allowing you to maintain your weight loss rather than a restricted / fad weight loss plan. Love it!
1404,Analiesa Smith,"March 20, 2020",5, Great app and program for not just logging food but learning how to make better choices! The Noom authors use humor and relavent science to guide you down the path of weight loss. I highly recommend Noom!

This program will help you learn how to have a different relationship with the food you eat and why you eat it. I have lost 17 pounds in 29 days and there is no slowing down. Exercise, even just walking on a treadmill or around the block will help you immensely in conjunction with following the steps on noom. Good luck."
1407,Amy Hillanbrand,"March 24, 2020",4, The psychological portion is exactly what I need. Love how broken down into manageable bits. Wish the step tracker was more sensitive. Seems to miss quite a bit.

1461,Elizabeth Mckee,"March 28, 2020",4, Love everything about this app but the built in pedometer. It keeps saying i walked only 4 steps when i've definately done more than that.
1462,Louise Amyot,"March 29, 2020",5, I'm loving this app...it really has helped me understand why diets don't work...it's a whole mindset change for me anyway and they make it fun as well
1463,Kevin Fix,"April 1, 2020",5, App works well. Records data correctly and with ease. Step do not seem to count correctly but you can correct manually.
1464,Mark Patton,"April 2, 2020",4," Helps a lot with mindset and self discipline. Would be improved if it could sync data with other wrist-worn fitness trackers (MiFit, etc.)"

Very happy with the knowledge and support they provide. I am getting a better understanding of why sometimes I ate the way that I did and how I can improve. Also they are open to if you don't find something in their system you can provide them with the information and it can be added to their system. So you don't always have to keep picking an item similar. Been very happy with Noom so far.
1466,Jeannie Mitchell,"April 11, 2020",5, Great program! Wish the food scanner worked as well as the Fitbit scanner. Great support. Good nutrition! Weight loss achieved.
1467,Eemma,"April 13, 2020",5, This has been very helpful to teach me how to eat and get healthier. There are very supportive coaches and members of my group when i need.
1468,Joan Cox,"April 21, 2020",5, New at this- only a week. So far find out ther easiest of it's kind that I've used. Timely information taking in current events and responsive.
1469,Betty Graham,"February 1, 2020",4," I like the program a lot. The only thing I don't like is that it is very rigid with the food choices. For example I had one slice of brioche bread which has 110 calories. The program gave me no choice but a roll, which has a lot more."
1470,Melissa Phillips,"February 2, 2020",5, I've had a lot of success using this app. They provide such great and useful information and you have a coach available to you which is incredibly het. App is easy to use and navigate.
1471,A Google user,"February 3, 2020",5," Noom is really helping me, lots of good tips to follow, keeping me accountable to my eating and exercising. Would recommend to anyone who needs help to make there goal of losing weight and knowing the reason why they keep doing the wrong things."

I live a life of body positivity and health but had been struggling to make appropriate nutrition choices. I had tried teaching with my my fitness pal for a few years but would always slide off and just not log if I started making what I saw as bad choices too often. With noom, one of the first lessons is that no food is bad or wrong, they can all have a place. It focuses on teaching the why's of our food choices instead of deprivation."
1475,Kathy Bateman,"February 14, 2020",5," Great helpers. Only problem I have is with the food log, my list is fine, but anything else is not easy to add. I am losing weight and Noom really helps!!"

1477,k t,"February 10, 2020",3, The app is great at first but the step tracker stops working and the motivation and articles seem to become boring. I'd recommend if you can keep your motivation there.
1478,Jean Denhardt,"February 14, 2020",5, Wonderful! Noom gave me the positive reinforcement I needed! Noom's program is easy and very effective. Noom presents information about food and how to change thinking and behavior in a way that makes you want to read it -- very humorous!
1479,Dena Carloss,"February 15, 2020",5," 4 weeks into Noom and I'm loving it! The app is great. Easy features to track good, great articles daily on the science of weight loss, personal coaching, and group support."

1482,Kristin Sanders,"March 18, 2020",5, Awesome app with a great weightloss program designed to change your relationship with food and lead a healthy life. So much more than just a calorie counter!
1483,Daniela Schnaidman,"March 22, 2020",1, I wrote a review but it seems to have deleted. Speaks lots about developers... Anyway... App is cute and engaging but ZERO personalised support as promised and a very average meal logging system. Very disappointing for the price.

1500,Florence Sommers,"February 23, 2020",4," Very little advise on exactly what to eat, basically healthy Calorie counting. I was hypnotized to loose weight once kind of similar in that respect. They get an A+ on keeping you motivated in making lifestyle changes."
1501,stacy williams,"February 23, 2020",5," This app is great! I've tried so many diets that have not been sustainable. This isn't a diet, it's a lifestyle change. Mentally, physically, emotionally, has changed my life in the most extraordinary way."

1576,Shari Harris,"February 12, 2020",5," This works! I have had a couple of slip ups, but get back in the saddle and on track. Teaches you a lot. I have really enjoyed using this ap."
1577,D Rivine,"February 16, 2020",5," I am on week 5 and I absolutely love Noom! It keeps me accountable, and that is what I need! The coach and my group are also wonderful! I think this 8s one of the easiest plans to stick to for me."
1578,Diana Esquer,"February 11, 2020",5, It's definitely worth the time and money. I'm seeing changes in my habits that I will keep lifelong. It's not a diet. It's an educational tool to help you understand how to be healthy and lose weight the right way.
1579,Erica Kaufman West,"February 27, 2020",5," This is a great program for people who want to understand why they eat the way they do, how to change the way they look at food, and how to improve their relationship with food.

There are personal coaches to help with accountability and funny quips to make the psychology stick. So far I'm down a few pounds in the first week and very impressed with their methods."

1581,Shannon Taylor,"March 2, 2020",5, The application has many facets to it. It is so much more than just logging your calories. The tips and personal coaching is outstanding.
1582,shanna ansley,"March 4, 2020",5," It's really in depth. Goals, food log, pedometer, daily motivation, articles, tips & tricks, recipes, a wonderful supportive coach!!"
1583,Trish Tyne Works,"March 7, 2020",5," I was skeptical but it actually works. I get to change my mindset and grow physically, emotionally, and mentally when it comes to a moderate diet for the long-term."
1584,Naomy Riley,"March 8, 2020",4, Noom is helpful for tracking your food and gives tons of useful advice on staying on track with your diet choices. The coaches are very nice and the group chats are allways supportive.
1585,Julian Mathison,"March 16, 2020",5, The daily coaching is very helpful. It would be so easy to quit if weren't for the constant 'You've got this.' The extensive information helps.
1586,Rick Davis,"March 12, 2020",1, Over priced and constantly crashes. For the price the app should be too notch. It takes several minutes and a crash or two just to log a meal.
1587,Arlene Whittingham,"April 1, 2020",5, Daily accountability which is what I needed. Everyday new insights that keep it fresh and effective. Easy to follow.
1588,Aleena Stull,"March 12, 2020",4," I enjoy the tips and tricks. However i feel like my ""goal specialist"" is actually a robot lol Pretty automated responses that give no sign of real connection or communication"
1589,Nik BrownKKD,"March 18, 2020",5," This change of lifestyle is amazing! I can feel the difference in my health (yes, after only one week!) and i have already had a decrease in inflammation from arthritis. I count it a blessing to have signed up with Noom. ❤"
1590,Melissa Ballard,"March 20, 2020",5," Noom has proven to be an effective weight loss program, because it focuses not so much on what we eat, but why. Using current, reliable literature, gentleness and humor it helps people to understand their feelings and motivations, to get to their most healthy selves."
1591,Lyndsay Hayes,"March 29, 2020",5, Best weight loss app I've ever used. The life changing tips will help me maintain a new lifestyle for years to come
1592,Martin Salazar,"March 31, 2020",4, Good app. The only issue is that a can't see my weekly exercise record. Doesn't show in the notifications
1593,J. Drainville,"April 3, 2020",5, It honestly works. It helps build healthy habits without deprivation or fad techniques. Well worth the money.

1599,Lisa Rogers,"February 14, 2020",4, My one gripe is how unreliable the pedometer is. But I track my steps elsewhere so I can at least see where I am.
1600,Dee Morris,"February 12, 2020",5, I think noom is an awesome program. It takes in to consideration your emotions and behavior as well as your eating habits. You get encouragement every step of the way and have access to a coach who's there to help.
1601,Patricia Bettinger,"February 13, 2020",5, Easy to use and great support from the Noom team. Have tried other programs but this one really teaches you how to eat for life. Other enrollees offer good advice and suggestions too.
1602,Tami Tucker,"February 23, 2020",5," Love, love, love this program!! If you have tried everything without long term success, I recommend trying Noom! It actually works!"

I also know quite a bit about healthy eating and exercise, but just hadn't managed to do it. The Noom app has really helped me stay focused and learn new healthier life habits, without forcing me to forego any of my favourite foods or exercise like a demented ferret. I've lost a bit over 2lbs in my first week - exactly as they said I would!"
1604,Steven Mathews,"February 27, 2020",5," A great way to start your weight loss journey. Noom seeks to change lifelong behavior and habits, not give a quick fix. The group chat is a great resource. If you want to improve your life, get Noom."

1607,Sharon Baker,"February 29, 2020",5, Very informative. Very helpful in understanding how and why I eat the way I do and helping me to eat healthier. I like the way it is set up and the help and encouragement I receive.
1608,Barry Wilhjelm,"February 24, 2020",5, I find this to be beneficial to help me with my weight loss program. It's a group effort that motivates you to stick to a healthy diet and to learn to enjoy eating the right foods to lose weight and keep it off.
1609,Leonie Vogt,"March 1, 2020",5," Useful app, you learn a lot of tricks to eat healthier, there is a personal coach, a group for supporting each other, I can recommend it!"

1611,Oscar Rodriguez,"March 2, 2020",4, Overall it's a great app. Would be nice to have a quick way to search nutritional info on food items without going through the log good section.
1612,Catlin Edson,"March 5, 2020",2," It wont let me create an account because ""my phone doesnt have internet connection"" even though I've tried on wifi as well as mobile network. Might be the best app ever, but I'll never know"

1615,Jaymie Estrella,"March 14, 2020",3, The scanner and food entry leaves A LOT to be desired. I'm not even sure how well it tracks calories so it's a bit frustrating to use.
1616,Melissa MacGregor,"March 15, 2020",5, Educational and informative in a light and entertaining way. This app helps to keep you on track without a limiting diet choices.

1618,Shellie Land,"March 24, 2020",5, So helpful! I have years of wrong thinking to undo regarding eating and food. I am thankful I found this app! It's a daily helper & coach for me.

While the humor can sometimes get a bit tedious it also makes reading the lessons more palatable. I've encouraged others to consider Noom. Two of these people are diabetic and one is morbidly obese. They all appear to be embracing life style changes toward the healthier side."
1620,mardi curiel,"March 28, 2020",5, It's a great program that really helps you be mindful about what you eat and how much eat without restricting your favorite foods.
1621,Renee D,"March 27, 2020",5, I like the interface and I'm enjoying using the program. The food database is vast and has more than other programs I feel.
1622,Delia Lewis Chinelate,"April 3, 2020",5, Easy to follow and really motivational. They teach you that no feed is off the menu as long as you know how to control not only what you are eating but why!
1623,Moira Forrest,"April 8, 2020",5, Steps are both simple and thought-provoking; often amusing. It's working for me!

It only allows me 1200 calories a day (not much for someone my height) and it's subliminally guilt-trippy if I go over. The stoplight system could be great if nutrition was a component. The learnings aren't able to be personalized at all so most didn't apply to my situation. The coach is the most promising part, but I've had minimal interaction so I'm not sure if it's a person or a bot."
1626,Barb Johnson,"April 12, 2020",5," Love everything about this program! It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle that is healthy and easy to follow and it comes with great support!"

1638,Natalie Neal,"February 16, 2020",3," I had more success with the program the first time around, but I'm less motivated the second time. Really wish Noom would have a desktop version since I can't use my phone at work."

1648,Jill Arlow,"March 20, 2020",4, I am really appreciating the features of this program. Only reason it's not 5 stars is logging meals could be simplified.

1696,Sarah Bruitzman,"February 10, 2020",1, Too expensive without any validation for being so compared to other apps on the market. The free trial is not free.

I tried different diets, yeah I would notice some weight lose but then I got bored ,it became too repetative and costly and you are on your own. With Noom you have support from coaches and your group, others who are just like you going through a journey to be healthier and strong ,to be in control of their own well being. Since I started Noom I have support , more energy, I,m not hungry, my clothes are loose, and yes in 2 months I lost 22 pounds."
1698,Edite Oliveira,"February 24, 2020",1," Really disappointed. I have been trying to get hold of my ""Goal specialist"" for days and nothing. Keep texting her to get some help and I have not heard from them. How are we supposed to achieve goals when there is no one to help when we need them."

When you decide to cancel after being charged $138 for the month after your free trial, they offer you a no-strings-attached monthly rate of $19/month. Why would you charge an outrageous amount of money like that if you can offer it for so little? And why do you wait until the last minute to make the offer? You're selling the idea of a healthy lifestyle being an obtainable goal for everyone, not pushing lemons on a used car lot. Do better."
1705,Alex Bäck,"March 2, 2020",1," Do not use. Canceling a subscription is made to be tricky, and you will be charged for an excessively expensive membership."
1706,June Harper,"March 4, 2020",5, This is a great way to become healthy and break bad habits. Keeps you on track. If you are really busy you can do this and lose weight and improve your health as you have everything you need right at your fingertips.

1713,Jenny Wren,"March 18, 2020",5," I've lost about 13lbs so far! Before NOOM I'd tried so many diets and apps but nothing seemed to work. With NOOM, you really get out what you put in."

1739,Carol Buhrman,"February 12, 2020",4, I have lost weight and this seems to be working. It is really vague as to how long the $170.00 is for I would like to see a contract. After the 2 weeks my card was changed but I wasn't asked if I wanted to continue. I did as it is working for me but I should have been given the choice.

I was told they would personalize the plan, but when readings went from 137 to 170s I asked them what to do and they said if i kept following the plan it would lower. So i kept trying. It went up to 180s and 190s i tried telling then i have to count carbs because it kept going up. And they said maybe i should find a plan more diebetic friendly.

1931,Inga Gritton,"February 4, 2020",5, So far my experience has been positive. I have started to lose weight! I have learned that my relationship with food has been negative. I am learning to look at food as fuel for the body. I knew this but it got lost under comfort food.

I knew my eating habits were a problem and regular diets weren't changing the way I reacted around food. Noom has dug into the psychology, physiology and sociology of why I eat what I do, that all sounds very academic but they pitch it at the general level where it's an easy 10 minute read while you're preparing dinner or having a coffee break. It makes you really think about your motives for eating, whether you're actually hungry, why you eat + much more."

1953,tina perez,"February 1, 2020",5, Noom has totally changed the way I think about food! I love this app! I lost 15lbs in one month! I am on the Noom journey to get healthy and loose weight!
1954,Pamela Pacheco,"February 6, 2020",5, Loving Noom so much!!! NOOM nerds are brilliant and somehow can pinpoint and correct behaviors while I don't even know they are doing it!!! Weight loss just happens to be a side effect to the mindset and behavior changes!!! Way to go Noom!!!
1955,Rebecca Sharples,"February 1, 2020",2," UX was poor and I hated the tone of voice. ""That sounds super exciting doesn't it?"" no, no it doesn't."

My only issue is the way they track nutrition by focusing so heavily on calories which goes against the advice of my dietitian.

The daily calories budget suggested by Noom for both 0.5 and 1 kg per week weight loss speed was of 1200 calories!

The psychology of eating breakdown is a real gift and I see how this makes Noom so much more than other programs where they give you food or recipes to follow but that's just a bandaid, Noom gets to the ROOT of overeating so we can make LIFE changes and stop the yo-yo.

This app just a meal and exercise tracker except they have an automated message system as a ""coach"" it costs over $150 per 6 months and their method of cancellation is a multi-step process in effort to try and swindle you out of your money after your trial period ends.

What this app did for me was teach me how to eat. It helped me get over my body insecurities, my fear of the scale, my binging habits, and negative self talk. If you stick with it, it works. I cannot recommend this app enough. It undid years of hurtful comments and bad habits. Thank you Noom!"

The app is not so great mainly because the food logging isn't good (which is a big part of the program). It seems like everyone you log a meal it takes you out to the beginning again. You can't log multiple meals at a time without going back to the home page first. A lot of the calories are incorrect when logging things from restaurants.

It's 45 dollars in addition to the roughly 30 bucks a month you pay for the base service. I signed up for this last week, and when I signed up as was told I would be receiving a follow up for evaluation within 2 hours. 1. 2 hours later, no email 2. I waited til the next day, sent an email to support. No response. 3. 4 days later, still hadn't heard from anyone, told my coach directly I had not received the evaluation. She sent back an auto generated response saying someone would contact me in 2 hours. Have not heard back from them. If you are going to sell an add-on at sign up, and fail to deliver on that during a FREE TRIAL PERIOD for your main service, I just can't trust they'll follow through with the rest of their service. That should be the time when you really deliver and show how on top of things you are. Be extremely careful about using this service. Waiting for my money back, not sure if I""ll get it."

I started out using the iPhone app, and I lost nearly 20 lbs before my wedding day. Then I switched to Android. The Noom app in Android just isn't as useful as the iPhone app. There are two primary issues with the Android app, both of which I've brought up with Noom support, to no avail: 1) In the iPhone app, you can save full meals for repeat logging. You create the meal, add in all of the ingredients and the number of servings, and then Noom saves the meal for future logging. The really nice thing about this is that it also allows you to see the components of your meal as red/yellow/green foods, so you can see how well you're doing with your goals throughout the day. The Android app doesn't have this feature. When I contacted support about this, I was told to simply calculate the number of calories in my meal and save it as a food item for future logging. The problem with this is that it doesn't allow you to see the breakdown between red/yellow/green foods -- only the calorie count. And it's a clunky workaround. As a result, I've turned to logging my meals in MyFitnessPal instead. This is such an intuitively useful feature (that is available in basically every other meal tracking app), and I don't know why it hasn't been added to Android yet. 2) The Noom app for iPhone syncs with Fitbit to track your step count, and then adjusts your calorie goal for the day accordingly. The Android app doesn't do this. It syncs my steps, but the calorie goal remains at 1200, no matter how many steps I take. When I asked support about this, I was basically told to reboot my phone (which didn't help)."

Group is fine but most are Jack Lalanne to my couch potato. Overall I think this is a program I will lose a lot with & also learn a lot about myself & the world around me.

It is still a ""restrictive"" diet, in that there is a calorie budget, but no food or food group is forbidden.

I have greatly improved the quality of my eating habits and mindfulness towards how and what I eat. 2) The food tracking has helped quite a bit. 3) The app itself is fairly intuitive and easy to use. Cons of Noom: 1) The tone of the writing is irritatingly positive and cheesy, so much so that I couldn't stand doing the daily lessons passed week nine and haven't done one since. It's a shame, because I probably could have learned more and progressed better if the writing was based in reality more, not the feel-good fluffy world of sunshine and rainbows. 2) The coaches are useless. My personal coach did little but ask my own questions back at me, like a bad therapist. The group coach mostly sends out feel-good fluff, which isn't helpful when you have a couple of bad weeks on a plateau. 3) The group wasn't helpful for me. I couldn't relate to almost anyone in my group, as they were all at least 30+ years older, retired, and in a completely different stage of their lives. It's hard to relate your struggles with getting in exercise when you work a full 40-50 hour week to someone that is retired and has all the time in the world. When I asked to change my group, my personal coach dodged the question for weeks and weeks until I just dropped it. 4) The weight chart looks different in Android, and can't be condensed to fully show the peaks and valleys of your wait loss. 5) The pedometer for Android isn't accurate. I often would get home after a busy day of moving around and it would tell me I only walked 70 steps. 6) It's expensive. There are other apps that allow you to track food that are free. Overall, I am grateful for the insight that Noom has given me, but wish that it was better executed. I am almost done with the program and have still not reached my goal weight, and the program's incessant positivity has made me feel guilty for feeling frustrated when I haven't done well. If the developers improved the writing, made it more realistic and empowering instead of forced positivity, that would have helped my journey a great deal. The coaches need work, mine had no positive impact and in fact had a negative impact overall. I want to stand by the program, because it really does help and work, but the app and execution needs serious work for future iterations."

They throw lots of ideas at you every day and many may not stick, but I feel I have more control over my destiny."

The app is quite good in logging meals - better than others I've used. The personal coach aspect of the app is ineffective and somewhat annoying. Beware it's hard to cancel or remove auto renewal, they make you jump through hoops to cancel."

Last week, it disconnected from my Fitbit so there is no step count happening. I have followed every step, and my Fitbit thinks it is connected to Noom. Sure wish Noom could see the 12k steps I logged yesterday. Help!"

Android users get a neutered app that does not allow recipe building as well as other features that are available for Apple users that would definetly improve the experience. Calories are incorrect on a lot of items, food calorie colors are not consistent. Cannot switch between devices (ie cannot open account on IPad and see things completed on Samsung phone)."

If I miss logging a meal, or doing the daily lessons, my coach actually texts me and encourages me to get back on track! The groups are small and friendly, unlike the local WW groups who are very impersonal and non-caring and don't even know your name after seeing you for months! I'm a happy NOOMER!"
