I am NOT a technologically gifted person, but learning to navigate through it was doable most of the time. Recently, the date on my widget does not reflect the current date. It's stuck on the date 3 days ago. When I press on the widget to move it the current date pops up. When I release it goes back to 27 (it's now the 30th). If it can't be remedied I may need to switch to another app. I utilize my phone for such info daily.l"

So because that I would have to say the calendar is ok. Now if we can just make an event ""checkable"" like something off a to-do list, were checking it of also changed the color to show completed.

On the desktop app you remove the reminders option and keep the tasks option, on the mobile app you keep the reminders option but don't have lists any tasks from the desktop version ""because there's a separate google tasks app"". Make up your mind. If you're going to have something to seperated events at the very least have them able to be viewed on both desktop and mobile. What is the point in what you're currently doing?"

After moving an event to a different day, it no longer toggles back to the day you were on. For instance, if you want to move an event from Sunday to Monday, it stays on Monday. It sounds like a small deal but it used to toggle back and now I start wondering why stuff I have done (Sunday) isn't done. Could be it is only affecting me but wanted to mention it."

I've always used this app and really rate it as extremely simple to use and as such very effective. BUT, the regular issue with it is that default reminders cannot be saved to raise a notification on the event time.... there is a way of setting up a default notification to happen 0-minutes before the calendar event (so that new calendar entries can be assigned such a notification), but this default seems to clear almost after every app update. Please fix! Thanks."

Events I create on my phone will not show in a browser, or on another Android device under my account. I have scoured the internet looking for a solution. Lots of people seem to have it, with no universal fix. So many say that ""clearing the cache"" will do it. First, I cannot find the cache on my device under that app. Secondly, in so doing, wouldn't I essentially lose my events stored on my phone. And thirdly, I shouldn't have to do this. Google, a bajillion dollar app developer, should be competent enough in their field to create an app to maximize the convenience and ease of the user experience. This needs resolved. When a task, event, etc is created on my phone, I should be able to walk over to my computer and load up Google Calendar in Chrome, and BOOM, there it is. You know, when I post something on Facebook with my phone, I can walk over to my computer and see my post. Heck, when I send an email in GMail, I can walk right over to my computer and see my email. Why is this so complicated? Why is proper and easy synchronization of services Google's proverbial Rubicon?"
10,A Google user,"April 25, 2020",5," Updated Review: Still 5 stars as I love this app, but I would love to see Tasks in my mobile Calendar as I can in the browser version, listed at their times on each day.

12,Margot Artis,"April 20, 2020",4," Good. I just have to click on which calendar I want; daily, weekly or monthly. It doesn't come up automatically as a full calendar monthly viewing, you have to click on what you want to see to get a monthly view...and sometimes that can get in my way. But, it's do-able."

The builtin homescreen widgets are stellar, the white space used is considerably large given the amount if data constantly visible.

55,Scott Martyniuk,"April 16, 2020",4, Excellent app to keep all my appointments organized. The alarms for events are very customizable and events can be reoccurring. The app working across multiple devices is very useful as well. The app however needs the return of color coding for events.
56,Michelle Miller,"April 13, 2020",5," Easy to set events. Some colors for different types of events. Weekday or weekend only events repeat would been a nice addition. Haven't found how to set times day starts and ends yet, no biggie."

However the month view is really unclear because the font and design of color display. If you look at Business Calendar app, the monthly view is clearer and if you click on the day, it will give a thumb view of today event instead of going to the ""today event"". With Google calendar you always have to click back and forth, and lose track of today. You cannot see clearly on the monthly calendar."

289,Tim King,"February 26, 2020",2," Too-often synchronization problems with non Google calendars. Per Google (device) Settings, the Calendar part of the account hasn't completed since Feb 10 (16 days ago). To be CLEAR, this simply trying to view Outlook events in the Calendar app, which is NOT not using Google Calendar."
290,Mark Crown,"March 9, 2020",1," Events more than a year out don't show up in app. This is a huge problem, we are trying to keep our calendar synced while booking weddings more than a year in advance. Huge problem, should have stuck with apple"
291,Radu Mirigel,"March 7, 2020",3, I heard Google calendar was the best in part because of the feature to create and edit your own calendars so I was quite disappointed to not find that specific feature on this otherwise polished and useful app. Hope to see it here eventually.
292,Allen Syx,"March 11, 2020",3, I just switched to Google calendar over the stock Android calendar that came on my phone. The app itself seems pretty awesome. Small complaint that is driving me nuts....the day on the calendar app is showing the 31st instead of today's date. I have to open the app to see what day it is.
293,Kunthana Kelly,"March 11, 2020",1," Because of daylight-savings, all my events, appointments, etc. are 1 hour off. And my notifications won't go off until an hour after my ""events"" have passed. I would think with the time change (daylight-savings) the app would automatically update or adjust accordingly."
294,Michelle,"March 17, 2020",4, Google Calendar app is easy to use however I would say that the issue that can be improved on is having more colour variation. There's only the current set of colours available and I find it quite a narrow selection of colours. Can adding more colours be a consideration for future updates?
295,Isaac mogane,"April 6, 2020",3," Nice and good with everything but just only one thing not working good on this app,No notification on birthdays that's on my Google contacts and I need that notification please make this app to synchronise birthdays in contacts app with notification or update it please !"

303,Andrew Martini,"March 8, 2020",4," Pretty good application. I use it a lot day to day. Holidays are useful, but could be great to drop down to a state level. Example I can see Australia's holidays, but would be nice to set 'only show SA/VIC holidays' rather than Australia wide, to see holidays that don't apply to me."
304,Mike Munafo,"March 11, 2020",3," The phone app should be following suit with the desktop version. That being said, please integrate the Tasks app into the Calendar app so that we have the option to create and place a task on the calendar like the desktop version. Otherwise good"
305,Maureen Fox,"March 18, 2020",2, You cant attach anything unless you store the item in google drive. What about adding a photo? a flyer? There are no customization or ways to add images. The interface for adding events is clunky and limited. The colors are horrid too.

Seems like a huge oversight to me and prevents me from getting the most out of the app. I've seen other people on Google support forums expressing this frustration too. I also wish I could create calendars on mobile as well instead of having to use the desktop version.

No padding anywhere which makes the calendar looks like a hot mess when there's alot happening in that month. Looks and feels more like an Excel sheet or Data entry grid than a calendar. I also Find it hard to navigate, counter intuitive and has way too much tools and features (or at least they are all presented in such a way that makes any actions seem unending)."

For example, I made a 7:30 schedule every monday until March and i edited a certain date of monday to remind me of my major exam on the class. But after I did, it just disappeared. Then I will make a reminder again. After a few days or weeks, the disappeared reminders will pop up and pile up. Can you solve this?"
1360,Albert !p,"February 4, 2020",3, I get a lot of medical appointments and this app is going to be very helpful. I like apps that actually gose to work for you and are reliable and dependable. I just got it so I'll give it 3 stars

1369,Latedra Gladney,"December 26, 2019",2, This app used to be easy peasy but now none of my previously scheduled marks are showing up. Which means my Google calendar isn't syncing. If not for my old phone who's hanging by a thread I'd be a little screwed. Will try to uninstall and reinstall the app.
1370,Alex B,"January 7, 2020",1," Google just keeps removing functionality from the app. I can't add non-gmail accounts (with exception), and Google removed the ability to choose what days an event should be reoccurring. Just keeps getting more frustrating."

1373,John Waterhouse,"February 6, 2020",4, Good. But the option to scroll vertically instead of horizontally through the weeks and months should be added

1376,Syed Nasir,"February 24, 2020",3, Syncing sometimes won't add events when there is clearly no event at that time. Clearing storage simply doesn't do anything.

1431,X Greezel,"January 1, 2020",1, Why are dates from last month and next month on the screen? It's ugly as hell.

1508,Errin Thompson,"January 16, 2020",5, Can't imagine my life without this app! Always be sure keep your calendar synced with an email account or Google account and you can access it from any of your devices. Also if anything happens to your phone all is not lost
1509,bomber plane,"February 1, 2020",5, I love this app and I have been using it for years! I'm not technical but now have a problem. I can assign a time to an event but it DOESN'T show in the calendar.

1516,Nick Baron,"December 8, 2019",1," App icon should show the current date as a part of basic functionality. That it's almost 2020 and Google has not addressed this is the reason for the 1-star. It is an OK app, 3-stars."
1517,Bernard Reed,"December 10, 2019",3, It would be nice if you could print off something like Dr appointments. I recently had to go back through appointments for my lawyers. The ability to print off that search or even my whole appointment schedule would be a great option

I cannot get the events back by clearing the cache/opening Google Calendar on PC/searching the deleted events/ reinstalling the app. While I am desperate to find a solution to fix up the issue, I see lots of people are troubled by the same issue and Google IT cannot help any of them!

Also, file attachments must come from Drive, which is a pain and requires duplicate storage if files were saved elsewhere to begin with.

Sometime in the last month or two, notifications on the phone have been disappearing. Troubleshooting it, it looks like the notification goes away once it passes the end of the event. That might make sense, but I have a lot of 0 minute events for the sake of being reminders. I could change my routine to have the events/notifications at different times but I'd prefer that notifications just stay until the user chooses to remove. Why do I do this? Because Google killed Inbox and a very effective way of including work and personal reminders that went to my phone and email. Email notifications for reminders went away with the move back to Gmail so I hopped in my time machine and started adding reminders (for personal tasks, at work I moved to another product) in a separate calendar. I need/want the ability to be reminded via email and on the phone so I can 1) be reminded and 2) get to the task when I can (snoozing email lets me drag it out until needed). For simpler tasks, I don't use the email reminder as I just need the quick reminder and do it. If that reminder comes on my phone a few minutes before the event and disappears before I see it, I have no idea the event/task came and went. (e.g. should I change my contacts) TL;DR: stop using your infinite wisdom to screw with my productivity; just let notifications sit on the device until users choose to get rid of them; why change something that wasn't broken?"

A lot, as I am quite forgetful and need something other than my brain to keep track of my schedule. I loved Google Calendar. Then you had to change it. I seem to have gotten an ""update to the update"" around the 13th - this is when I began to suffer, not on the 8th. Adding by location was totally gone, but it now appears to be rebuilding itself. And event locations are opening in Google Maps again - I really utilize that quite a bit. But the background photos. They're just gone. I loved those so much. I understand wanting to refine the aesthetic to complement your other apps. But please, please bring back those event photos. It's so depressing to just have a bunch of big red boxes.

You've removed functionality and features that helped make Google Calendar...well helped it be Google Calendar. A lot of others seem to feel the same way. Please, I beg of you: restore the functionality you've removed. Or roll the entire thing back, and offer it as an app called ""Google Calendar Classic"" or something. I'm actually distraught over this. It's lowered my quality of life. I wish I was being hyperbolic, but I'm not. I'm experiencing profound sadness over this debacle. And I'd love a dark theme/mode as much as everyone else, but please. Please make my Calendar whole again. I can't stand this. Please help me.

Some Android phone makers are smart and do that on their skin, so the app icon is useful, rather than a waste of space. P.S. Apples icon has the date on it, and has had it that way for nearly a decade, time to get with the time Google. It is pretty annoying, just had a Boost Mobile Stylo 4, it showed the true date, switched carriers to Metro By T-Mobile, same phone (stylo 4) and guess what, i guess its ALWAYS the 31st of the month on that model. With the capabilities of even the lowest end smart phones these days, I'm going to use one word too describe the fact Google doesn't have the true date on every make and model icon.........PATHETIC. Otherwise three function of the app itself is great, the fact such a simple thing is overlooked, i think its worth giving a negative review, just to catch sombre attention, and hopefully address, what in assuming would be a pretty easy to tackle task. Also explain what good it does by not showing the true date? Seriously, what good is the 31st everyday? Or ive also seen 20 as some random number they decided to roll with. I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars, once the true date shows up on my app icon, until then i would have rated negative stars if it was an option."

Due to the huge amount of events I create on my phone I only use two display formats: ""schedule"" & ""month"".

I used this app every day without problem on my iPhone (although iPhone a several other serious problems, not related, but at least my freakin calendar worked). Now every time I open this android app the calendar will freeze up, not open my events, not respond when I press on an event, when I save an event it will change the date I set and then I have to search all over to find the event and correct the date, and it often fails to sync which I didn't notice until an event I know I scheduled came to pass and when I realized I never got my reminder, I checked my calendar and it wasn't there. I use this application several times a day and I have hated it on this phone from day one. Now it's a nuisance that really frustrates me every time I try to use it (not to mention android keyboard) UGH!!!"

Can't do that any more. So when I a new tablet I downloaded the Ggogle calendar app only to find that everything is in green with no option to change it. Can't cancel anything. Absolutely of no use to me at all. So I have had to keep the old tablet just for the calendar. :-(

Edit to reply to the reply following my initial review: the instructions provide a link but when you click on the link it opens the app. When you open the browser and search for the link to open the browser version of google calendars (when you have the app installed) it automatically opens back up in the app, sending you in a continuous loop unless you uninstall the app, open the browser version to create your new calendar and then reinstall the app. Why not just have the option to create a new calendar in the app itself vs having to go through all of this or open the browser on a separate device?

I mean, okay, the app works, but it doesn't integrate nearly as well as it could with other apps. Like: adding an event from email is basically starting from scratch unless you are importing an iCal event, which then isn't linked at all to the original event. Finding local things to do and adding them to your calendar may as well be done by hand. The parsing for new events is about as good as it was in 2005 and of course there is nothing at all to replace events from G+. Oh, and it's sort of impossible to remember what program you created that task in, and how you should edit it. Keep? Assistant? Calendar? Tasks?   This leads into Google's largest failure as a company under Pachai. There are lots of great ideas/products, but there's a real lack of organization between them.

I don't need a picture of a plate to tell me I have a dinner appointment, or wedding bells for a wedding. I definitely don't need a rugby ball to tell me that I am going to a rugby match."
3821,Sam Pickering,"April 30, 2019",4," Generally good. I managed to get older events available to view in app by exporting and re-importing my calendar on desktop and then refreshing in the app, however, they are still not included in search results (only events more recent than 2018 appear). I'd love this to be fixed."
3822,Niraj Yadav,"September 27, 2018",1," The latest update is very poor. The calendar looks awkward with unusually large blocks. Moreover, the months should be swiped vertically to maintain continuity and not horizontally. Earlier version was good, but the latest one is very bad."

3825,Hafizan Thahrir,"November 15, 2018",4," I love the app. The thing that I wanted is when I use the Google Calendar widget, whenever I scroll the calendar to whatever month, the date cannot go back to the exact date that day.

3827,Jordan Deuel,"November 17, 2018",2, I don't like the new update. It's not flexible enough. When the month view is displayed you can't click on any times unless you hit the + button. It's also hard to find where to collapse the month view to see just the days events. I think it limits the app and how smooth it is.

Google Calendar pc app is very stable and have minimal problems but when it comes to the mobile app its just disappointing. The integration between Google Calendar and Google Keep in mobile is so unstable. When I open Google Calendar mobile sometimes my reminders don't popup and it DELETES all the reminders from my Google Keep account. When I clear my cache the problem is solved only for a short amount of time until it acts all weird and deletes my reminders again. Awful.

Even though my phone shows updated information from my desktop calendar. It absolutely WILL NOT synch the other person's calendar to my phone and that's the ONLY reason I have to use this calendar app. Guess I'll go back to using my Samsung calendar and physically type in their calendar events by hand. This app isn't worth the frustration.
4145,Rohit Deepak,"April 16, 2019",1, Worked well until around a month ago. Does not always show appointments - you need to close and re-open; cannot enter appointments no matter how hard you try; if you do manage to enter an appointment it does not synch it with the desktop - not sure what the fix is

Not only does it look horrendous, but it's impossible to even read anything on the calendar widget in such weird contrast with all my notes. Seriously, why reinventing the wheel when things work just fine? And why nit even consider a setting option to allow opt out of the night mode and not forcing us to use it?"
4147,A Google user,"February 17, 2019",3," Hey Google will you please add option to vertical scroll from month to month.

I use another app in addition to Google calendar, only for that feature. Also would LOVE to see the copy option show a preview of what's already on the date you're copying to, the old HTC calendar had this feature & I miss it; if you were copying something months into the future you could see a preview of that future date & time right on the copy screen, so you immediately knew if you had a conflict."
4149,Brenda Purdue,"April 10, 2019",1, I was very happy with Google calendar until 2 updated ago. the calendar went from showing all dates of the month to now only showing the current days date. Now I have to hunt and peck my way through by opening a day on the calendar to see the date. That is just stupid.
4150,Chandy K.,"October 13, 2018",1," No longer can view any events. On my computer I see my events and friends' events. On the app - nothing. I've cleared cache. Restarted. Delete google calendar app. Restarted. Now I can't see anything. There is no ""show more"" option. Help."

The app has been great when it wants too, which is about 80% of the time. The other 20% is me being frustrated by me clinking an event in order to change it and the event freezes until I restart the app or it unfreeze by itself randomly and the app not syncing to either my phone or my computer."
4152,Clare Mackay,"April 12, 2019",3," Disappointed the option to choose a colour for your events has been removed. This made it easy to see the type of things that you had on either the same day or different days. Can this be re added? Other calendars available, have this option."

4155,Richard Wilks,"June 30, 2019",3," Serviceable, but common events like Mother's Day and Father's Day are missing. When tapping an event or reminder from the widget, the calendar will enter a list of all events/holidays, which I don't like. If I tap an event, I expect it to take me to the information about that event."
4156,Brian K Sigley,"May 19, 2019",2," Suddenly, since this morning, at least that i first noticed it, I cannot add events to my calendar in my Pixel 2XL. I sync with someone else's phone and when events are added on THAT phone, it updates on mine. I can add reminders, but those, of course, don't sync. very disappointed."
4157,Amirah Abu Bakar,"November 20, 2018",3," There are 24 colors, but why only 11 are available for the event. And, why I can't choose other colors for the reminder except for the default color in the setting. Can you please fix this. I want a variety choices of color. I am sure other people want it too."
4158,tom williams,"November 8, 2018",2, All of a sudden this app is deleting calendar entries. This is brutal as who doesn't depend on their calendar app. I worked with Google help for four hours who admitted they were able to recreate this issue. They were at a dead end and had no solution for me üò°
4159,Petagay Satchell,"April 26, 2019",2," It is ok, but I can't get it to start the week on Monday. It would be nice of this could be fixed. I used to be able to have an extra widget with just one calendar on it and now I can't. All the settings keep changing on both widgets and it's rather inconvenient for me."
