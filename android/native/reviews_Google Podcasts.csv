The fact that downloaded episodes constantly buffer is frustrating, as well, and completed episodes no longer being marked as such after a certain period of time makes it extremely difficult to keep track of podcasts with large quantities of episodes. In short, it's much worse than it used to be."

It will try to buffer episodes that are downloaded, forcing me to close and reopen the app, where it often has the same issue again. Also, not automatically playing the next episode of a show is frustrating; you have to add them all to the queue. Finally, the redesigned list of subscribed shows is frustratingly small and they removed the in-progress list. Just a disappointing downgrade."

I drive for a living and am always listening on the road, so I have to wait until I can stop to play the next episode. New layout is horrible. Just looks clustered and messy. Original layout was so much better. And now, I get a robot response with a link showing me how to use the new UI. I'm not stupid. I know how to use it. The problem is it's a clusterf**k. I'll just find another podcast app."

However, after the recent update that changed the user interface, the app is borderline unusable. The homepage is a garbled mess, it is difficult to find the podcasts I have downloaded, as well as the info seeming to take up more space on the screen while simultaneously giving you less information. I had to switch to another app. Hopefully google will change the UI back, but until then, stay away from this mess of an app."

It was perfect for me to use all day at work during my 8-10 hour shifts. Low battery usage, easy to navigate my subs, easy to resume my most recently listened to podcasts, and most importantly automatic start of the next episode of the podcast I'm listening to. After the update: I can't speak to battery usage yet because I haven't used it enough, but all the other things I liked about this app are broken now. I don't want to find a new podcast app but if none of those features are coming back I guess I'll have to. I'm leaving my 4 stars for now hoping these issues will be fixed."

The new layout has turned it into a counterintuitive chore. I couldn't be more disappointed. And it no longer autoplays the next episode, so if you're trying to binge a podcast while doing something, you're stuck pulling your phone out to navigate the awful layout between each episode. This update is absolutely dreadful. Edit: Please stop condescending and read the reviews. The update is a disaster and people hate it. Your canned response is not helpful. Fixing it is. Update: I'm really sorry to delete this app because it was my favorite, but you won't listen to feedback. Podcast Guru seems to have what this app used to before you threw all functionality out the window."

It's harder to navigate. I can't find the podcasts I like as easily as before and can't keep track of what I was listening to. Update: it randomly stops in the middle of a podcast or won't play at all until I restart the phone - it keeps saying ""failed to refresh"". Bring back the Continue Listening section."
8,Kendra Hunter,"April 17, 2020",2, I was so excited when I started using this app. I loved how it would play the next episode when one was finished. Lately it has stopped auto playing next episodes.

Lately it has stopped auto playing next episodes. I tried going into settings and auto play is on. I even turned it off for an episode then turned it back on and it wont auto play still. Hope this issue gets fixed. With a podcast of 170 episodes it's a pain to have to scroll through them to find the next one to hit play. I will edit my review if this issue gets fixed.

The lack of progress and updates is pretty sad. Even with the new update, the home tab only shows newest first, while I imagine that most people would listen to things in the order they came out, meaning that I want my oldest unlistened podcasts first. Honestly it's like the people who have made this app are not people who actively listen to a lot of podcasts."

Also, recent updates have yet to fix a major bug - and it seems to be more frequent now. At random, the app will forget that I've listened to any episodes of a given podcast, and now I have to manually mark them as played again to remove them from the new episodes list."

Now I'm just unable to use it cause it just doesn't autoplay the next episode anymore. If I'm binging a podcast, I don't want to have to open the app every time an episode ends to start the next one. I really don't understand the reasoning behind this decision. I'm kinda mad I now have to look for a new app for my podcast. Please, guys, fix this."

If I'm subscribed, I'm listening to them all. I don't need a description of each episode. I'm having a hard time rolling back to a previous version for some reason also. Update: after a few weeks - still awful. It's hard to get to my podcasts and just wish they'd change it back."

For now looking at alternative podcast apps

Now the scroll at the top prioritizes the podcasts you listen to the most, so really the ones that upload the most often. The podcasts with slower uploads will lose visibility, many times these are the best as they take time to research their topic. This update is aimed to drive up engagement at the cost of good design."

Simple, clean, reliable. Since the update, it's just a top down list of episodes, w/ latest podcasts squeezed at the top. Feels cheap, and honestly it's a huge step back, unintuitive and unnecessary in it's function. I was so happy with the app. Now, unfortunately, I'm looking elsewhere."

What really bothers me, though, is that I just opened up the app today (it's been maybe a week since I last used it) and all of the podcasts I was subscribed to have vanished. I'm going to have to go searching individually for each one and add them to my account again. There needs to be a way to save this data so we don't lose it just by updating or whatever."

My favorite features of the app are as follows: The personal queue, the downloading feature, and the night timer.

The night timer is amazing because if it's a late night, and you are a little tired, turn on the night timer so you don't miss a thing"

Gmail, Photos, Keep, Books - there have been plenty of updates that I've loved right away or after a little time. But this one is not good. The previous version was objectively better. Grouped casts better together, would play the next episode automatically, had a more compact design so more important information was on the screen, etc. Then today, the app started skipping really bad until it crashed so hard I had to uninstall it. Then I reinstalled it and it kept skipping. Is it 1996? Am I listening to a CD? What gives? I ended up rebooting it seems to be going okay for now but I hope you can update this sooner than later. Thanks."

There used to be a simple grid view of icons of your subscribed podcasts that you had the ability to order, but now that's been replaced by one giant list of horizontal list of icons that you can't order and takes longer than it should to navigate. The redesign seems geared to getting people to discover more podcasts similar to subjects that you're listening to and to highlight the newest episodes in your feed. Unfortunately it's now a headache to go back and listen to old episodes of a podcast, especially for a new podcast that you just subscribed to (if you have a lot of podcasts you have to scroll all the way to the end of a single horizontal list to get to your latest subscription). I don't know if the in progress tab is there anymore, I can't find it which is a bummer. Overall this is a huge step backwards for an app that I would have given 4 stars to before. I've already submitted app feedback but wanted to rate as well."

If I had to guess your trying to make the UI consistant across programs since it resembles the YouTube UI now. This is, in my opinion, a mistake.

Now with the new one I have to pull over to the side of the road 2x on my drive to work and on my way home to select which cast I want to listen to.

I wish to mark these episodes as 'played' and not have to individually mark over 500 episodes as played. I don't have the time for that. Thanks for any help, much appreciated. I use a different podcatcher, Podcast Addict, as a main app. Unfortunately, Google Podcasts is compatible with some non-mobile phone/PC devices I own and it integrates well into hands free usage (i.e. motorcycle helmet electronics, chromecast) so I would like to use Google Podcasts but it lacks the features I like in a podcatcher. I use podcast addict. - It enables me to select x amount of episodes and mark them as played or unplayed - I can favourite episodes so I can revisit them later - I can create multiple, custom playlists - It enables me to review and comment on podcasts - I can set priorities on what I'd prefer to listen to (i.e. a new episode of x will be preferentially played over what podcast I'm currently listening to because they're my favourite podcast). Selecting x amount of episodes as played/unplayed is the no. 1 feature I want the most, however, it would be great if Google Podcasts provided more features than being a barebones application. I apologise in advance if I'm just a blind idiot who can't read and Google Podcasts already has these features. I would highly appreciate it if anyone could point me in that direction. Thanks."

Old app was fantastic, used it all day every day. Now you have to queue podcasts for it to keep playing when one finishes. The subscribed podcasts are in a tiny little banner across the top that's way too sensitive, so when you try to scroll sideways through the list, you end up activating a down swipe constantly. If tested with users, how most agreed to these changes is beyond me."

This can happen both while im playing in the background and the phone is locked and while im inside the app. there are some triggers, for example trying to send feedback always closes the app, but most of the times there is no triggers(happens both in different podcasts and not always at the same part of the podcast). Another error is that the podcast sometimes stops and displays massage ""unable to play"" or ""buffering"" even though the podcast is downloaded. This app is great and i wish those problems would be fixed so i can start using it again because now it is simply unusable."

Thank you for all the good work you guys do! I love g-suit, am an avid user of google maps, and have switched all my podcast listening to google-podcasts. However, the new changes to the podcasting platform have removed the simplicity and ease that I loved and that was the reason I switched to use the google podcasting platform to begin with. I know it's a small thing, but 1. I loved that I only saw the most recent episodes from my podcasters that I follow. 2: I seriously miss the grid view of podcasts that I'm subscribed to and the reason I miss it is because I'm constantly listening to old episodes of podcasts that I follow or newly discover. Having that grid made it easy to quickly see which podcasts I follow and which I want to draw from for my walk or my morning of house cleaning. Just wanted to pass along my feedback! Noticed others have felt the same way. Keep up the good work."

The podcasts stop all the time, and when they start to play again it's 10 minutes behind. The new layout is ghastly to the point of unusable. Queuing is fine for playing eps different podcasts but it's pretty stupid that it doesn't just default to continuing with the current podcast if you still have new eps of the same cast. I don't know why Google thinks I need to know the 'history'. The layout within Android Auto is another maze of menus and sub-menus which will almost certainly cause me to die on the road. It should be easier to look and see played/unplayed in the list. & why go from having the grid that shows new eps obviously to having to scroll across 1 line for screen after screen to see all the podcasts so that google can chuck a bunch of ads for other podcasts in 99% of the screen. It's too many steps to mark podcasts as played and there should be an option of marking all podcasts older than a chosen one read.

Also, could you please make it so we can make folders for the podcasts we're subscribed to? That way we can lump them according to category. It'd make it easier when I'm listening to podcasts based on a certain topic."

If I skip back it will play up to the same point. Today I found that if I skip ahead, it will resume playing for a while and then stop again at a new place. This happens on multiple podcasts (all of them as far as I can tell so far). I did not have this problem with the old version of the app. Sometimes I see a message about buffering, but I always download podcasts with wifi before I listen to them, so there shouldn't be any buffering going on. I've tried stopping and restarting the app and restarting my phone (Pixel 3a XL on Google FI). Again, this has been happening since the new version of the app was installed on my phone, so it's not just a single podcast that somehow was not sucessfully downloaded. I'm not crazy about the new layout either, but I'm sure I'll get used to it. This bug on the other hand is intolerable. I'll try to remember to re-rate the app if and when it gets fixed, but for now, it's terrible."

But auto-downloading, dark mode are key additions. At least on my phone, lock screen controls are now limited to pausing with skipping forward/reverse missing. I can't say for certain this is the app's fault, though all others work fine so I presume it is specific to this app. But in general, due to its robustness, linkage to the web version (including pickup up on one where you left off on the other), I'm willing to switch to Google Podcasts as my main app. There's still more to be done from my perspective, including searching within a podcast for episode, landscape support, fixing lock screen controls.

I do NOT like it. It is now really hard to navigate podcasts if you are not just looking for the most recently released episodes. I have been catching up on old episodes of an old podcast and it has now become very cumbersome to be able to go back through the podcast. I prefer the tile format where I can easily see what I have and where. I do not like that the podcasts move around and that they are now small icons. I want the tiles back. Or at least the option to have tiles. I really do not like that this is such a dramatic change with no option to have the tiles. Please bring them back! I am not going to delete my previous review, because I hope I can put the app back to 5 stars and put that review back up. A really solid app that has every podcast I have ever looked for. The podcasts are displayed on tiles and it can fit 12 tiles per page and looks really pretty. It so far has done everything I have wanted it to do and I get to listen to so many podcasts! It also works really well with casting and allows for me to fast forward the podcast on my phone and it will fast forward through my Google home."

Harder to see whats new scrolling through tiles in a single line. Way overbearing trying to display a feed type setup. Feels like they wanted to force a new design missing discussions if it was needed. This feels to me like it was redesigned by a person who absolutely boiled their system down to a set of podcasts they listen to. I'm guessing a lot of folks like myself subscribe to way more podcasts than we actually consume. I have my staples, and when they maybe don't have content I browse others and cherry pick. With this new setup everything is piled in a feed...which I think for folks beyond my initial description make it harder to find what you need.

Why on earth would I want to be forced to load a queue to play all the latest from a chosen podcaster? There's more to say but this won't let me."

It just stops every two minutes saying buffering and never goes any further until you reboot the app and then after two minutes it happens again. The problem shows itself even if the podcast is downloaded in advance which is totally inexplicable. So the app is impossible two use for its main purpose, that's why I have to switch. If the problem is solved I'll change the rating."

Usability has become awful, and loss of autoplay of the next podcast is a huge thumbs-down.

427,Chett Jones,"April 3, 2020",1," The new roll out no longer casts properly, plays the entire episode but doesn't record in the app that it has played. If you stop in the middle good luck resuming play where you left off. How does Google podcasts not work wit Google cast?!? New layout is not conducive to a good user experience."
428,Karan Dev,"April 8, 2020",3," I have always been in love with this app, now with the added features and redesign, it's only better. My only gripe is that the previous three column grid has been replaced by by a single one. It's cumbersome when you're looking for a particular subscribed channel."
429,Colleen McCoy,"April 20, 2020",1," I hate this update. It no longer allows me to rearrange my different podcasts to keep the ones I listen to most on the first screen, and it no longer automatically plays the next podcast in the series.

430,Ted G,"April 23, 2020",1," I love the design and layout but my podcasts will randomly stop playing and reset their progress so unless I'm looking at it when they stop playing, I have no way of knowing where I was. This is a pretty critical flaw and I'm not sure how it hasn't been fixed yet."
431,Douglas Black,"April 21, 2020",1," Extremely infuriating app. Nice clean interface. However, crashes all the time.

However when marking these episodes as played upon refreshing the home tab on the app previous episodes that were marked as played now appear as unplayed. I am trying to clear my Home tab hence marking the old episodes as played. Some subscribed podcasts have episodes dating back to 2017 and I dont wish to have these cluttering my home tab.

469,Elliot Wexler,"April 20, 2020",3," I have used this app since well before the new UI, and the old one was much better. It was more clean, and had a dedicated section for the newest episodes of a podcast. The new one just shows every single episode of the podcasts you subscribe to"
470,Joshua Williams,"April 19, 2020",2, This new update is terrible. I do not want to see a list of new episodes. I tend to listen to the same three podcasts for a while and then rotate to another three. It was much better when you could see all your podcasts at once. At least give us the option to go back to the old UI.
471,Dan Langdon,"April 20, 2020",1, Recent changes ruined it. They removed the In Progress section which really made it easy to navigate to an episode. The only way to find episodes now is to go through the entire list of downloads or the podcast list itself. Pretty sure I'll be going back to Podcast Addict now.
472,Cassandra Wilhelm,"April 29, 2020",1," I used to love this app, but a lot of the things I liked are gone. I miss the feature where it would autoplay the next episode.

If I'm on a long car ride, and my phone is nestled away in my console with USB connection to Android Auto, I want to be able to just let it play the next in list.

575,Dale Tucker,"April 5, 2020",1, I loved it. But the new UI is bloody awful and counter intuitive. Why they put your pods in the very top tiny part of the screen and forced you to scroll through your sometime large library to find one your looking for is beyond me. Very dumb update that ruins the whole thing.
576,Wolf3fd,"April 25, 2020",5, It is awesome! Thank you for making such a great app and putting it out for free (also ads free!). If I could wish for one more function it would be a small 1x4 widget allowing me to pause and play without having to open the app.

Before i had nice big tiles organised into order so it was easy to find quickly driving or exercising. complete shambles now not good at all.

There is no functionality to just choose to look at specific podcasts that we subscribe to from the home tab, instead we have to scroll until hopefully the one we are looking for pops up.

640,Chris Fisher,"April 15, 2020",4," The app is much improved now that you can select which podcasts to auto download, and that you can set up a playlist. However, please sort out issues with the BBC so that I don't have to use their dreadful Sounds app."

684,Chris Marchbanks,"March 26, 2020",1," The redesigned interface is more confusing. Before, I could see all my podcasts at a glance. Now, I have to open a menu, sort by subscription, and then scroll through all my podcasts in a line. It's actually more confusing and difficult to find a specific podcast."
685,Sebastian,"April 18, 2020",1," WORST podcast app I have ever seen. Completely unintuitive, terrible interface after update, almost zero settings. Impossible to backup/migrate podcasts. Unable to play error every few minutes, loosing progress. And it can ""buffer"" even with very fast LTE or WiFi"
686,Matthew Hayes,"March 31, 2020",2, This new layout is worse than the first one. A lot more clicks involved to get to my subscriptions. Previously I could view my subscriptions in a grid view which was helpful for viewing everything on a single glance. Now you have to scroll through every podcast one by one. Not efficient at all.

695,Ryan Foy,"March 28, 2020",1, If it ain't broke don't fix it. The new interface is not user friendly. There is no way to easily see my subscribed podcasts in the order I want them.

Update: I tried all of the provided troubleshooting tips and no change. Still only a couple podcast feeds are affected but some cause crashes every few minutes.
700,Rohan Jose,"April 2, 2020",4," Almost every podcast released is free of cost in this app, which is a big boon. Major con is that there isn't a dark mode available, and since I use it before I go to sleep, it can create a real hassle."
701,mark shramek,"April 3, 2020",3," Love the redesign. However, since the update all podcasts randomly freeze mid stream and I have to restart the podcast I'm listening to from the main menu. You can't get it to restart from the player. This happens on WiFi and cell service."
702,Tyler Stafford,"April 5, 2020",1, The last update is garbage. The player stops after 2-3 minutes and the buffers. Did you do any quality testing on this before you released? The primary function of a podcast player is to play podcasts and this app no longer does that. Laughable. Put out a hot fix.
703,Jonathan Martinez,"April 2, 2020",1, R.I.P to this app. With the latest update the new interface is a mess as everyone states. And since the upd ate when casting to my Google home mini after about 5 minutes the podcast stops and is unable to play or skips to another podcast on its own. Google's really dropping the ball on this.
704,Ryan Phelps,"April 5, 2020",3, When I play a podcast it randomly stops about 2 minute into playing to buffer. If I pause and then play nothing happens but if I skip 30 seconds forward then it continues to play again until it stops 1 minute later to buffer and repeat. It just started doing this not to long ago.
705,Vishrut Sharma,"April 14, 2020",3, All good. But only thing bothering me is that there is no notification of pause Play and forward when you are playing a podcast. That just makes it a little annoying to go to the app again and again to pause and play.

707,Jacob Ben-Shachar,"April 30, 2020",4," the recent updated version is OK and I like the ""playlist"" aspect of it but the thing that this app needs most is a scroll down option like google music and Spotify have so I wouldn't have to get into the app in order to pause or jump 30 seconds forwards/backwards"
708,Helen Hawkes,"April 1, 2020",3," Like the new function of being able to add to a queue, but not at the expense of auti-playing episodes of a podcast.

709,Collin Caluza,"April 24, 2020",4, Finally playlist and downloads! Though I still get thw error with incorrect episodes being pulled from NPR podcasts. Basically if you subscribe to more than one NPR podcast the 1st downloaded is played even when you are trying to play a completely different podcast.
710,Mikey Ventrone,"March 26, 2020",2," I've honestly been enjoying Google Podcasts, but the recent update changed it so that it no longer plays the next episode of a podcast when the previous episode ends. I don't want to create a playlist. I just want to listen to the next episode without having to jump through hoops."
711,Tom Palmer,"April 4, 2020",3," Can it be made so that you can choose whether or not downloaded podcasts show up in your media player? I use Play Music and I don't want them to be mixed in with my music. Also, the bubble (meant to indicate new epsiodes) keeps appearing when there have been no new episodes. Thanks"
712,Riley Goodenough,"April 10, 2020",5," Great selection, if you happen to stumble across something you like. There needs to be a tab you can go to to view categories. If that was a thing my review would be 5 stars. Edit: they added categories. Perfect podcast app"

I would give it 5 stars but sometimes podcasts stop playing before they are over. Not sure if it's my phone or the app's fault.
714,Jared Phillips,"March 24, 2020",1, Won't close audio notification once the app is closed off. It's always on.

Now I am having to search for the podcast and then the episode I was listening to the last time I was in the car. Much more time with eyes off the road now. This is just a terrible choice!"
749,Christina Orleans,"March 30, 2020",1," Broken since update. Not as streamlined and easy to scroll through episodes, but it doesn't really matter because you can't listen anymore. After listening to one episode, no matter how many times the app and phone are restarted, it just perpetually says ""loading."""
750,Rachel Fladeland,"March 27, 2020",3," I like the app but the new update/layout is terrible! The podcasts you subscribe to are not laid out in a visually appealing way, if you're listening to a series it doesn't automatically go to the next episode like it did before. And again NOT visually appealing at all."
751,Laura McMaster,"March 29, 2020",5," Update improved a lot! The auto-dowload interface is awesome, letting you toggle each subscribed pod's download settings all in one place.

The auto-dowload interface is awesome, letting you toggle each subscribed pod's download settings all in one place. Easy navigation between available downloads, full subscription list, and play queue. Good looking dark theme. I started using my old podcatcher when Google was in the middle of developing this out from its old home in Play Music, but persistent software bugs drove me to change apps again. I'm glad I checked back in on Google's progress!"
752,rob b,"March 30, 2020",2," The new scrolling layout is poor UI (don't link me to your reasoning). Some podcasts don't update (e.g. BBC More or Less).

753,Sky Dagan,"April 1, 2020",2," The new layout is complex and not intuitive. Used this app for hours on a daily basis - now it's just not good enough. I just think that adding the previous tile view in an accessible way would be great. For now, I guess I will search for other apps or use Spotify."

I have been played out on YouTube true crime channels for the last year or so. This app by far surpasses any other podcast app I've tried and it's 100% free?! Confusing how people have nothing better to do than to complain about anything and everything possible even when it's free to them?! Let alone there complaints are not factual. I've had 0 problems FYI
755,Danny Garcia,"April 3, 2020",3," Used to be good, then was great, now back to good. When it was great I could play 1 podcast, and when it was done would roll to the next in line. Now it just stops. Crashing pretty frequently as well."
756,Suzanne W Cole Sullivan,"April 5, 2020",2," The recent (3/2020) UI update is awful. It's ugly, cluttered, and no longer obvious about where my content is. The tiny thumbnails across the top aren't helpful, either. I'm just so annoyed by this update."
757,Robert Olivas,"April 12, 2020",5, Awesome last update. Having a playlist and play next finally make it worth while. Being able to continue okay in smart devices works great. My only complain is I would personally like bigger play/control buttons but it might be just me. Awesome app.
758,Randall Minghelli,"April 13, 2020",2," Meh. It seems like they have a podcast player app, just to have one. It's like they have one person who has a job that takes all their time.

759,Calvin Spencer,"April 18, 2020",5, Google Podcast allow me to keep up with the programs and issues that are important to me. It allows me to lisyen to these programs at my own pace and rwlisten when it is needed. Google Podcast is very easy to use and navigate
760,AHL CY,"April 19, 2020",1," The new interface is really terrible. I subscribed it earlier, because if its tile structure, easy to manage interface. Now I have to search through the whole list and some of my favourite podcasts doesn't appear first."
761,Ben Rochon,"April 18, 2020",1," The redesign screwed up the way I used the app. I cannot automatically binge listen to a podcast and it's harder than ever to manage my favourite podcast. For some reason, the podcasts stop abruptly and it's irritating. From a 5 to a 1"
762,Mor,"April 18, 2020",1," App crashes in the middle of the playback and the progress didn't saved. I updated the Google app twice since your support suggested it. This is unacceptable for an audio playback app, very disappointing this persists for so much time."
763,Jesse Pollock,"April 17, 2020",1," Update sucks!! It takes THREE clicks to mark an episode ""Mark as Played"". What idiots are designs this U/I??? It needs to be a SINGLE touch of screen. Second, why can't we mark an entire series as Played?!?! Unreal how bad this U/I is..."
764,Car Hogan,"April 20, 2020",5," I love All the podcast I have chosen. I just wish some of the news ones were a bit longer.. yes the app is easy to use , yes considerate of your time , but if you didn't have time you shouldn't turn it on."
765,Adam Salač,"April 23, 2020",3," Has potential, but the UI is not really straightforward. It took me a while to figure out how to cast a podcast... Otherwise it's alright, gets the job done. Also no way to add a custom podcast."
766,Nathan Comstock,"April 28, 2020",2," Why did you take away the skip forwards and backwards function from the lock screen? This feature removal will probably force me to choose a different app for podcasts. Being as I primarily listen in the car, there is now added risk to controlling the podcast."
767,Jeff Thornbrough,"April 2, 2020",1," The new updated podcast app is terrible, the UI is not as seemless as the previous version, had to change from a 5 star to a 1 star. This has to be the first product from Google that I have been completely disapointed with the update."
768,Katy Miller,"March 29, 2020",1," I was a 5 star review and now I absolutely cannot stand how you fully changed how I interact with the app. I'm sorry...why did you want to ""fix"" something so drastically that was far from broke??? Were you just bored? Can I please go back to how I enjoyed my pods before?? Bad move, guys."

773,Todd Haas,"March 26, 2020",2, Redesigned layout (March 2020) is very frustrating. I can no longer see and easily navigate to all podcast subscriptions. It's basically like if an email client only had Unread mail view. Yeah unread is a handy feature. But what if you want to go back and look at Read mail again?
774,Delia Lopez,"March 29, 2020",2, I do not like the new layout. I do not like that I cant see what new episode are available and I also dont like that the episodes do not automatically play after one is finished please change it back.

776,Todd Beckmann,"March 31, 2020",1, The new layout is terrible. Confusing system at the top and it always goes back to the beginning instead of the last tapped podcast. It used to be well organized and easy to navigate with an intuitive layout and succinct operation. Can't wait for the roll back.
777,Charlie Willis,"April 1, 2020",1, Used to work fine but After the most recent update play will cut out after 20 mins of use. Even with downloaded podcasts this happenes. I have to skip forward or back to get things going again.....then it'll cut out every 2-3 mins thereafter. I can't use it like this. New layout is not great.
778,John Riley,"April 5, 2020",1," Really loved the app. Then they updated it to a completely new lay out, and it is truly terrible. Unless they roll it back I highly recommend using another podcast app. Will be happy to change to 5 stars if they roll back to previous format."
779,Alison Cuomo,"April 3, 2020",5, The new update is such an improvement! I love being able to add episodes to the queue and listen to my heart's content! And thank you for adding the auto download function like Google Play Music had. Well done!
780,Conrad Lotz,"April 5, 2020",4, PROBLEM...Im not gonna rate it low as this is fixable Whenever I download a podcast episode and turn off my internet after about a couple of minutes the app starts ”buffering” and stops the episode. It seems to be looking for internet and not the physical download.
781,Sergey Zolotorev,"April 7, 2020",3," Well, Google has broke another good application. :( The new version has complex UI. The application removes podcasts from the playlist even if you did not listen it (just try to play to switch to an another podcasts and you will loose the current one)."
782,Ben Wheeler,"April 7, 2020",1, The new layout is horrible with no option to revert. Podcasts are listed in chronological order instead of listed by podcast then episode. I have to search by icon instead of label now. And since the update I get buffering and crashes like never before.
783,Purdey Go,"April 11, 2020",5," Great so far. Big improvement from last update. Queue feature, downloaded podcast, settings (and dark mode) are all great improvements. I would prefer the home page top banner to be organized based on my priority of podcast subscription."

787,Oliver Allen,"April 12, 2020",5," Good app. Does what I need it to do. Only criticism is that it's very easy to go to the episode I was last listening, but seems fidliy to go back to the main list of episodes of a particular podcast. Maybe just me."
788,Craig Snaer,"April 15, 2020",2, Used to be great until most recent update. Podcast now only play a few minutes before they stop and show buffering and never play again. New interface is terrible. Old interface was way better and easier to understand and navigate
789,Zack Shepherd,"April 22, 2020",5, I like the app a ton. The option to speed up podcasts by x.1 increments is a really neat feature along with night mode! It could be a little easier to navigate (see competitor app rhyming with hot-i-pie) but it is a very solid app!
790,Alexis Rene,"April 21, 2020",5," I have heard apps like pocket casts automatically tailor podcasts to you based on ones you listen to, if Google could integrate that because I love it, that would make it even better. All in all though Google Podcasts is really clean and amazing."
791,Stanislav Petkov,"April 24, 2020",1, I'd like to see the tabular dashboard back...the top screen podcast scroll function is less efficient. Users should be able to switch interfaces. Please bring back the old dashboard with manually modifiable favourite podcasts AND allow more podcasts to be added per page!
792,pranjal thakur,"May 1, 2020",4," Nice app with huge collection of podcasts. For some of the podcasts which have very slow paced speakers you can also use custom speed. Also, the feature to remove the silence in podcast is very nice as it cuts off the silence."

795,Mateo Pantoja,"April 18, 2020",3, Update as of 4.17.20...hate the new layout. Went from 5 stats to 3 stars..... And declining by the month. Scrolling one line of all my podcasts is inconvenient. Just does what I need. All my podcasts in one place. Easy to use.
796,Mark Storey,"April 18, 2020",4," Great app, but very confused as to why BBC podcasts have suddenly disappeared from it. They're on other podcast apps but not this one anymore. Otherwise I love the app and don't want to switch away just to get certain podcasts."

799,Jefferson Moore-Bellerande,"March 12, 2020",2, It's a good app but missing simple features . The fact that there isn't a play only on wifi feature is bad. Too many times when you are playing from downloads it will automatically play the next episode even if it wasn't download and consuming your data. Also needs notifications for new episodes
800,JNK117,"March 26, 2020",1," Cannot remove from notification bar unlike YouTube, YT Music, or Google Play music. It just sits there, constantly in my notifications.

808,John O'Sullivan,"March 30, 2020",2," I loved this app. Recommended to others. But I really dislike the new layout. Why is there not an optional button to see the old layout, where I could more easily browse all of the podcasts I subscribe to? You've taken a very user-friendly UI and made it much worse."
809,Curtis Watson,"March 31, 2020",2," The UI is simply not good, you can't see much on the screen at a time so expect to be scrolling a lot to find anything you're looking for. There seems to be no casting function which is bizarre. You cannot customize how many episodes are auto downloaded."

You can not easily browse your own podcasts as they are now shown in one row only so if you have subscribed to 30 podcast, then good luck getting to what you need looking into icons only ..."
834,Christian Jenkins,"March 13, 2020",5," Great app, easy to navigate and find similar podcasts to the ones in already subscribed to. It would be good if they had a notification popup when a new one is available as I sometimes forget to look in the app and then I have quite a few to catch up on."

Some of my recommendations include: dark histories, true crime salad, deadtime stories, secret societies, sword and scale, female criminals, midnight facts for insomniacs; these are just to name a few. Still there is much, much more! So give them all a listen and enjoy!"
836,Shan O'Byrne,"March 22, 2020",5," Great app, I haven't tried many podcast clients but I love the speed scaler instead of speed presets. Dark mode would be nice. For podcasts, it's much better than Spotify, for various reasons. No bugs that I've seen. Sometimes the menus are a little odd. Thumbs up from me"

When I do the same search in this app, ""Ben Shapiro is Wrong"" shows up at the top & the actual show is not on the list. It has all kinds of other podcasts until I type in ""Ben shap"". Then it finally shows. Either Google is burying the show or their algorithm isn't very good."
838,Allison Fenner,"March 26, 2020",1," This app was fine until the most recent update, which seems to have killed the autoplay feature. Now each episode has to be started manually. Super frustrating! Also the updated interface is clunky and bulky, and makes navigating episodes a hassle. What a disappointment."
839,Sie Morley,"March 27, 2020",1," i used to use this to manage my library of hundreds of podcast subscriptions but today's (3/27) update has made the the app utterly unusable. gonna have to find something else to use, which is a total pain in the ass because i've been such a long-time user"
840,Ryan Sedgwick,"March 28, 2020",3," This new interface is a convoluted mess. Can't organize the podcasts, it's a chore to go back and listen to podcasts you've already started, what was once streamlined and simple to navigate is now annoying. Also, it can get buggy when using with Android Auto."

842,Ethan Fillmore,"April 2, 2020",1, Great...until new look! I loved using this app to listen to all the podcasts I follow; however this new update is awful. It is the opposite of user friendly. I would love to see the old interface come back.
843,Vini Ackerman,"April 5, 2020",1," After latest update everything is a mess, still lacking option like import podcast from other platforms, and for the love of God make it an indepent app from the main google app, also a way to change your region would be usefull since I listen to a variety of podcast."
844,aksh296,"April 3, 2020",4," The podcasts available are really good, but the dark mode seems to go off after a while of listening to any podcast episode, that sucks a bit, but hope Google fixes it soon, before people give it bad ratings for the same reason."
845,Jay Jethwa,"April 6, 2020",1, Hate the new interface. More scrolling needed to find what I want and then you accidentally refresh....back to where you began. Revert back to the large icons Google. That's what made it so easy to use
846,Omar Sanchez,"April 6, 2020",1, New update is more cluttered and not as organized as it used to be. Removed autoplay from within one podcast. Adding it to que each time is more work and only is useful when listening to multiple podcasts at once. Removed in progress tab as well.
847,Kyle Pruett,"April 5, 2020",1," This was my favorite podcast app, but the new interface is terrible. A great app experience changed into a cluttered one. Please consider going back to the previous interface or try something different than this."
848,Aniket Kulkarni,"April 6, 2020",1," Awesome, although, app closes while playing the podcasts randomly. Fix that please, it is annoying especially during workouts. This is getting annoying. Reducing to 1 star. I already have already cache, data and what not."
849,Sandra Lloyd,"April 10, 2020",1, this app was easy to use when I first downloaded it it is now cluttered difficult to navigate and it has stopped playing episodes continuously so I have to go through this clutter difficult to navigate to find the next episode in the same podcast and very unhappy with this so-called update
850,Clinton Schena,"April 8, 2020",1," I hate the new interface. It was way easier to locate my podcast on the previous one. Also it constantly buffers after a couple minutes then says ""unable to play"". I deleted the app and redownload it and nothing was fixed."
851,Randy Mewes,"April 26, 2020",1," The update eliminated the ability to automatically start the next newer episode when binge listening. I now have to open my phone, hit play on the newer episode. Older version was great. Installed the Sticher app and am using it now."
852,Ace Puzzler,"April 26, 2020",3," Honestly I barely review but I hated the new update because of one single thing. When you click on an episode and it finishes it doesnt go to the next episode like it used to, and I dont see how to fix this in the setting either"
853,Matt Haire,"April 21, 2020",1," Worked great. Updated and now podcasts are constantly ""buffering"" or ""unable to play"". It just became not worth it. Disappointing. Deleting and moving on to a new app."

855,DeeJae,"April 27, 2020",2," Night mode is great but the interface is too chaotic. Very little opportunity to have things organized. Home button should have all your subscribed podcasts, then you can view the episodes after clicking on it."
856,Amar Kantipudi,"April 28, 2020",1," Terrible update. Previous version of app was great... new UI and functionality is a huge downgrade. Harder to sort through my podcasts now, no longer autoplaying next episode. Please revert to older version or at least give option to autoplay next episode."
857,Varun Kalpurath,"April 30, 2020",4, App for podcasts. Just plain and simple. No extra features which is what I was looking for.but new interface looks very cluttered than old. Always easy to click on thumbnails to view the channels rather than scroll through clutter
858,A Google user,"April 20, 2020",2, Ok so you made it pretty but we lost moving to the next track when a podcast is done but there are still more episodes to listen to I can no longer just hit next on my headset I have to open the app and manually and select the next one.
859,Tiffany K,"April 20, 2020",1," I really don't like how they changed it. It doesn't just play the next episode after one finishes, it forgets my queue list constantly, and the layout is not user friendly anymore."

Or is it because of Android version is below 9?)"
861,Desiree Jones,"April 5, 2020",2, Ugh. I'm so sorry but i'm also editing my review from 5 stars to 2 stars. this new interface is awful. Not an upgrade at all. It's understandable to use but definitely not as user friendly. Is there any way to still use the old interface?
862,Timo Majoor,"April 2, 2020",1," My god what did you do to the UI :O It was sooo much better before. The new queueing features are most welcome, but the home page is awful now :/ I was so looking forward to switching from Pocketcasts to Google Podcasts, but i'll wait for another UI change I suppose."
863,Shreyas Lingadahalli,"April 14, 2020",1," Why does Google has to destroy everhting that is good. This new update is terrible. For starters, it does not automatically play the next episode. The interface is also very bad."
864,ANIRUDH SUNDAR,"April 16, 2020",5," With the new update. I'm not even able to sign in. There is no option to select an existing account and if I press sign in, it asks me to enter the email address and then says this account already exists in the device."
865,Nick Covington,"April 6, 2020",2, Yikes. After the newest update episodes only play for a couple of minutes at a time and then pause for no reason. The only way to continue is to fast forward the episode. Incredibly annoying.
866,Justin Reinwand,"March 10, 2020",1," I still cannot auto download new podcast. To me, this is utterly unacceptable as this should be a basic feature pod cast players now. Other than that, it's not bad. Still nothing. Come on Google, trillion dollars and can't do something basic."

Somebody please guide me how to rollback this update.
868,Michael Mappin,"April 4, 2020",4, What happened to the grid format? I had originally given this app five stars. Now all the subscriptions are in a horizontal line at the top of the screen. Takes me way too long to scroll through them all.
869,Liam Murphy,"March 6, 2020",4," Really good podcast app. So many subtle features like replaying 3 seconds behind where you paused. A button to download podcasts. Previously listened to icon, so you can see how much of a old podcast you have already listened to. Perfectly timed fast forward and rewind intervals."
870,Rick Smiley,"March 11, 2020",3," Thought this would be a good replacement for PlayerFM but there is not an option for Automatic Download. If there was an option to automatically download new episodes from Subscribed Podcasts (with or without WI-FI) this would get 5 stars. Oh, and maybe a Dark Mode."

872,Keith Head,"March 17, 2020",2, This app blows podcasts work sometimes and could take a few days to be fixed for listening. Running into a problem now where one of the podcasts I listen to even though downloaded buffers when it shouldn't. Currently searching for a new app that offers the same content I listen to with this app.
873,Chris Patrick,"March 25, 2020",1," Used this app for a year or so, the user interface was terrific! Was a 5 star, Until they F#$ked it all up this morning! So ridiculous now! The UI is so bad now! Change or updates are one thing, this is another. Don't bother with it now!"
874,Jamal Felton,"March 29, 2020",5, I'm giving this a five with the new update. I love the ability to use the dark mode now along with the other updates. Unlike other reviews I haven't had any issue with Android auto playback. In fact it's much better than before. Best of all are the auto download and updated player tab features.
875,Collier Faubion,"March 28, 2020",1," The app used to be great, but a recent update changed the way you view/manage your casts and forces you to look at only the most recently updated. For folks who listen to a lot of different podcasts, this interface will make the app unusable."
876,Ray Barrett Marble,"April 5, 2020",1," Used to be good but latest update is buggy. New layout is harder to use and podcasts randomly stop every couple of minutes and endlessly buffer, even when they are downloaded to my phone. Guess I need to find a new podcast app."
877,Mitchell Jeppson,"April 3, 2020",2," Ever since the new update on March 19th I haven't been able to play a few of my podcast. They just sit there buffering forever. I also don't like the layout of the new update on March 19th, 2020. Please fix it Google."
878,Åłlïşôņ E,"April 7, 2020",1," New update makes no sense whatsoever, the new layout of the app is completely disorganized, non intuitive and unappealing. Yet there is still no option to save past episodes in a separate locaton or add individual episodes to a queue. SUPER LAME!"
879,Benjamin Valkenburg,"April 11, 2020",1," The new design has taken this from a simple player to a mess. The auto download is a nice feature, you just have to revert to the old setup and fix the playback issue and the stars would increase."
880,Jason Couto,"April 8, 2020",4," Love this podcast app, new features allow for auto download of new episodes. Best feature is the ability to create a play queue. Would rate it 5 stars if it had the ability to save to SD card."
881,Jon Moen,"April 17, 2020",1, The new design is horrible. You made an ok interface almost impossible to use. Please go back to the previous. I am normally a Google everything. Until there is a redesign I am going with a different app.
882,Apoorv Dubey,"April 19, 2020",1," The app introduced the much needed dark mode, but has a bug. Every time I push the app to the background, no matter what theme I have selected, it shows the light theme. Gets very annoying at the night to use the app."
883,Grim Reaper,"April 20, 2020",5," Great app, fantastic range of podcasts, something for all tastes. Really enjoy listening to my favorite poeple having a laugh and great conversations. Recommend giving this great app a go. Keep up the great work. Cheers Gerard"

885,Kaio de Paula,"April 29, 2020",5," Simply amazing. Been listening to podcasts from more than fifteen years, earlier than using smartphones. This perfect union of podcasts and Google's Android, not depending of a 3rd party app is just indestructibly satisfying."
886,Darren Paredes,"April 30, 2020",5, Great App for listening to podcast. I love that you can subscribe and add episodes you want listen to later. You can see completed episode and speed up episodes. You can trim silence from the episode too.
887,Julián Suárez,"April 29, 2020",5," Great app but I suggest a small UX improvement, the cast button should also be present when playing an episode. I spend a lot of time searching the right episode to listen but then I have to go back and cast to my Google Home"
888,Raghu nandan,"April 25, 2020",1," Why would you need to change the UI at all, when it was so good. Please revert to previous one. Would have given 5 stars. I have recommended google podcast to so many people who are now hooked into it. Even those using iOS"
889,Patrick Kent,"March 28, 2020",1," I'd been a big fan of the app until this new layout. The grid view and the ability to order podcasts was convenient and intuitive. Unfortunately, the new one requires too much scrolling and podcasts that I listen to rarely are showing up at the front."
890,Kelly Davis,"March 25, 2020",5, Great way to get podcasts. It would be nice if downloaded episodes didn't automatically move to the next episode. It would also be good of we could set up a playlist. Update: recent version allows for setting up a queue. A great addition!

To make it 5/5, I would prefer some additional features: - history log of played pods - dark mode - subscribed list more functional (current grid swipe is nonsense - cumbersome design) - sharing, URL shortened- they're far too long for tweeting/SM."
895,Peter Wells,"March 25, 2020",2," Recent has an awful user interface. Listing all episodes, with descriptions, of all subscribed podcasts in the primary app interface is the opposite of helpful. App has no options to remove or prioritize this list. I will either install the previous version or migrate to a different podcast app."
896,Alan Wills,"March 25, 2020",5, Latest UI update I think is excellent. Being able to queue podcasts is something I was really hoping!

898,Meggie Higby,"March 28, 2020",1," Everytime I connect to my Google Home the last podcast I was listening to starts, then the app crashes and does not let me reconnect. This means I cannot use my phone to pause, rewind, or control the volume, or play a different podcast. This makes the app unusable."
899,Emily St. Germaine,"March 29, 2020",1," Loved the old app. This redesign makes it very hard to see which podcasts are new and available for download, which ones I've already downloaded, and the new home screen provides less overview information. Pls provide a setting to show just a list without the descriptions I never read."
900,Davin Litke,"March 31, 2020",1, The last layout was so much better. Went from listening to a podcast with many downloads and being able just to let play one after to another to having to make a playlist. Than if that wasnt bad enough now most podcasts I listen to seem to buffer after 10 to 15 seconds after playing.
901,Lily Tonellato,"April 5, 2020",1, Plays a podcast for 2 minutes and then stops. Forced to play a different podcast and then go back to the original one I was listening to. Have switched to a different app because this was too annoying.

905,Jamie Kerle,"April 8, 2020",1, Infuriating poor app Does not play downloaded podcasts without signal. Constantly needs to buffer even when have good enough signal to stream video content. Much worse than apple podcasts. Why is it so hard to find a podcast app that works well on android.
906,Rob Wilkes,"April 11, 2020",2," Used to be a great app but since the update I now have to put podcasts into the queue before it will play them. Before, it would automatically start playing the next podcast which was great when driving... This is just really annoying 😡"

926,Daisy Moreno,"March 31, 2020",1, I would give this application 5 stars but since they've completely changed the layout everything got confusing. The new layout makes it difficult to find where you left off on your previous episodes. I really hope they go back to the old layout.
927,Jade,"April 1, 2020",1, I use to LOVE google podcasts because of the layout and how I was able to see a lot of my subscribed podcasts at once and flip through them. Now it only shows 5 at a time and is terrible!! I'll be looking for a new podcast player because of this redesign.
928,Mike Kriz,"April 1, 2020",1," The customer response here is appalling. A significant number of users are complaining that subscriptions are harder to manage (myself amongst them), and the best you can do is reply with your rationale for making the app worse?

A significant number of users are complaining that subscriptions are harder to manage (myself amongst them), and the best you can do is reply with your rationale for making the app worse? When real users are complaining about the UX, *your rationale does not matter.* Actual user experience trumps developer intention ten times out of ten. I'll keep an eye on this app to see if it ever gets fixed, but until then I'll be getting my podcasts elsewhere."
929,Colman Doering,"April 2, 2020",3," It works well, runs fast, and looks nice, but at random times it will turn my WiFi and Bluetooth off. It only happens with this app, but it might be my phone. I'm not sure."
930,Duy N,"April 5, 2020",3," New updates are not ready to use. Also, can have this integrated with Google music or the player somehow. I have listened to podcasts on Google music on the past, but I like the separation. Please consolidate, and make a player widget for podcasts"
931,Marc Webb,"April 7, 2020",2, Used to use this all the time now it won't play more then a minute of a podcast without stopping and saying it's buffering and you end up having to skip forward to get the podcast to continue. Tried reinstalling with no success.
932,Zach Dominguez,"April 6, 2020",1, It was a great so until the update. It's no longer easy to navigate and getting rid of the In Progress feature Shane make sense. I'll be switching back to the podcast app I was using before.
933,Jeremy Dollar,"April 13, 2020",3, Giving 3 stars because I dont like the new layout of where my subscriptions are located. I like having a separate page with bigger icons instead of smaller icons at the top that's also hard to reach one handed with a bigger phone(S9+).
934,Martin S.,"April 11, 2020",1," It's an useless app, as one cannot subscribe to a podcast via podcast-URL (RSS feed) :-( Had to uninstall it again and switch to another app. Additionally, one has to install the latest version of the ""Google"" app."
935,Gabriel Carrasco,"April 8, 2020",1," Since the late March update with the new UI, podcasts that are downloaded constantly pause to ""buffer"", even though they're downloaded. Takes forever, with much frustration, to get through an episode."
936,Xudong Chen,"April 10, 2020",4," good start - no ad! need option to prioritize play list, such as by time added, by time published, by time downloaded, by weight..., or by manual manipulation. need option to auto download only when on wifi to save data usage."
937,Miranda LaShell,"April 19, 2020",1," I didn't think the UI could get worse, but oh boy was I wrong. The latest update is horrid, just seems like random, unhelpful lists of my podcats. The only positive that came from the update was queueing."
938,Taylor Chafe,"April 27, 2020",1," The new UI is the least efficient system I've seen on an app since 2011. They had a clean useful interface and completely scrapped it for a messy, ugly system. If you aren't already using it, stay far away"
939,Caitlin Popodi,"April 28, 2020",4," I only recently got into podcasts but i really like the setup that Google podcasts has. Plus it streamlines in with the rest of my Google account, which is, of course, the point."
940,Ron Turner,"April 30, 2020",5," Easy to Use. Can search for, find and listen to many different podcasts all in one place. Can download to listen to when Internet isn't available which is also helpful."
941,Robby SlipCut Perkins,"April 29, 2020",5," Works well. Doesn't have errors or ads lol. Limited in customized settings, but having something that functions well, as designed, takes precedence. Sometimes, simpler is better."
942,Joe Olejar,"April 9, 2020",5, Google Podcasts works better than any other app I've tried. i have yet to search for a podcast and not been able to find it. The podcast directory must be updated very often as one just started on our local NPR station appeared before the second episode was posted.
943,Namka B,"March 28, 2020",1, New update is terrible. This would have been great if I only subscribed to 5 podcasts and listen to each and every episode diligently. But I'm pretty sure most people don't. And this is coming from a huge G podcast app fan. Changing my 5 stars to 1 star.
944,Eric Todd,"April 6, 2020",1, They changed the layout and now it's worse. It used to show you new releases in a box but now it's just a big steam that doesn't tell you what you have or haven't listened to. Horrible update
945,Alexandra Egli,"April 1, 2020",1," Really don't like the new layout, it's harder to see the podcasts you have favourited and what's in progress or downloaded. Autoplay no longer works, at the end of each podcast it just stops, which makes it really annoying to catch up on podcasts."
946,Austin,"March 27, 2020",2, new update has a slightly worse interface. More difficult to find your downloaded Google also seems addicted to making everything into a queue. Forces install and update of Google app. Not cool. No option for storing downloads on external micro sd card. But it's responsive.
947,Glafe Montiel,"March 11, 2020",4, Really nice but I would love if there is an option to normalize volume. I know that creators should normalize their content but that's not always possible and some content have really low volume so it could be a great differential with other podcast apps to have this feature.
948,Soda Pop,"March 25, 2020",1, The new layout is truly awful. I had all of my podcast organized in a grid pattern the way i liked it. Now the podcast lists are in a straight line hard to see and organized based on the apps choosing. No good very bad. Please change it back or give option to change back
949,Daniel Bachiu,"March 27, 2020",1," The redesign of this app is absolute GARBAGE. Very poorly organized UI and they present old, already listened to episodes of podcasts right next to the brand new episodes which is unnecessarily confusing. There was zero problem with the previous layout and yet they RUINED it for no reason."
950,Walter Torres,"March 29, 2020",2," New update sucks! Getting rid of the grid has made it harder to find anything, it's a mess, just because I'm subscribed to something, doesn't mean I'm ready willing and able to listen to the latest podcast, sometimes I look for older podcasts"
951,Dan Jauncey,"March 28, 2020",1," Sorry Google I am going to have to uninstall this app after the latest update, I honestly really hate it. Have loved this app for a long time but it is just totally confusing now. Will use a different app for a while and check back in coming months to see if things improve."
952,Tim Yates,"March 27, 2020",2," What in God's name have you done to the app. It used to be the best around, but since the re vamp it's totally un navigable. Please put it back. Auto play no longer works, I cannot go to the episode playing in the list format. Just terrible."
953,Jennifer Tunez,"March 27, 2020",3, They made changes in the app recently that I am really not happy with. They've made everything a smaller list view that I find really uncomfortable to navigate now. I am considering deleting it but I don't want to get used to another app so I am going to try and see if I can get used to it.
954,David Miller,"March 29, 2020",1," Since the new update, my podcasts will stop and buffer for eternity every minute or so, even when I download them into my phone. Very annoying, the only way I can get them to continue playing is by skipping forward and then rewinding back to where I left off"
955,Mariusz Lon,"March 30, 2020",3, This is a shortcut to the Google app and so is the Assitant app. In order for voice assistant to work while connected to the cars Bluetooth the Google app's sound has to be rerouted to the phones speaker. By doing that the podcasts also get rerouted and no longer play via Bluetooth.
956,Ivygreen 62,"April 2, 2020",1," New to this app - but not a fan of the generic Google responses below. How dare you redirect users to a list of rationales for the changes. Are you even listening to the complaints?? Ironic, a podcast app yet the developers do not know how to listen.."
957,Richard Levett,"April 2, 2020",1," This app design is not as good as it was, more confusing, too much text & now not available in my notification shade. The suggestions algorithm, everyone knows is terrible, unfortunately. A shame ! Kind regards Richard U.K"
958,Joseph Johnson,"April 5, 2020",2," It was ok, the changes made it very annoying to browse subscribed podcasts, which is a basic requirement. Maybe they will restore this feature, but not in time for me. See ya!"
959,Sean Morris,"April 7, 2020",1, Episodes constantly stop and buffer. This app is now useless. You also changed a great layout to be confusing. My partially played episodes keep being deleted even though I've selected not to delete at all. Please fix this!
960,Gabriel Austin,"April 12, 2020",2," Used to work fine, but after a patch update to fix a ""bug"" in April 2020, I can't use it. Constantly buffering when I stream audio over my wireless network literally all day."
961,Manda Johnston,"April 20, 2020",2, Worked fine until the update. New layout is clunky and difficult to use and find anything. The update also lost the info on podcasts I'd listened to. It needs a download over wifi only option.
962,Sanjivanee Borse,"April 25, 2020",3," Good app overall but I don't understand why downloaded episodes buffer, it's very annoying when something is already downloaded so I can have an uninterrupted listen but it keeps pausing every few seconds to buffer."
963,Jared Forsgren,"April 21, 2020",1, New interface is awkward - everything is crowded at the top and it's hard to find what you are looking for if you've subscribed to many podcasts. Very awkward to use on mobile.
964,Aaron Frost,"April 23, 2020",2, Apparently this is the only way to report an issue but the app stopped refreshing about a week ago and won't update new episodes anymore. I tried reinstalling the app but that didn't help.
965,Stephen Jones,"March 26, 2020",1," One star since the update. The layout was perfect, I I select which podcast was one what page. Now I have to scroll infinitely through the podcasts in an order based on whatever? I'm a truck driver and now I have to stop to change podcasts. Y'all must want people to use another app."
966,Matthew Montoya,"April 6, 2020",1," Has everything any other past app has. DO NOT LIKE THE NEW LAYOUT. Much harder and time consuming to scroll through my subscribed podcast. Otherwise, it's fine. I'm an changing to 1 start sure to the new layout."
967,Mike Gibbons,"April 21, 2020",4," Really wish you would make it easier to browse our list of subscribed channels. Having to scroll along one line is really slow and if you click on one and then return to the list, it brings you back to the start again 😠"
968,Ian Ng'ang'a,"April 4, 2020",2, The new interface is horrible. The navigation is a mess as well and I've just noticed that the option to resume a download is nolonger there. If I switch from using WiFi to mobile data today I can't resume the download. Fix please
969,Adriel Colón,"March 27, 2020",4, It's getting better with the updates. Thanks for adding up-next playlist. Still missing things like : -Auto downloading up-next playlist. - Easy way to mark as played / Mark as unplayed. (Not one by one.) -Better interface for organizing the subscribed podcasts.
970,Jeff Seely,"March 9, 2020",4, The app does as advertised. There is a broad library to choose from and it has many of the features that I like. I would like to see more features like automatic download. This app is my primary way to listen to pods and appears to be bug-free...
971,Meshon Cantrill,"March 11, 2020",5," I just recently moved and was looking for a way to ""enjoy"" the longer commute. I've been using the app to discover some great podcasts and being able to use voice to switch, start, and stop is great while I'm rolling!"
972,Jesus Mario Nava Gonzalez,"March 29, 2020",5," Amazing! You listened!. After giving you my negative feedback. I'm amazed you developed those features that makes this app transition from ""podcast app..."" To my go to app to listen and stay update with the latest chapters of my favorite streamers, even notifications are very much appreciated!! Keep...Full ReviewAmazing! You listened!. After giving you my negative feedback. I'm amazed you developed those features that makes this app transition from ""podcast app..."" To my go to app to listen and stay update with the latest chapters of my favorite streamers, even notifications are very much appreciated!! Keep it going team!"
973,Jim Velasco,"April 1, 2020",1," Horrible layout since the last major update. Additionally, podcast episodes that are already downloaded still require buffering. Doesn't that completely go against the reasoning for downloading in the first place? Any cut & paste ""rationale"" for these is utterly and completely irrelevant."
974,Shivati Starr,"March 27, 2020",3," There's something wrong with the audio since the update. I can barely hear it now. The new interface will take a few days. The old one was okay, but the new one isn't clear weeks I've watched and what's in the queue. Anyway, please fix the audio."
975,Armen,"March 28, 2020",1, Pleaaaaase bring back the old layout. The new layout is just nonsense!!!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely hate it. To select the new subscriptions I have to scroll to right side too many times and overall the new layout is not good at all.
976,Greg Probst,"March 31, 2020",1," The new interface is terrible. Difficult to navigate. Instead of being able to auto-play episodes of the same podcast, you have to add everything to a queue and control what you want to listen to next. Horrible decision!"
977,Armando Cortez,"April 1, 2020",1, New Layout = Frustration. I'm a new user and picked Google Podcasts for ease of use with the previous version. Within days of using the version it changed to a bad design. Please bring back the previous version... I'll start looking for a new podcast in the meantime.
978,Hadas Levmore,"April 1, 2020",2," I don't like the new version. It doesn't play the next episode automatically unless you manually build a queue! Also, the icons are small and are displayed in only one row instead of utilizing the entire screen. Very annoying."
979,Christopher Madsen,"April 3, 2020",1, New design and lost subscription. With the new design I lost all my subscription to all the podcast I was following. This with the new interface that is not user friendly is the result of the one star.
980,Leviticus H,"April 6, 2020",4, Works great for podcasts when I'm at work . Edit I am not a fan of the new interface... at all... its terrible. But it is still reliable to use just more cluttered than it needs to be
981,Kym Robey,"April 6, 2020",2," This was really great but now with the new design, I can't see my podcasts as easily as they're really small, and I still haven't figured out where to find new podcasts since the changes."
982,Kenny Rogers,"April 6, 2020",1, Terrible change. I absolutely hate the new layout. It's impossible to see the new episodes and the ones I've already listened too. I'm now searching for a new player. Probably Pocket cast.
983,Matt & Kaidee McKerrow,"April 9, 2020",1," Terrible layout, old version was much better to use. Now it's just a cluttered mess and needs lots of scrolling to find stuff. Also some podcast freeze after 3min. And will not continue to play."
984,Anand Krish,"April 16, 2020",3, Ruined the entire organizational capabilities and just slaps ur face with a list of ur subscriptions. Shows only a limited view of the transcript. I personally would like to read the transcript before I actually listened to some some podcasts.
985,elibin100,"April 25, 2020",2," It used to work OK. Since yesterday, When I tried to download an episode for offline use it doesn’t load. I get a red circle with an exclamation mark in it."
986,Barbara Martin,"April 25, 2020",1, Used to like the app but after the last update it is now awkward to navigate but the worst thing was I lost all my downloads. I will now find a new app as there are plenty to choose from.
987,Margarita Manzo,"April 27, 2020",4, Love that I can get podcasts here that I don't get on Spotify. A bit weird though that there's no way to adjust the volume or skip tracks while my phone is locked or from the quick settings on Android
988,Dedra Lest,"April 28, 2020",2, I liked the old version way better. After the update... the home page is a mess. It's hard to see everything I subscribe to and which episode I'm in the middle of.
989,lex marasovich,"April 22, 2020",1, The app updated and dumped all my data. I followed like 20 podcasts and they are all gone. I have no idea how to remember them all and now I have to search instead of seeing exactly what's new when I open the app. I'm MAD
990,Ryan Mitchell,"April 26, 2020",5, This podcast app does everything I need it to. I love the auto download and auto delete features. This app was very basic when I first used it but has improved a lot over time.
991,Maureen Lucas,"April 29, 2020",5, Great tips and explanations and very enjoyable to listen to. I was half a pound off of my target weight and had some hard times and have lost my way but now I feel I can get back on track. Thank you
992,Brian,"April 30, 2020",5, Probably not using it to it's fullest but it has a dark theme (still waiting on Gmail & Play Music) and let's me listen to and download the handful of podcasts I listen to. UI is intuitive enough.
993,Mordechai Hellinger,"April 10, 2020",1," Was a great app, but with update the episodes don't paly one after another. Please return continuous play as it was before. It used to be a super clean simple app, now it's a complicated mess"
994,Sunny Singh,"April 3, 2020",3," Previous design had very clean UX which was exactly what I'd been looking for (please let me know if I can revert?), but you can't import custom RSS feeds. Had rated this 5 before the new design and before I learned of the RSS issue. :("
995,Duncan Aston,"April 4, 2020",1, This update was alright. The new way of displaying the podcasts your subscribed to is bad. Plus you changed every aspect of the app but still haven't set up a way for us to comment on podcasts/episodes.
996,Nathan Allen Meisenbach,"April 10, 2020",1," It barely works, fails too often, it drains data at an incredible rate. Please add a setting to limit streaming quality! Also, the app just randomly stops playing, even if episodes are downloaded."
997,Paul Vaughan,"March 14, 2020",2," It works well while playing podcasts, but the notification (in the dock) stays even when I close the app. Its quite frustrating. Edit: the app finally updated, but the issue persists. Have to force-stop the app to get rid of the notification."
998,Shanda E,"April 2, 2020",2," Update when I try to play a podcast on Mobile data the podcast will freeze saying it's ""buffering"" but won't start playing again until I skip 30 seconds ahead. Can you please fix this issue? I can't use Wifi when driving 🙁."
999,soth1 sol,"February 29, 2020",5," love listening to everything at 3.0x playback speed, with silenced trimmed (but not with comedy podcasts, since timing is everything). content/context, the more the merrier. that's why I prefer Google's podcast app ...it saves so much time, while providing all necessary info. Great!"
1000,Joshua Dawson,"March 3, 2020",5," My first podcast app, now that most of my rss feeds dried up. No reason to complain - easy to subscribe. Easy to find all my shows. No problems with the interface or the player. I like that it's no frills and easy to use."
1001,Anup Thomas,"March 10, 2020",4," Really cool material.. so much awesome podcasts on there. But only thing is sometimes it uses heavy data and for folks who has limited data, it might be an issue. But there is an option to download the podcast at home and use it on the commute"
1002,Júlio Barfcknecht,"March 11, 2020",4," Could have an option to download all the episodes at once. Could have a filter of language spoken in the episode. It's a really good app, as we are used to with google apps. Simple, efficient, clean and organized"
1003,huckleberry582,"March 11, 2020",3," I regularly have to go back and resubscribe to the podcasts I want. When I do subscribe again, it seems to have my play history there, but it is getting annoying. This has happened multiple times, so I guess it is time to move on."
1004,Brandon Farmer,"March 29, 2020",5," Originally gave this app 4 stars because it had a few extra taps that I felt we're unnecessary. Now with this new update, it's like they read my mind. The only thing it's missing now is storage options to SD card but I'm still giving 5 stars."
1005,Colin Cassar,"March 23, 2020",3," Give us the option to set a start time for individual podcasts. For instance, pod cast A starts 2 mins in every time. And this app would be perfect. That's the only thing keeping me from switching entirely. Also, where are the widgets?"
1006,Hüseyin Kavak,"March 25, 2020",3," It's good yet to be developed further. First, dark Mode. Second, personalized home screen. Then, a better layout, organisation. Then, personalized categories. But so far so good. Thank you very much."
1007,Vrej Hezaran,"March 29, 2020",2," Holy smokes, the new UI is overly busy and convoluted. The logic behind it is severely lacking. This isn't a case of ""I don't like new things!"" but rather a failure on every level of UI design and human interaction. C'mon guys, you can do better."
1008,Jonathan Doerzbacher,"March 29, 2020",1, Terrible new update destroys previous layout in favor of a faux facebook 'feed' of podcasts. I only have 3 subscriptions and it was already unwieldy putting those three shows together in a big lump on the home screen. Can only see 3-4 episodes without scrolling. Big step backward.
1009,Spencer Tomlinson,"March 28, 2020",2, Terrible Update. I have been using this app for almost a year now and have enjoyed it. A few days ago they came out with an update and now the interface is much harder and not as clean to use. Kept it at 2 stars instead of 1 because of how it used to be.
1010,Emma Montgomery,"March 30, 2020",1, Favorite podcast app and have been using for probably a year now. Hate the new redesign. Makes it much harder to see the podcasts you are subscribed to and to view them individually. Much less accessible and much more scrolling. Change it back!
1011,Paul Kawaguchi,"April 1, 2020",1," Since the update, podcasts stop to buffer, even if downloaded. I have to stop, skip forward, then start again, only to have it happen again on a couple minutes. Oh and the layout is difficult to navigate."
1012,Oleg Aravin,"April 5, 2020",2," The UI is the new version of the app became ugly. A lot of empty unused space, the podcasts icons now in a row instead of a table which is very inconvinied when you have a lot of podcasts. Can we please took back to the old version?"
1013,A Knight Who Says Ni,"April 2, 2020",2, Used to be great now the new interface is garbage and more confusing than it needs to be. Plus the podcasts buffer more often now. Boo! Boo! google go back to the previous interface. Uninstalling for now
1014,Thomas Nagel,"April 5, 2020",2," The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1, is because I can find podcasts on here that I can't find elsewhere. However, it crashes constantly. So............"
1015,Michael Jones,"April 10, 2020",1," Play queue? Why? And if the next podcast isn't the one I wanted to listen to next, it gets removed from the queue when I go find the one I did want, so then I have to go hunt for the first one so I don't lose it. This update was BAD"
1016,Adithya L R,"April 12, 2020",5," I love the design of the app - it's easy to use, the design is minimalistic yet beautiful. Only improvement suggested - I wish there were an option to autoplay episodes."
1017,Chris Edwards,"April 13, 2020",1," Can't pick download locations, new interface is seriously difficult to use, and the app just stops playing every 5 minutes even when the podcast is fully downloaded. Way to disappoint Google, your really blew it this time."
1018,Zach Arndt,"April 9, 2020",1," New layout is awful. Tried to like it, but it used to be simple and is now cluttered and have to scroll through to find your episodes. Will be finding a new podcast app."
1019,Felix,"April 18, 2020",3," Only thing keeping me from giving it a 5-star is the lack of a favorite feature, which makes it able to save podcast episodes to quickly find our way back to them again."
1020,Sahaj Singh,"April 24, 2020",5, Has come a long way since the beginning. Feature complete and easy to use. Layout is great without requiring config or management. Download options are baked in as well
1021,Nathaniel Phares,"April 22, 2020",1," Now have to create a playlist to listen to items in sequential order whereas before it was automatic, playlists constantly clear out so you have to rebuild the list, every update clears which podcasts you have listened."
1022,Joedy Payne,"April 21, 2020",5," I'm loving it! Easy to add and subscribe, love the fact that you can add the episodes to a playlist and have it auto play from one to the other."
1023,Cliona Hickey,"May 1, 2020",1, Would be 5 stars if it didn't keep crashing !!! It's the only app on my phone that does this..5 times in a the last podcast I listened to.I was holding out for an update to fix the bug...but nothing ?
1024,Glenn,"April 8, 2020",4," It's about time Google! Welcome to the 21st century! Update is great! Playlist option at last! Pity it took so long. Took years for a playlist, do we have to wait another 4 years for a widget?"
1025,Kacy Stocks,"March 3, 2020",3," Fully functional, good quality audio, and simple interface makes it easy to use. Edit: suddenly the app is crashing, not every time, but enough that it's annoying. 3 stars now, where it was 5."
1026,Skye-Leigh Bessinger,"March 30, 2020",3," Hi, I love this app for my podcasts however lately as I am listening to an episode the app closes itself after 2 minutes or so. It does this everytime I go back in to carry on listening to the episode. Please could you advise why it keeps doing this?"
1027,Paul Tietjens,"March 20, 2020",4," Edit: Very usable and stable and most of the features you would expect from a pod catcher. The discovery works well. Lacking most basic features, drains the battery like magic and loses its mind with any network interruption. This is a beta"
1028,Rich McNamee,"April 8, 2020",1," Since the update, my app freezes constantly and I have to skip ahead to keep playing. The user interface is clunkier and much less intuitive. Will go back to using other apps if not fixed soon."
1029,Anupam Gupta,"April 12, 2020",3, I desperately miss is the ability to import OPML from another app. There are tens of subscribed podcasts in another app (that can import or export OPML). I am avoiding adding all those subscriptions all over again in this app.
1030,Anmol Pandita,"March 27, 2020",3, Did not like the new design. I have more than 10 subscriptions. It is not very useful to keep scrolling horizontally. Please add a grid like design for subscriptions. Like the old version. Thanks for the dark theme!
1031,Jon Dinglasan,"March 18, 2020",4," Have found this to be a very desirable podcasting app. It provides an easy and reliable option for listening to podcast. Though the lack of customizability within the app regarding themes are limited, the functionality and overall usage is very likeable."
1032,Tim Francisco,"March 18, 2020",3," A basic podcast app. Easy to use and a clean interface. However, one major flaw is there is no way to add a purchased podcast. The one thing I would add is a way to group your favorite podcasts into categories. I haven't found any podcast app that does this."
1033,Michael G,"March 25, 2020",1," Latest update ruined usability of this app for those of us who, with less than perfect vision, like layouts that are large and customizable. This update shrunk ui elements and they are now no longer customizable. Sad but will have to seek another alternative that's easier to navigate."
1034,Hawka,"March 26, 2020",3," The most recent update made the UI harder to navigate, it'd be nice if there was a way to sort subscriptions by most-listened or something like that. But now, a lot of the time it doesn't notify me when a new episode has been posted."
1035,Ross Mc,"March 27, 2020",2," Update made it harder to browse! Before today I had a wall of subscription thumbnails to easily flick through, now it's changed to a linear list I have to scroll through and it's way less convenient and user friendly. Might go back to Castbox."
1036,Stefan Nikolaev,"March 29, 2020",1," The redesign killed this app for me. Went from a podcast centric layout, where you could easily see all your podcasts, to a list of episodes that is visually dominated by text. I don't care about personalization when all I follow is 10 to 20 podcasts."
1037,Kris A,"March 27, 2020",3, I like the old UI better maybe after some time I'll end up liking this update but as of right now it's...eh to me. I liked when it would automatically play the next episode on the podcast instead of me adding it to the queue. This may be operator error though
1038,chris rose,"March 31, 2020",2," Been happy using this app for ages, but am thinking of trying out others instead now. I know developers like to constantly change layouts, but the loss of automatic next episode playing is really annoying. I'm also getting buffering problems I never had before."
1039,Amanda Wells,"March 30, 2020",2, I loved this app before the update. I may find a different app to use because it is hard to find options with the new layout. Please go back to the old layout! It was easier to see what you follow and find new podcast.
1040,Seth Quillen,"March 31, 2020",1," Also, there's no way the person who redesigned this app still has their job! I've been using it for a week and it's just as bad. You never get used to the new layout because it's stupid. I'll probably uninstall and go back to podbean or stitcher."
1041,Tommy Jernigan,"March 31, 2020",3, Update broke the app. I can't stream for more than 5 min without having to skip forward so it will rebuffed. The audio just stopped otherwise. The new interface is also much more condensed and harder to read. I enjoyed the big tiles of podcasts.
1042,random guy,"April 1, 2020",5, This is a absolutely amazing app. It should be installed automatically on phones its just that good. From experience it (from my memory) doesn't have suggestions based on recent activities.
1043,Paul Taylor,"April 1, 2020",1," No change here. Google, in the world of podcasts it's all about content and you cut off my favs from the BBC, about a year ago. The new app looks like a feed and misses the point of catching your favourite podcasts from around the world daily.. Poor"
1044,Gabriel Luciano,"April 4, 2020",2, I used to really enjoy this app. They recently changed the UI so you can't easily see all you podcasts in a grid anymore. This makes it more annoying to find your podcasts.
1045,Patrick O'Connor,"April 7, 2020",1," Was good before this update ruined the UI. Pathetic attempt at revamp while podcast listeners have much more different podcasts to tune into and no way now to browse to the less listrned to ones. Don't download. Get stitcher, or apple products."
1046,Ben Onwudinjo,"April 3, 2020",4," It's pretty cool, I like all the features and it's ease of use, my only complaint is that it just randomly changes it's theme on its own even though I set it to dark permanently"
1047,Stephen McCarthy,"April 9, 2020",1, This app when from simple and easy to verbose and cluttered. The only new feature that I like is the ability to auto download episodes. I will be searching for a new podcast app.
1048,Greg Brown,"April 11, 2020",1," Now that the latest update on my phone broke Google Play Music, I installed this app. It cannot access any of the podcasts I've downloaded to my phone, making it useless to degree I would have thought impossible."
1049,Tim Brushaber,"April 13, 2020",2," The app works but the most recent update makes it a lot harder to navigate and use. If you have a lot of podcasts you follow, the most recent UI update makes managing these nearly impossible"
1050,Dawn Dorsey,"April 15, 2020",5," Everything I have searched for has been available. I have been able to do some customization regarding how I want the app to work, very easily. I'm very happy with this app!"
1051,Becky Mack,"April 13, 2020",5, I love this app. I would keep using it if there were a way to use it across devices. I had nothing but problems with Apple podcasts and google really holds up!
1052,Elly Cramer,"April 20, 2020",2, I want to be able to mark all episodes as completed when subscribing to a podcast I've listened to elsewhere or just want current episodes. This is a deal breaker for me.
1053,Jared Tweed,"April 15, 2020",5, It is the best podcast app available on the app store! Almost perfect! They are continuously adding new features and they have a wide range of podcasts.
1054,Murray Proctor,"March 27, 2020",2," Suddenly this app has become much less useful. The home screen no longer provides the choices of podcasts in progress, downloaded, etc. Instead of a cluster of podcast icons to chose from, you have to scroll just one row across the top of the screen."
1055,Mark Allshouse,"April 19, 2020",1, 2020 update: Bet you didn't think they could make this app worse. Wrong! UX is worse than ever. Opened the app a few days ago and all my podcast subscriptions were gone. It really doesn't get any worse than that.
1056,Stano Gazda,"March 7, 2020",3," Great app for podcasts. However it is strange google assistant does not understand - play my podcasts - command... Who cares about random podcasts, when you have your own list of podcasts you follow... Also no option to create a playlist?? Not convenient when driving..."
1057,Nicole Putala,"March 27, 2020",5," Google podcast has good variety of shows. Everything I've looked for so far, it has had. Also I like the way integrates with Google routines, I have it set up so when my alarm goes off it automatically starts specific podcast and motivates me to get up in the morning."
1058,suzanne ashby,"March 28, 2020",1," Deleting this app and finding a different podcast app. New update is awful, whereas before you had the grid at top and most recent releases below now it's just an endless scrolling down the page. Impossible to keep up with the most recent releases now."
1059,Amy Hale,"March 31, 2020",4," Great! Only problem is there are some podcasts I can't get on this platform. I'm not sure if that's because of Google or the podcast producer. Also, I preferred the previous layout because it allowed me to scroll through the podcasts more easily. But that's not a big deal."
1060,Keith Cruz,"March 29, 2020",1," Each time they do a big update they change the ui drastically, normally for the worst. Now it has more sections for the user's podcasts but expands it terribly. Unless you know the podcasts release dates you are going to struggle with the ones that post daily."
1061,ian tetreault,"April 2, 2020",4, The only podcast i listen to shows 293 episodes and only 291 episodes show up. Id give it a 5 star hands no doubt about it but its not up to date with the podcast. And would like to listen to the full podcast episodes.
1062,Clayton P Blackolivelover,"April 9, 2020",1, I used to love this app used it all the time but now my podcasts will play for 2 minuts and then just sit there saying buffering. For now I'm switching to Spotify I will try it again in a couple months.
1063,greg johnson,"April 10, 2020",3, Constant buffering. The more popular podcasts seem to have buffering issues on google podcast consistently. I listen to the same podcast on another app and have no issue. (Iheart or spotify) Otherwise it does the job.
1064,Adam Ring,"April 10, 2020",1," Stops podcasts and will not continue to play, despite episode being downloaded, or strong Wi-Fi or cellular signal. Has been an issue since the last update."
1065,Semy Lee,"April 13, 2020",5," I started listening to podcasts on my runs and Google Podcasts is simple, easy to use and has different options like playback speed. I've had no issues with it :) Thanks Google!"
1066,Christian Abelsson,"April 18, 2020",5, I've tried a fair amount of podcast apps and this is by far the best I've come across. I've only used it for a few days so far and haven't found anything to complain on. In simply love it!
1067,Christopher G,"April 30, 2020",1, The app is unreliable. Episodes I have listened to have been marked as not listend too. This has been an issue for awhile. I'd like a way to view download episodes by show.
1068,John Kubalak,"April 28, 2020",5," I would like to use the dark theme all the time, but whenever the app is restarted it reverts back to the light theme. This doesn't seem to happen every time. Probably after it's no longer in this system memory?"
1069,Jason Billings,"March 26, 2020",1," Update 3/26/20.Was....better than the podcast app on my iPhone. The most recent update/change completely ruined the feel and usefulness of this app. I've loved this app until now. Please change it back, otherwise I have to find something else. ....Pixel 3XL on Google Fi."
1070,James Rogers,"April 15, 2020",3, New layout makes it hard to see new podcasts. Requires a lot of scrolling. Downloaded podcasts stop playing intermittently and I have to fast forward and then rewind to get it to work
1071,Robert Morgan,"April 28, 2020",2, can't find easy way to rate my favorite podcasts apparently you can only read them on iTunes I don't know I'm a loyal Google customer but I'm not allowed to rate podcast that I like to give support. They still haven't fixed it so I take away a star. Fix
1072,Brandon Wallace,"April 16, 2020",5, With the power of Google behind podcast you know you're going to have choices. The interface is pretty simple. I love it as my go to podcast app.
1073,Jason P,"March 1, 2020",2," Would like to use this app but sadly it lacks a key feature: there is no way for me to add a podcast from an RSS feed. It's a shame, as this is quite an important feature for a modern podcast app and it not being available makes this unusable."
1074,Brendan Bossard,"March 4, 2020",5, Google Podcasts is very simple to use and provides a lot of interesting material for Android Auto to play by voice activation while I am commuting. I am already swamped with brain-stimulating material. I highly recommend it.
1075,Curt Bryant,"March 5, 2020",2, Been a user since day one. Not impressed with recent performance. Frequent crashes the last 3 days to the point that the app is unusable. Play resumes at random intervals. Not a good experience at all.
1076,Umar Khalid,"March 20, 2020",5," Good day Google. Firstly, appreciate and enjoying this free podcast app. This app is just missing options of Play next Make a queue Sleep timer for queue Auto delete after listening So far this is it. Thank you very much for making our lives easier better and entertaining."
1077,Vaibhav Karol,"March 17, 2020",5," The app is simple and quite easy to use and also features wide range of informative and entertaining podcasts, and I also loved its feature of showing the podcasts which are not finished , new episodes that got released , really an amazing app. One should really go for installing it."
1078,uttam manohar,"March 17, 2020",4, Nice podcast app it gets the work done. It also has a sleep timer in case you forget to close the app before you sleep.The interface is very clean and in order. However the only thing missing is the dark mode theme.
1079,Rebel Christensen,"March 19, 2020",4," I really enjoy using this app, but one thing I wish it would do differently is: if I decide that I want to start a podcast over, I do not want it to skip to the next unfinished episode, I want it to go to the next episode. Other than that, I love this app."
1080,Prissy Ferrell,"March 26, 2020",5," I like this app I use it to listening to Christian stories, focus on the family, bible study for ladies and Adventurers in Odyssey this are good to listen to with you kids when my kids were younger they would listen to the stories at bed time when my son was little he was having Nightmares and got s...Full ReviewI like this app I use it to listening to Christian stories, focus on the family, bible study for ladies and Adventurers in Odyssey this are good to listen to with you kids when my kids were younger they would listen to the stories at bed time when my son was little he was having Nightmares and got scared to go to sleep so someone told me about these little stories tell my little one how to handle things in life a good way Strengthen children relationships with Jesus Christ love love them"
1081,Kristen Beckman,"March 27, 2020",3," Does the job but only just. Feels very basic and needs to step up with additional features to prove itself compared to others like Castbox, such as being able to ""favorite"" podcast episodes and customize organization of podcasts on home screen."
1082,Ellen Holt,"March 28, 2020",2, this used to be my favorite podcast app but then the update happened! The customizable grid that they used to have was my favorite feature and now they're in a long scrolling line in update order that is not at all how I like to listen to podcasts at all.
1083,Kristin Broeder,"March 28, 2020",3, It was a good app until the most recent update. I can no longer find where I can connect to my Google Home. I hope I am missing it somehow. Please fix this or help me figure out where that function has gone.
1084,Michael McDonald,"April 5, 2020",1, The latest UI is horrible! Way too clunky. All the text and icons are too big now. Can please change the layout to what isn't was before and make it so it works in landscape mode please.
1085,Evyatar Kaufman,"March 28, 2020",2, It's fine but there's a lot to improve. First of all there should be a option in the settings to choose where offline downloaded episodes will be store (internal storage or sd card). Please add it ASAP it's so important!
1086,Sharon Wong,"March 28, 2020",2," Oh no, the most recent update makes the app less usable! The first thing I do is go to my downloads, which used to be on the main page, but this version makes me click on the activities? icon, then the downloads tab. Change it back, please?!"
1087,Kathleen McInnis,"March 29, 2020",3, Really love that dark mode is supported but hate the new layout. I miss the tiles! The small icons at the top are difficult to see. Even harder to tell which shows have new episodes. App is less easy to use.
1088,Kelly Jackson,"March 28, 2020",1," I would have given it a 5 star a week go. Please change back the format to what it was, it makes no sense better when my list was all on one page and does not automatically go on to next episode, am considering going through another streaming app very soon."
1089,Camden Mac Leod,"April 2, 2020",5," Google Podcasts is the greatest podcast listening device and it provides all the basic podcast app features and more (free downloading, channel searching, audio speed switches, trim silence features). I love these features and the app!"
1090,Jasmin Elizondo,"April 6, 2020",1," After the update, it no longer tells me what episodes I've listened to. Also if I pause an episode and then later go back into it it's not picking up from where I left off."
1091,April Johnston,"April 2, 2020",5," Seamless, easy to use, and best of all, I don't have to create any additional profiles/accounts because it's already hooked into my other Google accounts."
1092,Frank Lloyd,"April 10, 2020",4, Over all I like the app. But the new design makes it harder to view podcast channels. Would like the ability to move them so the most used appear on the first screen.
1093,Tabitha,"April 15, 2020",2, This app is so buggy. It stops randomly when opening other apps despite no sound being played. The app seems to open itself in multiple instances whenever you click in and out of it and it does not retain the theme setting. Is this app managed by high schoolers?
1094,Faye Casanova,"April 18, 2020",1, Doesn't update. A few of the shows I listen to are at least 2 yrs behind and only on this app. Won't stay in dark mode either. Keeps reverting back to blinding light mode.
1095,Hugo Smith,"April 25, 2020",1, Very unreliable. The que isn't followed automatically and the que gets lost. The app seems to get worse all the time. App freezes easily and streaming quality is erratic.
1096,Jessica Fleming-Richards,"April 28, 2020",5, This app is great. I. Love listening to the podcast case files. The cases are presented really well and the presenter is great at drawing you in so you cant stop listening.

1098,A Google user,"March 25, 2020",2, With the new UI is there a way to form subject lists?! The last version it was easy to sort podcasts into themes. The new look seems to be just a long list. Can you at least let me know how to customize the organization of the podcasts.... Thank you

Bye Google Podcast."
1100,Chinmay Marketkar,"March 26, 2020",2," Hi, changing my rating from 5 star to 2 due to the new user interface. Could you kindly revert back to the old user interface or make changes to the new one, the new one is confusing and as good at exploring new stuff as compared to the old interface."
1101,Taha Adnan,"April 19, 2020",5, Very great app. Highly recommended. I would appreciate if the devs at google can add few options. 1 Bookmark or save the audio podcasts. 2 Make an own playlist combining various podcasts.
1102,Rahul Choudhury,"April 14, 2020",5," The app is good and all but lacks certain basic features like playlists, auto downloading, etc. Edit : The latest update has brought every feature i was looking for in a full fledged podcast app."

Edit: I just came back to reiterate how pissed I am you ruined one of my favorite apps. I literally have stopped using it entirely now. Thanks guys.. for removing the SINGLE best feature of it.. the ability to organize your favorites in the order you like.
1104,Henry Hsue,"March 13, 2020",3, The titles are cut off when you scroll through the episodes of a podcast. You have to open up the episodes one by one to discover the subject. Pretty important UI detail I hope can be handled. Maybe just allow landscape view.
1105,Kenneth Spera,"March 26, 2020",5," Great app! Updated the app on 3/26/2020, and found that they implemented automatic downloads. Even better, they added a neat feature to be able to granularly select WHICH podcasts auto-download from the same settings screen where you enable the automatic download feature. Nice touch, Google."
1106,Mark Lunney,"March 25, 2020",4," Thanks for saving my eyes with the dark mode in the latest update. Would still like to see control from the notification shade, so when you need to pause a podcast you don't have to search through your active apps to find it again."
1107,Mátyás Budavári,"March 14, 2020",5," Previously I listened to my favourite podcasts through their own websites, this app help me keep them in one place, and lets me keep track of where I left off, shows the new episodes, other than these it recommends me other great channels."
1108,Hannah M,"March 11, 2020",5," Love this app in comparison to both other Podcast Apps on Android and the all powerful Spotify.

1110,Robert Battle,"March 16, 2020",1, Could be great but falls short. You can't regularly download podcasts so it always wants to buffer. They don't comply with BBC distribution guidelines so content I want to listen to is unavailable. I'm switching back to a different app
1111,sebastien garcin,"March 21, 2020",2," Missing so many features, as reviewing podcasts, saving them as playlists, not updating properly and just discovered that you can't upload your library to shift to another app to make it harder to leave, we'll I'm leaving right now, enough monopoly Google."
1112,Andrew Kielback,"March 25, 2020",2, After the new update you're going to have a bad time if you subscribe to more than a few podcasts. The amount of information on each screen is greatly reduced so you have to scroll around a ton to see everything.
1113,Chris S,"March 26, 2020",2, The new layout of this app makes organizing your library difficult to do. Everything is scattered and even episodes you've already listened to remain visible. The latest update was a huge step backwards.
1114,Stian Fjeller,"March 29, 2020",2, Once there was a simple and smooth podcast player. Obviously there was a demand for a less simple and smooth podcast player. So they made a new UI. Now I have to unsubscribe some podcasts to keep a kind of overview.
1115,Adam Dollar,"March 28, 2020",1, The new layout is terrible and a total misunderstanding of how people listen to their various podcasts. Definitely switching back to pocketcast until this is fixed. Many people are vocalizing this exact complaint so I hope it is fixed quickly.
1116,Reza Ghaeli,"March 28, 2020",1," Was good until the new version with a unfriendly layout.... I am in search of another player. With other experiences I have encountered from google, it looks like they have lost their rationale and leadership in software industry."

1121,Carlos Melendez,"March 31, 2020",3, I don't like the new layout. No idea why they changed it. I follow way too many pods and it was easier to have a full screen primarily dedicated to the one's I'm subscribed too. Now scrollijg through them on top is annoying.
1122,Kim Cate,"April 1, 2020",1, Loved this app until recent update. Now it will not skip to next episode. I've checked the settings everything is correct. I also do not like how it lists the podcasts you've subscribed too. Please fix this!
1123,Ssekandi Magala Abdul,"April 2, 2020",5, The perfect 'head-on' competitor to Apple Podcasts. The design UI is simple and sleek. You cannot publicly say that you listen to podcasts if you aren't using Google Podcasts.
1124,Shoals Yakkin' with Hatch,"April 1, 2020",2," Broken and buggy after update, after downloading podcasts on wifi, I leave to go for a run in an area with no signal the podcasts stop playing to buffer and never recover, why does it need to buffer if the podcasts are downloaded locally.

1125,Tyler Crowell,"April 1, 2020",1, With the new ui update no podcast will play for more than 2 minutes in the background with the screen off. When I turn the screen back on the podcast will just buffer endlessly. This is on WiFi and LTE.
1126,Sean Long,"April 13, 2020",1," Initially was higher. Now I changed it because of the new update made this app from something simple and no frills, to something that isn't that anymore. Whatever happened to if it's not broken dont fix it????"
1127,Tom G,"April 10, 2020",5, Google podcasts keeps getting better and better to use. It's my favorite app for podcasts. Still haven't gotten used to the UI but it's way better than other competing apps.

1133,Ethan,"April 26, 2020",1, App has become glitchy since last update and has a less intuitive layout then it used to. Can't even keep track of which episodes I have listened to as it constantly marks played episodes as unplayed.
1134,Matty Sereno,"April 11, 2020",1, Horrible UI after most recent update. If you are subscribed to more than 6 or 7 podcasts there is an unbearable amount of scrolling. Devs need to fix this fast or I'm going to change my podcast app.

1136,Andrew Soule,"April 11, 2020",1," The most recent app redesign is terrible. This app was perfect, but they made it trash in one fell swoop. Very disappointing. I'd pay to have it back the way it was just a week or two ago."
1137,Paul Clancy,"March 28, 2020",1, So far so good. Easy interface. Good content. Edit: March.28/20. BOO! They just completely changed the interface which was my favorite part. Now I have to switch to a different podcast provider.
1138,Deepak Rana,"April 4, 2020",1," Used to be great, the new update is a big step backwards in terms of the GUI. Playing a downloaded episode goes into 'Buffering' after a few mins."
1139,Marla Rountree,"March 18, 2020",5, Amazing app that puts all your podcast together in one place. Great search feature helps you find new podcasts on any subject. To the team who manages this app: good job and thank you for making my life more enjoyable.
1140,Holly Decker,"March 26, 2020",2, I hate the latest update - the podcasts don't play automatically through the episodes like before. The fact you have to create a queue for them to auto play is ridiculous. Also the layout is horrible. Please change it back!
1141,Nick Weaver,"April 1, 2020",1, The app was great until you decided to change it the other day. I am getting rid of it and finding a new podcast app. You took it from nice and easy and clean to use to a mixed up jumbled mess. No thank you. Im out.
1142,Drew Shockley,"April 3, 2020",1, This new update is absolutely terrible. The reason I use this podcast app was because of the openness of the app. Moving all the following podcasts to the top in a single row was one of the absolute worst things you couldv'e done.
1143,James Hawkins,"April 7, 2020",1, New UI makes it harder to view favorites.. They're all bunched together in a scroll bar at the top which makes it easier to accidentally refresh the page and cause you to scroll all over again 😑..
1144,Tom Crate,"April 4, 2020",1, This app was brilliant because of its clarity and simplicity. The new layout is anything but clear or simple. Time to look for a new podcast app sadly.
1145,Ramin Kargar,"April 20, 2020",4," Please provide an option to add episodes to Favorites. Even better, an option to create different folders to add favorite or any other kind of episodes to them. Something like what is done in Google News app."
1146,Keenan,"April 20, 2020",4," It's nice to listen to podcasts with this to and from school. All I need to do is download them before leaving. I'm almost caught up on Critical Role, and I've not been more joyful 😊"
1147,James Gray,"April 22, 2020",1, I had a bunch of podcasts in my favorites and they have all disappeared and there is no getting them back so I have to search every time I want to listen to a certain podcast.
1148,Bibek Yadu,"April 25, 2020",2," Earlier it was flawless. But now no podcast is being played, leaving only Buffering. Without downloading the story it's impossible to listen. Need improvement."
1149,Dana Levin,"March 29, 2020",1, Hate the new update and the way it's set up. It doesn't play the next episode automatically. I can't put my subscriptions in order the way I like them. I'm so frustrated. I used to love this app. I'm headed to spotify I guess.
1150,A Google user,"March 30, 2020",2," The new UI is harder to use, although I like the queue feature. But since the update it seems like I've had a harder time downloading things, it takes longer and it fails more often."
1151,Eric Sharrock,"April 8, 2020",1," I can't stand this new layout its the one reason I don't like Spotify I think Google's layout was much more user friendly, If you must keep this please give us an option to change our layout to what we like. New layout, D-"
1152,Patrick Pfeifer,"March 31, 2020",2," Not liking the new update. The library is a single row horizontal scroll, terrible UI! The stream to device button is hidden on the useless activity tab. The whole app is clunkier, less simple and looks older. Wish I could revert to the last version."
1153,Joseph,"March 27, 2020",1, I most definitely loved this app prior to the update but as of now the rating will be 1 star; like the main stay home page is a jumble mess with a long list of half listened to podcasts with absolutely no sorting for new vs old. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL CHANGE.
1154,AJ Llana,"March 16, 2020",3," Dunno what happened, but when listening to podcasts, the audio is slow. This happened after the last update. And I don't see an option to speed up or slow down the audio. I hope this can be fixed on the next update."
1155,Nicole Rave,"March 6, 2020",5," I love podcasts, and this app is perfect for them. If you use Google assistant, you can choose to play your favourite podcast where you left off right after your morning briefing. Just perfect."
1156,Saket Anand,"March 8, 2020",2, Brilliant and simple app. I listen to podcasts before i go to bed and the absence of dark mode is a deal breaker for me. Please implement it as soon as possible. Other than that it's a great application.
1157,Hilary Agro,"March 21, 2020",3, The lack of a dark mode is incredibly frustrating as I listen to podcasts to sleep but have a bright light in my face from the white background any time I go into the app. My phone is set to dark mode but it's not applying to the Podcasts app.
1158,JandKbly Blystone,"March 27, 2020",4, Works really well and like using this app. It works great in our vehicle. Needs to have a feature to rate the podcast episodes. This would be a great additional feature and would help our podcast creating friends if we could review and like their episodes with their sponsors.
1159,Matt Praught,"March 27, 2020",5," Latest updates: Queues, notifications and auto downloads. Thank you for finally adding these features. Thankful I can now add a few pods to my list when I go for a run and don't have to stop and search for something else to listen to!"
1160,Gina Knowles,"April 1, 2020",1, The update has logged me out of my account and it won't let me sign back in. I can't subscribe to any of the podcasts I subscribed to in the past. The new interface is terrible. This new update is not user friendly. I'm mostly disappointed that I can't get into my account.
1161,Andrew LeTourneau,"April 1, 2020",1, Buffers all the time. Cannot get the app to load a single podcast.I have several podcast downloaded and even those podcasts will buffer every 30 to 45 seconds and I cannot listen to the full podcast.
1162,dog13garcia,"April 2, 2020",5," Love the app, so great to be able to just listen to all my favorites and it give me notifications on when new ones are out that I really want to listen to!!!"
1163,Hares Mahmood,"April 7, 2020",4, My only complaints are that the beta is bit unpolished (which is obviously to be expected) and that there's no option to back up or export podcast subscriptions.
1164,Spence Walton,"April 12, 2020",5," Great app. All my favourite podcasts in one place, all for free. I own a Samsung device and there are no bugs or glitches to report."
1165,Adrian Gutoiu,"April 9, 2020",2, App doesn't stop unless I Force Stop it and that make my Google Feeds page disappear also. Is a great experience on Android Auto but really annoying that I need to restart the phone after each use to get my feeds back.
1166,Braxton McNeill,"April 8, 2020",4, This app has a good looking user interface & large collections of the shows I listen to. I generally listen to news shows & tech podcasts. This app has plenty of options and search is easy.
1167,Lyricson,"April 13, 2020",2," This app is great for the podcast I love the simple interface and it's a very light app. But recently after the new update this app keeps on getting crash and force close, please fix that."
1168,Tom Gilbertson,"April 16, 2020",1, I used to like this app. I don't care for the new design and my podcasts keep stopping after a few minutes. Time to remove this app and find something else.
1169,Robert Nail,"April 19, 2020",4," Never expected to use this. But I took a chance and ALL the podcast I listen to are here. Easy to use, very simple menus."
1170,Tim Thompson,"April 17, 2020",1, Not usable. No option to 'Mark all Played' for a podcast or a mark played button for each podcast. Also missing some mainstream podcasts. I doubt the developers of this app actually use it.
1171,Kumar Ashok,"April 22, 2020",4," Good app. Very useful. But needs some more improvement. While closing a cast, it still remains over the screen."
1172,William Leitzman,"April 27, 2020",1," It's a great app, but there is one major glitch. Podcasts that I have already listened to keep showing up as not listened to."
1173,Raul Ruiz,"April 30, 2020",5, Excellent app I lost my podcast on spotify and was struggling to find it but it's in here and I don't have the same issues with this app like others like skipping or pausing with my headphones.
1174,callahan jason,"March 30, 2020",4," Finally! Now this is a nice app. As of 3/30/20 this app now downloads what I choose (still wish there was an option of where to download), and gives notifications of new episodes, the queue feature is nice..nice job this version. Don't screw it up"
1175,michael brown,"March 25, 2020",4, A big face lift has happened and so far I like it a lot. I miss being able to organize my podcasts. I was able to group my different podcast by my own categories or by podcast network. Would love some of that back. Only thing keeping me from 5 stars.
1176,G Pother Illowhite,"March 27, 2020",4," The notification for Podcasts now works! Google app update (Mar 26) seems to have fixed the Audio player. & yay, a Dark theme for Podcasts :) But entering the app via notification forces Light theme, & both versions of the app are duplicated in Recents. Plz fix."
1177,William Swiderski,"March 26, 2020",1," User interface ruined with the latest update and now shows the list as huge entries for each podcast making is extremely hard to scroll through and see them all. Typical google, never pass up a chance to ruin a perfectly functional interface!"
1178,Sai Kamesh,"March 27, 2020",5, The podcast collection is vast. The UI just got so much better. And we can add podcasts to queue. And interface also looks clean and neat. It has all the essential features now. It also shows some links related to podcast at the bottom which is very useful.
1179,Higinio Calderón Jr,"March 27, 2020",5," 27-March-2020: I haven't been listening to any podcasts, due to new* constraints at work. So tonight I opened the app for the first time in weeks, and damn was I pleased with the changes made to this thing! A queue, auto downloading, and new episode notifications!!!! Yes, Please, and Than You!!"
1180,Alexander Cusworth,"March 7, 2020",5," Clean, simple, and I can find every show I'm looking for. Even found a few great shows that we're suggested to me. Integrates into Android Auto really nicely, make it easy to listen to my shows on the road."
1181,Rick Meyer,"March 30, 2020",5," Really like most of the app except one huge annoyance, can't dismiss the notification when not playing. A volume boost feature and equalizer would be nice additions too. Update: Notification can now be dismissed. Thank you!"
1182,Abdul Meykal,"March 26, 2020",5," Great app. Very smooth. What they need however is a dark mode, in contrast to the light mode that's good for bright screens. Also, would love a way to organize downloaded podcast episodes by category or folder"
1183,Jonathon Daku,"March 27, 2020",1, The update claims the app can now auto download episodes but I dont have those features after I downloaded the latest version and rebooted my phone they are still not there. I preferred using play music to listen to podcasts but some are not available on there now!
1184,Steve Rhodes,"March 28, 2020",2," Horrendous update, home page now very unclear and confused. Any chance of a roll back to previous version, I knew where everything was there. It wasn't broken and didn't need fixing."
1185,Wayne Tams,"March 28, 2020",2," Buggy with Android auto plays for 5 minutes and stops have to skip forward 30s to resume. Also not a fan of the new auto integrated, really hard to find in progress podcasts when you're listening to more than one at a time."
1186,Nicholas Engel,"April 1, 2020",2, Current design is terrible. Scrolling through a single line of podcasts you've subscribed to is maddening. I'm using something else until they go back to having full pages of podcasts that can be organized and swiped through.
1187,Meghan Snell,"April 5, 2020",5, Best platform for listening to podcasts on my android phone so far. I've tried Castbox and Podcatcher and both were very glitchy and crashed a lot. This app has been consistent and reliable.
1188,Nicholas Grevas,"April 7, 2020",1, Would regularly break down and just stop right in the middle of my podcast. Happened often enough that I'm switching after putting up with it for far too long.
1189,HARSHIT JAIN,"April 6, 2020",5, I love this app. Its become too addictive now. I listen to a podcast first thing in the morning. Thats usually the time I'm getting ready and i have good 40-50 minutes of nothing else to do..
1190,Enrico Signoretti,"April 7, 2020",1, Idiotic product. Can't imoort RSS feeds directly. Impossible to find content on anchor.fm and other services. It doesn't even find content already registered in Google Play Music Podcast. Is it me or is it the usual Google?
1191,Shariyf Grevious,"April 11, 2020",1, They changed the format to make it completely encumbered! Update: They are sending everyone a generic response on how the ui changes is related to ios version and uniformity. This is a HORRIFIC response and reason!
1192,Grant Oliver,"April 5, 2020",1," Why did you change the app? It used to be fine, and you completely changed everything, for the worse. The new layout is awful, it's so difficult to quickly scroll through subscriptions and find what I want to listen to."
1193,Tananchai Tongbai,"April 15, 2020",3, I come to give rate better because it seem the sound stops problem was fixed. Another problem I found is that the dark mode does not work when open app from lock screen.
1194,Kevin Rowlett,"April 12, 2020",5," I have had no negative experiences with this app. Quite the contrary; I have found several good podcasts, and the app is reliable and functions very well."
1195,Ahmed Samir,"April 12, 2020",4, I like this app so much. It enrich my time with a lot of information and knowledge. However I need to create my own podcast but it seems that it's not supported in my region Can any one help me?
1196,Zac Freeman,"April 11, 2020",1," New layout is awful!! Old layout wasn't perfect but was logical and customisable, now podcasts and episodes get lost easily, and nothing is where I left it!! Find another app."
1197,Mike Merrill,"April 17, 2020",1," New design is great, in theory. Podcasts saved and played yesterday still show as new, and not that it was already added to the queue and played."
1198,Peter Chan,"April 19, 2020",5," Switching from pocket cast. I doesn't believe it would be good at the beginning, but I found it works fast and work very well with other Google b products I even using it on iOS devices now... Only hope it would also works within Sonos app"
1199,Pascal LEspérance,"April 16, 2020",1, After update it only plays for a few minutes then it stops. The new interface makes it hard to read description and makes it cluthered.
1200,Tom Sutherland,"April 22, 2020",5," Wide range of podcasts, can be downloaded or listen on line. Easy to control notifications, subscribe to channels and so on."
1201,Quincy Gips,"April 21, 2020",5," Love this app! Donut Media's Past Gas is amazing. Great content and a great YouTube channel. If you like cars and the backstory to them while having fun, thats the podcast for you"
1202,Baz Birch,"April 23, 2020",4, Overall it works with no major issues. The interface could be more user friendly but I am able to find the podcast I listen to.
1203,I AM ROMAN,"April 21, 2020",3," The new layout is discombobulation, get rid of it before you lose all your guests. The death knell is everyday one or two of my podcasts just won't play or download."
1204,Chase Ford,"April 26, 2020",3," Had a great design before the redesign, now it sucks. Navigation, home screen, and customization are all worse after the recent redesign. Wish I could get the old layout back."
1205,Sierra Smith,"April 24, 2020",1," Can't even sign in anymore with the new update because the email is already on my device, which of course it's my phone and my email. So can't even access my subscribed podcasts anymore. App was ruined"
1206,Chuck Powell,"April 28, 2020",5," Simple podcast app with most of the major podcasts I listen too. If I'm doing something, its nice to listen to a podcast instead of draining my battery with it on YouTube."
1207,Michael Hall,"April 28, 2020",3," Broken in Android Auto, when you go into subscriptions it shows nothing so can't find where you are up to in each one unless you pick up the phone and search that way.... Dangerous AND MUST BE FIXED asap"
1208,A Google user,"April 3, 2020",2, The app started crashing again since the last update. The episode at play has to be restarted from the last buffered position instead of where the app crashed. Kindly fix it.
1209,Nicole Stevenson,"April 2, 2020",1, The new interface hides all my favorite podcasts. It's messy and the new episodes are hard to navigate. The app was fine and now everything is hidden!
1210,Alvaro Garcia,"March 27, 2020",2, I'm getting a really weird bug where I close the app and when the phone connects to my car Bluetooth it automatically keeps playing anyways. Also how do I go back to the old format? Hard to scroll through all the podcasts I'm subscribed to with this new format
1211,James Hammer,"March 26, 2020",4," Am very happy with this app, I have both iOS and Android and can now sync between both systems. The only complaint is that is keeps bringing up old podcasts that I have listened to, it would be nice to have a bulk mark read feature."
1212,Martin Jungkvist,"April 6, 2020",1," Randomly it crashes and it forgets where I was the the podcast episode I was listening to. Have sent logs to Google. Update: still same issue, but now the design is worse too."
1213,Jay Clark,"April 16, 2020",4," Updating my review to reflect the recent update to add a play queue. This has made it much better. Almost a perfect podcast player, especially being a free app."
1214,vettel loab,"March 3, 2020",5," This app is the best to listen to podcasts. i have been using lots of other apps but since i downloaded this app it changed everything, a simple UI plus the google search feature and great listening experience. Big thank you to google for making this app"
1215,Ryan S,"March 8, 2020",4, Reviews & Save for later - Can't do it :( Podcasters are always asking for reviews and I'd love to give them proper kudos. I'd also like to be able to scroll through on Sundays and find episodes I can listen to throughout the week.
1216,Eugeniya Kharatyan,"March 5, 2020",1," It used to work perfectly but recently the app has reset all my subscriptions. In addition, now it restarts every two minutes whenever something is playing. It is practically impossible to use."
1217,chris martin,"March 9, 2020",4," Good app for podcasts, only issue is when casting its one of the very few apps you can not control volume by phone. It just controls main phone volume not chromecast volume. If thats added it will be pretty much perfect."
1218,Patrick Amador,"March 11, 2020",5," Has everything I want in a podcast app. Great for listening to serialized shows, adjusting playback speed, and you can download episodes for offline playback. Easy to use and tons of free content."
1219,Matt Nelson,"March 25, 2020",1," Latest update ruined the best part of this app, being able to organize your subscriptions in any order you want. Now you are stuck with two options, alphabetical or most recently added."
1220,Eleanor Bash,"March 28, 2020",2, I really like this app until the new update. What happened to the list of in progress episodes? It's hard to find the podcast I want without scrolling for ages. And CBC News podcasts no longer play at all!
1221,Dylan Johnston-Jordan,"March 27, 2020",2," The new layout is a serious downgrade. It makes navigating my shows a chore. Restore the option to display them in tiles, not everything has to be a feed like Instagram. You should know better."
1222,Cameron,"March 28, 2020",4," Love this app. Wish there was a ""mark all as played"" option, since older podcast episodes I've skipped just sit in my ""new episodes"" tab and I have to go through all of them one by one and mark them as played."
1223,Caia Johnson,"March 28, 2020",1," This app was easy and intuitive to use until the recent update. I absolutely hate it, I cannot find unfinished episodes or how to enable autoplay. It's just awful. Please change it back."
1224,Jeff S.,"March 28, 2020",3, Hate the new format. The setup in Play is better. It inevitably stops playing about halfway through and I have to open my phone to get it playing again and it never starts in the same spot it stopped.
1225,prayush khadka,"March 28, 2020",2, The latest updated version presents a cluttered look. The previous was sleeker and easier to use. I feel like it has become really messy. It would be better if we get the option to use the previous UI.
1226,Global Voyager,"March 31, 2020",2, The old layout was cumbersome and not well thought out. But the new layout makes you miss the old layout. I have 50 podcasts. How do find the particular 3 I really care about without infinite scrolling.
1227,Matthew Freeman,"April 2, 2020",1," Old version was great, but the new layout is nothing short of atrocious, an absolute mess. Time for a new podcast player."
1228,Chris Jones,"April 6, 2020",2," I like it. Simple. Easy. And I really like the new layout. But since the update, I'm experiencing that bug that buffers downloaded episodes. No okay ☹️"
1229,Chris Head,"April 5, 2020",1, Doesn't work anymore after the last update a lot of the podcast don't work and they actually crashed the app and the ones that do have broken up parts and you can't skip past them the app is just not working anymore
1230,Samuel Eric,"April 5, 2020",3," The app should be in dark theme, but when I open the app by clicking the audio player, it is in white theme. I have set it to be in dark theme, but the problem is still there."
1231,davebarry3,"April 6, 2020",1," The new version is unusable. It makes it so head to find what I'm looking for. I struggle to see the redeeming qualities of this upgrade. Please, please, please make improvements or I'm out."
1232,Pako Dire,"April 7, 2020",1," After the update, I could not download my podcasts offline I coul only download one podcast. The new format is the worst You have to scroll down before finding the one you want to listen to"
1233,Jenil Gohel,"April 11, 2020",4," Love everything about this app. Very easy to use, works flawlessly, many options available for podcasts. Suggestion : Can add bookmark option to save good podcasts."
1234,Dustin Easterday,"April 13, 2020",4," Great app, the only thing I wish would be better is if you could listen to your daily podcast in a playlist style, instead of going through one by one"
1235,Basilius Prabawa Brodjonegoro,"April 9, 2020",3," So you just finished listening to a podcast episode, right. You like it. You want to listen to another episode. Can you just move to the next/prev episode? Noooo you have to find the podcast and scroooolll and find the episode you just finished and click the one above/below it."
1236,Govindan Kartha,"April 10, 2020",5," Smooth delivery, quick download, jumps back about 10 second upon resume, which is about perfect. I'm really pleased with the ease of use and quickly."
1237,Anthony Larson,"April 9, 2020",1, Can't listen to a Podcast for more than five minutes before it freezes and continues buffering. Used to work great but now it's a pain.
1238,Evaristo Rojas,"April 11, 2020",1," On the home screen, the completed episodes are shown as unplayed. This is a new bug introduced on the most recently released version."
1239,shake,"April 15, 2020",5," This redesign make the app the best in my opinion for listening to podcasts, I hope they continue to investing in improving the app. At the moment I'm very grateful for it!!"
1240,Robert Gray,"April 16, 2020",4," Works well enough, searching for a particular genre of podcasts can be a bit of a pain, but otherwise good app."
1241,Agnis Ritaputri,"April 21, 2020",4," So, i downloaded the app, and it's good and all, but i suggest adding a comment or a review section, cuz i really want to support the artists on my favorite podcasts.... Please add those two or at least one of them"
1242,Ambrose Ledesma,"April 27, 2020",5, Love it but can you add an automatic delete like the old app? Delete after x amount of dayd maybe. I can auto download but they just stack until I manually delete them! Other than that I love the app!
1243,Sandro Macena,"April 27, 2020",3," THey are doing a good progress on app but they need to create a functionality to listen in the Alexa Amazon Echo dot. FOr now I'll put 3 star, after this I'll change to 4 stars or more."
1244,Emma Morley,"April 24, 2020",4, Very simple and easy to use. I use this for all my podcast listening. I hope Google develops this to include cool new features like Spotify.
1245,ThunderShock,"April 24, 2020",5," Love the app, love dark mode, hope that the text is a little but bigger and the interface is more like gmail where everything is much more easily accessible."
1246,Ank Deshmukh,"May 1, 2020",3," The application is amazing. I wish we could search a podcast within a channel. If this feature is introduced, it's a five star!"
1247,Arshi Anjum,"April 29, 2020",1, The update is not useful...as all the podcasts are sort to clubbed together...it would be better if all my subscribed podcasts would be segregated into different categories to which they belong...taht would make things much easier.
1248,Tom Bowker,"March 3, 2020",4," Edit: Now sorted Love it and think it's going to be huge for podcasting, but badly needs an update with lockscreen controls and auto turn off after a given time or end of podcast - like every other player I've ever used..."
1249,A Google user,"March 22, 2020",4," Clean design and a lot of old bugs have been fixed, but it still lacks features of other podcast apps. Looking forward to the rumored big updates that should start rolling out any day. Galaxy S10e, Android 10, One UI."
1250,Andrew Brown,"April 13, 2020",2, Streamlined and simple. The interface showing downloaded and in progress podcasts could be more prominent. Edit: new UI takes away most of the appealing features.
1251,Lane Hrubesky,"March 25, 2020",1, Loved app and had no issues until recent update (3/25/20). New interface is major step down for me. Would like custom grid back as new scrolling top row appears to list podcasts based off of new episodes until you click into them.
1252,Jeffrey Everroad,"March 31, 2020",1, How the hell does a episode that's been downloaded buffer? Almost exactly every two minutes and stays buffering for eternity? What the hell is Google doing? But yet the Google a play Music version works just fine. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?!?!
1253,Gaute Zakariassen,"April 11, 2020",2, I don't get why this app won't cast directly to my Sonos like Play Music does. The latest update made the app even worse - now the Chromecast function is only accessible from the main page.
1254,Sean Logue,"March 7, 2020",5, I love using the Google Podcasts App to listen to some of my favourite podcasts on a regular basis. The app works fluidly and the new dark mode works really well. I would highly reccomend using the app if your already into that Google ecosystem or your just looking for a great podcast app.
1255,Marcus Lee,"March 5, 2020",5, At this moment in time I love Google podcasts. It's a free service that I can enjoy while doing other activities. I can't say there is something that I have found that I don't like because I have not been using it very long. But as of now I love it.
1256,Luis Soto,"March 12, 2020",3," I hope its a work in progress right now, it doesn't have an option for stopping autoplay you can only do it per episode. Also the biggest issue is the lack of a dark them!!"
1257,James Wheeler,"March 22, 2020",1," Used to love this, now the notifications won't close... Ever... I even force stopped the app and the stupid notification is still in the window. Deleting this and finding a better, less intrusive podcast player seems the only option."
1258,ryan burgess,"March 25, 2020",2," The new to update is horrible. I do not want to scroll so much to find a podcast. I had my podcast layed out in an order I liked and could find easily. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
1259,Pete Lomont,"March 25, 2020",3," Don't go the wrong way! I already miss the ""newest"" feature and it's only been 4 hours. I liked being able to see what the newest podcasts were from those that I subscribe to."
1260,Matthew Gross,"March 29, 2020",2, I do not like the new interface. I liked the larger look and now I have to scroll across the small top bar to see my subscriptions. Poor design for those of us with less than perfect eyesight.
1261,Ben Dover,"March 29, 2020",2," Finally got dark mode. But the UI sucks now. The podcast icons are really small, and there is no way to see them because they are so small. The list of episodes take up the entire screen. FAIL."
1262,G S,"March 27, 2020",1," I hate the update. It's almost unusable for me. Finicky, fiddly and counterintuitive. It's stress inducing, unclear and visually awkward. If you're a listener of alot of podcasts, it's just too messy."
1263,Alison Alves,"March 29, 2020",2, The new layout is horrible. Now I have a puzzle on my screen. I simply can't find where I want to listen to without having to do a search e even when I do that not all episodes appears.
1264,Tom K.,"March 28, 2020",2," What happened to the ability to order the podcasts? Must have. New UI is much more cluttered and hard to navigate. Appreciate the new functions and features, but why cdnt you intergrate them without materially changing the layout. Disappointed."
1265,Shaunette Babb,"March 30, 2020",2, It no longer automatically plays the next episode in the series and there is no way to get this back without creating a playlist. I just want to play the next one in the sequence automatically... like it used to.
1266,Nate Roiger,"April 5, 2020",2, Latest update just pauses in the middle of playback when playing over Bluetooth. Doesn't matter if I download or stream. Entirely unusable at the moment.
1267,S. Lopez,"April 2, 2020",5," I have been listening to this podcast for a few weeks now. A few friends recommend it. They mentioned that it is a very UNbiased show & have very interesting, relevant, current & informative topics & guest speakers. They are correct! I am a new listener for life. Keep up the great work, ladies & gen...Full ReviewI have been listening to this podcast for a few weeks now. A few friends recommend it. They mentioned that it is a very UNbiased show & have very interesting, relevant, current & informative topics & guest speakers. They are correct! I am a new listener for life. Keep up the great work, ladies & gentleman!"
1268,Derek Moore,"April 1, 2020",1," New layout is horrendous. And don't respond with a link to explain the ""rationales behind the new UI."" Give an option to switch back or don't say anything at all. Looks like I'm on the hunt for a new podcast app, yet again."
1269,Aashutosh Aditya,"April 7, 2020",1, New update change is an extremely bad design catering to only one type of podcast listener and it's tiring to navigate within the app. Bring back the old version or design a better UX!
1270,Jarrod Schindler,"April 9, 2020",1, After the recent update my podcasts are only playing for 2-3 minutes and then stopping. This is particularly frustrating while using Android Auto as it is quite distracting.
1271,Robert Lecklin,"April 9, 2020",1, The podcast plays for a couple of minutes before it starts to buffer (even though the episode is downloaded) The buffering never ends and only way to play is shipping forward and backward again
1272,Anime Tamil,"April 20, 2020",5," I think its the best app to listen to podcasts and it's always been better with Google Podcast. Just play the talk, Colse your eyes and just feel it."
1273,Dewan Abdullah Al Noman,"April 21, 2020",5, I was very pleased to discover how much info this app can get you. I am a lazy reader so i prefer listening. This app is giving me just what i need. Thanks to Google team!
1274,Denny Jaynes,"April 26, 2020",4, App is good except you cannot choose a storage location. Automatically stored to device memory. I would like to store on the SD card.
1275,Badger UK90,"April 26, 2020",1," Just seems so cluttered, dashboard all over the place, and recently started just randomly pausing through episodes. Often looses the queued list too, I gave up."
1276,Kathleen Dano,"April 24, 2020",1," This current update is terrible. Absolutely loved PREVIOUS version. Lost several aspects that made the previous version great. Go back to previous version, Google. Please."
1277,T1Texas Aggie,"April 30, 2020",5," Amazing! I love that podcasts are for everyone! (Kid, Adult,elder, and so much more!!) Totally recommend!! (Also parents it has an adult feture for your children!)"
1278,Tylerre Potter,"April 8, 2020",1," Used to be great. Now it's cluttered and confusing, harder to use, and podcasts stop playing and say buffering after a few minutes."
1279,A Google user,"March 31, 2020",4," It's pretty basic. It's a neat and clean interface. Perfect that way. A big issue for me is that there's no now playing notification in the notification shade or lock screen like music players do, if I disable 'Google' app notifications"
1280,Elizabeth Alcinoe,"March 25, 2020",2," I had all my subscriptions organized, now they are disorganized and difficult to find. Bring back the home screen. Get some UI people who believe that content should be organized in a rational manner."
1281,Ed Crain,"March 31, 2020",3," Alas, the honeymoon ends. As with many products across history, this app has passed is best and is headed to it's most complicated. Honestly, the previous version had more utility and usefulness. Pom poms for effort. Boos for accomplishment."
1282,A Google user,"April 9, 2020",4, Bug report: podcasts stop after 2:11. Then hang at buffering. Add ratings & reviews. Enable landscape mode for better fine tuned seeking. Dark mode doesn't work properly. The app keeps defaulting back to light.
1283,Chip Christian,"April 8, 2020",4, Improving. I still don't understand why it doesn't have all the podcasts yet that Google Play Music does. The Many Moods of Ben Vaughn in particular.
1284,Michael,"March 27, 2020",2, Used to be my favourite podcast app. The new 2020 layout is a step in the wrong direction. New podcast episodes don't always arrive on schedule compared to other providers. Going back to Pocket Cast.
1285,Jamal Mousa,"April 21, 2020",1, It got 1 star only because the notification won't go away unless I force kill the app. Resolve that Google and you'll get 5 stars! Update: now many podcasts are not being updated
1286,axl street,"April 28, 2020",5," The app automatically goes to the older episode and doesn't let you filter the content, do i have to scroll 1000+ episodes of the Joe Rogan Experience to get to the latest one ? Please fix that!"
1287,Jonathan Marks,"March 26, 2020",1, While the app still seems to function well. I DO NOT LIKE THE NEW HOME PAGE LAYOUT! It forces me to have to go hunt my favorite shows by assuming I want to listen to everything new from all shows I subscribe to!
1288,Art Vandelay,"March 8, 2020",5," Works great, I like being able to download episodes, I like the sleep feature, and it is easy to find episodes of my favorite channel that I may have missed."
1289,Ryan Lai,"March 20, 2020",5," This app is so easy to use, first thing to show up I'd a damn search bar. HOW HARD WAS THAT? It allows me to play my weekly podcasts while doing homework with the screen off... It's just great."
1290,Rastislav Dokupil,"March 26, 2020",3, It used to be my most popular app ever. But today's update completely ruined the way I used the app. It's not possible to organize the channels any more. Looking for a replacement...
1291,Lynnette Dornak,"March 27, 2020",1," I loved this until the most recent update. Now it is horrible. I never leave reviews, that is how much I hate the new format. Please give us back a way to see the matrix format rather than a line of podcasts"
1292,Weston Cook,"March 30, 2020",5," Great platform so far. I will say... Like others I loved the old platform, it was easy to learn and navigate thru, and was a clean look. Please bring it back."
1293,Captain Crohns,"March 30, 2020",1, even on episodes that I have downloaded they will start to buffer after a couple of minutes and not allow me to listen.I will have to completely restart the app just to be able to listen to a couple more minutes.
1294,Candice Attfield,"April 13, 2020",4," I am not a fan of the new update, I liked it when it would just play through to the next pod cast while I am doing things and listening."
1295,Philippe Renaud,"March 29, 2020",3, Better but not there yet. No playlists Can't hide played episodes Cant see all subscriptions on home page. It needs two clicks to go go to subscriptions No badge with number for new episodes Can't manually add rss feeds. See you later google podcasts...
1296,Sarah Rogers,"March 28, 2020",1," The new UI stresses me out. I haven't been listening to podcasts as much because the thought of trying to find anything, or figuring it out causes anxiety. Why change something when people need some comfort in the normal at this time?"
1297,Kevin G,"March 29, 2020",1, Why did you change the layout? It's so much harder to see because everything's right in your face. That was the reason I don't use spotify for podcasts. The old layout was much easier and quicker to find what you want to listen to.
1298,Davin Karunanayake,"March 30, 2020",5," Sent feedback some time ago, and pretty much all of those things have been addressed. It's really amazing to know that the Google Podcasts team is listening!! Keep it up💯"
1299,Abdullah Amin,"March 30, 2020",5," Wonderful app, very easy and smooth. I really love this app, and I listen to my favorite podcasts everybody. Beautiful and good looking interface. Thanks from Google for making such a great app."
1300,Jeffrey Blevins,"March 31, 2020",2," Like the App, absolutely do not like the update that changed the appearance. Grid style list of apps was main reason the app was easy to use. Will go back to other apps for podcast due to lack of ease of use."
1301,Christopher Crammond,"March 30, 2020",1," This app is awful! The UI is less than optimal and the playback experience is terrible. The audio stops due to buffering, but even if you download the podcast and run in airplane mode. Avoid this podcast app."
1302,Kirsten Jensen,"April 3, 2020",1," Horrible set up after new update. I liked the set up before, it was easier to see what podcasts have new episodes. New layout is horrible and hard to navigate"
1303,Bryan Sundin,"April 3, 2020",1, New update is harder to find podcast. Also podcast stop playing after a few seconds if connected to cell service since update. Unusable. Just downloaded a different app.
1304,Sophie Ryder,"April 6, 2020",5," I've been looking for decent android podcast app for ages. Can't believe it took Google this long to make their own! Does everything I want a podcast app to do. Search for podcasts, subscribe to podcasts and play podcasts. Simple."
1305,Garth Tissington,"April 10, 2020",2, Works fine. But they have just released a new version that is much more cumbersome. The previous version was very easy to use but this new one is a big step backward
1306,Christian Brown,"April 11, 2020",4," Very friendly user interface, would like it to be visually more appealing. Lots of low-contrast situations with text."
1307,Yuri Ussar D'Andria,"April 15, 2020",5," This is google garanteed podcast app, where you can find pretty much anything you can think of For free. Great dark theme, great implementation with Samsung Dex, nice work here."
1308,divine flow,"April 17, 2020",5," Podcasts are captivating, entertaining and so much more informative. This app doesn't have any problem or any bug and easy to use"
1309,Samuel Tebandeke,"April 15, 2020",5, The app functions very efficiently and downloads are easy to set up and queue. Loving how simple the interface is and everything is intuitive.
1310,Katie Gill,"April 18, 2020",3," The app generally works fine but has a terrible tendency to occasionally mark things I've played as unplayed. As someone who listens to a lot of backlog episodes, this is annoying as heck."
1311,LeRoy Reynolds,"April 19, 2020",5," Gives me my podcast subscriptions in one place with an intuitive, convenient, and easy to use interface."
1312,Ananya Maurya,"April 27, 2020",5, Quite Small in Size but Pack a lot of features... Loved the way it works... I can listen to My Favorite podcasts... And Can Add it to Google Routine to Start with the Alarm... Quite Nice...😁
1313,Umair Shah,"April 24, 2020",1," Keeps buffering since last update. Even after updating the Google app, issue is not resolved. Please fix the issue before i switch to some other app."
1314,Allison Beerntsen,"April 28, 2020",4, Love the playlist option because I listen to several different shows I can add new episodes and it will go through episodes of different shows to mix things up.
1315,Edward Baxter,"April 29, 2020",3," Love the UX, UI, and it's intuitive to find podcasts. Would up this review to 5 stars if I could add podcasts via a private RSS feed like what people can get from certain Patreon services"
1316,Jennifer Collins,"April 29, 2020",5, Love it! I hadn't ventured into the world of podcasts before but this so makes it soooooo easy. I'm hooked!
1317,Christopher Cochrane,"March 27, 2020",1, The new update is really unorganised. The old version had seperate tabs for newly released podcasts you subcribed to and then a tab for currently listening to. All on the front page. This now is more like the spotify layout and is messy!😭
1318,A Google user,"April 6, 2020",5, Love love the new interface. The only missing feature is the ability to favorite and save an episode for future reference.
1319,Josh Messer,"March 29, 2020",2, All the podcasts that I love in one spot. Update: New update is terrible grid view was so much better. I read the rationale btw. Sometime progree for the sake of progress isn't the way to go.
1320,Max Friend,"March 27, 2020",1, Latest update (March 2020) makes it borderline unusable. You can no longer scroll through your pages of subscriptions like you should be able to. Dropped from 5 stars to 1 until fixed.
1321,Sonal Ranjan,"March 12, 2020",5, Essential tool for managimg my tech information sources. I get my daily dosage of guided meditation through podcasts too. The app has a neat interface that uplevels new episodes from subscribed podcasts - recommends new podcasts based on interests.
1322,Ahmed Mansour,"March 4, 2020",4, Clean simple. Sometimes jumps from spot you stop listening at when phone is restarted or something. Feature requests. Private podcasts. No data mode to make sure that the app plays only episodes that I downloaded
1323,Elizabeth Regalado,"March 10, 2020",4," Use it all the time. Wish it was meant to subscribe more though. Hate that I have to scroll for everything- wish I could make categories or they were pre-sorted by category- i.e. true crime, news, comedy, etc."
1324,Darien Delgado,"March 9, 2020",5," Great and convenient whenever I want to listen to my favorite podcasts, I like how you can download them so you don't need to waste data to listen to them while on the road or on vacation."
1325,Saket Agarwal,"March 27, 2020",2, Hate new experiences. That's why I don't invest in google products. Too much experimentation. Thank you for making me feel like a product and destroying a great simple app. At least bring back the grid of podcast and do not reorder my podcasts.
1326,William Hadden,"March 21, 2020",5," Enjoying the ability to listen to great content at any time. The ability to speed up the podcast is fantastic, especially when listening to some multiple times."
1327,Joy,"April 8, 2020",3, Recently the dark mode feature keeps switching back to light mode. The app has been really good for me besides that now happening. Hope you can fix it soon.
1328,Mr Hak Daddy Stevens,"March 26, 2020",4," Love the new update. Please add the ability to download podcasts to sd card. Also ability to make your own podcast playlists, interact with podcast producers and push notifications with new podcasts and this will be a 5 star app!"
1329,Anthony Pietrantonio,"March 26, 2020",4, It's good if you like not having some podcasts on it that are on others. I love BBC global news and it isn't on this app. If they made it so we could get it I'd definitely be using this app
1330,Duncan Taylor,"March 27, 2020",2," It was already a little tricky to navigate, now they've changed the layout it's even harder. I wouldn't be surprised if they're deliberately driving users on to other apps so they can stop supporting this one."
1331,Michael Skarda,"March 27, 2020",1, New update is awful. Trying to find the podcast I want to listen too is harder than it used to be. Can I revert to the older version? Mine won't let me go backwards on updates it just keeps updating to this new version that is awful.
1332,Steven Wyatt,"March 27, 2020",4," The newest update is full of great improvements. However, you should be able to create playlists and also have a ""mark as played "" button on the home page instead of having to go through multiple steps to find this option."
1333,HK Smith,"March 30, 2020",2," Whoa. Not a fan of the new interface. Not user-friendly at all for keeping track of subscriptions and episodes 😖 A shame, because I recently introduced a podcast novice library patron to your platform."
1334,Justin Bonomo,"March 31, 2020",1, I hate the new layout and the podcasts stop for no reason! I have to completely back out of the all and close it to get it to restart and then continues to do it every 10 minutes or so.
1335,Chris Rigby,"March 31, 2020",2, I've never really used this app to its full potential (and I'm fairly happy with that). The latest update has made it so I can't tell which episodes I've already listened to. Rather frustrating
1336,Eoin Gorman,"April 1, 2020",2, Used to have a great layout to easily get to the podcast you want. But now the app shows lists and lists of different episodes which makes it difficult to navigate through.
1337,Justin Baker,"April 2, 2020",5," The app is just so easy to use. It takes pretty much no space since it's built into the Google app. And with all the new improvements, it's just getting better and better."
1338,Robert Capps,"April 3, 2020",4, This doesn't have all the bells and whistles or cool features other podcast apps have but this is the most consistent as far as dependability and updates.
1339,Cindy Sumner,"April 5, 2020",1, I HATE the new update. It was streamlined and easy to locate my favorite podcasts and now it's a jumbled mess. I'm looking for another podcast app to replace this one now.
1340,Fio T,"April 6, 2020",1," Hate the new UI, and before the Google team tells me to check out the handy guide I already did it doesn't change the fact that the new UI is hot garbage from a dumpster fire. I already submitted feedback in the app telling you I hate it."
1341,Dhruv,"April 2, 2020",5," It's phenomenal now. It's a lightweight app that has the essential features. I love the new UI. Its simple, clean, very easy to navigate."
1342,Sarah Williams,"April 5, 2020",4," This app is brilliant - no glitches, good quality and no ads. One thing I'd love is to be able to choose how my homepage looks so I can navigate to which podcast I want quicker- maybe in the next update?"
1343,Nelu Mbingu,"April 6, 2020",5, I love podcasts! GP is super easy to use and streamlined. Makes me love podcasts even more. I also love being able to download.
1344,Micah Breedlove,"April 12, 2020",4, Great app for podcasts. Simple interface. Sometimes if I pause the app when I start back up it will play for about 30 seconds then it just craps out. Other than that I like it
1345,Pedro Marinho,"April 12, 2020",3," After uptade the experience is worst. Was better that I could organise my Podcasts Channels according to my preference and it maintain the order, now don't have organisation and the order change according to my use. The only positive upgrade was the possibility to create my own queue."
1346,Rohit Kumar,"April 12, 2020",4, It is skipping 'seconds' even at 1.0 speed. Please take a look at it. It is affecting our listening experience.
1347,SHIVANI YADAV,"April 11, 2020",4, So much nice stuff i can hear here instead of so much noise out. Would appreciate if there is some way to add them to a playlist.
1348,Nima Samimi,"April 19, 2020",5," This new update was a very successful one, thanks for that. Its way fastest process to create a play queue, light weight fast app."
1349,Arya Majumder,"April 22, 2020",5, Love This Google Podcasts Player... Maybe All Channels Are Available I Don't Know 😅 But It's Bit Difficult To Found Your Favourite One... Because As Default It Shows Some Podcast From World.😖💩 But I Need Hindi Podcasts Only So Go And Search... And You Will Found Them
1350,Timothy Riley,"April 22, 2020",4," The cast button could be more discoverable (maybe have it persist everywhere? It's only on the first activity screen), but the app is otherwise good"
1351,tha county,"April 27, 2020",1, The redesign is terrible. Impossible to find a podcast with the tiny icons at the top. Even with a Pixel 4 XL I have issues with it randomly force closing itself.
1352,Colby Moorberg,"April 29, 2020",3," How is there not a cast button?! The is a Google branded podcast app, yet I can't easily cast the studio to my Google Home speaker. That's just silly."
1353,ExtCab _ n8,"April 30, 2020",5," No lag, love that you're able to speed up or slow down. App does not use much battery life as it runs in the background!!"
1354,Christian Steiner,"March 28, 2020",1, New version lost all the charm of the old one. The overview of subscribed podcasts was the USP of this app and is gone now. There's no reason not to use any other podcast player now.
1355,Christano Meredith,"April 1, 2020",5, Good can be better. Need a option to download podcast to memory card and also to be able to only play my download items. From previous reviews. A queue is now added. I like the new improvements
1356,Raymond Fineron,"April 4, 2020",1," Horrible new interface. Also, I can't find certain podcasts that I can easily find on the Google Play Music app, specifically the The Chicago Way with John Kass (WGN Radio)."
1357,Branden McDonald,"March 27, 2020",5," Wow, okay! -3 stars to 5- Latest update fixed all the major issues. Now has auto download, playlist (queue), and a really cool running list of the latest podcasts. Finally.. the back button looks like a back button. Great redesign."
1358,Dagoberto Ruiz,"April 2, 2020",5, This is a great app for podcasts. It would be even better if we could rate a podcast and a channel. Love the queue feature!
1359,Ty Walker,"March 25, 2020",1," New redesign is trash. Single line scrolling on the top through all your subscriptions is terrible. Who thought this was a good idea?! Finding a new app now. Thanks for nothing google, you had a great app and you had to screw with it"
1360,Steve Lisbin,"March 23, 2020",5," So far I really like it. I decided to try it because my current app, Pocket Cast, has been getting slow to open and start casting. This app is quick and easy (so far, just started using it)."
1361,Emmanuela Kenfack,"March 24, 2020",5, Great App! It allows me to navigate costlessly through some of my favorite hosts. I also love that you can download the audios on cloud memory for listening when there is no more available data...
1362,Joan Wildfield,"March 24, 2020",5," Reliable, usually very good sound, #56 was not as good but maybe it was a froggy voice. I want it to keep going and to send these messages to all my relatives & friends."
1363,Joel Rosenblatt,"March 26, 2020",2," I like the features of the new update, but ever since I updated buffering hangs. I have to force stop the app, and restart it, to be able to continue listening."
1364,Miles Hookey,"March 28, 2020",1," I'm very unimpressed with the update. You can no longer go directly to the next episode with your phone, nor does it automatically go to the next episode either. Please fix this asap!"
1365,Johnathan Heath,"March 27, 2020",1," New update, changed the menu and made it cluttered. They added an extra hundred podcasts to my list not just the ones that are most recent but all the ones I listen to months and months ago. New update sucks."
1366,Steve Shumate,"March 29, 2020",2," Loved the app and was glad to see new features slowly roll out like sleep timer. That being said the new ui is awful. The previous version was much cleaner, intuitive, and efficient in navigation."
1367,Nerdsick!,"March 27, 2020",3, Has a problem where it switches to light mode if you have it set to dark mode when you go back into the app from the notification. Please fix. Other than that this is my go-to podcast app.
1368,Rick Fuerman,"March 29, 2020",2, Hate the new UI. Before it was very easy to see new episodes and ones I downloaded. Now I just see a bunch of podcasts. What happened to the ones I downloaded? Was a great app before but I'm switching to Spotify
1369,cam reeder,"March 27, 2020",1," The old layout was much easier to find all the new episodes in one place. Was quick,simple and easy. Give an option to keep the old layout in a tab."
1370,Matt Castleberry,"March 29, 2020",2," The ""new"" layout makes it hard to find what podcast I want. I had everything arranged in order of the way I wanted to listen, and it completely screwed that up."
1371,Andrew Schiffer,"April 2, 2020",1, The new update is TERRIBLE. I can see all my shows on the same page and I hate the section where it says explore topics in this episode. Looking for a new podcast app.
1372,John,"April 1, 2020",1," This ""update"" sucks. I like the darker theme but the podcasts don't even play consecutively. This is kind of important when driving. Obviously, the podcast app development didn't have any input from someone who used it...bad UI and bad UX."
1373,Alex G,"April 2, 2020",2, New layout update in late March is terrible. Will be downloading another podcast app. I hope they move back to the grid... Or at least offer a way to switch to the old layout.
1374,Jose Gonzalez,"April 5, 2020",4, Great app not alot of people knew of this app including myself but I heard it because of a show on the radio and they had several ways to hear and they had a podcast on this app.
1375,Ian Renton,"April 4, 2020",1," Was 5 star worthy but recent bug fix put a new one in, playback randomly stops a minute or two in and app has to be restarted, but will still stop anyway. App is unusable now"
1376,George Cuba,"April 5, 2020",4," Main complaint is not having podcasts listed out first, followed by relevant episodes during a search. Minor complaint is not having a podcast or two listen that I like."
1377,Susan Mathis,"April 15, 2020",5, Wonderful!! I can and do play it all night. Helps so much! Amazing stories and such good narrators with soothing voices.
1378,Massimo Palmisciano,"April 19, 2020",2," Honestly, it was working so well but with the new update some podcasts just keep stopping and also the new layout is absolutely shocking and not intuitive at all"
1379,Matthew,"April 18, 2020",1," No way to add a Podcast by URL. This makes it impossible to listen to premium content, which means this app is of no use to me."
1380,Ian Wellins,"April 19, 2020",5," So easy to use, settings are very straightforward. Auto or manual, whatever your preference."
1381,Jason Esquivel,"April 20, 2020",3, Wish the app would auto play subscribed content. I'm a truck driver and can't just click a new podcast if the only ones in the queue are just a few minutes long.
1382,Baxışoff,"April 25, 2020",3, It stops when I receive from other apps and begins when notification ends. It bothers me a lot. Specially when someone send me serial messages after every word on whatsapp.
1383,Megan Moilanen,"April 29, 2020",4, So glad I can custom playlist now but I wish if I start a new episode I didn't have to add the other episode back. I also really wish it would stop losing my played episodes
1384,Neil Churgin,"April 30, 2020",4," Decent podcast app... Easy to use, maybe not all the bells and whistles, but that is what I like"
1385,Nicholas Farrar,"March 27, 2020",1," How come there's no way to import RSS feeds? Also, I hate the new layout. Takes much longer to go through your channels, and very easy to accidentally refresh the page. Please, please change."
1386,Nomad Skateboarding,"February 27, 2020",2," Update: 2 star. Would be 4 if podcasts wasn't a part of Assistant. Every time you use voice or Bluetooth to resume music, etc, it will always just play Podcasts. So use a great integrated app, or use everything else on my phone with audio..."
1387,Michiel van der Meulen,"March 2, 2020",4," beginning to be a fluid to operate and reliable player, with only battery usage to complain about (playing podcasts without pressing download first makes the app use network extensively) another miss: unable to add e.g. the Slate subscription feed"
1388,James Mock,"April 5, 2020",1, The new update to the UI is terrible definitely could have made it a little more user friendly instead of making it difficult find what you are looking for.
1389,phil elzerman,"April 6, 2020",1," As said by others, apps only play a few minutes before getting stuck 'buffering' new inerface isnt as intuitive. Rollback the player code at least please!"
1390,Hazart,"March 5, 2020",4, I can not switch to another records of podcasts. It's keeping play the same when I am trying to move on and press to play button of the next records. Upd: After Google app update Podcasts works fine.
1391,BLACKBURNER,"April 21, 2020",2, The audio stops and buffers indefinitely even for downloaded podcasts. I can skip forward a bit and then it turns back to normal.
1392,Dakota Murphy,"February 27, 2020",5," I absolutely love that the podcasts are free and that you can find podcasts in any and all areas that you are interested in. I am personally a fan of true crime podcasts and let me tell you, Google podcast has a lot of them"
1393,Sean Hickey,"March 9, 2020",3, Functional and easy to use but very basic. No playlist functions. Long journey to manually download a podcast. Could definitely use some other features.
1394,Ann,"March 9, 2020",3," The subscribed podcasts interface could be better. I would really like to focus on the podcasts I like. Also, a dark mode and an Android player WIDGET are things I would love to see added."
1395,Alan Standley,"March 13, 2020",5, This to me is a great way to listen to something while doing something like driving / working unlike Tv which takes full attention Podcast Do-not it's a great app for getting all pod makers in one and available for free.
1396,Fareedah Ameen,"March 16, 2020",5, An excellent app for Android users who are Podcast lovers. It's so easy to use and takes up very little space on your phone storage. You can literally find any podcast channel you want to listen to on here.
1397,Nabeel Muaddi,"March 25, 2020",3," I liked it better before the update and new UI. The only reason I use it is b/c it's so well integrated with my other Google products, but it's still a close 2nd to Podbean."
1398,Niraj Kapasi,"March 25, 2020",2, Would have given a better rating if 1. I receive notification from the app when a new podcast is released for the channels subscribed and 2. I am unable to swipe away the notification even after finishing the podcast on Android 9. Please fix this
1399,Stephen Keaton,"March 27, 2020",3, I really dislike the new layout! I don't like only being able to see the podcast I'm subscribed to by scrolling at the top. The majority of my screen now is recent episodes.
1400,Edric Cheong,"March 27, 2020",1," I could live with not having the controls on my notifications shade. At least it plays. After the recent update, it crashes each time I try to play a podcast."
1401,Glenn Gould,"March 27, 2020",1," Takes for ever to buffer any podcast. Really annoying flaw. Also, played podcasts or ones that you mark as played stay on your playlist forever so it takes longer to find unplayed podcasts. Just a bad player."
1402,Nathan Brady,"March 30, 2020",1, Marked as Played doesn't work reliably in the latest release. The app has to be terminated and reopened to mark the episode as played. It also no longer supports autoplay of the next episode.
1403,Andy Kidd,"April 22, 2020",1, The latest update no longer auto plays episodes in a series. Something that is very important especially while driving.
1404,Maurice Hall,"April 1, 2020",1, This was my favorite podcast app until the lastest redesign. The app now buffers on downloaded podcast couple of minutes and won't stop until I force close it and reopen it. I'm going back to pocket cast until this gets it stuff together
1405,John Dorsi,"April 1, 2020",1," The UI redesign is horrible! It's way more difficult to navigate. Definitely, not user friendly anymore."
1406,Zachary Soh,"April 4, 2020",1, Bring back the old layout! The grid view was what I loved most and now it's just annoying to have to scroll so much just to see what podcasts I have
1407,Devin Roza,"April 3, 2020",2, Previous interface was much better. With new interface it's difficult to continue podcasts from where you were. Am switching to another app.
1408,shafira,"April 7, 2020",5," The UI is super simple & minimalist, it's lite, and including the info that maybe we never know we need in every episodes of podcast. Love it!"
1409,Syed Farhan,"April 7, 2020",1, New UI ruined the UX. Disoverability is ok but making it difficult to find podcasts I'm already subscribed to was a terrible idea. Assuming what I want to listen it is error prone.
1410,Kylie Clarke,"April 11, 2020",3, Since updating the auto play feature no longer works and the layout makes it so hard to find things. Still an awesome catalogue of options.
1411,T.S. Pendlebury,"April 10, 2020",2, Before I didn't have any issues and all of a sudden downloaded podcasts will not play and will get stuck endlessly buffering. Why do downloaded files even need buffering?
1412,Anthony Storey,"April 13, 2020",2," Great app, but the theme keeps reverting to light, and I have to manually change it back to dark or to follow system. Will update once this gets fixed"
1413,Lynn Hooks,"April 16, 2020",1, Keeps dropping in the middle of episodes even when I download. I have to fast forward and then miss whatever part it stopped on. It never recovers
1414,Thomas Wright,"April 22, 2020",1, I download podcasts and then it wont/cant play them. It's like it cant find them. Red question mark shows up. Real pain in the butt.
1415,Levi misholovin,"April 27, 2020",1, The new update is a total disaster. My biggest issue is I can't listen continuously. This used to be my podcast app i guess I need to find a new one
1416,Salman M M,"May 1, 2020",3, It was all going well. But then it stopped working. I can't play or download podcasts. Then I reinstalled it. Then it became working again.
1417,Cal Graves,"April 30, 2020",4," I love that this app gives me access to all the podcasts I enjoy, including those I used to listen to via Apple's podcasts when I used to have an iPhone."
1418,Jef Van Laer,"May 1, 2020",4, Does what you'd expect. Clean interface. Only thing I'm missing is the ability to queue up podcasts for when the current one ends.
1419,Carlos Flores,"March 7, 2020",3," Everything was ok until recently, a persistent notification, even after closing the app. The only option at the moment is to restart the phone to make it go away."
1420,Kyle Doering,"April 7, 2020",2, Auto-Download only downloads once you open the app. Cast button is now buried under multiple menus. Volume while casting buried even further under cast button.
1421,S K PUNEETH KUMAR,"April 25, 2020",1, Won't rotate. No auto-generated transcripts. Very janky. Notifications are not black. I keep getting notifications from podcasts even after unsubscribing.
1422,dedpixl Roy,"March 27, 2020",1, New update makes the User experience very foreign for me I don't how it cannot be reverted or customized to suit someone's taste. It's hard for me to get what I like from my subscriptions.
1423,cebile balufu,"March 30, 2020",5," My first podcast experience, i guess all i want is the option to download podcasts to external device... Well I like the new design plus it makes making a playlist much much easier... Keep up with the improvements"
1424,Ricardo Sundaram,"April 9, 2020",5, Theres been an update to the layout which i find a lot more simple and easy to use. Tried different apps before but this is the best so far.
1425,T. Baker,"March 4, 2020",4, I use this app almost daily to get the Word of God in my spirit. Using podcasts of evangelists and preachers. For entertainment like wait wait don't tell me; and for parenting help. I live that I can access all these things from one place.
1426,Mark Hooper,"March 4, 2020",5," Revolutionary, best podcasting op by far, and I've tried them all. Rewind and fast forward from the lock screen, and everything is incredibly sensible. Superb."
1427,ValarieShea,"March 4, 2020",5, This is the best podcast app I've ever used. It's so simple and clean. I can see many of the shows I listen to on the home page and can see what episodes I haven't finished along with what's new. Highly recommend this app.
1428,Daniel LeTexier,"March 8, 2020",5, I love this app. Has almost all the podcasts I enjoy to listen to in one place. Interface is clean and works well. Love that offline download is simple and works.
1429,Jeff Hewartson,"March 12, 2020",3," Works well for the most part, but doesnt have a way to easily reset episodes after they have been listened to. Makes relistening difficult and frustrating"
1430,Stephen Hall,"March 12, 2020",3," Decent basic podcast app. One thing I hate is that it forces a persistent notification showing the last-played item, which I can't remove even by blocking app notifications in settings. Infuriating."
1431,Neeharika kanaka rao,"March 17, 2020",5, Hey Google podcast! Literally I'm enjoying a lot. It's so nice to hear rather than watching some of those. One thing is lacking. I wish there will be some audiobooks which r renowned
1432,Sheryar Khan,"April 7, 2020",5," Wow it actually happened. Hello 'Night Mode'. Thanks guys, love the app, and definitely love the new feature. My eyes thank you :) -- *Previous Review: Desperately needs a night mode option on this app."
1433,Anand P,"March 23, 2020",3, Need the following features really bad: 1. Ability to create custom playlists 2. Good integration with Google home 3. Next episode doesn't play automatically if you have sorted latest episode on top
1434,Rebecca Knaak,"March 23, 2020",4," It's okay but the podcasts will not leave my notification bar no matter how many times I close the app, force it to stop, and disable notifications from it. It's driving me nuts"
1435,J Med,"March 28, 2020",1," Was the best, now unusable since update. One line to scroll through for all of my podcasts lol. Terrible. Who ever designed this obviously never used the app. It was perfect, and you ruined it. Zero stars."
1436,Ren Tetrault,"March 27, 2020",4, Idea to kick up podcast apps in general. For us insomniacs. Ability to set timer 1 and 2. I like to listen to a political or spooky podcast fkr 20 mins. Then it would be nice for ot to auto switch to asmr rain! ZzZzz . Havent seen this kinds featurr anywherre. Setting switch to this podcast timer.
1437,Benjamin Fisk,"March 29, 2020",3," Really disappointing in the recent update to the layout. I had it set to easily access the podcasts I was interested in, and now it's quite a hassle to scroll through."
1438,Michael Lu,"March 27, 2020",1, The new ui is so bad. Old version is 5 star. But the current update is making the organization of podcasts so messy and inefficient. Do not agree the logic of new ui. Will change to 5 star if I can use old version.
1439,Andrew Boyles,"March 30, 2020",4, Only been using it for a couple of weeks but so far so good. I don't know enough about podcast apps to give it a 5 star rating so for now it's a 4. Not unhappy with it in any way...yet :-)
1440,Courtney Barr,"April 1, 2020",2," I DO NOT like the new update. It is not as organized as the previous version. I liked the ""In Progress Section"" and now that is gone."
1441,Sarah Maslovskis,"April 2, 2020",3, I much prefer the user interface that Google Play Music offers. Much more intuitive and easier to find/change settings.
1442,Warwick Varley,"April 6, 2020",3," Works great till it hangs, which it will do every few mins. Doesn't matter if the podcast has been downloaded either. Have to use player such as vlc to play downloaded files. Unusable so have uninstaled."
1443,Ivan Fuentes,"April 3, 2020",4," I like this app, the onky detail i would change is the search option. Im really stupid bc I always lose it. I dont know, something to make it more notorious"
1444,Kelly,"April 6, 2020",1," This was my favorite, but with the new update, it is hard to use and I hate it. So much scrolling, so much not being able to find my favorites."
1445,Suniti Ray,"April 4, 2020",2, Could you please work on this new version ...it is really very troublesome.... sometimes it just stops .... enough to lose interest on the playing content.. thanks ....
1446,Kayla Togonon,"April 10, 2020",5," I love how its free, and its contents are good, and always recommends me stuff, I never run out of stuff to listen to."
1447,Lewis Maurer,"April 9, 2020",4, Works well except once you start listening the podcast continues in a widow at the bottom of the page even when completed and deleted from device until you start another podcast.
1448,John Willson,"April 9, 2020",1," I need a ""mark ALL played"" option asap. I'm not going through years worth of podcasts to get them off my home list. It'll be easier to just switch to another app."
1449,Dianna Wilkins,"April 12, 2020",5, Sitting by the pool self quarantine and no ID on the TV. Bad comcast/Infiniti took it off my channels. But thankfully I now listen to your podcast and I love it thanks!
1450,Stephen Ronning,"April 14, 2020",5," Finally worth giving 5 stars. Google had done a great job integrating the features so desperately needed. Beautiful interface, and has queues!!"
1451,Andrea Chymdii,"April 18, 2020",5, It's a great way to catch up on your favourite podcasts. The user interface is really good and clean. I only wish downloads could last longer than 30 days.
1452,Dinesh D,"April 15, 2020",5, Very simple and easy to use. Low space with all required options and features for a podcast.
1453,Carl Rowlinson,"April 20, 2020",4," Overall great. Could use a few layout tweaks and bug fixes, but it's been pretty enjoyable so far. Casting drops out more often than I'd like hence 4 stars"
1454,Will Deasy,"April 20, 2020",1, Unusable. Forgets where you are up to. If you stop playing on a speaker then starts up on your phone.
1455,Adam McCormack,"April 24, 2020",2," Not picking up latest podcasts. Host site shows and plays latest podcasts, still not available in this app... Which kind of defeats the purpose of it. Edit, is there a 400 podcast limit?"
1456,Gaurav Gandhi,"April 27, 2020",2, The app crashes if it runs for more than 15mins. It crashed even when I tried to give a feedback on the app about it crashing repeatedly....
1457,Master Lucas Hall,"April 29, 2020",5, It is a wonderful app that is easy to use and the suggestions for other podcasts that it offered me were right up my alley.
1458,John Jennings,"March 29, 2020",1, I don't like the new UI. I want to see shortcuts to as many as possible of my subscribed podcasts on the homepage without the need to scroll; I don't want to see a feed of latest episodes.
1459,Stephen Porter,"March 27, 2020",1, I will be looking for a new podcast app after the change of format from yesterday. It is now much harder to navigate through all my different podcasts. Way to screw up an app.
1460,Raiyan Talkhani,"March 27, 2020",1," Could we have a display where is shows all the podcast channels I have subscribed to? It was meh before but now it's an unorganized Chaos. Edit: okay I read the blog post, it does make sense... It's gonna take time to get used to the new format again, it's a radical change from the last one. And tha...Full ReviewCould we have a display where is shows all the podcast channels I have subscribed to? It was meh before but now it's an unorganized Chaos. Edit: okay I read the blog post, it does make sense... It's gonna take time to get used to the new format again, it's a radical change from the last one. And thanks for the response."
1461,A Google user,"April 14, 2020",5, UPDATE- I recind my complaints about the new format. The main page and everything about Google Podcast App is very slick and well thought out.
1462,Michael Talbot,"March 29, 2020",5," I like how simple this app is. Auto download is the only additional feature I would definitely like to see. The new features recently introduced, like the queue, are a welcome set of improvements."
1463,Joshua Larmore,"March 30, 2020",4," I've enjoyed the simplicity of the app, but when I'm done listening to a podcast, it won't leave my notification bar. It would be 5 stars otherwise."
1464,Mohamad Nayal,"April 9, 2020",3, The fact that I can't clear stuff out of my reccomended or go to a list of all my podcasts that I regularly listen to forces me to unsubscribe from podcasts that I occasionally listen to to declutter
1465,Mykhaylo Shumko,"April 16, 2020",3, Not a fan of the left/right scrolling podcast list. The old format was much easier to use.
1466,Brendan Dennis,"March 30, 2020",5," UPDATED* - Gets 5*s from me now! Not only did they fix the disappearing downloads and added auto downloads to subscriptions, but also added dark theme and cleaned up the UI. MUCH better than before."
1467,Nelson Lukhele,"April 10, 2020",2," The old version worked just fine. Ever since I installed this version, it keeps on pausing everytime I start playing something."
1468,Anthony B,"April 8, 2020",4, The issue with the media player has been fixed. If there was an easier way to view all subscribed podcasts it would be better.
1469,Tracking Me Should Be Illegal,"March 3, 2020",4," When I close the app, the media controls remain open in my notification area. I'm updated to the latest version. The only way to remove them is by exiting the process from the advanced options in developer mode."
1470,Sander van Blitterswijk,"March 25, 2020",1, Just experienced the new update. From a good working app to a unusable one. All structured tiles moved to a long lineup. WHY?????? Its was good... now I have to find a new podcast app.
1471,Konstantin Svist,"April 21, 2020",3," Much better now with a queue, but queue is not easy to manage yet. Does not respect my time & sends a bunch of notifications for new items.."
1472,karthik pabba,"March 28, 2020",4, Hai all i just wanted the old ui in the app i just didn't like the new update. One thing that made me stick to the app is that the dashboard of channels i subscribed But now I can't see that felling makes me to dont even open the app Please bring back the dashboard of subscriptions please🙏🙏
1473,Paul Starnino,"April 14, 2020",2," I'm a rookie at this stuff, so I'm finding it quite difficult to do some of the most basic functions. They're not obvious and there doesn't seem to be a simple application map."
1474,Ashkan Hesaraki,"April 9, 2020",1," New UX is very bad, bad colour for completed, nothing is eye catching, going back goes to feed like thing instead of that subscribed list, bring the old one back...."
1475,Ryan Hertich,"March 5, 2020",1, Love the app but hate that after use the notification never goes away. After searching for answers it seems this has been an ongoing issue for years.
1476,Jeremy Green,"April 19, 2020",4, Pretty good app once you get used to the interface. Would sure be nice if it would allow subscriptions to paid pods via feed like others though.
1477,Aryan Farahani,"March 7, 2020",1, i think that this app is agreat app but nefor it brokes down i was listening to a podcast and my phone shut down and after that i turn on my phone and see its not working. i will be pleased if google solve the problem but its a perfect app
1478,Calebrated Gamer,"March 4, 2020",5," This is the way to do Podcasts. Great selection, very clean and organized and easy to pick through your selected list. Nothing else to say!"
1479,Mile Ristov,"March 15, 2020",5," It's great,free,and you have every podcast.I enjoy the app,but I don't know how to rate a podcast other then that it works fine,I love it"
1480,Jay Long,"March 16, 2020",5," Google's Podcasts is top notch definitely , a vast library of pretty much whatever your heart desires. My total go to off the bat is The Classic Metal show and everything Adam Corolla. I give this app a big Two Thumbs Up Thanks.👍👍"
1481,bradley eastham,"March 25, 2020",2, The latest update 3.24.20 makes the user interface experience absolutely awful. Revert back to the previous interface. It also doesn't autoplay the next episode like it previously did.
1482,robert scott,"March 29, 2020",1, This app used to work just fine now the latest update killed the playability. Now buffers and locks up and you've got to continually hit the fast forward button to start back up. Trash app!
1483,Jay C,"March 28, 2020",1," New update is awful. I prefer the previous layout. Seeing all the podcasts I'm following without any scrolling whatsoever is what I always liked about it and why I used it over spotify, which I pay for."
1484,Alex Daly,"April 1, 2020",1," New design is nice, but the app is way less reliable, can't get through a single podcast without it stopping to buffer indefinitely."
1485,Caleb Cox,"April 1, 2020",1, Not Good. The old app was mediocre. The update is just bad. I like to see my podcast and be able to move them around. Now there is no rythm or reason to the madness. Stop over thinking it. Your freaking Google.
1486,Erin DeLavan,"April 4, 2020",3, Since the update shows that have been downloaded now require constant buffering. Before the download I loved how simple and easy the app was to use.
1487,Daniel Nikolovski,"April 4, 2020",1, This new recent app update is terrible.... now can only view my subscribed podcasts in a single line. I like the older version where I could view all my subscribed podcasts easier....
1488,Petro Chernii,"April 4, 2020",5," Good and simple. There is huge field for possible additional functions, like bookmarks and navigation, but I'm afraid Google would never do them"
1489,Todd H,"April 7, 2020",5, I like the ease of use. Searching for podcasts and being able to quickly find new episodes is great.
1490,Edward Drummond,"April 4, 2020",1," I really enjoyed the podcast app, but the new look is horrendous and while there might be a rationale Im inclined to find a new app with a nicer interface if the layout isnt improved"
1491,Tony Torres,"April 4, 2020",4," So far its geeat, i listen when i walk amd connect to android auto and listen while i drive. I'd give it a five but im i think there is more i have not discovered with limited knowledge of tech stuff. Will update when i learn more."
1492,Chuck Just,"April 6, 2020",1," Going to a new app after the update. The old format was simplistic, and now it seems cluttered and difficult to navigate."
1493,Julio Dionisio,"April 8, 2020",5," The latest update makes this app 2x better. Having a queue makes the podcast listening process a lot easier, no need to switch between screens."
1494,rohimat riki,"April 13, 2020",1," It used to be good and then when i download a podcast, when i played it it alwad buffering in the middle,, i reinstal then instald the app but still the same. Please fix this"
1495,T Robertson,"April 14, 2020",4, This has definitely gotten a lot better. You can now auto download episodes and be notified of new ones very easily. The new UI is very nice as well.
1496,Kyle Sussman,"April 20, 2020",4, Good podcasts. Only wish there was a way to queue the podcasts so one can play after another and I don't need to load on up after the other
1497,Taylor Bartle,"April 24, 2020",3," Definitely still missing some key features. No sorting, no way to mark all episodes as played, no unread tags."
1498,Kieren Bell,"March 12, 2020",5," play continually stops. also, in recent episodes, you can only see the most recent from each podcast - if there are multiple recent episodes from one podcast, they are not visible"
1499,Delon Naidoo,"March 3, 2020",5, So easy. Very organised based on your genres. Always have the best options for you to choose from and such a wide variety of stations to customize your personal playlist with... Great experience.
1500,A Google user,"March 26, 2020",3," Love most of the updates, but new subscription view is terrible. Please move Subscription list to the Home tab and allow for customized grid display. Gladly give 5-stars with that single change."
1501,Francesco Ciuffarin,"March 5, 2020",3," Not very reliable, doesn't work properly with Chromecast devices, doesn't save the progress of the podcast.. It is a simple app as I wont, but it makes me angry for all those bugs 😡"
1502,A Google user,"April 4, 2020",4," New update added a lot of useful features, best podcast app I've used, sadly the auto download feature doesn't seem to correctly download new podcasts if two are uploaded together"
1503,A Google user,"March 5, 2020",4," Edit: -1⭐ because it erases your ""history"" of which you've listened to when it updates. Suggest disabling auto-update as a workaround. I found most my favourite podcasts easily, and i lile that it keeps track of my progress on episodes."
1504,Ryan W,"April 20, 2020",5, I have tried five or six different podcast apps and I feel this is the best one with the cleanest design and EZ controls. five stars!
1505,Vincent Lee,"March 13, 2020",3, I rated the app so it will stop asking me to rate the app. Layout is bad. Difficult to scroll through to find new podcasts. App won't stop showing notification even when episode is completed and download removed
1506,Vddeyyy,"March 28, 2020",5," This app desperately needs a dark mode. The user interface is easy to use and flows well, but the white background can cause eye strain after using it."
1507,Ashok Y,"April 5, 2020",4, I like this app. I have a problem though download files are stopped playing after 2min ...and when I open the app it's shows buffering..for a download file
1508,Eric Reeve,"March 6, 2020",2," Good app but very unstable since the last few updates. Crashes while listening often. Crashes when trying to send feedback. It's been great up until now, so YMMV. OnePlus 5T latest OS"
1509,Jason Racheotes,"March 11, 2020",5," Convenient, easy to change speed, subscribe to shows and stay up to date with your favorite shows. Every podcast I follow was on here. Zero complaints."
1510,thehowler,"March 20, 2020",5, You can find so many podcasts there it's a really good feeling to have all those things to listen to. Especially for me who is trying to improve their English listening skills.
1511,sourabh lahoti,"March 30, 2020",2, The new update has cluttered the app completely. Searching new podcast channels has become very difficult. The older version with white background and all was much clearer and easy to use
1512,Eric Treidel,"March 27, 2020",1, The redesign is awful... It used to be perfectly functional... Now it is a confusing jumbled mess... Seems to list podcasts in a totally random order... I will be switching to a different be podcast app
1513,Mark Ricker,"March 28, 2020",1," Redesign (3/26/2020) is HORRIBLE! i can't see my pods in a single pane, and the info that I don't care about takes up 80% of my screen. Niw I have to find a new podcast app."
1514,P L,"March 28, 2020",1, What happened? as of March 2020? The home page had all your podcast right in front of you! Now I have to scroll through to see my podcast. WHY DID GOOGLE CHANGE the LOOK and FEEL of this APP. ITS so ANNOYING!
1515,A.J. Thaler,"April 5, 2020",1, Podcast will play for about 2 minutes then stop and be unplayable. This is while using bluetooth in my car from a Pixel 3xl. Pre-update there was no issue.
1516,Cassidy Peoples,"March 31, 2020",1," The new layout is terrible, and if it doesn't change I will be using a different android podcast app in the future. It is such a mess, the feed is all over the place. Couldn't dislike it more."
1517,Dasaya Cates,"April 1, 2020",1," New UI SUCKS! Fix this mess, Google. I do NOT want to scroll several times to see all my podcasts. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! 😤"
1518,Haley Jagarwal,"April 2, 2020",5, I'm new to podcasts. But google podcast has made it very easy to find shows about information I'm into. Convient and useful. Great product.
1519,Phillip Andrews,"April 4, 2020",4," It works about 90% of the time, the other 10% it pauses out of nowhere or restarts the podcast. It works though which it all I want"
1520,Garry Barton,"April 4, 2020",1, Constant freezing after update. UI is also now pretty busy. If freezing issue isn't fixed soon will be switching to a new app.
1521,Indu Shekhar,"April 17, 2020",1, It just crashes... Sorry how can it be so hard to make a app like this... Specially for Google... It crashes when I try send the feedback...
1522,mohsin khan,"April 7, 2020",1, I loved this app but now completely destroyed by this new UI. What was simple and intuitive is now cluttered and unmanageable. Please revert to previous UI.
1523,Abel Wilson,"April 10, 2020",5, Having an app that is natively made by google feels so valuable. I love the smile size and I love the cue cards that come up when I see who the person being interviewed is
1524,Frank Guardado,"April 10, 2020",5," I listen everyday, I learn so much about issues so many news reports don't like to report on. Many news broadcast stations all they want is ratings and will broadcast the worst of news. These reporting cast talk about real life issues and point of views which people like to listen too."
1525,Matt Sheppard,"April 13, 2020",1, New layout sucks. Hard to read at a glance... Major issues with playback now too. Only plays for 3-5 minutes then audio cuts out.
1526,Martin Nooteboom,"April 15, 2020",1, The app keeps quiting while listening. You can the start over again. This started with the last update. The App is unusable now
1527,Mike Collins,"April 20, 2020",1, This app was just fine until the UI changed recently. Much harder to browse subscribed podcasts. Buffers a lot even with perfect service.
1528,علوي باعلوي,"April 23, 2020",5, It loved it .. because it is very useful to improve language for English learners.. I hope to fix the speed of downloading their files .. Thanks
1529,Daniel Ngo,"April 24, 2020",1, This app keeps cutting out and buffering my podcasts. It worked the first few weeks but now it is not functional.
1530,Delia P.,"April 28, 2020",4, Great selection for my interest. Very easy to use. Pause and restart for continuing later if interrupted.
1531,Charles Andrew Beel,"April 30, 2020",1," 4/30/20: Night mode! BUT STILL NO Widget! -_- 4/15/19: NO WIDGET OR NIGHT THEME? No breaks for bathroom or sleep until this is done. Also, needs a web interface and central place to review/rate Podcasts like iTunes has."
1532,Aaron Couch,"March 28, 2020",3," Was hoping for offline listening function on the new update (yes, I know I can download episodes). Having an offline option would ensure users don't accidentally use data."
1533,E Brown,"March 23, 2020",1," Not sure where my first review went, so I will repost. Can't dismiss notification after closing app. Seems to be a known issue and all my apps are up to date. Update still not fixed."
1534,kevin comer,"April 21, 2020",2," The new update made the app useless, the home screen won't fully load up, and the search tab takes forever to load."
1535,Chris Haas,"April 16, 2020",1, Unreliable. Too many disconnects and stops. I won't even go to how I had to Jerry rig things every time a podcast was interrupted.
1536,Jon Hillenbrand,"March 3, 2020",5," Works pretty perfectly. I know it's not as popular as Apple Podcasts, but it has all the same content and it's reliable and works perfectly with Android Auto."
1537,Anusha Surisetty,"March 12, 2020",5, It's a fresh change from reading articles on and on. It reduces my screen time and I can listen to the podcasts at my leisure. Love it.
1538,Victor Zenea,"March 25, 2020",3," 3/24/2020 Update: Bug fixes, no support for private feeds yet Well, this app makes a false claim ""listen to any podcast"". Thing is, it doesn't support private feed podcasts, like Sam Harris'."
1539,Nacho Fernández,"March 20, 2020",4," Please add queue functionality! It's the only thing I'm missing from the app. Clean interface, easy to use, it does not have all the podcasts that I follow, but I'm ok with that"
1540,Xi Yue,"April 9, 2020",5," Love the new interface! Took some time to get used to , but once you did, it's so much better than the simplified version before. A lot of great features too."
1541,Eric Riehle,"March 26, 2020",2, 2 days ago I would have given this five stars. This recent update has absolutely destroyed this app. Please give us an option to go back to the old look or I won't be using this app again.
1542,Dan Moore,"March 27, 2020",1, Not being able to see mutilple podcasts on screen at once is a real issue now with this update. Really can't understand why Google would think this has made the app better and not less usable.
1543,Aaron Peters,"April 1, 2020",5," Much easier than before to add any podcast you want, not just the ones that are listed with Google Music."
1544,William Harlow,"April 1, 2020",2, This app was good until the update. It has to buffer downloaded podcasts and has trouble downloading podcasts. The new layout is much more difficult that the old layout.
1545,Michael McCann,"April 1, 2020",1, New layout is not as easy to use and get around. It is significantly hard to find podcasts that you were previously listening to and had to stop.
1546,Marcelo Barbosa,"April 7, 2020",1," Terrible experience, all the time the app stop showing a pop up with ""something wrong..."" I can't listen a podcast without 2 ou 3 fails."
1547,D P,"April 6, 2020",1, The terrible user interface of this app just got worse. Downloads fail constantly. You have to manually download which is very annoying.
1548,Leo Mobile,"April 10, 2020",1, After the update it is much harder to listen to my podcasts because it will stop and indicate that it is buffering.
1549,Imtiaz Mahmud,"April 9, 2020",5, It's a great podcast. The sound quality is great. The design of the app is very easy to use I and nice to look at. So all together it is a great podcast app.
1550,Remko Claassen,"April 10, 2020",5," Cast option is the best, that's what a lot of similar apps are missing (or hiding behind a paywal)."
1551,Lith Ahmed,"April 8, 2020",1, It streams for few minutes then stops no matter how long you wait..its terrible although it has great episodes on it. So sorry..I wish they fix it
1552,Tracy Payne,"April 10, 2020",5," I really love Google Podcasts. It has become my #1 place for listening to news and things I'm interested in over pay-for-options like Audiobooks, Blinkist, or SiriusXM"
1553,Rohit Gupta,"April 14, 2020",1," Truely from the bottom of my heart, I hate the new design. The simplicity of orignal design is what compelled me to use google podcast instead of countless other awesome podcast apps."
1554,Benjamin Feijóo,"April 14, 2020",4, Easy to use. not a lot of setting options for personalization. Easy interface.
1555,Richard Whitfield,"April 19, 2020",3, It keeps stopping when I black out my screen when it didn't used to. I really like Google products and this is disappointing.
1556,Muthu Mani,"April 16, 2020",2, While listening to podcasts at speed of more than 1.1x it's not good.. it makes some noises very unpleasant.. This bug needs to be fixed..
1557,BHAVIN ARYA,"April 16, 2020",2," Podcast app is great but new updates made it terrible. Now, Interface is very clumsy and unpleasant. I like the old style. !"
1558,Vern Kuato,"April 24, 2020",1," Wortst UI/UX Ever! No more easy to use, everything become grid and sucks! No navigation bar! No more easy to reach playlist!"
1559,V,"April 27, 2020",4," I'm just curious to see this app grow. I know it's not popular as the apple podcast or the spotify's, but I find this app's interface as clean and the recommendations on this are really good!"
1560,Marnie Stepanchuk,"April 29, 2020",4," Absolutely love it, never any issues, but I really hate the look and layout of the content."
1561,Harshit Joshi,"April 1, 2020",4," All other apps are better than this. it does not have a sleep timer, an episode search bar etc. Edit: A sleep timer has been added. But please episode searching and a dark mode is a must. Edit 1: Okay a sleep timer is added. Please add and episode search."
1562,Adam,"April 21, 2020",1," The new app is terrible. Downloaded episodes have to buffer. You have to skip forward then skip backwards, it's ridiculous."
1563,Ketan Ramteke,"April 28, 2020",5," Please add dark theme. Dark Theme looks Sleek. Feature Suggestion: Please add search functionality in Podcast Channel Page. It will be very useful, Similar to the Castbox app. ♥️ This app."
1564,Henrique,"March 18, 2020",4, Could be better. Sometimes when you pause and resume the episode it doesn't start from where it was paused making it difficult to find the right time.
1565,Sung Hee Han,"April 5, 2020",1, I don't like latest update. The tile size of each podcast is so small and the UI is not as friendly as previous version.
1566,Alex Thorn,"March 30, 2020",4," I get a lot of numbers from Google Podcasts for my podcasts. It should be pushed harder by Google, because a lot of Android users don't even know it exist."
1567,Mohammed Fakhry,"March 7, 2020",2," I listened to many podcasts form different channels, but recently i noticed that the (green✔) next to the already played podcasts is not available anymore. What's wrong?"
1568,Hayden Esau,"March 6, 2020",1," The new version is teeeeerible. It used to be so easy to look at and navigate through, now it's clunky as.😥. Please change it back."
1569,Deja Hall,"March 9, 2020",2," This app is constantly stopping. I keep receiving the ""Unable to Play"" error and my podcasts will just stop playing in the middle. It's pretty weird."
1570,Jeremy Willman,"March 25, 2020",1, The updated UI is hot garbage. Why would you possibly want a single side scroll column of all your podcasts at the top to navigate through? I cannot believe someone thought this was an improvement.
1571,Joseph French,"March 25, 2020",5, Very good podcast app. Its got everything you need from a speed meter to a share button I you find an interesting podcast. I don't know if its the best podcast service but on its own it's very good.
1572,Lilly Tyre,"March 26, 2020",1, New update is awful. Can't put podcasts in order which makes this app useless to me. I listen to a lot of different podcasts and go in phases and this app used to serve my needs so well but this update makes it a waste of space.
1573,Jamie F,"March 26, 2020",1, I spent months organising my podcasts into an order to quickly access different types. The new update destroyed that and makes it impossible to quickly overview different podcasts. Unusable.
1574,Amy Keahi,"March 26, 2020",5," I have had a podcast collector for many years, but this one is easy to use and has many great features (sleep timer, and speed listening). I'm excited to use this new app!!"
1575,Darren Cashmore,"March 30, 2020",1," Was a great app with no issues however the new ""improved"" interface is horrible to use compared to the previous version. I'll be seeking a new podcasting app now."
1576,Sharyn Davis,"March 28, 2020",3, Loved the app before.. hate the new layout. The scroll at the top is too small and I cant find what I want easily. Please put it back how it was.
1577,Ryan Young,"March 28, 2020",1," What have you done, this app was easy to use and auto played the next episode. Now it stops after every episode. I want the old version back"
1578,Shahzomby Tupacalypse,"March 31, 2020",1, The new UI is terrible and having to queue episodes to listen w/out interruption is a horrible idea. It was the best podcast app available but the whole queue and interface change was a poor decision.
1579,Jimmy Opot,"April 2, 2020",1," The interface is poorly designed prior the previous one. Also, the navigation is harder, how can I delete the episodes I downloaded and listened to?"
1580,Vanessa Valencia,"April 1, 2020",5," Amazing app for podcasts. My favorite feature is the one that lets me speed up the voices and skip over silence, which allows me to finish podcast faster. Thank you Google"
1581,Joe C.,"April 3, 2020",5, This is the most efficient podcast app that I have downloaded. User-friendly layout without tons of crazy ads. Highly recommend!
1582,Diya Trivedi,"April 6, 2020",4," Love the user interface, but there are some podcasts which I didn't find here, but they were local so maybe it's alright"
1583,Matthew Lawrence,"April 4, 2020",5, I don't have a ton of experience with podcast apps but this is one I enjoy using the most. Very simple to use and easy to navigate.
1584,Dhruv Jain,"April 7, 2020",3," There is some problem with the theme option. Whenever I select the dark mode it switches to light mode automatically. Also, it still shows that dark mode is selected in the theme option"
1585,chris hays,"April 9, 2020",2, It was great until the last update. Now you can barely see the icons across the top. The response from Google was no help
1586,Jamie Lopez,"April 13, 2020",2," bring back the old style, the one where you can view the grid of podcasts. this one row of podcast takes longer to find podcast I'm looking for"
1587,billy anderson,"April 18, 2020",1," This app used to be great until the update. The apps are all in one line at the top now, I can't organise them how i like."
1588,Michelle,"April 19, 2020",1, It's insane. You cannot set a que. You download and it buffers I've never heard of such a thing. It's supposed to be there so you don't have that issue. I hate this app
1589,Vivian Cohan,"April 24, 2020",5, When I can't sit and watch my murder shows I can work and listen. Works great I've not had any problems.
1590,Zachariah Manard,"April 30, 2020",5, Pretty decent. Better than other podcast apps out there. Easy to use and has a good deletion system with used and old podcasts.
1591,Tadas Pakalnis,"April 15, 2020",1," basic basic basic, missing a ton of features. After latest update all of my podcast history (downloads, queues, etc) has disappeared..."
1592,Aaron Cocker,"April 21, 2020",5," Great to see the recent updates with queuing and auto download, this makes this app a lot better and more useable on commutes."
1593,Kevin Davis,"April 19, 2020",3, The app was sparse but adequate. Recent updates improve functionality. App is still slow to surface new and recent podcasts.
1594,Charles Meda,"April 13, 2020",5," Easy to use, no ads on the app. Great! Edit: after a year keeps getting better"
1595,Zack Kirby,"March 25, 2020",1," This app used to be great, and they just butchered the home screen. Please, why change something not broken? There's no friendly user interface now. Help!"
1596,Samuel Thompson,"April 14, 2020",5, Decent podcasts app. The new version fixes a bug where the notification would never go away.
1597,Robert Atkinson,"April 20, 2020",3," Updated is an improvement. Still needs better implementation of the playlist feature, ability to download to SD card."
1598,Albert Jones,"April 3, 2020",1, Love it!!! Before the new layout. now other issues like my sound cuts out 3min in to whatever podcast I'm listening too..🤬
1599,Paul Shook,"March 29, 2020",1, Changing from a 4 star review to a 1 start after last update. The new interface is extremely difficult to use and it keeps crashing.
1600,Anthony Morra,"February 27, 2020",5," I love the simplicity, especially when I'm using it in my car on Android Mobile. I don't have to go through all the sub menus like I do for Spotify."
1601,Joshua Anderson,"March 13, 2020",5," Reliable and has lots of podcasts. Even the less popular ones are usually available. Pretty stable app, and the desktop version is getting better."
1602,Margie Okin,"March 14, 2020",5," Works perfectly! It's just like the apple version, and having switched from an iPhone to an Android, I appreciate the familiarity."
1603,Luka Vasic Kelly,"March 21, 2020",5, It works very well and nothing is complicated. It's easy to find the podcasts you're interested in. Would recommend to anyone.
1604,George Owino,"March 23, 2020",2," Can't Remove From Notification Bar That's the most annoying thing about the app. I love everything else, but he fact that I can't swipe away the icon from the notification bar I'm not listening to anything is irritating beyond measure"
1605,Terminal Grav,"March 25, 2020",3, Disappointed with UI change. Why fix what's not broken? I stopped using Apple's podcast app for this reason. It's still a good app but I'd like it if I could keep the interface I had become used to.
1606,John K,"March 26, 2020",1," Now you have made it worse. Where are the in progress podcasts for android auto? Now I have lost my position, I dont listen the very latest podcast. All I needed was ""in progress"" to be at the top of the list in AA, I don't think there is a software engineering team at google, just programmers."
1607,Ifaré Datagni,"March 27, 2020",1," The new update is awful, the episodes don't play continuously, my shows & episodes are all scattered on the home page like an iphone home page 😡 . Whoever came up with this layup need to stop smoking whatever they're on"
1608,Reena,"March 27, 2020",1, It was great until the most recent update took away all the organization and replaced it with chaos. I just want the tab of all my in-progress episodes back.
1609,"George Denise, Jr.","March 31, 2020",1, It always freezes. Even when I download the podcast and don't stream it still freezes. Forget it. I'm moving on to another app.
1610,Matt Bradley,"March 31, 2020",1," The new layout is garbage. Also, all of a sudden downloaded episodes get stuck ""buffering."" This never happened until this update."
1611,Alonzo Aguilar-Vazquez,"April 1, 2020",1, Since the new update certain episodes/channels don't play at all while the ones that do t get stuck in an endless buffering state having to manually move the time to get it working again
1612,Joshua Sherden,"April 1, 2020",5, I love it! So glad that Google has podcasts. Keep adding more stations to make it even better.
1613,alberto lugato,"April 7, 2020",1, The new interface is SO BAD. I have to scroll a lot to find a specific podcast. It's messy and unpleasant. Give me back the old one.
1614,Arman Soltani,"April 18, 2020",1, Used to be my favourite app. Doesn't update my podcasts on some channels. Don't even have access to the previous ones.
1615,Max McCloud,"April 6, 2020",5, The best I've seen over the past 4 yrs that I've been attached to podcasts! Google quality I've learned to expect!(
1616,Jesse Johnson,"April 9, 2020",2," My subscriptions can't load, and updating the Google App didn't help. Have to dig through the subscriptions tab to find anything."
1617,Marcus Vinícius,"April 9, 2020",2," Hated the new update, all my downloaded podcasts disappeared. I also hated the apparent limitation to 300 podcasts, a lot of older podcasts also disappeared"
1618,Zach Fike,"April 15, 2020",1, They updated the app and completely broke it. Whenever I listen to a podcast it constantly buffers every 2 mins even with super fast wifi.
1619,Carly Elias,"April 17, 2020",3, The new update has made this app much less user friendly. I preferred seeing my subscriptions the way it used to be. Please put it back!
1620,Jakub Kriš,"April 20, 2020",1," This update ruined the app. Bad UI, downloaded episodes stuck after 5 minutes or so. Deleting them and streaming over data won't help."
1621,Richard Thwaites,"April 24, 2020",1," Keeps crashing. Limited settings, unable to chnage download or playback order. All in all a VERY poor product from Google."
1622,Phillip Arriola,"April 28, 2020",5, Love how you can download segments and listen to them even if you dont have phone service. Very easy to use great app
1623,Mike Pelzel Poklemba,"April 29, 2020",5," Works great, love that I'm able to share my podcasts which other apps are not capable of."
1624,Peter Trimboli,"April 12, 2020",1, With the new update if you listen to an old episode it doesn't auto play the next episode which is frustrating especially when you're driving
1625,Tony Morris,"April 19, 2020",4," Great app for podcasts, but the interface became a bit more cumbersome a week or so ago."
1626,Joe,"April 18, 2020",3, Almost perfect except it often doesn't save where I'm up to on a podcast. Such a basic requirement for a podcast app
1627,Sergey Simakov,"April 16, 2020",4, It would be nicer if an episode you haven't finished yet wouldn't vanish from a playlist when you start listening to a new one
1628,Stephen Boger,"March 25, 2020",5, UPDATE: Google updated features to fix all of the areas I previously had frustration with...and it's now a rock solid fantastic podcast app! Thanks for the update!!!
1629,Brad Mumphrey,"April 2, 2020",2, New update is not good and is not user friendly at all. Not sure why it was changed. The interface is not user friendly in fact it's the complete opposite
1630,Katie Jensen,"March 4, 2020",5, Being of a older generation it can be difficult to navigate my phone sometimes. I love listening to podcasts and pretty much tried every app but this one far as surpasses the competition- highly recommend
1631,m grimreaper,"March 8, 2020",4," Really good app but nothing's perfect. The app just seems raw, its a really great start but there's a lot to be done with the app."
1632,Alicia Porter,"March 5, 2020",3, Needs a playlist feature. I don't always want to auto play the next episode of the same podcast. I'd like to make a custom list for variety.
1633,Kyrah Rea,"March 9, 2020",5," I love this app, it's a great way to be able to listen to all podcasts. You can even download some to listen offline which is perfect. ❤️"
1634,Genessa L. Bivins,"March 9, 2020",5, Love this app. I love that I can download podcasts and listen offline. Everything updates normally and the quality is always good.
1635,David Apeji,"March 11, 2020",2," Shameful level of unreliability. What can the excuse possibly be?? An app created but Google running in an operating system created by Google crashes so frequently, it is infuriating. Get your act together."
1636,Stacey West,"March 12, 2020",4, I like that I can download a podcast and listen on my way to work. Still working on navigating what's available so I can't speak to the selections yet
1637,Jessica Cha,"March 19, 2020",2, While i really like its clean layout i really cant stand tbe annoyance of not being able to save episodes. Ive already deleted and reinstalles the app but it's no use. Really annoying.
1638,Srinivas Talada,"March 25, 2020",3," The interface is nice and good Has almost all podcasts But i think it should not rely on Google app to work. Whenever, i close the google app from background the podcast stops playing which is literally annoying 😡😡"
1639,Douglas Castano,"March 25, 2020",1," It was great until today. Now it sucks. Layout sucks, more difficult. Also having problems connecting to my headphones that I didn't have before"
1640,Erica Conrad,"March 25, 2020",1, This new interface is awful. It's so hard to navigate and I can no longer cast to my Google Home. I understand the desire to switch things up but this is a real downgrade.
1641,Christopher Santos,"March 27, 2020",1, Can no longer auto play from single source in order using updated app. I don't want to spend half my morning every morning building out the playlist that was already there in previous version.
1642,Jethro Lorenzo Garcia Lising,"March 28, 2020",4," Beautiful interface. Simple and clean. A few issues. On galaxy s10e, Android 10, when a notification sound chimes in, the Podcasts will stop until the notification sound ceases. Otherwise, its nice!"
1643,Shubham Shivta,"March 29, 2020",1, Persistent notification does not go away even if I kill the app. I thought this would be fixed in an update but I've been having this issue for as long as I can remember.
1644,John Belushi,"March 30, 2020",4, I had complaints about the recent redesign and all the problems it created... They seem to have resolved a lot of that though. Thanks!
1645,Gregory Stroud,"March 27, 2020",1, I hate the new home page.. Put it back like it was. I listen to podcasts while I drive and the new home screen icons are so small it takes to much time to look at them to be safe.
1646,Ranjith V,"April 1, 2020",1," The new layout is not helpful. Downloaded episodes stop playing and the player shows ""Buffering"" - what is the point of downloading when there is going to be buffering ?"
1647,Barry Connolly,"April 2, 2020",1," Used to love this app, but the new landing page layout is absolutely terrible and difficult to navigate."
1648,Justin LaRosa,"April 6, 2020",1," Was good for awhile, but now constantly says ""buffering"" in the middle of a podcast, even when downloaded first"
1649,Mona Zadeh,"April 4, 2020",2," It was good before but some how it changed,you can not see your home with podcasts it shows by episodes,it is so confusing now"
1650,La flor Noah,"April 3, 2020",5, I like this app because it has a huge amount of different kinds of podcasts which help me to learn English and Spanish:)
1651,David S. Medlock,"April 7, 2020",3," I had this at 5 Stars and NOW I have to give it ONE Star. All these damn ""Updates"" are making it WORSE. Go back a couple months and leave it alone."
1652,T,"April 8, 2020",5, This is great. Love that I can change the speed and save podcasts to listen to later.
1653,Ken Boggs,"April 9, 2020",1," Stops randomly. Shows downloading, but podcast stored on device. Many reports of same problem for over a year."
1654,Simon Orchard,"April 12, 2020",1, The new user interface is terrible... Why change from something that was so perfect to this confusing mess??? Very disappointed
1655,Tom Peterson,"April 15, 2020",1, Used to be my favourite podcast app but since the March update I consider it unusable clunky and hard to use. Sorry but sometimes things are best left alone.
1656,ARUP KUMAR MOHAPATRA,"April 16, 2020",4, It's good way to improve English knowledge. We can listen it any time we want like music. It also hepl in building personality.
1657,Craig Burkhart,"April 18, 2020",1," I hate the new interface. It's far more unfriendly for the user, compared to the previous interface. Hate the new!"
1658,James Nixon Steel,"April 17, 2020",1, I love this app but recently it has paused the podcast randomly when listening. I think it reduces the volume on my phone too
1659,Randy Tackie,"April 21, 2020",4, Great App but can you pls add the play/pause button in the notification. It used to be there but has been taken out. No idea why.
1660,Naveen Singh,"April 21, 2020",5," It has everything that a real podcast app should have, and one thing that fascinates me most is its application size viz. 678 kb only."
1661,Arush Sharma,"April 23, 2020",1, Podcasts stop and hang in between. I need to pause and move +30 sec to play again. This problem arises even if podacast is downloaded
1662,Michael Black,"April 24, 2020",1, The name of the App should be something went wrong. This is the error you will constantly see while using this application.
1663,A Google user,"April 5, 2020",1, great podcast app* format changed so I'll be moving on as it's a fix that is so rediculous I wouldn't even bother trying to navigate as it's no longer user friendly
1664,A Google user,"March 31, 2020",1, You ruined the app! I liked the old design way better. Add the queue function to the old design and it would be perfect. Looking for a new podcast app now!
1665,Abraham Thomas,"March 16, 2020",5, It's great for someome like me who loves to listen to podcasts. Just be warned that you may not find some podcasts because the haven't signed up with Google Podcasts.
1666,Brandy Collins,"March 26, 2020",2, Newest update makes it difficult to view and navigate through podcasts. Design is for newest in front which makes scrolling for other podcasts difficult and time consuming.
1667,Benjamin Lancaster,"April 9, 2020",5, They made great changes to the application all the things I really wanted! Automatic downloads and playlist etc. Much better! Darkmode next?
1668,Lara L,"April 4, 2020",5, There's just one thing I would add... please add a swipe or icon feature to delete episodes you aren't interested in listening to.
1669,Tanika Allen,"April 3, 2020",3," I would 5-star the app if all the podcasts would play straight through, but some of them buffer every 5 minutes and that is super annoying."
1670,Dan Renegade,"April 7, 2020",1, Update new review This new update killed the app for me what was very simpled and worked flawlessly now can play for 2 minutes before crashing gonna try something different and delete this.
1671,Steve,"March 10, 2020",5," It has tons of up to date apps! I am a real person that has used plenty of other podcast apps, but I'm loving this one. Try it out for real."
1672,Matthew Wietzema,"March 13, 2020",5, Good place for Audiobooks & Podcasts. Good cheap source of Entertainment if money is tight. If you catch my meaning. Excellent Smart Application. Thank You Google Love it.
1673,Yasir Din,"March 15, 2020",5," Excellent search function. Simple, clean, and intuitive (things which are in *very* short supply when it comes to android podcast apps)."
1674,Matthew Moellmann,"April 30, 2020",2, What happened to this app. I woke up this morning and all my subscriptions are gone and I can't sign in to my account. Anyone else having issues?
1675,Jane Bartle,"March 14, 2020",4, Infinitely more user friendly than the CBC apps I have been using. Search function is pretty good. And Favourites works very well. Thanks.
1676,Felicity Pobje,"March 19, 2020",3," It has been working well but recently started to crash after connecting to the cast feature, could you please look into this and try to fix it"
1677,Stephen James Fox,"March 18, 2020",5," ~ This application is very nifty; I have some esoteric interests ( Opera, et cetera )and this application is terrific. ~Alk the best. Stephen James Fox Deerfield Beach and Gainesville, Florida USA et al."
1678,Leigh Alderton,"March 19, 2020",5," Works well, no complaints, plays every podcast I want to listen to without buffering or any other problems. Have found every podcast I want in the catalogue."
1679,Erik Lopez,"March 27, 2020",5, Love this app for all my podcast needs. But honestly I'm not that into the newest update. Kind of wish the last version was available. It seemed to keep everything organized better.
1680,Andrew Butterfield,"March 27, 2020",1, Previous app layout was intuitive and easy to view all podcasts. New app layout is not intuitive and is difficult to see all of the podcasts you've subscribed to.
1681,Ginny Ilive,"March 27, 2020",1, Been enjoying this app till today the whole setup changed. Not happy in fact I am totally lost trying to find my favourite podcasts which appear in alphabetical order. My personal choice gone.
1682,Brian Duval,"March 30, 2020",1," New layout is horrible! Used to be able to see all my podcasts on one page. Now I have to scroll & search. Whoever created the ""new"" design, needs a blanket party"
1683,daniel wycoff,"March 30, 2020",1," My go to podcast app but new Layout is terrible. No way to organize /find podcasts. Seriously, why fix it if it's not broke. Back to Stitcher I guess, really disappointed"
1684,Thomas Beresford,"April 1, 2020",2," Feels more stable in recent releases but the new design layout is not as compact as before, making it less intuitively easy to navigate or see more podcasts at once."
1685,Tyler Rudy,"April 2, 2020",1, Podcast keeps pausing every 5min and won't resume without skipping forward. Very annoying 😡 I'm switching to something else till this is fixed.
1686,Nicole Cross,"April 2, 2020",3, The new update layout sucks. I don't know whats new or in progress anymore. Please change it back or give us the option to customize the layout.
1687,Randy Wong,"April 7, 2020",5," Very informative, easy to download for offline access. Highly recommended."
1688,Kevin Calmiano,"April 16, 2020",4, I'm enjoying using this app and especially at I can listen between my phone when I'm out and pickup the podcast on my Google Home when I'm home.
1689,Abel Rwego,"April 23, 2020",5, Best app in a while... no disturbances and us quite straight forward. I also like the offline option.
1690,Nick Borcic,"April 26, 2020",5," Smooth UI, well laid out. Quality content, has everything I like to listen to."
1691,La Donna Pizzifred,"April 21, 2020",1," The new format is horrible, it's very hard to find anything and not user friendly at all please change it back"
1692,Michael Terry,"April 26, 2020",4," Improving. Any chance of wear is offline capability. Would be great to go for a run, listen and position synced"
1693,Keegan Schofield,"May 1, 2020",1, Old layout was a lot better. Would like the ability to import audio files as well.
1694,RAKHIL .P,"March 22, 2020",5, STOP USING THE APP becouse when you listen something the mini player on the botification bar never get removed. untill you turn off the audio player permission of the google app in settings. fix the issue.
1695,Zach Lantz,"April 1, 2020",1, The new UI is to much to handle very clunky compared to previous look wish they would have a way to go back! 4 days later now my entire library was deleted mid podcast...... Guess I am going to a new podcast app 😔
1696,Alicia Pratt,"March 8, 2020",3, Huge fan of podcasts and the idea of your app however for some reason i cant update it or get any help from ur listed assistance details. The upgrades ive seen on others phones is a massive improvement)
1697,Yoseph yeah yeah Yates,"March 12, 2020",4, This is great! New to podcasts (I know I am late) but since my phone can't download music or save photos(Nokia 7.2) this is the next best thing for at work!
1698,Eli Linares,"March 13, 2020",5," One of the best, absolutely love the interface. I would love for an option to download Podcast for offline listening."
1699,karaoui laredj,"March 14, 2020",5," It's amazing so clean no adds and totally free, but it can be better if you add dark mode. But generally it's the best podcast app I ever used."
1700,albert munoz,"March 18, 2020",5, The app is awesome! The audio is clear and crisp with no delays. Enjoy listening to my favorite Podcasts.
1701,Justin Schreurs,"March 22, 2020",1," No auto download function... There are many other options to choose from. Until Google provides this basic function, it is a good idea to pass on this app."
1702,Renee Putman,"March 24, 2020",5," I enjoy the stories of Matt and Karen's travels to the National Parks!!! I also enjoy the individual story of the National Park Inn,s. I look forward to the next podcast for their next interesting travels!!"
1703,Kendrick Ballard,"March 25, 2020",1," works perfectly when it works but recently it hasn't been playing sound no matter what method of listening I used. BT headphones , wired or even the phone speaker"
1704,Krista Park,"March 25, 2020",2," Worst update ever. I can't scroll through my available podcasts. If I don't listen the first time, it is hard to find. This is an anti-listening app."
1705,Matthew Rhodes,"March 27, 2020",1, I really hate the new layout. Please change back to the old one or give me the option to do so. I subscribe to a LOT of podcasts and this view makes it much harder to manage all of them.
1706,Jon Pintea,"March 28, 2020",1, I hate the new format. It takes forever to find if my shows have new releases just by scanning. Change it back.
1707,Eli Jennings,"March 28, 2020",1," Absolutely garbage app. Constantly looses connection to Google Home, crashes, stops playing podcasts.. it literally exists for one reason and it sucks at it. Stay away and find a better podcast app."
1708,Luis Carreno,"March 29, 2020",2," This app used to autoplay my podcasts through and now it just stops and I have to stop what I'm doing and open up my phone to play the next episode in the series I am on, very inconvenient"
1709,Peter,"March 31, 2020",1, New layout is horrible. It doesn't even play the next podcast on a channel's list. I wish there was a way to go back to the old layout and way it plays.
1710,Raven Kirk,"April 1, 2020",5, I enjoy every podcast I add. It helps me start my day on a good note. As far as functionality the app works great!
1711,Trent Bartlem,"April 1, 2020",4, Still usability issues especially with queues but it at least is getting close to feature parity with competitors (auto downloads etc)
1712,Matt Huber,"April 2, 2020",2," At times, audio cuts off. This didn't happen prior to the latest update."
1713,Agatha Christie,"April 5, 2020",4, Great app! It's functional and helpful. I'm glad I can download what I want to listen to either for that moment or later.
1714,Austin Howell,"April 10, 2020",1," Seems to censor content. Certain podcasts play flawlessly, others just don't. The bias is clear."
1715,Khushi Vajpeyi,"April 10, 2020",5," I love the app! It has loads of podcasts and you can download them, which is really convenient. 💯"
1716,Jim Miele,"April 11, 2020",5, Love the format of the platform and the selection is excellent for on-demand news consumers like me.
1717,Patrick Sweeney,"April 22, 2020",1, I am looking for a different podcast steamer after the last user interface overhaul. It is now very user unfriendly.
1718,Nim Warin,"March 30, 2020",3, Not a fan of this new UI. In order to find a podcast/episode I have to do more scrolling than previous version. And it doesn't auto play next episode anymore?
1719,Elizabeth Bradford,"April 27, 2020",3," This app used to be great but with one update, it wiped out everything that I saved. My entire download list."
1720,Michael Sylvester,"April 7, 2020",3," App used to be good, but now it pauses every 4 or so minutes. Not sure what happen??"
1721,Simbu Moorthy,"March 5, 2020",4, Full of bugs. Never downloads and stuck at 0% when download button is pressed. App crashes randomly. Please take it off the store if you're not maintaining it
1722,Matt H,"April 13, 2020",1, Used to like this but I hate the new interface with my podcasts along the top. I'm going to try pocketcasts.
1723,Stanzi McWang,"April 5, 2020",2, Really dislike the new layout. The previous layout is cleaner and easier to navigate.
1724,Colin Heslin,"April 1, 2020",2, Great to have access to all the podcasts. New layout is diabolical though: very hard to see what's in progress.
1725,Tyler Durden,"April 17, 2020",2, This was a very good app for podcast untill they changed the user interface. Its just a mess now i cant even use it anymore.
1726,Pavaman Bhat,"April 10, 2020",1," Keeps stoping every 2 minutes, even on downloaded episodes. Used to be great, now not so much."
1727,Chris Morris,"March 4, 2020",3," I would give it five stars except it doesn't support podcast behind pay walls, which I expect will become an increasingly common thing."
1728,Robert Thomson,"March 6, 2020",5," Awesome. All the podcasts you could ever want are here. Some are just previews or condensed versions, but the variety is terrific."
1729,Splashy Splish,"March 13, 2020",3, Searching for new podcasts is a pain. You have to know what podcast you are looking for. You cant search based on subject matter.
1730,Joel Greenbogêy,"March 15, 2020",1," No batch download, frequently fails to complete download without auto retrying. No ability to differentiate between data & WiFi. Really really useless and shockingly under thought."
1731,Maurice Ware,"March 16, 2020",5," The app has a simple, user-friendly interface, and makes accessing podcast simpler than the Google Play Music app."
1732,Sean Oleson,"March 17, 2020",4," Better and more expansive library than the Google Play Music app. Sleek, fast and minimalist. Could use more search features, like filters."
1733,Jesus Guzman,"March 24, 2020",5," Easy to use. I also enjoy that when you pause the podcast, the app does back a little to keep you engaged."
1734,Timothy Baker,"March 26, 2020",1," Was a totaly fine application, update created a bloated unusable IU now fundemently garbage. Edit: rather than pay some idiot to forward a links, or build a bot, to reviewers or as to why they broke a working UI maybe hire a good UI designer hmmmmm."
1735,Austin Chestnut,"March 26, 2020",3, I loved the old version. Simple. Stable. Clean. The latest update makes navigating much harder. Put it back the way it was.
1736,CONCRETE,"March 29, 2020",3, 🤦🏾‍♂️ The new update. OMG... WHY?! I was excited until I realized I couldn't find my favorites and had to scroll through many to find them. Can I get the grid view back please? Or just a better way to navigate. Thanks
1737,ragged,"March 28, 2020",1, can we go back? the new player needs a classic mode. its hard to search for the podcast you want when its a just a one item colum of your podcasts. its just super busy looking to me. can we please go back?
1738,Olivia Amadi,"April 3, 2020",5," Great, even better now that you can make a queue But wish it would sync properly between my phone and asking Home speaker to continue a podcasts."
1739,graham spence,"March 27, 2020",1, The new layout since the update is terrible. The grid format was much better. Gonna have to download a different app that has a better setup.
1740,Corbin Corbin,"March 30, 2020",1," What happened? Podcasts, which worked fine before the update, seem to cut out after a few minutes and stay stuck on buffering."
1741,camcam99ish,"March 28, 2020",1, Failure of an app. Just Google it and listen. The app does f all except forgot everything and doesn't allow auto download of specific apps. If you want to have regular episodes delete this app
1742,Lindsay Scotland,"April 1, 2020",2, Terrible. It can't even find recent episodes of one of the BBCs most listened to podcasts (In Our Time). It only shows episodes from 2019.
1743,JOL,"April 3, 2020",1, You must know by now that the updates are a disaster. Cannot return to unfinished podcasts via Android Auto as you cannot find them. A useless app now.
1744,Varun Madhuraj,"April 3, 2020",5," Great app, and dark mode just made it better. Only issue I have is that it does not have widgets."
1745,Prashan Samarathunge,"April 3, 2020",4, Google Podcast is a very good podcast platform.❤️🖤💯 It would be more useful if there is a way to view a podcast file size before download.
1746,Vajresh Patkar,"April 5, 2020",4, Very nice app for listening podcast. Please add a time tracker that records how much have you been listening.
1747,Keith Dickens,"April 7, 2020",5, It works. It really isn't anything special. But it's very minimalistic and works exactly how you think it would so it's worth five stars.
1748,Rob Moon Jr,"April 9, 2020",1, The new update sucks! UI is horrible. Way harder to find the show I want to listen to. And how have they not added the option the review podcasts yet?
1749,First Bald Eagle,"April 12, 2020",4," This is definitely one of the easier, if not easiest, podcast apps. I tried stitcher but it was wired to maneuver. Same goes with Apple podcast"
1750,Michael Arnold,"April 13, 2020",1, Podcasts constantly stop to buffer despite being downloaded to my phone. The one job this app has is to play podcasts and it can't.
1751,Praphan Phadungkiatskun,"April 17, 2020",5, The sound is still on when I intentionally switch off the screen. Perfect!
1752,Christian Eaves,"April 20, 2020",5, Simple to use. I can cast to my speakers at home or just through bluetooth in my car.
1753,Stig Førsund,"April 23, 2020",2," It used to be very good! But after they re-did the layout and setup of the app, it is utter garbage! Very disappointed"
1754,ian jolovich,"April 24, 2020",2," The new layout is pretty terrible for cluttering up your ""listen next"" screen but the app will let you listed to podcasts."
1755,rajesh fernandes,"April 29, 2020",5," Simple, clean interface, yet with useful features. Light app."
1756,A Google user,"April 1, 2020",5," There is so much to learn, although I think a setting that allows the user save podcasts to external storage should be added."
1757,Adrian Valderama,"April 18, 2020",5," Why can't I remove the notification player? And when I instruct Google Home to continue playing, it has issues with syncing the last played position."
1758,Ben Gumbrell,"April 2, 2020",1," Dont mind the new layout, the app crashes after about 15 mins of a podcast, says its buffering even though ive downloaded it??? Was brilliant"
1759,Craig Targosz,"March 25, 2020",4," Simple and fast UI. With the additions of Dark mode, auto-downloading of new episodes, new episode notifications, and a queue all that's really missing is support for Custom RSS Feeds."

1761,Hillary McElhaney,"March 5, 2020",5, Easy to use. Love this simple podcast app. You can download podcasts and listen to them when you're off WiFi!
1762,Ron Mathew,"March 8, 2020",5, Absolutely loving it! Not sure if I'm missing something but wish there was a better way of finding podcasts based on tut type and genre...
1763,Hrishikesh Bawa,"March 11, 2020",5, Overall ui and experience is great. Easy to surf and download. Only request would be to have a desktop application companion to download/listen on laptop as well
1764,Candy Pants,"March 21, 2020",5, A great selection of content and so far no crashes. Easy to navigate as well. Definitely recommend.
1765,Manjot Singh,"March 22, 2020",3," Can't explore the unknowns, Plus it only shows you the similar kinds of Podcasts. Recommendations section is not that great. Could be better!"
1766,Kali Dale,"March 20, 2020",5," Easy to navigate, new episodes from shows I follow are on the front page. All the shows I listen to are on here including Conan O'Brien needs a friend, The Daily, and Wait Wait Don't Tell Me."
1767,Shekhar K,"March 19, 2020",3, It is very helpful and friendly to learn english and very meaningful to utilise my time. Thanks to Google for making these amazing handy apps. I'm very blessed to have the download option. 👍
1768,Justin Samlal,"March 25, 2020",1," I used this app nearly every day since launch, but I can't handle the visual redesign. Its cluttered, messy, and actually gave me a headache to look at."
1769,Raphael Padua,"March 26, 2020",2, the new layout sucks. The fact that you only have one strip on the top to view all of your podcasts is inefficient. Please fix this
1770,Peter Su,"March 26, 2020",1, The new interface for Android is terrible. I cant rearange the icon for my favorite podcasts channels. My least favorite podcasts shows up in the front because they have a new episode.
1771,Griffin Haarbauer,"March 28, 2020",2," The new screen format isn't helpful. I can't see enough episodes at a time, and I don't like that it shows more episodes than it used to."
1772,Denice Turpin,"March 28, 2020",1, I liked it until the recent update. Now I just have a long list of podcasts and not just the new releases. The organization is gone.
1773,Alex Burdz,"March 29, 2020",2, This app went from awesome to terrible. The new interface is not good. I used to be able to see all my podcasts at a glance and now it's just a mess.
1774,Aislinn Shyne,"March 30, 2020",1, New update makes it really hard for those who follow lots of podcasts. Takes forever to sort through the tiny row one at a time. Terrible new layout
1775,Ray Hilton,"March 30, 2020",3," I love the layout and UI, but the podcasts keep dropping (or stopping) randomly no matter what connection I have (Wi-Fi or mobile)."
1776,amanda saarela,"April 4, 2020",1, This was my go-to podcast app until this last update. I don't think you could make a worse user interface if you were deliberate about it. Give an option to revert back.
1777,Emily Pinkston,"April 3, 2020",1, The new interface is AWFUL! Its so hard to look through the shows. Please change it back....
1778,Melanija,"April 6, 2020",1, Used to be 5 star. Now it cuts off after a few minutes and just sits buffering.
1779,Marko M,"April 16, 2020",5," Great interface, easy to search and no advertisements. What more can you ask for?"
1780,Walid Ark,"April 17, 2020",1, After the new UI update I ve lost all my subscriptions! Also the layout is terrible... The UI/UX designers should be fired.
1781,Danny O,"April 28, 2020",5, Intuitive user interface. Love the clean and simple appearance.
1782,Sourav Panda,"April 28, 2020",1, The UI is terrible . Looks congested because of a lot of text on the home screen .
1783,Borite Pak,"April 21, 2020",5, Finally google has a response to apple's podcast and this is amazing. I cant belive how they didnt advertise or make it a big deal!! Love it and would recommend to everyone!!!
1784,Eric Sibbald,"April 30, 2020",5, Great and simple to use. Has every podcast I've looked for so send comprehensive as well.
1785,Stanley jean-baptiste,"April 1, 2020",2," love this app, great assortment of podcast! UPDATED 4/1 New design is pretty bad, removing the grid view leaves the homepage looking messy without a solid overview of my subscribed podcast"
1786,Shanna Resler,"April 17, 2020",1, WHYYYY was the interface changed!? It's horrible now! Please change it back. I'm going to have to switch to another service if this isn't changed. I'm so sad
1787,Nick Pietrefase,"April 2, 2020",1, The politically right leaning podcasts I try to download either do not properly download or refuse to play. I have no issues with my politically left leaning podcasts.
1788,ben snowden,"March 31, 2020",2, Finally decent after the last update. Still needs a WiFi/download only option and podcasts should not be removed from the queue when you start playing them.
1789,Edmond Marrows,"March 25, 2020",1," What a terrible update. Terrible interface, why change from the old tile display. If you love endless scrolling and wasting time, this is a great update."
1790,conrad featherstone,"March 10, 2020",4," Very easy to use. Works with voice commands in my car, so my podcasts are always just a ""Hey Google"" away."
1791,James Torrey,"March 9, 2020",2," Decent and well-built but needs a few things, they need to add a no downloads over cellular feature and automatic downloads for selected podcasts."
1792,Punlop Yeurnyao,"March 9, 2020",2," Easy to use but sometime lost the sound. Check on screen see ""unable to Play"". I no idea what wrong but it made me upset."
1793,Denis O. Ortiz,"March 10, 2020",5, 99% of the time I find the podcast I'm looking for. It's a very convenient app to have to get access to podcasts!
1794,John Tarrant,"March 11, 2020",2, It was a good app but now just keeps buffering and won't play. This happens on Wi-Fi and mobile data.
1795,Samson Onuegbu,"March 16, 2020",4," I love Google podcast! However, the subscribe button does not work for me. I don't know if it is a general issue or just my phone."
1796,Deepak Mukund,"March 23, 2020",3," Everything is great except, you can't clear the audio player from your notification bar after you've completed listening to a podcast."
1797,Jaime Haley,"March 17, 2020",5, No complaints. It just works and it has a clean easy to use interface. I've tried other platforms and they are just too busy trying to reinvent the UI experience.
1798,Julian Thomas,"March 21, 2020",5, Great podcast app. I love how it keeps track of podcasts I've listened to and where I left off on each one.
1799,Astrid mercada,"March 23, 2020",5," Really easy to look, subscribe and listen to podcasts. I love the feature that automatically deletes the podcasts you've listed to."
1800,ibrahim Mohamed,"March 24, 2020",4," even with strong internet connection it's kinda slow when you play an ep or something unlike other apps, i love the overall, but that's my only issue"
1801,Ben Shaw,"March 26, 2020",5," I love this app. I've tried Stitcher and Spotify for podcasts, but the Google Podcasts app really is much better. You can find something about almost everything and keep your podcasts very organized."
1802,Adnan Ahmad,"March 28, 2020",5, Better than radio because you can hear what you want. Informative and it helps reduce the screen time.
1803,Adam Erdreich,"March 27, 2020",5," New version (march 2020) has many features we were waiting for: Auto Download (with toggle per show), a Play Queue, and notifications on new episodes. Now it's perfect."
1804,Micah Hirschler,"March 27, 2020",4," I don't mind the new design, and I love that i can make a queue. My only problem is that I can't change the order that my subscription show up in."
1805,Matt Ford,"March 27, 2020",1," I hate the new interface, i rearranged my podcasts and I spend a lot more time scrolling. Also it doesn't seem to play the next episodes automatically anymore"
1806,lethargicj,"March 29, 2020",1, The new design of the app is truly ugly and hard to use. How anybody at Google thought this was an improvement is mind boggling. Will be finding a new app to use from now on.
1807,Jerad Kochmann,"March 27, 2020",2, They changed the layout to make it more difficult to pick what pod cast to listen to. Bring back the grid view!
1808,Keith T,"March 28, 2020",1," The new version is an eyesore... I cant believe you took out the clean version nd put this cluttered one,, i wish i knew how to go back to the old version and never update again..."
1809,Craig Bishop,"March 29, 2020",2," Got worse recently. Keeps stopping in the middle of playing, even for downloaded podcasts which is supremely annoying when you're driving and can't adjust it."
1810,b m,"March 31, 2020",2, this was my favorite podcast app but...twice this month it has deleted all of my subscriptions! all of my podcast I love gone twice! idk if I should go and resub all of them again or just wait and see if it gets worked out.
1811,Gary Bracken,"March 30, 2020",2, Used to be great but the latest update has ruined the front page. Please give the option to have the old grid layout back.
1812,Hermes Trismicristo,"March 30, 2020",5," The improved interface looks astonishing! The best app for those who really love podcasts and want to stay informed anywhere, anytime."
1813,Mark McDonald,"March 31, 2020",1," I can't sign in to Google Podcast. My subscriptions are no longer there. When I try to sign in, it give me an error saying an account already exists in this device."
1814,Kevin Walsh,"April 2, 2020",1, New update is lacking basic functionality. Podcasts end up buffering indefinitely even when episode is downloaded. Same podcast plays flawless on Spotify.
1815,Matt Gabet,"April 5, 2020",1, The new layout is awful! Scrolling the small podcast icons to find the one you want is difficult.
1816,jon winston,"April 22, 2020",4, They are building this airplane while it's in the air but it's almost there. Needs a Chromecast button in each podcast.
1817,Linus Lee,"April 5, 2020",1," Every time they make an update, they nuke existing settings and preferences and i lose saved podcasts. They are better, not careful alternatives."
1818,Patti Reich,"April 3, 2020",1, Gahhhh..... why did the interface have to change????? Now I need to get used to something that looks totally different. So annoying!!!!!!
1819,Matthew Wei,"April 3, 2020",2," Lots of buffering issues on podcasts now whether on wifi , or cell connection . Most pods stop about 2 minutes in and freeze."
1820,Rebecca Stapleton,"April 7, 2020",1," Setup now is terrible. Liked the easy way it used to be set up. That's why I liked it, not I can't stand your app."
1821,David Rittri,"April 7, 2020",1," I'm having the buffering after a few minutes issue, as well as it randomly changing from my set dark mode to light mode."
1822,Owen Zorge,"April 8, 2020",5," Great app. Easy to use, stable, all the podcasts I could ever want."
1823,B Cooper,"April 12, 2020",5," Excellent! Works with Google assistant, can playback up to 3x's regular speed, isn't draining my battery running in the background like my former player"
1824,Kevin Moore,"April 8, 2020",1, The new update doesn't display podcasts like it used. Navigation makes you scroll instead of just tiling them. No auto play next episode.
1825,Sajayen Moodley,"April 11, 2020",4, Really great. Improvements are definitely more frequent. Small app size is a bonus.
1826,THEARSEA Bourizk,"April 15, 2020",5, It's really fast to load it not slow i can hear it perfectly it also had every podcast i listen to love this really recommend it to you to use
1827,Karen Springer,"April 14, 2020",5, Has all of the podcasts I listen to. You can download and listen offline. Very intuitive and user friendly interface.
1828,Samuel Kyburz,"April 17, 2020",1, Keeps signing me out and when I go to sign in it says that the account is already linked to my phone. - Uninstall and reinstall helped but my downloaded episodes are gone
1829,Ahkil Mathew,"April 28, 2020",5, Dark theme at last after sooooooo long. About the app though it's the best i would recommend it over anything no ads no payment whatsoever....
1830,Thales Raphael,"April 27, 2020",3," Works well. but have a limit of playlist, you can't reach oldest post."
1831,Don Richards,"April 1, 2020",4, This things is great. Is like to see a way to simplify the list so I can switch to the next podcast while driving/distracted.
1832,Krishnendu Das,"April 26, 2020",1, Previous 5 star. But in my opinion new layup is not user friendly. Google podcast please bring back the old look. LOVED IT.
1833,Greg,"April 14, 2020",5," Keeps getting better and better. Love the new home screen, sleep timer, queue etc. Well done Google."
1834,alex Szabo,"April 14, 2020",2, New layout is awful. After trying to get used to it for weeks I am now trying to pick what app to replace this one with.
1835,Tristan Ramos,"March 31, 2020",4, I'll bump up to 5 stars once private rss feeds (like podcasts from patreon) are supported. I like the new interface. Also need a way to mark favorite episodes. Or maybe playlists.
1836,Petros Mazunda,"March 31, 2020",4, Awesome. And now the new layout is just so difficult to access podcasts I am not subscribed to. The new layout is not helping at all
1837,Jarom Winn,"March 3, 2020",2," Missing features that seem like no brainers. Lock screen controls, auto download, continuous play. Not a great experience."
1838,Alex Franks,"March 3, 2020",5," My favorite podcasts are very easy to find. I can easily start, stop and go back without issue."
1839,Nenad Arsovic,"March 2, 2020",2, I would love to see an option to search podcast episodes and store some under favourites. When that happens 5 stars. But for now only 2.....
1840,Peeran Makrabbi,"March 4, 2020",1, My downloads got deleted automatically!! Lot of bugs!! App just closes itself when I try to play a downloaded podcast!! What the h**!! Worst app!! Don't download!!
1841,Friedrich Dörmann,"March 5, 2020",1," Currently crashes if you go home, meaning if a podcast is running and I exit the app by pressing the home button, the podcast stops. Please fix that."
1842,Alexander,"March 10, 2020",5," Does what it says on the tin app. Clean features, free offline listening, massive selection of Podcasts. Probably the best podcast app I've used, surprised it wasn't pre-installed on my phone."
1843,Ryan Seaman,"March 11, 2020",4," Crashes occasionally during playback, and my saved position is last making me have to search through the podcast for where I was. Great otherwise."
1844,John Barnes,"March 13, 2020",3, Add dark mode and car mode. Add a filter that removes episodes that have been listened to already and only shows unplayed. Make the episode cards larger.
1845,Jennifer Vibbert,"March 12, 2020",4," New to it. Listened to a few. I wish there was a bookmark feature so I could click, if I needed to go back to a certain part."
1846,Kirill Fedtsov,"April 3, 2020",3, It is very desirable to add wishlist functionality and volume boost. Otherwise it's just a decent app.
1847,"Walter J McKee, Jr","March 18, 2020",3," It locks onto your audio in android 9 and will not clear audio when you close program. Figured out rest, except for clearing Audi, I like it."
1848,Jeffrey Fontecchio,"March 26, 2020",4," The new update is very confusing, I can not find what I am looking for in my subscriptions. I do enjoy the ""Your queue""."
1849,George de Naeyer,"March 26, 2020",1," Terrible navigation, can't save podcasts or subscribe to them. No way to control volume in the app when casting, have to use Home all to control volume."
1850,Asi Afuhaamango,"March 28, 2020",5, I love podcasts. One thing I've been trying to practice is listening to podcasts instead of watching TV. I enjoy the suggestions made based on what I listen to.
1851,Calla Dain,"March 28, 2020",1, New Update Is Garbage. I hate not having my favorite podcasts on the home screen. Now I have to go searching through an alphabetized list that I can't arrange myself? Switched to Pocket Casts.
1852,thomas cummings,"March 31, 2020",1, New layout is awful. Read the reasons why. Still awful. You should at least give the OPTION for us to switch to the old layout if we choose.
1853,Darren Dragoo,"April 1, 2020",1, Every podcast stops and buffers after about a minute or so. Only option is to force close app. Ive looked up every fix and nothing works. Layout also sucks
1854,Fernanda Lozano,"April 2, 2020",5, It's really really really great the sound is awesome and easy to use. Totally recomended
1855,Daniel Duffy,"April 3, 2020",1, Was a 5 star app until the new UI which is just terrible and the furthest thing from user friendly. Such a backwards step.
1856,Laura Jackson,"April 5, 2020",5, I have access to all the podcasts I love. Great app & I've had much use out of it.
1857,Nethan Paul,"April 7, 2020",5," The old update was easy to use. The new update is cool. Might take little time to adapt . Anyhow, Best podcast app ever!! Kudos!!"
1858,Jeffrey C,"April 3, 2020",1, New layout is horrible in Auto. The In-Progress tab has been removed which was the only real useful tab.
1859,lauren martin,"April 10, 2020",4, Worked fine before. Now It stops after a minute or so to buffer and won't start back.
1860,Nathan Scofield,"April 8, 2020",5," It's nice having all of my podcasts in one place, and such a user friendly presentation!"
1861,James Amacher,"April 12, 2020",5, Mush more user friendly and easier to access and keep track of my regular podcasts than Apple podcasts when I had an iphone.
1862,Josh Blome,"April 10, 2020",2," It works, but after the update it is harder to find new episodes of subscriptions I care about"
1863,Andrew M,"April 13, 2020",1, Go back to the old layout. New one is garbage. Cast button is gone too.
1864,Shabby incentian,"April 18, 2020",5," If you need a free podcast provider, then you must use this app. Its free and all the podcast are available here.. But i am getting some issues on streaming and using"
1865,Dylan N,"April 20, 2020",5," Great and it is completely free, the download feature is flawless and finaly the dark mode is great."
1866,Joel Cottrell,"April 22, 2020",5, Works amazing. Never had any problems whatsoever. Google keep apps coming like this.
1867,Justin Dendary,"April 22, 2020",1, New setup is awfulllllll. Auto play of next episodes no longer works. New set up is not user friendly in any way

1871,Avadhut Kulkarni,"April 7, 2020",1, Wow...latest GUI sucks......old was easy to use and just needed additional features...moreover all my subscription vanished just like that......
1872,Jonathan Stovall,"April 16, 2020",5, Love the app. Just wish it had a way to rate the individual channels.
1873,Jules Fox,"March 30, 2020",5, i really like what this app gives me. i like its layout & its huge selection of podcasts & its a tiny amount of data to download. Great!!
1874,Sumiyah Bintraafi,"March 24, 2020",3," Please allow for a ""favorites"" list!!! And even a ""want to listen"" type of list, or wishlist, or just give us the option to make our own lists"
1875,Eric Cagle,"February 27, 2020",3, Good when it works. Does not remember which podcast you were most recently listening to in Android Auto. Be prepared to resubscribe to your favorites.
1876,Kurt K. Torok,"March 9, 2020",3, Hate the fact the application notification doesn't go away unless I force the app to close or I need to reboot my phone. App works reasonably well otherwise.
1877,Milos Dobrosavljevic,"March 19, 2020",4, The app is great but a podcast queue list would be very helpful. I always need to unlock my phone to select next podcast and that is a little bit annoying
1878,Suzanne Lent,"March 16, 2020",5," Works great! Pauses from BT, easy to FF & RW. It even continues to play for a while when leave home with my data shut off."
1879,john zitta,"March 20, 2020",5, Being only very new this is a breeze to use. Very easy to find podcasts from around the world.
1880,Joel Monterrey,"March 20, 2020",4," It's an excellent app but it lacks many good features. Overall, it works well. I'd like the library to be expanded though."
1881,Amanda Josephine,"March 20, 2020",5, Love the variety of Podcasts on offer! Thank You to everyone who takes the time to provide this wonderful resource.
1882,Steven Appleby,"March 19, 2020",5," Love Podcasts in general. But, Dan Patrick puts much effort everyday on his shows. He is funny and a very intelligent man. Love the Danettes too."
1883,Schnoobs sc,"March 25, 2020",3," Guys, why change the interface? it was fine. Hate the new one. Hate having to swipe through all my podcast instead of being able to view them in grid form"
1884,JoElla Short,"March 25, 2020",5," There is a large variety of podcasts to select from, and you can download episodes for offline listening. My #1 go-to for listening entertainment."
1885,Harry Blauberg,"March 26, 2020",3," They removed the ""subscriptions with episodes"" view. Now I got only a timeline of everything with no order and a dumb list of my subscriptions. WHY are you messing this up?"
1886,Hugh Cawker,"March 28, 2020",1, New appearance is terrible. Shows me episodes I don't often listen to and I can't easily see all my subscriptions. Old layout was much better.
1887,DancerOfaDiscordantSystem,"March 29, 2020",1, New UI seriously sucks. Not user friendly at all. Bring back the grid so i can organize my subs. Ill probably be looking for a new podcasting app since this one has decided to sabotage itself.
1888,Brett Airs,"March 28, 2020",1," New update is confusing. Probably look for an alternative, which is unfortunate as I enjoyed the previous edition."
1889,Martin,"April 4, 2020",2, no option for Moving storage to SD card. And no possibility for saving playlists this app is rather minimalist lacking many of the sophisticated options that other podcast players offer. Uninstalled
1890,Thomas Wareham,"April 1, 2020",1," New update causes the podcast audio to just stop playing audio at random times because of ""buffering"" (even after downloading the episodes )."
1891,Robert Pleasanton,"April 6, 2020",2, I really hate the changes they made. It is now so much more difficult to find my subscribed podcasts and their new episodes.
1892,Richard Goreham,"April 5, 2020",5," Notifications and Auto Downloads, perfect. Continue listening on Home Speakers, amazing. Love it."
1893,Fox Spirals,"April 3, 2020",1, There's no next button. Layout is difficult and frustrating at times.
1894,Jeffrey Berezin,"April 10, 2020",5, Excellent podcast app. Works well with voice commands to skip forward or back also.
1895,Trav B,"April 12, 2020",1, Latest update is trash. Home screen too busy now and why bother downloading an episode when it starts to buffer and stop playing.
1896,Anubhi Saxena,"April 18, 2020",3, I loved the app because I can find all the podcasts here however I don't find the voice quality up to the mark
1897,Merlin's Son,"April 19, 2020",5, This app makes it easy to organize and plan how I hear my favorite podcasts.

1902,David Oram,"March 30, 2020",1, The new interface is very very difficult to navigate. Please revert to the old one or off to another platform.
1903,Jp Kaczur,"March 29, 2020",1, I used to love this podcast player but the redesign is horrible. It took outall the things I liked about it. I wish I could give the redesign a zero
1904,Lance J,"April 28, 2020",5," *Correction* It now has auto downloads! ""I love the simplicity but wish it had auto downloads."""
1905,Amanda Johnson,"April 21, 2020",1, Completely deleted my subscriptions with the new update and refuses to let me subscribe without creating a new Gmail account. I will be deleting this app.
1906,Kwasi Adjei-Frimpong,"April 4, 2020",1, The new interface is too cluttered and makes the app more difficult to use. Downloaded podcasts are buffering too
1907,Iain Davidson,"April 5, 2020",1," Latest update has made the app significantly worse. Bad layout, busy and less intuitive interface. Kind of wonder what the end goal for the update was.."
1908,Richard Fierro,"April 7, 2020",1, What happened to the app? Now it wont play the next episode. The product is much worse after the latest update. Did no one test that?
1909,Joseph Drake,"April 1, 2020",1," New version, new bugs. Downloaded podcasts intermittently buffer when out of cell service range. This app is trash."
1910,Sims Sqaurkar,"March 19, 2020",5, I use it on my old Android which is now my media controller at home. Nice simple interface. Just get it.
1911,brownat68,"March 31, 2020",5, The latest changes to this app make it a must have app for podcasts. It now has a download que and a removal after 24 hours. It also integrates seamlessly with your phone.
1912,Mike Munn,"March 3, 2020",1, Since last update app just seems to close itself every minute or so stopping playback. This makes listening to anything pretty difficult.
1913,Lisa S,"March 8, 2020",5," Easy to use, marks the episodes I have listened to, can make setting adjustments for speed and dead spots."
1914,David Blake,"March 6, 2020",5," I tried compiling my own podcasts from around the web, but I never knew Google had already done it for me. No better Podcast App out there."
1915,Prarthan Shah,"March 5, 2020",1, Have been using for a year but the new version keeps crashing. Needs to be solved with future update.
1916,Virginia Martinez,"March 9, 2020",3," Would like to see ratings (stars) for podcasts. I'm a new podcast listener, so I would find it helpful to know which podcasts are well received and read some reviews. Thanks!"
1917,Nate Meehan,"March 14, 2020",5," Works great , only complaint is when it buffers and restarts the podcast and it only happens for tin foil hat with sam tripoli. It never has done that for any other podcast i listen to."
1918,Nick Kemp,"March 15, 2020",5," Very useful, easy to use and simple design. Fits in well with the Google family of apps and services."
1919,Scott Haslam,"March 15, 2020",5, User friendly. A lot of great content. Large variety of choices. Excellent app for podcasts.

1921,Jordan Kelly,"March 24, 2020",3, Beautifully simple interface. Needs option to automatically download next episode for subscribed Podcasts. This option does not appear for me even though I have ready about the feature.

1924,James Barfield,"March 27, 2020",1, They ruined the user interface with the latest update and no option to retain the old interface. I will be looking for a different podcast app.
1925,Julia Fisher,"March 29, 2020",1, The new layout it horrible! Now I have to scroll through small icons to find my podcast. Please bring back old layout so I can sort podcasts however I want.
1926,Blissfuldana,"March 27, 2020",1," You broke it. The new update is not intuitive. Crashes often, after never having done so. Boo."

1928,Shadi El-Wahsh,"March 31, 2020",1, New layout is much more difficult to navigate. Podcasts now continue to freeze since the update. Was much better before the update
1929,Justin F,"April 1, 2020",2," New design is truly garbage. Slow downloads, bad organizational view. Previous version 5 starts, now looking for another app."
1930,James Hunt,"April 7, 2020",1, Downloaded podcasts no longer play uninterrupted. Absolutely useless app now. Keeps saying it's loading despite being downloaded.

1932,Ken Odom,"April 2, 2020",1, Epic FAIL with the latest update. And you can't even access their explanation for changing the interface.
1933,lj h,"April 4, 2020",5," THE BEST PODCAST APP. Really free. Get it now, I'm sure in a year or two it will be made to have a premium like YouTube... right now it's incredible thought. I recommend podcast Chasing Hermes"
1934,Tunca T,"April 3, 2020",4," Good app overall but cannot find some podcasts in search. For example ""Açık dergi"" podcast is still active and updating but I can't find it in the app."
1935,Raul Quiroz,"April 7, 2020",5, Love It. Every podcast I have ever look for is in here. The app is stable and allows to download for later listening.

2140,Nick Ra,"March 24, 2020",5," Nice! I use a Samsung Galaxy S3, which has an external SD card slot. Would it be possible for us to be able to choose where to store the audio files? This would be a very helpful feature."

2258,Kaviraj Soni,"March 23, 2020",4," UI could be more intuitive Edit : The new UI is super fluid, good job! Latest edit - opening app from the notification switches to the light theme ( im a dark theme user btw, system default selected )"
2259,Anuj Haribhakti,"March 29, 2020",1, Last update is made the mess of the GUI. I cannot sort my subscribed podcasts any more. It's pre sorted alphabetically

Definitel...Full ReviewRather than using social media and see all the negative things in the world. It's time to change our mindset and learn something new everyday.

I also don't think telling users the ""logic"" or reasoning behind it and linking a thread to why you forced this on the consumer is the right answer. We could talk about things before you force them on me. Options never hurts. Here's the new UI oh you don't like it ? That's fine you still have an option to go back.

Forward/back buttons removed from main screen.. app was usable from phone holder while driving, but now with multiple steps required to fast forward/rewind it's unusable. You used to be able to scroll through episode list quickly to find where you were up to as the played indicator was clearly visible on the right side, now the played indicator is mixed in with other stuff and it's impossible to tell where you're up to without scrolling through slowly. The best podcast app just became the worst podcast app. EDIT: as of the 5th of April, podcasts now play for about two minutes then the audio stops. The player still shows the podcast as playing, but there's no audio output. Happens on bluetooth, through phone speaker, and aux cable. Literally can't even do the one thing it's supposed to do. This app is pure garbage now."

A perfect example of this is when scrolling through the back catalogue on a podcast, the name or title of the episode now wraps to a new line included with the time and other small details, where as before they were separated neatly. I have gone back to Pocketcast because they have actually improved their user interface."

I did this due to certain development decisions by the PocketCasts team which I felt were against their original promises to their longer standing users. Another main reason was due to the lack of integration with the Google Assistant/Google Home infrastructure. Things I like: - recommended podcasts, clean UI, the slight rewind when resuming from a pause and Google Assistant/Google Home integration. Things I don't like: No custom lists - Please can I create my own lists to help manage backlogs or new podcasts that I've subscribed to and want to catch up over time. This would be a big help for those that listen while driving. Only being able to automatically delete after 24 hours - Should be able to delete immediately after listening. This is frustrating when trying to scroll through many undeleted, but listened to podcasts while driving. Random pauses in playback - Seems to be a bug. No autoplay of next podcast once one has been finished - This seems to be a function for a series by the same podcast, but not for different podcasts. Frustrating to try and manage whilst driving. For those new to podcasting, this is a great app. The recommended function is great to quickly grow your subscriptions, but user functionality is really lacking for the podcast 'veterans' who have many subs to manage and listen to."

So far I like it; one improvement would be the search feature. It seems to only search podcast titles not subjects.

4529,Steve Gonzales,"February 5, 2020",4," Solid, straight forward, bare-boned. I'd like to see more features added as others have mentioned, particularly the ability to rewind or fast forward from my lock screen. But overall, I enjoy the minimalistic feel of the app and the clean UI."
4530,Charles Lefort,"February 6, 2020",4," This app is fantastic. I get new updates and amazing podcasts every single day at my job the service here is spotty, but it is normally good from this app. One issue is some podcasts do not play the entire way. They drop out sometimes. But overall a great experience from this."

I wish I could import an OPML file that would bring my favorite list of podcasts over. I wish I could have a daily automated download that happens when I have wifi of my curated podcast list. I wish I could have it auto-sort these as oldest first (so that I can listen to the podcasts in the order produced).I wish I could set custom categories, so that my story-based podcasts can be played as a separate queue from my music-based podcasts. I wish that this app would let me cast it to my Google Home speaker, or to my Chromecast. I wish this app had a widget so that I could add it to my homescreen. I wish that this app would have more that just a basic play/pause option on my Android Wear watch."

There's no way to add an RSS feed from a patreon, the layout is bulky and not intuitive, there's no swipe option to download a podcast.

Decent player, but 2 persistent issues: A) the app stays in the Notification Panel even after I close the app and B) you can download episodes but there's no offline mode so once an episode ends it starts streaming the next episode if you haven't downloaded consecutive eps. So if you're trying to operate offline you're going to start streaming and/or you'll fill up your phone memory."
4544,Melissia Lenox,"February 27, 2020",5, Beautiful UI and vast selection of podcasts.

4548,Tim Matlack,"March 27, 2020",1," App has become nearly unusable after the last update. I download podcasts to my phone. During playback, they get hung up after playing about 3 or 4 minutes & it shows ""Loading"". Only way to get it to play again is start a different podcast, then go to the one you were playing. Terrible."
4549,Eric Swanson,"April 7, 2020",5, Updates make it a full-fledged podcast app!
4550,Zeeshan Shah,"April 12, 2020",1, After playing for a minute or two the audio stops and shows bufferring. Some other podcast apps are great and does not have such error but I like to use Google apps as my first preference. Otherwise it is OK. Please fix this issue!

4554,Michael Harrington,"February 7, 2020",4, Works great at playing the podcasts I want. The ability to control the speed and skip or reverse is really easy to use and helpful. The only complaint is the controls in the notification tray are a tad small and easy to press the wrong button.
4555,Crystal Barlow,"February 11, 2020",1," Like this app, very user friendly. However, it has a mind of it's own, it will stop playing when my device is locked and untouched, and start the episode in a random spot from where it left off. Very inconvenient especially while driving."
4556,Neal Morrin,"February 11, 2020",2, I actually really like the app itself but I found a few of the podcasts I listen to were missing all of their recent content (almost a years worth in one case) when other podcast apps had it. That makes it pretty unusable for me even if otherwise it's a really good experience.
4557,Dinesh Singh Rathore,"February 12, 2020",5," Google has created a simple, lightweight and easy to use podcasts app that is straightforward and to the point. While yes it has less features that other popular podcasts apps, it makes up for it well enough by making the best use of what it has."

4567,John Watt,"February 21, 2020",3," This app can never remember where it left off. You take a call, or switch to another source to watch a video, app will go back to the beginning or some other previous stopping points. This happens if the podcast is downloaded and is even worst if streamed."

4576,Benjamen Kozich,"February 24, 2020",1, This app is terrible. It freezes and shuts down. When it restarts it is way off of where I was. It doesn't auto download podcasts or manage them. It has a limited amount of podcasts vs other apps. I am so fed up with this I am switching.
4577,Benoît Deschamps,"February 28, 2020",4," Minus one start for the search engine, as you can't sort by category and it's not that great to browse until you find the category you want. Otherwise, their is so much variety it's just great. Also free content is really nice."

4583,Jose B,"February 3, 2020",1, I opened the app today and suddenly no episodes were marked as played. This is especially awful considering how tedious it is to mark episodes as played. I'd already been putting up with the inflexibility of things like sorting downloaded episodes and time to deletion after listening.
4584,Kevin High,"February 1, 2020",4, This is the podcast solution that SHOULD BE in Google music player. The podcast gallery and the more reliable refresh of RSS feed (getting your podcasts as they are published in the default player is impossible) makes you wonder why this podcast hasn't been rolled in to the Player already.
4585,patrick orlob,"February 9, 2020",2," Every now and then, I give Google Podcasts another shot, but it continues to lack functionality I've come to depend on from the app I continue to use (Doggcatcher). At the very least, get a home screen widget, just like G Music already has."

4587,Luis Rosales,"February 21, 2020",5," The Google Podcast app is well made. I enjoy the little things like the autoplay feature that allows the listener to automatically listen to the next newest podcast.

4588,Ferd Convery,"February 24, 2020",4," Only thing keeping this from being just about perfect is auto download over wifi. No reason why something so basic should be missing. Had to uninstall for this reason, but would be back in a heartbeat if that were made available."

4625,Kevin Smyth,"February 4, 2020",3, Not the best. Frequently get errors when starting a new episode or podcast. Audio drops occasionally when connected to Bluetooth and need to restart the app. Needs a lot of improvement before it's on par with the best podcast apps.
4626,Alexis Ricard-Châtelain,"February 7, 2020",3, Fine for talkshows and simpler audio material. But memory allowed for given buffer size isn't enough for complex program material such as continuous music mixes like BBC essential mix. Audio drop out every 30 seconds. This will surely ruin your half marathon...
4627,Esperanza Dubon,"February 8, 2020",1," Limited browsing - I can only search for a podcast I know by name or find one in the ""Top"" or ""Trending"" displayed on the home page, which is very limited. There is no option to just browse by category."

4629,Paaras Bhardwaj,"March 7, 2020",1," Pretty bad app. Extremely irritating to use. Regularly removes all downloads without you asking for the podcasts to be deleted .

You can download and play episodes without subscribing to a feed and it has the full episode descriptions in the app (something that's been hit or miss on other apps I've used). It's also been very reliable and bug-free on my Pixel. Unfortunately it has two huge failings for me - the biggest one is the lack of a way to make a playlist. You listen to one podcast at a time and that's it. There's no way to queue up more and since I usually listen to podcasts while driving there's no safe way to select a new one to play if my current one ends before my destination. This is such basic functionality in all the other apps I've used I don't understand why it's not here. The second issue is not a deal breaker for me but it also cannot be set to automatically download new episodes, so I have to hope I remember when I'm on a wifi connection to do so. Sadly going back to other apps for podcatching for now. I hope that it improves in the future as I like the look an feel enough to switch back if it ever gets the playlist function."

It tends to happen about once an hour or so, after which I have to turn on the phone's screen to manually press play to resume. Sometimes this restarts at a random place in the episode. Other times, it starts at the beginning of the episode. Rarely does it ever resume where it left off. Today, I listened uninterrupted for hours on a new device. As I was tooling around with the settings, I noticed that Podcasts once again reported, ""unable to play,"" shortly after I enabled data saver within the Google App's (aka Google Assistant) general settings. Although at this point it's just an anecdotal correlation, it's worth pointing out again that I had listened uninterrupted for hours before toggling on that setting. I've toggled Data Saver back on and I'll come back and edit this review when I have more to report. Anyway... the app still gets two stars since it's pretty basic. No automatic downloading of episodes. No dark mode. Notifications don't swipe away."

Clean interface, easy to find new podcasts, one tap listen, one tap play, easy to cast (other apps do this but not as easy), and shows what is played. It does NOT have: playlists, sort by genre (not an issue if you listen to a handful of daily podcasts, an issue if you listen to variety), no way to mark played/unplayed which makes it difficult to sift through new podcasts with older episodes, no stats (subscribers, update frequency, ect), download controls (other apps have this), and other fine tuned controls.

However, the search function (ironically) sorely needs work. You can't search for specific tags (or blacklist them), and search results seem to focus on specific episodes rather than a podcast/channel, which are an afterthought at the bottom. When I search for a keyword I'm usually looking for a specific podcast/channel, not a specific episode. Also, the search results only shows around 40 or less episodes, and he actual podcast/audiobook channel results that show up are even more limited. In other words, it's hard to find what you're actually looking for if you're looking for a kind of podcast or audiobook instead of looking for a specific title."

First off, this app looks great and is smooth as butter to use. Unfortunately, it's too simplistic. If you expect me to move over to this platform and don't give me the option to mark previous episodes as played (you can only do this one at a time), then I'm not moving. Also, where's the dark mode? And now the worst offense (which is driving my score): it's not 100% compatible with Android Auto! Sure, it will play, but it doesn't queue up your last episode, which means you have to open the app on your phone and play it. It's too unwieldy to attempt in the car if you have a ton off playlists. Worst of all, it randomly replays episodes. Nothing breaks immersion like finishing an episode and jumping into the next one, only to find out that you're listening to the same episode again! And this is the most frustrating thing about Google apps, they go so far and seem to just give up. I'm sick of the ""it's good enough"" attitude. Fix this app!"

My only suggestion would be away to move the cards around (as the newest episodes update?).

It randomly cuts out and will decide it can't play a particular episode anymore. The Cast feature seems to have been completely removed. Nearly every other podcast app is better, and it's Google so they'll probably end up killing it off soon anyway."

5040,Stephen Rossman,"February 4, 2020",1," Whenever my phone loses connection, the episode stops playing and loses track of where I was. So I either have to keep track every two minutes where I am or try to find it when the download fails."
5041,Patrick G,"February 1, 2020",3, Google has not put much effort into this app. It works fine for playing a podcast but there is almost no interface for finding and saving a list of podcasts.
5042,NiYaZ,"February 8, 2020",1, It's just a music player that doesn't play anythong and when you press play it will show that it's buffering. You can use this to fool friends and family but I find no practical use for this app.
5043,Hillary Hilderbrand,"February 14, 2020",4," This is probably the most user friendly podcast app! I would love it if I could put podcasts into a queue and arrange a playlist, but it's not a huge deal."

5048,Kurt Kearney,"February 21, 2020",4, Ease of use is great. Don't like not being able to search for a certain guest or topic within the podcast itself. Other than that everything works as it should.
5049,TA GAMING,"March 5, 2020",5, At this moment in time I love Google podcasts. It's a free service that I can enjoy while doing other activities. I can't say there is something that I have found that I don't like because I have not been using it very long. But as of now I love it.
5050,Greg Drigo,"March 29, 2020",3, New update sense pretty nice so far however the biggest issue is that the podcasts are ordered in a single line rather than a grid. It is far too difficult to search for podcasts with this new method
5051,Ben Hammond,"April 6, 2020",1, I can't get a podcast to play more than 3 minutes before it pauses itself and is unplayable unless I close the app and reopen at which point it only plays for another 3 minutes.

5064,Ahmad Khalil,"November 9, 2019",2," Should be redesigned to make it easier to navigate between episodes.

5066,Luke Watne,"November 19, 2019",1," I am frustrated with this app. Very often, my downloaded podcasts disappear minutes after downloading them. I then resort to streaming podcasts, but streaming is often interrupted and my place is lost. This is especially difficult to deal with when driving. Great idea, poor execution."
5067,Mandy Wilson,"November 27, 2019",3, Good app but can be better organized.It is hard to find podcasts and when you do it is hard to find episodes. You have to scroll through so many things to fi d what you are looking for. Also there has to be a better way to rewire d or fast forward. 10 second intervals is the worst.

Can get marginally better for example: 1. Allow queuing episodes 2. Give option of rearranging pod thumbnails in library 3. Offer a dark/night mode But otherwise almost there!"

5198,Matthew Bridger,"November 26, 2019",5," Really smooth and slick interface.
