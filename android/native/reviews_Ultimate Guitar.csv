Insulting after flipping past all the ads. Update: Nope, I just used your site for years. I only downloaded the app because the mobile site redirects you to the app if you try to do almost anything you used to be able to do (like even look at a chord diagram)."
1,Rochit Khatri,"April 29, 2020",4, Good app for chords and popular tabs. But it's a dumb app too.

Once you open a tab on the app you can't open something from chrome to app. And once you open something chrome to app then you only open the version you've clicked the link for. You want the same song? Search it again. I know these arw small but it's very annoying to use for a person who uses it everyday.
2,Hydra Thorn,"April 28, 2020",2," Not really a problem with ads, though it does get annoying when it plays ads with sound.

The main issue is how pushy the subscription is, to use the tuner, metronome, chord library, you have to pay a subscription for those, and to add on if your searching for a song and it only has one version of a chord or tab it's highly likely that it'll be a pro tab which you'll have to pay for. Pretty dumb design."

Now, even though it’s downloaded most of my tabs for offline, it still takes almost a full minute to open the app, go into favorites, click a song, and wait for it to load. There's just too much popup/dropdown junk and unneccessary ""featured"" vids that open up all the time that I have zero interest in seeing (sometimes 3 on top of each other!). At this rate I'm better off going back to paper, IT DOESN'T CRASH! Songsterr is cheaper and better!"

This has 100 different features and notifications that clutter up the screen that you can't just dismiss without letting it go through a spiel. Why am I going to upload a video teaching a song I haven't learned yet? I have 2 gigs of ram on device, and tabs take 3 minutes to load. They take 10 seconds in my browser on desktop. I respect the library size but make a lite version. Please?"

But have been disappointed lately on how the app is been operating. Will change rating when bugs are fixed. As of rn I want a refund.
10,Robbie Frechette,"April 18, 2020",5," Very useful, comprehensive and configurable.

Just 2 songs I've really wanted ukulele tabs for that aren't on here, but not their fault at all. I have premium and very happy with it!"
12,daniel rubin,"April 27, 2020",3," I had a 1-year subscription under an older account; three stars for a vast amount of songs available; my biggest complaint was the constant harassment and pestering from the app to vote on a song or other requests, with no way to turn them off. This ruined the ""vibe"". I will be looking elsewhere."

For bass players, it sucks, it says in the instructions to search for a tab then hit the filter button and then click bass. I do that and go back and there's nothing there. If I search again, it finds more guitar tab. So I'll be uninstalling, but maybe I'll recommend it for my guitar player friends."

But I would like to address a key concern to the devs: I understand that certain paid features are reqd to pay royalties, but making ""chord variations"" a paid feature is not in best interest as it makes no sense. It undermines the potential of this great service. Anyone internet can search it without paying a penny. Hence, a suggestion is to make this facility free and allow the users to show the customised variation, and thus make the app better."

I really like the ultimate guitar community, I love how you can post videos from the app and musicians from different places would find them pretty easily. The best part (for me) is that you are able to get a free month of premium just by uploading TABs. Just wondering, is there a way to search by genre?"
18,Phillfloyd1,"April 27, 2020",1," This app is complete trash. First it does not have that many tabs. Second they are not all correct. And third, the are so many ads that eventually you get to a tab and won't let you pass the ad unless you sign up. Total waste of time. I'd rather look up tabs online ( web browser) anytime I need one."

Specifically, the app is extremely slow and doesn't quickly load tabs offline. This kills momentum at bon fire jams. I can't quickly mute pro tabs clanky midi instr"
22,Grace McCorquodale,"April 28, 2020",5," This is a great app if you dont want to watch tutorials on how to play a song. It doesn't show you techniques but users of this app create shots and tabs for bass, guitar and more. You can also get the music so you can play along. This is all free unless you want to unlock feature on it."
23,Alex J Turo,"April 25, 2020",1," The full screen ads for addictive, predatory games you see before chords pages don't have an 'X' and you can't navigate back to the last screen so you have to restart the app and hope to get through without an ad. In it's current state, this clearly isn't usable without the premium content."

I tried filing for a refund through Google. Now they tell me it'll be 10 business days before I get my money back. It's only $20, but it's still the principal. Don't say it's free then charged me $20!"

Other than these two features, it is indescribably terrible and invasive. It is clearly designed with only the company's interest in mind andwith no regard for user experience.

27,Jessicat,"April 24, 2020",5," Really great way for beginners and pros alike to learn new stuff on guitars! You have the option to pay for pro version, but without it the app is still amazing as there are an endless amount of community made tabs and chords for any song you want to learn. Fantastic app!"

29,Radim Qetzalcoatl,"April 19, 2020",3," It drains my battery like crazy. It keeps crashing, freezing, and misbehaving. BUT It's still a great tool and an almost infinite library of songs. This app is worth the hassle, because of the awesome fans, who provide the free content in it."

Edit: I reinstalled to give it another try and I stand by my original opinion other than that the free user made tutorials are generally good, there is only a ""small selection"" per song by ""users"" not ""tabs writers""."

A few things would be an improvement. 1) Please find a different way to delete favorite tabs instead of trash cans along the side of the screen where you touch to scroll. 2) Please add a chord chart arranged by key...it would be more useful than the current chord library. 3) Please add an interactive chord wheel.

33,Kathryn Graham,"April 29, 2020",3," The app is fine, although the UI is a little confusing and they insist on putting in a pointless social network I don't care about. It's also annoying to have to pay for features that are free on browser. I already have a premium account, I just find it obnoxious."

I would like to share an idea with you. Developers should make a LITE version of this app, with just the tabs, favirite option and listen option. Personaly that would suit me the best, cuz most of the stuff is for ""pro"" version so whats the point of a ""pro tab"" in a search if Im not a pro user. Its just gonna prompt you to get ""pro""."
35,ak army,"April 27, 2020",5, It is a nice app with all popular songs. The official version of the songs are not free but there are other version which are absolutely free. You can try and practice different versions according to your wish
36,Oliver Erlandsson,"April 26, 2020",5," Love the app. Extremely helpful for learning how to play and is very fun to for both beginners and pros. Me and my father uses this app a lot for learning and playing together. I've learnt how to play three songs in one month. Amazing app, so happy I downloaded this."
37,Fran Sutlić,"April 23, 2020",1," its bad, ads poping up over chords, basic features like autoscroll are locked behind a paywall so Im uninstalling this in anger for the second time after giving it another chance. its easier to find normal chords online than this. Let me repeat, AN AD WAS OVER THE CHORDS, not in between, OVER!"
38,Jacob G,"April 29, 2020",1," No tips for beginners and it keeps popping up telling me to record when I can't play a single chord without a ""boink"" sound and some strings refusing to vibrate. It seems a good app, but it's not at all for absolute beginners like they say."
39,Austin Paynter,"April 22, 2020",5," Amazing app for pros and newbies. Being able to find all the tabs i could want in one space is awesome in and of it self, but the additional features the app has like offline access for your favorite taps, or auto scrolling while you play (at the tempo you choose)."
40,Madison Green,"April 21, 2020",4, Really easy to use! I think its relatively beginner friendly. My only comment would be is i would like to be able to do some of the things you can do on a desktop on mobile to (like transposing for example)
41,Jaylee Nan,"April 18, 2020",5, Love this app! Its great for praise and worship! The only advice I would give to better the app is to make it to where you can arrange to the playlist as you wanted. It's in alphabetical order as of now!
42,Charlotte Porter,"April 28, 2020",1, Total waste of time... adds everywhere. Not able to read lyrics or see the chords which you would think would be the point.... and your charge for this? Get it together !
43,Dumble Dore,"April 24, 2020",2," It had all the potentials of becoming a really great app, except for the fact that it takes forever to load the chords sometimes, and all the ads bombarding everytime I open up the chords for a song."
44,Paul Callaghan,"April 23, 2020",1, The tab the app chooses is so bad and inaccurate and you have to actually search harder to find a good tab; I may as well just use the normal internet. This app is nowhere close to worth the money. I would ask for a refund if I could
45,Tony G,"April 18, 2020",5, Wonderful app! Has many versions of a song if one doesn't sound right. Also has easy ways of seeing the same chord in every position to find the one best suited to your needs or skills.
46,Ryan Murphy,"April 21, 2020",1," Ok for tabs. But adverts cover content and app should be called a 'Sapp', because it saps battery! Real battery killer. Probably the fault of all the adverts, because fundamentally it's just an app that shows word documents uploaded by users."
47,João Manero,"April 21, 2020",5, Be it the free version or the premium one this apps deserves all the credit it has been given. Amazing app that accompanied me throughout my journey with the guitar. Keep up the amazing work! Much love.
48,ELLEN GERVACIO,"April 25, 2020",1," I just downloaded this app. I tried to ""tune"" my guitar. So when I was ""tuning"" it. It says it's too low so I kept tightening thestrings..but then after a few more tightening my guitar's string broke.My ring finger is bleeding and I can't play my guitar."
49,Zee Ski,"April 20, 2020",5," I wish I had this when I was younger. I'd be a better guitar player with a larger pool of songs to play and more knowledge of scales. I bought the full version, worth it!!!! And keeps asking me to review it"
50,Mike Phang,"April 19, 2020",3," Spotify integration is not working. Click ""sign in"" from a tab using the ""youtube icon"" button on the top right and it flashes ""Loading"" then nothing. Also saw a quick error message about ""explicit permissions"" i think."
51,Scott Saulnier,"April 17, 2020",5," Love this app and web site. Tabs and chords are usually spot on and make for easy learning. Been playing since the 80's and to have all this music at my finger tips literally, is simply awesome. Thanks ULTIMATE GUITAR"
52,Nash Knowlton,"April 27, 2020",5," It is an amazing app with all the guitar tabs and chords you would ever need, I just wish there was more instruments such as mandolin. But other then that, it's an amazing app!"
53,Jason Moore,"April 18, 2020",5," Actually use it alot, tab for most guitar and bass. Ability to adjust the speed of the song if played. Tons of reference material and community. Thanks for such a great tool."
54,Dj Boone,"April 22, 2020",1," Great app except the fact you can't filter songs based on Tuning. The only options they give you is ""Standard"" and ""Half-Step Down"". Change this and I will change my rating."
55,James Kaye,"April 24, 2020",5, Really impressed with this app. And going pro is a very fair price. Less than £2 a month. Knocks yousician out the water for me. I'm at best a novice and found this incredibly easy.
56,DatRollinPotato,"April 12, 2020",1, I found their website helpful and decided to try the app. I've had it for a few days but everytime I try to open it it crashes. I much more prefer the website over this app that doesnt even load/work.
57,Jacques Blignaut,"April 23, 2020",5," Absolutely amazing. This app has taken my guitar playing to the next level. So easy to navigate, create, search, improve and its always up to date. Well done!"
58,Isaiah Perry,"April 21, 2020",5," Been using this app for years! Although I tend to learn songs better from videos, this is app is a great way to find chords for many of your favorite songs. Great Job!"
59,Jahkelo Joseph,"April 26, 2020",2," If you dont already know what you are getting into with the pro version, dont think about the free trial unless you plan on giving away $20 just to see what its like for one day."
60,Jaime Ramirez,"April 29, 2020",5," I've always loved the website and now it's an app! I just have a concern, I bought the app subscription twice on accident and I'd like a refund on the 19.99 purchase haha"
61,Pravan Ray,"April 26, 2020",5, Overall the app is really awesome.but it is a bit glitchy. It gets stuck sometime. U should try to make tge interface more user friendly. Make the collections more easily accessible.
62,Thomas Bright,"April 18, 2020",2," Wow. Used to be so good, but now too many ads and now blocked with your subscription offer. What a scam. Not all guitar players are high. Never use again."
63,Kate Gustafson,"April 22, 2020",5, Love the ukulele options! I've been using this app for years and I'm so happy you can switch between guitar and uke chords again. Thank you so much!!!
64,Maru,"April 24, 2020",4," The app would be perfect, but long loading of tabs and lags are really disturbing. Althrough this might be problem of my phone (Huawei Y6 Prime 2018), which is not the fastest so keep that in mind. 😇"
65,Sean Matthews,"April 28, 2020",5, This app is amazing! Very detailed. Now if only I didn't suck so bad I can hardly play anything. This will be the way to learn thank you ultimate guitar you guys are awesome
66,Richard Riordan,"April 22, 2020",5, Great app with user reviewed tabs. You can also record videos of yourself playing as you learn. They have a multitude of lessons and other features i haven't even delved into yet.
67,Rachel Obbema,"April 22, 2020",5," Really easy to navigate, loads of songs, cool add ons, although I haven't yet managed to have my Spotify linked yet- but that's something you could do too. Great app!!"
68,Wickus Booyse,"April 22, 2020",1, App is installed. Everytime i click on the open in app button it takes me to the bloody google play store to open app via play store... Every bloody time. Cant use any song link on the website because it runs into this cycle the whole time...
69,Bernard Sergeant,"April 23, 2020",4," Excellent for the most part, the tabs are pretty accurate unless put up by a member who has their own opinion on how the song should be played."
70,Alexandre Arana,"April 24, 2020",1," This site was amazing a few years ago. Now it just became very complicated, not user friendly and too expensive considering others that are free. Not worth it."
71,Jizzel Mcdaniel,"April 28, 2020",5, This app is awesome. It's all anyone needs to learn how to play and more. Great job creaters. And thank you. I never give ratings on apps either.
72,Xtine Maniego,"April 19, 2020",1, I was charged the Welcome Offer rate but I can't use the Pro features like the auto scroll. What's up with that?! What a rip-off. Totally unacceptable!
73,Felix Yelovich,"April 26, 2020",1, The app is poorly developed and not useful. The company is lying about free trial. they charged me $10 and refuse to refund after I canceled the trial. Do not sign up. Plenty of better apps out there.
74,Mike Beasley,"April 29, 2020",5, Very new to playing guitar. I like it for sure n has helped me tremendously. But for people like me who are not computer n phone geniuses. I still have been able to learn quite a bit. N look forward to more.
75,Jake Kennard,"April 24, 2020",4, Wide selection of songs. Do wish there was more in the way of training/ learning but there's enough available to find that there might as well be.
76,Roderick Sember,"April 26, 2020",5, I've been playing guitar for a while and just recently broke down and subscribed and I'm glad I did. The time it takes to learn songs has been cut down dramatically.

Ads now take 100% of screen regularly, most of the functions are paid and so on. Maybe 3-4 years app was good, but not now at all."

Not including it in the free version with ads is just greedy. Also bc of the formatting it just makes more sense to look at it online or use a different service.

265,Matthew Simpson,"February 5, 2020",5, I have been using this app for almost ten years now! It is my favourite app for learning new songs on the guitar! Upgrading to Pro is definitely worth the buy. It allows you to practice along with the rhythm of the tabs. You can even slow the tempo down or loop a section for trickier songs.
266,Jackson Woodard,"February 20, 2020",5, It was a great app when I bought it years ago. Now its forcing me into subscriptions and making it so I cant use the guitar tuners anymore.

314,Fabian 17,"February 25, 2020",1," It's been a month since my last complain about not being able to edit lyrics n chords in UG due to the lyrics n screen being completely white when in edit mode, even after resetting all settings.. I was told that the issue will be fixed in future updates, but it still has not been fixed..."
315,Keith Oliver,"February 17, 2020",4," Great app! I wish there was a way for saved songs to retain their scrolling speed. Also each song, when loaded, should zoom to the max width of a verse by default. Right now you have to set these manually each time the song is loaded."
316,Puia Lusei,"March 20, 2020",1," Do not download this app. I think they fixed the crashes. But it's still BS. You have to pay to get most of the features. Auto scroll and tabs. Most of the songs are behind the subscription wall. I repeat, do not download unless you want to waste time and money."
317,Zach,"April 3, 2020",1," Horribly laggy, terrible UI and incessant shoving the paid version down your throat. The app is genuinely horrendous if you aren't willing to spend 30 dollars. For information i can get for free on several other websites."
318,Ria Villena,"April 7, 2020",5," I'm a beginner and the very cheap price of 159 php PER YEAR is affordable. I really like this app. Thanks for making this. My mother would play chords from the free version and she said she likes the app too, just like in her old guitar song books."
319,Jesse Moore,"April 12, 2020",5, Pro version is very high quality. Please make the chords not highlighted in gray though they are very hard to see sometimes. Just plain white background would be easier.
320,Maria Gardner,"April 21, 2020",5, I've learnt soo much over the past year. G tabs gives you the opportunity to not only learn your favorite song but the guitar chords as well! This app has helped me and my friends with our worship sets. This app is awesome I definitely reccomend this app for anyone who is looking to learn guitar :)
321,james morris,"April 26, 2020",5," Still more improvements needed, but it's very good guitar tab app."
322,Raj Rana,"February 20, 2020",3, app is good for music but takes too much resources.. crashes repeatedly takes forever to load again.. does not remain open in background as it takes so much ram.. i wish they made this a bit lighter.. ive been a paid user for 5 years but current experience is the worst..
323,Ted Meyer,"April 1, 2020",5," I have searched for and downloaded perhaps 100 songs. Having the ability to transpose into any key, simplify chords, have several versions, and various tracks available is great for a player like me (with limited ability and vocal range)."
324,Ilia Zhuravok,"April 11, 2020",4," It's a good app, huge library, but, personally for me, too many restrictions for free version. I think you should make a bit more functionality available for free."
325,Edward Jimenez,"April 13, 2020",5, Great resource for guitar chords and really helps me prepare for performance. I would recommend to all skill levels. Especially like ability to edit save and print.
326,Jhane delvalle,"April 29, 2020",5, I like it. Easily to use and to follow chords
327,Mike Oliver,"February 24, 2020",1, Installed and found the song I wanted but the ads kept blocking opening the page. Hopeless if you can't open the song page. I'll go back to the PC version and delete this app. Thanks for your very quick reply. Will try again.
328,Phil Taylor,"February 8, 2020",5, I've used this service for what must be a decade and it has been my constant companion for both finding tabs for songs I love as well as a resource for publishing songs of my new and favorite artists. Thank you to the UG team for this excellent app.
329,Mahy Hussein,"February 21, 2020",2," Besides the annoying ads, I'm seriously curious as to why this app DRAINS the battery so bad... I started learning guitar on ultimate guitar when I was a teenager and seeing from how it started to going to this is just a shame.. even stopped paying for premium because it just wasn't even worth it."
330,Eric Ouimet,"February 29, 2020",4," Too bad the Tab isn't introduced like Rocksmith. Played the easiest Base tab but listening to the video, helps just as much as the tab itself. DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE TO GIVE A 500 WORD COMMENT. Just to give my input but I can go on and on....."
331,Jessica Massa,"March 12, 2020",5," This app is amazing and has added so many awesome features since i first found it years ago. Useful, simple to use, so many options for different levels and resources. I can't say enough good things about it. Loyal to this app and originally to the site"
332,Bill TELLEFSEN,"March 23, 2020",5, Very many songs with multiple ways to interact and learn. Great for folks who need a bit of help remembering lyrics and/or chords - especially when around a campfire! Good for beginning bands to find & learn old songs as well as new stuff.
333,Makayla Jaden,"March 23, 2020",5," I'm only 14 years old and I know over 60 songs because of this app. It's so easy to use, it makes learning songs so easy and you can find almost every song in the world that you want to play! I highly recommend this app, it's helped me alot!"
334,Angel Reyes,"April 11, 2020",5," Worth the extra $$ each year, it's not much and the service you get is well worth it. Yo! You can connect your Spotify and find tabs that way! It's fun app to keep playing :)"
335,David Long,"April 11, 2020",5, Adding the feature to find tabs by what you listent to on Spotify is simply amazing. Thanks guys! Keep up the good stuff. How about being able to search for tabs by tuning again as well?
336,Blaise Reinbold,"April 24, 2020",2, Signed up with a card for the 7 day trial and it won't let me use any of the tools and keeps showing me adds
337,andyyniable,"April 26, 2020",1," VERY ANNOYING, THE SITE'S BASCALLY FORCING ME TO DOWNLOAD THE APP. Once you have the App it will then force you to Subscribe and Pay or else NOTHING EVER LOADS"
338,Shaleyah Jenks,"March 31, 2020",5," AMAZING!!!!!! Works for all instruments, doesnt show you how for all instruments but shows you chords for all instruments. One flaw is that it isn't always in the same key as the original but if you get the pro version you can transpose it to the right key"
339,Jawahar Namburi,"April 1, 2020",5," Its awesome , I love this site very much because I can find so many variations and scales to learn a particular song. The chord combination is always fantastic and upto the mark."
340,Izzy Howat,"March 5, 2020",1, Was trying to see the PDF of a tab on my phone but got an error message that I could only see it in the app. Download the app and clicked on PDF only to be told I need a premium membership. I'm not a fan of these kinds of deceptive practices
341,Antzy X,"March 7, 2020",4," I'm knocking off a star because the app resets to Home page if it gets resized, e.g. when I switch it to half screen to use along with a YouTube video. But all in all, an amazing app. Has almost everything I need to get playing. And of course the best repository of tabs available."
342,Leon Smith,"March 8, 2020",5," Finally! An app with the tab to the songs I actually want to learn! I used Yousician previously to learn bass, but most of their songs are their own. With Ultimate Guitar I can now jam along with whatever song I want, instead of what the app wants."
343,Ryan Yelvington,"March 21, 2020",5," Ultimate guitar has made learning new songs easy and accessible, which has been great as a novice. Their library is massive (I've only ever not found a single song). I highly recommend the premium option if you're want high quality tabs with things like adjustable playback speed."
344,J T,"March 26, 2020",1," I can't even look anything up without being prompt to purchase the pro version. And of I go on the website it has a pop up that comes right I the middle of the screen over the tabs telling me to download their ""free"" app. I'm very unimpressed ..."
345,Pat Nicholson,"April 1, 2020",4," Very good. Thank you😁 Grew up with Guitar Maagazine. What 4 songs came out is what you got. Buying band and album books was great, if I could find what I listened to. Thanks technology, and thank you Ultimate Guitar."
346,Eric Dodds,"April 4, 2020",1, Bombarded with personalization I don't want and invitations to pay money. The web version would be fine without the ads for the app. The app itself is too annoying to be worth figuring out.
347,alistair cheshire,"April 11, 2020",5," Brilliant app. All the chords, solos and more, for all the songs you love and plenty more. Excellent for beginners and old hands alike."
348,SALU - LS,"April 26, 2020",5, Awsome app.. u have to add more banks like idbi bank... i cant purchase the app through my visa card.. one of ma fav app... please fix this...
349,Vulval Blowfish,"March 27, 2020",5," I looked up a song online using a browser on my phone; the chords were hidden with an ad for this app. I installed the app, but couldn't look at the song without a constant loop of ads to pay and 'upgrade to pro...' covering the song up. Caved, paid... worth it."
350,Scott Moore,"February 16, 2020",5, Absolutely the best app. I advise going pro. Only $15 a year! AMAZING! Edit: I've had this over a year and I'm still amazed how handy and easy it is to use and literally and song you want to learn
351,Ladell Neitzel,"February 12, 2020",5," I so desire to have songs i can give myself to ABBA thru and Tabs makes that possible in innumerable ways from having lyrics, chords do i can play, transposing and listening to how the song was meant to be played. This is a gold mine for all worshippers!!!!"
352,Fathima Bee,"February 14, 2020",4, It is a great app but the chords are difficult you should try to put in the numbering kind of thing which is basically six horizontal lines represent the string the on the string the certain chord is supposed to be played write the number that represents the frets on the 1st 2nd or 3rd 😁
353,Neil Daga,"March 26, 2020",5, Tried and true app for beginner guitarists. They've built a great community of musicians over the years. I appreciate that users can still use the app for free if they don't need all the features that come with the full version.
354,Walter Cotton,"March 31, 2020",5," This is a great app for the musician to play their favorite tunes. I held off on buying for some reason, but so glad I did. Love scrolling option. Speed control and font for my bad eyes."
355,Nick Bartolotta,"April 3, 2020",5, Great to learn any song. I usually play music off YouTube Music and from there if I hear a song I like and that I think I can play I switch over to the Ultimate Guitar app and look the song up np.
356,Stephen Twine,"April 4, 2020",5, Great app maybe make it a little little cheaper i would gladly pay 50 rands a year once off fee or even a month by month Zar10 fee non renewable to access an app like this once or twice a week or month when i occasionally feel like playing a guitar
357,Ninja T,"April 7, 2020",5," I love the many varied verions of some songs and that there's other chords/tabs for than just the guitar. Also the milion+ database of songs is incredible, and I've been using ultimate guitar tabs n chords for about 8years or so 😁😎 <3 xxx"
358,Guillermo Figueroa,"April 11, 2020",5, Really great app in learning songs for guitar. I wish in the virtual guitar in the button they had the number of fingers instead of the blue dots. Either than that I love this app.
359,Jarod Hart,"April 11, 2020",4, Pretty awesome little community. Be great if more of the songs had rythim patterns but can't blame that on the app I'm into some pretty indie stuff. Most mainstream songs you'll find strum patterns.
360,Sian Herbert,"April 4, 2020",5," Amazing app, thank you for bringing the songs into my fingers (much easier than working them all out ;-) Also thanks for the tech support response to my previous review comment. That sorted it"
361,Kei Bevido,"February 9, 2020",5," 2020 EDIT: Shouldn't review/edit while pissed. Support from UG proved it was a matter of updates and new device issues. Have faith in UG, great CS; I'm STILL here. So is all music and my original account.

Support from UG proved it was a matter of updates and new device issues. Have faith in UG, great CS; I'm STILL here. So is all music and my original account. Will prob always use this app as long as everything gets sorted out if something happens again. Music is easy to find, various versions to point me in direction I couldn't find ...etc etc. I use android's now. Opened acct on computer yrs ago, it's still convenient n accommodating as ever."
362,David Harris,"February 17, 2020",1," Maybe there are a million free songs, but they won't be songs you've heard of or want to play! Every search I did came up with only versions needing a pay subscription. Pop up ads were also annoying."
363,Stephen Siebert,"April 5, 2020",5," So helpful! The free app is amazing, I can't describe how pleased I am with the pro version now. Learning songs has never felt so easy."
364,Hollie C,"April 13, 2020",2," The app used to be a lot more user friendly, until they started putting features behind a pay wall. Ads are constant and so irritating, making this app barely usable."
365,DeviaNdaru Epil,"April 4, 2020",2, My video can not appear. Even cannot record a video. It was green with stripes Terminated when done in 15 swcond. Im a pro customer. But why it happens to me? Do I have wrong settings?
366,Andy Jeffs,"March 20, 2020",5, I've been using UG for over a decade. It keeps getting better. Paid for a lifetime membership a long time ago and it's easily paid for itself. I was able to develop a professional repertoire of over six hours with help from this app. Thank you so much.x
367,Andrew Lozano,"February 19, 2020",5," Great app! Has most of the songs I want to look up, and play. I have taught myself to play guitar within a few month by looking up songs and playing the corresponding tabs."
368,pheera roekkamon,"February 5, 2020",1," I have a problem, I unsubscribe from app but some how an auto-transaction payment has been made from my PayPal account without my permission and I'd like to request for a refund as I didn't want to renew my account, really disappointed...."
369,Christiaan Lewis,"February 6, 2020",5," I just recently started playing guitar and I gotta say, this really helped me . Look its got some stuff that could be worked on but all in all this is a great app thanks for creating it..."
370,Patrick Butas,"February 20, 2020",5, Very Impressed with this App But I'm Broke so as soon as I get some Loot I will pay. Anther cool thing is if you get Stuck wondering how the hell do you play this? You press that button and it plays the verse or Lead your trying to Learn. Why Is Everyone Complaining??????Dam
371,Red Riding rails,"March 20, 2020",5," I couldnt play a single thing. Nor could i understand strum patterns but thanks to your app im happy to say my dream of preforming both, my vocals and playing a instrument is on its way!!! Thank you thank you thank you. I cant stop practicing with the tabs my fingers are sore 😄"
372,Bridget Moran,"March 31, 2020",5," I've been using UG for ten years. I love the app and its features and I've always found it easy to navigate - especially now being connected to Spotify, finding chords & tabs for new songs I discover is that much easier."
373,Kendell Gregory,"April 1, 2020",5," This app is everything I ever dreamed of when I was first learning in middle school back in the late 90s, so easy to use and allows you to learn tablature as well as countless chords."
374,guy g,"April 5, 2020",5, Love the app! I can toggle between guitar and ukulele. The different versions of songs let's you pick which you prefer. Love that there are strum patterns available
375,Robert T. Plant,"April 13, 2020",2, I dont like how im forced to download the app to continue to properly view content . . Adding to my second issue where as i keep getting hassled to pay and sign up for service. Thumbs Down for this app. Uninstalling this app.
376,Ezekiel Rahman,"April 26, 2020",5, An excellent resource for learning my favorite songs.
377,Shane Peden,"March 29, 2020",5, Great resource for anyone who loves guitar. The built-in tools like the metronome and tuning are also great. Saves me from having to install more apps. Love the feature that lets people share videos of them playing as well.
378,Raj Enterprises,"March 20, 2020",3," Thanks bro for creating your app.I don't have any type of guitar But I have many instruments on My Mobile phone.By finding out the lyrics,tabs,chords,scale and strumming patterns of songs,I enjoy playing guitar which is actually amãzing.I just wanna thank you bro.Thank you.I I request you to please ...Full ReviewThanks bro for creating your app.I don't have any type of guitar But I have many instruments on My Mobile phone.By finding out the lyrics,tabs,chords,scale and strumming patterns of songs,I enjoy playing guitar which is actually amãzing.I just wanna thank you bro.Thank you.I I request you to please make all features free. .. What about those who are not able to buy premium? Please make an update and allow all features..please...."
379,Ender Vincent,"February 3, 2020",5," I didn't really think I needed this app until I got it, before I was using free tabs from different sources but this app has almost everything you want learn and different tabs for each including simplified chord versions of song, highly recommend this app to anyone"
380,Carlos Canchola,"February 16, 2020",5, I think it's the best app available out there for learning songs on guitar. Sadly you must pay a premium for most official tabs but the app still has a wide variety of songs available for free.
381,Raymond Berry,"March 6, 2020",1," not for me. ultimate guitar sold out. not very useful in free mode. yes, they need $, but I don't need to pay for features on other sites for free. most of the library was put together for free by other artists to share. too bad."
382,M,"March 10, 2020",2," Even after downloading the realistic sounds, it still sounds terrible compared to the desktop version. Particularly the slides, and hammer on/off sound awful. Please give it the same quality as desktop."
383,Richard Roulette,"March 21, 2020",5," It's cool I'll add my tabs as I see fit.Its kind of like Harmony Central, OLGA, Cowpie Bunk House, and our other traditional gathering data group sites that made up the union of music chords lyric intros bridges tablature you can actually make a difference where people can ask you so you can actuall...Full ReviewIt's cool I'll add my tabs as I see fit.Its kind of like Harmony Central, OLGA, Cowpie Bunk House, and our other traditional gathering data group sites that made up the union of music chords lyric intros bridges tablature you can actually make a difference where people can ask you so you can actually broaden your horizon and hell maybe mentor a little and pass down this great tradition keeping music in our family for no end to generation..Yahoo Boys Dad just got back to another root of Traditio"
384,NIck B,"March 24, 2020",5, Definitely one of my most used apps. I am generally able to find virtually any tab I'm looking for. The app is continuously being worked on. I found paying for pro to be well worth it.
385,Ernesto Zarate,"March 26, 2020",3, Decent app. you have to some rhythm of your own to get songs down. Some tabs give you half of the play nd you just fill in the missing piece. All I'm trying to say is it's a decent app but you have to put in some work.
386,mireya carrillo,"April 1, 2020",5," The best app for learning! It has all the tabs, the strumming and you can play along with it when you're ready. I absolutely love it!!!"
387,BARRY BULLARD,"April 4, 2020",5," got this with a discount, excellent 👍, I use it more for jogging my memory than out and out learning a tune ( there's always video sites if you want note for note) every tune I wanted"
388,Peter Downham-Clarke,"April 14, 2020",5," Use it all the time, find the app really useful, feel it could do with a delete feature when songs have been loaded into the song list and are not required."
389,Baldy Dude,"April 27, 2020",1, I cant find an option to cancel subscription and I'm getting annoyed! Somebody get back to me
390,Josh Vickers,"April 25, 2020",5, Great for getting tabs. easy to read and understand
391,Caroline Colesworthy,"April 28, 2020",5, Makes learning new songs really easy. I love this app.
392,C JD,"March 13, 2020",3, This app is really good at helping me finding tabs but is it just me that I found this app is a really battery killer? Even an hour this app drains much more power than my games. I gave it 3 stars because this app is screwing my battery up.
393,Nachy Faiman,"February 13, 2020",5, Love this app it really helps me get better at guitar and is really simple to use I highly recommend this app to anyone that wants go learn how to play every song in the book. Awesome app. Thanks
394,Davide Basilio Bartolini,"February 15, 2020",4," The app works well, nice that the subscription works across devices. Only shortcoming so far is that there seems to be no way to *only* show the standard notation and hide the tab. The option to show standard notation adds it along with the tab."
395,Jordan Siebe,"March 1, 2020",5, Have had nothing but a great experience with the app for many years now. Would recommend for any musician. Especially great when I am on the go or need to reference a specific song.
396,INDIA BROWN,"March 24, 2020",5," Helped me learn the guitat from the beginning, and I still use the app very often. I love the 'favourites' feature, it helps me keep track of all the songs I have learnt in the past!"
397,Steve Martin,"April 15, 2020",5, App is pretty cool! Iv had it for 5 minutes and love it! Im shy and nervous to expose myself playing to others but here with this app im open and comfortable. Lots and lots of great players!
398,abhishek sharma,"April 26, 2020",5, The ultimate app you need for chords...best devs...best guitarist...awesome lessons...best community.highly recommended
399,Rianda Rizza,"March 27, 2020",5, This what I called a 5 star apps. Totally worth the money. I know this is a guitarist apps but me as a piano player found it very useful. I wish I it can get a compatibility with my digital piano pedal so I can switch page
400,Super Shy Girl,"April 4, 2020",5, App is absolutely amazing! Has all my favourite songs with chords that anyone is capable of playing for more than one instrument! So glad I found this app! :)
401,Chance Mattox,"February 22, 2020",3, I use it but it actually makes it harder to get to the tabs I was using before downloading it. I literally only downloaded it to see cord charts and now it is trying to force me to pay to use the tabs I was using before I downloaded the app.
402,Chris Rockwell,"March 21, 2020",5," Hours of content, lots to learn, being very new to guitar it can be a little overwhelming but once you figure it out some it falls into place pretty well. Would recommend this app and plan to continue using it myself."
403,Eva Loren,"March 24, 2020",5, The community is great. It is very simple to nacigate and is still very good even if you don't get the premium version. It is very helpful and has help so much in improving my playing.
404,Todd Asbill,"April 12, 2020",5, Best app for musicians hands down. Super easy to use and super useful. I've been using ultimate guitar to learn since 2000 and there is none better.
405,Jimmy Edgell,"April 10, 2020",5, So impressed. It's been about 5 years since I last used ultimate guitar (picking guitar back up again) and wow it's come in a journey! Well done all involved
406,Saylor Chidester,"April 11, 2020",5, The pro features are absolutely worth the $1.60 a month. You can play any song under the sun in the most convenient way possible. Easy to read and follow
407,Matt Haire,"April 14, 2020",1, This was a great app. Had it for a while. Loved it. Until they took away the Listen option on each tab... Not sure why. Disappointing.
408,Maia Roberts,"April 20, 2020",5, It's so helpful with such great content and I love being able to see other users content!
409,fiona Coombes,"February 2, 2020",5, It's great to find songs with chords suitable to my ability. A massive range of songs and genres. Easy to navigate and plenty of help and tips available.
410,Dallas Hansen,"February 16, 2020",5," This app helps me keep track of songs I have learned or want to learn and it works great! I love this app :) Big thank you to all the devs who worked on this, top notch stuff."
411,Zydny Akazio,"February 15, 2020",5," I can freely browse tabs and chords that I wanted to learn for entertainment or practice purposes. Keep the library updated, add more tabs/chords and keep improving. Thank you for the experience."
412,Everett Walters,"February 23, 2020",5, This is the best guitar app I have ever used! It helps alot when I want to learn new songs! And i am starting to try even harder songs so thank you to whoever made this app it really helps!
413,Logan Conway,"March 4, 2020",1, So once upon a time this was the best place to find guitar tabs for free. Then you had to pay a one time fee in ordee to use their service..... Now i need a subscription!? What happened to my original payment? Is that agreement no longer valid? Then return my money!
414,Lyndon Swanson,"March 19, 2020",5," This app has significantly helped me to learn songs that are usually outside of my area. I love the accessibilities it has along with the different interpretations it can provide for each user. By far, the best guitar tab app on the store!"
415,Karen Wills,"March 20, 2020",3," it's okay. it does it's job but the premium is really annoying, i cant even view the only guitar tab the song i wanna learn has because it's only available to the ppl who buy whatever. i didnt like how i had to download the app to make the online version i was using easier either."
416,Catherine Holgate,"March 24, 2020",5," Love UG, my go to for learning songs on the guitar. UG has opened up a whole new world of music that I had no ability to access because of my own lack of skills. UG has given me confidence and allowed me to believe in myself so I can play adequately. Music is my happy place, UG is the key."
417,Zachary Spenner,"April 8, 2020",5, I know how hard it is to get Spotify to partner their services with other companies so good on you guys for achieving that! Best tabs app around and at $20/year I think that's a deal too good to pass up
418,Jordan Nicholl,"April 9, 2020",2," Good for chords and stuff, it's unfortunate that it keeps on crashing whenever I'm in the middle of learning a song."
419,Gary Lorking,"April 17, 2020",5," The besf out there, I have never failed to find the song/music I want. The key transpose facility is magic. Thankyou to all of the contributors out there."
420,IRON LORD,"April 21, 2020",2, Horrible App I can only understand tab music and I have to pay to read any tab music yet I'm allowed to view chord sheets Not good App for beginners Definitely will not be recommending to anyone
421,Sejin Kim,"February 12, 2020",5, Great app for guitarists of any level! It's easy to see and transpose chords instantly and has tabs for almost any song. Will recommend to anyone who would like to play the guitar :)
422,Sammy Walterova,"February 12, 2020",1," So many ads, as was said, anything you would like to use in this app is for money- you have to pay for 'premium' for everything! app for ""free"".. yea, sure:)))"
423,Johann Ko,"February 21, 2020",1, This has to be the worst app i've ever used. You might as well google tabs because this will kill your battery and it'll show you ads. Crashes a lot too. Terrible from every aspect.
424,x key,"February 29, 2020",4, All around great app but there are some thing that I dont understand like why I have to pay to learn certain songs but thanks to all of the developers and comunity for making this app Great. Also here's another star *
425,Héctor Pérez,"March 4, 2020",5," Awesome app. I was searching for Nick Drake chords and i found awesome tabs. There are some issues in Android regarding the special characters like ""á à ä"" in Spanish, French and Brazilian music. But is almost irrelevant."
426,conor temple,"March 17, 2020",1," Large amount of content but very few features included. Ug have worked for years to give you less make the app frustrating with pop ups, limited zoom and reducing features in general to increase subscription sales."
427,Charles Haugen,"March 25, 2020",5," I, along with others requested a song for transcribing... And once again you've come through - plays great! Tons of variety in songs and more added each day! Way to go!"
428,Trampas Carns,"March 31, 2020",5, Its really awsome how well the songs are put together. Veraesa.and chours laid out perfecy. Tempo and tunning of your guitar. I truly feel this app will accommodate every level of musician out there in the world.
429,Enrique Perez,"April 4, 2020",5," Even with the Ads, I've had a great experience! It has improved my playing despite me being a beginner."
430,Nathan Conley,"April 23, 2020",1, So dumb you have to download app to see chord formations. Makes me not care to learn what I'm trying to learn. Used to be able to see everything I needed back in the day. Thanks for forcing me to do it your way.
431,Marty Mayfield,"April 25, 2020",5, Amazing app. Im always finding new features to play with. It litterally trippled my covers list size. You have to try it if you play.
432,Bhaskar Ganguly,"March 19, 2020",5," This is an absolute must-have for all types of guitarists. The playlist is huge and really helpful. Boasts a wide number of other features like Shots, Metronomes, Chromatic Tunes, Chord Library etc. This is an app you should pay for."
433,Droghne,"March 19, 2020",5," It's a very good app if you're looking the tabs or chords for a song and other added features as well are neat, of course it doesn't have every song out there but you would be surprised of how much it does. Very nice 👌🏽"
434,Nigel Churchill,"March 7, 2020",5," great learning tool, it let's me learn all my favorite songs and there is no number of times I can try it again. It's worth the money, effort, wait, and for that first time you nail a tough riff."
435,Mark Zalenski,"February 5, 2020",5, This allows me to make a lot of progress on my guitar journey. I play left-handed and upside down so all of the chord variations come in handy by allowing me to see which voicings work for my stylei
436,Brian Ledet,"February 9, 2020",5," I like to learn most things by ear. However, Sometimes I'm in a crunch to learn an abundance of songs in a short time. This app is very handy for doing just that."
437,Stacy S,"February 13, 2020",5, The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to transpose the tabs to another tuning. I'm tuned to C standard and a lot of the songs I want to play are in E and D.
438,Sean Stewart,"February 16, 2020",5, Great app! I learn alot with tabs and chord sheets and I can find most everything I'm looking for. The built in chord book is also super useful if you happen to see a chord you dont recognize!!
439,er1ck_d_0r1g1nal,"March 7, 2020",5," I had fun, sometimes it may not sound right for different types of chords, but there's always a second option, even a third, 5/5 would recommend. (CAUTION: Contains Ads!)"
440,TW Degroot,"February 2, 2020",5," Lots of great old folk songs that are hard to find elsewhere. Pro tabs are so accurate. Thumbs up for having Woody Guthrie Leadbelly, Jimmie Rodgers and many more of the greats"
441,Quastafa !!!,"February 19, 2020",4," It's good without the premium, but personally I would like to eventually buy it. I just don't have the time to use the app and learning a new instrument can be a bit confusing ."
442,Mandi Earhart,"February 23, 2020",3," It is pretty slow. It has a lot of premium features, if they took things like transposing a song off of premium I would give it five stars."
443,Damian Parsons,"March 1, 2020",3, So bizarre you have to hit back 8 million times to get back to the search bar when you're already in a song. There needs to be either a search button right there or a home button.
444,Michael Gerlach,"March 7, 2020",5," Absolutely love this app. Great for either learning the song, damn near any song, and once you learn the song you can shut everything off except the bass and drums and play along. Really cool app very worth the money!"
445,Eli Maagic,"March 21, 2020",5, Probably the best... If there's a BETTER guitar tab app... Or website I have NOT found it. Ultimate Guitar Tabs is a MONSTER.. AND I LOVE IT ☺️ Thank you UG Team!! Keep rocking everyone and download UG if you're trying to learn how to play more songs/music!!
446,Tyler Ballard,"March 25, 2020",5," I've been subscribed to these guys for almost a decade and ive started and stopped using the app and website numorous times and they still send deals and sales, and save everything attatched to my account. Perfect for any guitarest"
447,Marai22 B.,"March 30, 2020",5, I've never had a miss looking for songs to practice on and the chords are not basic to begin with. Cheers to Ultimate guitar! You make me sound like a pro!
448,Gopalakrishnan Nagasundram,"April 4, 2020",4, Nice app Really helpful to play songs on guitar. The only problem is that it keeps asking money to access the tuner and other tools.
449,Black Dawn,"April 10, 2020",1," Very disappointed you have to pay money just to view or interact with the tools and others, big waste of time. Also I wouldn't even rate 1 star if I didn't have to."
450,Tifany Lee,"April 17, 2020",5, I love this app. I got the paid version and it changed everything. Transpose it's a huge Library so I can serve my student with their huge variety of tastes
451,Shawn,"April 16, 2020",5, I'm diggin this app. Bought the pro version and unlocked the features which keep me engaged on my guitar longer than what usually holds my attention.
452,Barry Henson,"April 22, 2020",1," Website ""Download our app! Download our app! App ""Pay for premium! Pay for premium!"" Me.... Uninstalled"
453,Daniel Orji,"April 18, 2020",5, I started only knowing a few cords and a day later I'm playing 3minute songs such as perfect
454,The dog that saw you naked,"February 2, 2020",5," Love the app. Still some bugs, but overall my favorite app for tabs! If you are a musician and you dont already have this app, I definitely recommend you download."
455,Chris Gould,"February 9, 2020",2, Just a constant barrage of full page ads to upgrade and if you don't upgrade you get constant full page ads and can only see a small fraction of the content.
456,Cory Alexander,"February 8, 2020",5, Large cataloge. Many varients with official version. Ability to mute some or all instraments to hear what you need to. Linked to YouTube of the song. They thought of most everything.
457,Bil Amerson,"February 14, 2020",4," Love it, but I wish it would stop forcing me into the app when I want it in my browser. You can't print to PDF from the app. Otherwise, a good app"
458,Patrick Satter,"February 19, 2020",5, Great amp to find what you need. Lesser known songs you'll have to play what's there in the tab and maybe tweak it a bit. Great for beginners
459,Josh Burchette,"February 23, 2020",5," Great way to find new material! Lots of great tools, videos, the forum is great. Just way too much to list. It's an everyday tool for me!"
460,Ashley Peterson,"February 29, 2020",5, Love this app and ability to favorite songs and print as needed. Makes it easy when you hear a song on the radio and dont want to forget it later.
461,Shubham paul,"March 15, 2020",5, To be honest this the first time I am using this kind of application and the experience was good easy to navigate can find lots of songs in its library. Well I should go and learn some more songs. Chao.
462,Ben Fuson,"March 16, 2020",2, Full of ads and constantly wants you to pay to have features that are free if you use a computer. Only good thing is the songs fit the phone screen better.
463,bwi_ ggukie,"April 5, 2020",5," its very useful and nice. though theres some songs that you need to pay, but its still useful for everyone, even without the premium"
464,Juan Manuel Millán,"April 12, 2020",4, This app is just great. I give only 4 stars because I don't understand why autoscroll is only for premium users when you can use it in the web version.
465,Qtaro Kujo,"April 15, 2020",1, Horrible! Full of ads and works very slow...
466,Steve Ward,"February 3, 2020",5, It took a little time to explore the app and find all that it has to offer but now i find myself on it all the time. By for one if my most used apps. Highly recommended!
467,Christian Hansen,"February 5, 2020",3," Not being a guitar expert, I can't really comment on the accuracy of the Tabs. But overall I like the way this app is presented and it seems to work well."
468,Brian YellowEyes,"February 8, 2020",5," As any site that allows public publishing, find the one that works best for the individual and enjoy. Thank you for Ultimate Guitar!"
469,Ryan & Miah Carbonel,"February 15, 2020",5," It's great for me as a musician, it's helpful when I need to look up a song or find something to play. Over all it's a great app and I highly suggest musicians to use it"
470,Denny Cho,"February 23, 2020",5," Lots of great chords and tabs. It's the ULTIMATE!!!!! Phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop friendly---->easy to print! If you lose your sheet music, you can reprint or just use your CPU device!!!!!"
471,Joseph Myers,"February 21, 2020",5, Best app. If you pay. But you get your money's worth out of it after a few songs! Highly recommended for the beginners novice and rockstar alike
472,Lucy Fielder,"February 21, 2020",5," Phenomenol!! Love it. Best App ever. I've improved immensely and have always found the song I seek... Even the most random are there!! Thank you, you are amazing developers :) x"
473,Canadian Cyanide,"February 24, 2020",4," Mostly useful. Some of the tabs are a bit iffy or just plain wrong but most are correct and for the decent annual premium cost of around 10 bucks, I'd say its mostly worth it."
474,Phillip Fry,"February 27, 2020",5," I had to change my rating. The problem I had was fixed. I really do like this app. I have ultimate guitar for years, so having a phone app makes it even easier."
475,disable 956,"March 20, 2020",5," Amazing! I subscribed to them, and it's amazing. I've used it for 2 years (I think) and have learned a lot on it. 111/10 best guitar/piano/any stringed instrement app ever."
476,Joe Baloga,"March 24, 2020",1, This app is overpriced and not good for a wide range of players(especially bass players). Songsterr is way better for the money in every way.
477,Doom Food,"March 29, 2020",5," For a semi beginner left hander, I found the right handedness of the app mildly frustrating, then I discovered left handed mode and everything is peachy keen. Tab play along feature is great."
478,Jason Miller,"March 31, 2020",5," It is a very good ap that taught me how to play my favorit songs on my guitar, i live in the country in northern albert and at a really great place and i love to play the guitar so this app is perfect for me"
479,Aaron Hadley,"April 6, 2020",5," Always love having this gem of an app in my back pocket . Years going and it has just gotten better . Thanks developers, keep kicking ass and taking tabs ."
480,Nick Donaldson,"April 13, 2020",5, Good content that is easy to navigate and lots of talented people with a common love of guitar!!!
481,Sexy King Phil,"April 17, 2020",5," I've been using this app ever since I was like 13, and I've always had an awesome experience using this app. Five stars for being awesome!"
482,Francis Drouin,"April 19, 2020",1, So many pop ups asking you to subscribe. Very annoying. Desinstalled it
483,Aileen O'Connor,"February 28, 2020",4, Love how this app has grown and developed over time. Update: I still love this app but getting tired of how glitchy it is. Even with 4G it freezes all the time.
484,Emma Nieemma,"February 7, 2020",5," Love this app. Most comprehensive collection of chords and tabs on the internet, with a variety of instrument options. Great job, UG!"
485,Daniel Nunez,"February 22, 2020",5, A useful tool to have. Easy to Navigate and user friendly when it comes to difficulty levels offering ranges from novice to expert.
486,Maly Lim,"February 23, 2020",5," Great guitar app! Has tabs, chords and videos you can learn from. Has multiple version of many songs. Been using the website for years and the app doesn't disappoint."
487,von catz,"March 28, 2020",5, But this app crashed after the update just after I paid a premium. It hurts so bad... Edited: I reinstalled and it performed better. Thank you for the recommendation.
488,Matthew Claus,"March 22, 2020",3, It crashes alot. Both android and ios. I find when i try to use the tabs along with the pedal tone it crashes almost every time. Glad i can make my own tones on my pod and axe fx lol.
489,Elliott Townsend,"March 25, 2020",2," Obnoxious, unskippable notifications all the time. Poor search function. The vast database makes it essential but damn I wish it was cleaner. Especially since I have the pro version."
490,Gary Mace,"March 29, 2020",1, Forced to subscribed before I can even try it?? Uh... no. That ain't happening. Uninstalling and trying something else. I do subscribe to good apps... but it has to prove itself first. Bye
491,Nick Bogardus,"April 1, 2020",1, The app is annoying to use and is full of ads. Also a lot of the tabs/chords are not accurate.
492,Tommy Davis,"April 5, 2020",5," Very handy, user-friendly app that is ready, willing & able to step-up your guitar skills!"
493,Katie Kinsey,"April 6, 2020",5," We love this app, it's great for learning guitar chords, keyboard notes, lyrics and for jamming in general!"
494,Sandra Roberts,"April 26, 2020",5, I'm not into the social media aspects and find some of the new features a little confusing. But still the best guitar chord app
495,Reminiscent Melody,"April 23, 2020",5," If you get pro, which is pretty cheap so woth it simply bc of the autoscroll alone not to mention all the other cool stuff you get. Best tabs app on the market for sure"
496,Matt Lee,"April 22, 2020",1, Useless unless u pay for it As usual with any of these apps Wanted to learn a certain song but wouldnt stop harassing me about paying for full version I don't pay for apps when a long time ago this was all free If ur a free app kinda person Don't bother installing it cuz u will not get anywhere Did ...Full ReviewUseless unless u pay for it As usual with any of these apps Wanted to learn a certain song but wouldnt stop harassing me about paying for full version I don't pay for apps when a long time ago this was all free If ur a free app kinda person Don't bother installing it cuz u will not get anywhere Did nothing but waste my time
497,Trevor McAlister,"April 27, 2020",5, Brills...just everything you need and the community give you encouragement. Great app
498,Jakob Stolzenfels,"February 3, 2020",5, This app is the best way to hang and play with friends. No worries what is right or wrong - just a reference for some help playing your favorite tunes.
499,Stephanie Brown,"February 5, 2020",5, So many songs. I play piano but use this just for the chords to popular songs. Its great fun to just jam with friends using chords just for a good time.
500,Andy Fisher,"March 4, 2020",5, Very helpful with nice little touches like a tuner built into the app. I'm only a beginner and find it helpful. 5 out of 5 from me.
501,Robert Cantrell,"March 6, 2020",5, The regular app was very instrumental in playing better. The pro version allows me to dial in and become a better guitar player and musician. Thanks a lot! Great app! 🎸
502,Victor Stroe,"March 15, 2020",1, It's nothing free in this app. Pushes the subscription at every click you make. Sorry but I won't buy the app just for a song. Oh... And ads... They're just everywhere.
503,Daniel Powers,"March 20, 2020",4," As an indecisive musician who cant possible choose a favorite instrument, I appreciate the ability to search through multiple instruments. Learning new songs is a great way to pass the time!"
504,Bill Borden,"March 22, 2020",2," Deceptively looks like a free app but its not. Its s 7 day free trial requiring a credit card before you can use the app. If you forget to cancel in 7 days, you bought it."
505,Mister Mister,"March 19, 2020",1, Once you chose an instrument you cant change it its a waist of time unless you pay for it you can't even tune it without paying for it and its expensive theirs no lessons or anything hardly any of the songs are even accurate dont waist yor time on it
506,Trevor Schroeder,"March 23, 2020",5," There's almost always a tab for the song you're looking for, and they're actually very helpful. It tells you the key, and gives different versions for the song."
507,A Fabulous Killjoy,"April 9, 2020",5, This app is very helpful and I love being able to see other artists who like the same music as me and discovering new music because of them.
508,Adam Latronic,"April 23, 2020",5," It feels great to play the songs you love. It's comes to life a different way, when you yourself plays it."
509,Celine Tran,"April 13, 2020",1," Great potential but always crashes and whenever I click on a tab it would say ""error, timed out"" which is very frustrating"
510,cassius me,"February 8, 2020",5, This app stays on my device. Ive played 19 years i can play well over a few hundred songs by heart now. I only use this app unless the occassional inability to seek a song 5 stars and perfect
511,micaymi,"February 3, 2020",1," Paid for the subscription and find out that the app is so laggy. It even takes a long time to load the home screen. What am I paying for, really???"
512,Artem Kashtanov,"February 6, 2020",5," This is a hell of an app! All chords for all songs with tabs, controlled scrolling, advanced tuner with presets... Etc etc Yes it costs money, like emm 1.5 per month 🤨? Rip off, yeah..."

515,Sean Bracken,"February 24, 2020",4, A little clunky on the Surface. Don't like how you have to scroll it in portrait mode. Love everything else about it though!
516,Jon Maskill,"March 4, 2020",1, Utter rubbish. Advert after advert. Pop up central. Very few areas of the screen can be touched without leaving the site to go to some garbage. What a shame
517,Ever So Mellow or Representative,"March 6, 2020",5, Easily the best source for an expansive library of tunes to pick from and its basically a must have for the workin musician or artist who wants continually grow by learning new songs. Its my favorite way to practice.
518,JASON KENNEDYWALE,"March 12, 2020",5, Great app!! Been playing 30 years and I use this all the time...Great choice of tabs and just so many songs and artists!! Well worth buying..
519,Laxa Family,"March 16, 2020",5," Its okay. It's just that the suggested personalization option is not broad. It does not include jazz, r&b, neo-soul,- some of the most essential genres when learning guitar."
520,Michael Meme,"March 22, 2020",5," Been using this app for coming up on 5 years. Quality tabs are in great supply, more being uploaded all the time. Gotta say the pro tabs are worth it. The social aspect of the app is also well designed if a touch under used."
521,David Watkeys,"April 6, 2020",5, It's pretty helpful tabs all over the place. I'm enjoying that there is more ukulele content than before.
522,Suzanne Ash,"April 4, 2020",4, Need a little more explanation of how to obtain sort and categorize music i want to play. Its confusing...but great song choices and music renditions
523,Brandon Egley,"April 9, 2020",3," A few years ago I bought the app for $1.99 and now I redownload it and it says I need to pay for premium when I bought the app before there was this premium thing. Ultimate Guitar, how can I get my premium feature I paid for already?"
524,Rufeena Mae,"April 9, 2020",1," I think this app is bugged. I clicked on some link but somehow a pop-up with ""Timeout"" always appears then the app closes. Please fix this."
525,Christopher Henwood,"April 27, 2020",5, Excellent app making massive progress in just a few days
526,A Google user,"March 24, 2020",3," I thought it was because my phone's memory was full, but apparently this app is also sluggish on another phone with way more space. Please, fix your app and make it run better."
527,chris o'donohoe,"February 6, 2020",5, Great app and worth getting the pro version. Loads of current tabs and well layed out screen. Its great for party's and impromptu time when you can remember the chords!

530,Reuben Case,"March 2, 2020",5," Great for piano guitar or any instruments you want lyrics and chords for. I use it for piano and guitar, both chord and tab and it is by far the best app/side you can find 5/5"

536,Михаил Звинчук,"April 21, 2020",1, Instead of tabs this app gives tabs. It just doesn't do what it says it does.
537,Vorpal Ocelot,"March 10, 2020",5," Great App, love it. You can slow phrases and create loops to master hard phrases among other great tools. This app does, however, crash often on my Galaxy S8. Cannot recommend a better app for my students."
538,aric wellman,"February 19, 2020",5, Ultimate Guitar is a great app for all my tabs. There are many versions of songs and that helps to play at different levels.
539,mustafa ahmed,"February 23, 2020",5, I really love the app. Very very user friendly.. but if I may.. can you add an option to increase scroll speed up to 3 so we can choose the desired speed.. thumbs up
540,Nicole Crumbaker,"March 21, 2020",4," Love the app only thing is that, on samsung at least, there are some annoying bugs like my profile picture not changing easily or not loading a video from my camera roll to post. Otherwise super friendly and great to help learn"

552,Paul Scott,"February 20, 2020",1," This app is garbage. All songs I want to Tab are ""pro"" pay for it when I can go to Google and find 10 free accurate versions. For example, All of My Love by Led Zeppelin."

562,Donna Helmig,"March 8, 2020",5," It's my go to app for finding chords. Since I'm a beginner, I can't always play all the chords. It's fun to pull this out around the bonfire, and try some new songs."

Do you want to pay money for an app that has less features than the free web version (transpose & CHORD VARIATIONS)? Well boy howdy is this app for you! God help you if you don't subscribe to their racket because you are in for a miserable app experience that forces you to wade through endless ads every time you open the app. Want to just look at a tab?

Lately they've added a lot of features. I finally just broke down and bought a year subscription. I had no idea it was gonna come with so many perks. I thought it would just take the ads away but no, there's a whole other side of ultimate guitar I've been missing out on. Look, just buy the subscription right now. It's only 15 bucks. You'll be glad you did. It's more than worth it. Thank me later."

1359,Beau Solley,"February 10, 2020",4," Great experience. Just hope you have addressed the way on a lot of songs, the chord changes are not located over the words, where the changes are to be made. Love the app, though. Especially being able to watch others progress."

1363,madman 0805,"April 22, 2020",4, This app is very helpful for finding the chords and tabs to almost every song. The only bad thing about it is to get full access to the app you have to buy a membership but the membership is pretty cheap

1365,Cold Jupiter,"February 23, 2020",4, I think it's a pretty cool app. The only thing I find a little Annoying is whenever I try to check online and it keeps asking me to go to the app. Sometimes it'll easy app. Sometimes I just want to get online and just look up real quick

1412,Chris Cheung,"February 2, 2020",5, In this update you can publish tabs. This just adds to the value to an already awesome app. I've been using the UG website for years. The site with the smart phone app is a must for any self taught guitar player.

Wouldn't recommend buying it at this point, especially since they will still bombard you with offers to upgrade which will no doubt do nothing to resolve the issues I mentioned above. Disappointing."

I'll stick to the web; you don't own rights to all free tabs and I won't help you gain them. Uninstalled."

1624,Poo Smith,"November 30, 2019",1," This app used to be good. I even paid a one-time fee to get rid of the ads. Then I got a new phone and forgot my account info, but everything was accessible as long as I could sit through ads. Now premium is a monthly subscription and features are behind a paywall. This is a useless app."
1625,Bill P,"December 24, 2019",4, You buy it but then it asks fo more money and sends notifications about how you can buy more features. That said it's a great app for finding tabs and I guess a lot of the features they charge for seem worth it. I've been using this app and the sight for a long time and dont plan on stopping.
1626,CronDog,"February 2, 2020",4," The only thing that confuses me is the strumming, I can't read it like the chords or lyrics. Great app tho learned how to do two songs but got the strumming from youtube."
1627,Nynra,"February 5, 2020",2, Such a big app yet so laggy. Why can't you even optimize it? The start time is too long. The list gets frozen. And selecting and viewing a song is laggy too.

1705,Just A Weaboo,"December 4, 2019",1," Ok so I was learning on how to play Let Her Go on the web page, and I downloaded the app. Now I've already searched up the the piece and guess what, an ad from you to tell us about the premium services to offer. So I go and leave the add and then the piece just closes it self."
1706,Dovahkiin Lumar,"December 9, 2019",4, This is a great app and I highly recommend it for all levels of players. Lots of great tools and tabs. The recent update however has removed a lot of icons making the app almost impossible to navigate. This is the only issue I have ever had with the app and I still highly recommend it.
1707,Crazed Tamang,"December 10, 2019",5," It is nice and easy. The music videos helps a lot while learning to play. However, I have a problem with this app. It is lacking songs by Cavetown. It would be great if your team were to add some more songs by Cavetown."
1708,Jacob Pickle,"December 23, 2019",2," I think this app really needs an update. The interface is clunky, there's not that much you can do in settings you cant change guitar tunings and the tones are all terrible. I pay 20 a year for the subscription where is the money going?"
1709,GRIMY,"January 3, 2020",5, This app has helped me for years. I love how they've made it available acrossultiple devices (recently learned that). I've been a beginner player for 6 years and I can still learn at my own pace. Best app I've ever bought hands-down
1710,Kirsten Miller,"January 4, 2020",1, The app itself is fine and has dome useful features but do NOT sign up to pro! It seems to be a licence for them to take money out of your bank account and then just not answer your email questions! Their lifetime membership is no exception. Really disgraceful!
1711,terri sterniday,"January 22, 2020",5," No regrets; this app is well worth buying the premium subscription. The metronome is terrific, and the chord dictionary is addictive. There's so much to learn and explore here. It's become my favorite app on my tablet and an essential music tool."
1712,Cam DLR,"January 24, 2020",5," Damn good app and service, given the small price tag - built in midi playback can be hit and miss depending on what other users have submitted, but often you'll find really realistic renditions for even the most obscure guitar riffs you've dreamed of.

Strong recommend given all the other learning functions pro comes with!"
1713,Grace Majesty,"January 29, 2020",5," Purchased the app over a year ago and they had changed it since then to a subscription for pro, and I had changed phones. However after writing a review I learned I could get pro because i bought it back then. They have a great selection of tabs! And autoscroll is really nice."
1714,Ruthann Grace,"February 7, 2020",5, Most tabs are very true to the songs
1715,Derik Mittag,"February 8, 2020",5, Easy for learning songs on the fly
1716,WOW ilikebeans,"February 14, 2020",5, From the time I opened this app I was a complete beginner but this app show me a chords I needed to play any song their song library is massive from modern to classical music it has it all!
1717,Gerard Guckin,"February 28, 2020",1, I did not order the app and I was charged for a year. I was thinking about signing up but now no one will respond or refund my money. It's a shame because it appears to be a good one.
1718,Master of Zen,"March 2, 2020",5, For being free get a decent selection.
1719,G Bowlr,"March 8, 2020",5, Great app with sample of the song and you can change the chords higher or lower key. Perfect for performing on house parties or small venues.
1720,William J. Moner,"April 1, 2020",5," The exclusive Wonderwall collection is, after all, the one that saved me. I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now."

Good for begginers of all ages. Love the fact it plays while you read the chords! now if you could make it stop freezing and closing out in the middle of a song would be great. real embarrasing when trying to play for people and the app just shuts down then dont want to play again. i paid for a year membership and im beggining to regret it.
1722,Ellen Ortiz,"January 28, 2020",4," I love this app. I remember in my younger years sitting with a tape recorder to get the music off the radio and then playing it over and over again trying to learn the lyrics, trying to figure the chord progression. This just makes my life happy! :)"
1723,angela ealden,"November 11, 2019",5," I wish I installed this app sooner, its not only a platform for learning but also for sharing what you've learned. It doesn't matter if you're a novice looking for direction or an expert looking to show off your skills, this app has alot to offer."
1724,Brenden,"November 22, 2019",1," This app is horrible. I used to be able to simply get chords to a song I wanted to play. Now it's slow as hell and asks you a bunch of stupid questions to ""personalize"" the app. Great idea: piss off your users right at the get-go with a bunch of irrelevant questions they never wanted to answer."
1725,Aaron G,"November 25, 2019",5," I've used the website for many years, and having it all in an app form is awesome! Everything I knew I could always use for help with music and music questions, wrapped in a smaller form and a bigger bang. Nice job Ultimate Guitar, nice job!"
1726,Luke Wilson,"December 8, 2019",1, This app destroys my battery. I don't care if you give me ads but when I have what should be a super simple page open with some tabs it shouldn't drain my battery faster than any webpage I have ever visited. I could literally watch movies and waste less battery then this app does.
1727,Michael Justice,"December 5, 2019",5," I love the variable speed options in the tabs, it allows you to learn at your own pace and it's only like $15 for an unlimited wealth of tutorials and tablatures for every part in any song, with options for transposing keys and even a tuner!"
1728,Jay Kelly,"December 15, 2019",3, This is a good app except that I would really like them to make the auto scroll maximum speed even faster--- too slow for some songs. Also on my tablet I noticed that it doesn't refresh my playlist. I have to close the app and reopen it together refreshed list
1729,Stan Schrama,"December 20, 2019",5," The app, as well as the site are a very useful tool for the beginner musician. The ability to view multiple versions and communicate with other musicians creates an environment that gives every member the chance to grow and contribute to the site."
1730,James Sanders,"December 20, 2019",1, Used to use this app a lot a while ago and had paid for the full version. I have recently reinstalled it using the same Google play account and now the features I had previously paid for are now paywalled by a monthly subscription. Kinda feel like I want my money back now...

Apparently there are different versions of some songs, errors in the sheets or songs just with tabs/chords/notes. Would get 5 stars, if the incorrect versions would get deleted and the incomplete versions would be worked over so they have all three (tabs, chords an notes). The autoscroll option needs a work-over, too. It's hardly impossible to find a speed according to the bpm."
1732,Amber McKinney,"December 29, 2019",1," I've been a long-time user (about 10 years now) and the website has steadily gone downhill, freezing or loading badly. Thought maybe the app would be better, but it is equally poor in design and ability to even load tabs or basic chords. Very, very dissatisfied and disappointed."
1733,Bill Young,"December 26, 2019",5, Love this app. It helps me in every way to get to something I can play well enough to enjoy without being discouraged. That's important to me. It has worked flawlessly (Android). And being able to print out a whole song is brilliant
1734,Andrés Forero,"January 11, 2020",5," I love this app! It has my guitar practicing really easy and convenient. I can find everything in one place (tuner, tabs, covers, social media, videos on how to play certain songs), it's awesome!"
1735,Matt Sowinski,"January 9, 2020",1," You can't even use the app. Anything you click on or search brings up a paywall asking you to pay 20$ for the ""pro"" version of the app. An absolute scam. Don't get tricked by this ""free"" app, all it does is let you search songs and then begs for your money instead of showing you the tabs."

1739,Martin Ječmínek,"December 8, 2019",5," I loved the app but after factory reset it is impossible to use. During the initial setup a popup with rating is displayed and it cannot be removed or controlled. It is just stuck there, but the layer underneath reacts to touch."
1740,Casey Bayless,"January 1, 2020",5," By far the best guitar app out there. It is super easy to use, and has so many usefull features. Now I can play a lot of my favorite songs with no problem and have the exact chords. And if you are hesitant to get pro, do it. Its an amazing app. 5 stars for sure."
1741,nicholas shink,"November 7, 2019",5, Been using this app a while now and I'm always able to find what I'm looking for no matter what it is. Tabs seem accurately ranked and there are almost always several types or versions of songs such as tab or chord. Definitely has way more to offer then what I use it for.

One day when the rockstar within me blossoms I'm giving a shout out to them at every show in the spirit of rockstarness. By taking care of their people I mean they listen to their customers requests and are always changing little things here and there to make it more user friendly and still have hella hella content.
1743,David Morehouse,"November 18, 2019",5," Easy to use! I just started playing guitar a few months ago for a class and I love it. This app makes it so I can play my favorite songs super easily, and theres no mumbo jumbo about it either! It's pure awesomeness!"
1744,Ted Mitchell,"November 23, 2019",5," Pretty great app and constantly getting better. I like that they are always trying to figure out new, helpful tools. IMO this app is worth it. From beginners serious about learning to advanced playing, it is the best tool I've used in a long time of playing."
1745,Matthew Vittetoe,"December 6, 2019",1, The pro tabs used to scroll but don't anymore. The red cursor just moves until it goes onto off the screen onto the next line. It makes it impossible to see what's next. Literally makes the entire thing unusable UPDATE: the app is still broken after the update
1746,Allison Chambers,"December 17, 2019",2," Stalls and crashes. And I bought the pro version! Also, if I'm navigating on my browser to search for a song (because that works better!) and I hit the ""open in app"" button, it goes to the Play Store, not the app."

1749,Simon Jocelyn,"December 21, 2019",5," It's a really great app for musicians of all abilities. Constantly evolving to strive to be better and not elitist in the slightest. Whatever your skill level, beginner or pro, you are welcomed and encouraged and I think it's one of the best apps of the decade. Just awesome guys.!!"
1750,Joe Troutt,"December 29, 2019",1, Do not install this app. Makes you agree to a free trial pro account which is 19.99 but doesn't notify you before it charges your account if you want to cancel. Its not really that great. You can search the web for the same exact info for free.
1751,Jay Howard,"January 18, 2020",3," It's okay, but not the best (and maybe glitchy?). For instance, when i click ""my tabs"", only one of the tabs I've made appears. If i search my other ones, i'm able to view them, edit them, etc., but it's a little frustrating in that regard."
1752,Samshul Amry,"March 21, 2020",4," Great. But i'd love to be able to do a quick search after one tab. In current format, i had to press back numerous time Thanks"
1753,Robert Hendrix,"January 21, 2020",5," Great app! Have used it for years, gets better and better every update! I would recommend this app to any and everyone either interested in playing an instrument. Or if your a expert or been playing for quite some time this app is perfect to keep learning. Give it a try!"

As for app itself, it's an awesome tool to have for learning and improving. Tons of resources and features. Well worth the lifetime membership."
1761,Clark Lofranco,"December 10, 2019",1," So slow. Before it's free and now it's pay to use.. I know you need money but please make the app usable for us poor. In addition to these, your app has too many ads.. That it suddenly pop out while I'm singing. It's very annoying"
1762,Everett post,"November 15, 2019",5," This is definently a great app for learning guitar, picking up songs to play and reading tablature. I got the pro version and for $12.00 a year it's definitely worth it. Thank you for creating such a great app!"
1763,N / A,"November 25, 2019",5, Amazing app. I purchased years ago a lifetime subscription when it was much cheaper... Since then the site has transformed and become so much more than I ever imagined. They never charged me any additional money.
1764,Tyler Gilbert,"November 28, 2019",1, It used to be a great app until the marketeers got their hands on it. Now you can't hardly look up a song without 3 million prompts to pay money. And their users do all the tab/chord work anyway. Just use the PC site with Adblocker and let this god awful app go.
1765,Eliza T,"December 1, 2019",5," I love how this app makes learning more adaptable and fun. It has some really cool features, including offline use of saved tabs. I totally recommend this app for anyone wanting to learn to play, or learn specific songs!😊"
1766,Leo G,"January 10, 2020",4," Eve though there are great tabs, ads are too intrusive. They slow down the app, sometimes hide the content and cannot be closed and appear out of nowhere randomly shifting the content so you have to stop singing to find out where you where before the ad popped up"
1767,Marc Hartsing,"December 19, 2019",5, The private shots thing may be just what I need to gain confidence in myself. Thanks! I can never get over hearing my voice recorded. Always felt subpar. This may help me tweak up my sound to be more tolerable.
1768,Alex Langan,"December 30, 2019",1, Free version of the app is less usable than a plain text file on my phone. That's not even counting the unending barrage of ads. Edit: that is because your mobile page is designed to be intentionally unusable so people pay for your app. Why is app listed as free if it is unusable as a free app?
1769,FarmerHoggit,"December 29, 2019",1, This is probably the most horrible app I've ever tried to use. It feels as if they are actively trying to prevent you from doing what you want to do. Advertisements pop up constantly and when you finally get to a tab you want to look at the app is liable to crash soon afterwards.

1773,Jesse Archey,"January 8, 2020",5," Ive enjoyed this app immensly (im a musician, not a linguist). I love that i can find the songs that i want to learn and theres even versions that show me what its supposed to sound like. Worth the cost (like 5 bucks or something) to get premium."
1774,Dan L,"January 8, 2020",4," Great app, has tuner, has youtube feature built in, so you can press one button and it brings up the actual song on youtube, so you can go back and forth between practicing and comparing to actual if you want. I wish it had tabulature, too."
1775,Ty Flowshun,"January 23, 2020",5, A lot of personal transposition goes into making chords and tabs for the songs you love on this site based app. I just wanted to say thanks to those dedicated people who make them. Thanks to the chief developer as well for making this possible.
1776,James Jernigan,"January 24, 2020",4, Everything is super easy to use. Super used friendly. All you need is to know the name of the song and your instrument of choice. I wish the play back had better sounds haha I guess we can't get too spoiled though.

1803,Rodora Perez,"January 31, 2020",5, UG has developed through the years. Been using it since 2001. This app is easy to use and I love that it is synced with my account when using the PC. The collection of tabs and the UG community is very valuable.
1804,Martin Kunert,"November 23, 2019",5, An excellent app for aspiring guitarists with many thousand tabs of all genres.

Well worth checking out their pro subscription which gives access to their Official Tabs which are usually very accurate. Also their support is exceptional - I had an issue which was immediately sorted out with great communication.
1805,Mike Martyr,"November 18, 2019",3," Awesome app for the most part, some songs aren't available, fireflies by owl city for example. 99% of the tabs I want are on there but it's an expensive app and that nagging 1% of tabs that aren't available really stand out after paying for it."
1806,Blank Slate,"November 14, 2019",4, Useful library of song with pretty good functionality. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact it is really pushy about trying to get you to go premium and it keeps giving me notifications to encourage me to record myself playing
1807,GuitaristGabriel,"November 25, 2019",5," Been part of the UG community for more than 10 years and I gotta say the people are supportive, the tabs are easy to read and if you upgrade to pro, the pro tabs are super intuitive and helpful. All around, would recommend!"
1808,Johnny Ride,"November 26, 2019",5, Love this app!!! This is such an awesome resource and so easy to use. It helps me to keep playing and practicing especially the PRO versions. Thanks folks - you've kept me busy for hundreds of hours.
1809,Cameron Pratt,"December 15, 2019",5, So great to have on hand. Need that missing part of the song you're trying to learn? Usually searchable. Just need to tune up? Metronome? The tools are super handy. Most worthwhile pay app I use. I really appreciate all the work that goes in.
1810,David Fox,"January 6, 2020",5," I'm a beginner so I'm just getting in to playing acoustic. This app seems to be all I'll need once I get the basics. All the songs, chords and strumming patterns. Definitely a good investment for all levels."
1811,Brand,"January 11, 2020",5, This is app great. It help me a lot. When i mean lot i mean a lot. I know got a lot of things nd to give money but the basic version alrdy cover the chords and tab. U don't actually nd full version. For me i don't nd full version cuz its alrdy great.
1812,Luna Lily,"January 14, 2020",1," I have used Ultimate Guitar for over a decade. Now, not only do you want money to push the goddamn 'transpose' button, the app won't even stay open. You've gotten greedy, and it sucks. YOU suck."
1813,okay bruh,"January 18, 2020",5," Looks like there is a lot of good song options, lessons, and helpful tools. I don't really like how much we are limited if we do not have premium. I understand people need to get paid, but we already watch ads."
1814,Joel Engineer,"January 31, 2020",1," NO I don't want to subscribe to your pro edition! Stop asking every other click. So many forced ads! Forced video playback! I just want to play music!

1815,Ben Shephard,"February 1, 2020",5," Just getting back into bass, guitar and drums this app has it all. I showed my son this app and now he plays guitar and bass and loves it."
1816,Eduardo Patino,"November 11, 2019",5, Ultimate guitar has come along way from when I first started using it in high school. Users can now record their jam sessions? Awesome! I can't wait to see how they will continue to bring people together with music next!
1817,Louis Memoli,"November 17, 2019",5," Great app for guitarists. I'm a keyboardist but love the ability to look up most any song (chords and lyrics), transpose as needed, and use it for playing (lead sheet scrolls)! Easier to use than OnSong and works on Androids."
1818,Sage Hudson,"November 17, 2019",5, I like the one time purchase option for pro. I think the app is pretty user friendly and usually has the song I'm looking for. Perfect for a beginner guitar player looking to learn some new songs.
1819,Alan Richard,"November 24, 2019",2, Bugs Bugs Bugs. Now speed isn't working as it should be. When I bought this app it was good. Then something you guys changed and made it worse. How hard can it be to fix silly bugs? It's frustrating 😤.
1820,Jesse Benzing,"November 25, 2019",5," Easy to use. While it has some helpful tools, the paid version is not necessary to learning. I've been teaching myself guitar for 2 years now, and the free version has everything I need. Thank you UG!"
1821,grimsdottir / corpse grinder,"November 25, 2019",3," A lot of ads, the mobile app has some good features but if you're like me and have been playing since the O.G. ultimate guitar then this might not be the best option for you, but its able to work."
1822,Noelle Celusta,"January 2, 2020",2," Constantly crashing, an ""extra feature"" which remains unchanged with a premium account. We've been waiting for the patch since the app launched. At this point it's clear that they have no intention of fixing it."
1823,Blue Flame275,"December 24, 2019",3," This app has bugs on where I try to play the official tab, and it either buzzes or the line won't keep up and keeps going back to the beginning. It never did this until the previous update. Can you guys please fix this? I will not use this app until it's fixed!"
1824,Rory Manning,"December 17, 2019",2," Lots of ads and most buttons lead to a full screen popup for a pro subscription. Guys, at least put an icon on the buttons or something so I know which ones to avoid, it's infuriating trying to do something and *then* being told I have to pay for it."
1825,Luke Medhurst,"December 26, 2019",5, Great resource for guitar tabs. I was recommended it by a friend and love being able to look up different songs. Some of them aren't quite right but gives you a good starting point. Good app and with the Christmas discount it's well worth it for the year.
1826,Lemongrass Tea,"January 11, 2020",5," It's great! Don't have premium, but it's fine and working amazingly, only a couple of ads which is rlly good! Congrats! Edit- I just can't explain how great this app is! It's just like yesss all ye fellow guitar players should defo use this ❤️"
1827,Pope Friction,"December 31, 2019",1, Absolutely terrible. You might as well learn from ear because you cant make it 5 seconds without being coaxed into buying the premium version. It use to be a lot better a few years ago but now it's just a money trap.
1828,Arastu Pandey,"December 24, 2019",5, The app is easy to use and the songs come in a variety of difficulty levels. So if you are just a beginner or a pro there are different versions for songs. Love the app. There are English as well as Hindi songs. Awesome guys. 😍😍
1829,Gabriel Collier,"January 14, 2020",2," I would not suggest this app unless you are planning on getting the premium version. Otherwise, enjoy being bombarded by ads and not being able to use basic functions that only premium users have access to."
1830,Kate Sheehan,"January 20, 2020",2, Limited! Won't allow feedback on songs to be posted. Altering anything is a pain. The paid service is super limited and they pretty much only suggest songs that I already have. Wish it was more intuitive and allowed for real feedback.
1831,Tom Wallace,"January 22, 2020",1," Actually one is to good ,I have tried to use this program repeatedly 5 times so far .I love this program if and when it works .It has stopped working 5 times out of 5.and I loose all my work .What is the problem ,fix it or get out of buisness you are costing me money in lost shows and time ."
1832,plizzz pizza,"February 23, 2020",4, Very helpfull but i hate ad so i give 4 stars lol
1833,Garth Liddell,"February 23, 2020",3, It really would be helpful to have a page that explains exactly how to use it. I've seen the short video but found it totally unhelpful as a beginner.
1834,Semprini Aftershave,"February 1, 2020",5, All the issues I have submitted have been fixed. App works good and has a good selection of tabs.
1835,Mackenzie Popplewell,"November 13, 2019",3, I really want to give you guys 5 stars but there are some changes that could be made. I think the biggest one could be a section for beginner intermediate and hard all in sections that you could pick which one.
1836,Jasmine Sky,"November 25, 2019",5, Sinply Amazing! This is the best app I have found for learning and finding new songs to play. The Pro version is relatively cheap and provides you with twice the content! I cannot fault the app.
1837,M. Kuahiwinui,"November 29, 2019",1," This was dumb. I go thru the process of downloading it and when I enter a song to play it takes me to a pop up add for a however long free trial and I click ""x"" for no and it takes me back to the select song menu and never taking me to the song I want to play."
1838,Happy Gilmore,"November 27, 2019",5," This app is sooo much cooler then it looks,I love this app because it taught me how to play the ukulele and some really cool songs!!! This app is the beast and if you wanted to lern a instrument then this app is perfect for you. Thanks for this app!!!!!!!"
1839,Chris Russell,"December 9, 2019",5," I love it, I purchased this app a few years back and I switched phones and remembered this app. I came back to it and my pro version was still waiting on me. Thank you so much!!!! Best app hands down."
1840,Andrew Buhay,"December 6, 2019",5, The fact a platform such as this exists and has been developed as well as it has satisfies a need that has existed for a long time. The fee for pro is nominal and worthwhile and the credibility is great. Great utility and value
1841,Mike Y,"January 20, 2020",1," I signed up for a trial of the pro version, which is supposed to charge you after a 7 day trial period. On the same day of signing up for the trial, my bank was charged the full subscription amount. Very annoying."
1842,Henry Waller,"January 19, 2020",5, I won't lie... I used it free for a bit and then subscribed for £15 a year (£14.99 really) and for a year it seemed like an offer I couldn't refuse... Lovely community and I'm really enjoying it so far
1843,Nick Munoz,"January 20, 2020",1, You click on a tab in the free version and it asks you to pay. If you don't pay it doesn't let you see the tabs. This is basically just an advertisement unless you buy the paid version. I understand a small ad at the bottom of the screen but this is just unusable.
1844,Barth Slung,"January 25, 2020",1," It is not free like the website, but the website absolutely sucks now because there is a giant ""DOWNLOAD THE APP"" button constantly on the screen. So yeah, use something else. There are far better options."
1845,Kelvin Beck,"January 28, 2020",1," 90% of the app is behind a paywall, and if it is free content you get hit with a ""you should subscribe for more stuff"" message taking up your screen. Putting 12 ""subscribe now"" messages before you even get to try the app pretty much guarantees I'm not going to subscribe."
1846,Chuck 'Pops' Partington,"February 8, 2020",5, Very helpful and easy to use.
1847,Rezna Esmeralda,"February 13, 2020",5, this is the best app for song chords.I love it!!!!
1848,Sebastian Ovando Keller,"February 13, 2020",5," Lots of chords tab, it's nice."
1849,heather tinnaro,"March 16, 2020",5, I love this app. Autoscroll makes me look like I know what I'm doing.
1850,Stewart Muir,"February 29, 2020",5, Always works well for me. Don't mind the ads because they are usually for music stuff I might actually want
1851,Shawn Manning,"April 27, 2020",5, Use it everyday always the best!
1852,LeSassi,"April 23, 2020",5, This app is amazing! More than I have expected :)
1853,Kuya James,"November 18, 2019",5, Love the app and the features that come with the pro account are totally worth it! Been a fan since day 1. Easy to use and navigate. Best guitar app for anyone playing with strings.
1854,Brendan Cleaver,"November 27, 2019",5," I've been using Ultimate Guitar for about 10 years, and it has progressed so much. The app has evolved to include many amazing features, as well as being incredibly user friendly. Keep up the good work!"
1855,Sohaib Tariq,"November 27, 2019",4," Love the app. The only thing i would say they can do better is the searching system. Alot of songs are on there website but i couldnt find on the app. Apart from that, its great!"
1856,dana shorb,"December 5, 2019",1, Nothing but a ploy for your money. I used to use their website all the time and still occasionally do so I wanted to try the app. It's bad.

I'm sure if I buy a membership it would be better but everything pushes you to that so it's not a good free app. I've deleted it. Merry Christmas.
1857,OOPS,"December 24, 2019",5," Piano and guitars alike, this app has without a doubt the best selection of music available. The free version is really good and the pro is such good value anyway, it's only fair to support the hardworking developers and unlock some really useful features."
1858,Cole Carpenter,"December 29, 2019",1, Sound doesn't work which seems to be a common problem without a real answer since I've looked it up online. Since I paid for this app's subscription the review will remain at one star until this is fixed.
1859,Eric Connors,"January 23, 2020",3, Clunky app. Some songs' audio doesn't sync up like at all and any time you want to modify it with the settings it just screws it up. Sometimes it just makes me want to put my guitar down.
1860,Isaias Ramirez,"February 13, 2020",5, Excellent app for learning songs!!
1861,Stewart Ombou,"March 24, 2020",5, Yeah started playing the guitar again - thanks to Ultimate Guitar Chords! 😍
1862,Football Highlights,"February 24, 2020",5, Very helpful app for guitarist
1863,Ethan LeClair,"February 29, 2020",1," Ive tried to cancel my subscription 3 times and ive been continued to be charged, the most recent being today and i want it refunded immediately and confirmation of my cancelled subscription."
1864,ToniAnn Notarfrancesco,"April 12, 2020",5, Great app! Thank you!
1865,Vijaya Shree,"April 9, 2020",5, It is AWESOME AND I CAN PRATICE ON MY LOCKDOWN OR EVEN AFTER TO IMPROVE MORE. I CAN GIVE MY TALENT HIT THE WORLD.
1866,Spencer Wilcoxson,"November 20, 2019",2," I love this app! However, I'm trying to get noticed here, but it's super annoying how even after buying the app I'm still constantly getting things pop up and asking me to rate the app. Stop!"
1867,Joe Martin,"November 25, 2019",5," Good stuff. Not much money to pay for all you get and ease of access, although if you did want to spend ages googling tabs, you can still find nearly all the same stuff for free online"
1868,Daniel Moore,"December 11, 2019",5," Best teacher I've ever had. Nothing beats a personal tutor I'm sure, but as I learn songs, I'm learning techniques that help nail the sound correctly. This app has improved my playing greatly since I got serious about picking up a guitar."
1869,Adam McKinney,"December 16, 2019",1, Spam ads galore in this app. I even paid for the app several years ago to get away from all the spam but now they are trying to sell me something every turn. I will not be using this app anymore because of all these advertisements.
1870,stephen lee,"January 4, 2020",5, Had this app for years on multiple platforms. It's a healthy and productive community. Great content and support. The latest edition of video uploads is awesome. Keep up the great work UG!! 🤘🤘😛
1871,Kartik Jangam,"December 24, 2019",4," Amazing tabs especially for beginners (like me) The simplify feature is super helpful and lets you see the difference between chords. User contributed tabs are also awesome, I got to see how they perceived the same music."
1872,Stephanie Marie,"December 27, 2019",5, Name describes it thoroughly. App full of guitar tabs and chords. Dozens of versions of popular song you can think of and even some of the more obscure songs. I don't regret paying for the subscription.
1873,brett moberg,"December 20, 2019",3, App is super buggy. If I use the realistic tone the timing is wayyyyy off. But if I dont use it then the app works as it should. No matter how many times i delete it and reinstall it the bugs never go away. Please fix
1874,Antonio Estrada,"January 12, 2020",5," I always used the online website for years. When I saw the app like 6 yrs ago, I was hesitant to buy it for a dollar. Honestly really glad I did. It works like a charm and its super convenient"
1875,a manuel,"January 10, 2020",5," Great for finding lyrics, tabs, and chords. Haven't tried the video upload feature yet, but like seeing other people's short takes as motivation in learning and sharing songs, the vids are not all featuring guitar which is nice"
1876,TJ Pickering,"January 14, 2020",1," This app is garbage. It's ad heavy and it's slow. Often times I'm redirected from their website to the app and I have to find the song again, which is infuriating. I hate having to use this app, Ultimate Guitar blows."
1877,james wilson,"January 15, 2020",5, I have been with the app since it started which has been years. I use it every day. It's a great way to access user submitted tabs with ease. Thank you ultimate guitar for offering this service!
1878,Janet Moore,"January 22, 2020",5, Hello! So I got the app yesterday afternoon to find the problems I was having completely fixed! I'm now enjoying the app & grateful for the developer's hard work to fix this. I will totally recommend this app to anyone I know. Thank u and God bless.
1879,Miguel Agustín Durán,"January 25, 2020",1," The free version is practically unusable due to the hundreds of ads, videos and other useless stuff it keeps displaying. I understand they want users to upgrade, but this is excessive."
1880,Becca Cope,"February 1, 2020",5," Just brilliant, currently learning my first ever song. Already know the chords naturally cause of the way they have laid this app out. I've been struggling for ages to get confident in my knowledge but this place has it all!!"
1881,Brad Rogers,"February 3, 2020",5, Top notch tabs/chords!!
1882,Redi Agolli,"February 11, 2020",4, It is very nice!! But please add more albanian songs.
1883,Craig Jon Anderson,"March 2, 2020",3, Crappy updating from server/web to app to playlist. Change of tab in playlist does not update main tab. Cross device updates or sych poor particularly when it comes to key changes
1884,noel ponsi,"March 23, 2020",5, Really good app. Best of all tried
1885,Nicholas Taylor,"March 30, 2020",5, Brilliant for those little bits you can't quite nail down
1886,joseph fisher,"March 28, 2020",5, I love this. It's an essential if you want to play great tunes. All at your fingertips too.
1887,K B,"April 5, 2020",5, Helps to learn the fun songs
1888,Angela Lott,"April 25, 2020",5, Chose songs to suit your style and ability snd it simplifies transcribes almost plays it for you.
1889,Mike Stryk,"November 19, 2019",4," Great app for getting the actual chords. Sadly, not in bar format. Just words and chords. But between chordify with it's timing acirocy but dodgy chords and your app, I can pretty much nail all the songs I can find."
1890,Glenn Chavez,"November 21, 2019",5, The automation play along is very helpful while learning the songs. So many options and features to use. Very powerful App. Definitely a great tool to have on hand!!
1891,Stuart Cameron,"November 25, 2019",5, Love the app. It has helped me learn many different ways to play chords making it easier to move from one to another esp when playing songs that expect you to go up & down the frets.
1892,Mason Dickson,"November 29, 2019",5," Amazing. What started as a website I had to print tabs off of, is now a medium to meet other musicians, share music, learn classics, and get advice. It's my favorite app. 10/10"
1893,heath andrews,"December 9, 2019",1, App freezes my phone after update. Cant screenshot and free tabs keep getting ads for pro upgrade. I cant use website because of the constant try app popup. Used to love ugt but this has become a horrible experience for mobile users. VERY DISSATISFIED.
1894,TEAM_TG_ DYLAN,"January 1, 2020",5, This app is definitely awesome. If you want to learn how to play something I'm pretty sure this app has it. This app makes me happy. Every time I am upset or frustrated this app makes it go away. Thank you so much for this app 🤗.
1895,Russell Brennan,"December 20, 2019",1, The website makes it nearly impossible to use the site's tabs and tries to funnel users to the app. And yet the site one of the top search results for tabs! Not interested in installing an app when simple tabs will suffice!
1896,Cindy Orduño,"December 31, 2019",5," Been using this site for years and have seen many improvements along the way. I love that they're always looking to up their game and listen to feedback. Probably best library of song tabs out there too, (variety wise)."
1897,Matt Taggart,"January 7, 2020",2, Application consistently sends promotional offers or notifications when all notification options within the application are turned off. Some higher tempo songs have an issue with the tabs not being able to keep up with the audio.
1898,nick lelek,"January 12, 2020",1, I paid for pro and decided it was not worth it but they make it impossible to unsubscribe. Its not as simple as going to your subscriptions like they say because it doesnt even show up. Its sneaky thing to do and unethical.

I got lucky and bought this app before it was subscription based and I'm thankful I'm grandfathered in. But I would really like to BUY this app for my brother but. Not paying a subscription for this. I'd be willing to pay $20 one time but not a Netflix type thing.
1900,Linda Hauser,"January 2, 2020",5," We love this app. You can find any song, transpose it if needed. Listen to the actual music for reference while playing. Touch the highlighted cord to see how to play it, if you forget"
1901,paul dales,"January 18, 2020",5," apart from a disability I have which personally makes this difficult to use I can imagine you could definitely become a better musician with this app, they have thought of everything. And what's £20 a year, even I'm tight but not that tight. I've already impressed one mate."
1902,Cody Harmon,"January 16, 2020",5, Amazing app... I truly appreciate with great gratitude what I have learned and am able to find in the lessons of the ages and through these amazing tabs. This collection is solid and community is amazing. Thank you again so so much.
1903,David Morris,"January 27, 2020",1," You need to pay a monthly fee to auto scroll tabs. The developer claims below that free tabs can be auto-scrolled for free, but I kept clicking a link on a Carcassi piece (very much out of copyright) and only subscription options came up."
1904,KingTomTheBomb YT,"January 27, 2020",5, One of the best apps I've used in my life. Litterally life changing.. I've become a much better guitar playin in a week I went from beginner to intermediate in just a week and I plan on getting much better to come..

1914,Albert Nyilas,"November 9, 2019",4, Thanks for the app. It seems to me it has every song for guitar. Reason for the 4 star is because it doesn't have the strummimg writen. Other than that its amazing.

1916,Joshua Green,"November 24, 2019",1," They shut down the mobile site and are forcing this, which is NOT the same thing! The app is mostly ads, and getting to the tabs takes longer than just figuring out the songs I want to learn. Uninstalling forever."

1918,Frankie San Filippo,"December 11, 2019",1, My phone has never been hotter. I have the free version so I just see normal tabs. It's just a page with numbers on it and my battery goes does 10% ever 5 minutes! I could make a better app in a week
1919,Mr.Atomic 10,"December 30, 2019",5," Amazing app! So far the app has been working smooth (I've been using it for about a month) , it has every song that I have searched for, and the tabs are accurate."
1920,bill mcbeath,"December 2, 2019",1, l used to get a lot of features for free. Now all it seems to want you to do is pay and even prevents you from avoiding it. Have now uninstalled your app. Its now absolute rubbish.
1921,carter,"November 8, 2019",5," Great app, been playing guitar for about a year now, and i love this app. I personally recommend getting pro though, makes it a lot easier to get around on the app"
1922,Joanne Breen,"February 2, 2020",5, I love this app. It's helped me get back into playing guitar again!! If there were 6 stars this would be it 🏅
1923,Kristi Gannon,"November 22, 2019",1," Haven't been on the app in a while. I ""purchased"" the app when it went on sale for $0 after having an account for years when it was free. Very disappointed to see it went to a subscription-based model."
1924,scootermc scooterface,"November 23, 2019",5," It's a very nice app for people who are just getting into guitar, the only complaint is a feel it lacks a bit of information about certain tools, but a few Google searches and trial and error fixes that problem in no time"
1925,David Nikiforuk,"December 1, 2019",5," Have used the app through many updates and iterations. It has been and remains my go to app for tabs and much more on multiple platforms. Must have for guitar, bass, and ukelele at least."
1926,Bhargesh Ved,"January 11, 2020",2, I bought the pro version as i like the features. Unfortunately i am unable to add my shots. I reported the issue in the last week of December as be havent recieved any resolution yet. The app has flips features and functionality but i am unable to use the add Shots feature
1927,Veronica T,"December 3, 2019",2," The non-membership version of this app is confusing and frustrating to use. This is the 3rd time I'm giving this app a try, and it really sucks, for both the uke and the guitar."
1928,Christie B. Wahl,"December 4, 2019",5," Use it every week for Church songs, helps a lot that you can transpose up & down as well as simplify. I can write my husband's music for him while he's at work, saves us time. Very helpful app 👍"
1929,Jason Mahoney,"December 6, 2019",5," 5 Stars isn't enough to convey my sincere appreciation for your app. UGC&T Relit a fire I thought was long gone. Not only do I play more. I've actually noticed that I'm playing a lot better. I have no complaints. Thank you guys for helping me accomplish my goals and objectives. As soon as I get over...Full Review5 Stars isn't enough to convey my sincere appreciation for your app. UGC&T Relit a fire I thought was long gone. Not only do I play more. I've actually noticed that I'm playing a lot better. I have no complaints. Thank you guys for helping me accomplish my goals and objectives. As soon as I get over my stage fright I'll post a video. You all rock! Thanks so much! Sincerely you friend, Jason M.Mahoney"
1930,chiknlord 000,"December 10, 2019",4, It's a great app. A lot of free tabs and they've even got the underground bands that not many people know of. It can be a bit glitchy at times but overall a wonderful app.
1931,Brian Bessey,"January 8, 2020",5," TURN ON YOUR METRONOMES. This fixes the bug where the lead instrument is inaudible. Thanks to Ultimate Guitar for responding so quickly, and as promised, I am changing the rating back to 5 stars."
1932,Zack Brackeen,"January 4, 2020",5, First of all trying to find a good tab/ chord guide for where the chord changes are is very difficult. Thank you for breaking it down and making it simple as well as enjoyable to play.
1933,Zachary Comp,"January 1, 2020",1," Free version is totally useless, looking up tabs in internet browser is easier. Downloaded because the website told me the app had a feature to play the song out loud, but that's locked behind the paid version."
1934,Chane Jordaan,"January 10, 2020",5, Definitely an app that all beginner and more experienced guitarists/musicians need at hand. I can keep all my tabs on there and even a free monthly pro subscription by tabbing out the songs I love. Props to the developers!
1935,Noah Naugle,"January 23, 2020",2, It's ok but bad for beginners. If you want to transpose to an easier chord you have to get the monthly subscription. Works ok tho for intermediate players. Honestly it really annoys me.
1936,Cake Ch,"January 28, 2020",4," I haven't gone through all the options but the availability of songs got me spending. Actually forgot to unsubscribe after free period but then it was so bad. Got it on a discount, too!"
1937,Tamoy Lawson,"February 20, 2020",5, It's really helpful full in an amazing way.
1938,Ryan J,"March 1, 2020",5, Great experience easy and free
1939,John Stroup,"March 12, 2020",5, Great song selection. Multiple versions I can pick and choose. Good reference and playlist app.
1940,Francis Panuncialman,"March 24, 2020",5, Complete app. Anyone interested getting the premium will get their money's worth. Highly recommended. Anyone starting should get this app.
1941,Liz Lefebvre,"April 15, 2020",5," Love having the listrn song as i try to play and follow along, haha not always easy."
1942,Arezoo Makvandi,"April 17, 2020",1," You can't learn ANYTHING unless you pay first. Just use the website, don't waste your time on the app."
1943,James Richards,"April 18, 2020",5, Brilliant. Love the pro function.
1944,Darryl Ella,"April 28, 2020",5, reliable app for studying songs for guitar
1945,Ricky Alexander,"December 4, 2019",4," Great app, especially if you get premium. Would be nice if all features worked on all devices. For example, not autoscroll on my tablet, but it's there on my phone."
1946,Rob Kallos,"December 4, 2019",5," Love my UG app & subscription. Has been an indespensible tool in my progression as a guitar player. Loved it so much, I bought one for my son who uses it regularly as well. Thanks guys!!!"
1947,Jeremiah Oakes,"December 7, 2019",5," I have used ultimate-guitar ever since I was in high school. It was only a website, and I had to print my tabs out in the library and take them home and learn them, so 13 years now! thank you."
1948,Joshua Fleming,"December 14, 2019",5," I have been using this app for nearly ten years, and UGT never ceases to amaze me with their innovations and growth. Super helpful; a must have for every guitarist!"
1949,tehehe,"December 19, 2019",5, I have been using this for a while and i love it one thing is its a shame that autoscroll is not free but on the contrary not many apps have that feature and it does allow you to have autoscroll for free on a pc it would just be better if it was aslo free on android and ios
1950,Jacob Soet,"December 27, 2019",5, It is amazing how easy you can find the lyrics for nice songs with the guitar accords. It can play it too and you can forward it to your email so that it can be printed! Superb! I love it! Wil subscribe!!
1951,Joshua Denham,"December 24, 2019",5," Great app. No issues. Thousands upon thousands of songs. Only issue is with certain bands removing tabs because of licensing, but this isn't something the app devs can do anything about :)"
1952,Tyler Cote,"January 3, 2020",4," The app doesn't let me sign in directly. That means when I wipe my machine (frequently), I have to go through the whole selection process again, which is quite annoying when I just want to play."
1953,Kelly Plewe,"January 9, 2020",5, I love how all the songs are available to me anytime I want them! I also love how there are simplified versions as well so songs that are harder can be easier to play. I love this app why more than any other guitar app I've had!
1954,Christian Hernandez,"January 10, 2020",3," Good app, tuner desperately needs upgrading. The tabs are extremely helpful, but the chromatic tuner is not. It doesn't pick up the guitar's sound and is not accurate like guitar tuna."
1955,Jolly Wolly,"February 1, 2020",3, Battery drains too fast and phone heats up due to constant moving adverts. The desktop version us mich more bearable with adblocker.
1956,Olli Huhtanen,"March 5, 2020",2, The adds may contain free tabs. Adds may crash the app. Tabs freeze on adds. Devs get the message to managers.
1957,RocknRollFool,"November 11, 2019",1," Used to be really good and useful, now is not to great, way too many ads and you have you pay to use any of the features which made it unique at once."
1958,Kaidance Johnson,"November 11, 2019",5, Ooooh yes! It makes it way easier and alot more fun to learn and play your favorite songs. Even with all the little tools which make it 100% better it's just awesome
1959,Sofia Chiarandini,"December 8, 2019",1, Years ago this app was great. Now they make it impossible to use without buying a membership. Total ripoff. For that money just go get iReal Pro - one time purchase and much better app for chord charts.
1960,Mike Briggs,"January 5, 2020",5, Love it! Easy to use and pretty much spot on tabs.....I use a few different apps when trying to learn a song but this one always comes out as the most accurate... thank you
1961,Genuis Gaming,"January 2, 2020",5, This app is so amazing I have been playing guitar for 2 years now and I have used it every step of the way. I would like to thank the creators of the app for making such a wonder platform to learn new songs.
1962,Josh McDevitt,"January 5, 2020",5, I've had the app for years and they keep improving it. It has always been the best source I can find to learn how to play anything from rock or pop all the way to Christian music. Love this app.
1963,Christian Paolo Nacor,"December 29, 2019",3," A great app, no complaints in regards to the app performance. But please dont be too aggressive on popping your PRO version advertisements. Just simply disable the pro features. Believe me, people will purchase the pro license if its not forced to them."
1964,Catie Tong,"January 3, 2020",5, I love this app!!!!! I love hearing other people and being able to post my own videos. Not to mention the thousands upon thousands of guitar tabs. Thanks for this awesome app!
1965,Martin Yeak,"January 4, 2020",2," Other than the fact it constantly shoves ads down your throat, the ads disappear and pop up in between my tabs, causing my tabs to shift up and down, which makes it very irritating to play."
1966,Ali Ibra,"January 14, 2020",1," Too bad app It's money machine but to be honest Its an awesome idea , wonderful design and very helpful But you must pay for every single thing that you want to do ... im unfortunately going to uninstall it right after I install it ..... good luck guys"
1967,Devin Sharp,"January 23, 2020",5, Love it. The first place I go to for tabs. Great community of musicians. I highly recommend downloading whether your a complete beginner or a seasoned pro. Rock on
1968,the_Cry0nic,"January 15, 2020",5," Tabs available offline while om on the go, this app and the website both helped me teach myself guitar, and with an optimistic mindset, the shots feature can puah you to be better. I reccomend this app, and give it a 5/5 stars"
1969,Brandon Dobbinson,"January 27, 2020",5," Didn't work, freezed during personalization stage at the very beginning of start up. They were very responsive and fixed the issue with update. Works great now, thank you."
1970,Jeremy Smith,"January 25, 2020",5," This app has opened up a new world of music and enjoyment. As a new guitar player, this app empowers me to try new songs and feel much more confident as a result. Easy to use, and hours of fun."
1971,Grace Murariu,"January 31, 2020",5," I LOVE this app! It is free and easy to use unless you want to upgrade it. You are able to choose the chords that you want for various instruments! I use Ukulele, Guitar, and Piano Chords and they are really helpful!"
1972,Ledwin Julius,"February 11, 2020",1, When I was going to transpose the chord from web it said I can do it for free with the app. Then when I tried to transpose from the app it asked me to pay to do transpose. Scam?
1973,SanSinSih,"March 27, 2020",5, So far so good. Maybe need put guitar stem
1974,s r,"March 22, 2020",3," Good to learn. But If you have correction/little bit improvement suggestions, don't waste your time submitting"
1975,Damian Botha,"November 12, 2019",3, Awesome app just one problem android chords are very different than IOS please look into that because I want to learn powerchords and one of the names is a B5 chord on IOS it is 100% correct on Android very different please make it the same Thanks guys!
1976,Tony Oseland,"November 27, 2019",4, I had to stop playing because of hand injuries and arthritis. This app (and a new 12 string electric) are giving my music back. Thank you! Looking forward to more lessons and top.
1977,John Browne,"December 11, 2019",5," auto scroll should be free Gotta pause and ring out chords etc Bit like ya old song book as you, mid strum, turn the page so the song doesnt flow. I like the collections idea, you should add heaps more Ultimate Guitar rocks Happy xmas to all"
1978,Michael Wampole,"December 12, 2019",5," Indispensable, couldn't learn as many songs so quick without it! If your serious about playing, a few bucks for the pro version is an unbelievable value. Thanks Ultimate Guitar!!"
1979,russell vineyard,"December 13, 2019",5, So far I'm really digging this app. Everything I've needed to learn is right in front of me. The tabs are great and the scrolling options are useful to help keep time.
1980,Kico Febo,"December 15, 2019",5," Ease of use together with enormous amount of songs and flexibility (transpose, chords, lyrics scroll...) Makes this a must have in my phone, tablet and desktop computer. Thanks!"
1981,Carsten Willemsen,"December 17, 2019",5, Fantastic easy to use app. Not all music I look for is included which is by no means the developer's fault. Love the app and I try using it as often as possible
1982,Gabriel Acosta,"December 28, 2019",4," The free version allows to save favorites and have those saved songs available offline... Thanks! The free version would've been unusable otherwise, so this is great to have available for free."
1983,Joshua Glover,"December 23, 2019",5," good learned a lot in short time, very helpful and as a free user really is a good free service, and pro features are continually tempting showing they are building on an already complete package as opposed to limiting"
1984,Elisheva N,"December 21, 2019",5," Love the app, been using it for years. Simple and useful. When I had trouble logging in from a new device I emailed them and they were very responsive and helpful."
1985,Brian Rospond,"December 25, 2019",5," Love this app! I run an open mic, and anytime there is a song i dont know off the top of my head, within a minute i can be playing it! Great app!"
1986,Danial Donny,"December 24, 2019",5, I have like be a ultimate guitar user for years..i download gp file from the website years back.I like the simplicity of the app and how it work.no hassle clicking etc..just straight to the point..it soo convenient for me as performer when crowds requested a songs

1988,Steve Moen,"April 1, 2020",5, Simply an awesome app for any player.
1989,Arda Özçelik,"January 6, 2020",4," This app is good not wonderful because of integration. If you playing guitar when look to the tabs, you will be miss in the tabs numbers you are not following. Please fix the issues. Thanks"
1990,herve constantin,"January 23, 2020",1," Used To have it.. the paid version.. a few years ago but I don't know what happened when I changed phone so I stopped using it. I thought I'd give it another go but nope.. got to repay. Shame it used to be my ""go to"" for tabs and chords !"
1991,Zach mac,"January 29, 2020",5," Best guitar app ive used. 12/10 heckin good!! I always recommend to my friends and family and they love it too, except the fact that they have to pay subscription fees instead of one time fee."
1992,James Rhine,"January 31, 2020",2, Always crashes my android phone. Can maybe get 2 songs before it freezes for 10 minutes and doesnt allow me to even exit the app. It just crashes everything. This app used to be so much better.
1993,Flaming Gamer,"February 3, 2020",5, I use this app EVERY day for ukulele and piano. Very helpful and a big thanks to the developers!
1994,V paudel,"February 9, 2020",5, It's really awesome . I can find every songs chords in it. thanks
1995,Phil Cousins,"February 15, 2020",1, Was great now not. Millions of tabs and even more adverts and ways to p*** you off and interrupt navigation.
1996,Brandon Brooks,"April 13, 2020",5," Dope app. Would like to be able to see ukulele chords with official tabs, but otherwise great."
1997,sharath chandra,"November 18, 2019",2," Collection is good but app is really bad. Everytime I open a link in chrome it points to app, which is great but it just point to home page in app rather than my song page. Fix this bug."
1998,PRASENJIT ROY,"November 23, 2019",1, Ultimate guitar is getting worse day by day. All they need is money. Click any button in the app.. will lead you straight to paypal or other payment option. Uninstalling.
1999,Philip Russell,"November 25, 2019",5," Awesome app, have used the site for a good few years now and the app is a perfect accompaniment to it. Plus loads of free giveaways is a bonus in anyone's book..."
2000,Cristina Palacios,"November 26, 2019",4, I love this app but the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it lags a lot sometimes. Other than the occasional lag this app is perfect for learn tabs or chords.
2001,Kyle Hancock,"November 28, 2019",5, Love the app. Any chords you need are right here! In lots of different varieties of music and play styles. Go for the pro! It's worth it.
2002,Dalibor Milakovic,"December 4, 2019",4, Great if you have a really powerful phone. My phone crashed 2 times i 10 minutes. But i really love the app. Not expensive at all for what it provides.
2003,Angelica Canillo,"December 17, 2019",5, Ive learned to play the acoustic and the bass guitar using this app. Ive been using it for almost 10 years now and ive never been disappointed ! Keep up the great work
2004,Ben Whitehead,"December 28, 2019",3," At it's core, this is a very good app. Disappointingly however, some of it's best features are stuck behind a paywall which is not worth the amount of money it costs."
2005,Max Morse,"December 21, 2019",5, Probably one of the best training tools out there if you go to UTube you may find something great or a beginner that you want to show a better way to do a song or a lick your trying to learn.
2006,Zero Fox Given,"December 27, 2019",1, This app sucks for official tabs. No lyrics. It's all buggy and sometimes plays other instruments at different intervals. The tempos are off on the official tabs as well. Please fix.
2007,Quiyan Channel,"December 26, 2019",5, Nice work. Been using ultimate guitar since HS days . That was like 14 years -ish ago. Glad to see that we have an application that can help newbie guitar players.
2008,Vasama3,"January 4, 2020",2, I love that you can find every song (that I've looked for) on the app. But I can't even be on the app for more than 45 min (or 1h30 if my phone is plugged in) because it drains my battery so fast.

2012,XHanShotFirstX,"March 26, 2020",5, Great app very easy to use!
2013,Ben Carriveau,"March 27, 2020",5," Flawless, even with just the free version the adds are few and far between!"

2017,Ayano Hanesaki,"November 13, 2019",5, Great App for those who wants to find guitar chords or tabs for the song they want. Also the lyrics are there so you don't have to search for the lyrics online.

2019,Matthew Puralewski,"November 17, 2019",5, The team is constantly adding new things and making adjustments. It is easy to navigate and goes far beyond just playing the guitar. Definitely a worthwhile investment.
2020,Robert DeLorenzo,"November 25, 2019",5," Great tool for learning songs... ability to set printing prefernces would be helpful ...font, font size margins... or option to save as a pdf to on song or onedeive, drop box, Gdrive etc. For assembly into a set ..."
2021,vid4man,"November 27, 2019",5," Excellent library of tunes/songs. Whether you lean towards your personal interpretation of tunes/songs or you are looking to hit it note for note, UG is an outstanding resource."
2022,Bryce Wilson,"December 2, 2019",1," When playing a pro tab it does not auto scroll far enough, leaving half the staff off the screen. Makes it basically useless. I will not be resubscribing if this is not fixed."
2023,Olive Oil,"December 3, 2019",5," Chords and words at your fingertips. If you don't memorize easily, this app allows you to play and sing hours of music. I enjoy it very much."

2025,John Trott,"December 21, 2019",5, I use the free version and it is great! You get lyrics and chords. I use this to build up my confidence and repertoire for scouts and small groups.
2026,Taylor Nodell,"December 24, 2019",1, Riddled with ads and constantly asking you to buy it. So much so that it makes the app difficult to use. I always choose to use the web view when I can.
2027,Gavin O,"January 25, 2020",5," Great app for learning and, if you're an amateur who pulls the guitar out after a few drinks like myself, great for playing along with scrolling lyrics and chords. Also love the fact you can customise the tab to make it easier for playing along to and save adjustments to pitch to suit voice"

2032,WJM83167,"April 11, 2020",1, Too many pop up ads to much stuff running in background slowing it and sometimes stopping
2033,Nicola Bresciani,"November 11, 2019",5, Sometimes slow but does the job . its my live songs book . wish the screen could split so while a finish a song i could look in my list and select the nxt one . overall nice and working app.ty.
2034,Colby Ford,"November 10, 2019",5," Mind blowing app. Wish i had this 15 years ago when i started guitar. If you really want to learn or are trying to improve your skills, look no further. Download now."
2035,fajri osman,"November 13, 2019",5," It's getting easier with this app. Not like those days when I have to buy guitar magazines just to get the tabs. Plus the auto scroll..I can jam anytime, anywhere. Useful app"
2036,Joshua Allen,"November 13, 2019",4, Absolutely my go to for wanting to learn a song. And yeah since mostly submitted by users of the app you've got some wading to do but it's worth it. Especially I'd you want to get into a real guitar regiment.
2037,sas.tronaut,"November 18, 2019",2, It is nice to have easy access to so many tabs and chords. But the app is SO SLOW because of the many many many many ads that have been crammed into it.
2038,Sherman Kester,"November 21, 2019",5," This app is as good as the website. I love perusing it and learning new things, or picking up my guitar to try new songs anywhere with this app."
2039,Ethan Greger,"November 23, 2019",1," I literally can't play a single song on here because it slaps ""pay for a yearly subscription!"" in my face. When I try to exit this it takes me back to the menu."
2040,Don P,"November 29, 2019",1, App worked well until I painfornit about 2 weeks after paying the app just wouldn't work on my phone I got a reset I did everything but I pretty much had to spend$20 for.amd app I couldnt use but I love ultimate guitar and hope it work out for the rest of you

2042,Karl Somerville,"November 27, 2019",5," Great app, although it seems to not want to print, cloud print just goes mental. *UPDATE: I realised it was the Cloudprint App going nuts, not UG. Now 5* cheers lads, great app."
2043,Munday Morning,"December 1, 2019",5, This app is extremely helpful with learning and polishing up on your songs. Premium version isn't outrageous on price either but the basic version is all I've ever needed personally.
2044,Hank Hill,"November 29, 2019",5," It's only gotten better with time 10 years ago downloading pages to print off on the computer to being handheld, easy to navigate and tons of options to fit your playing style"
2045,Pete Beck,"December 1, 2019",4, This is a great app for learning songs. Only improvements I request is the ability to edit set lists (change play order) and to automatically go to the next song.
2046,Rick Ypma,"December 3, 2019",5, After the major updates last year this app has become AMAZING. I can't imagine a better guitar app. I love that tabs are available offline. I love the community vibe on it. Thanks UG.
2047,Adam Crowley,"December 4, 2019",5, Extremely user friendly. It's the only app that has constant updates where developers listen to feedback and constructive criticism. 100% worth buying for all the awesome features
2048,Sir Firebird,"December 19, 2019",5," I started using UG online years back when I was first teaching myself how to play, and the app has done nothing but make an awesome resource even more convenient. Worth the upgrade to pro for sure 👌"
2049,Jeremy Kurtti,"December 24, 2019",5," Although I've just started using the app, it's quite easy to use. I like the tempo and stop/start features. Very intuitively designed!"
2050,Don Weatherby,"December 22, 2019",5, Such an amazing app. A must have for guitar learners. Also the tonebridge app is the most explosive guitar addon I've ever seen. Thanks so much for your hard work on this. Keep up the good work.
2051,Johann Schuster,"January 1, 2020",2," Can't do much with the app without a subscription. Just wanted to check something out for an hour or two, not interested in a year subscription. Tons of awesome tabs online, this ain't the only one out there :)"
2052,Andrea Goehl,"December 26, 2019",3, Accessibility usually makes this my last choice for chords. I seem to always have to go through several steps just to get to a simple song.
2053,Adam Ryan,"December 27, 2019",1, Absolutely useless for playing any decent songs as if you want to play anything good you have to pay for the pro version and to use their tuner it metronome you have to pay for that too. Overall I've had an ultimate experience with this app
2054,Robynne Ashby,"December 25, 2019",5, Really easy to navigate the app. I also enjoy the selection of tabs. Even being able to chose different tabs for the same song. Thank you!
2055,RyanM,"December 30, 2019",2, Can't zoom in and out tabs. No full screen available. That useless upper white settings bar on the top. There's no way to get rid of it. What year is it??? I just wish I could use the mobile browser
2056,Lit_Regulus_ WeUs,"January 1, 2020",5," Wht i like the most is when i search any kpop song the chord and the whole lyrics even to provide the song exist.. Its rare fr apps to have lots of kpop songs, only some of it with limited songs. Thank you fr great apps!!! Really helps me"
2057,Awkward Human Liz,"January 10, 2020",1," Extremely disappointed. Couldn't use the website because every feature requires the app, and when I finally give in and decide to install it it forces me to pay to access those features. That's dirty play."
2058,Michael Stenson,"January 20, 2020",4, As a guitar beginner I find I've got everything I need in one place. I just wish some of the songs soundtracks to play along to we're a better quality.
2059,chicken_talk565,"January 18, 2020",1," I put a negative review but it got worse. It overheads my phone, crashes all the time bugs are everywhere and it's non stop ads and forced pay walls. Only recently starred to learn guitar and this has only put me off. Thanks.🙃🙃🙃"
2060,Ariel Griffin,"January 20, 2020",5, This app really helped me learn how to play my instrument. I love how there are songs that aren't very common on there as well! It's also a nice opportunity to show off your talent!
2061,Liam Fionan,"January 15, 2020",1, A waste of space without paying exorbitant subscription fees for basic functionality. There is a website that does the exact same thing the app does without taking up space on your phone.
2062,Ronald Menezes,"January 21, 2020",5, Simple superb and awesome app. Found the chords to be simple and perfect. Makes playing 🎸 so so simple and adorable. Auto scroll and listen work absolutely well together. Great job and a must for all music lovers and instrumentalists. Absolutely ✨✨✨✨✨
2063,Đức Hiếu,"January 18, 2020",2," the website forces you to download the app if you are using mobile. once you download the app it gives you popup of the paid versions and ads. it even tries to ""personalize"" your experience by making you choose from its selection of popular and overplayed songs"
2064,mark robins,"January 30, 2020",5, You can find most songs here but make sure you are learning the song in the right key. Chords and tabs are pretty good and most are correct. If you want to learn a song then here is a good place to learn.
2065,Joel Stevens,"February 5, 2020",5," Wow, I can go anywhere there is a piano now and have spontaneous music moments. Sang a duet, in a pub with a great singer last night which gave me and others goosebumps."
2066,Adam Aaron,"February 20, 2020",5, Love it. Always find what I need!
2067,Evan Van Der Molen,"March 5, 2020",4, If u dont have premium its not worht it... But if u do it is a great oppulortunity to learn and have gun
2068,Rika Andhina,"March 7, 2020",5," Good application for beginner like me, very helpfull"
2069,Emma Germany,"April 3, 2020",4, Im just sad i gotta pay money for the good stuff (which is completly understandable im not mad at them im mad at my bank acct) ive used this app for years its great it even has some lo-fi songs
2070,Shah Dan,"April 7, 2020",4, The Best apps for beginners player
2071,legreat Spacejockey,"January 7, 2020",5," best guitar app out there. from the music selection to the UI, this is the best and the shots are a new way to share your journey to learn playing."
2072,Eric Hays,"November 9, 2019",5, The pro series is phenomenal my guitar playing has exceeded my expectations because of this app I'm an avid Pro drummer with minimal guitar skills but since I've started using this app I have over 50 songs that I can play now
2073,Farra Michel,"December 13, 2019",4, I really like this app. My main problem is that I want to change from a monthly to a yearly subscription and it won't give me the option. I'm cancelling this and finding something else.
2074,David McKinnon,"November 29, 2019",5, I have great luck finding songs that I am interested in and with the ability to change the keys to suit my voice and challenge my chord changes it has helped my playing immensely!
2075,Colin Lynch,"November 29, 2019",5, This app is fantastic! Always updating with useful features and tools! Has been a major factor behind me mastering many a song and improving my overall guitar ability! Get this app!!!
2076,Nina L Clark,"December 3, 2019",5," I love the newer features like ""Simply"". Great for a 3-chorder like me! Also being able to listen to the song within the app."
2077,Aaron Nyquist,"December 7, 2019",5, Ultimate Guitar is the ultimate app for guitar tab. If you play in a cover band or just want to learn techniques from your favorite guitarists this a must have.
2078,James Harlow,"January 3, 2020",5, Easy to navigate and great helping tools. Love the scrolling helps keep hands free while practicing. From old time classics to current tunes this is a true musician's friend.
2079,C T,"December 29, 2019",1," Advertised as ""free"" but most of the functionalities is behind a pay wall. Only install this if you're willing to pay a $5 per month subscri9"
2080,Sacha Roussel,"November 25, 2019",5, Lots of versions of every song and awesome choices from begginer to advance. Edit: added great features where people get to add videos to showcase their skills. Another 5 star!
2081,Ryan Sinclair,"November 26, 2019",5," This app has helped me figure out so many things with relative ease. They set it up to be user friendly and have a huge amount of songs to choose from, i love it!"

2083,Mc Fibbs,"November 9, 2019",1, wow this app sucks paywall on everything.....freight train really? you want beginners to engage with your app so they stay. instead you paywall a song like this. ill go elsewhere thanks EDIT: love the 'I dont care' spammed response to honest criticism though.
2084,Nathan Jewett,"November 8, 2019",5, I would have never learned to play with out Ultimate Guitar. Wish I could give eleven stars since that's what I have been cranking it up to since 2010.
2085,Ace Diver,"November 22, 2019",1, I downloaded the app and can't even use it because every time I pick a song it asks if I want to buy the upgraded version of the app. When I close the add/promo it take me back to the home screen. Terrible app
2086,Abbad Abigail,"November 23, 2019",5," Just the best guitar chords apps out there, variety of different chords for the same song makes it easier to master a song if you find a hard chords in a particular version. 5/5"
2087,Corey Broadbent,"November 30, 2019",1," Seems like it would be a cool app, if you want to pay monthly to do anything on this app. 1 star because they force you to pay to do anything on this app Uninstalling. Their website is free..."
2088,Arek Parsons,"December 3, 2019",5, Amazing features. Love all the neat tools and variety of uses for this simple to use app. It's a must-have for guitarists of all skill levels.
2089,Erron Silver,"December 8, 2019",2, This app used to be great and I would have given it 5 stars in the past but over time it's become more bloated and sluggish to the point where it's almost unusable on my phone.
2090,noya daon,"December 15, 2019",5, Ita great! Theres a wide collection of chords and tabs and its realy easy to use both for guitar and ukulele. After a lot of time i upgraded to a pro account which has some extra featurs
2091,Sioban Kennedy,"December 17, 2019",5, I have learned how to read tablature using this app. Also like the functionality of simplifying and/or transposing to adjust to my playing level and vocal range. Fab app!
2092,Madelin Groenhagen,"January 6, 2020",5," Great app y'all! I play piano and my bf plays guitar so I love how it shows not only the tab for guitar, but it shows the chords for the piano! Solid program for learning songs!"
2093,Tamara Jones,"January 15, 2020",5," 56 y/o. Absolutely new to guitar. Got a bass for Christmas 👍. My son told me about this app. We were picking the first day. After almost a month, I'm impressed 😎😂 with how easy this makes it. Well worth the small price 😜🎸"
2094,imrich skarupa,"January 22, 2020",5, Great app has been by my side every step of the way since the day i first picked up a guitar years it's pretty much a must have for the modern guitarist these days.
2095,Kris Moe,"January 28, 2020",5, I've really enjoyed this app as a novice guitar player that allows you hear the song the way it's meant to be played and the scroller has been really handy.
2096,Russell Campbell,"February 12, 2020",5, This app is super user friendly! No more pausing to scroll! Well worth the money!
2097,Tarun Juluru,"February 27, 2020",5, Loved this app! Easy to use beautifully built with right features. Worth paying.
2098,Isobel Hemming,"April 10, 2020",5, Great app for any kind of fake music
2099,eric murphy,"December 30, 2019",5," Initially thought ads were too much, but I hardly notice them. Wish I could transpose in the free version. Great app tho. Use it alot. Fully recommend"
2100,Lisa Gottschalk,"November 14, 2019",3," I'm just starting. Figuring out how this all works. As soon as I become more familiar with everything as well as honing my guitar skills, I will return and update my end rating. Thanks"
2101,JOEL VICTORIO,"December 15, 2019",1," don't install this app. before the PRO version has transposition. now, it's gone. they disable it and have you paid in a monthly basis. what a heck app. Sorry. Can you return the transposition feature?"
2102,Quintyn Carter,"December 19, 2019",1, How is it that the backing track sound profile glitches out the tab it will crawl at half the speed of the tab. It's getting ridiculous that the app works fine then an update breaks it again
2103,Rick Sanchez,"December 31, 2019",5, You need to pay for the membership to unlock original chords and tabs and the tuner and the other features but the free membership will do. Best guitar chord app that I've downloaded though.
2104,Steve rayer,"January 7, 2020",5, Just plain works and good tabs are easy to find. In my band we do live requests and sometimes people throw some real curves my way. This app saves me from being stumped.
2105,Bryan Fraser,"January 9, 2020",4," does a pretty good job for what I need it for a little slow and choppy at times but tabs on the go is so convenient I don't really care, probably my device anyways."
2106,Tom Sweazea,"January 24, 2020",4," I actually play a Suzuki Electric Auto -Harp and have found just about all the songs i want to play. Need to interact with Spotify... But all in all, worth the money to go Premium 😎"
2107,Kaia Rose,"January 30, 2020",2, this app shuts down everything else on my phone nd theres been many times my phone restarts because someone texted me if I'm on this app. its wonderful for learning new songs but i'd rather have it not shut my phone down.
2108,Jason Dela Cerna,"February 4, 2020",5, A great app for beginners and pro. Let the music live on!
2109,Troy Lucci,"February 18, 2020",5, The absolute best guitar app I've ever found.
2110,Squrrlboy Squaker,"March 20, 2020",5, Spotify tabs. Best thing ever. PERIOD.
2111,Rene Borromeo,"March 20, 2020",1," I know we all need to make money, but try another scheme where you don't force me to subscribe before I can use your services. I am not going to pay for subscription for things I can get somewhere else for free."
2112,Khor KWL,"March 22, 2020",1, When I tried to use the app the app just closes and bring me back to the app store
2113,anjinneth macunat,"March 31, 2020",1, It used to be good. But now it crashes and a lot of ads!
2114,Avenging Angel,"April 11, 2020",1, So many ads.
2115,Kyle Hohman,"April 17, 2020",5, App. Is easy to use. Very large library. Love it. Thank you
2116,Shane Kosick,"November 26, 2019",5, Some of the new features are a little quirky but still a great tool. I preferred the older versions myself but I understand the need to offer new features.
2117,Michael Barton,"November 21, 2019",5," Good app, don't know of a better one for chords. They've improved it quite a bit and the ads aren't as obtrusive as they used to be."
2118,John Dwyer,"November 12, 2019",2, There's a weird blues riff that plays all the time the app is open. This interferes with playing the tab as it's being read.
2119,OD Fuze,"November 17, 2019",2," I'm really upset that before the upgrade that Ultimate guitar had, I PAID for the services, and now I have to pay YET AGAIN to look at tabs. I'm uninstalling and just looking online :/"
2120,Edward Macarchick,"November 20, 2019",5, This app is phenomenal! I couldn't think of anything in the world of apps for musicians that helps me as much as Ultimate Guitar Tabs!
2121,Cole Skinner,"November 21, 2019",2, The ads have gotten ridiculous. I adore this app but now you can't even use auto scroll without buying the premium version. I am currently looking for other chord/tab apps
2122,Shashi Kant Sinha,"November 25, 2019",5, I loved this so much but it's been just 2. Days of my guitar learning 😂.......and I've bought it's subscription too...lol....but still in the journey it's going to be a partner with me
2123,Thomas Pluhacek,"November 25, 2019",5, Always enjoyed going to your site to learn old songs that an old guy likes to play. You guys have all the good stuff. Thanks. Tom
2124,Kenneth Way,"November 26, 2019",2, Weak ux weak search engine has problem getting redirected from different web browsers etc. I'm happy with my subscription since there are no ads anymore but the app needs a lot of upgrades.
2125,Heinrich Bosch,"November 30, 2019",5," Just fantastic, obviously the devs are not responsible for the tabs on here, the app is great but I would love a feature that somehow rate how correct the tabs are, not just the likes counter."
2126,Rudmer Visser,"December 5, 2019",5," Awesome app and website, the pro version is also definitely worth it. Had it for about a year now and still use it very often!"
2127,Buck Fitch,"December 9, 2019",5, Finally a tool that can help the lazy guy learn not only whole songs but chords as well. Easy to figure out this app and not a bad price. Its I'm my purchase list. Thanks man
2128,Savy Rivka Powell,"December 21, 2019",3, Thank you for explaining. After installing a screen pops up asking for subscription fees and I didn't realize I could opt out and just use a free version.
2129,Kartik Rochwani,"December 24, 2019",5," Great app, I'm very much dedicated towards playing acoustic guitar since it is one of my hobby and this app is really helpful to me."
2130,Daniel Jimenez,"December 23, 2019",5, Great for a beginner. It's only a few bucks. You'll spend alot more on a teacher anyway so why not. Especially if you've already spent the money on a guitar.
2131,alan forbes,"December 31, 2019",1, In the last year it's practically unusable. Ever since the automatic adds came in. Searches run like a pig and take over what I'm trying to see. Used to be excellent. Shame.
2132,Drummar Boy0722,"January 20, 2020",1," When i got my new phone, i tried downloading the app onto my new one. It refuses to move past the customization screen after I've filled in my preferences, despite restarting and uninstalling, then reinstalling the app."

2138,Patrick Musselwhite,"December 24, 2019",5, Great App. Many different versions of songs by different artists. Allows you to choose a version that most closely matches your ability.
2139,Uhh BOI,"November 20, 2019",5, For someone out of practice for a long time this is honestly the best thing on the app store to quickly and easily find perfect tabs to learn songs the right way!
2140,Drip,"November 27, 2019",1," Every time I would try to look up the cords for a song, the dumb ass free trial ad would pop up, and when i press back it would exit out the song i want to play."
2141,Ben Loveday,"November 26, 2019",5," I've used the UG website for years, and this app is a great extension of it. Really handy for wannabe players like me, with tons of great tabs and other content."
2142,Lee Cherry,"November 24, 2019",5, Long time user of the site. This app just feels like an extension of the content and community. The free app is fine. The paid version has some real handy features.

2146,Rory Lomax,"December 20, 2019",4," Vary good im thrill at how braude the social sectrum. While variety which does keep you busy...

2148,Andrei Iepure,"December 29, 2019",5, Thanks UG! Finally got a phone that can support your app. I love it. Your tabs taught me how to play guitar. Thanks for the hard work! Keep it up
2149,James Rizza,"December 21, 2019",1, Wish i can give it no stars. It makes you pick which types of music you like. And then it asks you to pick which songs and i don't like any of them. Every time i log on it shows me a ton of garbage I don't want or like. Thank you for wasting my time.
2150,Frank Luna,"January 1, 2020",1," The old approach straight to the songs and chords was way better, now you need to follow lots of steps to access a song. Not a fan."
2151,Zachary Adams,"January 11, 2020",5, The pro feature helped me learn so many songs while understanding how to count and subdivide and read rhythm. Not just the tabs while trying to figure out the rest.
2152,Jim Temple,"January 11, 2020",5, This is my go to site everytime i play new or old music which i want to learn or relearn. Have recommended to others. Keep up the great work.
2153,Mo Kachu,"January 14, 2020",5," It's not perfect but it will get you started in a direction to have fun. I love the ""pro"" amenities it's been worth it to me for many years and I use it all the time."

2158,pjster23,"November 19, 2019",5, It had been a long time since I picked up my guitar. I was blown away by the selection. You will find a lot here that you never would have guessed they would have the tabs/chords for.
2159,Kelly Murray,"November 25, 2019",5, Great app. Lots of variety to search. Easy printing when required. Like using the links to listen to versions within the app.
2160,Jannik Petersen,"January 27, 2020",2, I can't save as pdf (fails) and uninstall does not help. The app logs me in automatically and the error remains. Update : I have sent a mail with a screenshot
2161,Hakan Bacon,"January 27, 2020",5, This piece of software is the bets addition to every musician even including other instruments than just guitars. I even payed for the pro version for its features and I belive this is my favorite app ever. Nice work gugs!

2166,Ian Urquhart,"December 5, 2019",2, Spams you like crazy with up sell after up sell. Everytime I open the app. I'm pretty sure I even spent money once thinking it would remove the spam at start up. It did not.
2167,Zeke Keller,"December 16, 2019",5," This app is gonna rock, I've been learning and teaching myself the terms of the guitar, practicing chords, hand placement, and strumming and now with this app I can practice and learn to play songs."

2172,Sanjana Attanayake,"December 24, 2019",5, Best guitar app to get the chords..... Really worth purchasing it completely.....Most of the time it is in the original key so it is really easy to play along with the song 👌👌👌👌
2173,Daniel P,"December 29, 2019",1," The ""automatic paid subscription immediately after free trial without notice"" model is pretty scummy, especially when you cant even use the app at all unless you subscribe."
2174,Marshall Goldfarb,"December 21, 2019",1, Used to be a flat rate (which I previously paid for) now they charge a monthly fee. Go to e-chords through google...where you can still get free tabs and chords.
2175,Sheetal Jain,"January 10, 2020",5, It's exceptional. Just the app you need if you're learning guitar or not able to remember so many chords. Hehe.
2176,victor torres,"January 20, 2020",5," This is an amazing app, the tonebridge part of it is awesome, all you need is an iRig for $10 and you get tons of effect pedals for free!"
2177,Reinaldo Rodriguez,"January 24, 2020",5, I love this app i've learned a ton of songs this app has a pretty impressive catalog.. My daughter also uses it to sing along while i play if i wasnt so broke i would definitley do the paid verion but either thanks for such an awsome app

2181,Shannon McWatters,"March 24, 2020",5," Ties to google fast, every song available!! This is the first paid app I wasn't disappointed by. It ties in to Google searches while you are juicing and jamming with the crew ,,♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️"

I give 3 stars for the courtesy of not assassinating me, take away 1 star for finagling this rating process by wording the question in an unclear way, and take away another star for wasting my time. I have had this app before and its wonderful, but if I give you my credit card number and am immediately asked to do something else (this) then you are never gonna get any real feedback on the app. So heres 1."
2187,dr kh,"November 29, 2019",5," Simple interface, easy to navigate, and wide variety of song. Worth the subscription."
2188,louie salinas,"November 27, 2019",5, Great asset when can't find the right note! Excellent selection of songs! Many songs I did not expect to find tab for.
2189,Andrew Bennett,"December 24, 2019",5," This app is a wonderful tool for all things music. Not just guitar tabs, but a community. And a vast database of logged tabs."
2190,Greg C,"December 22, 2019",5," Awesome app, been a big fan for yrs, watched it grow, from the early days, awesome work guy's, love how it keeps getting better and better."
2191,Robert Ciaschini,"January 8, 2020",5," So far, I'm learning faster with this very accurate tab program. Not all notes ring out during a Pantera solo, however. Well done."
2192,Anthony Couzens,"January 8, 2020",5, Got shown this by a mate and can't put it down. Simple and harder versions plus play along with videos of the music and let it scroll as you play. Magic!
2193,amy roosien,"January 17, 2020",5, Im just beginning and this is a great help. Love the auto scroll and that you can listen to the song right from the app!
2194,Ashutosh Kataria,"January 23, 2020",5, I've used this app for years and hats off to the developers. this app made me able to play most of my favourite songs on the acoustic and made me so happy and more confident. thanks guys i highly appreciate it! love you all :D
2195,Cord Linam,"January 25, 2020",4, Not all of the tabs are accurate but that's not really the developer's fault. I like that your screen won't time out while on a tab.
2196,christina knopp,"January 26, 2020",5, I love every feature! From the auto scroll to the fact that I can edit and save a personal copy! Thank you thank you thank you!
2197,Matthew Gibes,"February 1, 2020",5," Great tabs app, very user friendly. Kinda like Wikipedia in the sense that anyone can make/edit a tab."
2198,Steve Williams,"February 2, 2020",4, I am finding the chord sequence needs to be adjusted in more and more songs lately
2199,stephen leech,"March 13, 2020",5," First song I wanted to learn took no time with these guys . Happy man . Never stop learning . Get,s better every time I refermilia my self with the best songs in the world . Thank you ."

2202,Carole Grandchamp,"March 20, 2020",5, Love that you can adjust the app to your needs and playing 🎉🎊
2203,Kevin Casey,"April 22, 2020",5," Awesome, making guitar fun again."
2204,Jessica Wells,"December 21, 2019",5, Not the best for ukulele chords but perfect if you play guitar. Also you have to pay for pretty much all features.
2205,Barbi Ann,"November 10, 2019",5," Always there when you need it whether you are looking for tabs, chords or need sound. Love this app."
2206,Justin Strange,"November 15, 2019",5, Has been and always will be the best. Thw Free 7 day trial will show you its Totally worth the annual price. 10/10 will use it daily again.
2207,Shane Davis,"November 23, 2019",1," I can't blame them for wanting to monetize this resource. We all gotta get by. It has just been a pretty aggressive reduction in the usability of the app if you don't go Premium. Sorry, folks, I can't justify the cost of it for myself. I'm out."
2208,Mary Turner,"November 25, 2019",5, Super easy to navigate and extremely helpful in learning tabs. I'm just now learning and I absolutely love it.
2209,Ryanna Malig,"November 26, 2019",5," U can find so many different kinds of songs and genres, u can record urself and post on ur own story, they give u optional tabs and they also make the chords easy for the beginner guitarist"
2210,Trent Hewton,"December 8, 2019",4, Good. But very very slow. Also the autoscroll doesn't account for the bottom bar on the tab screen making it very hard to use.
2211,James Owings,"December 8, 2019",5, Love this app. As a beginner of just over a year I can find plenty of easier songs I can learn and play. Thank you so much for this very excellent app.
2212,Colten Pilipchuk,"December 14, 2019",4, I love the app but on my galaxy s9 whenever there is a time change the visual tabs go out of sync with audio. Oddly enough it works good on my older Asus phone.
2213,Carl Baugher,"December 14, 2019",2, Horrible wouldn't stop trying to charge my debit card until it overdrafted me. I didn't even want this app past the trial and I only used it one night and didn't like what I experienced
2214,Truckadero Neal,"January 1, 2020",4," Love this app. But, i can't get any sound when i try the tab player. Just updated to the latest update. Using on a Samsung S9."
2215,Brian Armstrong,"December 30, 2019",5," About as good as it gets. Some tabs are way off, but that's to be expected, considering the nature of the app! The app itself is first rate!"
2216,Nickolas Dozier,"December 24, 2019",5, Honestly one of my favorite ways to learn how to play guitar. After years of not playing and picking it back up this was super helpful
2217,Noel Gaikwad,"December 24, 2019",5, This is best because it provides us all the essential chord for any song and with professional. By practicing here you can be a professional guitarist.
2218,Misty Fogarty,"December 28, 2019",3," Great app .., but cost too much for pro. I just simply can't afford to put 20 bucks on my phone for an app for a year of access....."
2219,Saurabh Srivastava,"December 24, 2019",2, Maybe good..Deleted because its a paid app..2 stars because I still have to give credit numbers for subscribing free..If somehow i m not able to cancel money gets deducted for sure. Received ur reply..still its tricky..not hassle free..Thanks fr replying back
2220,A Beautiful Perfect Dove,"December 30, 2019",3," The live tabs don't always play the lead guitar sounds, which is very helpful to hear especially with a tricky solo. Needs fixing"
2221,Kameron Mietlinski,"January 12, 2020",1," I payed a premium price awhile ago and now I'm locked out behind another paywall, do not get this app, it will just swallow your money while being just an okay guitar learning app"
2222,Chiara Jordan,"January 14, 2020",5," Its Awesome! I mean all of my favorite songs were there, mostly love songs. As a 14 year-old girl, its so fast to learn."
2223,Tini Cupcake,"January 12, 2020",5," Because of this site I learned guitar, it has been nothing but great over the years especially now in app format. Thanks always."
2224,Skylar Clemons,"January 14, 2020",2, Good tabs! Very difficult to navigate the app through all the ads. Can't seem to escape being asked to upgrade to premium every 2 minutes
2225,Sarah MacHattie,"January 24, 2020",5, Great has everything you want including auto scroll so no stopping to turn pages or struggling to keep your place and also has key change button to save us all the hassle.
2226,Kyndell Steen,"January 27, 2020",5, learned how to play guitar from this app. would recommend to anyone wanting to learn songs while learning guitar instead of just reading a boring book the whole time.
2227,RwSmith,"April 1, 2020",5, Thank you guys for the consistent work & improvements to this great app
2228,mama jessa,"March 30, 2020",5, So convinient to use.. Hope i could use it for free in 1month.. Thanks anyway

2230,Justin Fankell,"November 17, 2019",5, Got the free trial and forgot to cancel and didnt use it they charged me $20 for a year of pro.......checked it out after ..not disappointed at all glad ive got it very useful
2231,AJ White,"December 14, 2019",5," Been using this app since I've had an iPhone, and I haven't had an iPhone for about 4 years. I was upset when my Lifetime of Pro or whatever it's called was only on iPhone but then you guys added it so there is no reason to complain. Thank you guys so much."
2232,Grimmjow,"December 15, 2019",1," Bug in the shots, sometimes when I stop the record or discard it, it exits the app and the video goes uploading and stuck in the progress."
2233,Rahul Nainawat,"January 2, 2020",1, Please reverse the subscription and transfer the amount back in my account. I don't need any subscription you spammed my account and money got transferred without any authentication and approval.
2234,Henry L Frisby II,"January 6, 2020",5, Great app so far. Only downside is the backing tracks are not as professional as i would like! Over all great app!
2235,Seb Johnson,"January 8, 2020",1," Only downloaded because they make the website nearly unusable on phone, full of adds, slow and clunky, I wouldn't mind it so much if they didn't push it on you so hard"
2236,Roman Guerrero,"January 11, 2020",5, Its a great app that helps you learn to play the songs you enjoy. The pro purchase is also worth it in my eyes as well.
2237,Harrison Lowe,"January 21, 2020",5, I love this...best app for performers and beginners alike. As a self taught muso i only read chords n hear notes so this makes it easy. Now I perform frequently 😆 Cheers
2238,Jesse Gutierrez,"January 30, 2020",4, I wish there were some sort of tutorial or something for complete beginners. Some of the symbols and chord progressions don't make much sense to me.
2239,Rocksmith 2014 player1,"February 3, 2020",5, I enjoy the app with the songs and also all the different playing arrangments thanks ultimate guitar.
2240,Mubin Mansor,"February 4, 2020",5, It's awesome and u could learn how to play your favourite song with simple chords.
2241,miguel panta,"April 12, 2020",5, essential for guitarists
2242,Simply Mary,"April 14, 2020",5, I love the website and I love the app!
2243,The_kiler_goose,"January 1, 2020",4, The app is good and a useful tool but some features are missing and the ui is not the best out their. Edit 1: the app forced a 5 star so I had to edit it to what i thought was fair.
2244,Toby Holland,"January 15, 2020",5, best app ever . has all my favorite songs .. i been playing 27 years an this app has been the greatest library i ever seen thanks to all whom had part in making this app a blessing . an we thank you Jeff steiburge most of all for making this freaking happen . .ROCK ON .....
2245,Evelyn T,"November 11, 2019",3," Good for looking up tabs and chords, but a ridiculous amount of ads and restricted features if you dont buy the ""pro"" version"
2246,Nathan Avendano,"November 15, 2019",5, Awesome. This app has come a long way from when it first started. The self record and post is great.
2247,Brian Kellett,"November 19, 2019",5," Easy to use, amazing library, friendly and fun. A no brainer choice for the noodling novice, or accomplished player."
2248,Brayan Arias,"November 20, 2019",5," Great app, i can search all kinds of notes on any of my devices and even when i dont have wifi or signal i can still use the ones i already have."
2249,reece vocal2017,"November 25, 2019",5," I use the website more than app. But as i have picked up my old guitar again, im going to use the app a whole lot more. Awsome app guys....keep up the good work!"
2250,Andrew Harper,"November 28, 2019",1, Can't transpose unless you buy the full version! Tons of ads at EVERY step pulling up a song. NOT worth downloading it in any way.
2251,Jacob Ferguson,"December 7, 2019",1," Its a pay to play. Its like EA, they release something cool then you have to pay after you spend time downloading and making an account."
2252,Jr Rocha,"December 12, 2019",5," Love this app, great variety and with all the options there always a version that you'll love for any song. Great job guys and thanks!"
2253,John Theron,"December 16, 2019",5, A great app with more than 1 option for each song. Really great for all levels of guitarist.
2254,Drake Miller,"December 20, 2019",4, This app is really good and taught me how to play all my favorite songs but I think there should be more features available to people without a subscription
2255,nathan dez,"December 24, 2019",5, I started learning acoustic guitar and needed an app to help. This app was by far the best I found to really teach me the skills & songs I wanted.
2256,Daniel Eastwood,"December 21, 2019",1, Has become more and more about advert pop-ups. Can't even have it open up to the home screen without an ad insisting you upgrade.
2257,Matt Holbrook,"December 24, 2019",5," Used this app for years and if and when (rarely) there are bugs, tech support always respond when you report the errors and get them fixed swiftly"
2258,Skyler Hooper,"December 24, 2019",4," Great but sometime sync is not on. I also found quite a few tabs on other apps that this doesnt have, the other apps are also cheaper..."
2259,Corbin Cox,"December 25, 2019",5, I like being able to update something if you feel it's more accurate and get really good tabs and sheet music.
2260,Francisco José Salvatierra López,"January 1, 2020",5, Great job! You can actually tell this app has been made by people who understands what is it to learn playing guitar.
2261,Judy Limsan,"January 14, 2020",5, It really helps me a lot simplifying to the easiest chords I can use to play my favorite songs. Great.
2262,Jack Gawthorne,"January 16, 2020",2," Cant review tabs, most of which are formatted poorly.(reviews on app must be over 10 words, as soon as i go over 10 words the submit button is broken)"
2263,Fergus McCormack,"February 2, 2020",5, Simple and easy to understand great for learning and enhancing your playing ability
2264,Refracti0n B312,"January 30, 2020",5," Always nice to have access to massive song library, and even though it has ads for free users, there at least guitar related."
2265,Mikko Liukko,"March 7, 2020",5, Great app could you integrate Google play music

2274,Gabe SD,"November 29, 2019",5," Tools, personal tabs, chord lists and progressions; this is a good all in one app and a welcome addition to my library."
2275,Lemon & Lime,"December 5, 2019",1, It sucks. Can't find one song without having to pay to use. The app itself is great but having to pay ruins it.
2276,Rocket Scientist,"December 11, 2019",1," Terrible, uninstalled immediately. So many ads I can't function at all. This is mind numbingly stupid."
2277,Sgt Music,"December 25, 2019",5, I love this app. When ever my kids say dad can you play that song? I boot up your app and in a few minutes we are singing along. I love it and it helps me connect with my family and friends.
2278,Aakash Dere,"December 29, 2019",4," Very good and simple to understand, but would've been better if some features were available in basic pack"
2279,Yaumil Fajri,"December 21, 2019",4," I gave 5 stars cuz sometimes the ''listen'' feature is glitchy, and sometimes the app is crashed because of that. But overall this app is really good."

2281,Chris McBride,"December 24, 2019",4, Best app Iv seen so far just browsing the basic part on the verge of getting a paid membership . Easy to use and understand.
2282,Peter Ronney,"December 31, 2019",1," Unless you want to pay for everything, this is not your app. Free version is useless. Payed for version looks nice."
2283,Dylan Barker,"January 7, 2020",5, Love the app long time guitar player but not the best to admit. But I greatly enjoy this app as it encourages and helps me to learn!
2284,Cory Smith,"January 9, 2020",5," Awesome app, basically songsterr meets facebook, but with a much better interface. A must have for anyone who learns through tabs."
2285,Julia,"January 8, 2020",5," It gives you the chords that sound really well, the only annoying this is when you can't use the chords cuz they are like special or for premium but that's okay idc"
2286,Nicholas Hull,"January 14, 2020",5, Been using Ultimate guitar for almost 10 years now. Has never failed me. Thank you guys so much for this gem.

2294,Jim Creson,"November 18, 2019",5," great app and great charts! Every time I look for something here, I find it and it is generally correct! Fine stuff! UPDATE: this is the BEST OF ITS KIND!"
2295,jimmy prick,"January 5, 2020",5, Very helpful and easy to get around the app but most importantly the talent is plentiful and inspirational which helps alot when in that creative rut ...
2296,irigia bowman,"November 16, 2019",5, Wonderful. Cool suggestion if you add the ability to look at chods while recoding shots that would be neat. All n all wonderful app allways my go to for chords plus.
2297,Kiwikillabot2810,"December 11, 2019",4," Great app, Wish they would increase selfie videos to two minutes instead of one minute. Hence the four stars instead of five."
2298,Chris Bullers,"December 26, 2019",3," I like this app and even bought premium, but it's causing my phone to use all battery and even get hot, have no idea why."
2299,Red Angeles,"December 22, 2019",5, Good stuff. Great way to build a repertoire of songs. Wouldn't wanna rely too much on it though.

2303,Johanna Mangerud Gyllenvik,"January 29, 2020",4, Amazing but too expensive and too necessary to pay for the full version since the free version doesn't give you much to work with
2304,V. P,"January 30, 2020",5," It's library is really good, and a lot of choices and features to accomplish to play your favorite songs in 🎸 ."
2305,Alara Silvio,"January 30, 2020",5," Totally love it! People there are nice, the tabs are good, and there's a social media aspect to it!"

2316,Heath Lane,"December 10, 2019",1, Continually freezes and crashes. Don't get more than 15 minutes of use before this happens.
2317,Carlton Miller,"December 12, 2019",5, Luv the app. I played bass for years. Now Im trying to play guitar... This app is very helpful. Thanks

2324,larry white,"November 15, 2019",5, My experience has been good except when I altered a song posted it and you kept sending me notice to complete it. I'm not a song writer but I added a verse because I liked the sound of it so to me it was finished. I don't know what else to do. Give me feed back and maybe I can finish it.
2325,ruben castillo,"November 26, 2019",5," It's a great app to learn, guitar chords and learn the words the songs..Thank you for this great app ."

I thought I had cancelled it, but when the term expired the subscription auto-renewed. I immediately contacted UG and they took 2 days to refer me to google. By then Google's 48hr policy expired and said I had to contact UG for a refund. UG says there's nothing they can do since it was purchased through google play. Right....pretty sure if goggle tells me to contact UG, UG can do something. $20 rip off..."

3927,Tave Tavern,"February 28, 2020",1, I thought I was going to get a free app but at the end the personalization it asks you how long you you'd like to pay. Just go on YouTube and look up on how play what you want to play
3928,Ginabella Shipper,"March 7, 2020",3," Not what I wanted, it just keeps telling me about the trial without letting me do anything. Even if it's good overall, remove those reminders then I'll give a 5"
3929,Bill Hughes,"March 7, 2020",5, Great app very impressed.
3930,MultiMidge,"March 24, 2020",2," It gives you the chords, but you have to pay or something to get the tabs. I'd have to go on a separate window to get the tabs. It would be easier to just tap on it!!"
3931,Sourav Kanti Bag,"March 24, 2020",5, Really a useful app.
3932,troyk541,"March 26, 2020",1," Free version is not very useful. Update: I can get tabs and everything else you mentioned online already without the app. Therefore, it's not very useful to me."
3933,Zolo Csanda,"November 5, 2019",3," The app is fine, however even though I have given it three or for shots, it's still more convenient for me to use the free webpage than this. Compared to their website, the app has more ads and it takes me longer to find the cords for the song I want to learn."
3934,Bret Haskins,"November 28, 2019",5, Fun and user friendly!
3935,Carmen Gaona,"November 25, 2019",5, This app is awesome! So easy to use!
3936,Nicolás A. Fantone,"December 14, 2019",2," Absurd app size (70+ MB). Very sluggish. Unacceptable loading times for stuff that can be display in a simple .txt file. Constantly shoveling ads and buying options in your face. It's a shame because, when it works, the song collection the community has put together is pretty great."
3937,Mark Schroeder,"December 16, 2019",5, Great app for learning guitar 👌👌👌

3943,Marcus Martillano,"March 26, 2020",1, I really can't do anything with this app. It always prompts me to buy the pro version when I don't even want it. I can't even view chords of the songs I want to play and even the chord library. This sucks.
3944,Nadeesh Bhardwaj,"March 31, 2020",1," Nothing in the app without subscription (nothing means nothing, not even metronome and tuner), well the chords and tabs( that you can anywhere on web) are also just of average kind in this app Better download yousician"

3961,Emilio Patrick,"March 26, 2020",1," Is just bad. App takes to long to load, is hard to navigate and is buggy. They give you ads for premium whenever you tap the screen. Better off using google and websites"
3962,MALIK Helou,"April 6, 2020",1, Very bad its not free
3963,Gooday,"April 20, 2020",2, Pop ups and adverts. Yawn. Well the actual website doesn't have pop ups forcing you to wait before seeing any information so this makes the app redundant.
3964,Mert TURKOGLU,"November 15, 2019",5, Great app for reference and improvement

3967,No one Of Consequence,"November 6, 2019",3," It's a good service... But only if you pay for it. (They paywall everything) but if you do pay, it has alot of nice features. I personally wouldn't have bought it if they didn't offer introductory pricing. Expensive but premium I guess."
3968,Owen Fisher,"November 9, 2019",4, Excellent app to get anyone started or to remember the cords to a song. Wish it did a better job at suggesting songs for me. That would make it 5 stars. But all they do is recommend pop songs that I don't listen to and don't care to play.
3969,Jay H.,"November 11, 2019",5," Very good, the autoscroll is really handy to keep your hands free, the first version you click on of song may not be the best for your needs or the most accurate but you can usually find a good version when there are multiples of the same song."
3970,Phil McG,"November 18, 2019",2, The inability to share playlists with other paying customers is ridiculous. I got 3 other guys in a project to sign up because I thought we'd be able to collaborate on repertoire. Surely this couldn't be hard to do. People been asking for it for years.

3976,Merlin Robertson,"February 7, 2020",1, I fully agree with Mr.Roy Allen. There are ads or an attempt to sell one the premium app at every turn. No point in using this app when the webpage works heaps better.

3978,Jonathan Wilson,"February 29, 2020",1," Loaded. Then had to select preferences, wasting my time, only to tell me after all that that I have to pay to use the app. Tell me up front before I start downloading. It's not about having to pay, I think that's reasonable, it's about being up front about that."
3979,Jessica Kate,"March 21, 2020",1, Paid Service. No fingerstyle available. Useless. Don't waste your time unless you want to pay $20 per month for crappy tabs and chords.

4046,James Wells,"December 30, 2019",1," I rarely give 1 star reviews, but an app that literally requires you to pay to access everything despite being 'free' just isn't worth it. It's not really very expensive but the week long trial just isn't enough to make a good judgement on the app."

4056,Brian M,"January 18, 2020",1," This app was alright for posting short clips of songs you've learned or finding tabs, but now you can't even use the tuner on this app without signing up for their premium subscription. NOT worth your time or money, find an alternative!"

4066,Jimmy Roo,"April 24, 2020",2," I'm sure the app is fine. Not for me, it's one of many groups that offers these services and the fee is affordable but why pay when it's free?"
4067,JRA M,"April 26, 2020",1, You can learn guitar chords and songs without spending money. No need to download this app and pay for pro version. Money suckers.
4068,Anna G,"November 4, 2019",4, I have to admitt the app is very good. It would be even better if they also have a piano chords to play together with other people. The only disadventage is the price.... Because of that I am not sure if I am going to extend for another year.
4069,Joshua Ang,"November 24, 2019",5, A must have for guitar players!
4070,grog enstein,"January 14, 2020",5," Simply the best music tab/sheet music guitar and bass teaching tool besides a teacher....ever! As a metal musican the amount of old school death/thrash bands that are available is just awesome! Not to forget,my classic country roots either! The selection and tabs uploaded by users makes the app👍"
4071,Scumlicek,"February 1, 2020",1, Chord variations are now behind a pay wall?!? I understand charging more for additional features but removing functionality? Not cool. Uninstalled.
4072,Sam Go away,"February 7, 2020",1," Way to many ads, and you have to pay to get the most popular tabs. You could have banner ads instead"

4086,elzip bb,"January 27, 2020",3, I'd love to use it. But you have to subscribe i.e. too much money for me to use it. Not like Facebook etc. to which they make a reference to in the description. Otherwise great. No Ads because of monthly payment.
4087,Jenna Wiesing,"February 2, 2020",5," Thanks for the update! I've been waiting for tab creation! Heck yes, and you fixed the tab editing problem I was having! 5 stars!"

4098,Gregory Stuart,"January 9, 2020",1, Sham. It's not even close to free. They give you a week and then want to try was you monthly. There are plenty of apps that provide chords and tabs for free. I deleted this application once I saw it was nothing but a big sales pitch.
4099,Jesse Armiger,"January 11, 2020",5," I use this every single day. It's obvious that they are working to improve the end-user experience and have succeeded in a very tangible way. It's simple enough that anyone can use it, but if you're a lover of theory intracacy and nuance, I've yet to find the limits."

They continually update the interface while keeping the feel the same. The developers clearly don't try to make it something it isn't, and they have a boatload of Christian music (even the less well known stuff) on there, which is amazing to me. It's great if you know tablature or if you mostly just play-by-ear. I waited way too long to get the pro version - trust me, it's honestly worth it (and I'm super cheap, haha). Thank you guys for making my music journey to reach others for the Lord Jesus so much easier! Blessings and Shalom in Christ ♡"

When they released this app I was all over it, and if you play guitar then you should be too! Forget expensive lessons, teach yourself. Not good at being self taught? Pretty sure they have video/tab lessons for a small monthly fee. Simply put, you can't afford to pass up on this app, the potential is limitless."

I tried it's one week free subscription and thought i could try and get access to the app's song libraries but no, it was very buggy and crashed a lot of times. Some of the songs that are in their catalog doesnt show up. It could have been a great app if it wasnt full of ads and prompt you to buy its full version on every single action you do."

I used to be able to open the app and quickly get to a song I wanted to learn, but now every other screen is an advertisement and greatly slows down the process. Luckily, I've come to a point where I can learn mostly from ear, but if I was still just starting out, I'd avoid this app like the plague."

Compared to the PC version of the page the app is far more restrictive, buggy, and you can tell minimal effort was made to port it over to mobile. The app often gets stuck in an endless loop when you try and open any tab which requires premium, forcing you to restart. It's extremely difficult to zoom in and out on tabs. You can't press the names of artists to see other songs they have tabbed, and there are a couple other inconveniences in the app which could easily be fixed but aren't."

Haha I've used the free version for years, and I've always been hesitant to make the purchase for the pro version. Trust me, it's well worth the investment if you're a real musician that gets tired of playing the same songs and wants to escape that plateau that we all get stuck on occasionally. If I had two extra hands I would give this app 4 thumbs up. Great job guys. I just finished learning ""Thank You,"" by Led Zep, and so it seemed ironically appropriate to give y'all thanks. Keep up the good work, and ask me if I want a job! That would be epic :) Again, thank you for this amazingly convienent tool."

However, as a free app with an option to upgrade it totally sucks. Why? because its functionality is interrupted at inopportune moments with very obnoxious advertising that has no way of getting around it other than subscribing or participating in a free trial. if you are unwilling to pay for an annual or monthly subscription, your best option with Ultimate-Guitar is to use it from the website rather than the app as there are more features accessible there. Using the app without paying a subscription will only frustrate you and make you angry at the developers for making it this way, as it has me.

4165,Sirius Black,"January 21, 2020",5, Such a good app! Any song you can think of they have. Official tabs/chords or fan made tabs/chords. They also added a feature where you can record your own video and upload it. Totally worth getting the subscription.

Anyway: The app works very well from what I've experienced. No bugs to complain about so far. I love all the extra personalization features that they've added in, like saving specific tabs, the ability to create playlists, etc.. I obviously wish that there wasn't a premium fee for all of this stuff, but I understand that they gotta make money so I can't very well hold that against them. Overall it's a brilliant app, and I'm glad Ultimate-Guitar is still prevalent in the music scene. My only legitimate complaint is the quantity of ads. And how persistently they try to persuade you into purchasing the premium access stuff."

First of all, unlike on the web app where there are both transpose and pitch functions, on the Android app there is only transpose. When you choose transpose the chord names change, which while technically correct, is not the way guitarists think. They think of the chord SHAPE that they have to play, not the actual chord pitch. On the web, the workaround is to use pitch (which doesn't change the chord names) instead of transpose, but that function doesn't exist on the Android app. Minus one star for that.  Second, it is really confusing to understand how to make each instrument of the several in a song play. What are S and M? Where are the instructions?  Also, when in chords mode, the timing seems off, as if the app is freezing briefly and then continuing. It may be that the app is a resource pig and is sucking up all the memory on my tablet, but that should not be the case.   Three stars is generous."

Also just a click of a button and a little screen pops up with the youtube video, so you can play and listen to the original song at the same time. The one suggestion I do have is searching for songs is a little annoying. This is because every single time you search a new song you have to filter for the instrument you want to play. It defaults to guitar, if you play ukulele or piano you will have to filter every time you search."

EDIT: Advertisements on the boarder of the app, ads between any tab that is tapped. At this point I am ok with the level of advertisements.

A trick for those who actually want to use the site without the trouble of this god-awful app switch your phone browser to desktop mode where the ads are built in normally.  If these guys wanted to fix their application they would limit the ads to a USABLE level where ads can be seen but not interfere with the quality of the app's performance.

In addition, I have been using this for more than a year and it greatly fits for my guitar lesson (even in ukalele) and practice with the praise and worship team in our church (Bambang Evangelical Church). Kudos to the developers of this app. God bless to all of you."
4415,Rob McAuliffe,"December 3, 2019",5, Sadly I am having the same problem with the red bar being off the screen. Also every tab now opens on chords instead of pro. Still 5 stars but would like these small issues fixed. Thanks.
4416,Stockwood Praise,"November 2, 2019",5, Really good way to get chords for songs. Change keys easily. Lots of useful songs available. Only rarely do I find that the songs I need are missing.
4417,B Christian,"November 25, 2019",5," Amazing app, the tutorials and lessons are super helpful and joining the mailing list was the icing atop the awesome cake. Everyday I recieve a new lesson & updates on deals and new gear. 5/5 stars for Ultimate Guitar 🙌🏾🖤"
4418,Mark Kamoski,"November 29, 2019",5," Amazing app now. Tons of features. Extremely useful. It needs to add transpose support for ALL songs which it lacks now (2019-NOV), but it is still great now as is. Thanks."
4419,J Rockwizzle,"December 2, 2019",5, This app is what you need for any stage of playing. Whether you've played for 20 days or 20 years. It is a master tool in the art of music. Five stars. All day long!

4423,the beats bizarre,"December 20, 2019",1, Terrible amount of adverts.... Having huge pictures of mince pies popping up or big sofas you cannotafford in the middle of a song you are trying to sing does not help.... Paywalls everywhere.... Going back to my browser version... Ultimate fail!
4424,Don Park,"December 31, 2019",1, No easy way to just get what I want. Initial onboarding requires unskipable steps required for personalization. Even then the final tab I wanted was behind a paywall. I just got rid of it.
4425,Teddy Nedelcu,"December 28, 2019",1, Lmao it's just some adware thing. You can't even see any chords without paying. Pretty dumb in my opinion... Considering the countless free alternatives. I suggest you use literally anything else.

4754,John Russ,"January 15, 2019",3," A lot of transcripts tend to be off just enough to get annoying. However, as a guitarist who strives to be better, viewing it as a creative tool, it helps open your eyes to other options for musicality. Try to improve the data base. Not everyone listens to ""Pop"" music."

Back then, the website was fantastic and groundbreaking. the app, on the other hand, has not been fulfilling. The app has considerable lag time and ads that take up visual space on tablature. the framework fails to provide continuous guitar education due to profit seeking architecture."
4756,A Google user,"December 27, 2018",5," Really great app except the fact that some of the people who post songs on here are obviously clueless about the original song and put garbage in for their version. Not your fault, but I find it a lot and sometimes can't even find one correct version of the song! I'm babbling, great app, though"

All I can say is that guitar is life and no matter the stituation you know you have a guitar waiting to get played and an app waiting to take advantage from it. This has been an awesome Experience and through time I am progressing as a students perspective this is challenging but rewarding through time. Thank You! I look forward to some Hendrix !!

Don't be fooled by ratings of user contributed chords...some people are tired of using improperly 'timed'/incorrect lyric versions that have been available longer. I go through and play each version until it sounds right. I can find any song Im after, 99% of the time. Only complaint, too much contemporary lists and not enough root music (classics and obscure alike). Yes, I'm a Dead Head"
