3,Surinder Kumar,"April 26, 2020",1, Never use this for storing sensitive information. This is always accessed by hackers as well as its own employees seeking for ur data. I have got a message of paying dollars for my own data allegedly hacked by someone through this app.
4,Ayat Khrisat,"April 25, 2020",5, This is the first time I wrote a review for an app. I am Android developer and really amazed about what you done guys but can you please enhance image processing for handwriting it's hard sometimes to capture notes. love you Evernote

It has always been very okay--even with a paid subscription. It was the only option. But I've had a problem the entire time I've used it. If I use evernote across all of my devices (the only reason I use it) it constantly happens that an older version of a note on one device will sync as the most recent version, even though that device hasn't been synced in days. I lose days of information. If I have it on my computer and I didn't close it out and my computer is in sleep mode for a weekend and I've been using it on my phone throughout the weekend and I return to the computer and wake it up, that version of the notes syncs up and screws me out of the entire weekend's worth of data and updates. What kind of idiot programming allows it to think a note that hasn't been updated in two days on one device should override a note that has been constant use on another device. And why hasn't this been issue been dealt with after lord knows how many years evernote has been going. If your data is important and you are a regular user. Look for something else. I am. I'm so fed up I could spit. While I'm at it. The formatting is a crazy person. I can change the formatting for the whole note and then I'll delete a line and the formatting for everything after that will revert back to a previous formatting. Sometimes I'll be making a list and every line will be a larger font. It's seriously like the damn thing is drunk. It doesn't matter what device I use. It has always been an idiosyncracy I put up with because I didn't want to have to find something better."

They have no support contact (or at least I have not found it yet); the free version became unusable."

Cons: It is VERY glitchy! I have lost a full note multiple times due to glitches. Sometimes it says it's a duplicate error, other times it just deletes the whole note on me while I'm still typing it. I use it as a bridge between MAC and Android. My preference is iCloud notes because of how it ""just works"". Evernote does not ""just work"" in the way I wish it did."

There are some MAJOR flaws, if you have multiple businesses or personal account and business account, it is very grueling to switch between accounts, you will have to upgrade to premium very quickly. even if you upgrade to premium, it looks like you need to have premium for all of your accounts in order to switch back and forth and do more fluid sharing, which is outrageous $200+ per year.

20,William McKean,"April 17, 2020",3," One of the more useful apps, but I feel I was backed into a corner to pay for use on multiple devices. There, I said it. I rarely use it on devices other than my phone, but I like the option. Gut reaction when they did it, and haven't gotten over it, probably since I'm reminded each month."

31,Léia Caro,"April 11, 2020",4," In general it's a very good app for saving all sorts of content. The only thing that bothers me is how slow the app seems to perform at times, even when I just restarted my phone. Also, the space limit is restrictive, so maybe try to just save text notes there."

34,Josh McDonald,"April 13, 2020",4, Love the app. I would like to get the premium version but I don't think I would use it enough to warrant paying monthly or $26.00 a year. I got Diaro pro for a one time 6.97. it works with Evernote so that's pretty much the only time I need it

46,Sanzida,"April 3, 2020",3, It's a fairly good app . I just don't like the way they sort the notes. Would love if they added a calender feature so we can sort of use evernote to add data entries for a specific date if we want. Just way easier that way.

I use the scannable app primarily for work on an iPhone that is provided by my company.the problem is when the company phone breaks and I have to use my personal phone I have no way of faxing any information to the company for the pay roll department to do the billing for the jobs I have done. I would definitely use Evernote but not being able to utilize the version that they have on Apple with my phone

E.g note title should have site page title and content of note is just url with pic. Edit. Thanks for that. What about separated tags that exist only for a certain notebook.

55,Griffen Jacobsen,"March 23, 2020",3, Not bad. Just keep it updated. Couldn't access my notes for the last several weeks. Went to Playstore to post review and saw an update available. Problem solved. Poor communication of need to update and consequences for not updating. Really frustrating.

My only gripe is that for the number of paid subscribers ( including self) there has been little and minimal development over the last year or 2.

Bullets and numbered lists are brutal. It keeps overwriting every indented list bullet with the standard bullet, all fully left-aligned. And you can't just manually indent to fix it, you have to start your list again from scratch. Lists are the primary reason I use this app, and it does lists very poorly, so I don't have any use for this app anymore."

It's simplistic and easy to navigate without skimping on organization and editing tools. However, as soon as a note gets to a certain length, the app becomes unusable. It lags like I've never seen before and glitches the content typed, sometimes altogether forgetting and deleting strokes or entire words. As a writer, this renders the app wholly unusable as most of my notes are going to be long drawn-out ideas, characters, scenes, or even full chapters."
386,Steve,"January 10, 2020",2," I really like the platform when it's working. Unfortunately, it has been my experience that it rarely works properly, especially across devices.

527,Kris Peters,"March 6, 2020",5," My go to app for notes, short stories and poetry. Its instantly accessible to me everywhere. Love it!"
528,John Mann,"March 4, 2020",4," Terrific program for saving information. I'd rate 5 stars if it had better tabs, columns, and tables in the android version."
529,Nelson Menendez,"March 13, 2020",5," The app is easy to access and easy to use. You can type, voice record or voice dictate to the app."
530,John Doe,"March 15, 2020",1, Its a splash screen cant even log in
531,Laurens C,"March 11, 2020",3," The app is exceptionally good. But since the new update of Android 10.3.2. for my OnePlus 6, the edit bar above the type board has disappeared.... Please fix the bugs a.s.a.p."
532,Tom Boyd,"November 14, 2019",1," It's terrible, the way it pushes towards the premium version and how easy it is to sign up to, is the polar opposite of withdrawing from premium. I fell victim to the dubious practice of free trial, don't make my mistake. There are better services free from Google."
533,Christal M,"November 21, 2019",3," I don't know what's happened recently, but several of my notes are coming back as ""failed to upload"" stating the reason as they were ""created in a different app"". I have had Evernote for years, these are Evernote notes. I'm annoyed. Please fix this bug."
534,Schaddo Darkwall,"November 19, 2019",2," The app is good enough. If you want to use premium it'll cost you $8 a month. With all of the free options out there that have just as much functionality, paying a monthly cost is ludicrous. I can see paying like $10 one time but anything more is just too much for a note app."
535,Bryn Barker,"December 9, 2019",5," Pretty good note taking service, but way overpriced for what you get. App required reinstalling after upgrading to Android 10, but seems fine after that. Evernote has missed an opportunity to be the ubiquitous casual note app. In the long run I can see myself moving over to OneNote."
536,Dupe Ajayi,"February 26, 2020",4," Evernote is very versatile. i take sermon notes with it in church, store pictures of my travel documents and other means of identification. My information is readily st hand"
537,James Apple,"March 7, 2020",1, Stupid App when you try to take pictures for a note. The app doesn't care the order when you took pictures. The sequence just never be correct at all. What a dump app!!!!!
538,YueErn Teo,"March 8, 2020",5," It's very easy to use, the tagging system is awesome!!! And I really love the stack function."
539,Kevin Mascarenhas,"March 5, 2020",5, A really great app to keep everything organized the way you want. Used it for over 2 years now and love it!!!
540,Sharath Kumar,"March 31, 2020",1," Not responding or replying to our suggestions.thats why 1 star. Please add Repeation reminder option (Ex- daily, weekly, monthly)"
541,Get Inspired Flight,"November 18, 2019",5," While I still miss a real Linux version and so hunt around for a replacement every once in a while, I keep coming back to Evernote because it does what I need and Just Works, all without annoying ads and -- I'm trusting! -- a known pedigree and low probability of putting a hole in my phone."
542,V L,"November 28, 2019",3," The application is useful but they continuously take away basic functions like highlighting. They could do so much more with it, but I'm not sure why they brought it's development to a screeching halt and essentially told users, ""take it or leave it!"""
543,Sviatoslav Devdiuk,"December 3, 2019",2," Actually I'm facing a problem with desktop version (windows) but because your feature ""Send a ticket"" doesn't work (it's just offering to choose a topic and never showing a ticket for submission).So, desktop version doesn't synchronizing. Please contact me for I could send you activity log."
544,Peter DiIorio,"December 23, 2019",5, It's been a real boon to have an application where I can record notes and that spans multiple devices so notes are accessible almost anywhere and any time. I am sure that I am not utilizing all the capabilities of EverNote and am looking forward to exploring some more features.
545,LordofthePies,"January 16, 2020",3," Easy and clean to use, but I cant turn off notifications and I hate getting them. It also has a backup option that you have to pay for which it keeps shoving in my face. Fine enough on it's own, but I dont like a pushy app."
546,EDU-Time :Learn how to utilize time,"February 20, 2020",1," I have purchased premium membership and my money was deducted but I still don't have premium features, it's showing basic... I want my money back... Worst app I have ever seen..."

Premium is more expensive than what I used to have but I dont really need all those features. Just wasting my money I feel they also reduce the service for not premium subscription. I'm moving to onenote Hope others will do the same
549,Spencer Kraus,"December 3, 2019",5," Best app for keeping notes for anything. I have so much information on here from all sorts of different study topics, journals, random thoughts, lists, etc, and I can't imagine trying to organize everything I write down without it. Highly recommend for anyone with written documentation needs!"
550,Jake Woolley,"December 13, 2019",5, Great note/organisational app with many features. I've only got the free version and love it. I can't imagine how many things you could do with the upgraded version but I haven't needed it. Highly recommend.
551,Rozzi DidThat,"January 17, 2020",3," I like the cross platform, but I've written things on my phone just for the app to not save it for some reason, it crashes more than I would like as well. Other than that it's decent. I can't trust it fully though because of my previous not saving issue."
552,Lakshmi Mala,"February 15, 2020",2, Could not get premium through debit card . I try but only option to get premium is credit card. It irritates me lot. Plz make more Payment option to get premium.
553,Taylor Johnson,"February 26, 2020",2," I loved it until it started not letting me open notes saying they were ""unavailable"". Super annoying when I need to get into them. Definitely uninstalling"
554,Anne Kelly,"March 4, 2020",4," This app is great for a hoarder who needs to organize her many collections. Not me, of course, just a friend."
555,Darren Lauser,"April 2, 2020",3," OK, but too slow and clumsy. It would be better if it did less, and did it well."
556,John Bryan,"April 3, 2020",5, Great program for over 10 years now.
557,Saragh Penfold,"December 4, 2019",4," I use basic features organising my notes into notebooks. I use it all the time on my phone. Only use it for lists and saving articles, not long form writing. Appreciate being able to use it on PC as well, to tidy up. Predictive text isn't perfect."

I'm a hairstylist. I've started expanding to other life notes. I don't do any sharing or anything to elaborate with it. I have it on my tablet and phone since I need them both for work and do wish I could put it on my laptop without having to go premium. Hince only 4 stars.

Over 6 years of research and contemplation into a purpose and cause that runs deep within my heart and soul, has culminated in over 25,000 notes. With careful tagging, the outline and content for a set of books and resources that I am writing and creating, is a given .... I am so grateful to the Evernote team!"
560,Dick Crawford,"January 6, 2020",5," Easy to use and find notes. I like the sync feature across laptop, tablet and phone. Do not share with others as I am one man company. The ability to move files and photos into notes is a great feature."
561,D Wright,"December 24, 2019",5, Excellent organizing tool. It also provides excellent ways to chronicle your most important details of the day. This App allows the insertion of other documents relevant to what your whatever your documentation needs. I've used it for years and I love it!
562,Virginia Bush,"December 31, 2019",2, I used to love Evernote. Now each time I use the app the screen is blocked by an offer to upgrade with payment. I cannot unblock it and am no longer able to read my years of notes. The service says it's free but clearly is not anymore.
563,valeriu v,"January 20, 2020",3, I like this app and this concept but on web or Apple devices. Android version is so different from iOS where I can't make text heading or see them. The fact that design is very different from iOS version it doesn't matter so much but elements or functionality is important.
564,Nianya Hoel,"February 2, 2020",4," Good app but it needs more text editing options, i.e., more highlight colors, more font options and more paragraph formatting options."
565,SCLAVUS NUMEN,"February 7, 2020",1, Everything is forced upon in the app this days.. it annoying. They even attempted money deduction from my bank account after signing out and of my evernote account and uninstalling the app.
566,Belly 3tman,"February 15, 2020",4," Useful 😀 But we need repeat option like (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). Please Developer work on it."
567,Andrea Patterson,"March 6, 2020",5, Love Evernote. Conscious effort to use less paper. Don't have little post-its everywhere and it's all in one place. Love it!
568,Bernard Griffin,"November 14, 2019",5," Very good app. Only downside is I have difficulties switching personal and business email. Other than that, really smart app. Its able to read the information and I can search for specific key words rather than going through every note."
569,Rajesh Madugula,"November 26, 2019",4," Great job Evernote team. Sincerely appreciate your hard work. However one suggestion, ""note conflict between two devices"" is an old glitch and should have been dealt with long back. Apart from that, everything else is awesome. Thanks."
570,Bernard Ng,"December 3, 2019",4," Evernote has been a reliable cross-platform tool for information transfer. Some issues with the Android version at times in synchronsing. As a subscriber, one receives app advice on how to make the app work for you productively; you never get amazed at the improvements offered."
571,Calvin Seah,"December 30, 2019",3," Pretty good app if you want to have your noted sync across platform like Android, IOS ans MacOS. But why doesn't it allows hyperlink on mobile devices? I really don't understand, it can be so much more useful if that can be done."
572,Bill Boyd,"January 11, 2020",2," I've barley used it so I can't comment on actual usage but it sure has popped plenty of notifications, and sent me plenty of emails in two days The few times I have opened it, it's prompting me to upgrade to premium. Enough already..."

577,Alyx,"January 15, 2020",1, I was going to give Evernote another go. Then I read recent reviews. Holding data hostage? Not even minimal support for free version? Monthly fee for sub par ap & Support performance? Not acceptable. I will not support such unscrupulous behavior. Uninstalled.
578,Lina McDonald,"January 24, 2020",4," This is a great app. I use it everyday to joy down my thoughts, goals and ideas. I like being able to take it anywhere because I have it on my phone. When I have an idea for my story I can make a note of it before I forget."
579,Christopher Maina,"March 4, 2020",5, Excellent. Am able to keep track of all my information in one platform. The Book Do More Better by Tim Challies really gave great insight on how to organize my life using Evernote!

581,James Norquay,"December 14, 2019",4, Love using Evernote to organise all manner of notes for both work and recreation. The only issue I have encountered is that frequently when I share articles to Evernote from Google Chrome android they do not clip properly and I must repeat the process.
582,Brad Weber,"December 27, 2019",1," Notes are regularly unavailable on mobile. Uninstall/Reinstall doesn't help. Completely defeats the purpose of the program.

585,STEVE NEWTON,"January 14, 2020",4, This app has been a God send. It helps me keep track of so many different things. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is it doesn't have unlimited storage; however the basic plan can be upgraded to a plan that does. It has been cost prohibitive for me.
586,David Gurecki,"February 21, 2020",5, This has been the perfect app for writing a quick note. Whether that be a grocery list or an idea that just came to me.

591,Brian Frank,"January 18, 2020",5," As a lyricist, Evernote is an absolutely crucial app to have. Having access to notes from any device is a godsend, and Evernote is really well put together and easy to use. Constantly updating too. 10/10 love it"

This represents my primary use of this app. I have some friends who are also musicians/writers/performers and some of them are convinced that carrying around a notebook is somehow authentic. But they always eventually lose their notebooks, and then they complain to me, and then I have no sympathy, because I have already reccommended they get Evernote. So I do that again but then they still buy another notebook. Get this app. I'm talking to you, Brandon."
598,Matt Naylor,"December 3, 2019",5, I've always had trouble writing notes and paying attention to what is being taught in class. This app allows you to listen to what the teacher is saying then quickly scan the board when they are done writing. It made it so much easier to pay attention during lectures.
599,Adam Bland,"December 11, 2019",4," Excellent way to capture things as your day goes by, it would be nice if it had a more robust calendar function (it does have reminders you can set, but no calendar, per se.). The clipping tool is very good."

603,Nick Bodnariuk,"February 9, 2020",3, By taking notes on different devices with different OS you will end up with a bunch of different font families and sizes in same note. It's annoying.
604,Robert Williams,"February 15, 2020",1, Can't even copy from one app to Evernote. What's the point of a note taking app that is unable to use copy/paste.

606,Kestutis Sulcas,"January 16, 2020",4," Does everything it needs to for my purposes. Would rate five stars, but it sometimes bugs out and starts a new line of text only part way through the current line pretty frequently which is annoying to fix."

608,Shay Yellowbird,"November 11, 2019",5," I've been using Evernote for a few years now, and I haven't been disappointed with what you can do with it. Whether it be for work, school, or personal Evernote has a variety of templates to save virtually any kind of note!"
609,Robert Woodbeck,"November 10, 2019",3, Worked great til recently. Now the shortcuts won't open properly. I have to swipe the current note off in order for the shortcut to open the correct note. As one who goes back and forth between notes this is very inconvenient.
610,Bob Peterson,"November 22, 2019",4," I use this for recipes and well-suited for my use. Locally stored data version much, much too expensive. Entirely unrealistic cost for a retired guy like me so I use the free version. May have to switch to memo app on my phone at some point."
611,Tux Penguin,"November 25, 2019",5," Works great, haven't found anything wrong yet! However, it would be nice if you could put notes in a notebook stack, but not any of notebooks in the stack. Kinda like how you can have a folder with files and subfolders."
612,Siniša Preem,"December 11, 2019",5," Great! Easy to use, has nice features, and makes note keeping easy. I'm missing something like option to interpret markup and HTML. Editor is sometimes too much for keeping programming snippets and the like so a simpler or markdown editing would be nice to have."
613,Peter Reiser,"January 8, 2020",2," It used to be a great app, now it feels like I'm constantly being nagged for having a basic account. I'm just waiting for a better note taker app out there. Sorry Evernote, you've fallen behind."
614,Von Lambright,"January 20, 2020",5," I love this app! I love the way I can organize pretty much anything and search by individual words to find anything I am looking for! I'm sure I could get more out of it if I read up, but I'm getting a lot out of it now!"

618,Animal genie,"March 11, 2020",5, Been using this app Since 2012 approximately. One of the best apps if not the best to keep ur notes saved and synchronized across multiple platforms.
619,C B,"March 12, 2020",1," Always used it for free, switched to a new phone and now I am forced to pay. Used the free trial to get all my important notes, straight away canceled the subscription and deleted the app."

621,Brent Williams II,"November 13, 2019",5," If you can get ideas, thoughts, things you need to remember out of your mind, you have the energy to to so much more. Thank you Evernote. Can you overuse Evernote? No. The more you use it the better you function."
622,Judy Sellens,"December 12, 2019",5, I used Evernote to replace OneNote. Was I ever happy because you can import your OneNote notes into evernote. I had 3300. Evernote works every time. OneNote doesn't. And I expect them to discontinued OneNote very soon.
623,Vishnu Joshi,"December 20, 2019",5," It's great. You can manage some parts of your professional life as well as private life with help of this. Also, so many good features. App design is also great. I personally prefer dark theme."
624,Stefania Soldea,"January 2, 2020",1, I can't stay in the app for 2 seconds until it forces the premium onto me. It is indeed a very good app but I don't want the premium to pop up and to not be able to get out of the offer screen. 2 stars
625,Roberta Coulter,"January 1, 2020",5," Absolute BEST App for keeping track of things I don't want to forget, plus you can link it to your computer & print off your stored information. It's like having my own personal Professional Secretary. Thank you Evernote!!!!!"
626,Elijah Ward,"January 19, 2020",4, I have used evernote for over a year. Its amazing. When you need to write things down it help. I have many notebooks and i keep everything origanized. The only thing I wish EveryNote did was to export whole notebooks to pdf.
627,Kate Kosche,"January 7, 2020",4," Easy to use, complicated to organize. I would like an easier time seeing folders, subfolders, sub-subfolders etc, ideally graphically on one page. Would like ability to delete old stuff more easily too."

630,Michael Toll,"November 13, 2019",5," Such a great app for storing information. This app has allowed me to leave behind all of the paper notes and pieces of information that clutter my life. Nothing is miss placed anymore, it is always just a search away."
631,Taran S. Walia,"November 15, 2019",1, It's just too slow. I like how it automatically saves notes and keeps it updated on the cloud but it takes alot of time to start if you have a lot of notes. I write freuqently so this app becomes a mess
632,Lorinda Newton,"November 18, 2019",4," I use this app to store internet research. Occasionally, when i use the clip feature on my adroid phone, the clip fails. Generally I find this app, which I hsve used for several years, useful as a writer. I do wish it had the notebook look like MS Notebook."
633,Two One,"November 21, 2019",3," User for many yrs. Good but need to improve - while 'saving note as', folders are haphazard, why not UI folder/notebook as usual? — limiting to only 1 subtree is severely limiting - no merge function in mobile like desktop - pwd protection only text, need to have option for whole note/notebook"
634,Fritz,"December 8, 2019",2," Nicely designed, but can't sync, making it pretty useless. Looks like Evernote's resources are stretched too thinly and cannot fix all of their technical issues on the various platforms. Look for alternatives"
635,Jonathan Priest,"December 22, 2019",5," I have come to depend on Evernote and it's ability to sync across my platforms. I don't use all its features and could probably make better use of tags, but it suits my needs."
636,Joe Winner,"January 15, 2020",1, I went to upgrade to premium. At $5.00+ a month. I go to do it and I see a $59.00 + charge. Very very deceptive advertising. Can't recommend upgrading with that schmooze going on...
637,Bruce Conrad,"January 23, 2020",1, Evernote is adding an iphone as device and then asking me to pay for upgrade. I dont own an iphone. This iphone has appeared 6 times ! Now locking me out. I think we are being scammed. I see others with exact same problem.
638,Robert Merlin Davis,"January 31, 2020",5, Been using Evernote almost every single day for years - including the full multimedia capabilities for creating commercials while travelling internationally.
639,Marek Prochaska,"February 13, 2020",5," Great app to write and backup notes, only thing missing for me is ability to password protect notes."
640,Vats dimri,"February 7, 2020",4, Great app. It would have been 5 Stars if it gave at least 200MB monthly upload limits.
641,Ted McKey,"February 10, 2020",4," Use it all the time, and not anywhere near to its full potential. Runs great on my MS Surface Pro 3 and recent model Samsung phone."
642,yosafat novianto ade putra,"February 16, 2020",1, You can't access note history unless you're premium user.. As a free user I can't recover text that I accidentally deleted.. thanks Evernote..
643,Bobby Griffith,"February 23, 2020",3, The app crashes just about every time I rotate my phone. I keep losing my data.
644,Richard Bardsley,"February 24, 2020",2," Just no cohesive experience across platforms, completely different UI across web, ios, android and no doubt PC, which I don't use."
645,Sean Kamp,"March 7, 2020",5," A true legend among every app I've ever used. I would die for Claire from the Bon Appetit Test Kitchen, and in my final breath, she would know to use Evernote."
646,Ronnie Lam,"March 3, 2020",5," I like it available on multiple devices, not only android but also ios devices, and sharing notes with friends."
647,Bruce Li,"March 13, 2020",5, Very good App but...Why the camera function be the same as IOS version? with an edit button after transfer to Document.
648,Welovethe Jayhawks,"March 17, 2020",5, Love it...I use it for everything. It has helped me organize my thoughts and made my life incredibly easier.
649,relikvija,"April 1, 2020",5," You cant go wrong with this app. All ypur stuff in one place across all platforms... Sign me up! Wait, I'm already signed up."

651,Carla Fink,"December 10, 2019",5," Love Evernote. 💕💕 I use it as my accesible archive for immediate & important things - theater tickets, recipes, medical reports, urgent reminders. I'm continually amazed that IT ACTUALLY WORKS. Also, I'm a fan of elephants. Love the logo."
652,M. Conrades,"January 19, 2020",5," I love, love, love that I can create notes on my cell phone and then access them on my desktop computer. Especially useful for taking notes on doctor visits and then have them for the family medical files."
653,Sri Hidayat Sukanta,"February 2, 2020",1," I installed this app before on my cellphone, now i want to install on my tablet because the first is damage. But you force me to upgrade to premium ?

But you force me to upgrade to premium ? Sorry... i choose to not using this app anymore. It okay and its your right if you want to growth your revenue. But don't give option to user to continue with free version is not wise. Always backup your data to external media to prevent device lost or damaged"
654,Nabbyhubplus Vlog,"February 9, 2020",4," Great app... Been using it for years, and it's proved to be second to no other."
655,Tasha Julie,"February 7, 2020",4," Hello Team, Could it be possible for one to be able to hide notes? It will truly make work easier in regards to the notes that you don't want to be displayed on the home page."
656,Braydon Johansen,"February 22, 2020",3," Good app over all, but there is no way that i can find to contact them about the occasional problem that arises. Customer support sucks, and the help in learning section is it's not helpful."
657,Scott M Rasmussen,"November 30, 2019",5, I have been in every new user for 10 years and have a great deal of valuable information that is easily accessed. I love the search feature will search for Words even in a picture!! Evernote is the best!!
658,Gregory Todd,"January 3, 2020",5," For my purposes, this app is incredibly useful - I use it all the time, across all my devices: Android phone, iPads, and Windows 7 and 10 computers. I love it."
659,Dontrel 3030,"January 7, 2020",3, This app has consistently gotten slower and slower over time and isn't very convenient. Opening a new note takes too long. Starting up takes too long.
660,William,"January 7, 2020",5," Evernote is a great little app. The interface is easy navigation. Now Evernote, just make a better version then this one! That's the only thing you can do, really. Thank you for your product, Evernote. 👍🌏👍🌎👍🌍👍🌏👍 WTG guys..."
661,alisa Alisa,"January 6, 2020",1," Waste app. There asking money for everything. That too monthly payment. Better download MS Word for Android. That is absolutely free in Android platform, you will get so so much of features also. Don't waste your data by downloading this greedy app"

667,moses mutua,"April 1, 2020",5, Great note organizer of all time
668,Vitor Cunha,"January 9, 2020",4, Needs Linux desktop support. Yes I know theirs the browser option. Don't want to use it. If windows/mac users have a desktop option Linux should too. Having notes offline on the desktop is important.
669,Brian,"November 20, 2019",5," Does exactly what it should do, makes keeping and categorizing notes simple and quick. For me, speed of access and entry are very important as well as the ability to sort into notebooks."
670,Christine Huitema,"November 21, 2019",5, I love to take notes of everything I want to remember. This app helps me to keep it all organized! Plus it can sync to all my devices which is a feature I love. I have used it for years and will continue to use it.

678,Moses Peraza,"February 1, 2020",1," I liked this app I built up a lot of information on it. Now it is forcing me to do a free trial that I don't want to do. Therefore I am going to uninstall it, and forget it."
679,Cathal Coughlan,"January 29, 2020",1," Terrible. I have a tiny scanner app which is easier to use, and didn't cost 60 euro"
680,Lzrd ndr,"February 9, 2020",1, List note with time and line so confusing me! Make it simple with only add 1 line and dont separate them!
681,Dave Howard,"February 16, 2020",4, Very useful. Syncs well between all devices. Needs a button to insert date in notes.
682,Jennifer Muir,"March 1, 2020",5, LOVE THIS APP! I keep all of my notes in it and can get to it from any device. I JUST found out about the EVERNOTE WEB CLIPPER that I'm installing as well.
683,MRUNALI PEDNEKAR,"April 4, 2020",5," Always there to listen to me...and to save my thoughts, memories and some photos too..."
684,Javier Correa,"January 2, 2020",1," Full of bugs, for some reason the letter size is different randomly and no way to fix it. The letter size problem doesn't happen on the PC."
685,Simon Susina,"November 18, 2019",5," Excellent app, works reliably, have been using it for the past few years and it hasn't let me down. I'm using Evernote Sticky Notes to synchronize Evernote notes to my PC running Windows."

687,Linda Schumann,"November 28, 2019",5, I only recently started using Evernote to its full potential. I can save screenshots of recipes or lists of things. My husband and I can have shared files.
688,Va Le Ah,"November 24, 2019",1," I've been using Evernote for several years. ISSUE: I got a replacement phone this week. All of my notes uploaded, but now the editing toolbar is missing. How can this be fixed?"
689,Geva Music,"December 15, 2019",1," Loved it for years and wished they would support right to left languages, now they even removed the option to align text left-to right on pc or any device. Sorry Evernote, but I quit."

691,Bettie Nebergall,"December 22, 2019",5," Great for recipes! I scanned my old cookbooks, copy new ideas from websites to my computer, and have them all at my fingertips on my tablet in the kitchen. Easy to use and easy to share."
692,Cynthia Van Dam,"December 29, 2019",5," I like the ability to easily take notes. I can record uplifting thoughts I hear at church, questions for my doctor, a shopping list, mantras for meditation, dishes I do or dont like at restaurants......"
693,Alex Chen,"January 2, 2020",1, Please add a way to instantly scroll to the bottom of a note when you edit it. Most people add notes to the end of a note. When you have already written alot it's a pain to scroll to the bottom every time. People have been asking for this for years!
694,Renaissance Man,"January 14, 2020",4," A very powerful app, but the upgrade is priced rather stiffly at almost 75.00 (in a single payment) recurring annually or almost 100.00 (paid monthly) thus the lack of a 5 star rating."
695,Limo Choi,"January 23, 2020",3, It is good for note and save my information but now push me upgrade and pay every month I do not want! I try to move all my information to else but Not a let me into account It is awful service I want my all information back!
696,Mike Merkle,"February 4, 2020",1," Reset my password five times and logged in through desktop, but couldn't get app to authenticate. Uninstalled."
697,SoloBi N,"February 7, 2020",5, A great app to store info and documents. Saved a lot of materials for me. Glad to have it.
698,Tabbatha Kristie Barba,"February 7, 2020",4, mostly great but sometimes not as fluent as I want it to be I'm sure what time you guys will get things more streamlined. And also I'm sure if I were to purchase things would be a lot better lol
699,Rizomer,"March 4, 2020",4," Aside being concerned with data privacy and security, great !"
700,John Louw,"February 24, 2020",5," This app is user friendly, It does what is promises Easy to use Has kept up with technological development Updates are regular and effective Thank you Will upgrade to pro shortly"
701,Emerald Saldanha,"November 19, 2019",5, So easy to use! Super helpful in keeping quick notes from a quick food order to summary of information I need for work. Love using the camera function to keep track of items I like or business cards that I usually lose.
702,Rahul Vansh,"November 15, 2019",4, Handwriting features should have Grid options too! ie. It should be visible while taking notes and will disappear after taking it. It'll make more convenient to take hand notes.
703,Orrin Stimpson,"November 20, 2019",5, I've really enjoyed using this app. I don't upload enough stuff so I'm able to just use the free version. I also like that my notes go with me when I get a new phone just by downloading the app on the new phone.
704,Ai Deng,"November 24, 2019",3," The ink notes have a significant delay. Onenote is much better! Also please add gridline to ink notes. Also hoping the related notes can be shown more prominently, say at the end of notes."
705,Artem X,"November 27, 2019",1," Used to be a pioneer in cross-platform notes but then got worse and worse. Not available offline, limited number of devices. Now can't even open it in mobile browser! I will take all my notes to one note now."
706,Tony Sidaway,"December 4, 2019",5," I use this for project development notes and as a general diary. It does a simple task very well. There is even an IFTTT app to synchronise new notes with Google's calendar, so I can see my notes alongside other events."
707,ajay gawli,"December 14, 2019",5, Awesome experience I am using it for 1 month and it plays an important role for my SSC examination. No need to make hand written notes save questions and answers on it and audio as well and open it anywhere anytime Thanks Evernote team
708,Jotham Dudley,"January 8, 2020",2," Everything is great apart from when adding notes to the home screen, they don't take you to the note, rather they just open the app. Will change to 5 starts once this is fixed"
709,Amanda Barrios,"January 19, 2020",3, The app itself is really useful in that it's a sort of all-inclusive organizer. Could have had more stars if it wouldnt send me multiple notifications throughout the day suggesting I go premium.
710,Royce Kearnan,"January 13, 2020",5," Fantastic app which I've recommended to many family and friends. Particularly like the document scan feature, very helpful for keeping track of receipts for important purchases."

713,Roberta Mandernack,"November 17, 2019",4," I've had a good experience with Evernote, except everytime I open it, it pushes me to upgrade, which I did a while back. No matter what I do, it tells me to upgrade every single time I open it."

717,Shruti Kulkarni,"December 9, 2019",4," Super experience to have quick note for anything, it set many thing automatically. For notebook should have some improvements such as sorting for subjects or adding dates and time for notes."
718,HopeAnchors TheSoul,"December 9, 2019",5," Best app ever. Even better with the paid subscription version. I never los anything saved throigh evernote no matter howany phones i go through and as long as i have my email, i have access to it on any device 24/7"
719,Ranae Bryan,"December 23, 2019",5, I love Evernote! I keep notes about almost everything I want to document or remember. It's great that it syncs across my devices. It's easy to search for things or to look up notes by tags.
720,Christiaan van Schalkwyk,"January 21, 2020",4, I like to use Evernote to keep relevant details together. I only went for the paid version recently so I'm not sure of all features but like what I've used.
721,Anton Malafeev,"January 28, 2020",4, Using it since ages. Very helpful. Even if mobile experience is not that comfortable though
722,Ashley Derar Ghadi Chaccour,"January 29, 2020",3, Need more text editing options such as choosing different colors when writing or highlighting .
723,facundo farall,"February 13, 2020",4, Functionalities are great but the looks not so good. Not a big fan of the all green look.
724,Brittany Ball,"February 18, 2020",5, I love this app. It is really great for organizing research and my novel alike!
725,Carlos Eduardo C. da Silva,"February 25, 2020",2, The reminders does not have push notifications. Only an email. Frustrating!
726,Michael Jurgensen,"March 8, 2020",1, Used to be great...but now you have to play a monthly fee to use it. Delete.
727,Saihou Trera,"November 11, 2019",4, Very good and safe application for your notes and anything that you want to save and access it in the future. I could give 5 stars it could support right to left writing like Arabic.
728,Michael Evans,"November 15, 2019",5," Excellent app. I finally have access to all of my needed information and notes that I can access from my desktop, iPhone, ipad pro, macbook pro, and my android tablet."

I have successfully used Evernote on phone and computer. I haven't had any major headaches in the years I've used it. Some minor things have to do with learning the application, and there's one thing I want to do now and then and I always forget that I can't do it until I've looked for the option for a while."
730,Anastasia Macdonald,"November 27, 2019",5," I heavily use Evernote to capture my ideas, make notes, clip articles and much, more. As someone who tends to live in my head more often than not, Evernote provides excellent features for outlet. Bravo Evernote! 👍🏽"

732,1Stop Online,"November 25, 2019",5," Awsome - would like the ability to turn option green once tick box has been ticked, this would make it much easier to see when something is done, this used to work in a previous version."

734,Angelo Castiglione,"November 25, 2019",4," It's a great app and I use it everyday to organise my notes. I just wish that there was a way of having multiple tabs open through the app, to access the main notes I use most frequently."
735,Tyler Conder,"December 4, 2019",1, I signed up for the subscription on a different device and have since changed to new device. App won't recognize subscription on new device despite the fact I'm logged in with same account.
736,Gowtham jeyabalan,"December 10, 2019",4, Good. But there should be an option to choose what page the Evernote opens with. It always opens with All notes. It would be better if we can choose what notebook to open the app with.
737,Gili Litwack,"January 1, 2020",2, Damn notification shows up every day saying Evernote spotlight stopped unexpectedly. Multiple times. This has been going on for months if not years and there's been no fix.
738,antonio ferranti,"December 12, 2019",5, Absolutely love it. Had this for about 3 years now and I can't believe I'm finally writing a review. I use it for everything work related and creative. Seriously. A+
739,Debra Drennan,"December 18, 2019",2, It was working fine until a week ago. Now the keyboard freezes as well as functions on the screen and has become impossible to make new notes.

742,Onyeagu Emeke,"January 14, 2020",5," Powerful app, it's the best note app I have ever used. I advice everyone who likes to take notes regularly to use this app, it's universal feature across platforms is also impeccable. Thanks for giving us such a gift."
743,Pierre Habimana,"January 22, 2020",5," Good app. Helps me notetake even when i'm on the free package. I can't imagine what else i would need or want from a paid package, other than using the app on more than two devices."
744,shravan shettar,"January 29, 2020",4, Great app with free note storage and more it's kind of all in one storage very satisfied.
745,Muhammad Hasan,"March 3, 2020",5, So far the best app for notes. Although there should a public network of shared notes whre people can read notes of others.
746,rose cox,"March 3, 2020",5, I use it a lot for saving info I will or might need in the future. I might only be an unsophisticated user but I would really miss it if I didn't have it. I love it!

752,Peggy Thompson,"November 30, 2019",5," I have used the app for years. It's so easy to clip web pages, save email, and run searches. Premium is a great value."
753,Madonna P,"November 30, 2019",3," Love Evernote, especially the fact that I can password protect it and can share links to my notes with others. But why can't I copy and paste and access my clipboard? Hoping the update fixes these issues."
754,Mike Hendrickson,"November 24, 2019",1, I just want to take a picture and make notes on the picture. Why is that so impossible for people to create. Absolutely ridiculous. Picture then notes. Simple concept. Why can't any POS app Dev. make it. Either it's over complicated to do or there is only filters or tags for their dumb Facebook's.
755,Bonnie Warstler,"December 3, 2019",1," Right now I have to give this app low rating because it won't allow me in without signing up to pay, even though I only have the app on one device. I received reply back and they send links that aren't helpful. I'm very frustrated!"

758,Eylin N,"December 30, 2019",1," The search feature doesn't work so I end up having to manually look for my note. It wqs great before but if I can't find what I'm looking for, the app is not serving my purpose."
759,Linda S Hansen,"January 27, 2020",5," Absolutely love this App. When my phone crashed, I opened up my new phone and not a Note was Lost. All my Brain Farts goes on there. Thank you for this Gem 🌞 Sincerely Linda S. Hansen, DC"
760,Shubh Saxena,"February 4, 2020",4, Really great app but has been crashing on redmi note 8 pro. And there hasn't been any updates for it
761,Alex Carlile,"February 27, 2020",3, The fact that you can't make stacks of notes within stacks is basically the reason why I am switching to Notion.
762,Alfredo Nevarez,"March 13, 2020",3, Everything is great except the s pen experience. The pen is slow and feels unnatural.
763,Cheryl Tate,"March 13, 2020",5, This is a good app for keeping ideas and projects organized. I can always go back and reference
764,Emir Saleh,"March 14, 2020",5, Great Apps....and very user friendly
765,Justin Fidel,"November 22, 2019",2," Good features but unreliable. Don't save anything important in this app. Consistently crashes and/or becomes unresponsive, losing notes in-progress entirely."
766,SVS Malik,"December 13, 2019",5," With Evernote premium I could enjoy Hassel-free downloads, clippings and auto-saving of any kind of data. Moreover, it can be shared on two devices in a realtime mode. It's just wonderful."
767,Antti Ranta,"November 8, 2019",2," I like the light/dark theme, however I wish it would follow the system's night mode setting. Sometimes Evernote adds non-visible space characters to notes' text and when I paste the text to a terminal it will fail."
768,Charles Ball,"November 12, 2019",4, Great app for keeping lists and notes organized by notebooks i.e. folders. Easy to sync with desktop application. Would give 5 stars if start screen on android app showed only notebooks instead of recent notes.
769,Scarlett Lee,"November 10, 2019",4, Good and convenient that it can be shared on several devices. However some buttons are not user friendly and efficient enough. I will recommend to the others.
770,Moriel Fishman,"November 20, 2019",4," I have been using Evernote for almost two years now. I love it, it's a great tool... Except the fact that it doesn't support RTL languages. I would really love to be able to use it both for Hebrew and Arabic."
771,R Bolar,"November 26, 2019",5, This cloud based note app is very convenient to use. Upload you document once and access it from any device anywhere. A great productivity tool.
772,Paul Shaver,"December 5, 2019",5, Great app to use as a pastor! I use it to track information and save receipts for accounting purposes. I also use it for liturgical items such as baptismal vows and anointing rituals. Very handy and useful app!
773,John-Paul Re,"December 15, 2019",4, The free version does everything I need. If you need big / many pictures you can update to the paid version. As a home user it's not needed. Cheers.
774,Akash Waghmare,"December 22, 2019",3, The app gets slow many times. There is scope of improving the user interface. Also need more tools to format the content.
775,Randolph Sydnor,"December 19, 2019",1, Evernote offers NO direct tech support for those who pay $70 yearly and I have paid for awhile. Terrible! There are other issues too but too lengthy for 500 words.
776,Brian Engwall,"December 31, 2019",5, Love the free version that I've been using for about 2 years. Only problem is that I went through a couple of phones this past month and can't get to all my important notes

778,Kristy Monroe,"January 4, 2020",5, I love the syncing from one device to another and the ability to organize my notes in folders. Being able to attend a meeting with just my phone in hand is very usefil!
779,Darkion Avey,"January 16, 2020",1, Google keep is better alternative. All premium features are absurdly trivial like offline availability and search within attached documents. If it weren't for my supervisor I wouldn't have used this app
780,Donnie B,"February 29, 2020",2, Says free limit of 60mb/month. Doesn't allow to save notes of 8 mb in second month. Wow!
781,Warren Barrett,"March 1, 2020",5," Best Note App available, available on all platforms, with syncing, offline and web integration, without needing the app."
782,Varun Koul,"April 9, 2020",1, Bugs again 😖 in the desktop version
783,Naveen Raj,"February 15, 2020",2, Well use for students but its basic account is set trouble with storage limit kindly make some benefits for basic account users for offline access
784,Theresa Schwab,"November 15, 2019",5, I use Evernote for all my notes. The sync between my computer and phone is a feature I rely on regularly. It is in integral part of my work and personal effectiveness.

786,Aaron Fuentes,"December 28, 2019",5," Good stuff, lots of organizational features. My girlfriend uses 'One Note', looks pretty awesome. You'll have to compare."
787,Salvadore Mustafaja,"January 6, 2020",4, Amazing app but shame on you guys for not allowing dark mode on the pc app not everyone can afford a mac or iphone and you should consider that but aside from that very efficent app you guys do need to geta timeline tho on that esspecially if customers are paying.
788,Rabbi Morata,"December 26, 2019",5," A very convenient app, given one can open one's document in any device, anytime, anywhere. Also without worrying of losing data through time."

793,Pratikshy Tiwari,"April 14, 2020",5, Very good app for notetaking. Very useful especially for students.
794,Grin,"April 16, 2020",1, UI is unintuitive.
795,r f,"November 23, 2019",1, Never used it. There doesn't seem to be in need to have an account to use a note-taking program. Being forced to be tracked is kind of ridiculous. Uninstalling immediately.
796,Josh Green,"December 2, 2019",4," Have been using for quite some time, found it handy for web clipping, storing PDF's, saving YouTube videos & writing notes for work. It seems like there's endless amount of storage as well!"
797,Mostafa Gaafar Mansour,"December 7, 2019",3, Keeps crashing on my computer.. also automatic camera function takes low quality photos. Finally poor pdf integration in the android app. Would be nice to see support for a stylus. Otherwise good overall note taking app
798,Caleb Evins,"December 6, 2019",5, Having my notes across multiple devices has been a real godsend in college. Notes I typed in class on my computer can be easily viewed on my phone when I need to study last minute before a test or something. Awesome app!
799,Mariah R,"December 12, 2019",2, This used to be good at saving articles but now it only saves part of the article and cuts them off vertically so you can't see a whole sentence.
800,Tom Hammell,"January 5, 2020",3," Nice program, but new version is feeling the squeeze, filling your phone with maximum intrusive screen interruptions every time you pick it up. If this keeps up, time to change."
801,Kevin,"December 21, 2019",5," My favourite note taking app. Fast, easy to use, feature rich but simple presentation. Would recommend to anyone."

804,Amna Ali,"January 28, 2020",5, One of my favourite apps for detailed notes or just a quick note to myself. I love Evernote!
805,Paul Moore,"February 17, 2020",3," Lost of amazing features, but I'm sticking with One Note for its better stylus support and more advanced palm rejection features."
806,Colin Dando,"February 25, 2020",1, Web clipping is rubbish. Impossible to change password. Can't log on via web on an android device. Flawed. Will stop using
807,Mark McMahon,"March 20, 2020",4, Very useful for personal details and measurements. Also internet clipping is very efficient
808,Michael Finley,"November 26, 2019",4," Great, but reminders show blank notes, when you click on them from the notification bar. You have to close the open note and then search for the reminder in your notes! Help!"
809,John Foster,"December 4, 2019",5," I have used Evernote for over 3 years and have collected priceless insights, memories, and other groupings of thoughts that is just not possible in an analog manner. I love Evernote!"
810,ankita patel,"January 3, 2020",5, Really great app. Most important thing is you can share todo list hustle free with team mate or family members. With different notebooks you can maintain subjects/area.
811,Gavin Sidebottom,"January 2, 2020",5," Easy UI, fast multi-device sync, nice organization. Evernote has been my note taking app for a few years now and the yearly subscription is well worth it"
812,Nick Lough,"December 18, 2019",2, No ability to add color to text on the app. This is greatly disappointing and will probably be the one thing that causes me to go back to google docs.
813,laura Smith,"December 31, 2019",5," Best note saver! I use this to make lists as well as keep recipes of family's favorite so when I'm not home, I have everything I need."
814,Manoj Selvan,"January 30, 2020",1, Too many bugs and problems while opening in pc and again in mobiles.

816,Karthiyayani Marar,"November 15, 2019",5," I was using Evernote right now, I tired to share the internal link with one of my friend. After that when I opened my app, the document I was working on was gone. Any solutions?"
817,mostafa Ibn Minem,"November 16, 2019",5," I've been using this app for over six years now. I hardly find myself comfortable with using any other text-editing applications. Keep the good work up guys, and thank you for the great app."

826,Reuben Rodrigues,"April 18, 2020",4, Great app but less cloud space
827,Joseph Tama,"February 29, 2020",1," Stop asking to confirm my email! What a sad evolution to what once was a great product. Unfortunately Microsofts mobile apps are still not there, otherwise evernote would have been gone years ago."

833,Junaid Khan,"January 7, 2020",3," If I open EN to see my agenda in Dubai - & next time I open EN to see my agenda in Vancouver - it uses the last seen, ie Dubai, as the default. I have to go back, close all screens & input Vancouver again. Irritating. Thinking of switching to free or cheaper alternative. Junaid Khan"

839,Vsevolod Kvachev,"November 24, 2019",1," Fake dark mode This app doesn't have dark mode that respects amoled capabilities. Backgrounds are light grey here. This is unacceptible for notes/text app, background should be 100% black and text should be 100% white"

Now it has locked me out of my account because I surpassed the limit of times to unsync a device. Major design flaw in the app, and I won't be using it anymore."

I just can't fathom how this app would be worth that much to anyone when there is nothing here that the free options don't give you. The document scanning in Evernote is amazing and far superior to any competitor but that hardly justifies the subscription based model or the high fee for this subscription. Overall, at a one time fee of $20, this would be excellent value. For now, I'm back to Keep."

1698,Ave Maria,"January 22, 2020",1, It had a bug and all my notes were stuck and unavailable. You have to pay for tech support. It's far reaching permissions that it wants me to pay for is ridiculous. Notes can only be shared with other Evernote users. Uninstalled.

I do not find it especially easy to use. The organization of notes, notebooks, and notebooks stacks is very confusing. Even after using it for several years I still don't get it. I end up using the search function to find what I'm looking for because the organization doesn't make sense. I found Microsoft OneNote to be much more intuitive but less Android-friendly which is why I opted for Evernote. Evernote does sync well between Android and PCs. The addition of encryption for sensitive or very personal notes has been a good addition. Thank you."
1701,HOA MAI,"November 18, 2019",2, Very annoyed to push upgrade

It's really useful for taking notes during university lectures and seminars and the like, and the notebook and stack features are so handy. However, I've recently switched to using the handwriting feature, and have had nothing but issues with it. After every lecture, I've found that the handwriting pages have duplicated for apparently no reason, but today I found that it deleated half of my notes as soon as I left the editing page. The navigation between the editing pages is also unwieldy and could do with more more refinement. Overall, I'm really disappointed that this feature doesn't match up with how great the rest of the app is. I really hope this can be amended in the next update"

It's insane and I think that's the reason Evernote is not doing well financially. Instead of charging people $8 with 10GB file limit, let them add 3GB per month and charge them $2 per month. And add another paid plan that let people connect unlimited devices for $1 per month. I know you are looking for a way to charge people as much as possible ($8!!), but that just doesn't work out in the long term. And also let your free users add at least 200MB per month...

All I've done in past few weeks is type up a few text shopping lists and now I can't use the app for 8 days, until the new month starts. Tried to make a new note and can't paste like I used to. App is a brick now. Hope they fix it. Note8"

You can read all the reviews and features for details and of course there are some high limits in the paid version you will never reach mostly for eg., 10 GB upload a month, 250 mb per note, 100,000 tags etc etc. The cross platform sync is great and the windows client is awesome!! All other notes apps pale in comparison including one called OneNote It's sad that Evernote has been in the news for wrong reasons and the company is struggling with high profile departures etc. But what it has done for Note taking is legendary. Hoping it thrives and prospers for many years There are of course some minor negatives such as no recurring reminders, poor native integration with Google calendar etc but the strengths are so awesome that it's difficult to think of migrating to any other notes app."

My biggest beef right now with EN is that their mobile apps are limited and not as robust as web or Mac/PC version. For example EN's lack of ability to create and edit tables on mobile versions. These should be the same between platforms."

[If Evernote can come up with some affordable hardware support like writing pad - it would revolutionized the whole market (especially in developing countries like India.) and world] beside making the software a buzz word. 2) calendar support (if possible-) 3) provide a feature to pin some important note at top in the notebook. 4) Spread sheet features. If like my suggestion then give me royalty 😂😂 Well it's an awesome app I must say. I gave it one start just to attract attention of developers... So that more can be added to it to serve the need of more n more.

That being said, this app has much better support for Andoird however the support for Chromebook is so-so. The app relies on your device's keyboard autocorrect features, which is great....for phones. My chromebook has a physical keyboard and thus doesn't have autocorrect built in. It is annoying to be reading through my notes and having to also spell check everything at the same time. The drawing feature is basic, but okay. After clicking the drawing icon it opens up a new page for your drawings, and once finished will simply ""paste"" the entire large picture under your notes. It would be nice if I could just annotate my notes and draw small diagrams next to, or between, paragraphs of text notes. I assume this is related to the lack of Chromebook support as that would be difficult to accomplish on a phone. You have the ability to add in photos from your gallery or dowloads into notes, which is awesome in addition to my Chromebooks ""snippet"" feature, however you can NOT resize the image from within the app. You must open the image seperately, edit the sizing of the photo (guessing on how it will fit in your notes) and then REIMPORT the image to the notes. This is annoying and frustrating. All in all, this app is not bad and gets the job I need done better than Microsoft (on android) but lacks support for Chromebook. Improve Chromebook support and I will happily raise my rating of this app."

I broke my laptop hence bought a new one. So i installed your App, login -- and NO NOTES WERE THERE. Did I sync? ofcourse i did. I know how technology works. So ofc i sync, again and again and again. Nothing. All i get is ""My first Notebook""..   I am highly dissapointed. Pretty damn sure none of you are gonna retrieve back all my notebooks coz i didnt pay anything. I am even scared to sync my phone anymore. Coz if i sync, pretty dman sure it's gonna follow what is on the website. - A BLANK Notebook..  thanks Evernote.

2419,Derek Busby,"June 23, 2019",1, Evernote is a good app but lately it has begun holding entries hostage requiring a (pay) upgrade to access them. This seems to be an unfair (illegal?) marketing practice. I have uninstalled this app and will be using other (free) note apps going forward. Good riddance Evernote.
2420,Shivaang Sharma,"June 26, 2019",5, Migrated to Evernote from three years of OneNote. Can't believe i ignored this incredibly flexible and user friendly service for so long. I hope the team continues to make the PC interface more aesthetically pleasing (still feels outdated) and adds better one drive integration.
2421,Derek Thomson,"July 30, 2019",4," Very good app. Being able to make different notebooks on various subjects is a big bonus. This makes it more organised than the likes of Google Docs. Previously there were some save or syncing bugs, but this seems to have been resolved."
2422,Kiaransalee Rilyn Arokh,"July 23, 2019",1," I expected it to be simple to use... It's easy enough to write a note but how do I find that file later?!! There's no obvious way to find and open saved notes. If I have to Google for it, I'd rather switch to a more intuitive app. Just saying."
2423,Benjamin College,"July 20, 2019",5, This app is my life. I use it to gather my thoughts throughout the day and organize projects. I highly recommend the premium version to access more memory and the option to sync devices. This ensures all my notes made on my phone make it to my computer where I work on said projects.

2426,Paul S,"August 28, 2019",5, Itʼs been almost instantaneous when you take down notes especially on desktop. The app offers formatting if youʼre into organizing your notes. Get the premium to get wider access of devices if youʼre like me who needs to make a note of every detail anytime anywhere.
2427,ExHaile Thurtyfieve,"September 19, 2019",5," Dope af. A lil spendy for subscription but free version works great for personal use.

Should I install Dropbox, too?"
2496,A Google user,"January 14, 2019",3, The app is decent. I would like it to be more visually appealing though: like the widget to be color coordinated or the folders to be allowed to be a different color scheme to help make it more organized.

2500,Glen Baker,"March 29, 2019",3, All the basics + very nice widgets. Switched from OneNote because this is more responsive and stable. Will not be sticking with this app because it does not have the ability to lock specific notes and always starts up in 'all notes'.

2547,Ahiesh PVS,"October 18, 2019",5," Great note taking app. However, there still more room to grow. Below are some to name a few: 1. Bring in uniformity in features across OS and devices 2.

2561,Mone H,"February 3, 2019",3, I would really like to use it as my main note app. But the limited number of 2 device sync is very limiting. US$9.99 per month is way too much for me as a not-so-heavy user. It'll be great if there is a <=2.99/m personal plan that relaxes the sync limit to 5+.

2588,Tim H,"March 16, 2019",1, I want to take notes and have them saved to the cloud. That's it. Evernote has become bloated with pointless features and complexity. They've forgotten why they exist. Look elsewhere and use something simple.
2589,Chi Ceasar,"April 25, 2019",5, Really good for note taking and editing text. Photos tend to be a problem as they occasionally mess up the formating and especially videos give me trouble as the source isn't properly anchored via shortcut. However as I mostly use it for texts it's perfect for my needs.
2590,Mette Christine Olsen,"October 31, 2018",5, This app is great! With the new widgets it's even better than before. It helps me organize ideas and lists much better than any other notes app I've tried before. It also syncs instantly between my phone and pc which is nice.
2591,Nimit Khandelwal,"April 17, 2019",4, Note taking is good. I haven't tried much of its features yet but i jave indeed tried the photo notes feature.

I haven't tried much of its features yet but i jave indeed tried the photo notes feature. Evernote tried to implement kind of the thing that CamScanner does. You know increasing the document's brightness and stuff but it often cuts out the edges of the docu. that is very irritating. 4stars for that reason only.
2592,A Google user,"October 16, 2018",1," Too many bugs, when typing notes, the app inserts repeated letters all by itself. For example, when typing ""bad app"" it types ""bbbbaaaadddd apppp"". Also if anything is misspelled or abbreviated the word magically disappears on its own."
2593,Paul Robinson,"July 19, 2019",4," EDIT: As of 19th July much improved, it's back to old speeds, huzzah! Incredibly slow as of last updates. My phone is less than a year old and all other apps work fine so it's not that, it just suddenly got 5x slower. The same thing happened on my iPad a while back."
2594,Sher,"June 21, 2019",2," Loved EN from day 1, but Last Update really messed up the Mobile App for Galaxy S8 plus, it keeps showing Notes and if they are clicked on there's nothing, it's blank! Can't go back. You have to clear it off phone and have restart it to see anything. Over and over. Plz fix this!"
2595,Nabil Shalaby,"June 24, 2019",2, Text note typing lags for no reason ..probably App is synchinc at every character you type....it's a deficiency ...also for Saving any note the Ok button /or back button is located inconveniently to the top left ..furthest point to your finger which is unpractical for frequent use.
2596,Nafees Shihab,"March 18, 2020",5, Awesome app. I love it.
2597,Isaac Sitenga,"July 24, 2019",4," Sometimes has syncing issues if the desktop version is open at the same time, but otherwise works exactly how I want it to. They make the premium version better without making the free version unusable, which is refreshing."
2598,Frans R. Lambrechtsen,"August 4, 2019",5, I've been using Evernote since 2011. I use it for keeping and accessing notes....on the go. I've been aware of and looked at alternatives. I've kept coming back to Evernote. Easy. Intuitive. I see myself using Evernote well into the future.
2599,Alec Galambos,"August 13, 2019",4," This app runs my life. I wish the search were more reliable though--when you offload your memory to the cloud, it can be unsettling when you don't find something you are sure you wrote down a year ago (until you search using the web app, that is.)"
2600,nayelli perez,"August 23, 2019",5, I like it so far. I can record the lecture while I type and highlight and format it. It is a lot neater than writting. I can even add some notes and pages onto my notes and annotate it on the website then upload it onto my notes.
2601,F. Adrian O,"August 15, 2019",1," The mobile app freezes constantly. Simply trying to update a note makes the app unresposive and it has to be killed, because Waiting doesn't work. I try multiple times and keep seeing the same problem. I gave up and will update on the computer version of Evernote. Really frustrating."
2602,Anshy A-Cardoza,"August 14, 2019",5," I Love Evernote!! I have the paid suscription now, just because I have Evernote in ALL of my devices. I love it that they do provide a pretty complete non-paying option. I wish there were more text formating options on the mobile version though."
2603,Tracy Kaylie,"August 31, 2019",4," Evernote is great. The only major problem is that they only allow you to share / send notes via link to evernote, instead of sharing as a pdf on an email. That's how most people would prefer to receive them. Add that feature and it's 5 stars."
2604,William Howell,"September 7, 2019",5," I use evernote as my todo list, my software algorithm notes, my med schedule, my future planning things, and anything else that i want to save and have on the go. I pay for the pro version. Also since it isn't apparent, you can group notes."
2605,Shanie Tee,"September 11, 2019",4, Able to connect to not only phone device but laptop as well making it an user friendly application. The functions are minimalistic which I like and the notes are saved automatically. It'd be nice if it can be synced to Microsoft word. Thank you!
2606,Shy BP,"October 11, 2019",4, I use the app a lot. The features I love: tags/ scan or photo books or pages that I can keep and have access to when needed/reminder alerts on notes ... Features I want: it to be in a drive format rather than in notebooks/ Collaboration/ saving of documents and spreadsheets
2607,Dean,"October 8, 2019",3," I have extensively tested several note taking apps. Microsoft OneNote is hands-down the best. It is more versatile, powerful, collaborative, and cross-platform than Evernote. Plus, it is totally free upcharge for the full version. I recommend giving Microsoft OneNote a try."
2608,Dan Tadesse,"November 6, 2019",3," Too slow. Syncing is painfully slow. Also needs a design refresh, pretty outdated."
2609,Amarnath Chakraborty,"November 4, 2019",4," Very useful for making draft copy, important notes, hand written notes etc."
2610,Junnie Chen,"November 16, 2019",5, Love this app ! I use it as a diary for years now...not sure if it has a feature to print out in a booklet yet.
2611,Brijesh Patel,"December 29, 2019",5, Very very good and very usefull
2612,Mukhtar D,"January 6, 2020",5, This app holds me down so nicely! I've been an avid and frequent user for the past 5yrs without fail! I love it
2613,MD SOHAG,"January 8, 2020",5, Very good app. Bt not easy to use
2614,Miguel Medina,"March 17, 2019",1," ""Note conflict"" error makes it unusable as I want to use the app on the tube or train. Google Keep doesn't have this issue so it's much more convenient for preparing my notes and tasks on the commute."
2615,sheeren xaidi,"September 25, 2018",1," I loved it earlier now it is getting on my nerves, every time i open something it interrupts and open adds to get premium plan, if i don't want a premimium plan why the hell it pops up every time, it is pathetic now, disrupts whatever i am doing, hating this app"
2616,F Hang,"March 24, 2019",3," I can't clip content from twitter...Is there anyone has the same problem? It says ""You are on Twitter Mobile because you are using an old version of Firefox."" How do I solve this? Besides this, everythings run perfectly well."
2617,Denitza Banchevska,"October 4, 2018",5," I use it for personal things, such as shopping lists, planning home reconatructions, notes, writing and organizing work ideas. I find it very versatile and user friendly. Thank you for the great app!"
2618,Zombie RC,"October 15, 2018",3, I'd give it a solid 5 stars if only you guys take care of the Arabic text allignment. It's a real pain in the ass to use the same allignment as English for Arabic texts. Arabic goes from right to left not the other way as English.
2619,Rick Henderson,"April 16, 2019",1, The latest versions are broken on my Note 9. Updated notes aren't syncing and saving. Search won't work. Clicking on any note causes the app to freeze. Then I tried using the web version and they don't support Android browsers.
2620,Pavel Yernazarov,"January 2, 2019",4, Enjoying the app. Webclip is the most useful tool. But recently the App has disallowed to create bullet points in the notes on Android phones. The option to create bullet points has became inactive. Would be nice to solve this bug. Thx!
2621,Lawrence Ossi,"April 10, 2019",1," IMPOSSIBLE TO USE! Both of my devices keep blanking out... saying ""connecting to Google Play"". Why, on Earth, does it need to constantly keep connecting to Google Play? I can't enter an entire word without this happening."

2623,matt mungrin,"February 6, 2019",3, It's obviously my go to app to write however it is so annoying when the app changes my words into gibberish when I don't ask it to. if I misspell something and try to correct it the app will add letters to mess everything up. I wish there was a way to turn that off.
2624,Derrick Tardy,"April 3, 2019",1," Its horrible. Always froze up, very hard to cut and paste more than 10 sentences, if you have mediocre internet connection, dont use this app! the more updates, the worse it become. I am switching to something else"
2625,Lena Ng,"June 9, 2019",2," used to love it but it has been hanging a lot each time i use it of late and after updating it, it did not perform any better. Please fix the bug. Also, could you perhaps allow a sub-bullet function? The bulleting/ numbering function is not very intuitive."
2626,Andy R,"June 12, 2019",1," I've been a paying Evernote user for years, I use it a lot and used to love it, but recently it's become a lot slower and more flaky. I can no longer recommend it to people and I'm seriously considering looking elsewhere for my note taking needs."
2627,Tomas Laboutka,"June 19, 2019",1," It takes six seconds to load the individual note (not the app). the reminders on the desktop version have been burried deep in the menu, making almost unusable. after years of loyalty, it's time to..Quip?"
2628,Riz S,"June 28, 2019",5," it's unbelievable when your favorite app becomes your worst nightmare. absolutely no support from Evernote, all they say is they escalated the ticket and they're looking into it. How many years does a person have to wait to get an issue resolved."
2629,Frances Columbo,"July 23, 2019",3," Evernote does not necisarily work when pressibg the ""buttons"" and some posts WILL NOT OPEN NO MATTER WHAT OR HOW LONG YOU WAIT! I purchased the bigger package and cant say i get better service but it does hold alot more posts which is my livelyhood! So please keep my Evernote working! Thank you!"
2630,Brinder Dhanoa,"July 16, 2019",3," New update keeps asking you to upgrade to premium and you can't go back from that page. In order to use the app, you've to close and open it again. I'm going to give you guys a month to rectify this predatory method. After that I'm uninstalling it."
2631,Patrick Hart,"September 24, 2019",2, Freezes at least twice everyday. It's the only program that freezes on my macbook pro. Such a shame that they are not addressing this after repeated requests from customers. Still no improvements. I'm seriously looking for another solution because this app is too buggy for me.
2632,Bianca Aldrich,"August 11, 2019",5," I absolutely love Evernote. I created the habit of taking notes of books and articles that I read in this app (sometimes adding pictures, so I dont have to text).I have those notes available to me anytime I want."
2633,Monica Leal Isla Flores,"August 6, 2019",3," Overall it's a good note taking app, if anything it's a little restrictive. Also, it doesn't support note taking with a stylus which is a big miss because that would give it a more notebook like feel."
2634,Janusz Kilian,"August 17, 2019",2," i had been a fan, used premium for years. but recently i find the application non performing, saving and opening notes often hangs my device our takes very long time. so i cannot rely on it as much as i used to. disappointing."
2635,James Riedel,"August 20, 2019",5, Well my memory isn't too good so this is a great app. I can record my thoughts and go back and find them. I can make list of things I want to do. I can make list of books I want to read and things I want to do in my retirement. I'm 76 years old and retired. I love this app and it's free
2636,R3Pulsive _,"August 24, 2019",4," Simple to use, simple to understand. Tools are not in a jumble and the contrast between white and green makes it easy on the eyes. Overall the app accomplishes what it is meant to do; storing."
2637,Brittany Smith,"September 14, 2019",5," This app is amazing!!! I have been using it since 2014 and appreciate the ease the app gives you to organize items into notebooks. You can save text, pictures and so much more! Definitely recommend this app!"
2638,Ace,"September 18, 2019",5, Excellent app does everything they say it does no issues at all love it. I only use it for myself and l sync between my phone and my laptop that's all and so far l am happy with this app. Even when l change phones my data is kept intact.
2639,Paul Young,"October 28, 2019",2," I want the Notebooks view to be the default view when you open Evernote. There should be more flexibility in this. It is not very useful to see a disorganized jumble of All Notes when you open the App. Lots of good features, but the default view should be customizable."
2640,J Bone,"October 31, 2019",1," Is there no way to set a recurring reminder? If there is, it's certainly not very intuitive, like many of the other features in the app."
2641,Alejandro Giraldo Rozo,"December 9, 2019",5, This app is amazing. Does more than expected.
2642,Aditya Dwivedi,"December 25, 2019",5," well designed, offering a lot for a free app. Scope of improvement in allowing font sizes and colours"

2646,Sekhar Baidya,"December 22, 2018",4," Currently my default note-taking app for Android. It's good, though I think the user interface could have been a little better. But I am not gonna lie, it has got some pretty good features and a clean interface. Definitely recommended."
2647,John Norris,"September 18, 2018",3, When you update a file on a second tablet you shouldn't find it rewritten over by the first next time it's opened. Wasted wasted time and effort. You have to copy n paste to reserve files all the time because edit events are not prioritised by event time
2648,Brandon Wise,"October 24, 2018",2," I've been using this for over 2 years and now I can't even log into my account without ""upgrading"" to a paid plan because I'm on android. Please fix this and change it back. Thanks."

2650,Carissa Schmidt,"June 8, 2019",5," A great app for organization and project management. I'd love a feature to skip to the end of notes, though - I've got a few which are very long, and the scroll can be annoying when it keeps thinking I'm tapping to type."
2651,Prakash V,"December 26, 2018",4," Very good note app. But I like the main view to be compact, where I can see as many notes in one page. I turn off everything in the View Options for this compact view but it doesn't work anymore since an update couple of months back."

2653,Curtis Stewart,"November 25, 2018",5, This app is super helpful. I use it all the time with no major issues. One thing that's not working right now is the new dark theme though. My navigation bar is just black. The buttons still work but I can't see them.
2654,Alyssa the Strawberry,"October 31, 2018",5," Great for taking and organizing notes. Able to share notes with other users. Sync function is great across PC and phones. I would like better it if they had better options to customize the widget (I.e. colors of the note, etc)."
2655,Matt Yamasaki,"October 5, 2018",1," The idea of the app is good, but both the Android and web versions are incredibly buggy. The formatting is essentially non-functional. Very frustrating experience."

2657,Puja Kundu,"June 21, 2019",5," Its amazing! Best part of this app is that I get my notes back as soon as I login into the account, on any device! So I dont have to worry about loosing my notes when I change my phone or laptop."
2658,kevin khy,"June 28, 2019",5, I've been using the app for many years since I was in college back in 2011 & I've always liked it. They've consistently added features like being able to search attachments. The shared notebooks are super helpful to use with family members & for planning trips
2659,SimoneBilesJr,"July 9, 2019",5, It's perfect for deeper writing. I don't believe there are any ads. They even let you put a password. You can use different notebooks for different writing and it's great to use if it is not just a quick note.
2660,Del Ratcliffe,"July 20, 2019",5," I love Evernote - I use it daily for work and personal records, on every device I have. It is convenient, fast and amazingly powerful - I can't imagine going back to working without it!"
2661,Ted Schiele,"July 30, 2019",5," my life is stored in Evernote. I wouldn't be doing that if it didn't work or I didn't trust it. Could be better with some features, little things like bookmarks within notes, but overall I can definitely recommend it."
2662,Xenaida Fowler,"July 9, 2019",3," I think this is a great app, but the tutorial will not show me how to draw such as with the touch screen. If someone could explain how to use the drawing part of the app, I would gladly change my review."
2663,Zena Matthews,"August 3, 2019",5," I love Evernote! I use it for to-do-lists, to-buy-lists, wish lists, writing my feelings, doctor and physical therapist notes, relationship goals, personal work goals. It's easy and practical and I can access it from the phone and any computer."
2664,Reema D'souza,"August 6, 2019",5," Being a person who takes a lot of notes, this app has made my life easier. I love the interface, it is easy to use. The best part is synching of documents across devices. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes taking notes."
2665,Casey Ho,"August 5, 2019",2," this app keeps on crashing and freezing for windows and andriod to the extent where it gets frustrating and annoying. However, I like the format and the features provided in the app which are really helpful for note taking. I hope they improve their installation for non-iOS users."
2666,Chantelle Monzon,"August 13, 2019",5, I love this app! I use it for novel planning because of the great templates and reliable storage. It can connect to Google Drive as well which is great for me because I love Google Drive but it was missing what this app has.
2667,D McIntyre,"August 21, 2019",3," Used to be an excellent app. While I like the different features, in the last few months it's laggy especially when I'm trying to edit my notes and it freezes all the time. Very annoying."

2691,LILY hoang,"October 18, 2019",3, Wanted to test out the functions to see if it easy relevant to what I needed but couldn't without leaving my cc for automatic subscription and now it doesn't have an option to cancel subscription in the app. I had to email them to inform them I do not wish to continue with subscription.
2692,Elena Graves,"October 8, 2019",5," Great app for note-taking! I love the many things that you can do with it to organize your notes just the way you want it. Other apps don't have bullet points as an option, but Evernote does! I love this app for school and personal use!"
2693,Matt Marcinczyk,"October 24, 2019",1, Won't open existing notes (green waiting circle) and has trouble creating new notes. The problem has been happening for over a week now. I have deleted app and reinstalled but the problem persists. I have always loved this app but with this problem it is unusable.
2694,Ahmed Owais,"October 30, 2019",1, The worst thing about this app and which push me to uninstall is it could not be used offline. One note is better then Evernote.
2695,Ankur Gupta,"December 22, 2019",5, Wonderful place to save notes
2696,Jerry Luna,"January 18, 2020",5," One of the bestest applications on the market, I've been using this awesome application for years now and intend to use it for many years to come 📊📈📄👍😁📉"
2697,Mycroft H,"January 22, 2020",1," Very buggy. Freezes, losses data when you save. Just a no from me."
2698,Sawan Gupta,"November 16, 2018",2, It is giving me a webpage load error when I am going in the manage points tab. This is happening from the past few weeks. I am not able to use the points for premium sub.

How do you turn a free product to a product one must pay for without warning? Why can't I access my information!?This is out of order. I will never use Everynote again, payed or free. Even if I do pay, nobody assures me that my information won't be held rancam for more money. That's what you have done now!"
2701,A Google user,"December 17, 2018",5," This app is great for keeping all sorts of notes organized and convenient. I love being able to access all of my lists, references, important information across several devices."
2702,Kim Hobbs,"October 12, 2018",5, This app has always been so helpful to me. Note anything ND it can be shared by two devices In the free version. Love it. No matter the phone or computer I have gotten Evernote is always first to be installed.
2703,Nathan Langdon,"September 20, 2018",5," I really like the camera feature. It let's me take pictures of slides in class and put them in my notes. However, I would be really great ful if there was a size adjustment feature for photos."
2704,Richard Durishin,"November 21, 2018",5," Evernote has been a mission critical part of my work and personal life since 2007. There simply is no better tool for saving information I need, however infrequently I may need it, or for keeping notes on my projects and clients. And... Yay! Dark Mode!"
2705,Sam Xpand,"September 19, 2018",4, The best organizer for me. However I'll rate it 5 stars if you can add the ability to toggle between 2 accounts without having to sign out of one and sign into another.
2706,Davide Antonicelli,"March 3, 2019",1," top note taking app that is terrible at taking handwritten notes. handwriting is laggy, makes it unusable. also could have note features. handwritten notes from pc can't be edited on android.... ridiculous,no continuity."
2707,Paa Kwesi Appau,"May 6, 2019",5, This app has one of the best planning and organizational tools. I've changed my phone twice but haven't lost any data because of the account sync. A great centralized planning tool
2708,Daniel LaCombe,"October 1, 2018",3, It's decent. Desperately needs an option to change font size and color. How this is excluded is beyond me. Especially when it's a basic feature in other versions. It's almost more effort to remove it.
2709,A Google user,"February 18, 2019",1," I just lost years and years of vital hard work which I refer to and edit daily, when reinstalling after bugs prevented me from copying and pasting and froze the app. Instructions in help did not solve. Still waiting for email reply."
2710,Marina Serebriana,"June 4, 2019",3," Do you have expanded text editing menu for premium account? Like highlighting with different colours, more listing options, columns, tables, headlines etc. Tools to make my text more diverse. This is the only thing lacking on evernote and the only thing I would buy premium for."
2711,Rayden Sia,"May 29, 2019",4," Evernote is great for organizing your notes and information. Everthing is great except for the lack of Tile View for notes, which can make your notes hard to read and access, thus the deduction of 1 star."
2712,Jeanne Gonzalves,"June 29, 2019",4," Evernote is amazing, but minus one star for a critical feature: search on mobile! most of the time it just spins and spins. the reason fornuaing itnis to have everything I want to remember at my fingertips, so lack of search results defeats the purpose."
2713,Kartik Dhiman,"July 26, 2019",5," AWESOME. Highly recommended. Anything you do online on Evernote website, automatically comes into the application you can install on your PC, and mobile phone. Better functions than MS-WORD, easy management."
2714,Kay de-Caux,"July 21, 2019",3, this app is very clever with very good features and ideas. I would love for there to be visible tabs rather than stacks but that is just me. more than anything it would be perfect if we could colour code our stacks and categories!
2715,Etienne Pretorius,"July 16, 2019",5," Evernote is awesome I have been a subscriber to Evernote for a few years now. I have not yet fully tested the share capabilities with a team. However I do use it extensively, but not exclusively, for all journals and notes."
2716,markinbarnet1,"August 5, 2019",1," I have NEVER used this App! I don't want this pre-loaded App, but Samsung/Vodafone/Google force me to have it and it can't be uninstalled! It clutters my phone, wasted my memory and wastes my time, wading through the pre-installed unwanted clutter! :-("
2717,cerb,"August 27, 2019",5, Ive been using this app since high school. Its really the best way to keep your notes ready with you either on the go or on your desktop. Its best used for researching materials because you can clip articles and web pages so easily.
2718,Rick Blanco,"September 5, 2019",5," Everything is pretty good except the pc web app. It doesn't have a save feature so you have to wait for it to automatically make the save for you, and it often lags and doesn't save properly."
2719,Elaine B,"September 21, 2019",5," I use this app to track my inventory of Stamps, dies and all my craft supplies. Love how easy it is to use, love that I can take pictures and have a record of everything. Great app!!!"
2720,Ana,"December 11, 2019",1," Why are we must buy the product when we using vivo? But when we using another mobile phone, it's can be used for free.."
2721,Naveed Alam,"January 6, 2020",5, Very Good and helping app but once i lost the data and i could not recover it from backup as well😢 That was great loss
2722,Adrian Constantin,"February 23, 2020",2," Only 2 devices allowed now ? You are greedy ! I have a phone + a tablet + gaming computer + my parents computer. Not to mention I would like to access my notes when at work too, plus as a software developer I have virtual machines and dual-boot Windows + Linux on my physical machines"
2723,carriacou37,"March 15, 2019",1," what a bother!! tried to use it across my devices. keep getting, ""unsync"", sign out, etc. i got rid of it. installed colornote and it seems fine. we'll see.  i'm done with this app tho!!!"
2724,prathamesh khadse,"November 13, 2018",5," Widget in notification bar makes it easier to use, works great for to-do lists, journalling. I use Evernote on a daily basis, the free version is enough for an average user."
2725,mrinal shrivastav,"May 22, 2019",5, The application is easy to understand and the experience is hassle free. You may add an option of text size and text alignment in the editing. Those features will help make the notes more arranged. Thank you.
2726,A Google user,"November 30, 2018",4," It's great to organize my complex notes and other things from my notebooks, but I cannot save any templates -wich would be very useful and practical- it says that it cannot be saved."
2727,HARI GANESH,"March 5, 2019",5," Its good to take notes of any kind in terms of images, writings etc; I really love the user interface and something can be done in dark mode to enhance user interface"
2728,Kevin Fast,"October 6, 2018",1," Evernote is useless if I can't Cut & Paste. What use is a ""note"" app if you can't do anything with it after it is created. I had high hopes for Evernote but I have never been so frustrated and disappointed in my life."
2729,Siddhu Vankayala,"September 18, 2018",2," Everything is great except for one bug. When i try to edit a word from the middle of two letters, every letter is changing in that word and causing a chaos. Fix it and I'll give a 5."
2730,Sreenath Pradeep,"March 23, 2019",3, Loved the app! Great way to organize stuff and store things in parallel. I think you should make a lite version of this app which uses less system memory.
2731,Matthijs Gałażyn,"November 18, 2018",1," Ridiculously slow and resource hogging. When editing notes UI is very glitchy, e.g. note goes by itself to edit mode, when I just want to tick a checkbox. I moved to Google Keep and I'm 100x happier with the UX."
2732,luke waite,"March 18, 2019",1, I've just had an email from the creators of this app saying there has been some suspicious activity on my Evernote account I find this hard to believe as it is disabled on my fone as I have never used this app and I never will so good luck to anyone trying hack it as there is no useful info on there
2733,Tommy Anderson,"March 7, 2019",5," It's fantastic! Very convenient, efficient & easy to use! I LOVE the option to add a passcode, etc. to access or even get a glimpse at any of my personal content in the app. AWESOME!!!"
2734,Nick Welch,"May 20, 2019",3, I've been using this as my note taking app of choice for years but alas it suddenly doesn't work properly with predictive text on my phone. It's almost impossible to write anything.
2735,A Google user,"December 11, 2018",3, During search the highlight scrolls down while moving down instead of being fixed to the word. That way the search function is only usable for top portions of the page. Fix the bug please!
2736,Travis Barber,"December 16, 2018",1, PLEASE FIX THE KEYBOARD TYPING/ SPACING/ INDENTATION/ DELETING/ WORD DOUBLING PROBLEM ON THE NOTE 9!!!!!!!! I have been using this app for years now and never have I been more frustrated with thIs app than I am now!!!!! Such a headache!!!!!!!!
2737,A Google user,"March 15, 2019",5," Sticking with this app for all these years has been worth it. Not only has the UX/UI always been smooth, but I'm sure others will agree when I say Evernote ""just works"" somehow. Big thanks and congrats to everyone behind it!"
2738,Tye Z,"November 16, 2018",2," A *subscription* for pro features? REALLY?? Pro features would likely be good enough to pay for and buy the app, but who needs another monthly bill just to take notes?!? No thanks...uninstalling."

2740,Doug Heritage,"June 25, 2019",2," I've been using premium for years but lately the mobile app has been slow to open notes, some times they never open and often the app crashes. I'm up to date on software and OS. What gives, EN?!"
2741,Michael Chuah,"August 5, 2019",1, Used to be very useful but now every time you open the app it post subscriptions! How do you expect us to read our notes? Kindly explain. Thank you. Hope you can remove the subscription ads
2742,Kay Burnett,"July 10, 2019",5, I use this to keep notes I will use in my blogs or for info of intrest. the only problem I run into is in the app it's hard to copy something I have and want to paste it on to another app that I'm already into. like I want to copy a link on to a Twitter post I'm already in.
2743,Thad Ritch,"August 6, 2019",4," Cant access offline without paying. Competing apps like the one that came on my phone, will allow offline access and syncing for free though. The saving grace of Evernote is that it automatically sorts the most recent note first, which is helpful for my needs."
2744,Dan Beech,"August 9, 2019",4," Only 4 stars because of a bug that prevents shared notebooks from being searched (Android). Developers have known about this for over 1 year. Overall, it's a great app."
2745,Jason Perkey,"August 18, 2019",5, Have used it for years to keep track of various notes for my family. The iOS and Windows versions work well also; we chose this since we have many different devices in our household.
2746,Abhishek Jadav,"August 20, 2019",5," Evernote is amazing, to make best use of it read the book ""Getting things done"" and apply GTD principles with your everynote. FYI, it would be even better if Evernote had a proper remind and to do list features to sync with google calender etc something like to-do ist"
2747,ruplaci,"August 15, 2019",5, I had concerns regarding any app like this until I did not try. I really like to use it on my android phone / my ipad and macbook at the same time. Share notes with others and build the project on a more efficient way. Bonus to have work chat. Thanks
2748,Nicolas Capparelli,"September 3, 2019",5," Easy to use, syncs across devices seamlessly. The best use of this for me is to read Textbook PDFs for school, and just copy and paste the important parts into an Evernote note for that chapter. Dark mode adds an extra star so 5/5 from me."
2749,Bongumenzi Manana,"September 22, 2019",2," This is a great app. However, recently I've been having problems viewing or editing notes which are a bit long. Such actions cause the app to crash which is a bit unfortunate because this was the main reason I have been using this app all along"

2751,Zack Website,"October 28, 2019",5, I've been using evernote for 6 years and it's pretty remarkable that ive never lost a note or idea since then ! Its such a great tool for organizing personal ideas and to-do lists that I've never had to replace it.

2761,Pedro Canino Aguado,"January 8, 2019",4," Can you fix the ""Dark mode"" COMPATIBILITY ISSUE with the ""add notes from notification bar"" feature?

2762,Rudy Hugo,"November 11, 2018",5," great app! Helped enormously when I had an IRS audit. Unfortunately, an old credit card tried to renew and my Evernote subscription was dropped. No easy way to renew with a new card......guys, you have to fix this.....Android user btw"
2763,Judy O.,"December 26, 2018",2," Was nice at first. Glitchy now. When I open a not and hit ""edit,"" the cursor and entire app freezes for several moments, and will let you do nothing. Then eventually it releases and allows you to type."
2764,Johnny Raven,"December 18, 2018",1, This application was perfectly fine with the adds and other sundry items to use for free. now I can't use it anymore without purchasing it. screw this application. moving to another app that's actually free.

2767,Anna Sundeep,"April 12, 2019",5, we can edit the text in different ways. It will automatically detect any text in the pics. So that it's easy to save any text from pics you shoot from your mobile.
2768,Gabe Sendejas,"September 17, 2018",5," Made the switch from many note taking apps. Best decision I've made. I know it sounds weird but do me the favor and take the time to learn the eco system of the app itself. Once you do, you'll realize how incredible this note taking software is. Enjoy."
2769,Kenneth Lloyd,"September 20, 2018",2, Pushes you to upgrade to a paid subscription but doesn't make the pricing structure easy to find. Apparently they hope people will sign up without asking how much it costs and then just not cancel after the first bill.
2770,Shane Weigel,"March 8, 2019",2, Great app. Impossible to get ahold of support. $70 per year is a little ridiculous for a note taking app was fine with paying $50 for the last few years.
2771,Nadya Heilmann-Jespersen,"April 29, 2019",2," I keep getting a pop up where it says Evernote stopped working, close, wait or a third option. This happen almost everytime I by mistake make the page turn while moving my phone.. Please fix since I love this app."
2772,Jeff Meurer,"May 7, 2019",2, It was a great app but over time it has lost its gloss and others have caught up. Free version being restricted to two devices is finally what made me search for a new note app. OneNote is now my preferred note app.
2773,Gilberto Gaeta,"April 15, 2019",1, Making cross-device sync a premium feature behind a paywall was definitely NOT a good idea. It is however a great way to drive app uninstalls and lose market share to Google Keep and other note apps. Very disappointing
2774,Agus Haryawan,"May 30, 2019",3," I used Evernote Plus for almost 3 years, but now it's gone. I can not continue using Plus Version. The Premium version is too expensive for me. How can I continue using Evernote Plus?"
2775,Yohanas,"June 21, 2019",1," This app is so buggy and does not work. I switched to Android from iOS. Bear on iOS is 100x better. So disappointed. It constantly crashes, freezes, and randomly changes the font within my documents."

2778,Mark Brough,"July 25, 2019",2," Because Evernote is the most important app on your phone, and because the self-obsessed developers are so proud of it - if you have Evernote open, your screen will stay on. Until your battery is dead. With no warning, and no way to reconfigure it."

2782,Clifford Berg,"August 28, 2019",1," WAY too many gadgets, buttoms and options. Its just too much to set up. This is SUPPOSED to be for convenience; but it takes so much to just even make a text and save it. Im done with it."
2783,Jordi Palá,"September 27, 2019",2, Keeps filling my internal memory even after moving the app to the external SD card. Not an option to choose the storage that the app is using. Clipping fails sometimes. A method to try again would be useful.
2784,Miami Roller Hockey,"September 26, 2019",2, Love it when it actually works. But it keeps freezing up on my Chromebook and I have had to switch to another application instead. Shame they haven't corrected this yet. They will continue to bleed customers until they fix it.
2785,Nicole Zion,"October 13, 2019",4," Been using evernote for approx. 2-3 years now and it's been a wonderful experience. The first place I run to when I need to get something down, whether an idea, shopping list or quick doodle. Recommended"

2788,AKHILES S.,"October 22, 2019",1," Useless as an app. Clunky and cumbersome to use features such as moving notes, tags, and worse it's slow to retrieve your notes. The desktop/Web version has improved by leaps and bounds since a few years."
2789,L19H7,"October 21, 2019",4," Great app. But it's hard to manage notes when you have them more than 500. I constantly look for alternatives with better tagging and files support. A BTW, it can not markdown, which is minus for me."

2795,Robert Rice,"March 24, 2019",5, I've been using this app for 8 years now and it's the best there is. Evernote is THEE leader in note taking applications and has been for a long time. It continues to get better and I've never received an update that I didn't like.
2796,Victor Cornejo,"February 19, 2019",5," Simple to use and ubiquitous access to notes created on tablets, desktops, laptops or other Android devices. The most used app on my phone next to email and calendars."
2797,Joseph Mcqueen,"July 26, 2019",5, Never used it much on android but thought it would have S pen integration. Would love some handwriting. Using this once again and with premium it is a whole new story compared to basic. Just a few bucks a month convent it into the best sync app with note taking functionalities.
2798,Hugh Twycross,"January 12, 2019",3," Really like a lot of the features on the app, especially the tag system. However, for filing notebooks it would be much easier if you could create stacks within stacks! This feature would be greatly appreciated!"
2799,Kuanysh Temirgaliyev,"December 6, 2018",5," Great app. I got commentary regarding dark mode. Quick note on galaxy s8 remains white but font color is pale, just like inside the app, when dark mode is on.  It makes quick note is very hard to use"

2844,Khaleed Khalfan,"August 29, 2019",4," Great app if you have the web clipper. My work doesn't allow browser extensions. On mobile it doesn't do a very good job of collecting/saving the right information. But, having things saved in Evernote is great for looking up later."

3035,Richard Jimenez,"October 27, 2018",2," I like apps that are all in one service with Max efficiency, once they start promoting a premium service, that pretty much makes me feel forced to pay in order to get Max efficiency I delete it."
3036,Kurtus Kahle,"December 26, 2018",2," Lots of features, but buggy enough that it's almost unusable. It won't sort reminders by date, it wont properly mark reminders as done...finding another app."

3042,Bryan Chance,"October 28, 2018",2," How do I disable Evernote from including photos that I take with the stock Android camera app. It is soo slow when i enabled this feature. And of course, the option to disable is nowhere to be found."

3047,Brad Hicks,"August 7, 2019",1, Forcing paid upgrade to use on PC after I purchased the app years ago. Was able to use on any device up until recently. Seems a bit steep for what's an overglorified text editor.
3048,Kate Hillier,"August 26, 2019",1," Slow, clumsy. Evernote don't care and it shows. Using Google Keep but need to be able to transfer notes to Keep. Plus free surveillance technologies so they can serve disgusting ads!"
3049,Tomin Nyodu,"August 22, 2019",4," It's good but yearly payment of ₹1500/- inr is expensive, if looking for long term use of the app. If only after 1st purchase, subsequent annual payment was lesser, say ₹550/- then the price was very justified"
3050,Aashit Garodia,"September 17, 2019",2," CAN'T ATTACH MULTIPLE IMAGES AT A SINGLE TIME, YOU'VE TO SELECT IT ONE BY ONE.(If you select multiple images from gallery and then share it to Evernote then it will make a new note only.)"

3056,Mr H,"September 3, 2019",1, Interface needs work: why do i need to press the tick button to save notes? On large phone the tick button is too far away. Its annoying. Offline notes only available with paid service? I smell greed.
3057,James McKee,"March 28, 2019",1, Autospell Nightmare. Used to love this app. Now it idiotically autoreplaces every word and number with what it thinks I want to enter which makes it near impossible to use. Please fix!! Samsung S7

3064,Michael Hernandez,"May 24, 2019",2," Pretty good design, the only issue I had was that you have to have a Premium Account to access your notes offline, if not for that I would have given 5 stars."
3065,Mustapha Hassan,"December 29, 2018",5, Basically the number one application in my life and I don't see that changing. Never wrote a review before but I love you guys. Almost 5 years now of using Evernote. Thanks for being there ♥

3067,Greg Pentz,"May 17, 2019",5, I really love Evernote and hope it evolves. Richness of editing needs to improve and the windows app is in need of a refresh but it is still a great cloud solution to organise your notes and build your personal knowledge base

3069,Adya Anurag Das,"April 6, 2019",1," there is no option to come out of free trail or buy now page. If I am satisfied with the basic version, why to go for premium purchase? Just uninstalled it."

3072,Daniel Head,"June 4, 2019",1, This use to be a good app. Only 2 devices or you have to pay. I only used for manuals anyway. I will use my mega app. Removed from most of my devices.
3073,Eugene Dryga,"June 4, 2019",2, Huge battery drain. Last example - evernote was used for 9min and consumed 21% of battery (with using of dark mode). it is just text editor with black screen - how is it possible to discharge the battery so fast?

3078,Andrey Kravchuk,"August 22, 2019",1," It's near to impossible using camera to scan docs, very frustrating. I have to use Office Lens to scan and then import to Evernote, why, why am I paying for this?"
3079,Peg Macaluso-Google Account,"August 16, 2019",5," Lifesaver. Evernote allows me to make notes about everything (errands, info from doctor's visits, things to do). Syncs automatically & can be accessed on my phone, tablet or desktop. LOVE IT."
3080,Maxwell Arieda,"August 29, 2019",4," Absolutely great app. I have it on all my devices (under 3 or you have to pay premium). Only reason its not a 5, is because the homepage isnt aesthetic. You can mess with view settings but its not a lot"
3081,Lea Roded,"August 28, 2019",5," Having a synced note taking app on the go is quite useful. The browser interface is also helpful, for when I'm on a borrowed computer."
3082,Daniel Oshiro,"August 29, 2019",2, There is the worst problem I'm having with my chromebook where the formatting doesn't stay constant and continuously gets bigger in size every time I hit the enter key. Please fix this Evernote!
3083,Nur Adli,"September 8, 2019",1," I love using Evernote, but the mobile app interface is super suck, it's inefficient, moreover the app is so heavy. It took so long to start the app and load notes. Please consider to remake your app."

3087,Twoevete07,"October 27, 2019",5, It's fun to travel back in time which made me laugh as I read old letters I had made. Evernote has known me ever since never have to try this before. Was some kind of spying me on my history. EVERNOTE!

3090,Millie Johnson,"February 10, 2019",1, I am disappointed this app gave me no choice but to enroll in a free 7 day trial. They will bill me unless I opt out. So now I have another task to keep track of. I also will add a task to look for a new note app.
3091,Vickie Balder,"January 19, 2019",1, I loved this when I first got it 4 years ago now I changed phones and when I looked in no more free version. can't even get to my notes. I won't pay for this POS ever! Never worth $70 a yr
3092,A Google user,"January 6, 2019",5," A much awaited feature of multiple images reordering and rearranging in android is still missing. Screenshots,book scan or other images random order in a note render the note useless. kindly incorporate this feature too."

3096,Abhiraj Pattem,"May 26, 2019",1," I am planning to switch to some different app. This app is so choppy and glitchy, cant write even one sentence without correcting it 7-8 times. I used to love evernote but the app version is killing me."
3097,Sriram K NALLANIDGAL,"January 27, 2019",3," It has been working as expected, I was happy with the app till yesterday(almost one year)...now they wanted me to upgrade else I can't access my data...so uninstalling app."

3099,Donna Corley,"June 15, 2019",1, I loved this app for years but now it won't even let me add to my files I have stored. It keeps freezing up then just shuts down the app!

3107,Gabrielle Palmer,"August 21, 2019",1," There is a constant database Read/Write Error, that won't get resolved, and notes I've saved have been deleted when the app is updated. Very unsatisfying."

3130,Endermen17,"November 13, 2018",4, You should add a print option on this app. Im sure it would benefit anybody who decides to print something they like on Evernote. Other than that it's a really good app and I love it!

3132,Mukund,"September 22, 2018",3, Note should be editable only when we explicitly click an edit icon. In the new update the note enters edit mode by just clicking on the note content which is not desirable.

3135,Farit Mutugullin,"May 2, 2019",1, The ”a” menu button is a horrible UX decision. These tools should be self-explanatory or be copied to right menu. There wasn't any quick intro to this upon the first launch.
3136,Hikmah Az,"April 10, 2019",1," I paid for this app and now it won't let me write. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I finished typing a word and press space, the word DISAPPEARS. I can't even write a proper sentence. and don't blame my keyboard because I'm using Samsung keyboard and I can type this review just fine. DO SOMETHING."
3137,Nathan Varghese,"June 11, 2019",3, I think it will be a tad better if there was an option to lock the note in its place. I am quite often annoyed when I wish to scroll down and I end up in the editting mode.
3138,Carlos Hernández,"June 15, 2019",4," Pasting text from Evernote adds extra spaces betweem paragraphs, it's annoying and time consuming to be removing the spaces everytime you need to copy and paste text somewhere else."
3139,Kirk Nichols,"July 5, 2019",2, Essentially unusable. Lags repeatedly with large notes while phone outside of app performs perfectly on galaxy s9+. Wait time to respond is about a minute and you have about 20 seconds to type until it's hung up again.
3140,Jatin Chakravarti,"July 12, 2019",5," All notes at one place, irrespective of the platform or OS. I've been using it since 4 years now. Always handy."

3142,Samvit Mahashay,"September 17, 2019",1," Poor performance. Always asks for premium service. After each two minutes, request for primihm plan will pop up. Desperate to earn but no proper delivery of good service. Not worth installing."
3143,David wyatt,"September 18, 2019",1," Sadly on the decline,keeps getting worst,now has annoying bug where mid typing jumps to top of the note, time to move to keep it onenote, both better and not limited to number of devices"
3144,Willie,"September 18, 2019",5," I am a very long time user of Evernote. I love this app! I am a foreign language learner, and Evernote has helped me to increase my abilities rapidly. I highly recommend Evernote to anyone who is interested in a note taking, web clipping app."
3145,Emmanuel Jesuyon Dansu,"September 23, 2019",5, Evernote has been one of my best apps since I discovered it around 2012/2013. It helps me to be care-free about saving my vital documents as I can always access them across devices.

3148,Koyko Black,"October 1, 2019",5, I use that app for almost 3 years. It's great for make notes and most importantly for me structure them. I also like quick note which is very useful tool P.s. what about add opportunity to choos several notebooks at once? Thanks
3149,Fred Looney,"October 8, 2019",5, This is a secure notepad that is very handy because of being able to group individual note into notebooks and I never need to worry about what device the data is stored on on in what folder.
3150,uyi ima-edomwonyi,"October 8, 2019",4, Excellent for all the screen grabs from the many articles I read and wannt to reference later. Would have given 5 star but frequently have too wait for the note to open on my phone.
3151,Mehul Kava,"November 20, 2019",5, Perfect app for your daily use
3152,David Proctor,"January 10, 2020",5, Easy for an old person to negotiate

3154,Suraj A,"November 22, 2018",4, Dark mode is cool but what would be even better is dark mode being actual black color instead of the gray color. That will actually make a difference in amoled screens and look cooler.
3155,Elaine L,"October 7, 2018",4," Can we please have a button or smt that allows user to go to the bottom of the note, or even where it was last edited, in an instant ??? I have notes that I add to daily and they're getting super long. A function like this would save a lot of scrolling effort."

3202,John P Nelson,"June 10, 2019",4," Syncs reliably. But android app is deficient: text size constantly changing, no read-only mode so keyboard keeps popping up trying to use it giving talks, checkboxes look like Google keep but are not so functional."

3204,Walid Fandi,"June 28, 2019",5, Evernote is probably the most powerful app on the market that helps keep your notes and workflow organized and up-to-date. It is also very user-friendly and that's why I love using it.

But I'm stuck using my phone because my tablet isn't supported. I've been using Google Docs more because I don't have much of a choice. I'm a writer. And using my phone is super hard.

3230,Kate Cowden,"January 19, 2019",1," I spent 6 hours making changes and updating a paper. I went to bed, got up the next morning and nothing had been saved. 6 hours down the drain due to a syncing and saving error. This is not the forst time that has happened but it ia certainly the last."

3240,Grant Chu,"August 30, 2019",5, Great app. I tell anyone who is willing to listen about it. I consider it supplemental memory. I use it for work and personal notes. Maybe I don't need to worry so much about my fading memory.

No way to contact evernote unless you are a paying member. 2 step verification can't be set up and I can't even contact them to troubleshoot it. Absolute joke of a company. Do not put anything personal in your notes because this App is NOT SAFE!
3245,River Wang,"October 9, 2019",1," I am rating the web app, or the whole service.It did not do auto save at all and there is no save button. I have been working on a document for a hour and everthing was just gone all of a sudden even without a page refresh. What should I say? Bye bye!"

3278,Rizki Amalia,"September 12, 2019",3, Suddenly this app always offering premium trials and cannot back to basic one just because the back button option didn't work. I can't open the existing note that already saved here :(
3279,Jimmy Rossow,"September 16, 2019",2, Complete lack of synchronization between the app and browser version. Makes it impossible to get work done. This product is a toy.

3379,Saeed Habibi,"February 26, 2020",3," All the pros and cons aside, Evernote still doesn't support rtl text formatting, even though lots of users have been asking for it for years. Does this mean they don't care about their users or what?"
