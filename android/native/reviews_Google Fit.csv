I don't like it nearly as much now with the move minute go replaced by a step goal. Why? I don't walk. I cycle and ski. I get zero steps on the bike. What is the point of a goal I can never hit? I understand that steps works better for many people, but please bring back the ability to use move minutes instead of steps. Why not just give us a choice?"

I love the journal feature, showing the map of my route, the steps, minutes, and miles, so I can look at my runs and walks from all angles. I like that it also tracks the minutes. I've double checked the distance in multiple ways and found it quite accurate, usually, with the exception being laps around a track and other quicker turning routes. I enjoy the day, week, and month views. I also appreciate that it tracks workouts that begin before midnight and end after as a complete workout, in the journal view. A+++ 5 stars!"

They claim this update was as a result of customer feedback but from reading these latest reviews I'd say that's highly unlikely. Please put it back to how it was. Or at least give users the option of which they'd prefer."

Now it tracks steps instead of movement, so makes sense only for those lucky enough to be able to count their activities by step counter. Why take away a vital tool for the less able to pander to the most able who can easily choose from a wide range of step counters. Ah, I see your response. The step counters have the priority despite having so many other apps that count steps. You have made your point."

Bring back time goal. Step count it's a pointless goal, at least give people the choice to select what they want to aim for instead of just deciding what you think it's best for us. Also how can you think changing the goal to steps is a good idea when most of the world can't leave the house????"

I liked using this app to track my workouts and making sure I am getting enough minutes of exercise in everyday, but I don't do steps everyday. Why can't you make it so that we can set goals for Move Minutes and Steps?? Or be able to choose one or the other?? That way everyone would be happy."

But I also want to include the fact that, although it still tells me when I've earned extra heart points, they've removed the data to tell me how many extra points which I used as a target. I have sent this to them in the in app feedback but do not expect to get this changed. Update. Now when I try to open a days activity in my journal the app closes down."

Right now a lot of people live in countries where because of coronavirus measures, they can only leave the house for essentials. I have barely left my apartment for a week, but the daily minutes goal was keeping me active. Now the low step count every day is a slap in my face – I'd love nothing more than to be able to go for a walk, but I can't, and Google makes sure to rub it in. Please let users choose between steps and minutes for the main goal, in addition to heart points."
9,David Evans,"April 17, 2020",2," I used to love this app, but the change to track steps rather than move minutes shows the danger of giving people what they want rather than what they need.

Steps may be simpler to track, but there is growing evidence that counting. Steps alone is far too simplistic a way to measure health and fitness. Aerobic exercise can and should come in any form not just walking and needs to be balanced with anaerobic and resistance exercise including yoga and weights based exercise."

After the update suddenly it stopped counting my heart points. during training it'll show how much points I've earned. Then, after an hour of HIIT training, when I finish I see I've earned 0 points for it. What the...? It is a constant problem after the update. Regardless what training I do and it really frustrates me. Also - I need to measure my activity time, switching to step counting app it's stupid as many people (including me) have smart watches that do that already. I used to loved the app. Now I hate it with the power of all the suns."

Since past few days, it has been quite erratic. It displays correct numbers immediately after my walk. However, after an hour or so, it reduces all the numbers including steps, distance, heart points, calorie burnt etc. And there is often another round of reduction a few hours later."

As the only steps I currently can do are my daily walk, it is not representative of the exercise I do, which is mainly strength training, yoga and rowing machine. It's not even representative of my steps as I don't have a fitness watch so it doesn't even count all the steps I do around the flat (I don't always carry my phone). Please make move minutes an option again!"

It tracks weight and other health stuff. I don't like the most recent update which replaced time tracking with steps. Since I ride my bike, do yoga, and martial arts, most of my exercise doesn't meet my daily goal... Only walking or the occasional mile jog are tracked, which includes walking around the grocery store and other activities that I don't consider exercise."

I don't just walk around, I exercise in my living room in a standing position (Yoga for example) which means this app is now useless. Just having a move minutes tracker means nothing without a visual to keep an eye on. I LIKED that it was a GOAL. If you want a steps tracker there are literally dozens (maybe even hundreds!) of others out there use of them instead!!"

It was fine, but now doesn't register distance on my runs, even though it is granted location permission. So I'll probably find something else if I can't resolve this soon.

I'm a tall person with long strides and step really aren't that useful of a measure for me. Neither does it count activities that aren't centered around steps like biking, langlaufen (cross-country skiing, winter) or rowing (summer)! Really why did you do this?! Move minutes as a metric was unique and perfectly suited for measuring overall activity during the day and setting goals for as someone who is active in many different ways, not just walking. This is called an ""activity tracking"" app, right? That includes *all* activities, not just a subset. If I wanted a glorified stepcounter I'd use Pokemon Go or something. Please revert."

I don't wear things on my wrist nor do I carry my phone around with me in my home to track steps. I need a fitness tracker, not just a pedometer. Bleh."

I don't care for the recent update to change move minutes to steps as the daily goal. Some activities I do don't generate many steps such as gardening and yoga. Also while working I don't have my phone on my person so I'm not calculating those steps to help reach my goal. It's discouraging not to see both goals completed. I'd prefer to have move minutes as a goal.

Did you not stop to think maybe being the entire user experience in something that most of us aren't even aloud to do was a bad idea!?! It's a PANDEMIC, removing Move Minutes and forcing me to use Steps means I have no useful way to track my exercise. Thanks Google. 🙄"

While I understand some people might prefer it this way, many people certainly don't. And a feature like a primary goal of an app should either be something universal like move minutes, or preferably should be a choice. So definitely one star until it's fixed, as it's an inexusable mistake."

Also when is the time resetting (like day ending) on the app because even when it's mid night in my area the app shows data from previous day?

I used to love this app as it did not rely on step counting to hit your daily goal, like all the other apps out there, but instead used Active Minutes and Heart Points. A lot of the exercise I do doesn't generate steps. Today for example I have done 40 minutes of weight based Circuits and shot my bow for an hour, so yesterday I would have received 100 Active Minutes and would only have 50 left to reach my goal, but today, none of that counts and I have received 2784 steps instead. Also, with one third of the world currently experience some form of lockdown due to COVID-19, how can it possibly be a good idea to change the way the goal is measured from Active Minutes which can be achieved without leaving the house, to step based targets? Apparently is was done due to user feedback, but I am presuming there are thousands of people out there like me who were very happy with the Active Minute system (steps were also counted!), but didn't bother to mention it so have now lost out. I hope another update will be done so the user can choose between steps and Active Minutes for their goals as so many activities in the WearOS app are now redundant as they don't generate steps. If you just want to measure steps, get a Fitbit, I choose to buy an Android watch as instead as it made more sense to my lifestyle. But not anymore. I am so annoyed!"

Something about ""steps"" being made default for a walk, rather than the obvious and actually useful ""minutes"". Companies and programmers treating their users like this is unacceptable. Whenever a new function is being made available that changes functionality, you just add it as an option. You NEVER push it through users' throats as a new default, and you certainly do not do so by pestering them with a blocking interface the moment they want to use it. Oh and come to think of it; it's about time to add the only proper unit for activities like this, which is calorie. Not ""Calorie"" which apparently is a fake unit taken into use by food ""specialist"" and for some reasons defined as being a 1000 calories. Oh and last note: apparently one can't even change back any more to using minutes for a walk, rather than the utterly useless ""steps"". What is this, Apple Inc.? Uninstalling."

ORIGINAL REVIEW - I hate the update. It is now registering my distance but not my steps - I walked 4.8 miles today but did 58 steps. Cycle rides that I do don't come up automatically anymore until HOURS later or if I connect it to Strava and that's only when it's connected to wi fi. What is going on with this update?

174,Lynn de Koning,"April 21, 2020",2, Last update... Changed the way my move minutes are shown. I do not like the way the app is only counting steps and heart points now. I am recovering from surgery and want to know how long I walk! I do not care how many steps I take. Please let me choose what the app shows!
175,Alan Brehm,"April 24, 2020",1," It used to work well for tracking my workouts. Now it crashes consistently when I try to open past workouts in the journal. I understand this problem has been around for some time, and google isn't addressing it. I'm going to Strava for now."

177,Rae Allen,"April 17, 2020",5," I got the update today and while I mostly use the heart points, think the graphic design of the update to Google Fit is just terrific. Clean, clear and easy to understand. I use the widget on my home screen and can tell how my day is going with just a glance"
178,Keith Howell,"April 20, 2020",1, Was good but then with no notice it changed from setting goals for move minutes to steps. As none of us can go out at the moment this is ridiculous as no credit for exercise bikes etc. There are plenty of step counters out there for those who are wedded to that as their sole fitness target.
179,Graeme Wicks,"April 27, 2020",4, It's great that it's got all these workouts.. But it's missing some key ones... Like push ups and planking.. I think alot of people would appreciate it. As well as showing calories burn next to move minutes and heart points.. So there's a more understandable value to these metrics. Pls and thank you
180,Linkara Crypto,"April 26, 2020",3," So far it seems like just an average ""OK"" app. Nothing like the Fitbit app. It would be great if you could please add Fitbit integration to the app so it can track steps, heart rate, miles, etc more accurately! I will give a better rating if you do this!"
181,Steve Moss,"April 23, 2020",2," Today we went to end our walk in the app and the app crashed. Now every time we try to open it, it crashes right away. It's happening on my phone and my wife's phone. Clearing app cache did not fix it and I don't want to delete data except as a last resort."
182,Michael Akerman,"April 17, 2020",3," All you had to do was make it an option chosen by the user to switch between Move Minutes and steps as their goal. Astonishing to change the fundamental nature of the app and think it's a good idea... Accurate tracker, doesn't drain battery."

184,Anthony Fincher,"April 16, 2020",1," Significantly worse than useless, this app will seriously mislead you. It's attempt to use the GPS doesn't even begin to map your exercise route with any accuracy, in space or time. For example, it showed my 30 minute walk over 1.5 miles as a 6 minute super sprint of 1.3 mi."
185,123212go,"April 25, 2020",1," Like many others have said, this newest update has almost completely broken the app. I can't open any workouts in the journal, and it crashes any time I try to start tracking a workout. What's the point of a fitness app that can't track workouts?"
186,Those Guys,"April 19, 2020",3," UPDATE: Would be nice to track body temperature. PREV: App crashes when viewing/toggling HR data (weeks/months/year).

188,Kaizu,"April 14, 2020",1," The new update made the whole app useless to me. The heart points mean absolutely nothing, and step counter isn't useful to those of us who don't walk/run as an exercise. At least I wished I could choose between goals and not be forced to just count steps."
189,Andrew Taylor,"April 20, 2020",1, I used to love this app as I use it to track my exercise which is mainly cycling focused and this would be recorded as move minutes and heart points but with the current update it records exercise as steps and heart points my problem is that there are no steps in cycling so I only get heart points p...Full ReviewI used to love this app as I use it to track my exercise which is mainly cycling focused and this would be recorded as move minutes and heart points but with the current update it records exercise as steps and heart points my problem is that there are no steps in cycling so I only get heart points please please Google give us the option to choose between steps or move minutes as this app is now redundant for me and of no use I would give the app 5 stars before the update and now 1 star.
190,Vishakha Tekwani,"April 27, 2020",1," Up untill now everything was fine. Why is this new update compulsorily asking me to set a way high target than my average, that too of steps when I am comfortable with minutes. Very disappointed. Will not use it further if the app behaves like this, disregarding my choice and my freedom."
191,Alex Cook,"April 27, 2020",1, The app is fine but recently I haven't been able to start the app without it crashing. I liked the active minutes as I am a biker but they changed that to steps which just doesn't feel as gratifying. Very disappointed in the direction this app is going.
192,Don McIntosh,"April 25, 2020",1, ** update ** Two days later still no fix** Glitching - I just purchased a Google OS/wear watch to better track my fitness and find that the journal entry won't open after the workout. When I push the journal entry button to see the details the app closes out. Needs a fix.
193,D.J. Brien,"April 27, 2020",1," App was working fine, now journal isn't showing 99% of my activity. And the activity it is showing isn't close to being correct. Causing issues syncing with other apps. Already tried the tips in your help section, still not working. Already sent feedback too, no response."
194,Kenneth Hunt,"April 28, 2020",1," I will be installing after years of use. Now out of the blue it's wants me to change goals. And if I don't it doesn't allow me to advance the page, so I can't see any stats. I closed the app and re-opened it to the same page forcing me to change my goals. This complete B.S"
195,Sam Kramer,"April 23, 2020",3," I started an activity and forgot stop, now I cannot adjust the end time. Needs fixing. I go for a ride, 12km, but when I stop the only record's 2km. Seems to be something to do with having my mi band 4 connected, may be it is the mi fit app that is the issue?"
196,Anissa Blanshan,"April 17, 2020",2," App keeps getting worse. Can't personalize it like you use to. Can only set step goals, not movement goals. Last release took away favorite workouts, favorites made it so you could easily track what you do the most, seriously Google. Get some good UI designers."
197,Krill,"April 18, 2020",4, I don't like how the steps goal replaced the move minute goal. It would be better to have the step goal as a additional optional goal rather than replacing the move minute goal. I want to use the move minute goal. I have had no issues so far with the app other than this.
198,Jeremy Westover,"April 23, 2020",2, App used to work well. Just tried to have it track a walk and now the app keeps crashing and it was very wrong on the distance I went. I did a 1.6 mile loop but the app tracked it as 2.56. obviously whatever update was supposed to make it better isn't working.
199,Kinjal Patel,"April 17, 2020",2, Before it was 5 star app app but suddenly in my phone whenever I start walking workout my heart points won't count. It only count steps. Heart points always count zero no matter I walked for 30 minutes or more. I re-installed the app but same problem happening again.
200,Reed Arledge,"April 20, 2020",5, Great app! Love the wide compatibility with 3rd party apps. The only thing I would like to see is real time workout coaching like Samsung health. No coaching means I have to run two apps at once to track with this app and coach with Samsung health.
201,Seth Dowling,"April 22, 2020",3," The workout tracking for watches is great, but the weight lifting portion useless. We need to be able to see sets by exercise and body part along with graphs with personal records and all that. You know, the way every other workout app works."
202,Darrin Armstrong,"April 27, 2020",1," Since the last update I cannot track any activity or input any health data as the app just shuts & exits to homepage. Tried turning phone off & on, tried uninstalling & re- installing, tried clearing storage & cache, nothing changes. Reported on feedback multiple times, waiting for a response."
203,Roman P,"April 26, 2020",2, Extremely simple tracking. You can set goals only for steps and heart points. Nothing else. Heart points is some sort of joke rather than something useful. Would be really nice to have ability to track/set goals only for items I care about.
204,Magdiel Lopez,"April 12, 2020",1, I have both Iphone and Android and compared to Apple health this is horrible. It doesn't even display Blood Sugar levels it doesn't always sync with other apps. This is bad when you think its coming from Google. It should be great but not the case.
205,shara tipton,"April 16, 2020",2, I really hate the new update with the focus on steps - I wish I could delete the step counter altogether! Minutes moved is a better way to track health behaviors than steps. Also right now we are trapped in our homes - natural step counts are decreasing.
206,Victor Mascarenhas,"April 16, 2020",1, Why is this app forcing me to set goals. It will not move forward ifi I do not set a goal. I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Same issue. Please fix this asap or I'm moving on to another app. This thing was working great.
207,Andrea Nardo,"April 18, 2020",2," Poor. Screen turns off during a run, you should keep screen on if i am running and add a speaking voice resume for every kilometre. Also, there is not the possibility to share your workout Map as in other apps. Please add this features and my rate will go up"
208,Malcs,"April 24, 2020",1," Very poor app. Unable to adjust stride length so distance is incorrect. App is pretty much useless. UPDATE, if u read my post u would see that my issue is with adjusting the stride length. So why send me a link that has nothing to do with adjusting stride length?"
209,Ashish,"April 17, 2020",1," I use the phone like while walking indoors these days. But now steps are not getting recorded. 8t used to get recorded before no matter what I was doing.. Only when the phone display is off or when I'm not using any apps , steps are getting recorded"
210,Kristi B.,"April 23, 2020",2," New version was tracking steps and then taking 1000's away. Now, today, when I click on the app it flashes for a second and then disappears! Shows differing numbers each time. Very frustrating!! Please get a fix!!!!"
211,Dan M,"April 16, 2020",2, Terrible update. Google Fit was a downgrade from MyTracks and the last update is another downgrade from the previous version. Many companies make improvements to their apps but in this case it's not so. It's almost as if they want people to use 3rd party apps....I guess for ad revenues.

Think, it's time to say Uninstall."
213,Sherwin Kaplan,"April 28, 2020",2, Sync across devices on same WiFi network is random and can't be relied on. All in all the app is regressing and getting less useful. New design very nice but sync still broken 04/28/20. I will be happy to help you fix it.

215,Chinara Adhofer,"April 17, 2020",1," Really upset with the new update that has removed move minutes in favour of a step counter.

216,M O,"April 18, 2020",1," Atrocious app for reliability. Totally inaccurate. I've wasted a week using this and it never, ever records runs accurately. It is has never shown exactly where I've run. Sorry guys, I need to use something more reliable than this"
217,mark lawson,"April 23, 2020",1, Love this app. Until it won't load on my phone anymore. Considering it is a Google phone I didn't think I'd run into that issue. Just keeps telling me it is stopping. Done the normal troubleshooting.
218,Stacey Collins,"April 23, 2020",1," Very disappointed with the latest update. I have no need to count steps. Heart points, move minutes, & miles are much more important to me. Plus now it keeps CRASHING! Bad move Google, very bad.move. I may need to uninstall & find a new app"
219,Phil Gladman,"April 26, 2020",3," I love this app because it keeps a track of my steps and activities. However, since the last update, when I tap on my journal and then tap on my activity, the app keeps on crashing. Why? Fix this and I'll up my rating."
220,Will Bourke,"April 23, 2020",1," Update - app keeps crashing when I open it. Feedback sent via app. Unreliable, doesn't connect to mi fit band daily. Have to try and force it to check, some days it won't connect at all. It missed my best day last week, v disappointed at the moment."
221,Phil J,"April 10, 2020",2, Daft change to measure steps when it's known the 10000 steps a day was a marketing gimmick. Movement minutes was much better. App should at least allow the option to choose what to use to measure. Before that change was 4 star rating.
222,Anthony F.,"April 12, 2020",1," I used the app to measure a bike ride this morning and when I was finished It said distance travel as 0.0 miles. Something wrong with this app talking to my GPS, even after giving it permission to my location data and turning on the GPS. Galaxy S9."
223,Somebody Else,"April 18, 2020",1," Changing move minutes to step counting was stupid. The point of move minutes was to help keepbyour body moving, steps only encourage people to walk or run, and it's less motivating to do workouts that don't involve a lot of steps. I'm actually mad"
224,Nathaniel Pitts,"April 17, 2020",3, Unable to adjust times of previous workouts that were started and stopped with my Wear OS watch. This is handy when I forget to stop a workout until well after I have finished. Not being able to edit is throwing off my calerie burn data considerably.
225,Gary Purdy,"April 17, 2020",1, This was a 5 star app but in the latest update you ruined it by changing the movement point system to a step counting system. Every single smart device on the planet has a step counter so why add it? I used Google Fit because of the movement point system.
226,Michael Kornrumpf,"April 18, 2020",2," Pretty cheesed off with this update. Bulk of my exercise isn't step based and, although I understand that a lot of people rely on a step count, surely the better option would be to give us a choice? Irritating."
227,T Neverwinter,"April 24, 2020",1," Worse and worse, it doesn't show you information in a useful way anymore and tries to make meaningful data out of walking around at work or the store as individual workouts.... Has nothing for swimming still. I'm looking more Nike plus from 2012 and less whatever this garbage is."
228,mattmunda,"April 26, 2020",1," Use to be able to update and track and change work outs now I can't do anything. Steps not accurately accounted for, my runs that I track with other apps that are connected to Google fit are not properly updating to Google fit. What happened!?!?"
229,Justin Renaud,"April 23, 2020",3," Worked for 4 days, now workouts aren't tracked in the ""Journal"" section, and tapping an existing workout just crashes the app. How can it be this screwed up? Edit: Thanks for reaching out, eagerly awaiting a fix."
230,molly metcalf,"April 29, 2020",2, I do not like the changes from move min to steps I wish there was the option to choose my goal. Something is also getting messed up with my linked apps.. Nike Training Club used to link directly to fit and it still does but now I'm getting 0 move min and heart points for my workout
231,Julia Farthing,"April 29, 2020",2, I really liked the app until the recent update. I much preferred tracking move minutes to steps so all activity was accumulated. Please change back to the old way of tracking or give users the option to change the method of tracking.

233,Tiffany Longcor,"April 16, 2020",1, I am so bummed I can't just track move minutes. I am a weight lifter & in a full quarantine & can't leave my house so getting steps is tough but I am still exercising and now there's no way to track it. I'm gonna have to find a different app now.
234,Stephen Murphy,"April 16, 2020",2, Tracks some bike rides but not all. And those it does track miss lots of the route. It's very annoying and surely expect better considering it's a Google application. Strava is a good alternative for cyclists until this is fixed.
235,Laura Olsen,"April 17, 2020",2," One of the main statistics is now steps. This isn't relevant to any exercise I do, so I'll be constantly ""failing"" goals, which isn't great for motivation. I'll have to look into finding a different app that's less irritating now."
236,Pamela Okerholm,"April 19, 2020",3," Move minutes was replaced by steps in the mid-April update. I don't understand why that can't be a toggle. I don't count steps, I count activity minutes. Hard to convert swimming and horseback riding to an arbitrary step count."
237,Steve Toribio,"April 28, 2020",1," With the latest update, we can no longer edit the time frames on workout entries in the journal. Sometimes I forget to stop my activity on the watch, and now I can't modify those times. Please fix!"
238,ICTman1076,"April 21, 2020",2," I'd like to be able to switch back to move minutes, please. They were a nicer way of tracking than steps. Please put it in the settings as an option. Don't remove features, just allow people to switch them off or change to a new one."
239,Conrad Siegfried,"April 25, 2020",1," We're still waiting for an option to display real measurements like distance in time and pace instead of useless hearts and steps numbers. If you don't want to ditch those fine, bit at least let us decide what we want the Journal to show us."
240,L W,"April 27, 2020",1," What happened in the last update? Now my rides aren't tracked. I can't delete fitness sessions from the journal. Come on Google, this is really poor. I thought you were were a software company. Come on and get this fixed please. It's embarrassing (for you)."
241,Nasos Loukas,"April 13, 2020",2," I added a star because of your quick response! Thanks!! The thing is that I don't want move minutes as a secondary metric, like calories, but as a primary one instead of steps otherwise, I'll never meet my goals!!"
242,Joanna Cockerill,"April 19, 2020",4, Step counter stopped working altogether on 06/04/2020. It seems to think I am completely stationery despite walking for over 1 hour every day. Was fine before that. I have had to update the times I was out via add activity. SORT IT OUT. Started working again after 1 week.
243,Wendy Harden,"April 10, 2020",1, Hate the new changes. Use to be unique but now just another step counter. There are many ways to move other than just steps. Bring back the old way or at least give me a choice of goals.
244,Roland Němec,"April 15, 2020",2, It's a great app but I really hate the new steps update... I would appreciate if there would be option to choose between steps and the old method. Until then I'll keep my review as low as 2 stars.
245,Evan Warkentin,"April 20, 2020",5," I love Google for, but with the new update, I can't see my move minutes! Please add back the option to also see your move Minutes. I relied on this app to count my activity minutes for gym class and it worked well, but now I can only see steps counted! Please. Fix this"
246,Dejan Perović,"April 17, 2020",3, I like it but it need to improve marking on the map. It marks as child to draw lines on a papper. Please the main widget make it responsible or smaller. There isn't any clear explain when I will and for what exactly I will get 1 hearth point
247,Joel Kancir,"April 16, 2020",1, The new update that changed move minutes to steps is unfortunate. I find tracking my activity in minutes is much more convenient than steps. How do I set a move minutes goal now? Really wish there would've kept an option for move minutes .
248,Jacob Cooley,"April 26, 2020",2," Love that Google offers this app, it's been crashing a lot trying to view details of my runs. Also only obese people track their workouts in steps. Please go back to the old format. Will update stars when app doesn't crash constantly"
249,Ina O,"April 29, 2020",1," I ride about 1 hour and you said I made 2 km. I used this app to check how much distance I make, now I truly think to change it on other that works properly. Instead of making irrelevant changes that don't really change anything you could add decline etc."
250,Ryan Lawler,"April 29, 2020",3," Does not track routes very accurately at all, at least when the app actually registers that I'm out on a walk or run. Otherwise, I do appreciate that the app is sleek and straightforward."
251,Allison Lloyd,"April 17, 2020",1," The switch from move minutes to step tracking makes this app pretty much useless for me, why not give people a choice between move minutes and step tracking. I swim and bike, step tracking is meaningless to me. 5 stars until the change."
252,M. M.,"April 21, 2020",1, Please bring back the active minutes tracking! Especially during quarantine some of us don't go out on long walks and we have no steps but we do other home workouts that have moving minutes. This is a bad change in a bad timing honestly!
253,Kristina Korsakaite,"April 20, 2020",2, Really frustrating... Doesn't count wright... It says i was walking for 1 and halv hour and made 2000 steps 🤷‍♀️ the other day it says I was walking on the water. Maps sometimes doesn't fit at all... Realy Google? From you I was expecting a bit more.
254,susan mcnicholl,"April 19, 2020",1, You removed move minutes... For anyone who cycles rather than walks everywhere this pretty much makes this app useless now. Did you even think about user experience. Put back the feature and allow it to be switched on or off depending on user preferences.
255,Dusty Sprinkles,"April 17, 2020",1," Now that I got the update to remove move minutes I'm also annoyed it was depreciated since playing beatsaber generates a lot of move minutes but almost no steps, though if you guys added an option to re-focus it thatd be nice if you have to be inflexible on having it as an option"
256,Laraib Javeed,"April 24, 2020",3," I can't record my sleep duration it's always says ,it should be between 1 min and 24 hours . Whenever I'm record . Like I slept at 9:00 pm and woke up at 4:30 am .But can't record it on the app."
257,Karen Boughton,"April 26, 2020",1," Suddenly since yesterday it won't work at all! I can open it but can't track any exercise, add anything and I get an error saying the app stopped. It's very frustrating!! Please fix it."
258,Justin Siems,"April 17, 2020",1," Was great until they stripped the move minutes from the daily goals. If I wanted to count steps I'd get a Fitbit. ""Steps"" is just an arbitrary feel good number that doesn't actually translate into real fitness."
259,Jillian Arrowood,"April 10, 2020",5, I would like to see options on the for breath portion of this app. Set breathing times from 2 minutes to 5 minutes ect... I would also like to see the vibration notifications to be a bit stronger. Though my main focus would be the ability to adjust breathing times.
260,Paul Swaine,"April 11, 2020",1," Change from move minutes to steps makes it impossible for me to hit any goals, my fitness app doesn't track steps so all my runs from now on will not count towards goals, please give the option back to track move minutes or steps depending on your preference"
261,Debi Skidmore,"April 19, 2020",2, I loved this app until you switched to steps. Now it is just discouraging as I am unable to walk much. It would be great if you gave folks the option of putting emphasis on steps or move minutes.
262,Tom Sweda,"April 28, 2020",4," Journal keeps causing app to crash since 4/2/20 update. Update 4/28/20: Originally, I gave the app one star; Google responded very promptly and fixed the crash bug in under 48 hrs. Impressive! Changed my rating to four stars."
263,Nicholas Ashton,"April 23, 2020",1," Worked well for months / years, quite happy with the recent updates, but used it to track a bike ride today (first time I've used it to live track) and I can't open the app since."
264,Matthew Cosenza,"April 26, 2020",4," Now that steps are able to be tracked, I find this app much more useful. Would love movement reminders based on hourly activity. with the acquisition of Fitbit it would be great for the apps to talk to each other!"
265,Leia575 Solo,"April 12, 2020",3, Please give us an option to use move minutes as our goal instead of steps. My workouts make it hard to track the number of steps I take because I cannot keep my phone on me during my karate classes. Move minutes worked better to help me track my activity.
266,Beth Striker,"April 10, 2020",2, Loved this app when I first installed it. It just recently updated and I find it worthless. I wasn't given an option not to do the update. How do I stop tracking steps and go back to tracking move minutes?
267,Steve Wood,"April 22, 2020",1, Please bring back the move minutes goal and tracker. Move minutes are much more relevant than steps to me as a desk based person. If there are competing voices then enable users to choose what they want within the app.
268,Lynn Dalsing,"April 18, 2020",2," In general I like this app and would love to give it a better rating, but changing my goals from a minutes of active time to steps when it's not always safe to leave the house seems like catastrophically stupid timing."

This bike ride was at least 8 miles round-trip. Halfway through, it said 4.28 miles and actually had a little extra track. By the time I'm back to where I started, it says 2 miles. There's some overlap on the route, bit this is so far off, it becomes worthless as a fitness tracker. You guys need to improve tracking. Location services and data are all enabled. The track on the map is mostly accurate. But the total miles are only a quarter of what I rode."
270,Randy Spear,"April 24, 2020",4," Meh... Right now the app crashes when I select an activity to view in the journal. The app is ok though normally, could be better. Need ability to share journal info and add friends/challenges like Strava. Please fix the crashing!"
271,G Marshall,"April 26, 2020",1," Terrible, just terrible. 44 min bike ride 1.28 miles, really? Ran 5k last night using it in real time tracking the run. Google fit told me I had run 5k in my ear. When I stopped and saved it I had apparently run 3.98k, then 1.28k ??! Seriously? Sort it out Google"
272,Tanya Garcia,"April 27, 2020",1, Not sure what's going on but it doesn't track anything correctly. Sometimes it will and most of the time it says I went ok a long walk and the distance doesn't match or my route. Today it tracked me driving to the store as a walk..
273,Pouya Tavassoli,"April 16, 2020",1, Every new version of Google Fit makes it worse and worse. This time it won't let you enter the app unless you choose your daily step goal. There is no skip button it forces you to enter a goal. Thats so impolite.
274,Peter Yeung,"April 25, 2020",2," On the OnePlus 7 pro this app does not work. When you get to the journal it will force stop repeatedly. Has pretty much ruined any use you can get from it, so I'm going to move to a competitor."
275,holly ebrey,"April 26, 2020",1," Was brilliant until they updated it, now I can't track my calories burnt and kms done, which was the whole point to benefit my workouts. It just crashes now! :( Downloaded a different app now, which is loads better..."
276,Anthony CZ,"April 26, 2020",4," The app keeps crashing not even letting me get into it, deleted it and reinstalled it and it did not work. After the issue was brought up by the users, it got quickly fixed up."
277,James Scholes,"April 10, 2020",2, Nooooo! Bring back Move Minutes! I cycle everywhere. Steps are meaningless to me. Please make it an option rather than forcing me to choose a number for no good reason
278,Julia Matheson,"April 19, 2020",3," Has recently moved from Move Minutes to step count as a daily goal, but doesn't count stepps as well as other apps-for example saying I have walked 7km in less than 4000 steps. Quite disappointed in the app since this change."
279,Jessica Rosa,"April 23, 2020",1, I just downloaded 5 minutes ago and when I'm trying to use it. The app closed and when I reopen it closed again.. I just want to see how I'm doing my results and workout but won't let me see just closed the app out of nowhere.
280,Mark Bronson,"April 24, 2020",4, I like the new look. I miss the messages after a workout. Since yesterday the app keeps closing on its own; won't track a workout. I had to uninstall & reinstall the app.
281,anvi sharma,"April 27, 2020",1, I walked for almost 1.5 hour but it is showing only 1.5 km what's wrong with this application I have been using google fit from last one year never faced this issue before I am totally annoyed with the application now. Will going to install this application
282,Lisa C. Phillips,"April 27, 2020",4, I loved this app until it quit tracking my workouts. The app completely closes out when I select Track Workout. I have tried uninstalling/re-installing. Would love to give 5 stars if that could be fixed.
283,Jess Hilfer,"April 9, 2020",1, i used to love this app. but more and more changes with every update taking away customizable options. Again an update taking more info away from the app. I tried to wait and am done. Only use if your some workout is walking or running.
284,Edwin Maarleveld,"April 12, 2020",2, No! Why did they change the move minutes to steps? And without the possibility to set a preference. That was so much clear to me. And different from all the other apps.
285,Becki White,"April 20, 2020",3," When tracking a walk/run, the map disappears after the walk has been marked as finished, showing only the first portion. All the other details, steps, distance, etc. remain."
286,James Page,"April 20, 2020",3, I walk around the lake but cannot understand why the map doesn't show my path correctly. It incorrectly shows my trail across the lake. I had no idea I could work on water. 🤣
287,Anil Kumar,"April 20, 2020",3," Steps tracking is ok but on new update hearts point does not starts automatically, it always start after i open the app, now also when i open app it is showing 4500 step and 0 heart points, i don't know what is the maths behind this."
288,Chris Wood,"April 19, 2020",1, Don't care about steps. I'll try reinstalling in a few months and see if they've added the ability to switch back to move minutes & heart points. I used to love this app.
289,Heather Norman,"April 21, 2020",2," I like the steps. But, it doesn't seem to track properly. I just walked 1 mile outside and it said only 267 steps. I did put the phone in the stroller. So does it not work if it's not on your body??"
290,Vajresh Patkar,"April 29, 2020",4, Google Fit is a great app and I like it very much. It can track my footsteps accurately and my sleep entries. But sleep entries of some nap which were saved gets deleted automatically. Can u please see to it that no record is lost.
291,Rishabh Khandelwal,"April 26, 2020",2," It doesn't updates the data automatically in the screen widget. I've to open the app then it updates the data. Few days earlier, it does this task excellently, but now its not doing good."
292,Maher Hussein,"April 9, 2020",3," My issue is no difference from most of the reviewers, for the last few days at the end of my workout the app showed that I burned 967 calories but later on the day it show 576 calories. I do not know why, Google could you advise please ?"
293,Fredrik Hjelmare,"April 13, 2020",1, Removing the move minutes concept and introducing steps made this app useless. It lost all competitive advantage to other apps. How am I to reach my daily goal of 5000 steps if I am cycling? Google? You're supposed to employ smart people...
294,Mikey21 Gaming,"April 10, 2020",3," I really love this app, but once in a while i look in my journal and it says that I was flossing for a fee minutes, but I wasn't, and it keeps giving me heart points and I keep having to delete it. Please fix this because it is getting annoying"

296,John Pan,"April 23, 2020",1, The latest update (04/23/2020) crashed the app each time I opened it. It is really annoying. It seems affecting both iPhone and Android phones. Did google do any test before release the update?
297,Colin Lewis,"April 27, 2020",1, Crashes when opening or trying to track workout. Terrible at tracking distance or steps. Issues were reported weeks ago and Google still hasn't updated the app. Just roll back to the prior version!
298,Joshua Behrens,"April 24, 2020",1, I cant hardly use anything in the app anymore. I cant open past exercises in Journal. I cant track a new activity. I cant add an activity. I cont do anything besides look at thr main screen. What the heck happened to this app!?!? 👎👎👎👎
299,Mike Shepherd,"April 8, 2020",2," Please bring back move minutes goal, or at least option to choose between that and steps goal. If I choose to ride to work it reduces my steps but my move minutes would be higher, now it looks like I've made no effort at all."

There is no way to easily view weekly or monthly data on total distance. In order to view total distance walked, one must click several times and view each activity in a given day.

Why is the base Wear OS system so far behind every other activity tracking watch out there? Apple Watch has it, Samsung Gear has it... hell, even Fitbit has it and they're nowhere near as big as any of these companies listed. You have virtually unlimited development resources, yet you somehow can't implement something as simple as sleep tracking... that does not give users confidence in your tools. Hopefully the app you'll inevitably develop to needlessly replace Google Fit will contain this feature."

703,Agustin Barrientos,"March 1, 2020",2," There should be a way to add stuff like body fat manually; it's crazy that we need to appeal to a third-party app to add such essential data. The UI looks nice, but it isn't very useful when trying to interpret the data."

736,Jessica Hawk Netterville,"March 11, 2020",2," This app works well sometimes, other times not so well. So frustrating! I'll have a certain amount of steps and then, it subtracts 1200 steps and keeps subtracting. 😡"

764,Vitali Tziganov,"March 5, 2020",1," Pretty useless and closed ecosystem. Very little tracking options, and only for Android Wear devices, which are a lot less functional than non Wear devices.

I use this app to track my bike rides, which don't generate steps. Although the app still tracks move minutes, the daily goal mechanic helped me stay motivated.

It auto tracked vs. me having to remember to turn it on every time I wanted to record. It wasn't as accurate as needed but this is waayyy off. I'm not getting most of my data because I have the remember to turn it on. My weight isn't automatically received from my scale. There's no place to add notes about the day/exercise, etc. There's no place to track food. In an effort to make this simple, you've made it useless. Removing and looking for something better. Update 2/17/2020: Gave it another try with a different tracker -- FitPro. A much simpler tracker and still GoogleFit can't keep up! To add injury to insult my back up plan -- syncing my phone to my medical plan's app isn't working either. My AARP health plan gives me incentives to count my steps with a tracker or my phone! The app won't sync and I have a GOOGLE phone! What on Earth??? I give up. I really wanted this to work. I believe in tracking my steps and, in spite of a physical disability, I challenge myself to walk 10,000 steps or more every day no matter what. It's very rewarding on days when I'm really struggling to ""beat"" my own record but I have to have reliable data to know I'm doing that! This is discouraging. I really thought, by now, Google would have a better handle on this. I actually thought, they might even have their own device but for them to not be able to get their own phone to sync the app correctly with medical apps and devices that are partnering with Google is shameful! Oh well. I guess I can always try the old abacus and pray I don't fall in a hole while I'm walking with my service dog down the street trying to manipulate little beads on tension rods or (even worse) lose my count and have to start all over again!

I'm using Google Fit with the new Suunto 7 Wear OS watch and the connection with Suunto Wear is not seemless (yet). Would be great if Google would share somekind of development plan for consumers to see at least what possible features are coming or at least planned (hopefully they have one). Maybe Fitbit will bring new features and possibilities when the deal is sealed.

That's what it looks like. I'm happy so far but all I've done is a couple of test sorties.

I have submitted feedback to the developers on several occasions over the last few months and have received no help and still nothing is working. I spent several hours with google support chat, after which they've said that there is nothing more they can do even though it is not working on three separate handsets. It seems to be purely a server side issue.

1523,Partha Bhattacharya,"January 6, 2020",1," Fitness is 90% dependent on diet. This app does not have any food tracking features. Without food tracking, it is useless. I love Google developers and they will do the right thing by adding these features. Come on Google. Just copy fatsecret!"
1524,jannogutierrez,"January 19, 2020",1," It was good before the update 3rd quarter of 2019. Before, if my steps weren't counted, I'd just turn off my battery saver. But now, even without battery savers, the app still wont monitor my steps. What gives?"
1525,Martin Hughes,"January 27, 2020",1," Possibly the worst app I have ever installed, I wish I could give it zero stars. I downloaded this app just for the steps. The step count freezes and even goes down during the day!!! Absolutely rubbish, will now be removing this rubbish from my phone."
1526,Aniel Reddy,"January 31, 2020",1, App hardly works even after having done enough brisk walk. I had 0 heart points and move minutes even after walking for an hour. I have tried with the recommended settings given by the developer still doesn't work at all. My entire days metrics still shows 0.
1527,Vicky Survival,"February 11, 2020",1," Never calculated my timings correctly. Sometimes I thought it is taking some time to update. But, it have never done so."
1528,S. Rucker,"March 10, 2020",1, I think it would be a wonderful ideal if you could input individual workouts and keep track with how much weight your lifting and pushups etc.
1529,Antonio Corzo,"March 11, 2020",4, It could merge with other Google/Android services and be native instead other less useful apps
1530,Rebecca Zhang,"April 6, 2020",1, Does not track steps. Totally useless
1531,Larissa Loria,"April 15, 2020",3, Need to step up the game. Should have its own sleep tracker.
1532,Mehul Dhivar,"April 17, 2020",5, Not liked latest update. Previous app was awesome.
1533,Jithin Razz,"December 7, 2019",5," I use this app only as a bridge to connect with other apps for my band. I have a MI band ,Mi fit sync it accurately, but the google fit only shows half the steps i have walked so far. So disappointed in this app. Atleast make a update to sync better with MI fit app."
1534,David David,"January 20, 2020",1, App has lost all my data apart from this month's. Doesn't seem to be anyway to get a back up of the numbers. Edit: Google reply is pretty useless. I obviously have given feedback and tried to contact them but got no reply. This reply below is worse than no reply.
1535,Chris A.,"December 13, 2019",4," App is nice and simple, but I'd like to know something: my phone has a built-in blood pressure sensor, but it seems the Google Fit app only allows to enter blood pressure figures manually and not through the sensor. Is there a way to request sensor permission, or is it a Samsung Health only feature?"
1536,Ray Goulet,"December 16, 2019",1," The fact that you can't edit time after tracking an activity makes this app terrible. Twice I forgot to stop the tracking of an activity and it ran too long, all I could was edit the name...what's the point of having an edit feature."
1537,Trey Palmer,"December 31, 2019",3," Not a bad aggregator, terrible tracker. Lately Fit had been saying I'm running much faster and further than I really am. This is pretty annoying as until recently it has been doing very well tracking my pace and distance."
1538,Bob Montgomery,"December 31, 2019",1," When it works, this app provides a good, fitness tracking experience and a well designed interface. The problem is it doesnt work half the time for whatever reason and is an awful buggy mess."
1539,Nicole Barthus,"December 19, 2019",3," Worked very well in the beginning for my fitness goals however it let me down because it hasn't been tracking my activity for a week now, it is so frustrating that there are very few app that really keep up with demands these days 😔"
1540,Tom Plumptre,"January 14, 2020",3," The app is quite nice in general but it says I have burned 1700 for the day, with a breakdown of calories burned on specific walks. I did 5k steps, which is about 200 calories. Doesn't seem to explain where rest comes from."
1541,Edward Bartko,"January 21, 2020",1, Does not work keep getting error message unable to verify your account 2/2 tried your workarounds - they don't work. Been on a few sites on the web looks like this issue has been around for a while. You need to fix this
1542,Brian LoBue,"January 26, 2020",3," Good for simple tracking, and my data from other exercise apps syncs to it so I can see everything in one place. However, it absolutely needs to integrate sharing/social for positive reinforcement. This is a bug."
1543,Rushabh Shah,"February 5, 2020",1, The app doesn't track steps at all. I checked all my tracking settings and they are correct. Yet the app doesn't track my steps.. kindly help @google fit..
1544,keri ivan,"February 17, 2020",3," After updating ,the app no longer reads my move and heart minutes but reads the calories. All was great before updating. Please fix it."

1547,Rachel Donaldson,"April 17, 2020",1, After running for 10 minutes it still said id gone 0.00km
1548,Martin Kettling,"January 8, 2020",1, It is insane that I don't have access to download the data of this app. Some of the most personal information possible and there's only an option to delete. Absolutely needs to be corrected. Makes me very fearful of going further into the Google Ecosystem.
1549,silvio napoli,"February 15, 2020",4," very good app. an idea to add to it could be to choose a diagram over another so that we can compare ,( for example,) hearts beats with elevation."
1550,Kaddie Eilish,"February 26, 2020",3, I always loved the app but now the last few days it just stopped counting my steps and everything else!!!

1552,Matthew Meyer,"November 25, 2019",1," Remember when google was cool and made great software? No you're probably too young... My data doesn't load, screen just pulses lightly with zeros for all values. Also widget on phone screen is just a blank space and tapping it does not load the app."
1553,Ajay Kolte,"December 28, 2019",3," Step counting is not accurate. I am walking same route every day but on each day it shows different distance, different steps and different heart points. I understand steps can vary but distance should be accurate . Observed error is 15 to 20%."
1554,Alex Teer,"January 2, 2020",5," Great app. Most of the bad reviews come from people who don't understand what basal metabolic rate is. They think the app is failing to track calories, but really it's that person failing to."
1555,Ro I,"January 23, 2020",1," The app was not syncing with my Fitness tracker/watch. Instead it kept counting steps by itself. I don't want this app to count steps or track anything, I only it want it to sync in data from my tracker which is already connected to Google Fit."
1556,Asha Spicer,"January 26, 2020",3," This app now works only with wifi. I am poor and LOVED this app until it became wifi only. It won't let me save activities without wifi. I'm disabled, and this WAS a great way to keep me moving. but theres little point if I cant add activities."
1557,William Bailor,"January 31, 2020",1," App doesn't let you edit your tracks, makes it pretty much worthless if you're trying to keep track of distance and your phone GPS has low accuracy. Deleting this app and will not recommend it to anyone."
1558,Claire Cosgrove,"February 4, 2020",1," No longer working. Stopped updating, tracking, tried to reinstall and now i cant even get back in. Very angry and disappointed. Lost all my information now."
1559,Joe / Entertaining Events,"February 19, 2020",1, It doesn't count the steps all the time which is annoying because I miss out on Qantas points as the Qantas app syncs to this one.
1560,Miki Masuda,"January 6, 2020",1, Update: Went on a 16 mile bike ride. Nothing in Google Fit. Do I need to turn it on every time? How do I select specific activities? Still decreases all stats in the evening when I'm encouraged by the day. So frustrating 😡.
1561,Josive Tang,"January 29, 2020",1," Google Fit doesn't record my steps accurately. My 3 other trackers & fitness apps such as Samsung Health show more than 20K steps yet Google Fit shows only 8K steps! And Google Fit even deduct steps every 5 mins, from 8187 to 8056 to 7198 etc. Does this make sense?!"
1562,Jennifer Mahen,"November 28, 2019",2," App used to work great but now it just stops working all together. I have tried all of the troubleshooting, but nothing seems to keep it working now. It was great when it worked!"
1563,Baqoyev Og'abek,"December 25, 2019",1," This app doesn't track your activity correctly, I have used it for a while and I noticed a few bugs. I use LG health app and it is way better than this. I think Google should take an example."
1564,Kholio Man,"December 26, 2019",1," It does not work anymore. I have reinstalled tha app and it still cannot verify my google account to log in. Its says always: ""Oops something went wrong"". It's a shame that a product from Google is so poorly programmed."
1565,Victoria,"December 29, 2019",1," App was pretty correct on measuring steps, bicycle rides and jogging. After my phone got updated it's OS to Android 9.1, app doesn't count at all. Fix it with update or something, please. After I 'll give another rating on the app."
1566,Thomas Dornsife,"December 31, 2019",3, I use this app with my phone and my Wear OS and it works OK. Tracking steps isn't always accurate. The widgets do not work anymore for the past few updates. Didn't expect this from Google.
1567,Kayla Schumacher,"January 9, 2020",1," Google Fit has not been recording my steps at all for the last few weeks. Unsure as to why this is happening. App is up to date, my calories burned have been counted but my steps have not."
1568,Santosh Sharma,"February 19, 2020",3," Since 11-02-2020 this app has stopped tracking all the activities. Tried to re-loggin into my account, but even that's not possible. Please advise"
1569,Manu Fernandez,"February 27, 2020",1, Since last week the app stopped syncing with other services (like Health from Huawei's smart watch & Garmin/Strava). It really sucks.
1570,rebecca philip,"February 24, 2020",3, Every now and then the app stops counting my steps.. And it gets fixed only if I uninstall and install it again. Quite annoying actually
1571,Aparna Chandrasekar,"March 3, 2020",3, Swimming not compatible with fossil sport watch
1572,Cω Tham,"November 25, 2019",3," As much as I hated this app, as I loved it (more love than hate, fortunately), why is your swim tracking only available on phone, but NOT on the watch? Do I stuck the phone on my wrist when I go swimming? *facepalm*"
1573,Graham Lucas,"December 5, 2019",1, What has happened? Seeing lots of similar feedback but the app randomly stopped recording activities a few weeks ago and now cant even login have tried everything to fix and have left feedback via suggested ways please give us an update on a fix for this
1574,Dipendra Chand,"December 11, 2019",3, Earlier I've used Samsung Health. That was pretty much accurate than this one. This app does not counts every step as you take. But I'm positive that google will work further to make it the best health app.
1575,Vishal Maharishi,"December 18, 2019",3, In this app everything is good but it not provide most useful information about health like steps calories distance on notification bar😔😔.This is the most important feature for these type of applications. so please fix this issue as soon as possible.
1576,Danny Mitchell,"January 2, 2020",1, Does not record half of the distance walked... Talked to support and they said turn on walking tracker...works about 30 percent of the time. I have other apps that use this app for distance walked...not happy but what can you do?
1577,Sebastian,"January 6, 2020",1," Doesn't always track steps, sometimes there's a lag. Also, you can punch in two workouts and then later on in the day one disappears from your journal. This is a poor app."
1578,Prateek Agarwal,"January 16, 2020",1," The app data doesn't remain consistent the next day. Suppose today i score 25 heart points, it will now show somehow much less tomorrow say 5 heart points. The same case is with Move minutes. How it is showing less for the previous days?"
1579,Krishna Agarwal,"January 21, 2020",5, Hello there! Loved the app! Is there any way we can get day/week/month data on the basis of distance covered as well? Currently we are getting it on move minutes and heart points as per American standards
1580,sairam kambhampati,"February 26, 2020",1, From past 2 days The app is not calculating the steps its just calculating calories and kilometers even after giving all the permissions and given 2 to 3 times feedback in the app itself but no response
1581,David Baglietto,"February 26, 2020",3, Good app but missing so much. Should be options to add additional heath bits. Such as - Temperature - Sugar Levels - Oxygen levels
1582,Mik Scheper,"February 27, 2020",2," The phone app is fiddly and annoying to use—way too many user steps for entering activity. Since Google killed the web app, I'm abandoning Google Fit."
1583,Vinay Gupta,"April 16, 2020",4, This app keeps me updated about how many calories i have burned in a day. It motivates me to achieve my daily workout targets.
1584,William Martin,"April 22, 2020",1, It's a good idea but the app is so dysfunctional.
1585,Chhatrasal Kurrey,"November 27, 2019",1," 1,Why can't you give metrics for km or miles ? 2.why can't you add all distance time calories and heart points in 1 metrics ? 3.why you have not added a way to track a weeks all data in one place using rows or list for each day..?

1586,Farah Daou,"December 7, 2019",3," Th App is still missing major features, such as tracking other lifestyle habits and providing coaching (activity, meditation, etc.). It would also be helpful if weekly reports are provided with summaries at least."
1587,Indian Cycling Network,"January 6, 2020",2, It should be able to connect with smart watches and heart rate sensors. And sync with Garmin apps. Garmin tracks all the data automatically while Google fit ask to enter manually. Fit connected with Strava app but not with Garmin.
1588,Raegan Jones,"December 25, 2019",4, I would give this a five-star but it does not track dancing very well. It is great for knowing how much you've walked or ran but when it comes to dancing it doesn't really track what you've done.
1589,Virangulaa,"January 12, 2020",5, This is a very accurate and precise app. However I am facing this battery drain issue after I installed this app. But I'm not sure what the exact problem is. Need a solution team. Please help.
1590,Stephen Michielsen,"January 13, 2020",2," It used to work well, but recently, it has started to subtract heart points instead of adding them. Came to work with 14 heart points, went for a walk, now it says 6. Not acceptable."
1591,Donato Di Paolo,"January 16, 2020",2, Very poor app. It doesn't sync with my Iphone (IOS) so I get two different sets of data depending on which one I am carrying. Moreover the stats available are very poor compared for example with Apple Health.
1592,Liv C,"February 17, 2020",1," Awful app. Most of the time it doesnt count my steps or sync, which then causes issues with pokemongo."
1593,Jerry M,"February 10, 2020",1, Terrible app. Doesn't count most of the steps. Please make something as good as Apple's Health app which is way more stable.
1594,Jenna Zaeske,"December 9, 2019",1," I stopped using this app when I could no longer track my goals. I would have ""run 3 times a week"" or bike, yoga, etc. When I could no longer make goals and track them, is where this app went wrong."
1595,shafeeunnasar am,"December 15, 2019",1," It was all working fine until 3 days back.it stopped counting steps initially .so I logged out and cleared data and now i cant go past the login page. It says ""can't verify. Check internet connection"" ."
1596,BEN,"December 29, 2019",4," Don't use this app much, but would want to be able to link to more other services and devices (trackers). One app in specific would be Garmin Connect and maybe even Samsung Health Apart from that It's fine."
1597,kishore Seetharaman,"December 21, 2019",1, This app suddenly stops works and now i am not able to login itself after i tried to reinstal the app. Very disappointed . Didn't expect this from Google and it is happening for the most of the users on this month..
1598,Jack Roberts,"December 30, 2019",3, I am struggling to understand why the app doesn't possess the ability to track sleep without the need for a 3rd party app. I recently purchased a wearOS watch to replace my Fitbit and now if I want to track sleep I will have to faff around linking more apps together
1599,Kristina Hinojosa,"January 26, 2020",3," It's recently stopped logging movement independently, and also not syncing movement from linked apps inside the journal tab. Selecting the day, occasionally it will appear.. but not always. Hope this bug can be resolve soon."
1600,Junior Lopez,"April 18, 2020",4, I feel it should connect with fitbits and watches
1601,Sreemoyee Tagore,"December 17, 2019",2, The app started out fine but now it has stopped tracking move minutes/steps/heart minutes. I have seen this with several users. All settings are correct. Google needs to fix this asap.
1602,adamgroo,"December 22, 2019",2," I really liked Google Fit for the three months I've been using it....until 2 days ago when it simply stopped working. Cannot get it to track anything now. Very disappointing, because it was very useful and helpful."
1603,R.A. Steele,"December 30, 2019",3," Google FIt is adequate. It tracks data. It isn't intuitive or user friendly, but it does track data and provide positive feedback. It would get a fourth star if it simply worked with Fitbit."
1604,Dan Abramsky,"December 30, 2019",1," Heart Points malfunctions frequently; does not track properly. Makes me distrust all the other settings. There's no customer support contact or chat available either. Sloppy. Get in the game, Google..."

1606,James Hulstedt,"January 16, 2020",3, Needs work. Poor location tracking. The maps it collects are inaccurate and missing points along the route. It's goal oriented which is annoying. Wants to set goals and change them etc.
1607,Lucy D,"January 18, 2020",1, Was fine until the 4th October last year which was the last time it tracked my steps or any runs/ walks I have been on. I used the help option and checked the permissions and they were all switched on. Still doesn't work.
1608,DEEPAK Kumar S,"February 17, 2020",5," It is a source of motivation to walk and count steps, initially I counted heart minutes and total minutes now I target 10000 steps. Lovely application by Google team, thank you"

1614,munib ur rehman,"December 29, 2019",1, Needs alot of changes. For e.g Your workout Result isn't That supportive as we can't see maximum speed and others. It isn't on the level of Samsung health but as A Google app I am blackmailed by myself to use it but I still hate it
1615,Gowtham Krishna,"January 26, 2020",5," This app doesn't always sync with the connected apps like Mi fit . When it does, it doesn't completely. It syncs the sleep data, not the run or walk data.it doesn't sync the heart data often. Please fix immediately"
1616,Simon McNamara,"February 7, 2020",3, Good for consolidating days from multiple apps. Would be better if it directly supported Bluetooth heartrate monitor.

1620,Omar Abdallah,"December 10, 2019",1," App stopped tracking steps as of Sunday. App won't connect and just continues to say 'oops, something went wrong' as it seems there is an issue with the server- so I cannot send feedback via the app"

1623,Kirit Joshi,"December 3, 2019",3," It doesn't calculate the distance correctly. However, it follows on the map accurately. Today for 9000 something steps, it calculated my distance 9km meaning my one step is app 1meter. Strange and definitely inaccurate."
1624,Irene Gutleber,"December 11, 2019",1, Worked well until all the sudden it stopped tracking my steps. Very frustrating since I get reimbursed for meeting step goals. The app help section was not helpful for fixing the problem.
1625,Brodie Leaumont,"December 20, 2019",1," Can you actually fix this issue Google? Stop telling people to submit feedback and just fix the damn app. It no longer tracks and after attempting to reinstall the app, it can no longer ""verify your account""."

1630,Jill Rule,"February 17, 2020",1, My comment is that it is nearly 100% inaccurate. I walked a measured 2 mile route and it miscounted steps and miscalculated at 1.4 miles. I do 2000 steps to a mile but it only counted 2700 for 2 miles.
1631,Annaraja Duraiswamy,"February 24, 2020",5, Not working on Samsung M30s.. Please help It's not counting steps correctly and Heart points are not even started.. 24/2/2020 - It started working.. Thanks... 5 stars

1638,Bert Sehling,"January 14, 2020",2," App has stopped tracking steps since most recent update to phone OS. Phone is a note 10+. It still seems to track my calories burned, but not steps/distance, which is also affecting my egg hatching in pokemon go."
1639,Terri Smith-Wright,"January 13, 2020",1, Incredibly inaccurate! Hugely overstates both distance and calories burned and does so consistently. Waste of storage space on your phone. Don't bother with it.
1640,Bartek NITKA,"January 17, 2020",1," Another update #madebygoogle, another app with broken functionality. No updates of progress during the day, message ""oops, something went wrong"" is the main message in the app. Eternal beta galore."

1642,Jim White,"January 27, 2020",5, Good features and function. Has a tendency to die and have a hard time restarting. I've had to disconnect and go back to factory settings a few times.
1643,Michael Koehle,"February 2, 2020",2, Missing features like month's averaged scores. Useful info like steps per day over time is buried.
1644,Devin Burns,"February 8, 2020",1, The app logged me out and won't log back in. It says I don't have internet connection even though I do. Very frustrating 😠

CPTs would love that, too, even if they're not training at this time. [¶] Right now, this app serves a very limited function and puts it in line with most other useless fitness apps. Maybe that's Google's goal, a la Apple. [¶] Google Keep could easily meet the desired functionality if it were modified. Currently, Keep is not user friendly due to its list spacing and check mark boxes, which are far too small, and because those tiny check mark boxes are on the left side of their respective item descriptions.

Yesterday my heart points went to 13, 16, 22 and 37. I was happy. I opened that app later and saw that 37 refresh to 0. Checking yesterday's total today, it's 20. Treating fitness as a game with points is powerful, but if you can lose points for no apparent reason it is very disappointing. I always earn at least some heart points daily, but I frequently have days without points because they just disappear."

It was reliable, easy to figure out, and tracked information I was interested in, such as changes of elevation on my walks.  Also looked nice.  The new version stinks.  It frequently won't start at all, it doesn't track my route consistently - sometimes the route it tracks looks like the GPS system is wobbling!  And sometimes it won't find me at all, though I'm starting from the same place every single day.  Lots of problems, including that it put my photo on the start page, which is NOT something I want and can't get rid of.  I don't like that kind of invasiveness.  PLEASE bring back the old Fit for those of us unhappy with the new one!  There is not one feature of the new that I want, and I do want features of the old one back.  Guess I have to ""edit"" this review rather than write a new one.  I've uninstalled Google Fit because it's not fit to be on my phone.  The latest problems include draining my battery by continuing to run in the background after I've turned it off, and NOT running to track my activity when I tell it to.  Since you can't be bothered to provide the option of the old system, it's history."

Google Fit makes changes to the API so frequently it was almost not worth the grief of having no synchronization while other apps adjusted.

I was really close to the big new year's milestone of heart points. I saw a notification on my app this morning on my Google Pixel 3XL and I checked it.

I restarted my phone, which I've had for a week now, and thought that would help.  Now it says I have only 58 heart points and there is no prior step counts, no weight logged - nothing else.    It's been glitchy before and not logged some activity and other issues, on my old Motorola phone, but this is really awful.  I know it's not really related to the type of phone I have but still - it's a GOOGLE Pixel 3XL.    I'm kind of crushed.

The app has gone out of grid for a complete week without any sync. Had to open the app someday to start it. Hate the new interface, maybe we are used to the old one. I like the way how things were arranged in the old version, the information flow was intuitive and sensible. It was a like a puppy that follows us day in and day out. I'm utterly disappointed with the interface, and was at first puzzled, if this was the correct FIT app.   I know our remarks may not be as helpful, because, we may not see what you were trying to bring up.   The heart points and things like that are a good gamification effort, but i suspect, if that is serving the purpose.   Hope you'd take some of these reviews and include us in the beta testing phase. :)"

Adding as well a workout or program to help you meet those goals. I loved Samsung Health because it had running programs to build towards running marathons. And I could track my fitness with others on my age group. Sadly, this app has none of that this far. It merely tracks your steps. For the most part that's the only thing it's good at."

It doesn't accurately measure steps anymore and always seems to be subtracting them and it hasn't imported my Withings scale data since Sept 17th. I haven't seen Sleep As Android sync correctly with this new version. The journal also doesn't match the data on the home dashboard, so that's totally not confusing. 🙄 It's difficult to navigate if you're used to detailed information like the previous app version had, lord help me if I ever need to edit an automatically tracked activity in here from like bike to walk, it seems like it's going to be a giant headache. Finally, the heart points are stupid. This new paradigm is vague and confusing and maybe if it was used anywhere else it would be helpful but right now it feels like you earn these mysterious points for doing who knows what, and that's if the app even tracks it correctly. Then it chastises you for not meeting this goal of weird points and makes you lower it so you can feel extra bad about yourself. What would have been helpful are notifications that tell you when you've been sitting too long or haven't walked enough. Or maybe like meditation or breathing exercises. But as it is right now, it looks pretty but it's a giant pain in the butt."

I only wish you could zoom in and out on the map while you were walking. I go on a lot of unmarked forest trails and I use these fitness trackers to stop me getting lost and to work out the best route back to the car. It's harder to do that when the app gives you a fixed distance that only shows a frustratingly limited view of your surroundings. If they implemented some sort of pan and zoom I'd probably give this four or five stars, if they keep it as it is I'll probably have to switch back to mapmywalk.

It's not intuitive really in the least. I had to dig for the settings menu, it set goals for me automatically that probably will be perfectly useless for me. I love Walking but I'm not going to go just because some app tells me too. Sorry. Also it snows 9 months out of the year where I am so I can't possibly walk every day because it simply isn't safe sometimes to walk in blizzards and 4 + feet of snow. I will give this app one month after I can connect it with go. If my impressions haven't improved by then and/or I find it useless in some way it's going bye bye again. Just so you know I love walking and use a simple app called pedometer pretty regularly. It's a wonderful app that tracks steps taken, distance walked, and calories burned among other things pretty accurately. It isn't very robust but it does exactly what I want and need it to and it does it well. Only downside is I have to turn it on and leave it active for about 5 mins for it to be accurate but it's easy on my phone for battery and processor so with Pokemon go it's amazing even if I can't sync the two.

When this happens I've tried force-closing the app and even cycling power on my device.  But I've found that the only way to wake it up is to go home and turn wifi on.

I can see what they were trying to do - simplify to make things easy and focus on the basics. These are: walk for 60 minutes a day and move briskly for 30 minutes. It also has a step counter and a tracker to see how many times a week you have run. But that's it. That's literally it. There is No tracking of the run, you can't review previous days unless input by a fitbit/misfit/other tracker, you can't track other activities like cycling etc, it doesn't tell you how many calories you burned with your exercise or what time you did them unless your fitbit tells it, and when that happens it doesn't total the calories when you review them. It also doesn't count your brisk minutes as one block. It could literally be two minute intervals throughout the day which add up to thirty minutes and you have no idea when these were done. You can't review total calorie use during day, and can't input calories consumed. There are no training programmes or anything like you would expect from a fitness app. In addition the design is just plain awful and boring. Nothing motivational here at all. It's just way too simplistic to call itself Google Fit. This should be called Google WHO Low Tech Step Counter, because that's what it is.

The app will tell you how many miles you've gone, number of steps, and estimated calories burned, BUT ONLY on that day (ie at midnight, you can no longer see this info!). After the day is over, you can only see the ""heart points"" and ""movement-""whatevers you have done, and these two ""measurements"" are the only things you can set goals toward. While the idea behind these is okay, I still want a solid number that makes sense to compare and work toward, and it feels unfair to track the info that most fitness apps would track and then hide it/remove it/withhold it. It's nice, I suppose, to get more points for running than walking, and is a different metric than just steps, but the exact ""how"" this works is kindof a mystery. Literally: 1 point for every 30 steps/minute and ""more"" (two?) for ""more effort"". LOTS OF AIR QUOTES! Lots of made up metrics that may or may not make sense for you. As someone who walks a lot as part of my job and to commute, I just want to compare day to day to track what I've done. It doesn't work for me. If you need a reminder to get up and move, this app has nice notifications and a cute graph that i guess you could motivate yourself to do, knowing a run will get the goal met faster than walking, which might be motivating. It will also attempt to split off your runs/walks and show a quick map. So you can see at a glance how long that walk was in the AM vs PM. Of course, this gets truncated/partially deleted after the day is done. It attempts to split my day up into about a dozen separate ""walks"" and appeared to only save (the longest? The most point-making? Again, who knows!) three after the day was over."

Now it's so minimalistic as to be useless, with only two goals to set (time active and ""heart points"") and very poor tracking. The old app even had handy widgets you could place on your home screen to keep track of your goals and activity. This update removed them completely and replaced them with...nothing! I want the old app back. It had more features and, despite that, was more user friendly than this minimalist garbage.

I hate that it is incredibly inaccurate. It constantly drops steps; you open the app, it shows a step count, then updates and lowers that count - by hundreds of steps, sometimes over a thousand. I have a smartwatch, and the numbers on the watch's fit app never seem to match the app on my phone; and when they do sync, the app defaults to the lower number of steps (apparently). I've watched my step count drop on phone and watch over and over. It does not sync well with other fitness apps; they overwrite the Google fit data. If I track a bike ride on fit, and another app also picks up the activity, but doesn't track correctly (because I didn't set that app to track), the Google fit data is overwritten by the other app - which only picks up about a third of my ride. It they could fix these issues, it would be the best fitness app I've used, but at this point it's so unreliable that I need redundant apps in order to get anything close to accurate info."

However, this concept does not work when move minutes and heart points aren't counted from aggregated activities from 3rd party apps.

Being able to connect related apps is a great feature because I can see all my workouts in one place still without having to manually do it all the time, but it doesn't get the details right. For example, if I go for a 1.5 mile run through my Nike Run app, it'll show up on Google as a 1.3 miles and the time/pace will be wrong because of it but with the way the Google app is now, you can't edit that information. Also, when I delete the workout, and try to add the activity to put in the correct details, the heart points/move minutes don't adjust and I hate that I can't put in the ""seconds"" as the smallest time measurement because improving and tracking my times are super important.

I moved last year, and was pleased to see it could ALSO show you elevation changes, so I could see how many hills I was going up or down, and at what points.  THEN... it got a big update and redesign.  Now, there are no maps, and half the features are gone.  If they've been hidden behind a DLC paywall, then I consider it a mild bait and switch, and would rather find another app that is up-front about it.  So, I give it 2 stars, because it USED to be good."

This has happened on more than one occasion and I am left with inaccurate information about my workout. If possible I suggest implementing an option to have the without automatically stop or manually stop.

Apparently this morning I cycled 7 km at a pace of 60 km/hr. But hey I got ""6 heart points"" for it, so who cares...🤔"

If you simply want to track basic metrics such as steps taken and distance walked/cycled per day/activity, along with a GPS based map of the route traveled, do not use Google Fit.  Some details are in the Journal, but they are buried instead of right there in your main view.  The interface looks pretty; but the gamification is complete and utter nonsense, merely dumbing down the app to the lowest common denominator.  Want to count daily steps?  Nope!  Congratulations on some completely meaningless ""Heart Points"", though!  Want to see a map of your route? Sure, but points along the route can be off by a kilometer, or more, a level of accuracy that's good enough for some I guess.  How about that 10km bike ride home, where you stopped at the grocery store en route?  Well, you were /clearly/ walking, despite large sections of the route being at 25-30km/h, a new World Record!  //facepalm//  Please, add back the basic features of the old Google Fit app, or simply release a Google Fit Classic, for those of us who have no need for these recent changes."

At one time, it was possible to set goals to 10 minutes, which was not ideal, but workable. Now, it is not possible to set these goals at all.

I'm using the app with a Mi Band, whose app would seem to be sending bad data, or data that's interpreted by Fit incorrectly. But there's absolutely no way to remove these bad tracks.  When I try to use Takeout to examine the exercise tracks, it tells me there's been an error but nowhere does Fit tell me what the problem with its own data is.  There's no lockscreen indication of currently activity tracking.  More often than not, there's be a status bar notification of an activity being tracked but there's nothing apparent in the journal as being recorded. One has to access the active tracking by selecting the status notification.  And the only way to send feedback is from the profile screen, so one can't offer to send a screenshot of the dodgy data on the journal screen that's causing a problem.... So yeah, all up looks great and feels like with some simple polish it could be great for casual use.

This review is for the new version of Fit that came out in fall 2018, in conjunction with the big update to WearOS. I tried using it with my Nexus 6P for simple tracking of the distance and time of my running routes. For this most basic use case, it just doesn't work, which is inexcusable. Hence the 1-star review.  2 critical pieces of functionality are ridiculously broken. First, when you're doing the activity (running, in my case) it usually computes your pace wrong. Sometimes it seems to include the time when you had paused the app (so the pace shows as way too slow), other times it seems to badly overestimate the distance (so the pace is way too fast). Second, even when the measurement is paused, it counts any distance that you move during the pause as part of the route. So what is the pause feature for?!?  The old version of Fit had a bad UI that encouraged user mistakes around pausing/restart, but besides that it worked at least for basic time+distance measurement. Now it can't do even that.  Other important things are broken as well, if contacted I'll be happy to explain them to a Google QA engineer."

The only reason this app used to stand out above others was because of the projected calorie burn and the calorie goal progress widget that used this projected measure. No other fitness app does a projection of calories burned by the end of the day so that one can get a sense of how on track one is to reach one's goal. But they went and ruined it by taking away the widget, and now as of the past week, by messing up calorie burn estimates completely. It looks like resting calorie burned is not taken into account at all, so that it's impossible for me to reach 2000 calories even at the same or greater activity level as before. I've submitted many, many feedback comments within the app and have never heard from them. Is anyone even listening?

I think the main thing I like about it is that it automatically tracks steps.  Additionally, I have mine linked to my Walgreens account & get Walgreens rewards after so many points, & as stated earlier, even if I don't specifically exercise, such as using elliptical, it still tracks steps automatically & those go towards points for Walgreens rewards.  I like that I can track my weight, blood pressure, activities, etc.  I took off one star because up until recently I never had a problem with it not tracking my steps.Then it seemed to just quit working as far as the steps go.I sent feedback on 2 separate occasions regarding this. After the 1st time I sent feedback, some time later it started working again then quit (By the way, I checked to make sure my 'Track activity metrics' in the Settings was on & it was).    Through trial & error, I have discovered that if I turn the Track activity metrics off, & then on again, it starts working after that.I don't know if it gets messed up maybe after having to turn my phone off to charge it, but I will try to notice if I can figure out when it stops working.I am happy I figured out a solution, but it's still kind of a pain."

Because of this distance is also inaccurate. Doesn't seem to track distance for elliptical or steps & distance for stationery biking even though both have enough movement for the accelerometer to detect. If you want to edit a wrong work out then the latest version limits what you can edit which is kinda stupid. Like the convenience but the accuracy has to really improve.

At first, the journal entry on the elliptical entry says I burned 340 calories.  A few hours later, it's only 54 calories.  My watch is recording my heartbeat the whole time.    I don't understand the algorithm the program is using to calculate calories burned.  Why would it initially say 340 then switch to 54?  Why is this problem intermittent?  Calories burned are passed to my nutrition app LoseIt! so I'd like them to be as close to accurate as possible (and 54 after 30 minutes on a machine isn't accurate).

Unfortunately, it keeps getting screwy with weight tracking. It's pulling it from everywhere, with multiple logs from each app. The biggest issue is the sync with Female Fitness - they make a weight mandatory, and put in a BS one that you can't zero out (already contacted them).

Now it shows about 2100 steps on my Pixel 3XL.  To confirm, I did the following:  I used my son's Pixel 2 in the other pocket.  It counted 3250.  I used my wife's iPhone.  I counted 3400.  I used my old Nexus 5x phone.  It counted 3250.  I tried the Pixel 3XL replacement phone, it counted the same as my Pixel 3XL. So I returned the replacement phone.  I did all fixes suggested by Google tech support - went back to factory specs. - Nothing.  Changed battery settings Optimize off . - Nothing  I think the problem is the phone Pixel 3XL or the operating system, more than the app."

I walk the same route 3 to 5 days a week and it's being recorded differently every day. According to the route tracker, it looks like I've zigged and zagged all over the place instead of walking in a straight line and it seems to have added 1/4 to 1/2 a mile to my total for that work out.I still use the app to record heart bpm and move minutes but I'm not so sure about the heart points anymore.

I can not edit or delete activities that are incorrect and it didn't add activities I recorded manually through the browser version because it didn't sync no matter what I did. Going back to using the web browser version even though it will mean losing automatically tracked walks.

It is far from being a complete or even a good fitness/health app. The app should learn and allow the user to teach it about its kinetics, so the app can recognize when the user is walking, running, bicycling or just shaking its legs. Should also be able to natively record sleep, nutrition, body measurements, heart rate, blood oxygen, blood pressure, exercises and more in a complete way (not only basic info, let the user decide if it wants a basic and simple experience or a complete one), analyzing these informations and creating complete graphics and charts, giving not only individual informations about each activity but also crossing/comparing it with each other. Could also have a medical tab, where the user can log its conditions, medicines, medical tests results and so on. Google has the money and the means to do that, it only lacks some motivation and initiative. Untill then it will stay lagging behind competition - Apple Health, Samsung S Health, Strava, Sleep as Android, cronometer (CRON-O-Meter), Body Measurement (by Cook Applications), Sony Lifelog - these are only a few examples of apps that perform (way) better than Google in one or more of the cited fields."

A very disappointing anomaly I am experiencing is the total omission of distance tracking when I cycle commute(Everyday) from home to work. I'm glad that it still auto recognizes that I am cycling, but just tracking the time and not tracking my distance is a big disappointment from previous iterations. I thought Google being so good with machine learning and AI would make recognizing and tracking my EASY daily commute a breeze.    Through the Google Fit website I was able to view the Google Fit data within a bigger screen. Which in turn made it easier for me to have other apps open on the side, to plan my next routes, or to see my progress. Omitting it was a very abrupt decision.

I have been sending Google sometimes daily reports for the past few weeks with my contact details and I've received no reply - nothing. Radio silence. The Google Fit app is the step recording device that sits behind my Qantas Wellbeing app - I earn points for my steps - or I was until recently. Because Google Fit is massively under-recording my steps for the last several weeks,  I'm not receiving my points count with Qantas. The problem with Google is the organisation is so large that it's unaccountable and has no customer assurance or follow up. Qantas advised that Google Fit recently changed the algorithm that it uses and that other customers are complaining that their steps are not recording as promised. Please Google, if you offer a service be accountable to your customers. The Samsung Health app is working and accurate. Sadly, Qantas uses Google Fit as its step recording app. Qantas, please offer your customers the choice to use Samsung and other apps."

I like the idea, genuinely, however it falls short on expectations.   Fit and Maps do not integrate with one another, any tracking data recorded using Fit has no method to be viewed within maps, so if you leave your phone at home or turned off using only a Wear OS device, then only Fit will keep the log data but will not share it with Maps, Maps will then only log the last points your cell phone was turned on.  So if, like me you wish to view your Fit timeline, possibly retracing routes taken, sadly for now your stuck using a small, unscale-able image within the Fit app unable to zoom in to any specific points.  It would be nice if a full integration into the Maps timeline was possible, where hovering your mouse over a specific point of your route/run/cycle path was possible with a floating balloon overlay including your heartrate and speed at the specific point your hovering over.   I hope someone realizes that the lack of web-pc based Fit access is missing instead of just offering some half assed attempt at an app!  Com-on Google, please sort it out."

I work 10 hour days on my feet (very physically active job) with only 20 minutes where I'm sitting in one place for lunch. When the counter works correctly it says I'm at about 14000 steps.

I go for a walk every morning , usually over an hour, but the timing either.guesses or is way below for example it said i was 13mins, when i was about an hour.so idrk"

I stand at the start line and want it to start when I hear the start gun. This is nowhere near a serious app. I am a runner so on the main screen during a race I want to see 3 basic things. 1 how long i have been running (race time so far)  2 the distance i have run so far and 3 my current speed/pace. Yes these values are all available but on different screens. Lapsed time is always on display but my speed is on the page with calories. distance with heart rate. So to tell how i am doing in a race and whether i need to speed up i need to flick through 3 screens. I am often exhausted and don't have time to flick through screens so need basic things available. Google make the screens customisation so we can choose what is important to us and what to see on the main screen. Google go and buy a Garmin and find one of your team who is a runner and send them out for a run with both to see how a proper running app should look. Just one more thing. When i look back at run history it shows pace and not the option to show speed. Some runners work with speed not pace

Apparently i was active 155 minutes today, while literally at my desk all day except a few mins here and there. My detailed activity list doesn't add up anywhere close to 155 mins. The same problem with the ""number of steps"". No i didn't do 12K steps today but thanks for trying to make me feel better about myself. It's frustrating to not know how these magic incorrect numbers are calculated. Uninstalling."

3621,john darby,"September 20, 2018",2," The prior version had an easy way to track cumulative data (all types of activities or individual types of activity) over a daily, weekly or monthly basis. This allowed users to compare data of their choosing in a more comprehensive way. The current app is far insuperior now."
