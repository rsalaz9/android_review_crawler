Why couldn't they just have this option available in Google Drive, I donot 
understand why some features that could be in one app are separated to 
making a new one, not a bad thing, the newer phones can handle it, they 
have more memory so that wouldn't be a problem. This technology is amazing, 
I definitely will think this will make it great for online gaming, so we 
could store our older video games, and also for saving cryptocoin wallets, 
so the cryptowallets can be link to the cloud."

SSH works well and you can monitor CPU usage and other basic stats fine, but many other features are missing, such as networking. I would also like to view logs away from home to investigate a bug, but it takes 30 seconds to load the logs and searching doesn't work at all.

Customizing home cards yourself is quite compelling at first sight, but quickly turns to boring toils when you replicate for each app, there should be a default home set, and there are few functions available so far, except fine for basic monitoring and lack of detailed quota is pain, but still being companion on the go is very nice, chunky pinch and zoom on chrome is not necessary any more."
