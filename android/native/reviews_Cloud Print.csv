1,Patrick Brown,"April 29, 2020",5, I Love the fact I can print when I am not at Home. I am Sad to find out that google will No long support it. I wish they would reconsider their decision. It is so easy to use all You do is select print and pick the cloud.

And yes I have installed according to instructions -- about 10 times !! And yes, the printer shows up in my list of printers in my Google Settings. And yes, I can print a page -- after about 20 requests. This is really mediocre work, Google !! I am shopping for a replacement printer, but Google's list of Chrome capatible printers is out of date. Sloppy job, Google !!! Cloud Print Sucks !!!"
4,Simon Grant,"April 27, 2020",1, Not a good experience at all. Installed the app on my device but it can't be found. Tried to get it working through the web from a pc which was also a big fail will uninstall and go back to printing off my pc .......

Uninstalled with immediate effect. Since last Google update UI not responding, apps not responding properly and so on. Is this another ploy to get me to buy another device or software? Don't think so. Rather go manual. Still not responding and now other apps keep crashing whilst some insist you have to pay for premium services to print wirelessly. Not a wise idea."
6,Michael Graubart,"February 20, 2020",1, Used Cloud Print regularly with HP and Epson printers. Currently using a Pixel 3 XL or something n Chrome on computer.

Currently using a Pixel 3 XL or something n Chrome on computer. Won't print to Epson WF-4740 or newest HP Officejet Pro 9250. Need to print for m off-site but app doesn't work. Now found out Google is canceling this app and Cloud Print entirely. HP Smart and Epson IPrint apps don't work well as Cloud print used to and disappointed to lose a valuable app.

God damn all of a sudden decided it wouldn't work. Keeps trying to connect to a printer that doesn't exist (it's removed from everywhere that I can think of that Cloud Print would look) but it just crashes and reloads in a loop that cant be stopped when you go to print using the app it is so frustrating that I can't open the app on my phone to delete the printer it is looking for!!!!!!!
8,Jacob Carnall,"February 15, 2020",1, Samsung Galaxy S10+ has a constant crash loop so this is completely unusable. It was working fine but for the past few months I've not been able to use it at all which is quite annoying because everything is on my Google drive.
9,Jane Quinn,"February 12, 2020",1," Installed, uninstalled, installed, uninstalled. Never shows as an option to print. No option to open the appa directly. No user guide to help. Terrible. Just wasted 30 minutes of valuable time with nothing to show for it."
10,Mukesh,"February 14, 2020",5," Please google fix for Samsung galaxy phone as it keeps crashing all time, had uninstall this app to use another printing option. Before android 10 it was great solution, but not anymore. Please fix it. Thank you. 5 stars are on the basis of how useful this app was before this crash issue."
11,Lawrence Kershaw,"February 18, 2020",1, Wow. Who would have thought any app could be this bad? Google really ought to give us the option of awarding no stars because even giving one implies that the app actually works. It doesn't: period.
12,Mic F,"March 11, 2020",5, Good app but only 3 stars until I'm able to move it to my SD drive. May uninstall for this reason and soon move on to competitor app that does. Update: 3/10/2020 The app is now able to be installed on the SD Drive. Giving it 5 stars. Thank you!
13,N i c u,"April 1, 2020",1, It keeps crashing everytime on s10+. Very annoying!!!!! I can't print from my phone. Please fix it! Works on older devices with android 8 or 9.
14,Bethany Brown,"April 20, 2020",1, Repeatedly comes up with an error message every time I attempt to use the app. Despite my phone being system restored recently this app still does not work properly
15,Brenda Smith,"April 21, 2020",1, no instruction given fit for setting up a printer for a chromebook. Cloud print does not work with chromebook would not recommend even considering anything with the word Chrome in it.

Then it would have got a better rating. Briefly. First follow instructions on the printer to register with Google services. Then login to Chrome with the same account as used on mobile device. The go to settings/advanced/printing/Google cloud print/manage cloud print devices. New printer should be there waiting for you. May need to go back to printer to accept.
17,Johan van Erkel,"March 10, 2020",1," This app is FULL of bugs. When installed on my S10e, the moment I press print in some app, the app keeps flashing and when you read quickly, you can see 'cloud print keeps stopping'. Don't download this app until it's fixed."
18,Lee Dunbar,"April 8, 2020",2," Repeatedly reversed the printed image to negative, then tried to tell me to update the firmware in my printer.... Nope, printer worked fine before cloud print was 'updated'. Half tested."

22,Gaurav Sharda,"April 18, 2020",1, This keeps on crashing every second. Unable to print. Setting reset every second it crashes. Fix it
23,Tahj Collins,"March 18, 2020",5, The Cloud Print is a good idea to typing in a computer that sent you working for now anyway can be used to download any other images pop up in this app or Google Drive to work on a regular schedule to earned it about the same option in my Android phone within the help of a Google account.

Now whenever I try to print anything (I only use the save to Google drive option) it just crashes immediately. Briefly flashes a notification that its crashed then repeats every second until I cancel the order to print. I've had to uninstall it and use the save to pdf built in then manually upload to Google drive.
25,Randy Gevermuehle,"February 19, 2020",5," I really like this feature, I think its terrible that google is doing away with it. Its a great service for printing to my house and having ready when i get there."
26,Jen Jen,"March 9, 2020",1, This service was shutdown December of 2019! Nice of Google to kill a useful tool that many people used and depended on. Haven't found a replacement yet. May just need to replace my Google phone with a more reliable company 👍
27,Tukadiya Dharmesh,"March 11, 2020",5, Best Cloud printing service !! But it is difficult to use on newer veersions of android . in begining it was showing errorr on galaxy s10 and mi k20 android mobiles! Otherwise it is awesome!!! I love this service!!
28,Daga shannon,"March 19, 2020",2, Has not been working with the BROTHER MFC for several months now. Used to work Really good and efficiently. - Hope that this Will work again wirelessly sometime soon in the near future. -
29,Gary Goodman,"December 27, 2019",5, Tentative 5 stars. I uninstalled. Looked for other option. Reinstalled. I was able to print/save PDF with 4 of 7 pages of article. -------------- Previous review: Used to work in past. Has been unable to print a local PDF or Google Drive cloud PDF for months. Preview screen is blank.
30,Kathy Owen,"March 7, 2020",1, still cannot print anything ever since I installed this. I may have to uninstall. I always printed my stuff before I installed the cloud print
31,Roger Castillo,"April 23, 2020",1, Wont work. From Google drive on muy browser works just fine. From apps on my android phone just wont print.

After a few seconds I get a notification to put the app to sleep as it's constantly crashing and opening and crashing again over and over. App hasn't been updated in months. Looks like Google are not interested in product support.
36,Andrea Nicole Burke,"February 11, 2020",5, This is the cloud print app that I have used in the past and now. It keeps everything you want too print off your phone safe and sound until you print it out. Google thank you 🌝
37,Jun Laroco,"March 13, 2020",4, It's buggy in the sense that on Note 10+ it keeps on sending error reports but you can still print. It's like it's blinking while on the preference page.
38,Chey Cline,"November 16, 2019",2," This is not very easy for those of us who are not very good with computers, phones,in the electronic generation. I wish I could have put a number as passwords get really old. I remember numbers easier than passwords. I feel like I have lost whatever I had there Chey"

40,Shawn Lugbauer,"January 5, 2020",1," This is great when it works. It's very difficult to set up, there are no clear instructions. It stopped working after using it for years: may not print at all or maybe several hours later, now will not connect to my printer at all. It is impossible to get any kind of tech support."

45,John Cooke,"April 27, 2020",3," Not obvious, but you can open the app by going to settings and scroll down to printing"
46,Eurith Rice,"January 2, 2020",5, Fairly easy to set up. Remember to first download Google print app to PC to be used as print server then set up on Android. Set up creates a cloud printer on Android. When connection to router is successful select target printer. Extra attention is required lf using legacy printers.
47,Jared Tweed,"April 15, 2020",5," Worked great, it could even connect to a printer that my computer struggled in connecting to."

52,aqif khan,"January 18, 2020",1, Would give it a zero star if possible. Works great if it works that is. Now all I get is an annoying flashing notification saying app is not working. By the looks of other reviews the company doesn't want to fix the problems within the app

71,Gustavo Serrano,"March 4, 2020",1, It's not clear that you need your computer and network to be active. There's no way to print direct from the phone using the same network as the printer. What a waste of time.
72,Kaseykins YT,"April 6, 2020",4, Never used it but its apart of the cloud and ths cloud is very important on a phone. So im assuming its really needed!

asking myself that question, but you have to admit the technology is 
amazing. I've been out walking, seen something interesting, taken a snap, 
and used cloud print to print the picture at home there and then, and my 
Son at home can see it, cool. Ultimately, I use this app at home to connect 
to my Epson printer. I'd much prefer to use Epson's own app, and connect 
locally via WiFi, rather than have to send my docs or photos via the Google 
Cloud which they obviously 'observe' as they do with everything, and take 
data from, but Epson's app didn't work with my model, so they probably want 
me to buy a new one, so I can't use dirt cheap compatible ink carts as I 
can with this one. Cynical huh? Cloud print works with most WiFi printers 
these days, old or new, and on just about every Android device I've ever 
owned. It's simple, effective, but lacks much in the way of pre-formatting, 
or print options. Windows phone made printing so easy compared to this, but 
it works, and from anywhere! ...even in the same room, and for that, it 
gets stars."
