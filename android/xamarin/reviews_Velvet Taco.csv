It is easy to use, works every time I go to use it, and makes the ordering process quick and easy. It's very nice being able to walk in past the long line that is generally present at all locations and pick up my food usually with very little to no wait."
1,Mark Feferman,"September 12, 2019",5, Fantastic concept all the way through delivery. Great food and help.
2,Matthew Floyd,"February 2, 2019",1, First order was good but orders last night and today cannot be placed because of Error Validating Basket.
3,Patrick Goldman,"May 5, 2019",1, Store in Chicago is marked as closed in observance of Cinco de Mayo but its packed to the rafters in person.
4,Anthony W. Terrell II.,"November 13, 2018",5, UNREAL!!!
5,DeAngalo Nesby,"January 21, 2018",5, I love Velvet Taco but the new location near me on Greenville in Dallas is SUPER slow. The mobile order pickup/drive-thru is supposed to be more convenient but it is not. It might as well be an actual drive-thru because the wait is just as long.
6,Luke English,"November 21, 2017",3, I like the app and it works quickly...but it doesn't save my card information even though I select that option. Please fix!
7,Brandon Mikeal,"July 27, 2018",3," Great app for ordering, but it does not save the CC information, you have 
to reenter your information each time."
8,Smiley Crump,"November 3, 2017",5, I run Favor and Uber orders from here. I decided to try to eat here now. Seems popular and customers are very friendly.
9,Donald Puckett,"May 8, 2018",5," Amazing tacos. Love the new location on Greenville. Drive through pick up 
is super convenient."
10,Jeane Jeffery,"September 11, 2018",5, Love app except can't figure out how to delete previous orders!
11,Richard Pfeil,"November 15, 2017",5," Best tacos around! Super friendly, and app is very convenient!"
12,Barbara McFarland Thomas,"July 21, 2018",5, Easy app. Put a velvet ðŸŒ® in South Grand Prairie Tx.
13,Sanjiv Goli,"October 15, 2017",5," Very useful app, saves so much time!"
