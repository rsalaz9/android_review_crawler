0,Detroit CPL,"February 3, 2020",1," Pick up works fine, delivery is forwarded to Postmate or another delivery service, no return number.. driver marked delivery as delivered when it was not.. Zoup store has NO access to the delivery person... no accountability at all..not the apps fault but this is a very poor set up.. period.."
1,Keith Lamb,"January 30, 2020",1, Order came wrong. No obvious way within the app to let them know so they can refund the items that were missing. (I'll update the review when/if this is taken care of).
