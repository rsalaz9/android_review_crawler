I prefer using an app for simplicity when following a recipe, but have to navigate to the website to look up recipe reviews and comments. Another feature that would be great would be if you could make your own notes on a recipe. I often make my own changes depending what I have in the larder/fridge so it would be helpful to add notes just for my own records."

Also a very slight irritant is the 'sign in successful! Welcome back ___' blocks the menu buttons at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds, so I have to wait for it to clear before I can look at my recipes."
2,Teresa Boreham,"April 18, 2020",1, Soooo Slooooow. Seriously would take ages to load anything. I could do it so much quicker with a search in their website. I have no issue with the content just the speed and the fact it would come up with Error unable to load data despite my wifi being on. Uninstalled and will stick to the website.

There are certain things that I can't search for. When Im halfway through searching, put down my phone and unlock again, the app almost crashes and i have to start over again. I've also caught the sign out button by mistake and cannot get back in. The website is very slow to load which I suspect is down to the current lockdown. Niggling things only."

Try to rest the password and again it takes me to the screen asking if I don't have an account I should create one. I'm trying to!
5,A Google user,"April 12, 2020",1," Loved it until an update a couple of weeks ago made it unusable. It wouldn't load any recipes, so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now it will not let me login. Very disappointing."
6,christopher shirley,"March 27, 2020",2," App crashes every time I open it Running on an older device (Android 5.1) but it has always run really well. Now however every time I open the app, it logs me in then immediately shuts down."
7,codsup man,"February 15, 2020",1," Android tablet version is rubbish! Always freezing, don't have access to the comment's, can't select highest rating first, very often it says no internet and can't connect to the point you have to delete app and reinstall. This version is just awful."
8,Octavia Oprea,"April 19, 2020",3," The dishes are amazing but the app functionality is the worse I have met. Ia taking up to 7 seconds to open and load home page and I m always getting errors when I search, like no result or data load fail."
9,Andy Young,"February 15, 2020",4," The app is great. The ads are a little annoying but that's minor. My only real gripe is; does it have to ask if I want to set up/add to a collection every single time I save a recipe? Surely this can be turned off, or at least give me the option to."
10,Rebecca Herbert,"April 6, 2020",1," Have uploaded app and cannot go any further as have not recieved the confirmation email (to a hotmail account). Have tried multiple times. Please address this, thank you"
11,Richard Hanney,"April 18, 2020",3, Works when it feels like it. When it does work and you open it the loading banner stays on for ages over the tabs. Badly designed.

I already had an account, but had forgotten the password. The reset automatically signs you in, but only on the website so you can't find out what your password is. I created a new one (using lastpass) but the sign in screen on the app doesn't allow you to paste in the password. So I had to write it down, then type it back in. Once in the app there are no search results, I just get errors. Please fix!"
14,Tally Lorens,"February 17, 2020",3, I love the recipes but it really annoys me that you cannot see reviews as the comments on them usually help improve a recipe. Also it often thinks I am offline and won't let me search recipes even though I have 4g/ Wi-Fi.

The web site was great and the best bit was reading the comments to work out the good and the bad, but also for how people have varied the recipe which was really useful. Why is this not available in the app as some of the tweaks that people have added really add to the recipes. Are we supposed to use the app and the site? That's makes no sense people."

As others have said reading the comments and substitutions and other changes people have made to the recipes is all part of the process of finding something new to cook. Will go back to the web based site.
18,John Dunkley,"March 25, 2020",2, It doesn't seem to show the recipes that you get on the BBC food website which is really frustrating. Why aren't they the same? Feedback would be appreciated.
19,Bert Popping,"December 24, 2019",2," Some good recipes - way too many and intrusive ads! Some decent recipes (mind you, I'm saying this about a British recipe collection! üòÅ). However, the number and size of ads is more than irritating. Not sure if it's worth keeping the app. No option of payment to remove ads."
20,Neil Anderson,"November 30, 2019",1," Like others, can't paste my email and password into the login screen, so no point in wasting any more time trying to go any further. Similar user review took 2.5 months for a response which basically said we'll think about it. Uninstalled. Developers need a user experience tutorial."
21,Dion Pathmaperuma,"January 11, 2020",1," This app had so much promise but 2 days after installing it keeps saying no internet connection and search function doesn't work, when clearly this is not the case. The only way to resolve it is to restart the phone. I won't be doing this so will probably delete if it doesn't get resolved."
22,Heather Royles,"March 27, 2020",3," It's alright, but disappointed the browser-based shopping list features don't seem to carry across to the app."
23,Kirsty Price,"April 18, 2020",1, Tried creating an account using Facebook and 2 different emails but I get an error everytime so it's completely useless as you can't use the app without an account!
24,Scott Laing,"January 19, 2020",3," Good app with great recipes. My only gripe is that the different advert sizes make the page jump up and down, very annoying while half way through cooking. Either use a fixed space for the advert or stop it changing when in cooking mode to stop it shifting content."
25,Dan Clement,"April 20, 2020",1, Apparently i am using the wrong password. I canconnect on the app. But not on the site.... lots of work to be done here and lots of competition out there so...
26,Liz Playz,"February 26, 2020",5," Much better than Tasty app.....i love the website and the app is great shortcut, everything condensed into one handy little app, excellent selection of recipes, layout of app is very simple,i recommend 10/10."
27,Tina M69,"January 23, 2020",5," Great App, loads of recipes and ideas, also recipe mode to keep the screen active. As others have mentioned it would be great to have the shopping list available on the app as it is on the website."
28,orla o callaghan,"February 7, 2020",5," Great app with lots of really great recipes. All organised into categories like healthy meals, family dinners etc. Definitely my favourite app for recipes and I love that I can save my favourites"
29,Big Boss616,"February 2, 2020",3," Very convenient app but cannot give it full stars, it is missing the crucial recipe tips (available on the website) part from the recipes"
30,Isabel Hole,"December 26, 2019",4," Good app, able to read recipes and find recipes easily Would be better if you could read reviews for the recipes. You can see how it has been rated but you are unable to read people's comments like you can online"
31,Katie Chedburn,"February 23, 2020",3," It shows recipes and how ever many stars, but you can't actually go to reviews on the app, which defeats the purpose as msot of the best information is in the comments"

I'm going back to searching on line and deleting this app. Very poor especially considering it's the bbc"
33,David Cantello,"April 9, 2020",1, It frequently states that there is no internet connection when there patently and verifiably is.
34,Myfanwy Liddle,"October 1, 2019",3," Love the website, but the app could do with a few improvements.

Mainly it rarely synchs properly so you spend ages waiting, and if you add recipes on the website it often doesn't show in the app. Also you can't print from the app, why on earth not? I get that printing is less environmentallly friendly, but surely it should be a choice. And finally you can't read the comments in the app! This is a major flaw as the comments are often as useful as the recipe. Please sort this out!"
35,Reece Blair,"December 29, 2019",4, love this app!! would of gave 5 stars but I would really love the option to add the ingredients to a shopping list like the internet version. I hope someone sees this and it can be added in the next update.
36,Grace Law,"April 18, 2020",2," Crashes all the time, won't load stuff nearly every time I open it"
37,James Varney,"December 18, 2019",3, A great way of accessing the recipes. However one of my favourite parts of the website was a shopping list. Why is this function not available on the app?
38,Paul Dowman,"December 30, 2019",2," Riddled with adverts. Not one or two, but loads of them, very disappointing. Prefer the website version, ad blockers on the browser make the website much more useable."

40,Kitty Farren,"January 6, 2020",3," I love the recipes on this app but for the past few days all my requests (searches, password reset and cookbook viewing) have timed out making the app unusable. I can't even sign in."
41,Catherine Shipley,"December 27, 2019",4, I love the app but it doesn't have the 'tips' section from the website. Chefs often use that bit to provide side dish recipes so I have to use both the app and the site

43,Ellie Wheatley,"April 19, 2020",1," Nothing is loading, or syncing and there appear to be no recipes to load"
44,Rebekah Copham,"January 11, 2020",2, The best part of BBC good food are the comments by people who have tried the recipes. The app loses all of the value by not providing access to the comments. I'd rather be on the website.

75,Stefan Iseli,"December 15, 2019",1, Can't even register or sign in with Google/Facebook. Nothing happens on button click... So not usable.
76,Garry Frost,"September 19, 2018",2," Well I'd like to give it a good review but I can't, went out today and brought all the ingredients for one of my saved recipient and when I opened the app it just won't work, just keeps saying syncing recipes! Half hour I've been trying to cook, probably easier to just Google what you want to cook!"
77,Joel Armstrong,"December 30, 2019",2," Too many adds. With it being part of the BBC, I thought it wouldn't have any!"
78,Emma Willcocks,"January 25, 2020",4, Its a good app but I wish there was a comment section under the recipies where people can add variations they have tried or at least written reviews so the recipes can be improved

Then I'm told to validate email which has not arrived. Frustrating! Uninstalled and tried again with different email but still no joy. (different email address but still no validating email) Have installed another app which works well.
80,Sarahninja8816,"January 8, 2020",5, Absolutely amazing recipes. Full of easy quick recipes if your not a big cook or in a hurry. Also recipes that are full of family warmth.
81,David Hunt,"April 8, 2019",1," I got a pop-up from the website asking me to install the app. Great! I thought, it would be useful to have a mobile friendly version of the website in the app. Immediately after installation I'm presented with a login screen. Nope. Un-installed. Why on Earth is this forced on me?"
82,Nathanael Latham,"February 27, 2019",4," Good app and nicely set out. The only thing it's missing is to be able to read the recipe reviews. In the reviews there are often great tips and additions to the recipes, which is why I still use BBCGF website more then I do the app."
83,Ian Hobbs,"September 27, 2019",5," Love it as it is so easy to use with brilliant food ideas from worldwide,and how many lifetimes would it take to do 10,000 recipes.

84,Joe Lonsdale,"September 8, 2019",3," A pretty lumpy app! No way to print off a recipe without poor formatting and a billion adverts ruining everything (cup cake recipe resulted in 12 pages). The recipes themselves are okay though, at least the ones I've tried, but it's easier to write it down by hand than print it off!"
85,Emma Tully,"October 8, 2019",1, Awful app. Spends ages synching then you cant open your recipes. Won't let me open a recipe I've searched for and kicks you back to the home page.

Takes recipes out of my collections when synching. No copy and paste for shopping list. And no sign of forthcoming improvements from the developers. Better off just using chrome or internet.

I gave it another go, to no avail and have deleted the app. It's a shame as I really like the BBC food website. Not even being able to log on to the app was a real let down."
87,Lyn Penfold,"November 17, 2018",1," Endless loop if you've got an account but have forgotten your password: the emailed link takes you straight back to the sign in page, but if you've forgotten your password...etc. What a shame."
88,Billy Ingram,"April 20, 2020",1, Doesn't allow autosaved password or password to be pasted into the password box
89,Sam Brock,"November 16, 2018",1," The recipes and the layout are fine...if you have 4 hours to wait for them to load. Unfortunately indicative of every BBC site/app that exists, almost great, but always always, some terrible functionality. BBC, ever heard of software testers?"
90,Emily Meltham,"September 30, 2018",4," It's a decent app, but it runs really slowly on my phone, even when I've just restarted it and even when I'm connected to Wi-Fi not 4G. If it ran quicker, it would be 5*."
91,Joanne Brothers,"August 6, 2019",1, Was really good now a disaster. Now asks me to sign in which I try to do with Google then get a database error message and all my content of 60+ recipes have disappeared. If I log in on windows pc all present and correct. I HAVE TRIED TO EMAIL YOU BUT NO ONE RESPONDS.
92,A Google user,"March 20, 2019",2," Good recipes but navigation around the app is terrible. Once you have clicked into a recipe to view it there is no back button, you have to click home and enter all your search parameters again. Just use the website!"
93,Julie-Anne King,"April 16, 2019",3, I really like this app however not having the reviews on there which are handy for extra tips is a real mistake as for me and many others it's our favourite bit. If this is added then would be a 5 star app.
94,A Google user,"September 17, 2018",5, Love this app! Easy to use. I can't seem to read reviews for the recipes however. That would be great if I could! I just pop on to the website to check usually but would make for a smoother process.

96,John Wood,"November 16, 2019",5," Very useful to use and very good offers to be had, also really great recipes for wonderful food."
97,Ron Lightfoot,"April 24, 2019",1, I've had to uninstall and poorly rate this App solely for the reason it wouldn't let me paste my password to log in. I use a password generator which provides me with very complicated intricate passwords. I couldn't be bothered to mess around with it. Sorry BBC
98,A Google user,"February 5, 2019",3," It was good for a while, now it just says could not load data whenever you search something (even if i have wifi). The app is still not working."
99,Gessica Ceravolo,"July 18, 2019",5," Very helpful app, especially if you want to keep an eye on your calories intake. It offers a wide variety of recipes that you can easily find browsing through categories. Would definitely recommend it!"
100,Sarah Green,"March 8, 2019",2, This app is a great idea but definitely needs some tweaks.... priority number 1 is being able to read reviews of recipes. What's the point of telling me there are 40 reviews of a dish but not being able to access them?
101,Tommy M,"March 21, 2019",5, Excellent app with a huge variety of recipes from simple to complex. Directions are clear and easy to follow along with also. Highly recommended.
102,Rebecca Davies,"September 14, 2019",4, Substanial amount of recipes that are easy to follow but app doesn't have the same functionality as the web pages. Frustrating that you cannot sort recipes by top reviewed first plus cannot see comments posted about a recipe
103,Alex Bowker,"October 14, 2019",4," Good app, easy to find recipes. Would be nice to be able to read comments left by other reviewers to see if they've altered the recipe instead of just reviewing a recipe."
104,Chris King,"March 7, 2020",1, Can't create an account using Facebook Gmail or email so can't use the app.
105,David Fletcher,"March 19, 2020",3, Great recipes but the app is so slow at times
106,Steve Hankin,"October 31, 2018",2," Very flaky. Kept failing to auth via Google last week. Now if you login and switch apps it says ""no internet""...But I verified that I do have 100mbps over WiFi currently"

108,Bryan Charman,"April 27, 2019",1, sign in with google or Facebook functions don't work and I'm still waiting for my confirmation email before i can sign in...until then it's a useless app. Just go on the website
109,Louise Chamberlain,"September 28, 2019",1," I wish this app actually worked. It was so full of bugs I couldn't even get in. Repeated cookies notifications on the same page, broken links, and inability to reset password. A real shame..."
110,Daniel Rees,"September 30, 2018",2, This app is so slow. Takes forever to load recipes and searches. And for some reason it takes a lot of power to run the app
111,A Google user,"December 24, 2018",5, Great app so many things to cook. Also it's so easy to follow with all the ingredients listed and the great step by step method on how to actually make it
112,Simon Manning-Press,"April 26, 2019",3," Its ok but could be so much better. Access to reviews is key when choosing a recipe, and ads are too interuptive of the browsing experience"
113,James Burrell,"September 18, 2018",2," Can't login with Google, once I finally got into the app I got errors when searching. Oddly now it's working but some searches never load..."
114,russell burrows,"September 25, 2019",1," Couldn't log in, kept redirecting me back to the beginning, wouldn't take any password, completely useless, just like the BBC really, don't bother trying it, just cut and paste from their website recipes."

120,Sophie Steed,"October 13, 2018",1, Won't let me login either with Google or by inputting my email and password. Therefore app is useless as you can't access anything without logging in.
121,Peter Rhodes,"November 25, 2018",2," Irritating notifications and no easily visible way to disable them. Automatic uninstall from me. If you're a recipe app, notifications should be disabled by default. Obviously not important enough to nag people's attention"
122,Eddie Curtis,"September 30, 2018",3," The recipes are great but everything loads slowly. Please implement caching or work on the app performance, it shouldn't take over a minute to download recipes that I already saved."
123,Nick Abbott,"September 30, 2019",5," This app would be 6 stars if it is had the function to ""copy ingredients"" so they could be pasted into a shopping list. Otherwise very impressed."

145,Lisa Jones,"March 23, 2019",2, deleted after 5 minutes because all it did was freeze or take ages to load. Website is far less hassle

At the moment you have to open the recipe to save it and when you go back to the list it brings you back to the top rather than where you were, so it can be quite annoying to scroll down again, especially when looking at large collections."

Google assistant always points me in this websites direction so I'd thought I'd give the app a punt.easy to navigate nice and smooth running on the pixle 2. I love the nutritional information this is a great thing for those counting calories on a diet/life style change. It would be nice if you could customise your profile for allergies so the app would avoid certain things or even give you alternatives something to think about in an update maybe? I would recommend this to friends :)

Works well online and offline, although it can still be a little temperamental with unreliable connections because it tries to sign in and gets stuck when the connection drops.  Good app with a great selection of recipes - especially love the collections for niche audiences, such as dopamine-boosting recipes."

The only thing missing is the comments sections. Reading comments for every recipe before you try prevents so many disasters in the kitchen! Please add them to the app as well.
375,Eleanor Savill,"February 24, 2018",2," This app is great if you want to look at 1 recipe. If you're browsing through a few though, it's torture. Exiting a recipe takes you right back to the top meaning you have to scroll right back down the list again. I feel like this is such a basic function to have been overlooked!"
376,A Google user,"March 10, 2018",3," Two main issues, it gets stuck loading when you scroll and the back button takes you to the home page instead of the previously viewed page. These two things mean it's hard to quickly view and save recipies. For me, the app is not usable. Pity, because the recipies are good."
377,Ed Jones,"February 25, 2018",3," A good app BUT it keeps losing its Internet connection, even when the rest of my apps are online. The only way to remedy is to Force Close. Frustrating."
378,Jason Shek,"December 29, 2017",2," I like the layout, but the app keeps crashing even on a LG G6. I'll stick to the website for now.  Edit - new update means no more crashes. Thank you for the response."

It's very frustrating to have to scroll through hundreds of recipes to continue my search. A temporary bookmark for search would be great.  *Invite to app/ tell √† friend button would be great.  *If I leave app to read a message or perform another task on my mobile, when I return to app I'm back at the gf homepage again.  * Recipes I previously deleted still appear in my saved recipes section. It would be great to be able to delete multiple recipes at once.  *Recipes I saved and category I created on app have in faut not been saved or created.  Looks like I'll be sticking with the gf website for the foreseeable future.  Keep up the good work."
380,Jenny Sharpe,"February 10, 2018",4, Fantastic app love the save feature in my food with different collection. Only thing missing is an option to share recipes through messenger whatsapp etc. with that it would def be 5 üåü
381,A Google user,"March 6, 2018",3," What I can view, lovely recipes. I view a selection of recipes, then it freezes. Can scroll, Can't view. Very annoying. App finally crashes."
382,AMANDA WATKIN,"February 13, 2018",3, Great recipes but the app keeps signing me in and out while I try to search the recipes! Very annoying.
383,Becky Wallis,"December 24, 2017",3, It's OK. But you can't see comments and reviews for a recipe which I'd the main reason I use this site. Back to the normal browser version until this is sorted.
384,Dennis Silva,"December 29, 2017",4," The weak point is research, somewhat limited. Eg: You can not find more than one ingredient and other languages ‚Äã‚Äã(for ""alho"" typed in Pt-br, search for garlic, etc.)."
385,Jenny Wass,"January 2, 2018",3," Nicely designed app, but it's frustrating to not be able to share recipes. I hope the gesture will be added soon otherwise I'll delete the app and go back to using the website."
386,Fotini Trakasopulu,"February 4, 2018",2," Very slow, app always crashes unexpectedly. Dont download, better to use internet version, this also saves storage as no need to download app. Good recipies, rubbish app."

Would be better if it remembered were you were when browsing collections as it currently takes you back to the top of the list if you go back from having looked at a particular recipe. Also needs an option added to remove saved recipes from your own collection which only seems to be offered at the point you've added a recipe. Otherwise you need to log in to a pc to edit your saved recipes. All in all however, great app!"
388,Emily Adams,"January 29, 2018",5, So excited there's an app for good food now! Every recipe I've tried from here has turned out amazingly! Love love love it. It would be good idea you could leave comments on the recipe though! Otherwise it's fabulous!
389,Stephen fuller,"February 16, 2018",3, Adverts? Why are there advert surly the my licence fee pays for this? Its free but still didn't expect it one of the reason I choose a BBC app not a random one.
390,Darren Harrison,"March 6, 2018",2, Account set up reqd for no reason adverts never stop.searching is like using windows xp.slow and no help at all.but it does have some good recipes.
391,Billy Pike,"February 3, 2018",5, This is brilliant as I always saved the recipes to my home screen on my phone I had over 150 saved so much better then keep going on the website.is there anyway to just search the chef you would like to view there recipes
392,Sarukh Molla,"January 27, 2018",1, This is a very Bad app I'm many times sign in this app but not open the app   Please help me good food team guaid and open the app
393,Adrian Wood,"January 1, 2018",4," Would be great if once you'd read a recipe you go.back to where you started as opposed to right back at the start. Other than that, all good so far"

395,Pete,"February 15, 2018",3, Nice app. Would like to be able to see the user comments same as on the website as this is where you can get the best tips for the recipe.

400,E Hastings,"January 5, 2018",3, Would be great addition if you could add a hyperlink to other recipes from across the web in collections.
401,Derek Dymond,"March 10, 2018",1, I pay my licence fee for no advertising. Why is it on a BBC app?

403,Claire Leivers,"February 18, 2018",4, Very good but I still use the website in preference at the moment as I like to read the reviews
404,Ammara Majeed,"February 11, 2018",1, Why does it ask for your email address and password?
405,A Google user,"February 26, 2018",2, The reviews are essential in deciding which recipes to use. Without them this app is pretty lame.

When I open a recipe I have to scroll to the top of it because it opens always at the bottom. When I switch to another app and return back it shows me the homepage but not a recipe I switched from. I'd like to have an ability to select words in a recipe to translate them. Thanks!
416,Robert Ian Hamilton,"November 8, 2017",4," I have the Win 10 version on my laptop which I love.  This version is quite good except it keeps crashing every time I try to use the ""Healthy"" meals section. Please fix this."
417,Dec,"October 30, 2017",4, Good start. Few bugs need to be ironed out (such as crashes when looking at categories) and would be nice to be able to share recipes

427,Bradley Taylor,"February 3, 2018",2," The signup process never sent me the validation email, locking me out of the app. I could have emailed the good food team for them to unblock my account, but frankly that's too much effort when the website works without login. A shame."
