Lot of other weather apps bombard you with all unnessary information all at once, and it can make looking for what you need at that moment hard to find (and unpleasant to look at). For example, opening the Timeline shows detailed information about current weather conditions, and directly under that a ""card"" that shows conditions for the rest of the day graphically. Below that is another card that does the same for tomorrow in a clear and concise format. And rather than clutter the charts to show forecasts for each hour even though the temperature might be the same for the entire period -- that end up forcing you to scroll to see the rest of the day -- these chart summarize the period in a way only shows when there are increases or decreases, letting you see both the trends clearly. Brilliant! Even Dark Sky involved a lot of scrolling to see a single day's forecast (and only showed data every 2 hours anyway). Finally, the developer is extremely responsive and committed to future development of the app. So glad I found my new weather app. And great widgets too!",5

For instance, the app will tell me it is going to start raining in 15 minutes, but there is not a cloud in the sky. I might end up cancelling my subscription if this apps accuracy isn't improved. What good is a weather app if it can't predict the weather?",3

Appy Weather,News,low," I really like the app and the way that it gives you weather information. It's simplistic and has minimalistic widgets.

Appy Weather,News,low, Nicely set up app that looks great. Decided to subscribe to the full version to get the radar & was very disappointed. The radar is just a link to a site that I can get for free anytime. This app gets 5 stars for the free version but only 3 for the paid because of the the lack of built in radar.,3

I gave it a try, but I will stick to my Google Assistant. BTW, I did give the app permission to use my location. So that's not an excuse",1
Appy Weather,News,low," Fantastic app! Really beautiful and clean interface, detailed forecast and weather in different modes(street, area, city). I'm using this app for 2 weeks and already it is my primary weather app. Good Job devs, keep doing great work!!",5
Appy Weather,News,low," Very good app, what really calls my attention is the minimal design. I really like the big bold numbers, as the icons and rounded corners as well. Still can't decide what theme is my favorite: light or dark.",5
Appy Weather,News,low," This is a really nice user friendly weather app. Bardi the dev responded immediately to my original comment, so the fifth star and a donation. I then saw that he'd done Ruff, so I've downloaded that too. Both save to SD card which is an added bonus. (And he's in the UK...)",5
Appy Weather,News,low, Love this app. It is very simple and easy to use. It gives you a more detailed outline of the weather from daily to hours and a timeline. I love the widgets too. Definitely recomend this app. Thank you,5

Appy Weather,News,low," Appy is great, I tested all the editors choice weather apps and this is by far the best. I have to cap my rating at 4 stars though as Dark Sky support/accuracy is really bad out of a few countries. So the app is great but the info it provides is not.",4
Appy Weather,News,low," Great looking app. It performs well. Wish it had more widget features such as transparency and a streaming weather update feature like stock tickers. Overall, highly satisfied with the experience.",5
Appy Weather,News,low," This is a fantastic weather app. Not only is it rich with data like their other app, Dark Skies which it's also awesome), it presents your weather in a meaningful, narrative way. Def my favorite!",5
Appy Weather,News,low, Can only give 4 stars because when you first add a widget to the home screen its invisible. You have to wait for a few minutes before the data shows but its disconcerting and not obvious that you need to wait.,4
Appy Weather,News,low," Purchased the app for the radar. Only to see the radar does not have playability. If you want to see the future, you have to put the date and time into the radar. A rather useless feature.",2
Appy Weather,News,low," Beautiful weather app, the design is very modern with a simplistic approach which is very refreshing! The developer is very prompt in taking in the feedback and getting the issues resolved.",5
Appy Weather,News,low," It's ok, definitely not worth a subscription fee for a widget and the so called other features available. I would have bought the app but a subscription fee for a weather app is just greedy.",1

Appy Weather,News,low, So the widget disappearing problem seems to be fixed. I appreciate the continuous hard work put into it. It's one of the best apps on my entire phone. Thanks!,5
Appy Weather,News,low, This is a great clean weather app. Ads are non-intrusive (don't think I have even seen one yet) and the design is great. Would recommend!,5
Appy Weather,News,low, The review notification is annoying.,3
Appy Weather,News,low, Comparing weather prediction with what I see out my window has been spot on. Can't get better than that. Would like to see a little more work on the radar. But this is by far the best weather app I've found.,4
Appy Weather,News,low," This is very helpful, it is very accurate,it is very windy where I live and this app can know the speed of the wind,HIGHLY recommended",5
Appy Weather,News,low, I like the design. Sadly Dark sky is very inaccurate in most of EU. Would be great to have other weather data providers to choose from.,4
Appy Weather,News,low, Happy with the purchase and worth the few Euros. More personable than many of the weather apps out there. Honestly for the product you get the price is more than fair,5

Appy Weather,News,low, Like it so far. What happens though when Dark Sky is an Apple product and this can't use them any longer???,4
Appy Weather,News,low, Great UI design. Very intuitive and informative. I use the radar a lot on other apps. Not 5 stars because radar is only stationary. Would be perfect if radar function was equivalent to other apps.,4
Appy Weather,News,low," I didn't think I'd find a better weather app, but this is more detailed than any other. I opted to subscribe yearly for it almost immediately",5
Appy Weather,News,low," Great app with plenty of free features. It looks great, has easy to use controls, and the price per year isn't too bad at all.",5
Appy Weather,News,low, Really like this app. Have returned to it after a break and it has improved markedly. All the information you would want is there.,5

Appy Weather,News,low, I've been a long time fan of DarkSky so I was curious if this app would add value. It's absolutely a better way to view DarkSky data.,5

Appy Weather,News,low," Well done, this app is so refreshing when you compare to more traditional weather apps. I upgraded to pro version straight off the bat.",5
Appy Weather,News,low, Very simple ugi and information accurate I would give it 5 stars if radar was able to show movement of storm systems not just a static display,4

(different email address but still no validating email) Have installed another app which works well.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Absolutely amazing recipes. Full of easy quick recipes if your not a big cook or in a hurry. Also recipes that are full of family warmth.,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," I got a pop-up from the website asking me to install the app. Great! I thought, it would be useful to have a mobile friendly version of the website in the app. Immediately after installation I'm presented with a login screen. Nope. Un-installed. Why on Earth is this forced on me?",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Good app and nicely set out. The only thing it's missing is to be able to read the recipe reviews. In the reviews there are often great tips and additions to the recipes, which is why I still use BBCGF website more then I do the app.",4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Love it as it is so easy to use with brilliant food ideas from worldwide,and how many lifetimes would it take to do 10,000 recipes.

BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," A pretty lumpy app! No way to print off a recipe without poor formatting and a billion adverts ruining everything (cup cake recipe resulted in 12 pages). The recipes themselves are okay though, at least the ones I've tried, but it's easier to write it down by hand than print it off!",3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Awful app. Spends ages synching then you cant open your recipes. Won't let me open a recipe I've searched for and kicks you back to the home page.

BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Endless loop if you've got an account but have forgotten your password: the emailed link takes you straight back to the sign in page, but if you've forgotten your password...etc. What a shame.",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Doesn't allow autosaved password or password to be pasted into the password box,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," The recipes and the layout are fine...if you have 4 hours to wait for them to load. Unfortunately indicative of every BBC site/app that exists, almost great, but always always, some terrible functionality. BBC, ever heard of software testers?",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," It's a decent app, but it runs really slowly on my phone, even when I've just restarted it and even when I'm connected to Wi-Fi not 4G. If it ran quicker, it would be 5*.",4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Was really good now a disaster. Now asks me to sign in which I try to do with Google then get a database error message and all my content of 60+ recipes have disappeared. If I log in on windows pc all present and correct. I HAVE TRIED TO EMAIL YOU BUT NO ONE RESPONDS.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Good recipes but navigation around the app is terrible. Once you have clicked into a recipe to view it there is no back button, you have to click home and enter all your search parameters again. Just use the website!",2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, I really like this app however not having the reviews on there which are handy for extra tips is a real mistake as for me and many others it's our favourite bit. If this is added then would be a 5 star app.,3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Love this app! Easy to use. I can't seem to read reviews for the recipes however. That would be great if I could! I just pop on to the website to check usually but would make for a smoother process.,5

BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Very useful to use and very good offers to be had, also really great recipes for wonderful food.",5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, I've had to uninstall and poorly rate this App solely for the reason it wouldn't let me paste my password to log in. I use a password generator which provides me with very complicated intricate passwords. I couldn't be bothered to mess around with it. Sorry BBC,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," It was good for a while, now it just says could not load data whenever you search something (even if i have wifi). The app is still not working.",3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Very helpful app, especially if you want to keep an eye on your calories intake. It offers a wide variety of recipes that you can easily find browsing through categories. Would definitely recommend it!",5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, This app is a great idea but definitely needs some tweaks.... priority number 1 is being able to read reviews of recipes. What's the point of telling me there are 40 reviews of a dish but not being able to access them?,2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Excellent app with a huge variety of recipes from simple to complex. Directions are clear and easy to follow along with also. Highly recommended.,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Substanial amount of recipes that are easy to follow but app doesn't have the same functionality as the web pages. Frustrating that you cannot sort recipes by top reviewed first plus cannot see comments posted about a recipe,4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Good app, easy to find recipes. Would be nice to be able to read comments left by other reviewers to see if they've altered the recipe instead of just reviewing a recipe.",4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Can't create an account using Facebook Gmail or email so can't use the app.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Great recipes but the app is so slow at times,3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Very flaky. Kept failing to auth via Google last week. Now if you login and switch apps it says ""no internet""...But I verified that I do have 100mbps over WiFi currently",2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Really good app. Love the recipes as they are straight forward, easy to understand measurements and quick to make! Highly recommended it!!!",5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, sign in with google or Facebook functions don't work and I'm still waiting for my confirmation email before i can sign in...until then it's a useless app. Just go on the website,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," I wish this app actually worked. It was so full of bugs I couldn't even get in. Repeated cookies notifications on the same page, broken links, and inability to reset password. A real shame...",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, This app is so slow. Takes forever to load recipes and searches. And for some reason it takes a lot of power to run the app,2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Great app so many things to cook. Also it's so easy to follow with all the ingredients listed and the great step by step method on how to actually make it,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Its ok but could be so much better. Access to reviews is key when choosing a recipe, and ads are too interuptive of the browsing experience",3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Can't login with Google, once I finally got into the app I got errors when searching. Oddly now it's working but some searches never load...",2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Couldn't log in, kept redirecting me back to the beginning, wouldn't take any password, completely useless, just like the BBC really, don't bother trying it, just cut and paste from their website recipes.",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Invalid Request when logging in with Google as other users have experienced. Logged in with Facebook instead. Good ideas here though.,4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," I do like this app, but would love option to pay to remove ads, they are starting to become a tad intrusive.",4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," ok for storing recipes, but not so good for browsing for new recipes. Not as good as the website. Can't see reviews or tips on the app.",3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Can't read comments from others who have already tried the recipes. I'm going to uninstall this app right away and go back to using the website.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Not loading recipes even though good fast signal.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Won't let me login either with Google or by inputting my email and password. Therefore app is useless as you can't access anything without logging in.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Irritating notifications and no easily visible way to disable them. Automatic uninstall from me. If you're a recipe app, notifications should be disabled by default. Obviously not important enough to nag people's attention",2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," The recipes are great but everything loads slowly. Please implement caching or work on the app performance, it shouldn't take over a minute to download recipes that I already saved.",3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," This app would be 6 stars if it is had the function to ""copy ingredients"" so they could be pasted into a shopping list. Otherwise very impressed.",5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," It is not working, the log in tabs are not active.",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Can't log in to app, even when I try to reset password the email that is sent has no link. Tried numerous different times an every time the is no link attached",1

BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, absolutely love this app. it's a godsend! can look up recipes when Im shopping and it's great for helping me meal plan.,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Loaded quickly and accepted my Google login but search always brings up nothing. Too many intrusive ads. Uninstalled.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, The app is way too slow to load recipes. Best take screenshots if you plan to cook something from here.,3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, often fails to sync or slow to open. Great when it works though.,3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Works occasionally, but recently become unresponsive in the evenings, exactly when you need it!!!!!!",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," had problems with sign in and uninstalled the app, customer service contacted me promptly and resolved the problem immediately. enjoying the app now",5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Unable to login with Google account, gives error message as other users have reported. No customer support to repair issues. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APP RILL FIXED",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Always worked fine for me on any device and the recipes are easy to follow and are, least the ones I've tried, really good!",5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," pretty good app. would be an improvement if the shopping basket tool was included in the app, future improvement maybe.",4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Cannot login with Google, useless as I have recipes stored from when I had iPad ( iOS app has no issues);fix please",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Loads of lovely recipes. Easy to search and save them in folders.,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Great app.. useful to have an option to prevent the tablet ftom switching off while cooking. And I like being able to create and keep my own collections,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," I don't like to feel forced to create an account just to try the app, this should be optional",2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," As ither mentioned, it's not possible to log in, tried both Google log in and Facebook and neither button does anything.",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Just waste of time. Can't use without login. And login is not working. Uninstalled the app.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Fantastic resource. Highly recommended. The best cooking app and website. Thanks Beeb.,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Disappointed to find ads all the way through it especially as it's associated to the ad free BBC. Deleted.,2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, deleted after 5 minutes because all it did was freeze or take ages to load. Website is far less hassle,2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Yet another app that doesn't allow the pasting of passwords during registration. Uninstalled immediately.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Terrible app. Full of bugs rendering it useless. Really poor from the BBC.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, unfortunately the app keep telling me there is no internet connection and freezes while internet works perfectly.,1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Great app but a shame you can only rate the recipe and can't read comments made by other users who have made the recipe and suggest tweaks like you can on the website,4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Unbelievably slow to load up the recipes. Such a shame as if this app worked properly it would be so useful.,2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Can't even make an account or log in? Such a shame,1

BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Can't sign in with Google and when I try sorting an account it won't let me create a new password..... I think I'll just go buy a cookbook,2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, really good app for looking up recipe's but would like to see the add the shopping list/add to basket feature added to the app,4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, The app works well for me but it definitely needs reviews/comments and tips available to view like on the website,4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Sign in screen none responsive, forgotten password email never comes. Sadly it's broken.",1
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Sign in with Google not working. Can't get into my recipes at all anymore.,1

BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, There's a meal for everyone on this app. Perfect for being on a budget as well.,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, One of the main reasons I love BBC good food so much are the reviews. The app doesn't show any of the reviews. Will stick to the website.,3

BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, I love the app. but would be a 5 star if it showed the reviews and the tips like the website.,4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Average at best. No print function. so unless you like your technogy in the kitchen dont bother,2
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Nice layout but doesn't save the recipe half of the time so defeats the object a little bit.,3
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, Great for storing recipes you like to keep at hand.,5
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low," Please make a built in shopping list, would make it even better",4
BBC Good Food,Entertainment,low, I love BBC good food but it is frustrating not being able to see receipe review comments on the app as this means that I always have to use the web version,3

Why not just have an input so people can type it in rather than having to tap arrows on hundreds of date screens? The app is pretty much worthless. Can't really do anything with it and also the password reset doesn't work. Most likely the high reviews are fake.,1

I did leave a bad review in the beginning but BBVA Associates did do their best to help me and I really appreciate that more than they can imagine, I give him a five out of five star rating since they actually tried to make contact with me and get them settled.

BBVA,News,medium, calling BBVA yields no information about the purpose of the daily accruing notification alerts nor the information they are purposed to convey. Business as usual.,4

It is structured like a puzzle that has to be navigated like a maze and often can not tell you the information you seek. The website is simple and informative. Hopefully future plans for this app are to simplify. The help feature tends to send you in circles looking at features that you likely have seen already while looking for what you needed. Try to answer these questions in a few minutes. What is my interest rate, how long is my special rate on a purchase, how much was the payment I made a few hours ago, and did a payment I just made go through ok...on the app this is going to take too long. It is better to just call them. Oh, and to save you time trying to find it, the auto pay function is done through mail or fax not on the web or through this app.",3

auto payments set up & although it shows I deposited my check days ago, the

shows I'm overdrafted 6x! This is insane & ridiculous! I called customer 
service & they say they can't do anything at the time, but I can go to the 
bank & maybe they can clear it for me. This defeats the purpose of using 
the app to avoid the long waits at the bank during my lunch hour which is 
my only time available. They also just told me that even in person they can

When it works it's not even good for checking account balances, they sort them as they wish to maximize penalties and withdrawals that should show up immediately are marked as pending. Since they sort everything according to their whims and randomly mark transactions as pending, you'd think you could search for drafts by name, but their search engine is incapable of this simple feat. You can't contact anyone unless you go through the website which doesn't matter because they will not contact you back. If you call them, they will lie to you to get you off the phone. I deposited a check a week ago on an account that was over drafted $180. Somehow, in one week, with nothing else going through, I somehow owe this mafia bank $500! They are the WORST. There is no comparison. You're better off burying your money in the yard like a dog than dealing with the hassles of this bank and their terrible app.",1

Now it has trouble taking images of the check and when it does accept the image it sends an unclear image thus resulting in a return deposit fee.  I spoke to a representative at the mobile banking customer service and was told that the transaction would be totally reversed but said nothing about a return deposit fee.  The rep at mobile customer service i spoke to this morning wouldn't help me and was going to hang up on me even when I asked her for a supervisor.

BBVA,News,medium," The app continues to grow and make improvements. Some people do not believe in giving credit for effort, but I do. They improve the app monthly and purposely work towards a better product for their clients. I have been a user since the beginning and I am pleased with the progress.",5
BBVA,News,medium, I just tried to sign in login first time and it is giving me terms and conditions page as blank and I stuck at this page. There is no button to move forward or accept terms and conditions to use this app. So basically I can't use this app aince I can't go past terms and conditions.,1
BBVA,News,medium,Transfer does not work I loved this app until the update. Now I am unable to make mobile transfers.

You have good things and when you try to improve, BANG...it screws up somehow.",1
BBVA,News,medium," This app is very easy to use, remembers your name and is basic to work with. Gives real time updates on server issues, and is ten times better than have to call the 1800 number for you balance",5
BBVA,News,medium,Pain to deposit checks I've used this app for over a year and always find it frustrating to deposit checks with my mobile device. There's always constant errors when taking pictures and what the app says I acceptable.,2

BBVA,News,medium,Needs bug fix I've tried to look at quick view and it always errors. And entering my correct password once locks out my account. Been sitting on the phone for an hour just to sign into my account.,2
BBVA,News,medium, I hate everything about this app. I can put in my login info perfect and still get locked out of my account. This is the second time in less than a week.,1
BBVA,News,medium, Not as great as BBVA Bancomer (the Mexican BBVA bank app)  sometimes BBVA Compass unlinks your customer id against your account information.  But the look and feel interface is nice.,4

BBVA,News,medium, I haven't had any problems with this app. I check my balance and transfer money around to a couple accounts in the same bank. Works perfectly for me.,5

It will not send the security code to actually start the transfer.  It just tells you to enter the code but there is no where to enter it and it never sent it in the first place.  The first time you use the app it asks you if you want to enable certain things but gives you no option other than to accept.  Then it tells you that you can then go into security setting to turn it all off.  They are requiring you to confirm that you want it turned on but no option to continue without giving them permission.,1
BBVA,News,medium, Every time you update this godforsaken app you lock me out of my own account. Either save my information when you update or make it easier to recover password/ username.,1
BBVA,News,medium," Unreliable.  Inconsistent.   When it decides to work I'm happy with it, but that seems to happen less and less.",2

BBVA,News,medium, So far every option in app is working very well. Love the availability to deposit personal and business checks just by taking pictures of the checks.  The Auto alerts keep my accounts current and gives me a sense of security knowing when deposits and withdrawals are made by instant notification,5
BBVA,News,medium,Best banking app App really easy to get around and great for all banking needs. Recommend this app for compass customers.  And the finger print scanner on the Samsung s7 makes it fast and easily to sign on.,5

BBVA,News,medium,Update Sucks This was fine until the update. Who told you guys to update something that was working perfectly. Improvement is more of a fail.

BBVA,News,medium,"Reduced security? With the previous version, I had to type a username plus a password. I used a username that is not the same as any other username.

It works in that it allows me to check the status of my accounts, pay bills and make mobile deposits.   What this app lacks is any checks and balances for deposits that usually comes with banking and accounting. If I make 5 deposits of the same amount during the month, I cannot from my online statement tell which customer's check was deposited. I can't tell if I have a deposit or an accounts receivable problem. There is not a picture of the check that I took a picture of. When I make the deposit, there is a 6-7 digit number number that is displayed on my phone. I record that number, but BBV Compass never shows that number again. The 800 number and the online support people tell they are working on a solution, but I have been waiting for several months. If I go to the bank for deposit, they make a copy of the check, not for mobile banking.   I consider not having checks and balances on a mobile app a serious problem.",2

BBVA,News,medium, Love it great app. BBVA great bank,5
BBVA,News,medium, Liked the older app better.,3
BBVA,News,medium, I prefer the old version !!!,3
BBVA,News,medium,"So so... Most important part of this app is being able to deposit a check. But when it takes a bad photo (often) and try to retake it will give you an ""I can't read this"" error and you can't go back it has to be restarted. Other than that, fairly useful",4
BBVA,News,medium,"Deposit issues The app is better, but if you have to deposit a check you are out of luck. No matter how you take the picture it will tell you it can't read the check. Just awful.",1
BBVA,News,medium,Love it! This App just keeps getting better and better. The design makes it easier to use. This App is one of the reasons that I cannot imagine leaving BBVA,5
BBVA,News,medium,Like the old one better. The old version was MUCH easier and showed pending vs. posted transactions. Don't like this one at all.,1
BBVA,News,medium,Really preferred previous interface This interface is too clunky. Previous interface perfect.,3
BBVA,News,medium,"Woah! We can make deposits by snapping a pic of our checks!? Cool, app keeping getting better and more convenient",5
BBVA,News,medium, Best one I have.  The alerts saved me from fraudulent charges!,5
BBVA,News,medium,Wonderful! In today's fast paced world this app is amazing. Banking at my fingertips. This app had never let me down.,5
BBVA,News,medium,"Mostly good It still has issues, but it's getting better.",4
BBVA,News,medium,Use it everyday. I use this app daily to monitor the activities of my personal and business accounts. A must have.,5
BBVA,News,medium,Stops Working Constantly shutting down,1
BBVA,News,medium, Took twice as long for check deposit and seemed to have a challenge keeping track of itself. Have uninstalled.,2
BBVA,News,medium,Will not deposit the correct amount Will not deposit the correct amount,1
BBVA,News,medium,Happy camper again Was finally able to configure alerts. Thank you for fixing the issue.,3
BBVA,News,medium,Good stuff Like to see my account without going into the bank,4
BBVA,News,medium,Great App This app kicks butt,5
BBVA,News,medium, Great way to manage my accounts.,4
BBVA,News,medium,"Old one better Really preferred they layout of the old app.  Also, if I forget to logout, the app still thinks it's logged in the next time I use it, and I have to make it crash to reset.",3
BBVA,News,medium,I love this app It always works for me. Been using it for years. I'm shocked at how much it can do. Hurray for the modern age!,5
BBVA,News,medium,Terrible Doesn't work. Old version was much better!,1
BBVA,News,medium,Log in doesn't work. Says check username and password.  It did let me log in once but it said $0.00 and said no info available.,1
BBVA,News,medium, This is AWFUL!!!! I was an employee for 30 years.  This is the worst thing that the bank has done.,1
BBVA,News,medium,BBVA Compass App Response I liked the way that the information was explained in a way that is understood. It should always be a easier way to access my personal bank accounts at the Times I need them. Thanks!!!,5
BBVA,News,medium,Better Cannot configure alerts from the app on galaxy s5. The button to configure doesn't perform any actions,4
BBVA,News,medium, It always forceclose on me,3
BBVA,News,medium,Easy to use. Love this app,5
BBVA,News,medium,"Does what I need it to do easily and no hassle. Transfers are smooth, loads quickly, never had a crash. I wish BBVA would make an app for tablets but not really any issue's on my tablet. Banking at your fingertips what more can I ask for. Can get my balance in under a minute. Think back 10 years, we are truly spoiled these days.",5
BBVA,News,medium,"Not bad, but not sure how it's better than previous One simple feature the new app neglects was the different color for deposit/credit transactions. The view now is all one color. Not as easy to identify money coming in",4
BBVA,News,medium,"Horrible App! This is supposed to be a new updated app and I couldn't even use my username or my password to log into this it!!

Miraculously it FINALLY, let me log it after it made me change my password to what it wanted it to be! Horrible App!!! Stick with the old app if you have it, it's much easier to use and better to look at.",1
BBVA,News,medium," after playing  with this new version, about 20 times, i finally understood how this application works. i am not into business, marketing, real estate, wall street, i am just an individual with modest means. For others maybe it works quiet well and more.",3
BBVA,News,medium,"New but not improved This new version is awful, I actually feel like I took a step backwards. The old app was way better.",1
BBVA,News,medium,Not happy I really liked the old version way more driscriptive all in the same section all deposits and withdrawals and would reflect right away,1
BBVA,News,medium,"Unable to log in. I've tried many times and it said it ""couldn't load data"". Old app works perfectly",1
BBVA,News,medium," Most of the app works fine for me, but I hate the Find Us feature. It simply takes too much time and focus to use it while you are actually on the go.

It simply takes too much time and focus to use it while you are actually on the go. For example, if I try to pull it up now, it takes forever to finish drawing the initial map because it finds ""at least 90 Branches/ATMs in this area."" That's because it includes every Allpoint network ATM, and there's no setting to exclude those. It takes a lot of pinch-to-zoom before I can even find my own location among the 90+ icons. If I switch from map to list view, I can do a search to filter out ATMs by looking for ""branch"" in the description, but that takes many taps to accomplish, and there's no way to make list view the initial view by default. What this app really needs is some shortcuts for Nearest Branch, Nearest ATM, and Nearest BBVA ATM. Save the 90 data points for desktop web site; when I'm on the go, I want to be able to tap once and find the most convenient location ASAP.",3
BBVA,News,medium,"Stinks!! Right off the bat, this app locked me out even tho all info was correctly entered.  Now I am stuck waiting for a callback from 'customer service'.  Who does that to their customers?!",1
BBVA,News,medium,"I am very disappointed. I am very dissatisfied with the app because for the last couple of days I have not been able to access my account because this app won't load. I ended up using the old version to gain access, it is highly frustrating for me.",1
BBVA,News,medium,Better in many ways This update is pretty decent. Make sure to clear your app cache before using it and it should run fine. The layout is different. Better? In some ways yes in some ways no. I like it and it still does exactly what I want it to do.,4
BBVA,News,medium,New App Not impressed. The old one is far better.,3
BBVA,News,medium," What happened to ""Pending"" transactions? I liked that feature on old app.",3
BBVA,News,medium, I in 10 chance  of transaction  going  through.  Lousy  !,2
BBVA,News,medium, No ability to make principal payment = worthless app,1
BBVA,News,medium,Needs another update! It's keeps crashing!,3
BBVA,News,medium,BBVA Compass App The app to have for y'all of your online banking needs!,5
BBVA,News,medium,Wth Just did the update cant even log in!,1
BBVA,News,medium,Ok it works Works just fine now.  Samsung galaxy s5  5.0.0,5
BBVA,News,medium, It helps me out wen I need to know anything,4

BBVA,News,medium,"App misbehaving upon login Log in keeps asking me to verify my username and password after I've put in the correct info.  After deleting the app and reinstalling, same problem.  I literally can't get into this app.  Please fix!  I use this everyday!!",2
BBVA,News,medium,Works great now! Had trouble accessing my information after updating this application so I sent an email and low rating and the app began working immediately. I like the new update now that's it's working correctly. Very easy to maneuver around in.,5
BBVA,News,medium,Login error After numerous attempts to login I have given up. Says to verify username and password but I know that it's correct. Also won't let me enter security question. Should have stayed with Apple iPhone 5S,1
BBVA,News,medium,I thought easy I thought it was going to be easy that a monkey could do it but no it turned out to be bullshit. Please get your passwords and usernames straight so people won't get locked out. YOU SUCK AND THE APP AS WELL. :(   &lt;(,1
BBVA,News,medium,"Grrr It doesn't let me login in n it doesn't recognize my device when I have always used this device.

BBVA,News,medium,Give me back the old app! Crashes...harder to navigate...HATE the new font!!!  I have already opened an account at a new bank...hope their app is better!,2
BBVA,News,medium, The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it won't let me transfer money to a external account. It says I have to use a computer. But other than that I love it,4
BBVA,News,medium,"Can't even use it! I enter the correct information and it tells me ""Please verify username and password"" I can't even reset my password in case I did enter it wrongly because it says ""Security information required"" after entering my account number",1
BBVA,News,medium,"Fix the mobile deposit This feature worked great on the old app. The new version will not read the check even if I take crystal clear pictures, frustrating",1
BBVA,News,medium,Harder to read I don't like this update. It is harder to read with the font style. Everything seems jumbled up. Not happy with it at all.,2
BBVA,News,medium,Deposits It would not let me deposit it to my account only gave me my business account and shows my personal account as a savings account. On top of that tried to deposit at drive up and nether machine could read my State of Alabama check. Flustrating,2

BBVA,News,medium,Crashes It never works. Whenever I try to transfer money an error message pops up.,1
BBVA,News,medium, The update doesn't show you who the transaction is from so now you have to log in at a desktop or laptop,2
BBVA,News,medium,Love it Nicer app. Easier.  My only dislike is that it doesn't separate pending from posted.,4
BBVA,News,medium,"Great app Great app, love the new upgrade",5
BBVA,News,medium, Not good at all,1
BBVA,News,medium,"Not well tested... premature release Subscriber does not exist error, mobile banking error please call number missing... font is huge in account details compared to the old version.. makes scolling more tedious.  Really?!",3

Some things are better: look and feel of UI is better, ""I want to.."" menu is easy, account activity seamless. Viewing a real-time statement is wonderful, as well as history of various transactions. That's where it stops. They want us to use this app, why not make it useable?",1
BBVA,News,medium,The bank is just bad in general/the app always crashed or was down Was charged up too 300$ for a banking error on their half and even after getting them too waive 2 of the fees they gave us another one the next morning anyways. We closed the account and now happily bank with Capitol One.,1
BBVA,News,medium,"Worst bank app ever. 75% of the time mobile transfers fail...but here is the kicker,the app shows that it is successful, but you have to wait about three days to find out that it didnt go through. Total junk.  Try Simple.  They do all the same stuff but no fees. This bank has a fee for everything.",1
BBVA,News,medium," Too many issues to list. Ever since the mandatory update, the app and experience is terrible. Assuming am allowed to login, which is 50/50 at best.   Just have to decide which bank am going to move to. It's that bad.",1
BBVA,News,medium,They stole 76$ overdraft fee from me Refused to refund when I call the branch. And  btw i have signed TO  HAVE  OVERDRAFT FEE PROTECTION PROGRAM WHEN CREATING THE ACCOUNT. But now they are telling me it excludes online purchases!!   Totally unfair! Don't trust this bank! I paid and closed the account...,1
BBVA,News,medium,Uninstalled immediately This app requires my password to be less than 12 characters. It's already bad enough I can't use special characters in my BBVA password. I didn't get past the login screen before uninstalling.,1

BBVA,News,medium, Why couldn't you just update the old app? Kinda feels like there were some security issues they didn't tell us about. Think it may be time to switch banks again...,5

BBVA,News,medium,Why make it worse? Only point of new version is to collect your personal info including contacts. It has less functionality than before. Not worth it.,1
BBVA,News,medium," For those who arent able to accept the terms and conditions download the bbva wallet app. It appears to be the same thing. The only ""problem"" i have with it is that it makes you sign in again whenever you reopen the app. I suppose its for security reasons. Hope this helps(ed)",1

Like ordering before I get to the store and having the food already made thus not having to wait. I assume this because other burger apps do this. This is not the case with five guys.   Thanks to a policy of not making the fries until you are in the store, you have to wait no matter what.  Don't use the app? You're going to wait. Use the app? You're going to wait. While you may wait marginally less time using the app, to me it's splitting hairs.   I really don't see the point of this app thanks the to the ""Fresh fries"" policy. Odd that they would let the burgers loiter in a bag but not the fries.  It is Five Guys Burgers right? Not Five Guys Fries? Oh well off to delete this app.",2

They don't drop the fries until you get there, and in my case I waited 20 minutes longer because they never cooked the fries and just forgot about me. People who technically ordered after me were getting their complete order and leaving. This seems to be a trend with this app. In their defense they did try to make it right by offering free food. Still irritating.",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," The stores have a policy of not making your fries until you arrive, to ensure freshness.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Have to wait to have fries cooked every time, what's the point of app and

can't skip the line???",1

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Horrible app. Order from one location, it goes to a different location, automatically bill your card so you're stuck. Deleted it after one order",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Easy to use. The only thing missing is gift cards on the app.. Give me a gift card qr code or something,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, It's great to order your food but you still need to go to the order window to tell them your here. I waited for 6 orders after my order to get my food. Might as well go to the register first.,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, What happened to being able to pay by app... defeats the whole purpose of ordering ahead of time,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, The app used to be great. Now you have to stand in line to pay instead of paying through the app. Kind of defeats the purpose of using the app.,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Easy to order, saves your favs to reorder. Only change I would make is card should be universal for any 5 Guys.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Great food, flexible ordering, but the app forgets my info every. frackin. time. Too frustrating!!",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, I was hoping it would have promotions or coupons like the McDonald's app but it doesn't. Still convenient to order through the app though,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Easy to use, clear info. Able to quickly order and see my order status. Definitely one of the best restaurant apps.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," First time trying it, got a cheeseburger but the cook forgot both cheese and burger patties, got a new one pretty fast but still wasted time walking back, burgers really good.",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Be ready to pick it up in 8 minutes and you will have no problem. Nothing better than the interface. Simplicity at its finest. A checklist of the menu with the amount.   5 starz for 5 guyz,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Best burgers in our little town! I'm gonna get fat lol :-D,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Best thing I've downloaded got my food instantly after paying just wish you could pay from app as well,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, I love Five Guys burgers & fries the only thing is its a little expensive but if i could i would eat their burgers & fries all the time,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Order again should give you the option to change to location by default or they should at least let you cancel an order that was just placed.,2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Paypal promises to protect my money when shopping online. You promise to grill me a burger. I want to pay with paypal, not trust burger jockeys to store my card info on an app. Give me paypal options please.",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," This app is AMAZING! I have used it twice so far and will continue to us. I would suggest adding an ""instructions"" section to include how you would like something cooked but other than that, this app is great! Thanks! :)",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," The app works well. It doesn't accept Android Pay! I don't like giving my credit card information to apps, especially with so many companies being hacked these days.",2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Good app. Easy to use. Wish could select more pickup times then just every 15 minutes.,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Doesn't provide quicker service. Could have ordered in store, had it, and been on my way. Boooooo",2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, I like it better than before but a check in feature would make it great - like when you're about 5 minutes away. Seamless delivery.,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, A simple order app for convenience...  There is nothing to get wrong.  I have a 5 guys in my neighborhood. this app is awesome i order my food walk to the store and it's hot and ready when I get there.,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Be careful to verify the store it auto picks for you... I was within sight of the store I wanted and it placed the order 3 miles away 😕,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, THANK YOU FOR BEING THE BEST. WE LOVE FIVE GUYS BURGERS AND FRIES IN RALEIGH N.C BY CAPITAL BLVD,5

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Took the time to load this app. Placed my pick up order. Arrived only to WAIT. Why did I bpther?!?!,2

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, The app is very easy to use and navigate. I really like being able to save my favorite orders!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," this used to work great, order while I'm walking to my car at work, have my food 10 minutes later when I arrive at my local five guys. Now the app can't find any location near me at all and it's become totally useless.",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Super responsive app! All app devs should treat this speed as the gold standard.,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Loved this app till it said there was no stores near my location which there obviously is cuz its right down the street....,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, This app is technically the official give guys app (partnered with olo). I had ordered several times and works great!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, They forgot my beacon on my beacon cheeseburger... so I ended up with just a cheeseburger but paid for a beacon cheeseburger.   Too late once you get home!,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Delicious! The same every order, my go to Burger place, never fails.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Five Guys is hands down the best burger and fries.  The staff is always fantastic and it NEVER disappoints!,5

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, We love 5 guys! This app makes it so easy to order to go!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, My food was supposed to be ready at 442pm. It was not ready until 503pm. I had to wait several minutes when I was hoping to walk in and out with my food. I do like the app though.,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Love their shakes! Dip your frys in too! Best fry and shake combo around!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, This app is good but it needs to give an option to pay in person at the store,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Pick up was quick and easy! Great way to skip the line and trap your food,",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, It never saves the payment option I've put in multiple times who h is incredibly annoying but other than that it works fine.,2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Good app, needs a way to input comments/instructions (like ""don't wait to make fries till I arrive"")",4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," I like using the app, but it never saves my cc Info even though I select to save on file every time.",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Fantastic  no more waiting in line to order, then again to get your food",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," This is a great app, it would be better if I could update my credit card in my profile, rather than at the point of ordering.",4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Poor communication between the app and the restaurant....,2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Pointless app no faster then going in.....,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, There is no way to cancel or edit an order once its sent.,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, They really need to add some way to request condiments on the side. Other than that this would be a five star app,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Easy peasy to use. Nice they are trying to speed service up,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Great app but it needs a no salt option for French fries.,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Gift cards are a pain to use on the app,4

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Easy fast and simple app I had some issue at the beginning  found was my wi-fi interfiere with, turn it off and fast  and easy to place  an order. Never used another app for fast food this one works. Only one thing! Will be better  if they explain what is Cajun fries or regular fries. It will help to know what to order",4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, On app does not store credit card info correct. It erases the 0 from the front of #'s and won't process. Liked better before new update. If it won't work it's completely worthless!! way to go five guys stop people from ordering on your app,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, The app itself is great. Its easy to use and convenient. Maybe it's just my location but when I go to pick up my order I always have to wait like 15 extra min. That is a lot when your trying to make it on your lunch break.,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Made order on app money charged to my bank account. Drove to the location. They didn't get the order. Even with proof they would give my refund or food. Horrible service.,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Burger and much more If you haven't tried 5 guys... You're missing out!!! It's incredibly easy to negotiate and order from their site or the app! Fast food @ five stars!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Lives up to the name, now This used to be a clumsy app.  After the recent update, it's a real pleasure to use.  I love Five Guys, and now I love the app -- makes me want to eat more burgers.",5

I uninstalled the app, re-installed it and tried again, received the same error 3 times.  So 6 times I tried to place my $21.72 order.  Now (4 days later) there is a $130.32 hold on my account for 6 pending orders.  This is causing all kinds of problems now, and should not have happened.  There is not even anyone I can call to try and sort this out!  I will NEVER USE THIS APP again!!",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Love the food,  love the app! Such a time saver! It couldn't be easier.  The only thing I would like to do is be able to add the tip.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," I love this app, just wish there was an option to notify the restaurant you've arrived. Waiting behind 5+ people in line to verify you've arrived is painful.",4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Disappointed in the new app. Doesn't allow plan ahead ordering. When you order you better be within 8 minutes of the store. It doesn't allow for later planned pick-up .,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Can't pay with Card? Used to be able to, but with the latest update it doesn't seem to let you pay with your card... At least this was the case for me. There's no option anywhere... Other than that the app has always been great, but they need to add card payment again asap.",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Didn't give me a payment option... I placed a large order for coworkers and myself... Every one had their own cards so I had to eat the bill and collect cash... A cash on pick up option would be awesome...,3

Always nice and personable! One tweak for the app would be to set zip code so you don't have to enter it each time. Also the option to pay in the store would be appreciated. Sometimes someone other than me wants to pay but not have to enter their credit card number in my app and doesn't want to install the app on their phone.,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, This app is the only way I order my food any more.  When I arrive I can take it to go or eat there.  LOVE THIS APP!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Update to the app sucks App worked fine before and you broke it. Said I placed the order but the store didn't get it. Get it together or lose my business.,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Obviously the burgers and fries (particularly the amount of them!!) can't be beat. I find the app easy to use. I think they just added the ability to re-order previous orders, which I like because we're creatures of habit. No complaints with the app.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"This app really improved, but.. This app improved with the latest upgrade but still lacks some important information such as indicating which are the ""all the way ingredients"".",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Waited 15 min once I got to restaurant for my order because the app did not tell me I needed to let restaurant know I was there to begin fixing my fries. App is pointless if I still have to wait for my food once I arrive.,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Highly recommended I wish every app work as well as this one! I am a customer of Five Guys and usually order online at home. Was out doing errands, and downloaded the app. Once I signed in it already had all my favorites and information. Made a few adjustments and submitted. No complaints",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Problem I really like the new design, very clean and organized. Awesome food too",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Fast download. Extremely easy to navigate and order. Log into your account if you've ordered online before, and it will show your order history, and you can re order your faves. They even call to confirm your order once you place it so make sure your number is out in correctly lol",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Two times in a row I asked for extra cheese and didn't receive it. Clerk behind desk never spoke but expected me to speak and seemed annoyed to be helping me. 530pm 1/23/17 foreign person,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," I ordered online and it promised that my order would be ready in 10 mins, I show up to pick it up and turns out that they didn't get my online order yet and I had to give the details in writing to the cashier 😒. I wasn't going to pay again for sure.",2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, I open the app and tells me there is no locations near me.um we eat there all the time. I go to map and I see no five guys. So this app is useless if I can't even get it to know where it's locations are.,2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, App is great. Food not ready when I got here...still standing around waiting :(,5

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, I would give a 5 but hate that they don't start the fries till you show up? So WHY order on their app a head of time?,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Said my order would be ready in 8 minutes. I get there 25 minutes after I placed order and still had to wait 10 minutes. What's the point of ordering ahead of time to pick up if it's going to take 35 minutes to get. This was supposed to make my wait time shorter.,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, It's just a easy way top order no coupon codes or good deals for having the app underlying pointless,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Order sent through garbage to the restaurant so it wasn't ready. They could run it once I got there, but defeated the purpose of the app.",2

After I ordered, the app did that the food would be ready in 9 minutes and I was 15 minutes away. When I got to the restaurant, I waited for my order to be called. After the rest of my party of 6 people went through the line and got their food, I went to the order counter, asked about my order, they printed a receipt with an order number and that's when they started making my burgers. So, even though I had ordered and paid 15 minutes before everyone that showed up 20 minutes later, my order wasn't placed until I went to the line. Ridiculous.",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Since the  new updates the app no longer allows you to pay online with card would  like the option to pay online. Food is great now improve the app.,2

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Good update but needs continued refinement I like this workflow, but I feel the smaller font without the icons makes it harder for the list selection. Also it would be nice to be able to ask for toppings on the side.",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Please add 2FA so I can leave my credit card info tied to my account. Either that or give is options to pay with PayPal or AndroidPay. I will not leave credit card info in accounts that have no 2 factor authentication.,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Nice & simple app to order great burgers & fries! I only wish I could order no-salt fries. There is no comment field for the fries. If you like to eat around noon, you need this app to beat the line.",4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," One thing that the app is missing, is  a rewards program.  Like BurgerFi",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," The only option for payment is to enter in my credit card info, including cvv? Um, no thanks. Let me know when I can use Android pay or Visa pay.",2

The hamburgers ended up being ready 15 minutes after ordering and they would not give me the fries in the order until 30 minutes after I ordered it. People who came in after me and waited in the line got their food before me. It took 30 minutes to get my food and the burgers where cold but the app said the order was completed 8 minutes after I placed it which was not true. Another negitive point is the app doesn't tell them when you arrive like other chain fast food places apps. Basically the app leads to longer waits and cold food.,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Why doesn't it accept gift cards or pay cash option? That would make this app better if I could pay with something other than a credit card.,2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Great app Galaxy S7 Easy to use and straight to the point. Would be nice if they had a field for special prep instructions, but I can understand why they dont.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Clingy storing credit cards. Is red yes or is gray yes? Why not use green and red?,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, This app is super easy to use. I love that you can save orders incase you are craving something different or want to easily load up your favorite combo.,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, This doesn't select the nearest store for you and i ordered from store that is 25 minutes from where I was and there was no option to cancel even right after you submit. Had to drive almost an hour to get a hamburger,2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,I love the butgers These burgers are better than gf but donut tell her I said that! LoL,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, They as far as I know of have the best burgers recommend going there to eat and the App allows you to place an order while you sit at your table.,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Really nice app The old app was serviceable, but this update is awesome.   The folks at the counter are great.  The app makes it too easy.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Simple application to order Five Guys food. You can save orders and payment info. Wish there was a comment section when you place an order to give specific instructions.,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,The new version is pure garbage Bring back the previous version!,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Great..til the update It used to be great, but now the menu is super tiny. Hoping it will go back to the original or an improved format",4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Simple, with well chosen defaults, and a very well thought out layout. Usually all quantities are always arranged from least to greatest. This app does it differently and for the better.",5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Yum! Sooooooooo convenient for that favorite burger run. Enter order. Drive. Pick up order. Eat. Repeat!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, Love being able to quickly order my food using the the save order function. All I have to do is press a couple of buttons and I'm all set.,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium, What's the point? The store will not begin making your order until you arrive there so why bother spending any time on this app?,1

Just go to the restaurant, go past the line to the cashier, tell him or her you placed a ""Web order,"" and they know immediately.

Just one issue though: If you need to update or change your credit card (payment method), you first have to go to fiveguys,com, sign in (there's nothing that says ""sign in,"" but you will find that option under ""Sign Up""). From your account page, remove y our credit card. There is no way to add a new one in, or to edit existing card info, i.e. update expiration date.

Why would this app need these permissions:     read/modify/delete the contents of your USB storage     access Bluetooth settings/pair with Bluetooth devices     set an alarm     view Wi-Fi connections/view network connections/connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi     prevent device from sleeping The previous version (2.3.2.412041556) had only 4 permissions, all of which made perfect sense for locating a Five Guys and placing an order. It is in very poor taste that Five Guys thought their user base didn't deserve an explanation for why they suddenly needed such unrestricted access to our devices & information. At the time of this review, the only explanation provided (if you could call it that) was: ""Support for new in-restaurant technologies"". I can't imagine that, at no point during the development & testing of these new features, not one employee thought an exponential increase in required permissions warranted any explanation beyond 5 words. I'm very disappointed Five Guys.",2

However, I wish you didn't have to enter a credit card in order to order online, I wish it would allow cash pick ups.  Especially since sometimes I have cash on me and don't feel like charging anything.  Also, when I save an order as a favorite, next time I'm in the app I can't actually access favorites.  Will give 5 stars when this is something that can be done.",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Saved orders While the app tells you you can save an order to quickly reorder it later there is no way to actually do so.  You can look at your past orders total cost but not simply reorder it.  Please get this feature working as we almost always order the exact same thing every time.,4
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Better to order online I set up an order on this app and asked that it be ready 45 mins later for pick up.

When I arrived to the restaurant, and let them know I was there, they informed me that not only had the ticket not printed on their end until my arrival, but that the app had also changed my ready time to 40 mins passed my requested time. They said they run Ingo this all the time, and recommend ordering from their website (at least until the app is better).  So we got to stand around and wait for our entire order to be made.",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"No explanation for 'All the way' One of the topping options is 'All the way' but no explanation to what is included. Plus for the veggie it automatically generated some toppings for me. So when I selected all the way and didn't delete the toppings it auto-filled, they didn't make my order so I still had to wait!",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Simple App for A Simple &Delicious Burger It's easy to use, but I'm not a person who has the need to special order a burger.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Easy ordering, no cash option The app works really great (Galaxy S4) and ordering was fairly intuitive.  The app did a good job of detecting my closest restaurant.    My only real complaint is that I want to have the option of paying cash when I get to the store.  -1 star for that missing feature.",4

Nope.  For the first several times I started up the app, it would crash with a server certificate problem. After finally getting past that,  it had trouble locating a restaurant in my area. Finally, it would crash and force close every time I tried to add something to my bag. By the time I gave up and uninstalled it, I would have spent far less time by just driving to the restaurant and ordering at the counter in the first place. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Uninstalled.",1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Pay with cash! I would give this app 5 stars if you had the option to pay with cash when you pick up... Otherwise.. I hate it.,1

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Takes the hardest part of ordering out of the equation! Love this app. I can make sure I don't leave anything off my favorite burger!,5
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Only downfall - requires you to add CC info before order is placed. Other apps allow for pay at pickup. Its not that I don't trust FG with my card #, but I sure don't trust the app market with it.",1

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"3 Nicely designed, but a cash option (since we have to come pick it up anyway) would be nice. I don't want my credit card number locked in you data base.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Can't provide instructions/requests Just tried using the app. I didn't notice an option to request certain condiments on the side. Next time I'll look into ordering by phone.  I love this place though and sometimes I'm craving it enough to make the wait worthwhile.,3

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Update for plain orders Doesn't allow for plain orders. I get to the restaurant and they say my order is incomplete because I didn't add toppings. I don't want toppings.,3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,Awesome! Just when you though Five Guys burgers couldn't get any better...BAM! This app comes along!,5

It transmits to and from the server with EVERYTHING you do (and freezes while it does so), such as getting a list of toppings everytime you try to order an item.  This ends up taking so long that you might as well just go there and order in person and wait.  The smart thing to do would be to put all toppings in a single file and transmit it once when the app starts.  Then, when you complete your order, transmit it ONCE to the server instead of continuously ad hoc.  I only gave it two stars because it actually works...eventually.",2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,This App is a scam!!!!! Every Time you order using this APP you get a charge 0f $1.00 for your trouble. It makes a hell of a lot more sense to call and place the order. I am very unhappy that I wasn't made aware that I was going to be charged for using the APP each time.,1
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Somewhat rocky experience I submitted an order for immediate pickup and arrived at the restaurant about 20 minutes later. They hadn't even begun making my order, so I ended up waiting about three minutes to flag down an employee, then another six or seven waiting for my food to be made.",3

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,"Missing a few key things... This app is missing 2 key things. 1. The ability to call up saved orders (you can call them up online when you're signed in, but not on the app) and 2. The ability to modify toppings (lite, regular, extra) as you can on the website. For now, I'll stick to their mobile we page.",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium," Should add a skip gps ability at the start of app. Also, didnt have the five guys I was looking for making this useless.",3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Utilities,medium,The app is not the problem. The crappy rating is because of crappy Five Guys policy where they won't make your fries until after you arrive to pick up your order.,1

FoodKick,Utilities,low," After you place your order, they imediately place a hold for the full amount for everything you ordered, and state that it's all on the way. However what you receive is somewhat random, based on what actually happens to be in their warehouse. Don't count on receiving a fill list for a recipe.",1
FoodKick,Utilities,low, I keep getting a pop-up box telling me about produce freshness rating. Once was enough. It popped up literally 20 times the last time I shopped. Think this is a bug on Android app. I just switched from iPhone and never had this issue on old phone.,2
FoodKick,Utilities,low, Love the service but the app is really bad. Why do I need to log in and enter my address every time I use it? I usually end up opening a Chrome tab on my phone because it's a lot faster.,3

FoodKick,Utilities,low, 90% of time the app loads without and items.,2
FoodKick,Utilities,low, I don't like that you can't see the discount after a promo code is applied. You can only put the promo code in the box then submit your order without knowing whether the discount works. This needs to change then I would give the app a better rating,1
FoodKick,Utilities,low," Current  app won't let me select a delivery time, so can finish the order",1
FoodKick,Utilities,low, This app is just a glorified website. You're probably better off using their real mobile site.,2

FoodKick,Utilities,low," It's great when it works, but that's not often enough. Half the time I open it, no foods show up so I can't order.",3
FoodKick,Utilities,low," All of the delivery slots are always filled up, so it really doesn't get to you until 4-5 hours after you order it. What's the point of this app if you have to wait so long...?",1
FoodKick,Utilities,low,Nice service but the app is buggy I like Foodkick due to its convenience and selection. The app however has a nasty bug. If the app is minimized and reopened it signs you out. I have to exit and reopen the app to sign in again. It's annoying especially when you are switching between apps.,3
FoodKick,Utilities,low," Avoid this service. We used FoodKick several times and they never once got our order correct. At least one item was missing every time, which is a real bummer to discover when you're in the middle of a recipe.",1
FoodKick,Utilities,low,"Very handy Delivery is spot on, delivery attendants are on time and courteous. Filtering in the app itself could be improved, but I really enjoy the convenience.",5
FoodKick,Utilities,low,"Has improved a lot, but needs a bit more ux Quick chat feature is great and can resolve most questions. Filtering could still be a bit smarter to help you find products quickly. A little unclear on how much meat /cheese you're buying from the counter/deli. Food delivery is a bit slow, but quality so good.",3
FoodKick,Utilities,low,Useless I tried to search for gluten free options and only got packaged food. I found some prepared meals that looked interesting but there was no allergen or ingredient information. I tried chatting with the support staff and they were very helpful but the app crashed twice while using the chat. I give up.,1

May want to check into this as my phone is warning that it's draining my battery slowly. ______  This app is fantastic. I use this to show coworkers what a proper ordering app should be. My only request is that the developers put pick-up times in 5 or 10 minute intervals rather than 15 because it can make the difference with the in-store set up.,4

FreshDirect,Utilities,low,Didn't Work for me 😕 The app kept running on my Samsung Galaxy S5 acting as if it was installing but after about 3 minutes I gave up.  I'll see if the website will be a better option.  Good Luck.✌,1
FreshDirect,Utilities,low,"Pretty embarassing This app barely works.  Lack of tablet support is inexcusable.  All this is exasperated by the fact that their site is nearly unusable in the 3 major android browsers.  Pretty pisspoor considering there business model of convenient, premium food sold ON THE INTERNET.",1
FreshDirect,Utilities,low,"Need to open up app to tablets too! Easy to use app. Fast and simple. Makes it easy to order from previous orders as well. Works well on Samsung Epic 4g, but not compatible with the galaxy tab... c'mon!",4

FreshDirect,Utilities,low,Can't reduce quantity App doesn't allow me to reduce quantity to 0 of a previously ordered item. Very annoying. Otherwise UI pretty good.,3

Goodcents,Utilities,low, Always easy to navigate. Given the current circumstance it's a life saver for our house being able to order meat and bread. It's far cheaper and better quality. Thanks!,5

Goodcents,Utilities,low," Will NOT use the new app. They are using a company that sells your info. No thanks. Sorry goodcents, you lost a loyal customer.

Goodcents,Utilities,low, No way to find rewards in the new app. Made me reset my password. Horrible migration and trash app. Uninstalling as this is useless now for me.,1
Goodcents,Utilities,low," It's pretty good. It does what you'd expect. I'd really like the option to select ""lite"" or ""easy"" on things like condiments. Another area for improvement is including real-time delivery alerts.",4
Goodcents,Utilities,low, Makes you look in to different web based app. Down not make sense. Old app much better.,1
Goodcents,Utilities,low, Keeps telling me to update the app and get the latest version but goes straight to the one I already have.,1

Goodcents,Utilities,low, The app keeps saying it's out of date but there are no updates in the Google Play Store.,1
Goodcents,Utilities,low, Works well for ordering but could use some work as far as accuracy of what's available at each location and convenience when it comes to getting points for what you've ordered. You should be able to scan your receipts to get points as well.,3
Goodcents,Utilities,low, The app was fine except when you went to put in special request every time you hit the button and it kept pushing you out and wouldn't let you make any special requests. It did let you do it at the end but not where you wanted to for each item.,4

Goodcents,Utilities,low, The app is nice and easy to navigate. Need to have other options listed (with prices) when adding other ingredients.,4
Goodcents,Utilities,low, Took awhile to figure out how to delete an item in the cart. It took a process of trying different things as there was no where that it explained how to do it....you had to press down and hold on items to delete.,3
Goodcents,Utilities,low," The app is pretty good, the biggest issue is the lack of customization allowed when building your sandwhich if they fixed this it would be the best sandwich phone app.",4

Goodcents,Utilities,low," Every since the last upgrade, I can't get in to order. It is a worthless app now. Go back to what you had. Until then, I'll go elsewhere.",1
Goodcents,Utilities,low," Very simple to use. Only complaint would be this...the store I order from has Mrs.Vickys Salt & Vinegar chips, but it's not an option to select when placing an order, so I alwyas have to remember to add a note when I order.",5
Goodcents,Utilities,low, The app works great after you get the initial set up completed. Save your favorite sandwich for easy ordering on the go.,5
Goodcents,Utilities,low," Claims that it delivers to my entire town. When the delivery option is chosen, it says i am outside of the delivery zone. I'm in the middle of town so there's a glitch for sure. Bummer, goodcents is so good!",1

yourself (already charged a delivery fee) or wait for a refund. If they 
cant deliver, take the option away before we submit the order or notify us 
before we spend our money.",3

have to reverse through your previous sandwich to add more than one is 
annoying.",3

Goodcents,Utilities,low, Needs a better way back to add additional items. Once you add an item the only way back is to click back repeatedly. Needs a back to menu or continue ordering etc.,4
Goodcents,Utilities,low, App is very easy to use. Have had no trouble with it. Love the subs!,4

There were minor issues - like it insisted that I enter my birthday but only offered 6 months to choose from!?? Weird. The reason I deducted a star from this otherwise perfect experience was due to the delivery time option. I was so happy to see that I could select the time for my order to be delivered (so it would arrive right before my company). However, my delivery arrived 25 minutes before my selected time - leading me to believe that they didn't even notice the order had a later delivery time. On the receipt - the requested delivery time was in HUGE bold print! If they are going to offer this option, they need to provide it. Otherwise, seriously great app and service!",4

Goodcents,Utilities,low,"With some help It could be better. Such as adding the ability to add an additional drink and chip to the order. Possibly using a credit card to pay for the purchase. That's the only thing Jimmy John's has on you, although their sammiches suck.",3
Goodcents,Utilities,low,"Not an intuitive app Watch the pickup or delivery option. Didn't see that mine was placed for pickup till it was placed, even though I swear I chose delivery. Hard to figure out how to delete items from cart, too. Not a fan of the app yet.",2
Goodcents,Utilities,low," Very buggy. Randomly selected a date in the future (even though there is no option to pick a date besides today), has random error messages like ""Authentication Error"" even though I never put anything in and nothing was wrong",1
Goodcents,Utilities,low," It let us order food for delivery at 3:30, but the store doesn't start delivering until 5.  We didn't know that until the store called us half an hour after we ordered.",1
Goodcents,Utilities,low, I know I live in the delivery area because I order from Goodcents often but the app tells me otherwise. Useless.,1
Goodcents,Utilities,low,"So far so good! I've only placed one order through the app, but it was just as easy as going online!",5
Goodcents,Utilities,low,DO NOT DOWNLOAD App constantly crashes and tries to take your whole phone with it. Awful app!,1

Goodcents,Utilities,low,"Good but... It would be nice if I can save multiple cards, but other than that easy to use and accurate delivery times",4
Goodcents,Utilities,low,Easy to use app The ordering process was simple. I'd like to see an order history that I can reorder from in a future update. Otherwise it's a great app.,5
Goodcents,Utilities,low,Hm. Should be some kind of incentive for ordering through the app. Like coupons released every once in a while to make you want to order goodcents.,3

The app originally was pretty good and I could see it becoming great in the CRM field, but they took some wrong turns. First, how does a CRM app not allow the use of the word appointment anywhere? An appointment is the basic unit of sales. All of the previous CRM's I used allowed you to easily schedule an appointment and call it an appointment. It causes a lot of confusion, an event could be a lot of things. Next, they had custom fields you could make and use, but in an update they did away with them and you lost all data you entered into them. And speaking of losing data, as far as I can tell there is no way you can back up your data and keep it safe yourself. Now they have updated the software and it is incompatible with my device. How nice. Once again they have took away features, in this case the ability to use it. They have some things working for them, but it looks like some competitor has infiltrated their business and is sinking them (no I am not serious, but they couldn't do much better if they were) This company desperately needs to communicate with some traditional salespeople and listen...",2

When importing contacts search for specific contacts will be imported instead of having to scroll through an entire list. When doing a mass Imports a lot of the organization's I had attached to my contacts didn't come through. Import the contacts one at a time the companies they work for show up. If I make an update to my contacts in my address book and then we imported in, the contact duplicates instead of updates. Something in the system that could recognize duplicates, or ask to merge certain contacts would be ideal. In fact I'd rather keep my contact list on the phone I have it sync rahter having to push it up each time. The same thing with Google Calendar, I would like to keep my events on the Google side but be able to add events from the app or the website be able to see the calendar through it.

I'm not using it for sales, I'm using it to keep track of inspections and I don't need a full blown, complicated CRM so I like the simple, uncluttered interface.

I obviously use the website on my laptop, but I have the apps on my Samsung Note 8.0 and my Google Nexus 5.  The free flow of data from one to the other is seamless, and the interface is straightforward and easy to figure out among the three versions of the platform.  My big gripe is that the apps lack a great deal of functionality that are offered by the desktop version.  A more complete mobile package would be great.  One feature I would love to see added would be that when I tap to email a contact from within the app, it should give me the option of which email app to send from (I prefer the GMail app, but the Samsung Email app is defaulted on my tablet.)    Also, when sending an email straight from the contact, it would be a boon if the email address that I'm supposed to CC if I want to attach that email to the contact were already populated.",4
Insightly CRM,News,low,Awesome CRM App! I can't believe some of the other reviews. Complaining about not having automatic refresh. I'm sorry that you have to work a little by pressing a button. This app is free and is by far better than most CRM's. Thank you for the great software.,5

I was placing an order to pick up at the drive-thru. My last item was for hot chocolate. I only asked that I have whipped cream placed on the hot chocolate. After selecting whipped cream I scrolled to the bottom of the screen, put my name in the place where it was supposed to be, and clicked on add to basket. I was then asked to select my milk in the select milk section. The problem is there is no select milk section. Therefore, I could not order my hot chocolate because of this issue. Would you please fix this. I called the restaurant and let them know about this issue. At least I will get my hot chocolate today. Unfortunately my husband will have to order & pay for it separately when he goes to pick up our order at the drive-thru.",4

Microsoft Azure,News,low, App is good for quick look at the status of your apps. But search and filter functionality needs to added at every level for now filter is only given to Resource Group level. Better use it on WiFi If you have lots of apps then it eats your data brutally.,3

If you're interested in the big topics of the day, you're pretty well covered here. If you're more interested in niche stuff, it is not always so consistent.

I switched to the Xbox one interest, which worked for a few days before also getting stuck on articles. When I tested the Xbox interest again, which I had entirely removed, I was getting the same articles that it had been stuck on from a month ago.

This is the closest I've found with regards to the news function. It's fast, responsive, has a good selection of news feeds (daily mail readers probably won't like their selection) and supports the concept of a local news feed as well. I have only given 4 stars because their news feed widget only displays the top news item without allowing you to move onto the next one, it also wastes space saying it's a Microsoft news feed. There are also placed articles in the news feed rather than ads that popup (so not too bad) but I would pay for ad free.

Microsoft News,News,medium, Generally the layout is good. There is too much old news that is kept on for weeks. The articals are usually extremely bias. We want the news facts - not some idiots oppinion. We are quite capable of forming our own oppinions thankyou. Please fix this.,2

My father passed away a few months ago and I did use my android phone to search when arranging his funeral. Since then I have had deeply insensitive adverts on this app about funeral and cremation. I literally get these ads every time I use the app. There seems to be no way of deleting cookies or setting ads to not use my personal information. I've even deleted and downloaded the app. Please answer why you think this is ok?,1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Easy to use. Good to spend time and keep yourself updated on news. I feel a certain bias in the news selection so make sure you have more than one source. ( Should always be the case anyway. ) Thus why I took away one star. Otherwise, great app.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," unstable and unreliable. frequently stops. too bad, it was good for a while.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," I want to give 5 stars but,... I love the app except for 1 issue.

Microsoft News,News,medium," Very easy to use! The main reason why this is my favorite News app is because you get all news in one place, no need to download other apps or go to their websites.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Good sources and good layout, but every other time I open it the entire interface becomes jumbled and unreadable. I'll keep using the app but it gets annoying to have to open it twice almost every time I want to read something.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," I appreciate the text only mode. The interface is easy to understand and navigate. However, the story categories seem to be cluttered with content that is not relevant to my needs or interest choices.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Good news curating app. My one complaint is that it does not support copying portions of viewed content. I presume that is some valid reason for this but it is still a feature that I miss.,4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Mostly a descent app but I really hate that if you disable notifications they continue to show up like you did not disable them. Classic Microsoft move to just disregard the user. One of these days I'll just delete the app n just use Google News app which is sad coz I've been using your app for long,1

Balance on topics can be found again from a variety of top quality news organizations...national and global. The organization of different news types is also exceptional.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Great news resource compilation service. I especially enjoy the syncing with the News app on Windows 10. Great way to curate the news sources you want to read from, although I prefer the Top News tab to keep a more balanced approach. Never have a problem!",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Easy to navigate,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, No better news App than this... Just the way it should be...!,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, The video playback lags on my phone. I have samsung j 7 prime,3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Far too many ""sponcered"" stories. The app seemed to be very nicely laid out but the ""sponcered stories"" aka fake news, click bait, and ads sneakily embedded within the legitimate news feeds just got to be too much for me to handle.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium, This used to be good. And it still is. However it no longer allows me to get a global feed of my area. The location function simply fails to fire.,2
Microsoft News,News,medium, This app is very aesthetically pleasing and keep stories Relevant and up to date. I don't have any problems except the lack of an offline mode. Four Stars,4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Very nice. To me though (or to any other Microsoft launcher user with the same news feed build-in) it's ultimately usless... unless you want to read your world news (can choose 'international' as a region) or to have a dark UI, that's only available in the app so far.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Great news app. Informative and good features. You can added categories liked entertainment, technology, sports, world news and more. Would recommend it. Thanks.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," This app has developed a fault for me recently, every time you click on a news article and then try and go back, the Microsoft News app resets and loads back up so you lose where you were. It's infuriating!!! Hoping for a fix soon before I look elsewhere for my news..",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," My problem with this app and Microsoft generally is localization. I don't know why it's difficult for you to add local content to this news app, you have an office here in Nigeria, but there's never news from here.

Microsoft News,News,medium," Great app. You get all of the current news from all the reputable news channels such as, the New York Times, AP, Washington Post, Fox news etc. Plus it gives you notifications when their is breaking news. All for free",5

I have this Microsoft news on my HP laptop. I watch there, also. But I use my phones more often than my computers, except when writing. Every time I look at MicroSnews, I come away with facts I can trust & Movie info (loved movies since toddler). Microsoft News is my favourite. I use Google news; it's located on Google page. Both MicroS & Google (news) are my #1s, in tandem, like troika. My HDTV is permanently on NHK, but I watch TYT & Randy Rainbow on YouTube.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," I like this app. It's simply a digest of generally available news items, but I like the way you can swipe from one article to the next. It is a bit US orientated, but I can cope with that. I thinks it's one of the best news apps around.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," It's probably been my favorite app besides Google News and Flipboard. These two do offer more topics to follow but Microsoft News is up there. Microsoft if you're listening, you could diversify your news sources more to include right or conservative views...",4

Microsoft News,News,medium, Excellent news and very fast.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Broad detailed coverage of wide variety of topics.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, horrible because you cannot control the content in any way apart from gross categories (sport or news) content aggregators (such as Daily Mail) are promoted over original sources which is poor form. uninstalled it and went back to Google News.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium," fantastic information app, but you have restricted copy paste option, 1. it would be much better if you keep content page without loader option. Because it's getting confused when we scroll the news down. 2. There is no technology page option in the menu tiles.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Your app doesn't refresh news periodically, nor are new news available when refreshed manually. So about 90% of news are stuck for days. It drains away the charm of reading news everyday. I am uninstalling the app.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Worst news app ever! It's better on Windows 10 than on Android. Notifications are not expandable, data layout is so odd. Even the font used is ugly facing. Learn from Google News or Apple News, u r too far from their apps.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Occasionally slow to load and the ads are mixed with regular news articles which can get confusing thus only 4 stars. I use this almost every day to stay informed, and I still think it's the best news app available.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Enjoying the pre-defined categories as well as being able to create my own. Like that there's a Windows 10 version that works with the same categories, so I can follow the news I think important throughout the day.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," I enjoyed the alerts that keep me on top of what's happening in the moment, but sometimes feel the content delivered doesn't always hit the mark with my interests. But, that is the news after all right?",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, I like it because it is on top of the news. It allows opinions from the national papers such as the NYTimes the Washington Post and others to comment. That is what is what I like and the political comics 🤸🏿‍♀️,4
Microsoft News,News,medium," I missed this app when my company moved away from Windows phones and back to Android. The Android version seemed less well laid out IMO but with the new compact view, it feels like the app I used on my old Nokia(s).",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Used to work, but the last update killed the app on my Galaxy S7. Uninstalled and reinstalled, but the app doesn't open- just sits there with the splash screen cycling through the languages. Needs a fix ASAP!",3
Microsoft News,News,medium, The app has a major flaw in that one cannot return to position in string of stories After reading one story. Hitting or selecting 'back on a tablet takes one back to forest story. It does have built in return but users habits are to use device return.,2
Microsoft News,News,medium," Overall, it's a great app. The only thing that's a little frustrating is that the stories you may see on a computer are not the same stories that come up when you open the app (even immediately). Fix this and I'd give it 5 stars!",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, App keeps up with the latest in whatever interests someone. Choosing through an array of categories allowed me to customize the content I want to keep up on. I only wish the app offered the ability to comment on articles.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Best app. We enjoying & following this apps,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Cute animated splash screen. Never loaded any content. I uninstalled, reinstalled, no change. So, the News is, use a different aggregater for your news. This one is without merit",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," App is buggy & finicky, Content is close to pathetic; a mix of news feeds from sites with paywalls (inaccessible) and clickbait masquerading as ""news"". Legitimate stories can for days without refresh, and other real/vital news never gets picked up by MS News.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," Slick app ruined by far too much 'sponsored' content and limited range of sources with no way to add new sources or filter what I'm presented. Like Google News and Apple News, they show you what they want you see and nothing more. Disappointed.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, Much improved after the recent updates. News aggregation is all about choosing the right sources and Microsoft News is doing that now. It would be ideal if it also allowed subscription to magazines or newspapers from the same app.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," In the new advent it looks like leader as it includes almost every topics of one's interest and also provision for Local news ,smoothly! But one thing, don't think I, necessary to keep the old news for days.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Too many of the same report under different categories. You might find one or two new stories mixed in. Seems reports are recycled appearing between current reports. No new reports on Saturday and Sunday as if the app takes the weekend off,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, awesome app. after using for 3 days I can say I am extremely satisfied. also the app doesn't show annoying ad pop-ups like other news app. it shows the advertisement as a card. great.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," I've been using MN for several months now without any major issues and really enjoy it. I have 8 categories/tabs that interest me yet everytime i exit the app, ''Tomorrow's Cars'' adds itself back as the 9th category no matter how many times i manually remove it from the list...",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Nice News alerts lately, and very much when on the go.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Good App. I like it because I can tailor what I want to see and what I'm interested in. As with any news app nowadays you have to take some of the articles with a grain of salt and make your on decisions. Overall great!,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Great for getting first hand up to date information about the happenings around the world!,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," No Bulgarian localisation, and no option for custom news feed. How difficult is to update the source?",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, The app is nice and useful but it has less political news Wish more politics news would be there.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Didn't work on OnePlus 7t pro. It crashes and makes my phone unusable every time I try and open the app.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, I love Microsoft news on a daily basis.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Very very entertaining.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Probably not exactly ""fair and balanced"" when it comes to news... leans to the left pretty far. I find it odd when I go to an alternate news sight and can't even find the story MSN has in the headlines. Lots of bashing President Trump... most of which is not even newsworthy!",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," When the app first opens up, it asks you for your interests. I purposely left Sports and celebrity news unchecked, because I am not interested in that. However, strolling through my feet, news about sports and celebrities still came up. So what the heck is the point? I uninstalled the app.",1

Microsoft News,News,medium," You get a wide variety of news on many different topics quickly. It keeps me more updated with whats going on in more areas from sports to weather to entertainment to government, very helpful.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, I read daily MS News.News from all sources should be given. News from NDTV sources seems pretty biased towards some agenda.,3

Microsoft News,News,medium, Great news aggregator with a dark theme and smooth UI. My only complaint is that you can't select/copy text from the articles.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Partisan mainstream media sources. Getting ""loading"" notifications randomly since the last couple updates.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," When I open this app, screen remains blank. Doesn't load anything. It's my favourite news app on desktop, so on mobile. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, Super slow to load and poorly updating articles for business news. Preferred the old app interfaces..too much gossip and celeb news. Does appear to do stock and graphs as the old one did,2
Microsoft News,News,medium," I have abandoned printed news, as well as TV newscast. The news on Microsoft News app is comprehensive and unbiased in its coverage of international, national, local, sports and business news.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Good way read news and sports,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Good but few issues,4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Great news reporting not bias,5

Microsoft News,News,medium," Great app after finding that i could reorganize my interests in the order i wanted. i really really dislike ads though. i mean this world really is becoming like Blade Runner, ridiculous. The ads don't obscure the experience but its kinda ridiculous nowadays days.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, When I try to open a news article it just spins as it tries without success to actually open article. Microsoft drops the ball once again. Was a great app once upon a time.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, This is the best news app by far. It has so much news that most of the time you'll never finish reading the articles there are so many. It is constantly updating its news articles. Good going Microsoft!,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, I get most of my headlines from this app. I have not been disappointed.,4
Microsoft News,News,medium, One of my favorite news apps. The custom feed aspects set the bar for how news apps should function. The way it pulls from multiple sources helps keep you honest rather than living in the completely biased world of a single source.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," I read this daily. i like it because it has catagories that make it quick to scan through, you can customize it, and the newest stories are on top.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Excellent News source app. It is quickly becoming my go-to daily news feed. It provides a lot of category choices depending on your taste. Highly recommended for news junkies.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," unfortunately microsoft's phone OS is not a thing, so a perfect world of my phone and laptop being connected are probably all but gone. thankfully this app exist and you can at least get your media feeds linked on both platform in an almost seemless way!",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, One problem that I have with this app is that when I open notification for breaking news it just takes me to empty page with just headline written and a photo saying breaking news. That's it nothing else. What am I supposed to do with just headline and a photo just saying breaking news?,3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Good sources, few paywalls, better results.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," This news app provides fairly good updates of news throughout the day. I've learned to avoid the ""sponsored"" content, which are basically ads disguised as ""newsworthy info"", or tabloid quality filler.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium, Good collection of the current news harvested from other original news sources. When you connect to the story you may have to accept cookies or advertising emails from them.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Great app for getting articles from a bunch of news sources. The only feature that would be nice is the ability to bookmark articles or save them offline,4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Used to be decent, light and handy app. Them it changed completely about 6 months ago into a bloated 500mb mess. My search continues for a multi outlet news app.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Great collection and very high quality. Select the topics onelikes. Concise and not many ads to cover the screen. Miscrosoft products are great and so are apps. Most are free, the laucher is really good too. Worth a tryvto see for yourselves.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Stale news don't disappear even after a month. Advertisements are sewn in between news articles very skillfully- but are such timewastes. This app is better than TOI on relevance of content but fairs very poor in quantity. I need to start looking for an alternative soon.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Selection of news sources is not an user option....... I use many great products from Microsoft. However, this app does not let the user select or influence the selection of news sources (unlike Google News)...... Uninstalled.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium, The stories are many in this app.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Very good app that provides all the news - - without a pay-wall that Flipboard has. This is my go-to app for all the news, including Washington Post and New York Times. Most important: no pay-walls!",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Love this app. It is well layed out and functional never had a problem with crashing and it keeps me updated on world events well ahead of any TV or radio news programs.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Used app for years as main news source, but it hasn't worked on my Samsung s9 since the update so I'm now searching for a new news app. Very disappointed as it was great before then but now it either doesn't load or I get a blank screen...",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Great news app, but it needs the ability to better adjust the fonts for people like me who can't see the screen on-the-go al that well. Otherwise, it's a solid news app.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, It's simplicity and fact that it's news is compiled from multiple and reputable news sources makes this a great choice and my number one on both pc and mobile .,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Habitual reading, variety of sources, and it's free.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Excellent source of news,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," like most legitimate news from other sources this news coverage has been very refreshing to read, there's a lot of variables in the coverage that make it interesting.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," lots of news aggregators out there. Microsoft news is fairly good, nice interface but I haven't figured out how to tune it for my interests yet. local, finance and politics tuning needed.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, I really like getting an overview from a range of different news viewpoints. It's much more balanced than just one feed.,4
Microsoft News,News,medium," displays same news for weeks, no frequent update of news, no auto refresh by msn. last version was good, this version needs to be verified thoroughly.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, One sided political articles without a straight forward point of view. Same as Google. I was hoping this would be more balanced - It's not. Removing the app.,2
Microsoft News,News,medium," the app itself is fine, nice having everything consolidated however the notifications are broken. im still getting random story notifications despite the fact i have it set to only give me breaking news. sorry microsoft but news about love island is not what id consider important breaking news....",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," I really appreciate that the news stories directly connected to don't have pay-wall issues, but the two annoying things are the repetition in the list of stories and the sorting order doesn't appear to always be chronological.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," The news presented in a liberal/socialist light, like 95% of the media outlets. Tech and science coverage is decent, but sometimes politicized too. Shame on Microsoft for not being able to stay impartial. App's functionality is great.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," The latest Interests updates have become wacky in how my Top News section is now polluted with ""news"" sites and wonderwall photo click bait type ""stories"". Hard to find the actual real news from established outlets like WPO WSJ and NYT in this sea of other junk news sites.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," The customization levels are nice. However, they stuffed with so much clickbait that it's essentially like the MSN page. I intentionally did not sign up for sports but they found their way to my page regardless because, well, clickbait.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium, I enjoy this news coverage. I read it each morning. I like the different selections.,4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Concise and plenty of information and index for speed of reading.,5

Microsoft News,News,medium, Very informative well laid out and an excellent selection of news and infotainment!,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Thank you Google for forcing me to look for another news app after you dumbed down yours. :D Thank you Microsoft for a mature, attractive and tailorable news app! 4 stars because there should always be room to improve.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, it's OK but I've asked not to see opinion and it still shows. Also needs an option to dismiss an article and not show it again. I've been seeing the same few headlines for weeks now.,2
Microsoft News,News,medium, Only used this app once. Opened 3 articles that were just clickbait and from websites with unrecognizable website names. That was convincing enough for me to immediately delete it.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, Love this app Provides all the current news. Works great. I've had no phone problems since installed. Recommend it highly to stay up to date on the news.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Why the category ""entertainment"" is always selected by default? Even after i remove, if i close the app and reopen, it comes with entertainment pre-selected. Need the ability to remove it. Please fix this.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium, When it was MSN it was a decent news app. Now it runs constantly in the background using battery and crashes all the time. Also the adverts disguised as articles are really annoying.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Best news aggregator period. Countless sources like AP, ,Routers, NYT, Fox, CNN etc. Text only option, breaking news alerts. Night or Day and font size options. Hope this app is here to stay. Thanks developer!",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," The ""sponsored"" articles are spam. They trick you by looking like a news article but direct you to spam sites. Outrageous. Sort it out. The news sources are also often opinion pieces, which hardly classes as news. Shocking.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium, It is fine but there is no way to copy a word. I think it is important to add copy options for the learners. That's why learners will get the meaning of a word easily and will help them to study better.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Every ball and Cricket score is pushed as notification on my mobile as BREAKING NEWS, even though i have not enabled any cricket news. Request the app developer to take some lessons on what should be categorize as breaking news and what shouldn't. if this continues i will have to uninstall this app.",1

Microsoft News,News,medium," Very handy, useful and elegant news app. It's very fast too. Thanks to Microsoft, we have it on all platforms",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Lots of options to customize your feed. I use this app for keeping up with USA news while abroad. Widget and notifications for only breaking news (usually less than once a day) cater to my news consumption.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Easy, good-looking app. Stable work. Local is only for big ones 😁. Still interesting for a big view in the case of bearing with some English.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Coming from Windows 10 Mobile, this app is not as good. Can we have the option of more widget sizes/customisation and the ability to scroll through news pages from left to right?",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Microsoft News used to be a very fine app, but they have made some changes in it recently which makes it so difficult to load that it's almost impossible to wait for the news to come up",2

Microsoft News,News,medium, A great way to get news from a variety of sources! Easy to navigate and easier to share on different social media platforms.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Pretty good news app, which I default to. It gets one star for prompting me to review it. I don't need an app asking me if it looks pretty each morning.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Each tab seems about the same as the previous. If an article is seen in one tab, remove it from next. Video often hangs with audio continuing. I see commercials twice on vidio feeds if I change screen orientation.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," I like the way I can quickly jump to what type of news I want to see whether it be my interests, Australian or worldwide. I like that I don't have to see sports results if I don't want to know yet.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Best mix of news of any app, well organized into categories. Not a lot of click bait like other news apps. You can customize it to your favorite categories and what news providers you like. I have it on Android and on Windows",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Better on windows phone but what the hell just use it anyway,4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Cant keep track of where you are in app. After you read a article and go back to read more it starts you over.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, Overall a good news app. It has a general overview on news. Any more depth would make it inconvenient.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," It's ok but why, when I'm reading from the app itself,do I get a ""Download the all new Microsoft News app "" message? It's irritating and makes no sense. I may aswell uninstall the app.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Wow it seems like Microsoft is back. News, To Do (which is by far the best i have used), Edge, Launcher. Next improve the system stability in Windows 10 and launch a small sized phone at a competitive price.. you are good to go.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," It's exellent app and very fast, it works flawless, it does for what is designed to do, great job guys, keep up the good work.",5

Microsoft News,News,medium," Like the stories offered...the format is well organized, makes it easy to find interesting topics and follow-up.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," it's okay But drop Taboola Ads, end the feed rather than repeat headlines. i have zero interest in some topics and should be able to deselect them. i like more regional feeds and i also like to see gobal non mainstream news with both left and right views so i can see whats really happening",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Good app, but has some update issues. Doesn't always have the most up to date stories and there are some stories which just never vanish?!",3

Microsoft News,News,medium," the news portion works great, but i give it very few stars because the inital set up is a pain the ass. just give me the news, i can remove sections after the app displays something.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, Quick way to keep abreast of recent news. Dint look for highly curated content. However the app provided easy to use interface and wide enough variety of content to keep using on a regular basis,4

Microsoft News,News,medium," always been good, but newest version slow to open. sometimes it refuses to do it.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium, Super news app! Way better than otherd that always too much oriented by the fata they gather from the device. This one is more like a real paper but with plenty of sources .,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," You choose the articles of news you want to read, from the platform you choose. Constantly updating and very user-friendly.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Don't rewrite how Android does orientation. How I hold my device is not yours to dictate. When you do, you force me to hold it weirdly. Android does 360 rotation and so should this app.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Works well for what it is. Nothing special, but I have been using the automatic Google articles and they are all random trash now. A feast I know that this app will actually display my interests.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, I keep turning off the notifications and as soon as I re-boot my phone they are back on again. It is extremely annoying. That is why I am deleting the program I am tired of Micro Soft trying to control my life.,1

Microsoft News,News,medium," just don't like the ""sponsored"" ads that never go away. good app with good news coverage. easy to use and tailor to what you want to read about.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, I use google news and wanted to branch out to other services. Too many of the articles in this app are filled with click-bait websites and so many ads that ita almost impossible to even read the article. Too bad another Microsoft product sucks.,1

Microsoft News,News,medium," It would be great if one could filter out news that are not relevant to personal interest, eg. Filter out anything that contains so and so in the title.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium, What the hell is wrong with Microsoft? Are you serious? You are inserting ads to download your app when we already have it. What's happening Microsoft...lost your sense???,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, Good selection of news. Neat layout. But rating only 4 because it does not send alerts regularly. I expect at least one every hour.,4

Microsoft News,News,medium," Shame on you Microsoft for joining fake news media! Very bias anti-Trump oriented application that is not only discasting, but also poltisized and very left oriented. News media should be reporting facts and be neutral, Microsoft News become nothing more than fake propoganda. SHAME ON YOU!!!",1

Microsoft News,News,medium," I like the news on this app , you can choose your preferred topics .",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, News without paywall. Sometimes not updated often.,4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Broad ranging News coverage,5

Microsoft News,News,medium, The formatting of articles is bad and random text in the middle of articles about downloading the Microsoft News app when you're already using the Microsoft News app is just sloppy.,3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Installed it and under top Hollywood news all the news were outdated by months even years.. For eg MI6 to be shot in India, Venom gets a release date... Too significant to be overlooked in a news publishing app.. Uninstalled it after seeing 10 or so outdated articles",1

Microsoft News,News,medium, News app it's great and I use it from old days with Windows Mobile. Please remove add for app what we actually using. Download Microsoft news app. It it's pathetic. You are software gigant and you can't write code to skip that app when it's detected? Come on.,3
Microsoft News,News,medium, App is ok but the developer should create a unique branded sound alert for breaking news notifications. Just using the device default notification sound is lazy.,3
Microsoft News,News,medium, Really strange assortment of news categories from which to choose. Customization was lacking for certain topics.,2
Microsoft News,News,medium," News apps, especially from a large corporation like Microsoft should never incorporate advertising. News is a place for news, and nothing else. This app displays advertisements in news lists and articles. That is gross.",1

Microsoft News,News,medium," I like the news and stories, especially the diversity of sources. The adds are annoying.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, After the update it can't keep my preferences about topics and it desperately needs the ability to hide news from specific sources. Overall is a good app.,3

Microsoft News,News,medium," A bit of a faff to open up, but easy to navigate and find what you're interested in.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Great news app. Would love to see offline capabilities though. Bit annoying seeing articles saying download the new Microsoft news app within the app,4

Microsoft News,News,medium, Some of the Stories kept dragging on. You get tired of having to change pages. Finally I just quit because I lost interest.,4
Microsoft News,News,medium, I have probably tried 2 dozen news apps over the past 10 years and I always come back to this. It has the clearest layout and least ads. GREAT APP!,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," I appreciate if you can stop publishing silly stuffs like the apparel a celebrity was wearing and focus on more real issues. Apart from that, its a worthy needed and recommended app.",5

Microsoft News,News,medium, Doesn't seem to search topics from as many sources or quite as up to date as a few other top news apps but still a great news app. Getting better as they work on it.,4

Microsoft News,News,medium, Great way to in touch with news local and around the world. Great idea by tapping on an article you can change the front size. It the bottom of the scene. Why can't this app be interactive.,5

The satire and/or humor provides a little relief from the intensity of the topic, more if one actually laughs aloud.

'My News' section is a misnomer as you have no choice of what it contains. No ability to delete topics of news you don't want. BBC app now far superior in that you have the autonomy to choose the content and format.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Slow, clunky, unpleasant, much worse user-experience than MSN News.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Nothing here outside of conventional US media. Too much WashPost and NYT with paywalls. Feels limited and rather like a mental trap.,3

Very annoying. Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to load the news. Lots of problems loading even when using multiple devices. Tried uninstalling and re-nstalling but it still takes a long time to load. There are much better programs than this out there.,2
Microsoft News,News,medium, It is very identical to what we get on windows 10 but crashes and lags all the time for some reason. Also I think it would be better to scrap all msn apps (as none of them works well right now) and combine them in one.,4

While fonts are adjustable, they are like egg sizes: large is barely medium, medium is really small and small is forget about it. Clearly, they don't care about visually impaired readers. May have to uninstall, soon. If you are vision challenged, keep looking. Microsoft -- just barely three stars, using a Samsung tablet.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium, Wish the app was able to display embedded tweets and Instagram posts included in the articles. Often have to move back to browser version to see all content. Should have been addressed by now as an issue.,3
Microsoft News,News,medium, I tried other news viewers but came back to Microsoft News because it simply works the way I expect. It has learned the sources and topics I like and shows me what I want to see--effortlessly.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," I'm wedded to this as a Windows 10 News user because it allows me to follow my news interests on my my PC, laptop, and phone. I love the dark mode. It could really use a good widget though.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Stories from the gutter press and advertising online gambling so children can become addicts too .. Disgusting company,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, I like it better than most of the other news apps it's not perfect but it's very good. I read generally about 50 gigs of news every month MSN is always included,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," algumas notícias tem um segundo link e são propaganda, mas fora isso adoro o app",4

Other than the 'Topics' section missing in the Android version it's a good app. A couple of apps I use look better on my Windows Phone.

It's 7Feb15 and I am uninstalling app because I have not been able to use it all week and just uninstalled, installed.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, It was my go to app for news but since last few updates it does not automatically refresh and takes ages to load. The splash screen should not be there as it's animation causes the app to slow,3
Microsoft News,News,medium, Paid content mixed in with news stories cheapens the experience and feels sleazy and deceptive. Topics and story selection feels limiting. I expected better. Uninstalled.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium, Links in articles are hard to read. Light blue text on a white background really doesn't work well. Edit: There's a dark mode that fixes that problem.,4

Microsoft News,News,medium," It keeps crashing, even when running in the background. It keeps trying to push news notifications even though I turned them off and thus it sends me ""Microsoft News has stopped working"" pop-ups. I'm fed up",1

Even on high profile news days at least half the feed would be about a Kardashian or Real Housewife. Uninstalling for good. Years ago it was better, even the desktop version is better. Don't download unless you have a hankering for reading about silicon and saline filled women doing pilates.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Most of the reviews for this app are probably fake. You cannot set the default font in 2018! Nuff said? You cannot save articles for reading later. Clearly, Microsoft needs to rethink whether the current product manager for this app is doing his/her job.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," I do not like the new News app. Scrolling behavior is very odd. If I stop my finger or lift and put it down, the screen will keep scrolling.

If I stop my finger or lift and put it down, the screen will keep scrolling. It also does not contain financial information like the Microsoft Money app, but it's being pushed as a replacement in that app. Why are you trying to get me to stop using the Money app and switch to this one, which is a very poor replacement?",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Its a good aggregator. BUT they tilt liberal. AND certain stories stay on the news page for weeks, sometimes months. Usually anti-Trump fact checks that have long since left the news cycle. WHY? Only MS knows.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Overall it's a solid app that suffers from several issues. Every so often 
the app fails to open properly with only one category properly loading up. 
The other major issue is that the categories keep resetting back to what I 
selected for the first time multiple times within a week.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," The app no longer goes past the splash screen that shows the word ""news"" in 
multiple languages. I've tried rebooting, uninstalling and reinstalling. I 
really like the aggregated content and wish I could see it again.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium, It's a really great app for catching up on all the latest news around the world. It also aggregates news across various geographical boundaries and varied topics. If you are voracious reader then this is a must have app.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Loads and updates quickly, lots of topics to choose and refuse. Hundred of news articles from different news sources making it unbiased. You can also swipe up our down to browse and it has a dark light feature 10/10",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Keep up to date with details of the latest and greatest political soap opera ever! Every day there's a new nauseating twist to the plot. Ladies and gentlemen step right...get your peanuts...popcorn...candy...,4
Microsoft News,News,medium," A reasonably good app but doesn't seem to catch latest news stories as effectively, or perhaps not in the way I'm used to with up to the minute news services. Easy to use.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Articles should be organized by groups. It's too disorganized. Sometimes I 
only have a little time to read & want to focus on one type.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," It has the makings of being a great app there just is not enough content on

the platform itself. There is content but if I wanted a well rounded view 
of everything I am concerned about in the world, the options are very 
limited. People like to scroll. They like a great distraction. On a news 
platform, I expect nothing less. However it does have the workings of a 
great app.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Interesting and informative news from around the world. Works well on my Android phone (Galaxy S5 neo, so not leading edge) and very quick to load stories. Scrolling is very smooth. It's a nice app to use.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," The app is good but i have got one major issue with the widget. The latter 
shows the same headline for hours together. It looks boring and shluld get 
refresh frequently.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, For the last several days the images in the news feeds are not showing. About 90% of the images are showing a gray box where the picture should be. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still see the same problem. Samsung Galaxy S8.,2
Microsoft News,News,medium, As a former Lumia user I still enjoy this news application compared to other. MSN and now Microsoft is unique with easy to access your desired contents. Great job team Microsoft (And if you guys reading this please bring back Lumia!),5
Microsoft News,News,medium," With the most recent update the splash screen appears to be in a constant 
loop and the app ceases to function. Have been using it for awhile and I am 
disappointed in the recent update. Fix the problem and this review will be 
irrelevant.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Biased news program that only shows news from one political spectrum or view, no balance, no alternatives and only one viewpoint. You'll only see CNN, MSNBC, WAPO, NYT and Huffington. So if you want lack of balance and suppression of independent news organizations then this is for you.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," There is a whole lot of click-bait items mixed in with poorly done news 
articles. not worth cluttering a device with this app.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Good, seems to not like switching between WiFi and 4g - scrolls through 
news in multiple languages endlessly. Which the content was not so heavily 
based on tabloid sources in the UK - the sun, mirror etc",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," They've ruined this app. It used to be a tight layout with impartial news, 
now it's slow, oversized and pushing an agenda. Uninstalled.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," It's the best news app around but the breaking news needs work it only 
shows half of the news you need to log in to see the rest other then that 
it's very easy to use",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," This app use to work great but since the update, it only flashes through 
the languages trying to open but never does... Please fix this! I have 
Kyocera Dura Force Pro.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," It's just far left liberal news. Politics from CNN, weather news from Fox. That's what faking it is all about. Pretending to have multiple sources but very biased in reality.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," This app doesn't show the latest news.. believe me it showed the same 
sports news for two days though so much things were happening around the 
world .",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Stopped working. ""Network error"" on wifi and carrier network. If it loads at all, only det black screen. Way to screw up one of my ""go to"" apps!",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," I enjoy the ""Cliff Notes"" version of the news this app offers. It delivers just the right amount of information early on with the ability to investigate more deeply if I'm interested.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," The app works fine on my tablet device, I like it that when I click on the icon the app opens in the orientation that I am holding my tablet in. I would give the app 5* if I could customise it so I could see how my shares are doing.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," It would be nice if I can hide a news or topic or publisher. Toilet paper 
of India as usual showing anti national news and I can't even hide it. 
Though will surely report it.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, This app has evolved to being a very useful source of catch up news. The format is now easy to navigate and stable and works well for quick scanning.,4
Microsoft News,News,medium," I've been using more Microsoft services lately so I can better sync stuff with my PC and this is definitely a good app. Clean, sleek, easy to use.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," 'My News' includes some clap trap lie from the Daily Mail. Who filters this 
rubbish! Uninstall.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Rarely updates any news items compared to other apps unless its ""top stories"" many stories are not readablee as sources want subscriptions.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," Great app all around but lacks on home ground local news . can't find where 
to delite history sites .All in one 5 star",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, Could be the best but too many sponsored stories and click bait make this just OK... Hopefully a multi billion dollar company someday starts thinking about the user experience over fleecing folks and misleading readers,3
Microsoft News,News,medium," This app is purely Liberal propaganda, highlighting only negative articles about President Trump.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium," Seems to have a small number of news sources - the same articles appear 
repeatedly.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," Far too many advertiment related notifications so have switched off the 
alerts.",3
Microsoft News,News,medium," I loved this News app! Its very Clean simple and so organized. Section to 
sections. Topic to topic. You get what I mean to say.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Microsoft News has much of what you want. Ads (Sponsored) are easy to identitfy. Items are presented simply. Customize what you want to see for the most part. As for left or right views, you decide.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Works well, could load a bit faster. Several iterations to get the content right",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, Only 2 stars because it doesn't has bangla religion or bangla news... add my country Bangladesh as an edition so that i can get my country's news... Thank you. 😊,1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Aside from my browser, this is my main news app and that is saying everything.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium, news stories are good but i would like to see a live scrollable widget instead of having a stagnant one show the same stories for days,3
Microsoft News,News,medium, I trust it because it features stories from many diverse news outlets so I feel I am getting many viewpoints.,5
Microsoft News,News,medium," It's just amazing. Very clean design with no lag at all. You should 
definitely download it!",5
Microsoft News,News,medium," Very useful apps, love it... But I'm not getting news notifications... 
please fix it.",5
Microsoft News,News,medium, It keeps pestering me to download it when I'm already using it. Dumb or what!,3
Microsoft News,News,medium, News stories are cleverly mixed in with clickbait and ads. Old format was so much easier to use. Will be uninstalling in favorr of a legit News site.,1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Nicely laid out. I enjoy the opportunity to select topics and sources. I 
like that this app syncs with Microsoft News on Windows 10",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Works well. Hasn't crashed, frozen or done anything worthy of deleting it.",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," No longer works. So it's less than an app. Can't give it more than one star, wish I could give it less.",1
Microsoft News,News,medium," Thankful for what is available at present, but more country specific, well 
updated news as frequently as possible would be appreciated",4
Microsoft News,News,medium," Too many adds, not customizable enough. You'll be scrolling for days.",2
Microsoft News,News,medium, This thing is a mess of clutter. Uninstalling and going back to the website.,1

Utterly useless. All they do is redirect you back and forth from the app to the site, or to having to sign back in. Seriously every single option besides tracking does not work. I've sat down and shown people and no one can make sense of it . The most frustrating thing I've ever dealt with. How are yall still in business?",1

Easy to navigate to view current and past deliveries, and make changes to deliveries (ex: release package without signature e.t.c). I've come to use and appreciate this app more than I expected!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," The app seems to be consistently accurate. The only drawback is that the app doesn't state what vendor, company, or entity a package is coming from. When expecting packages from different people or places, this would be good info to know. Otherwise, very good!!!",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Does not run just a circle running round,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Great App. Love the automatic updates. Some of the senders names are listed and some not. That can be frustrating at times.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, It's very easy to use,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Works great...as soon as you open your confirmation e-mail and hit the tracking number it automatically transfers to the app and then you don't have to open your confirmation email again after that. Then you just open the app and it's right there to monitor. Love it!!!! It works great!,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Very Helpful!! This app is so great. I love how it detects UPS tracking numbers that you receive by email and through other mobile apps. Plus you can scan in your own tracking numbers to track packages that you send out. I definitely recommend this app.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," It's pretty good about keeping you updated about tracking, the USPS app is better, but this app is as close to a close second to that app as it comes.",4

They let me know if there has been a change in delivery or time. They always deliver during the time and date promised. I have never had a problem with a delivery. I cannot lift heavy items and the drivers will always set the package inside the house for me so the package is not left outside for a long period of time. I applaud all the drivers for their kindness and courtesy in delivering items to me. Thank you so much UPS!,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," This app is so helpful. I can easily track packages, actually track the delivery truck on deliver day and more. I highly recommend this app. Also, the option of receiving updates on package progress is a great hit with me. Love it! Besides, UPS is by far the best.",4

Not to mention that I have wasted hour of my time which I will never get back. The developer needs to go back to the drawing board on this,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, This app is very helpful. It lets you see at a glance when your stuff will arrive. There are ootions you can do like have things delivered to a UPS store or other locations and I think you can adjust dates later also. I just use it to keep an eye on shipments. Highly recommend if dealing with UPS.,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium," I really appreciate this app. I live in a very small town, and my address is a bit tricky, (unmarked dead end street, looks like a driveway). With the app I know when to watch for the truck so I can go outside and ""help"" them find me.",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Great app as far as the tracking goes which is all I use it for. My only critique is that it would be nice to be able to set the default delivery location if you have multiple locations. Currently you can set it but it defaults back to the first address numerically.,5

If you are waiting on a delivery and you need to be there to get the package and you are given a several hour window, you could decide if you have time to go make a run or not before your package arrives. Most times its fine to sit at your home for several hours, BUT if you live in a bad neighborhood where 'things' seem to disappear without a trace, this feature could be handy. I believe when your package is scanned just before it's delivered, that scanner is connected via satellite to the internet so it could be possible.",4

First it does its own different coding of checking for WiFi or Data connection. When the phone itself already has that ability but the stupid app claims I have no internet service when I am using 4G LTE with full bars.   Then after refreshing the screen several times, it tells me where my package is and there are options available for shipping. But in order to do that, I have to register and sign into a separate service to manage that. Then after doing all that, it tells me, ""Service unavailable"".    Of the other three carriers, Canada Post, DHL, and Purolator, we have options without the need for signing in to two separate services of which both wanted unusual access to my phone including my contacts list, location and hardware control.  That last part is really stupid because even with hardware control, it could not tell I was connected to anything when I clearly was. A really stupid app. I bet all that permission they require is a way to mine our data for 3rd party purposes.",1

App tells me it can't give accurate tracking info b because the delivery address is different to the my choice address - it isn't. You give consent for them to leave parcels without a signature, they take your parcel to a collection point because it needs a signature! If your parcel is being delivered by UPS God help you!",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I love this app. I find it very helpful to be able to see when a package is getting delivered and when one has been delivered. I like seeing the process and movement of the packages. Just wanted to update. still love the app,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I love this app. I get notified when my packages are on the way, if there is a delay, and when they get delivered if it is to an address where I am not. It makes tracking your packages a no- brainer. Wish I had it years ago. Thanks UPS!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Keeps me aware of delivery dates. Not only through the app but I receive a message on my phone of expected delivery. I am aware of every step my package goes through right up to delivery. This app definitely works for me with the many packages I receive.,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium," Edited: I had the same issue as others. Forcing to recreate account. I found it is because it's a dumb app. You must logon to the website and verify your email address again, then it works good again. Rating changed but low since this issue is annoying. Hope this helps others!",3

UPS Mobile,News,medium, I love this app. Trying to guess when and if your package is going to be delivered can be stressful. With this app you get notifications the day before that you have a package being delivered. Then notifications when it is. I use it all the time.,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, How come I can not see all packages sent to my address regardless to the name of sender or receiver as in the case of wedding gifts. Shouldn't have to have to match packages with names or phone numbers. A name can not be added if a person already has an ups account.,3
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Would give it no stars if I could. This app won't let me log in half the time and when it does it won't let me see estimated times of delivery nor arrange alternate times/locations like it claims to do! So what is the point of this app if it doesn't do that?,1

UPS Mobile,News,medium," I don't know if the app actually works it works for tracking package but the delivery preference doesn't I guess I set my preference for all packages to be left at the front door and no signature required, and they still don't do it, and it is annoying.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I think this app is awesome. It's very nice to get immediate alerts when packages are coming. And it's also nice to know when packages have arrived with the immediate text alert that package has been delivered,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I love that I get such accurate updates on tracking my orders. I know when it will be delivered, can change the day it's delivered if I want to be there when it arrives or I can choose to pick it up at the UPS Customer Service Center or Access Point!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Very useful and accurate. Updates in real time and offers a great way to remotely use all of UPS' best features. However- an option to toggle back to the dark display would be much easier on my eyes.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," The display is good and easy to use. Should add ""leave message for driver"" function, the delivery instruction is not enough. I need space that I can write how I want my package to be shipped.",3

UPS Mobile,News,medium, Doesn't tell me anything more than the email notifications I got. This lazy excuse for an app even redirects to their normal site if you want detailed GPS tracking of vehicle. You may as well just use a web browser (for their site) instead of using this. Uninstalled.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," App is useless compared to browser. It kept wanting me to sign up for UPS MyShip after I already signed in with the account I use just fine for it in the mobile browser. Somehow, the app just can't reconcile one half of my profile info with the other.",1

UPS Mobile,News,medium," I signed up for this app as suggested in email which said it was a free app.  Then I was asked to enter my credit card information.  If it is a free app, why do you need my credit card information?  The app will not let me submit without that information.  Why?",2
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I love this app as I can track when my packages will arrive. UPS MyChoice is particularity nice as I can track in real time where my driver is and when they are in my neighborhood. It is so accurate that I've been able to meet my driver at the door. Definitely 5 stars!,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, I like the capability of tracking anticipated deliveries and the updates from ship date to package arrival.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Since it's my 1st time using the mobile app, my opinion is limited. I have always used UPS on my computer & I find that useful (except when UPDATES aren't applied in a timely manner). It's a busy season now & UPS is probably getting overwhelmed. U Re forgiven.",5

You can even just google ups tracking, put # n will show where package is. Guess some peeps are not to BRIGHT OR JUST DUMB!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, i like it. the main part I do like about the app is it gives you live tracking of the vehicle your package is on. It also automatically updates an alert you when you do have packages arriving.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Good application overall. I have pick up pending, but the application shows 'Reaft for UPS' which is confusing. The same message is displayed on the website, so I don't think it is application's fault.",4

I can even see where the truck is on the day of delivery - in my town, in my neighborhood or on my street. The app also sends delivery notices. The best feature, in my opinion, is the fact that your tracking number is included in every text; you don't have to find it every time you want to check on the status of your package. Robin, MD",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, The app is easy to work around. You type in your tracking number and it manages it all for you. You can keep track very easily. Looks of it is easy and what i love is an easy way to get from point A to the end of the alphabet.,5

My personal experience was I was expecting a delivery on a Friday when something came up and I had to leave town on Thursday for 4 days. Typically my driver leaves my parcels at the front door.

UPS Mobile,News,medium, Works and linked to emailed tracking nu.bers which expedites updates!,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Like knowing when things will get here. Very user friendly!,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, App works awesome.Was easy to navigate threw and very helpful.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I love this app because it tells you where your package is and it gives you an estimated time of arrival on the day that your package is supposed to be delivered it's amazing And you can keep track of every single package through UPS right here on this app😁😁😁😁😁😁,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Absolutely appalled. Only AFTER the lengthy sign-up proccess did I have the option to check if the tracking service was even avaliable in my area and turns out it isn't. So now they have my personal data for nothing. Waste of time and pointless invasion of privacy.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Great app. I thought I would have to enter tracking numbers for my 2 package manually, but as soon as I opened the app all the information was right there.",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Jumped through all the hoops to register, only to find it only allows you to have a parcel redirected to one of their access points. Disappointing and a total waste of time installing. Other company's app allow redirection to a local address.",2
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Good solid app. I would like them to improve driver instruction text a little more than this door and PIN. Drivers for some reason don't ring doorbells or read notes then leave doortags that I must not be home.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I love this app and the information it provides; however, I get two exact emails every day to my same address...Only one is sufficient as they are identical. Thank you.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," For some reason they limit the amount of characters in an email for login, and my ups email has more characters than is allowed, so the app is completely worthless. Bizarre.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," So easy to manage any delivery coming to your house! Copy and paste your tracking number into your clipboard, then paste it into the app, give it a nickname, and set up what alerts you want. SO SIMPLE!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, The ability to track and manage packages with this app is excellent. I can see where the packages last location and can determine if I can still pick it up at a customer center.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, cannot get the app to work. reset pw several times and keeps saying I need to confirm with email that is sent but yet I am not getting the email. so it says request another but you can't and makes you go through everything again and again. frustrated!,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Absolutely HORRIBLE! The login sucks ridiculously. programmer needs to be replaced. Take the app down until the wrinkles are ironed out. Don't waste your time on it.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," not thought through. Takes you through to sign up to do anything, but if you are already signed up it won't let you log in which means you are stuck doing anything. I always groan when somebody is sending me a parcel via ups",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I think some lazy coding is present on this app when it shouldnt be.

I have a package coming today and the web shows in transit as the driver hasnt left yet, but the app says its out for delivery. Seems like the app just says that because its scheduled for today. The app also shows the note from yesterday morning when the package was picked up, but not the 3 statuses that have happened since. Only benefit is i can see tracking numbers way faster than via email to know somethings coming.",2
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Its fantastic... I have advance notice of my packages and where they're coming from. I can make delivery changes and I can see their progress. I love it when my senders use UPS! They make other shippers look 50 years behind when it comes to logistics.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," An excellent way to keep up with ALL your packages, going and coming!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Worst app ever keeps glitching wont let you edit and put the right address keeps saying not found and keep making you sign up again with you are already sign in,1

UPS Mobile,News,medium," Never have had an issue , the app is well structured work very well.easy to use.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," In this day of 'porch pirates', so glad to have this available to track our packages. We really like using UPS!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, It's always someone else's problem. I've called 5 times telling them something is wrong and no one can help you have to wait we can't do anything.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Good for tracking when your packages are going to arrive.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," For some reason I can't make an account, I've tried the desktop website, the mobile website and now the app (which just links to the mobile website). Please fix this 🙏",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Does what it is supposed to do. The app is well behaved. I like being able to nickname trackings. That makes it easier to monitor multiple shippings in progress.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Love, love that it automatically sends notifications whenever my address is selected to receive a package. I also LOVE the real time tracking of a package on the truck to my home.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I really like this app. When I receive a tracking number from a retailer and I copy it, this app recognizes the number before I paste, and it asks if I want to use this new copied tracking number for my search 👍😀",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," They keep updating the Terms and Conditions agreement ! I usually know nothing about a package being delivered until AFTER it arrives.

I usually know nothing about a package being delivered until AFTER it arrives. I then open up the app, and sure enough - it is waiting for me to click to agree, to their Terms and Conditions. I guess UPS values keeping their attorneys happy, over the public being able to use the app we pay $50 to use.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," App works well but it's slow to load, it does what it's supposed to tho so no complaints",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," very good app. I love the fact that I can copy a tracking number in my email, open the app and it will say we see you copied a tracking number would you like to track it now.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Always get the most up-to-date information. I recommend this App for all to have a great experience with UPS,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Makes it so easy to track and control my package deliveries. Love the fact that I dont have to copy and paste tracking numbers any more, the UPS app does it automatically.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," excellent app! I always know when my packages are on their way, when to expect them and when, and if they have been delivered.. it's very user friendly and practical.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," My favorite feature is when I have a tracking number copied into the clipboard, then open the app, it will recognize the tracking number and ask if I want information on it.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," It's ok, though for the information it provides you might as well just use the website. Kind of slow too, and the UI is kind of confusing sometimes.",3
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I like the app but I continue to lose notifications for packages because every time the app upgrades, all notifications cease until I open and agree to the terms and conditions. Please either stop modifying the app or stop changing terms and conditions.",3
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Excellent app.Very accurate&up to date. Keeps me informed in""real""time as to where my packages are&when they'll be delivered.Then gives me the exact time& precise location of my delivery!EXCELLENT!!",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Love this app, fedex and usps need to catch up. You can see exactly where the truck is on a map, very helpful if you don't want your package sitting outside your door.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," app is nice when it works, but regularly will drop all of my saved packages, display nothing, then when I try to reload them will say tracking information unavailable. I dont see the point in using it if it only works maybe 30% of the time.",2
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Sometimes gotta click to bring keyboard up to select ""done"" in order to continue. Would be better if they had a continue button, but app is generally fast and reliable once you learn the quirk of this feature. Easy to understand interface otherwise.",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I always have issues when I click on tracking # when in a app where i purchased product that's being delivered. It doesn't show up in my ups app under my sign in,3
UPS Mobile,News,medium, No way to know what time package will arrive tried to enter password will not work app is nothing but a waste of time unless you're a rocket scientist,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Alerts me of my package coming without having to input tracking number on website. Works great.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Always on time, did leave a package uncovered one day when it was raining but I was home and went and got it immediately.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Difficult. Gives error stating I already have ID tried to recover ID then tried to recover password. Sucks!,2
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Gives you more details about your packages then just looking up a tracking # does. Makes it more convenient when you're expecting deliveries.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I use it a lot and love when it tells me I have a package coming that I didn't even know about,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Worst delivery service in the world! I had an order scheduled for today with UPS PREMIUM, next day UPS service.

At 12.30h I went to check the tracking site and it was saying that the package couldn't be delivered, but I was home and nobody knocked... Its the 3° time that I've ordered online using UPS services and 2/3 UPS failed to deliver it. The first time it happened the I gave them the benefit of doubt, but again its unacceptable. When I found the Infonotice, I gave UPS a call, although I was",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Always reliable. And let's me know where my shipment is.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Useful app for tracking packages. Only issue is that it doesn't let you delete old addresses. Moved over 3 years ago but it still defaults to my old address.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, This is a fine app and keeps up on tracking in real time. Love it. Very easy to work with and very user friendly. The app actually does all the work.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Really good App. Easy to use. i do a lot of shopping online and i love to be able to track my packages and this App helps me do just that. Thank You.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Very handy app. Visibility into all shipments - coming and going. In today's world of online shopping this functionality is a must have.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Slow and no better than its online equivalent. Takes ages to retrieve any information. While UPS continues not to offer estimated 1 or 2 hour delivery windows like most of its competitors then the app has little additional benefit.,3
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Really the only thing I don't like about it is that there isn't a dark mode any more. I'm really not into everything having a white background. Just give a choice, white or black background.",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Excellent app for fitting daily scheduling of deliveries. Able to set instructions for leaving packages, even sign ahead of time. Easy to use. Overall highly recommended.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I just started using this app and so far it is working very well. I evaluate this app on 3 criteria, ease of use, on point, and the ability to alter the outcome. It does all 3.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Generally useful, I always get the info I'm looking for regarding status of a shipped package. The navigation when tracking multiple packages is cumbersome. The PC based AP is easier to use",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Nice app. Tracks packages usually. At times they show a package arrived somewhere and then days later it updates to out for delivery. I suppose the app can only work on the data given.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Easy-to-use way to track my packages. I do miss the ""live tracking"" where I could see where the truck was located in my area to get a better idea of when my package would be delivered rather than just a 5 hour window that it now shows.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, it is a (little) difficult to navigate the application needs improvement for how to get a delivery person on the phone or online. not easily accessible very frustrating application to maneuver around...made me very upset!!!,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," by far,this is the MOST DEPENDABLE APP IN ITS FIELD when it comes to everything from customer services to tracking.....its almost as if YOUR riding alone with the Driver...to be HONEST...UPS IS LEAPS & BOUNDS OVER ALL IN ITS FIELD..I LOVE IT.......Mr.Chester B. Jefferson Sr.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I love the UPS Mobile app. I love being able to follow the truck and see when it is close to my house. We received a lot of packages, so it is very nice to be able to track the packages and actually follow the driver.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," When I click on Track, it will say I don't have a package on the way...even though I just saw it in route on the truck under Manage! Other than that i like the app!!",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," App is ok for the most part. Now actual delivery can be hit and miss, but most services are the same. Online UPS gives same info, but app is somewhat easier to use.",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," App works OK when logged in. Problem is, when using a linked Google account to log in, it becomes logged out every time you close the app and you have to re-log in every time app is opened.",3
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Sign in required constantly, screen after screen, again and again!!! The email address verification link is HIDDEN in the email as normal black text! So pissed off I cannot recommend this app at all!",2
UPS Mobile,News,medium," very difficult to setup account. the AI just could NOT recognize an apartment number. after multiple attempts, it finally got it. I'm not impressed with this app at all.",2
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I really like this app. The new Follow my shipment feature is a really nice addition. I also like that I can manage delivery and shipping instructions. Very well done.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," It is not possible to set the preference for UPS pickup point, after first delivery attempt. After selecting the pickup point, it tells me I am trying to leave the screen without saving my preference. Doesn't work like related 'skip my house and deliver directly to pickup point option'.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," App works good, for a while it showed a real time map, but not any more",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, This app is easy to navigate through plus this app keep you updated on your deliveries very well.this app is worth having.,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, Works as described. Can follow packages been set so there not missed.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, I do a lot of desktop computer work. I like the UPS app because it is not always convenient to get to my computer to check the status of my inbound packages. This app lets me check status on my phone wherever I am,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, I'm really enjoying the app you get text notifications and you also have the ability to send updates to the driver like where you want your package dropped I would like additional options like behind screen door etc.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, This app is very accurate & it's so mych better to interact w/ UPS directly when expecting a delivery as opposed to a vendor. it makes receiving packages alot easier when U know exactly when to expect it. Just try it if U get deliveries.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Easy, simple installation, app does most of the heavy lifting, shows exactly what criteria are required at each step. Nice.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Great app. Give's you all the information you need to assist in a safe and secure package delivery. If you have ever had a delivery from UPS or may in the future, you should have this app.",5

UPS Mobile,News,medium," when away, the ability to control your package(s) en route to its destination is cool, would have given it 5 stars, some changes cant be done unless an delivery attempt is made. still a good app tho.",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, this is a very convenient app and lets me know location of my shipments and almost the exact time that it's going to arrive. I am very pleased with the app and makes it so much easier.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Great app to keep track of all my incoming packages being delivered . Also to track them from shipper to being delivered to me.I always know where they are and when they will be delivered.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Hey your web site's Schedule a Pickup has been down for more than 48 hours now, beginning Sept 22 or earlier. Would it be faster for you to add that missing feature to this app than restart/fix what's broken over there?",2
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Definitely room for improvement within the app itself. Still beats FedEx hands down. The two are going in total opposite directions. My choice is UPS for quality of services and management skills.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Easier to use than the website. starts and retrieves data quickly.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Easy to keep up with pkgs, great way to plan your day if you worry about pkgs being left unattended.",5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, The app is quite good. It's better than the last delivery I had yesterday. I guess he was just filling in for my regular carrier. Luckily nothing was damaged. He didn't even see me standing in the doorway. Anyways I am happy with the app.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Ok, but could be better. I shouldn't have to add tracking numbers. FedEx and USPS apps automatically include packages coming to me. But now, the app isn't responding even after update.",3
UPS Mobile,News,medium," why is your app impossible to use. Same as your website. ""Log in"" ""incorrect email"" ""sign up"" ""email already in use"" ""forgot password"" ""invalid email"" ""sign up"" ""email already in use"". What the F***",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Very useful tool. Lets you reroute or upgrade your package among other things. What's not to love? Has ads, but not in your face..",5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, I like the app I find it convenient for tracking packages. I dislike the fact I cant delete an address I no longer live at. Plus it keeps defaulting to it everytime I open the app. Very Annoying.,3
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Doesn't keep you logged in. Everytime I go to check my packages or to track a package I have to log into my account, and it is a pain to do that everytime I want to go on the app.",1

UPS Mobile,News,medium, I desperately needed to have a package held at UPS until I get back from vacation and this app made it so simple. It took me a few minutes of my time and I was all set up for pick up when I get home at my closest UPS Store.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Just downloaded it. Appears to be very user friendly if I could do it and has some exciting features that I'm really looking forward to like customizing my deliver if needed. Should make life so much easier.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Even automatically detects new shipments to my address and tracks them with 1 tap to confirm! MUCH BETTER THAN THE WEBSITE!!!,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Works as advertised. I use it to easily track my UPS packages.,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium," Doesn't update often enough, dont always tell where our packages are at, sometimes don't know at all",4
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Great for tracking packages. But I don't think they read where to put my package. I have rear door for my preference, but it almost always gets left on my front porch. I don't understand this. Why have an option if it gets ignored.",3
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Excellent, only one thing Please ring bell or knock hard when package/s arrive! Thank you.",5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, The app never recognizes when I'm connected to wifi and won't work until I disconnect and use my data. Seriously this app sucks. I never have wifi problems with any other app.,1

UPS Mobile,News,medium, I love being text letting me know an estimated time my package will be delivered or has been delivered. Now it shows you on a map about where the truck is in respect to my home. Love this app.,5

UPS Mobile,News,medium," Total garbage you cannot even enter your address without telling you everything is wrong. Once you spent 3 hours registering and close the app once you open it again it ask you to register again. I want my 3 hours back, what a disappointment",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," very happy. when a shipment to my address is recognized, the app automatically notifies me. no need to enter tracking number. very real time updates. delivery notifications within minutes.",5

UPS Mobile,News,medium, App is very convenient only thing I don't like is when you have to sometime put in your password information after your phone sometimes updates but it is very good to have all the features work from my experience,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Keeps logging me out, and when i drop things off using my email, the package never shows up in the app",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Awful...to say that this app is a heaping pile of steamy garbage would be generous. Horrible functionality and UI. UPS makes simple things asinineically hard with this app.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," very poor with delivery, app and online tracking, nothing works! still not receive package and tracking doesnt work!",1

UPS Mobile,News,medium, Easy to understand. Great app with many uses and features.,4
UPS Mobile,News,medium, The app works great except for I usually get noticed that my orders have been delivered a couple hours after I receive them. 🤣,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, The app doesn't tell me when packages have been delivered even though I set it to text me at all stages of delivery. And you're supposed to be able to redirect a package but there's no obvious way to do it. I don't know what its good for.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Not sure what the questions have in relevance to the app, but found the app relatively easy to use. I like the app and will use it every time I use UPS for my package needs. Recommend it!!!!",4

UPS Mobile,News,medium," Great app, I don't know why but I love knowing where my package is and this does the trick. The vaca holds and leaving notes for your driver make things easy too.",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Don't waste your time. Absolute rubbish. Continually asking for acknowledgement of email address, sends you to Web page, doesn't see a scheduled delivery despite inputting the scheduled package number. Its not an app. Uninstalled it.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, S*** app and sign up process to try and change delivery options. Created an account but keeps looping with a signing up process for ups mychoice when I've already done it!! Really infuriating as it doesnt seem to linknthe mychoice sign uo with the account created???????,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I just used the app backed out, went back in and get locked out. Pain in the ass, was still connected and now none my passwords will work. When i get my package ill never use the app again, nor will it be recommended to abyone i know.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, Tracking is not available. I spent my whole morning waiting for the UPS truck because it kept saying the driver will arrive soon. That was 3 hours ago. Have to change my schedule just to wait for my package because it needed my signature. App not use full at all.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Asking me to sign up to ups my choice when I already am. I seem to be in an eternal loop where I sign in, am then asked to sign up, I put my details in and it tells me I'm already signed up. Can't proceed beyond this point at the moment.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium, It works but could use some more choices like for multiple orders.,4

UPS Mobile,News,medium, I can't even install the app. It just keeps waiting for download which has now taken over 40 minutes. This is the 4th time I've tried to install the app with the same results. What a waste of time. Maybe you should hire some Americans to write your software.,1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," I love the ability to change my delivery date, address or whatever I need to change and also to be able to see any updates/changes to my deliveries. Great app, Bo ads either",5
UPS Mobile,News,medium," Don't know what happened. Since latest update app wants me to log in, but WILL NOT do anything when I click the login button after entering login info. It used to be a very useful app. Now it is useless junk",1

UPS Mobile,News,medium, Very easy to keep track of my orders. Great easy app.,5
UPS Mobile,News,medium, The company and the app are useless both. You actually can't track anything after it's out for the first delivery. Customer service lied to me two times and I was sitting 10 hours at home waiting for nothing. No compensation offered so far. Disgusting.,1

I know that the drivers are suppose to ""knock"" when dropping off. It's not a big deal that they do because of the App and modern technology notifying me of my packages arrival. And it probably was an Amazon driver in their personal or company car. So I didn't notice. Anyway, the app works like it is suppose to. Only a few times I didn't get tracking info until the package was almost in my state or city. And that was the company failing to provide it. I'm sure it was NOT UPS fault. Happy with the App. Download it today and track a package for Christmas!!! Now it sounds like I'm a promoter or someone pushing the App!! LoL!!! I'm not. The App works.

It is all day from perhaps 0700 till whenever the driver feels like calling it a day. In my case it was not delivered on the date specified. No updates what so ever. When the updates start to appear they are hours late. So you check at 0700 to 1200. There is now an update from 0630?? Best thing about it was they did not even deliver it.

Delivery driver left notice that I needed to sign for the package three days in a row. First off, I was in the house in the very next room over at the times he supposedly knocked (my dog flips out at any knock, so I have my doubts he even knocked). I signed the back of the info notice he left saying he could leave the package. The driver ignored my signature and left the final info notice saying I can go pick it up across town. I order things online for convenience, so driving across town to pick up a package that was supposed to be delivered is frustrating. Ultimately, the most frustration came from not being able to easily submit feedback about this instance. I'd love if UPS had an easier way (or any way?) to get customer service and give feedback about drivers or situations.",1

UPS Mobile,News,medium," Never use the UPS Store location on Broadview Road in Parma, Ohio.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," So, basically to see when YOUR package that YOU PAID to be delivered by UPS arrives (if you're lucky), you have to sign a monster long agreement (visible only through a tiny window) where you waive many of your consumer rights. Sounds legit.",1
UPS Mobile,News,medium," The UPS app allows me total control of when, where, and how my UPS packages get delivered. In my opinion, that's all you/I/or any reasonable person should expect. Does what it promises.",5

It is easy to use, works every time I go to use it, and makes the ordering process quick and easy. It's very nice being able to walk in past the long line that is generally present at all locations and pick up my food usually with very little to no wait.",5

Velvet Taco,Entertainment,low, UNREAL!!!,5
Velvet Taco,Entertainment,low, I love Velvet Taco but the new location near me on Greenville in Dallas is SUPER slow. The mobile order pickup/drive-thru is supposed to be more convenient but it is not. It might as well be an actual drive-thru because the wait is just as long.,5
Velvet Taco,Entertainment,low, I like the app and it works quickly...but it doesn't save my card information even though I select that option. Please fix!,3
Velvet Taco,Entertainment,low," Great app for ordering, but it does not save the CC information, you have 
to reenter your information each time.",3

Zoup! Eatery,Entertainment,low," Pick up works fine, delivery is forwarded to Postmate or another delivery service, no return number.. driver marked delivery as delivered when it was not.. Zoup store has NO access to the delivery person... no accountability at all..not the apps fault but this is a very poor set up.. period..",1
Zoup! Eatery,Entertainment,low, Order came wrong. No obvious way within the app to let them know so they can refund the items that were missing. (I'll update the review when/if this is taken care of).,1
Zoup! Eatery,Entertainment,low, Can't verify email with spendgo so can't use crashes too,1
