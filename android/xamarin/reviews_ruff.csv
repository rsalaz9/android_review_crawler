It's really pretty, has awesome features like stashing and of course it has an auto dark mode that can be set to switch by the systems theme or by a scheduled time . The widget is also really beautiful. I could guarantee you, that you will love this app like I do! I really recommend you to support the developer!"

One recommendation: I would LOVE a desktop version to sync with. So many times I've had that impulse, and yet, alas. It's easy enough to export content, though cross-platforming it would be even more dreamy."

3,Michael Schneider,"April 21, 2020",5, Excellent design and distraction free writing! Syncing to something that's accessible on a desktop would be a nice to have option in the future. I am not sure there are note taking apps out there with an API to import the ruff notes.
4,Elijah Luckey,"April 4, 2020",5, Love the app and note-taking concept! Made the purchase to enjoy the additional features! Would love to see a few more font options. I enjoy monospace fonts a lot. Keep it up üôÇ
5,Chris Ferrell,"February 9, 2020",5," The Best note taking app I've used. Simple, reliable, with a super clean interface. Actually quite adorable! Responsive developer to feedback and support. Easily worth the upgrade!"
6,John Willman,"March 5, 2020",3," Going in the app, going to another app, than back in ALWAYS crashes it, I have 6gb of ram on my phone (OnePlus 6), so for my purposes it makes the app unusable. I love the design and the stashing mechanic it's just that it can't stay in memory."
7,Ziyad El Arroussi,"February 13, 2020",4, Good design. I don't really like the design of the checkboxes. It would be better if checkboxes had the design of... Checkboxes
8,cRAZy gOOd,"February 7, 2020",5," dev is awesome, as is the app 8)) and getting better all the time. highly recommend."
9,Mohamad Salman Alfarisi,"March 2, 2020",5," Best Note App for Android, simple design focused on my writing"
10,Simone Perra,"April 13, 2020",5, The simplicity of this is eye-opening. Love it!

But‚Ä¶ but the good things wouldn't last, after that my text getting longer and longer, the app goes slow, each time slower than before. And also, in my point of view the stash mechanism is rediculous. So I've changed my rate from 5 to 3 stars. Update: I have added a few line to my text and I can't even open the app anymore, can you imagine that I can't restore my texts?! Also, export option won't work!"
12,Marco de Iulio,"December 4, 2019",5," Absolutely great app: complete and stylish.

I'll definitely buy the premium version which unlocks useful features, although the free version is already perfectly enjoyable. Give it a try, you'll love it. EDIT: The text kept disappearing every time I tried to change the theme, but today I tried again and everything's fine, so restarting the app (or the phone, maybe) fixed it. Sorry for not having tried it earlier. Thank you for the quick answer, I appreciate it."
13,Suraj Gupta,"November 29, 2019",4," Great app for those who always have something running on their mind.

Just pick up your phone and write down everything, no searching for pen and paper and no slipping of ideas through your mind. Just one thing for the developers, you should add more pages that can be stashed (at least 10-15) in the free version of the app. Thank you."

Buying ruff+ is a totally worth it experience for me. The app is gradually improving and I love that the developer is willing to listen to others' feedbacks. I would like to suggest a ruff+ feature of writing prompts. Hopefully, if ever the dev decide to really make it, it'll be placed in the store tab so that it'll save the number of tabs. Having a grammar checker feature will also be amazing, if it can be added."
15,Drew Boggess,"January 10, 2020",5," The developer literally bought a Pixelbook just to debug this app for me. THIS is the kind of developer we should support in the Play Store. I love this app. Let me count the ways. 1. Responsive, wonderful developer 2. Great, intuitive design 3. Multi-device sync 4. Beautiful app. BUY THIS APP."
16,Furkan T√ºrkal,"December 6, 2019",5," Excellent! Fluent! Modern! No annoying UI things. I haven't had seen such a great thing until now. Will you and Sync features? Syncing with G Keep, also I would be very happy if you add support for Emacs org-mode sync via local network. Thanks!"
17,Kasinath Ravi,"December 8, 2019",5, Very responsive Developer - Bardi. Very handy and useful notemaking app. The issue which I reported a few days back was looked into with absolute priority and update was provided which totally fixed it. Keep rockingüòäüëçüëå
18,Jakub Sad√≠lek,"November 6, 2019",5," Pleasure to use. Pretending to not know much tricks, but this pup will blow your mind. Just use it once."
19,Anshul Singh,"December 4, 2019",4, Can you decrease the price of the pro version. Also add a quick launch button on notification area. I want a button in notification area that can quickly launch ruff to take quick notes.
20,KANG Augus,"November 11, 2019",4," I really hope two new functions. 1. We can share screenshots of words to others. 2. Could insert photos into words, it is so useful."
21,Vivan Doshi,"December 11, 2019",4, Ok so the app is amazing! I can't get hold of stashing! But once i have filled my note whenever i type it starts lagging please look into it
22,N√≠colas Lima,"December 17, 2019",3," Great app, just bought pro license. Although the lack of sync with Windows 10 app is pretty frustrating."
23,Nucleus Rhyme,"December 9, 2019",2," This is a half baked text editor that can't do multiple files, but will show you ads. So much for a declared offline app!"
24,Alex Wingert,"December 15, 2019",5," Great design, very straight forward, and gets the job done."
25,Ben Hendry,"January 2, 2020",5," Very nice note taking app, definitely worth buying the pro version, support the developer"
26,C. Tarun Kumar,"November 9, 2019",4, Beautifully Designed and Good concept.. Nothing its perfect..i know its for your earning but i feel its little overpriced
27,Andre Lima,"January 7, 2020",5, Wonderful app to quickly write down and access some notes. How do we upgrade to ruff+? Is there an in-app upgrade icon I haven't seen? Also: Does ruff export to Markdown?
28,Khaja Sheraz,"December 3, 2019",5, Good but the +version is expensive than it must be.
29,Andrey Kraszewski,"January 4, 2020",4," Nice and minimalistic notepad, but.. There is no mono font for cyrrilc? :( Only for Latin symbols?"
30,Amit Purkait,"December 4, 2019",3, Not showing settings... Kindly fix it.. Edited: Yes it's empty.
31,Sangam Panda,"February 14, 2020",5, The best eveer... Writing experience you can experience on any android device Just love the app Thanks dev for an amazing app like this ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
32,raja sekhar,"December 5, 2019",3, Need to work on UI Little features need to add whoch are useful and most used
33,Suraj H,"December 23, 2019",5, It's one of the beautiful note app. It's perfect for my usage. Thank you.
34,Alex Kaduk,"December 30, 2019",5, Loved it! Piece of art in app dev
35,Bassel Makhlouf,"January 21, 2020",5," Great app, I've bought the premium version... One question though, are you thinking of supporting the the S Pen on the Galaxy Note series?..."
36,jimmy yadav,"December 26, 2019",4, I've liked the design and UI of the application but one thing that i didn't liked about it is that the limited number of notes we can save on the device. They should have allowed more notes in the free version.
37,Monirules Blog,"February 9, 2020",3, No backups..if uninstalled all gone

A bit different from other quick note taking apps but the more you use it the more sense it makes and using it becomes intuitive. Recommended üëç

The UI definitely deserves it - it's intuitive and minimalistic, and the whole concept is just something insanely awesome. The only downside is the font - it doesn't support Cyrillic or any other non-latin scripts. Adding custom fonts could certainly make it nearly perfect"
41,Akash Gupta,"September 2, 2019",5," A superb minimal notes app, well worth the money keep it up! üòÑ I would have given 4 üåü because there are some features missing but since you promised you to add those features here is your 5 üåü. Kudos to this minimal app, it's rarely to find such beautiful app to find on android."
42,Tymur Lv,"October 20, 2019",5," Fantastic app. Design and usability is exceptional. It is very rare to see so well designed apps on Android. Two feature requests: - sync with windows app - file/picture attachments Bought ruff+ plus to support the developer. By the way, Windows app is great too."
43,t. troupe,"August 28, 2019",5," I absolutely love this app. The clean simplicity is an immensely welcoming environment to write ANYTHING, be it a short blurb or longer copy. Its like digital scribble pad for those that have the writing bug. The ability to stash pieces for retrieval and editing is GREAT to have."
44,quicwaterr,"August 11, 2019",1," It is a free app but if you want more than a page you have to pay. Not a bad thing but that is very unclear here. To repeat stashing isn't a thing until you pay, one page as a free app."
45,Marvin P.,"July 14, 2019",5," Great app for writing without distractions on my phone. The user interface is modern and gets out of my way. As a long time user of Appy Text on Windows Mobile 10 and Windows 10, this one's a no-brainer!"
46,Matt Winters,"October 14, 2019",5, Writing a book and needed something to jot down ideas. This is absolutely perfect. Opened it up and it took just a few minutes to realize I was gonna be getting the pro version. Thanks for this.
47,Harry Tran Designs,"July 16, 2019",5, very clean ui. gets the job done when i need to write something quickly down for later. because there arent any buttons and things in the way i can think clearly before i jot something down.
48,Sebastian McLane,"October 13, 2019",5," Grabbed the premium pretty much up front, support developers! Love the layout and functionality. I'm currently using as a quick daily journal in addition to not taking."
49,Sourav Saha,"September 6, 2019",3, After the recent update the app is not opening at all. I had some important data but not able to use. Update : After a day I received another update which fixed the earlier issue of aap not opening.
50,Jason Walker,"October 13, 2019",5," Beautiful app. The update works beautiful on my OnePlus 7 Pro. Deleted every other similar app, this is all I need. Shout out to the developer for putting in work to give us this genius product."
51,Cindy Wang,"October 20, 2019",5," Can't view settings. Edit: Sorry, to be more specific, swiping right opens the settings page, but it is a blank white screen. Store, FAQ, About, etc. are also blank."
52,Irshad Ali,"October 28, 2019",5, I just love the App ‚ù§Ô∏è How clean & How functional it is and I brought full version now I am happy. üë®‚Äçüíª Expecting some feature like: 1. Ruled Page 2. Highlight some text
53,Lawrence Lee,"October 24, 2019",4," Nice UI, except I don't understand the 1x 2x 3x notation which I think means jump to next word, next line, end of page."
54,Avinash Sharma,"October 12, 2019",4, One of the best writing app. Just need password protection and multiple account/ folder feature to be perfect.
55,Babak G,"June 28, 2019",5, Been looking for something like this for a while and whilst I rarely pay for an app it's practically free at the price it's listed at. Check it out
56,Jason Kohlhoff,"October 19, 2019",5, Cool concept! A no frills note taking app that lets you focus on the text. The latest update feels faster! üòâ
57,Ryan M,"August 28, 2019",3," Good features, good idea, but if a 6GB ram phone cant operate it for half an hour without the app crashing something is wrong."
58,Farah Makdisi,"July 10, 2019",5, Nice and lightweight and easy to use. Great for sharing notes.
59,Mario Monterrosa,"October 15, 2019",5," Simple, clean, easy to use, very well designed. Pro upgrade is worth it."
60,Jason Ellis,"June 28, 2019",5, Works exactly as advertised. Also works nicely on my Pixelbook.
61,catalin ciprian Andronic,"October 14, 2019",5, Nice app. Clean interface. Just what I was looking for. One question: is there an option to search through the stashed notes? I couldn't find it.
62,Mulat,"October 10, 2019",5, Note something... saved automatically .. close the app with no worry... worth to upgrade pro version.. love it..
