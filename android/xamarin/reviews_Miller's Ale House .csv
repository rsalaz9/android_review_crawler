0,Michelle Napoletano,"January 21, 2020",1," I live in Lady Lake, less than a mile from a Miller's Ale House. The app has set my restaurant to Ocala, a good 40 miles away. And yes location was on; and no, it wouldn't let me change it. If this isn't fixed I would never use the app because it's useless to me."
1,Gerard Condello,"January 25, 2020",3, The app seems pretty good but you should have an option to see the menu before you start an order.
2,Ewen Mackenzie,"April 12, 2020",5," Simple and straight. Order, pick up, enjoy"
3,Kitty Moore,"March 18, 2020",2," As soon as you choose to pick up order later (instead of ASAP), the app closes. There's no way to pick up at a later time on the app."
4,V Cox,"December 20, 2019",5," Easy, lots of selections available"
5,Ariel Raymond,"January 19, 2020",5, Great service and perfect order
6,Daniel Landrum,"February 8, 2020",1, Only for ordering takeout. Cannot add yourself to the wait list. Don't need another app to order food. Can use GrubHub for that. The app should focus on getting you to your table!
7,Steven Goldman,"January 6, 2020",5, Easy to order on the app!
8,J. Mule,"October 28, 2019",3," Overall a well designed, user friendly app. It would be nice if you could add a way to cancel an order, in case of a mistake. I.E. Order is placed for pickup, but customer needs delivery. Mistakes happen folks."
9,Rich McGlynn,"August 26, 2019",5," If I'm rating the app then sure it's like any other app. the food however is very good so far I've had the prime rib sandwich but they forgot the au jus sauce, I've also had the bacon cheeseburger which was very very good and tonight I ordered some zingers so we'll find out. All is to go, never ate ...Full ReviewIf I'm rating the app then sure it's like any other app. the food however is very good so far I've had the prime rib sandwich but they forgot the au jus sauce, I've also had the bacon cheeseburger which was very very good and tonight I ordered some zingers so we'll find out.

10,Joseph Micetich,"September 11, 2019",5," You WILL love this place. We have tried wings, big red, salads, pasta and it has all been of very high quality. Delivery is efficient and food temperature has always been on point. Pick up service is great as well."
11,Joshua Giesegh,"April 29, 2019",5," Not sure why i would ever use the app since I'd rather just stop by the Florida Mall location and see all the lovely people while getting good food, but love the idea!"
