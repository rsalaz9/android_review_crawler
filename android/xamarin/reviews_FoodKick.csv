0,psyches harp,"April 22, 2020",2," Difficulties logging on to make purchases. Zip code information would vanish and when I attempted to re-enter info, I received an error. I still had issues after uninstalling and reinstalling more than 3 times. This issue has been going on since February."
1,Carolyn Baskis,"March 31, 2020",1," It's supposed to be a NYC delivery service but the zip codes never work. Can't order without using the chat feature for help. If they are busy and no one is available, forget about your order."
2,Michael Sommer,"February 16, 2020",1," After you place your order, they imediately place a hold for the full amount for everything you ordered, and state that it's all on the way. However what you receive is somewhat random, based on what actually happens to be in their warehouse. Don't count on receiving a fill list for a recipe."
3,Marian Dennis,"October 25, 2019",2, I keep getting a pop-up box telling me about produce freshness rating. Once was enough. It popped up literally 20 times the last time I shopped. Think this is a bug on Android app. I just switched from iPhone and never had this issue on old phone.
4,Nick Nienaber,"November 21, 2018",3, Love the service but the app is really bad. Why do I need to log in and enter my address every time I use it? I usually end up opening a Chrome tab on my phone because it's a lot faster.
5,Nick Barbati,"June 16, 2019",1," wont let me login, says not conmected to network though i am able to browse the site"
6,blondell jackson,"January 21, 2019",2, I love the service but the app sucks. i have to restart my phone evey time I order for it to work.
7,Kate Raizenberg,"September 16, 2019",1, Regularly does not show item images or load properly.
8,Bob Manix-Cramer,"June 27, 2019",2, love the service. app is frequently unusable
9,Yvette Yasui,"January 10, 2019",4, Slow app. Fast food delivery though.
10,A Google user,"January 21, 2019",5, Smh! If only there was 10 stars!üòç
11,Tom Joynt,"November 16, 2019",1, Can't enter zip code
12,A Google user,"July 25, 2018",1," Ever since the intro to 9.99 monthly unlimited deliveries. Can never get 
same day anymore all slots always taken"
13,Symon Hallam,"February 23, 2018",2," This app is buggy as hell. It's not showing all the items I purchased in the basket, so ultimately I abandoned my purchase. Very annoyed!"
14,Paul Collins,"February 11, 2018",5," Order was perfect, nicely packaged and the gentleman who delivered walked up five flights of stairs to my apartment and was very nice.  I'll be using food kick again for sure."
15,Anthony Roulhac,"December 30, 2017",5," My neighbor had been trying to get us to do FK for quite awhile. Finally decided to give it a shot and this **** is life changing. Granted I've only used it for beer, but its nice to not have to ever leave the house when the wife is out of town and I'm spending the weekend binge watching shows.

Granted I've only used it for beer, but its nice to not have to ever leave the house when the wife is out of town and I'm spending the weekend binge watching shows. Life. Is. Good. üòé Works completely fine on the LG V20 by the way. One would even say... ""Flawlessly""."
16,Alon Hillel-Tuch,"December 10, 2017",1," Opted out of push notifications, but FoodKick still pushes promo notifications, jerks..."
17,A Google user,"October 26, 2017",1," This app is ridiculously poor, randomly refuses to log me in even with a reset password. Fresh Direct has terrible tech, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
18,James Lawry,"October 29, 2017",1," The option to log in with FreshDirect failed because my FreshDirect account password didn't meet a requirement that FreshDirect doesn't impose but FoodKick does. Fine, app deleted, good bye."
19,Jameson Tyler,"July 16, 2017",2," Consistently logs out after a session, but at least I can modify orders after I place them. Delivery address is somehow misplaced after logging back in‚Ä¶"
20,Sarah Scott-Edwards,"July 23, 2017",2, 90% of time the app loads without and items.
21,Christina Barnes,"June 15, 2017",1, I don't like that you can't see the discount after a promo code is applied. You can only put the promo code in the box then submit your order without knowing whether the discount works. This needs to change then I would give the app a better rating
22,Christina Mixon,"June 10, 2017",1," Current  app won't let me select a delivery time, so can finish the order"
23,Markus Schober,"July 13, 2017",2, This app is just a glorified website. You're probably better off using their real mobile site.
24,Eric Lammertsma,"February 19, 2017",1," It's a great service but provides no settings for notifications. I appreciate the delivery notifications but loathe spam. It sends you ads every other day or so. Even if you're into sales, the ads are just reminders to spend more, often with no sales or deals going on. I'd love to be able to disable...Full ReviewIt's a great service but provides no settings for notifications. I appreciate the delivery notifications but loathe spam. It sends you ads every other day or so. Even if you're into sales, the ads are just reminders to spend more, often with no sales or deals going on. I'd love to be able to disable those without disabling my delivery status notifications."
25,Marissa von Krosigk,"March 5, 2017",3," It's great when it works, but that's not often enough. Half the time I open it, no foods show up so I can't order."
26,elise waugh,"February 12, 2017",1," All of the delivery slots are always filled up, so it really doesn't get to you until 4-5 hours after you order it. What's the point of this app if you have to wait so long...?"
27,A Google user,"January 2, 2017",3,Nice service but the app is buggy I like Foodkick due to its convenience and selection. The app however has a nasty bug. If the app is minimized and reopened it signs you out. I have to exit and reopen the app to sign in again. It's annoying especially when you are switching between apps.
28,Matt Krupnick,"February 2, 2017",1," Avoid this service. We used FoodKick several times and they never once got our order correct. At least one item was missing every time, which is a real bummer to discover when you're in the middle of a recipe."
29,mailily,"December 31, 2016",5,"Very handy Delivery is spot on, delivery attendants are on time and courteous. Filtering in the app itself could be improved, but I really enjoy the convenience."
30,Laura Flatow-Eisenhauer,"November 13, 2016",3,"Has improved a lot, but needs a bit more ux Quick chat feature is great and can resolve most questions. Filtering could still be a bit smarter to help you find products quickly. A little unclear on how much meat /cheese you're buying from the counter/deli. Food delivery is a bit slow, but quality so good."
31,Rose Fox,"October 26, 2016",1,Useless I tried to search for gluten free options and only got packaged food. I found some prepared meals that looked interesting but there was no allergen or ingredient information. I tried chatting with the support staff and they were very helpful but the app crashed twice while using the chat. I give up.

And  I got $15 off my first purchase of 30.

33,Beth McCrea,"October 28, 2016",4,"Best quick food delivery service in NYC! I use FreshDirect. For same day delivery I've used all the other options out there....& this is the best! The app is easy to use, clean & fast. I got my 1st delivery 25 freakin minutes after I placed my order! And the delivery guy was super happy & nice.

34,Akintayo Holder,"November 5, 2016",1, Can't login. Can't register.
35,Whitney Reynolds,"September 26, 2016",5,"Use it all the time Can't get  better than getting groceries, household stuff, and BOOZE delivered in an hour! App gets better/easier to use every update"

I've used it quite a few times now and its still great. Food always comes at the right temperature, packaged well, the delivery guys are great. Meals ready to eat or ""meal hacks"" are delicious, creative, and they have vegetarian options too which i personally always appreciate. They also have a good selection of household supplies to help keep you going."

The cart doesn't refresh when you delete items, the pop up error messages were blank before but now show cryptic messages. Delivery time slots that are full/unavailable still keep showing as available so you have to keep guessing, going to the next time slot down hoping your order goes through. Also, there is no Android Pay support. Please address this."
38,Nicholas Tang,"June 1, 2016",2," Great concept, poor execution.  The app is a buggy mess, sometimes it works great, sometimes I get error after error.

The app is a buggy mess, sometimes it works great, sometimes I get error after error.  I seem to get the most errors while trying to check out, which is probably the *worst* time to get them.    I've tried to buy things from them multiple times, and have succeeded one time so far.  I really *want* this to work, but most of the time, no good.  This feels like it launched around 3 months early - should've spent more time fixing bugs first."
39,Bryan Carroll,"May 28, 2016",1,Horribly buggy and underdeveloped This is a disgrace of an app. Do some QA before releasing to the public
40,Chris Woodard,"May 17, 2016",5,Awesome food- FASt Great app and concept. High quality food And booze delivered the same day- what's not to love?
41,Chris Kopsachilis,"May 17, 2016",5, Nice!
42,Oleg QA Baby,"May 6, 2016",5,Amazing What a great app. Amazing look and feel. Easy to navigate. Love it!
43,Mehmet Umut Erme√ß,"September 24, 2016",1,"Misleading They don't serve the neighborhoods they say they serve. You can even try making sure they serve your address by entering your zipcode on the website, but it won't mean anything, you'll learn at the checkout of they really serve or not. I learned the hard way. Don't waste your time"
44,A Google user,"December 17, 2017",1, Made an order on this and i was unable to log into check status after it passed the delivery time.  Had to call in to cancel my order.  Terrible service.  Its faster to just go to the store to buy what you need.
45,Johnna Scrabis,"May 18, 2016",1,"Crashes What a huge waste of time. I tried for 20 minutes to work through their buggy glitchy system. Never did get to order anything for lunch. I wanted to pay you, foodkick! Alas."

Since I stopped using FD years ago, I had no idea what my password was. So, it sent me in circles to create a new one. Once that was done, it refused to recognize it once I tried logging on again!!  Also, be prepared to endure lots of cutesy comments like ""Remembering things is hard!"" and ""Can you input your 'deets' again?""  Who is their target customer?  Kindergarteners?"
47,L C,"December 12, 2016",1,Kept crashing hard to search - immediately uninstalled Kept going to a blank screen and locking - had to chat w/cust svc re my order and it crashed so I had to call. Fd app is awful too so maybe like that this is just better online
48,Narendra Babulal,"June 22, 2016",5,Great app!!! And now on android YEA... Always to my rescue with food and my daily essentials within an hour.
49,Quality Assurance,"May 6, 2016",5, Love it's functionality.......Renu
50,Germanie Cerisier,"October 2, 2017",5, I think this app is good to the people who can't go anywhere
51,Alan Stowe,"October 20, 2017",1, Enough with the push notifications. No way to turn them off. Deleting.
52,gary Rodriguez,"October 15, 2016",5,I love cooking I love cooking
53,Sharnada Griffin,"March 2, 2017",5, Love it
