Today I had a total of 8 new posts over 10 hours and even the ads didn't change, no matter how often I signed in and out, refreshed or turned my phone on or off. I finally uninstalled and now I have no news feeds at all. The system keeps telling me it can't connect. Yet I can post and use all my other apps perfectly fine. Please fix the glitch."

I was trying to edit my personal info on my account & hit the wrong thing and was immediately locked out. Facebook asked for documents to verify my identity, which I have provided, too many times to count, over the last 2 weeks. I've had no response from Facebook & my account is still locked.There is no way to contact Facebook directly to resolve this issue. I can't contact, friends,family or business associates"

Great part about FB is being able to select the privacy for for posts in such a detailed manner.

Now you have to open it to hear it, instead of just being able to watch and listen from your feed. Then the video is on this small screen with a huge section for comments or other video suggestions across the bottom. I don't like it. Wish it was back to the old way. Unnecessary changes and updates that don't improve use. Facebook is so annoying with their changes."

If you start watching a video on your timeline and then click to watch the whole thing, it starts from the beginning everytime. You need to press back button 2-3 times to exit. There are so many buttons on the interface while watching the videos, if you try to just check how long the video is, something gets pressed and either it skips to the next video or skips 10 seconds or restarts. Why fix what's not broken?"

My only major really painfully frustrating problem is that I don't get push notifications on my Galaxy S10. I've triple checked all notification settings on my phone and on the app, they just don't work. I had a bit of luck the other day after enabling Email notifications for everything. Some push notifications came through, probably for about 2 days, then it just stopped sending me any. Email notifications always work for me, but its not ideal...the Galaxy S10 sometimes takes a while to refresh emails in Gmail, so I often miss important posts from people I follow. Please could you look into the issue and resolve it, it would be very much appreciated. Thank you."

Getting really close to everyday and all they do is make it impossible to navigate easily as it changes so often. you figure it out and next time it is different or you can't figure out how to get to what you want. Can't remove or change things to personal preference like removing ""watch list"" or changing what is on it. I would rather see more of my friends & group posts than the commercial pages, especially the OLD/rerun stories."

How many updates are required? It's understandable that fb is a big company and working hard to ensure app stability.

Now there is a new issue. I can see some of my pictures in an album with 80ish photos. I could scroll down maybe roughly 15 pictures then i get the spinning icon letting me know it's trying to load the next pictures, but it's really not. I have tried to test this on other android phones I have and they're at acting the same way. Now I try to look at the album using my iPhone and that works just fine. I'm leaning more and more towards iPhone now just because of how buggy these android apps are and bloatwares. Another thing, Facebook's new algorithm on who it thinks should see your posts is terrible. Only a fraction of my friends and family are seeing my posts now because your algorithm doesn't want to ""spam"" people with posts it thinks people wont want to see; meaning my posts. THENNNN you guys shove a bunch of paid ads into our faces instead?? 2019 Reveiw: After digging deep into the phone clearing out so much data and cached files, testing it with other phones, and etc, I have finally found the answer.. It was the Android Facebook update. Clicking a picture from my news feed that has multiple pictures kind of freezes the app. You can press the back button on the Android phone to unfreeze it. The average person that clicks on my picture via their home feed would probably think their app is frozen and close it out then open up again then wouldn't see my new posts with my travel pics anymore on their news feed since it was already shown on their feed. I have confirmed this is the case only with Androids so far testing it on 5 Androids unsuccessfully looking at my albums via the feed. iPhone users still can view photos via the feed, though. I do see another recent review saying the same thing. The work around for this, which I know people wont do unless they really like you or know you, would be to go to my the person's page, click on Photos, then choose that specific album they want to see. Sorry for the giant wall of text of a review. Google kills the format and shoves it into a giant block of a review."

I don't search these videos but they keep showing in my feed. I have further tried to hide the video icon from the main header.

440,Raza Afridi,"April 15, 2020",4, The app is now much more stable and has great and improved changes to its interface. One thing missing is the option for changing Theme to Dark Mode which I believe would be a great addition to the Facebook App. The mixture of Facebook Flagship Blue Color with Black Theme would be a beautiful combo.

I don't have access because I don't have the email address or phone number or password every time I try to log in it comes up in a foreign language and it's annoying to say the least I think Facebook should open a hotline or something to simplify when people are not computer literate or to old to understand .. face recognition or something?

600,Nico Guzman,"April 19, 2020",3, Videos take way too long to load and they need to constantly load again every few seconds. Also when you're watching videos the app suddenly refreshes the page and takes you back to the homepage no matter if you were watching something.

Constantly submitting the same bug reports over and over again and developers never seem to fix software problems. Developers apparently never update with software patches.

I would recommend downloading and using Facebook Lite instead of this terrible app.

Seems like every time I find a story that I decide I want to read Facebook besides that's a good time to update and then snatches that story away from me. Worst part is most the time those stories are suggested posts from people that aren't even friends so it's really hard to find them again. It would be really nice if there was just a button in one of the top corners specifically for updating Facebook posts.

2232,A Jones,"April 1, 2020",3," Facebook takes up too much space. It needs to have the option to move to the SD card.

Landscape mode arbitrarily reverts to vertical mod...Full ReviewThree big problems: 1. Need to add oldest first to the choice for comment review. Revelant fist is ok but stinks of Big Brother. 2. Newsfeed is too arbitrary. We need to see newest posts first. 3. Disabled members need consistency viewing all posts. Landscape mode arbitrarily reverts to vertical mode. WHY? Those of us with vision and agility problems are being hampered when the orientation we choose is altered. I bet it doesn't off happen to those who view everything in vertical mode.

Facebook has sold shares to PETA who are controlling what can be sold on Facebook. They think this is making it safer to rehome animals when its not. It used to be you could post an animal, research the peoples profile who contacted you and do everything that way. More animals were rehomed quickly and to better fitting homes when you could use facebook."

I don't think Facebook cares about their users' experience when it involves taking action upon violent or hateful posts. Please improve this as it can help Facebook become a more peaceful community. Although Twitter is a ""toxic"" platform, at least they suspend violent users and do their best to cope with the reports being sent. Their help center is helpful. Do the same."
