Yet when I try to order online it keeps trying to force me to go to the app, so I end up using another service Additionally, when I was able to use it, the menus were not complete and did not offer everything the restaurants do, had a minimum of $1.50 mark up on each item, charged additional money for sides that are included, charges $5 for delivery and then adds an additional $6 - $7 for service fees."
1,Erica Ellis,"April 3, 2020",5, App worked great. There were a lot of options. The app let me personalize at the restaurant page. Will use again.
2,Shane King,"April 16, 2020",1," Horrible experience. Thried to place an order, but the app said the card was declined and the order did not go through.

But yet somehow, they were able to charge my card for the order even though it did not go through and it said my card was charged. There was no delivery and 4 days later I'm still trying to get my money back from these thieves... NEVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE THIEVES!"
3,Sebastian Cal√≥nico,"April 24, 2020",1, Stay away! The app does not work. I got several fraudulent charges from Uptown Wine Pantry while trying to place an order and now no one is taking responsibility. I can see from other reviews I was not the only one. Horrible experience. STAY AWAY!
4,Brittany Gomez,"April 3, 2020",5, Fast easy and so many more options than other bigger delivery apps
5,Mark Norris,"April 8, 2020",5, Easy to use. First time user and no issues
6,Quincy Bjornberg,"April 15, 2020",5," Drivers are always extremely nice, good fast service. Very reliable. Thankful they are doing their jobs so diligently in these times. Kudos!"
7,Lindsey Woods,"March 29, 2020",5, Super easy! And I noticed more local options then were offered through Uber eats or Door Dash.
8,Jessica Erwin,"April 3, 2020",5, Super easy to use and convenient
9,Julie Roy,"April 21, 2020",2, I can't track in the app. Only works through the website.

16,kade estill,"April 23, 2020",5, Simple easy to navigate
17,Joy Hoskins,"January 5, 2020",2," Not easy to navigate. Also it crashes when you try to filter or sort the list of restaurants. And lately even when it sends me a link to track an order, it doesn't work. I like that you can have multiple bags for different orders. I'd like to use it more than other apps, but it's so clunky."
18,Noah Wagstaff,"March 7, 2020",5, A direct improvement from before the rebranding. Restaurants and dishes are now searchable and the minimum cost has been lowered. Now it's everything I want I a delivery app
19,Kyndall Ogle,"March 22, 2020",5, The app was very user-friendly and easy to use. Thrilled to have this in our area!
20,Alisa Schmoak,"March 29, 2020",2, Did NOT get my free delivery even though I clicked on the link in my email and also put in the code when it didn't show up. Said it was applied. Asked for updates on delivery and just got the first one.
21,Nikisha Melendez,"November 25, 2019",5," It's very easy to use and keeps you updated on your order. If you have any issues, the support team gets in touch with you extremely fast and solves your issues just as fast."
22,Courtney Christian,"April 4, 2020",5, Super easy to use.
23,lexie williams,"December 18, 2019",5, Super easy to use and navigate. I love how they offer a pay with cash option. The rest of the apps dont offer that! Would recommend!
24,Michael O.,"March 3, 2020",5, Quick and easy! Little to no fuss on ordering and payment.
25,Garrett Turner,"November 15, 2019",3," I wish the ""track in real time"" still worked but otherwise it works as it should."

27,Randall Edwards,"March 17, 2020",1, Tx2go serviced my address just fine. And now I've got to use this and it doesn't service my address. üôÑ
28,Alex Ruimy,"January 25, 2020",2, The app keeps changing the tip amount between Bag and Checkout. EG: I put $7 and it lowers it to $2. Or it removes the tip altogether. Obviously can't place an order now. Reported this bug a half dozen times over the last year. It keeps coming back to screw over delivery people.
29,Jonathan Chang,"January 21, 2020",2, Fake restaurant ratings. Everything is 4 stars or better--obviously not real. App can be sluggish. Notification spam.
30,Dominique Sturdivant,"April 11, 2020",5," One of the best delivery apps, lots of variety and they are the only delivery app to take cash DO F#*$ IT UP PEOPLE!"
31,Amanda Santander,"December 13, 2019",1, The app crashes every time I try to filter or sort. These are basic functions.

44,Janette Cunningham,"November 12, 2019",5," Intuitive, easy to use"
45,Michael Jemison,"April 24, 2020",1," WARNING: do not use this app. By far the worst of all delivery services. The estimated time is not when you will receive your food, but when they finally get around to sending your order to the restaurant! Figured that out after waiting 2 hours and calling restaurant direct. Just horrible."
46,Kyle McPherron,"February 21, 2020",1," If you enjoy waiting hours for food from a resteraurant 15 minutes away, and eatong cold food this is the app for you. Grubhub, doordash or uber eats are a much better service."
47,Sam Roddenberry,"February 5, 2020",4, Tons of options but very expensive.

Promo code registration can be hit or miss. You consistently need to close down the app and redo. As for the service. Several places have better promos ordering direct. Orders have been showing up incomplete. And pickups are pretty slow and unwelcome vs the other services. I would not recommend this service.

PLEASE FIX!!"
62,Rash N,"July 18, 2019",5," I love the using the app. user experience is good but I only hope there are more options to filter the results like lunch special deals, brunch deals, happy hour etc. that will make it so much easier to see which restaurants in the area have on going deals at the moment."
63,Carly Helton,"August 3, 2019",5, The website was very straightforward and easy to navigate. It was also clear where to enter our promo code. I like the additional option to opt-in for text text message alerts...on the status of a current order.

65,Honey Pot,"January 7, 2020",4, Just nice to be able to get anything besides pizza in Bozeman.
66,Debanjan Dey,"September 4, 2019",4," App is clean and functional. One bug is that it does not allow you to enter a custom $ tip. There's a space to enter it, but when you reach the checkout page, it reverts back to the % selection (10%, 15% etc)."
67,Janya K Comer,"April 12, 2020",5, Pretty amazing app!
68,C D Cadogan,"May 31, 2019",3," The app promoted as a helper, needs some help... The app freezes and becomes unresponsive. The complete listing of options offered by the vendor are not available. And customer support is not always available."

70,Jordan Lucht,"July 6, 2019",5," I used to use DoorDash but they only have a few places, and I always have tons of problems. I love this app, has 3x more restaurants than DD and have yet to have a problem. love it!"

The app and the communication pipeline is just broken. Failed me twice when I tried to order food for a friend in different time zone.

105,CORI MADNESS,"April 22, 2019",5, a little cheaper on taxes than grubhub and seamless. And everything you buy gives points towards free stuff. I just wish the points moved faster since im not ordering all the time. There's also alcohol and laundry!

Both times they didn't inform me that the order had been canceled and I waited for the food to arrive before calling to check with the restaurant only to find out the order had never even been placed. The only reason I ordered again was to use the credit they offered the first time. I will not be using the additional credit they've offered of a whopping $15. Incredibly disappointing considering they actually advertise lower prices than GrubHub or DoorDash for the same restaurant."

127,Scott Schreiber,"January 24, 2019",5, The restaurant I ordered from had a 15% discount on orders over $25. And I actually found a promo code online that worked as well (a rarity for most delivery service apps) and got another 15% off!! Wahoo!!!

My first delivery was super quick, but that might be due to just dumb luck. The real reason I'm giving 5 stars is because grub hub, seamless, and uber eats, are using dishonest practices by sneaking in additional charges (mostly $1) per item versus the restaurant's original menu.

Called customer services for assistance. They said it was deactivated for fraud. I checked my accounts and I had no fraudulent charges. They said they'd submit a review but nothing was ever done. Say goodbye to a frequent user. Guess I'll just call the stores directly for services and order food with GrubHub.
1036,S,"October 11, 2013",1,"Does not list restaurants The list doesn't populate with restaurants in my area, even though they exist on the Web site. The only restaurant it displayed was from my last order.   Sign in seems to work, but the app is pretty useless. Disappointingly so."

1040,Adam Kantor,"June 8, 2015",1,Useless app The menus are often incomplete. The app is usually unresponsive when you try to select something. You may as well delete it and just use Seamless.
1041,Christopher Hollingsworth,"October 31, 2015",2,"Really lame app compared to seamless Can't search menu by category. Sometimes you can't order pizza it says it's unavailable, so I switch over to seamless and use it to order pizza from the same restaurant.

1042,Renee Heslop,"February 16, 2015",2,A waste No one delivers in my area. I want to buy grocery not take out. I love too do my own grocery shopping but the weather that I am having right now I don't want to go out side. Get more merchants to delivery in Brooklyn 11226 area.

Tried to order, kept refreshing the ""delivery location"" screen every single time I submitted it so I couldn't progress.

1049,Deanna White,"November 30, 2017",1, Customer service from Sonia was horrible. And the communication with the restaurant is worse. I was told by two restaurants 15 after placing my order that I was too far for delivery.  Sounds like the type of thing a service like this should know.
