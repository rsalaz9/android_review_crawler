I learned of a new one today that has collected more of my data. I keep the highest privacy settings for a reason. Stay out of my business. I barely use Facebook and even then, only to keep in touch with a few people. It is none of their business what I do outside my use of their app. None! Big Brother much?"
1,Natasha O'Neal,"April 20, 2020",3," Overall it's okay but there are a couple things that annoy me. 1) The same 4 or 5 posts are at the top of my timeline all day, even when it says they were posted the day before.

When I refresh, they're still there. I'd like to see others' posts too. 2) I'll be in the middle of watching a video and the app will randomly refresh back to the top of my timeline. This has happened way too often. At this point, I'd rather log on through the internet on my phone than have the app"

Lately when I enter Facebook on my tablet my screen reader takes very long to respond. However, when I tap on a post so I can read that post my screen reader works perfectly fine. As for messenger or e-mail, etc, my screen reader responds perfectly. So, I guess I should say, it's with the browsing or scroling through posts I seam to have a problem. Android version 4.4 and TalkBack version 5.7."

The ""off Facebook activity"" section. Monitoring things i do on my phone wheather it has nothing to do with Facebook or not? Are you kidding? I believe this to be an invasion of privacy. Yes you have the option to turn it off, If you know about it that is. Which most people don't because Facebook hasn't told anyone. Who do you people think you are collecting that information? Wow"

I don't like the random page refreshes while I'm reading an article linked to in the post or commenting or replying to it or occasionally while writing my own post. I used to be able to get back to where I was by reacting or commenting on a post and then using my activity log links back to the post or to find my comments. That link no longer works."

Can't take screenshots, laggy all along. Won't mind at all to explain this app is bad, because it is so necessary. Yet so annoying to interact with and let's not talk about how they separate all functional tweaks in other apps like messenger and creator studio, which both were totally functional inside the same app. Does Facebook wanna hear opinions to improve? Of course not, that's why I won't mind elaborate."

The people using this app are all raving loonys and the strictness of what your name can be is terrible. I found the layout so confusing and old looking that it made me want to hang myself. The only reason I made an account on this pointless excuse of an social network was to link a game account and after my experiance that will stay the only reason. Frankly get any other social network.

Now there is a new issue. I can see some of my pictures in an album with 80ish photos. I could scroll down maybe roughly 15 pictures then i get the spinning icon letting me know it's trying to load the next pictures, but it's really not. I have tried to test this on other android phones I have and they're at acting the same way. Now I try to look at the album using my iPhone and that works just fine. I'm leaning more and more towards iPhone now just because of how buggy these android apps are and bloatwares. Another thing, Facebook's new algorithm on who it thinks should see your posts is terrible. Only a fraction of my friends and family are seeing my posts now because your algorithm doesn't want to ""spam"" people with posts it thinks people wont want to see; meaning my posts. THENNNN you guys shove a bunch of paid ads into our faces instead?? 2019 Reveiw: After digging deep into the phone clearing out so much data and cached files, testing it with other phones, and etc, I have finally found the answer.. It was the Android Facebook update. Clicking a picture from my news feed that has multiple pictures kind of freezes the app. You can press the back button on the Android phone to unfreeze it. The average person that clicks on my picture via their home feed would probably think their app is frozen and close it out then open up again then wouldn't see my new posts with my travel pics anymore on their news feed since it was already shown on their feed. I have confirmed this is the case only with Androids so far testing it on 5 Androids unsuccessfully looking at my albums via the feed. iPhone users still can view photos via the feed, though. I do see another recent review saying the same thing. The work around for this, which I know people wont do unless they really like you or know you, would be to go to my the person's page, click on Photos, then choose that specific album they want to see. Sorry for the giant wall of text of a review. Google kills the format and shoves it into a giant block of a review."

Can't get facebook to work, it cuts off each side of the screen when I'm in marketplace. It's very frustrating. Sometimes I try to respond to a comment it goes to the cut off screen too. May have something to do with the vertical and horizontal because marketplace is only in vertical."

It doesn't matter what I try to do, scrolling, comment on a post, post a picture, it just freezes and flashes like it's stuck. I've cleared the cache, deleted and reinstalled, and rebooted my phone multiple times. It has been doing this for a week."

Before Facebook in was constantly forgetting to keep in touch with everyone except work. I was always working so I was always in contact with work. But now staying in contact is easier, but excuses harder to find when I don't want to keep in touch,lol.

235,Iuliana Vasilache,"April 20, 2020",2, The Share feature is broken. I try to share anything from FB app to FB messenger and it redirects me to a screen with Switch accounts and if I tap on my account (only one account linked) nothing happens... This happend since last week... Thanks!!
236,Libby Bowden,"April 21, 2020",1, Last few updates have screwed up the app now marketplace is cutting off the side of posts so you can't see the full advert and now messenger keeps coming up to switch account but it's already logged in to my account. When it works leave it alone.
237,Lanz Dare,"April 20, 2020",4," It's good. If it had a dark mode, like Messenger, that'd be even better. EDIT: Okay, FaceBook Lite's got a dark mode, while Messenger Lite does not. Either that or I just don't know how to activate it. Still, I'll be waiting for the dark mode."

My FB account is linked to email address that I no longer access to, so trying to recover my FB has been unsuccessful. I've followed all steps given to recover. Also, as suggested, contacted the email company to help with recovery of my email address, to retain security codes sent from FB, unsuccessful. I unfortunately, had not set myself up for the proper recovery to my FB account. The ""help"" that FB offers, is not very helpful!"
